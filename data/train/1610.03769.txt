    "risk and reward are two integral parts of investing .",
    "thus , we have expected return ( which we can reasonably expect at some future time by investing into a given instrument ) based on some considerations rooted in data available to us now .",
    "if this expected return is positive and guaranteed , then it is a no - brainer : we invest and reap the reward .",
    "however , few things in life are guaranteed ( barring death and taxes ) .",
    "our investment in all likelihood bears some risk , which in some cases can be ( gu)estimated based on historical data .",
    "the question is , is there a relationship between risk and return that can tell us whether an investment is a  good \" one ?",
    "the sharpe ratio @xcite provides a simple measure of such a relationship . up to a normalization constant ( see below ) it is simply the ratio of the expected return over the volatility ( or the historical standard deviation of realized returns ) . however , the sharpe ratio depends on the time horizon for which it is calculated .",
    "e.g. , daily expected return and volatility give us daily sharpe ratio , which is on average lower ( by a factor of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the approximate number of trading days in a year , if we focus on stocks ) than the annualized sharpe ratio . if the daily expected return and volatility do not change much in time , then the sharpe ratio goes to infinity as @xmath5 with the time horizon @xmath6 .",
    "so , a practical way of thinking about the sharpe ratio is that , if , say , the annualized sharpe ratio is 2 , then the probability of losing money in a given year is less than about 2.3% ( assuming normally distributed realized returns , that is , which can be farfetched  see below ) .",
    "is a normally distributed variable with mean @xmath7 and standard deviation @xmath8 , then we have the following probabilities : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . the probability of losing money when the sharpe ratio equals @xmath13 ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) then is @xmath15",
    "so , we have @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "however , this does not take into account leverage , margin calls , investor withdrawals and other such nuances . ]",
    "so , is there a simple criterion which tells us , based on the expected return and volatility , if an investment is ( not ) worthwhile in the long term ?",
    "the answer is yes , at least under some assumptions .",
    "it relates to what constitutes a bubble in the price of an instrument .",
    "hereafter we focus on stocks for the sake of terminological concreteness",
    ". however , our discussion applies to a wider array of instruments .",
    "there is a wealth of literature on bubbles in stock prices ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , which utilizes a complex notion of strict local martingales and the stochastic calculus machinery .",
    "here we deliberately avoid such complexities .",
    "our aim is to discuss the issue as simply and intuitively as possible , and our discussion is intended to be pedagogical , so it is by no means a vigorous mathematical derivation of anything .",
    "we use a simple binary tree to illustrate our main point .",
    "so , what is a stock price bubble ? this is tricky .",
    "it depends , inter alia , on the time horizon .",
    "let us focus on large time horizons .",
    "then we have a bubble if at time @xmath19 the stock price @xmath20 is greater than its fair market price @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the question is , what is this fair market price @xmath21 ?",
    "this is where the volatility comes in .",
    "imagine , just for a second , that the stock price follows a random walk ( or a brownian motion ) .",
    "then , if the expected value of the stock price is constant ( i.e. , the stock process is a martingale ) , holding the stock appears to be a rational thing to do : there is a 50 - 50 chance of making / losing money . however , stock prices are positive , which makes all the difference .",
    "these prices are not normally distributed , but have skewed , long - tailed distributions at the higher end .",
    "thus , if the stock process follows a geometric brownian motion , the prices are log - normally distributed .",
    "if the expected price is constant ( a martingale ) , this no longer means that there is a 50 - 50 chance of making / losing money .",
    "in fact , the most _ probable _ long - run price in this case is _ zero _ ! that is , investing into a stock with a constant expected value of its price is a sure way to lose money !",
    "the stock must have nonzero drift @xmath23 ( whereby its expected value grows as @xmath24 at large @xmath25 ) for investing into the stock to make sense .",
    "the lower bound @xmath26 on the drift is given by @xmath27 .",
    "so , we can define the ratio @xmath28 and we should _ not _ invest into ( non - dividend - paying ) stocks in the long term unless @xmath29 .",
    "the ratio @xmath30 , which apparently has not been named in finance , is dimensionless and , unlike the sharpe ratio , is independent of the time horizon ( if @xmath23 and @xmath8 are ) .",
    "so , positiveness of stock prices , which ( as is the case with many positive - valued quantities ) results in a skewed distribution therefor , coupled with stock volatility creates a long - term asymmetry whereby  on average \" is not the same as  most probably \" , and it is the latter that matters , albeit at times it may be the former that is followed ( behaviorally ) .",
    "we discuss this using a simple binary tree model in section [ sec2 ] , including for dividend - paying stocks .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we tie this to bubbles , and also give ( in a non - exhaustive fashion , solely for illustrative purposes ) some empirical properties of the ratio @xmath30 for a time horizon of about 5 quarters for a broad cross - section of u.s . equities .",
    "we find that log of market cap and sectors appear to be relevant explanatory variables for @xmath30 , but price - to - book ratio ( or its log ) is not .",
    "realized values of @xmath30 are mostly of order 1 , but have a sizable variability .",
    "in section 4 we switch gears and discuss short - horizon effects of volatility , to wit , the analog of the heisenberg uncertainty principle in finance .",
    "a brownian motion is obtained from a free quantum mechanical particle via the so - called wick rotation from usual to euclidean time .",
    "the quantum mechanical position @xmath31 is mapped to the brownian motion process @xmath32 and the velocity @xmath33 is mapped to its derivative @xmath34 .",
    "we discuss how to construct the analogs of quantum mechanical operators in finance and how to derive ( using the binary tree ) the uncertainty principle and explain the key role of _ time ordering _ therefor .",
    "we briefly conclude in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "in this section we will discuss a simple binary tree model in discrete time , which we will use to illustrate some long - horizon properties of stocks .",
    "our initial time will be @xmath35 , and our final time will be @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 , @xmath38 , be @xmath39 discrete points in time , where @xmath40 .",
    "we will take @xmath41 , so @xmath42 .",
    "now consider a process @xmath43 where for each @xmath44 , starting from its value @xmath43 , independently of the history up to time @xmath45 , the process can only take two values at time @xmath46 , to wit , @xmath47 with probability @xmath48 , or @xmath49 with probability @xmath50 . without loss of generality , let us take @xmath51 .",
    "then the average ( i.e. , expected ) value of @xmath43 is @xmath52 . for @xmath53",
    "the process @xmath43 has vanishing expectation , i.e. , it is a driftless random walk . otherwise , if @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 , so @xmath7 is the drift . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath57 is independent of @xmath58 , it follows that the variance @xmath59 ^ 2 = n \\mbox{var}(x_1 ) = t_n\\left[1 - \\mu^2\\tau\\right]$ ] . in the continuous time limit , where we take @xmath60 and @xmath61 while keeping @xmath6 fixed , @xmath43 is nothing but a brownian motion with unit volatility and drift equal @xmath7 .",
    "the process @xmath43 takes both positive and negative values and is therefore unsuitable for modeling stock prices . to circumvent this ,",
    "let us consider the process @xmath62 here @xmath8 is constant log - volatility .",
    "the expected value @xmath63^n = s_0\\exp(\\nu t_n)\\ ] ] where the drift @xmath64\\ ] ] when @xmath65 ( continuous time limit ) , we have @xmath66 .",
    "so , suppose the drift @xmath67 , i.e. , the expected value @xmath68 is independent of time @xmath45 .",
    "this process is known as a martingale .",
    "navely , holding a stock whose price is described by such a driftless process might appear innocuous : on average , its value remains constant .",
    "however , this is an illusion rooted in the fact that this process is strictly positive and log - normally distributed .",
    "indeed , @xmath67 invariably implies that @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath43 has a negative drift , or , equivalently , the probability @xmath70 of @xmath43 taking a step down ( i.e. , that @xmath71 ) is greater than the probability @xmath48 of @xmath43 taking a step up ( i.e. , that @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 . therefore , as @xmath74 , invariably @xmath75 with probability 1 and our stock price goes to 0 with probability 1 .",
    "so , holding a stock like this is a sure way to lose your money !      based on the foregoing , it is clear that , to avoid our stock losing its value in a long run , we must have @xmath76 .",
    "this translates into a lower bound on the drift @xmath77\\approx { \\sigma^2\\over 2}\\ ] ] where the last approximate equality holds for small @xmath65 .",
    "so , it makes little financial sense to hold a stock long term unless its drift @xmath23 exceeds the lower bound @xmath78 , despite the fact that on average the stock price goes up for any positive @xmath23 . this is because  on average \" is not the same as  most probably \"",
    "when we have a skewed probability distribution  which , in this case , is log - normal ( in the limit @xmath61 ) . put differently , the expected value ( [ exp.s ] ) is  misleading \" in the sense that it receives large contributions  owing to the exponential nature of @xmath79  from improbable paths .    in this regard , we can define  effective drift \" @xmath80 : @xmath81\\approx \\sigma\\mu\\ ] ] the meaning of @xmath82 is that it factors out the skewed nature of the probability distribution ( log - normal ) .",
    "looking at ( [ stock.exp ] ) , it is clear that asymptotically , when @xmath45 is large , most probable paths @xmath83 are around the deterministic  path \" @xmath84 with the subleading fluctuations @xmath85 ( assuming @xmath86 , which is the case , e.g. , if we have @xmath87 ) .      above we assumed that our stock pays no dividends .",
    "what is if does ?",
    "navely , applying the modigliani - miller theorem  or , rather , its part pertinent to dividends @xcite  it might appear that dividends should not affect our discussion above .",
    "the standard argument would be that if the stock pays dividends , if we reinvest them by purchasing more stock as dividends are paid , this is equivalent to the stock not paying dividends , so dividends should make no difference . however , there is a subtlety here when we consider the long - run value of our stock .",
    "thus , if we reinvest dividends , then it is indeed the case that the situation is exactly as though the stock does not pay dividends . in this case",
    "the long - run value of the stock is zero with probability 1 unless the drift @xmath88 , where @xmath23 is defined as above , irrespective of dividends .",
    "however , if we do no reinvest and instead deposit the dividends paid in a riskless savings account ( which we simply assume to pay no interest or incur any fees ) , then even if the stock price goes to zero in the long run , we still end up with some cash .",
    "let us quantify this based on our binary tree .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us assume that on each date @xmath45 , @xmath89 , the stock pays a dividend , which is a fixed fraction @xmath90 of the stock price .",
    "i.e. , each @xmath45 is an ex - dividend date .",
    "we can model our stock price via @xmath91^n s_0\\exp(\\sigma w_n)\\ ] ] the cumulative dividends @xmath92 received through the date @xmath45 are given by the sum @xmath93^{m-1 } s_0\\exp(\\sigma w_m)\\ ] ] we can readily compute the expected value @xmath94 .",
    "however , just as @xmath95 , @xmath94 is  misleading \" in the sense that it does not take into account the skewed nature of the probability distribution , i.e. , it does not correspond to the most probable paths .",
    "we can define an estimate @xmath96 of @xmath92 corresponding to most probable paths by simply substituting @xmath97 via @xmath98 in ( [ divs ] ) : @xmath99^{m-1 } s_0\\exp(\\sigma\\mu\\tau m ) = d\\exp(\\sigma\\mu\\tau)~ { { 1-\\exp(-\\eta\\tau n)}\\over{1-\\exp(-\\eta\\tau)}}~s_0\\ ] ] where @xmath100 let must be @xmath101 as @xmath61 to get the correct continuous dividend rate @xmath102 . ]",
    "then , in the limit where @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we have ( assuming @xmath106 ) : @xmath107 when @xmath108 ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) , we have @xmath110 $ ] , so , asymptotically , ",
    "most probably \" we ( approximately ) get our original investment @xmath20 back via dividend payments .",
    "when @xmath69 ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) , we get back a fraction of @xmath20 . and when @xmath112 ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) , we make money just from dividends .",
    "it is instructive to contrast this with the expected value @xmath114^{m-1 } s_0\\exp(\\nu\\tau m ) = d\\exp(\\nu\\tau)~ { { 1-\\exp(-\\xi\\tau n)}\\over{1-\\exp(-\\xi\\tau)}}~s_0\\approx { \\delta\\over{\\delta - \\nu}}~s_0\\ ] ] where @xmath115 the expected value @xmath94 is  misleading \" in the sense that it is higher than the estimate @xmath96 corresponding to most probable paths .",
    "the upshot is that dividends do make a difference if we do not reinvest them but stash the cash instead .",
    "this , again , is owing to the difference between  on average \" and  most probably \" . and maturity @xmath6 .",
    "under the black - scholes pricing model @xcite , the price of this option is @xmath116 . as @xmath74 , @xmath117 .",
    "so , despite the fact that the stock process under the risk - free probability measure ( which is used in computing the option price ) has a constant expectation @xmath118 ( in continuous time @xmath25 ) , the option to purchase the stock at price @xmath20 in the distant future is not zero ( the  nave \" answer ) but the full price @xmath20 . this is because under this risk - free measure the stock price goes to zero with probability 1 as @xmath74 . ]",
    "a short answer is :  everything ! \" consider a non - dividend stock .",
    "the nave thinking that so long as the drift @xmath119 we do not lose money long term because its expectation @xmath95 does not decrease is misguided . as we argue above , unless @xmath120",
    ", the most probable outcome is that the stock price will go to zero long term .",
    "i.e. , investing in a non - dividend stock makes little financial sense unless @xmath113 , or , equivalently , @xmath121 .",
    "so , where can this substantial drift in the stock price come from ?    throughout , here we assume a free market , where prices are determined by supply and demand .",
    "there are two sources of supply and demand : investors and the company that issued the stock itself . by ",
    "investors \" we broadly mean market participants , including companies other than the issuing company , which can affect the stock price via mergers and acquisitions , tender offers , etc . the investors can increase the price of the stock by purchasing shares , or lower it by selling or shorting shares .",
    "the issuing company can lower the price of its stock by floating more shares , or increase it via , e.g. , buybacks .",
    "if the issuing company does nothing of the kind , i.e. , does not offer or purchase shares , then the price is set by the investors .",
    "the investors may or may not be rational , and may or may not base their decisions on valuations using the company s realized and projected earnings . either way , since no cash is flowing from the company into the stock , i.e. , since the company is not using its earnings to affect the stock price directly via , e.g. , buybacks , the price and any drift are based purely on the investors perception and interpretation of the information about the company s earnings and other possibly pertinent information .    now , unless @xmath122 , the likely long - run price of the stock is zero .",
    "so , assuming no dividends , buybacks , etc . ,",
    "if @xmath123 , we have a bubble . in plain english , investors are holding cut paper .",
    "in fact , it is worse .",
    "it has all the elements of a ponzi scheme . and",
    "this applies even if @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , since the issuing company does not reward the investors by returning money to them in any way , shape or form , the current investors hopes for any future gains are solely based on the future investors continuing the current investors perception and interpretation of the earnings , etc .",
    "so , unless @xmath122 , we have a bubble . and , absent any cash inflow into the stock from the issuing company , it is the investors who must pony up the  premium \" @xmath78 in the drift @xmath23 , which  premium \" is solely due to the stock s riskiness .",
    "let @xmath124 stocks with the expected value of @xmath125 are to be avoided ( or even shorted ) .",
    "the higher the expected value of @xmath30 , the safer the bet to invest into the stock .",
    "the ratio @xmath30 , which apparently has not been named in the finance context , is known as the market price of risk . when properly normalized ( it has the dimension of @xmath126 ) , it coincides with the sharpe / information ratio . ] is dimensionless .",
    "therefore , it is independent of the time scale based on which it is computed .",
    "it is instructive to look at some empirical properties of the ratio @xmath30 for equities , including any explanatory variables that may have statistically significant contributions into it .",
    "for longer horizons , one may expect , e.g. , price - to - book ratio ( p / b ) to contribute to it . here our intent is not to do an exhaustive empirical study on various time horizons .",
    "instead , we simply discuss an illustrative example .",
    "we take pricing data ( closing prices fully adjusted for splits and dividends ) from 2014 - 03 - 18 to 2015 - 06 - 30 ( both inclusive , total of 325 trading days ) for u.s .",
    "listed common stocks and class shares ( no otcs , preferred shares , etc . ) with no nas in closing prices , market cap data , and bics ( bloomberg industry classification system ) sector assignments as of 2015 - 06 - 30 , and no nas in the market cap data as of 2014 - 03 - 18 .",
    "this universe contains 4416 tickers .",
    "based on this data we compute the time series of daily close - to - close returns @xmath127 , an @xmath128 matrix , where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",

    "thus , @xmath134 where the mean and variance are serial .",
    "are automatically  time - ordered \" . ] alternatively , instead of @xmath127 , we can use cross - sectionally demeaned returns @xmath135 in ( [ calc.mu ] ) and ( [ calc.var ] ) .",
    "i.e. , here we take returns w.r.t . to an equally weighted  market \"",
    "yet another choice ( out of myriad others ) is to use returns w.r.t . a log - cap weighted ",
    "market \" benchmark : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the market cap as of 2014 - 03 - 2018 , so it is out - of - sample .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table.kappa ] , where for comparison purposes ( and keeping in mind  shortcomings \" of cap weighted benchmarks ) we also give the results for @xmath133 computed based on @xmath138 defined as in ( [ r.hat ] ) but with @xmath139 replaced by @xmath137 , i.e. , these are returns w.r.t .",
    "a cap weighted  market \" benchmark .",
    "coincidentally , the mean value of @xmath133 based on  vanilla \" returns @xmath127 came out close to 1 in this particular sample .",
    "so , the values of @xmath133 are mostly of order 1 .",
    "what do they depend on ?",
    "one good guess is that log of market cap should be a good explanatory variable . as mentioned above , another explanatory variable one",
    "might be tempted to try is p / b ( or its log ) ; however , it turns out to be a poor predictor of @xmath133 . on the other hand ,",

    "the book data is as of 2014 - 03 - 18 , and has no nas for our universe of 4416 stocks .",
    "however , 80 tickers have 0 book value , and 159 tickers have negative book value .",
    "we exclude such tickers from our regressions below ( so we can take log of p / b ) .. ] the regression results are summarized in tables [ table.reg.cap.pb ] and [ table.reg.cap.sec.pb ] , which unequivocally suggest that p / b is not a good predictor of @xmath133 , at least on the time horizon tested ( roughly , 5 calendar quarters ) . on the other hand , market cap and",

    "so , in the finance context @xmath191 must have some other interpretation . as we will see",
    ", it does indeed .",
    "a more  disconcerting \" feature of the uncertainty principle ( [ xv.comm ] ) may appear to be that in finance we are not accustomed to thinking about things in terms of operators .",
    "thus , in continuous time , we have real - valued processes such as a brownian motion @xmath32 .",
    "so , why would things not commute ?",
    "the answer is neat and stems from how the commutation relation ( [ xv.comm ] ) is interpreted in ( euclidean ) quantum mechanics ( including how operators are defined in the financial context ) .",
    "it is all about _",
    "time ordering_. the operators in ( [ xv.comm ] ) are acting on a space of some functions . and",
    "for two operator @xmath192 and @xmath193 , the product @xmath194 is understood as being time - ordered : @xmath195 i.e. , the operator acting first is _ always _ in the past w.r.t .",

    "we also need to define the velocity @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient ( albeit not critical ) to define it at the midpoint : @xmath199",
    "so , according to our time - ordering prescription , we need to evaluate @xmath200 more precisely , we need to evaluate the _ expectation _ of this expression : recall that @xmath201 with probability @xmath48 and @xmath202 with probability @xmath50 ( see section [ sec2 ] ) . therefore , the expectation of ( [ wv ] ) is simply . recall that @xmath203 $ ] . ]",

    "this is just as well . in continuous time",
    "we identify @xmath31 with the brownian motion process @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is identified with white noise @xmath34 .",
    "the latter has infinite variance , hence the uncertainty principle ( [ xv.comm.fin ] )  in finance .",
    "we can readily construct the velocity operator @xmath208 in the coordinate representation @xmath171 : @xmath209 its eigenfunctions ( which are _ not _ wavefunctions  see below ) are of the form @xmath210 where @xmath211 are the eigenvalues .",

    "when the velocity @xmath211 is fixed , the coordinate @xmath168 is completely undetermined , consistently with the uncertainty principle .",
    "on the other hand , if we localize our brownian motion near @xmath212 , which we can do by considering , e.g. , the laplace distribution @xmath213 then we have @xmath214 and the velocity is completely undetermined in the small @xmath215 limit , again , consistently with the uncertainty principle",
    ". intuitively , we can think about this as follows . if we put a brownian particle in a box and make the box smaller and smaller , both the direction and the magnitude of the velocity of the brownian particle become completely uncertain , same as for a ( euclidean time ) quantum mechanical particle .",
    "finally , let us mention that the above derivation of the uncertainty principle using a binary tree can be ported essentially unchanged into the path integral language ( see below ) .",
    "there , we also compute the path integral expectation of the commutator ( the l.h.s . of ( [ xv.comm.fin ] ) ) ,",
    "which is time - ordered inside the path integral . upon discretization of the path integral",
    ", we then follow the same procedure as above .      above we discuss the heisenberg uncertainty principle in the financial context in the form of the commutation relation ( [ xv.comm.fin ] ) .",
    "however , most people  at least non - physicists  associate the uncertainty principle with the inequality of the type ( [ unc.ineq ] ) , which follows from ( [ xp.comm ] ) in quantum mechanics .",
    "can we derive a similar inequality in the financial context starting from ( [ xv.comm.fin ] ) ?",
    "the answer is yes , but it is tricky",
    ".    it would be erroneous to assume that  in nave analogy with ( [ unc.ineq ] )  the answer is simply @xmath216 .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "first , in quantum mechanics ( [ unc.ineq ] ) is derived using the notion of the wavefunction .",
    "describes the probability amplitude , whereas its absolute value squared @xmath217 ( which is real - valued ) is the probability density and @xmath218 ( that is , for spatially localized configurations  for non - localized configurations , such as pure momentum states ( [ psi.p ] ) , things are a bit trickier ; however , for our purposes here we will not need to delve into such details ) .",
    "the expected value of a hermitian operator @xmath219 is then computed via @xmath220 , where @xmath219 is assumed to act to the right ( onto @xmath221 ) , and @xmath222 is the complex conjugate of @xmath221 .",
    "more generally , i.e. , not in the coordinate representation , a quantum state is described by a ket vector @xmath223 ( and its conjugate bra vector @xmath224 , with @xmath225 ) , and operator averages are computed via @xmath226 ( with @xmath219 acting to the right ) . for our purposes here , the coordinate representation suffices . ] as mentioned above , there are no wavefunctions in the financial context .",
    "second , in quantum mechanics the operators @xmath169 and @xmath170 are hermitian . in the financial context , they are not ( at least , @xmath208 is not in the coordinate representation  see above ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath166 and @xmath227 need to be _",
    "happily , we do not need wavefunctions to define @xmath166 and @xmath227 .",
    "let us stick to the coordinate representation .",
    "let us assume that we have a normalizable probability density @xmath228 for the values of @xmath168 , i.e. , @xmath229 that is , we have a localized configuration , and @xmath230 with finite @xmath231 . without loss of generality , we can set @xmath232 by shifting the origin .",
    "what about @xmath227 ?",
    "note that @xmath233 in ( [ laplace.den ] ) is one particular example of the density @xmath228 . as in ( [ v.laplace ] ) , we can define @xmath234 via @xmath235 therefore , recalling ( [ v.op ] ) , we have @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "now we can define @xmath239 note that the integrand in ( [ v _ * ] ) is a total derivative , so @xmath240 ( as @xmath241 ) .",

    "therefore , for the laplace density ( [ laplace.den ] ) , we have @xmath255 .",
    "on the other hand , if we take the gaussian density @xmath256 , we get @xmath257 , @xmath258 , so @xmath259 , and the inequality ( [ fin.ineq ] ) is saturated : @xmath260 . the necessary and sufficient condition for saturating the inequality in ( [ cs ] ) is @xmath261 , hence the gaussian distribution ( @xmath262 ) .      but wait ! what happened to the factor of @xmath263 on the r.h.s . in ( [ unc.ineq ] )",
    "we had in the context of quantum mechanics ? .",
    "] it is absent in ( [ fin.ineq ] ) .",
    "how come ? no wavefunctions !    in quantum mechanics we work with the wavefunctions @xmath221 , not probability densities @xmath228 .",
    "thus , we have ( @xmath264 , @xmath265 ) : @xmath266 where @xmath267 , and @xmath268 ( and we have integrated by parts in ( [ sig_p ] ) ) .    the first thing to note",
    "is that generally @xmath269 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath270 , where @xmath271 and @xmath272 are real .",
    "then @xmath273 so , the gradient in the phase @xmath272 generally yields nonzero average momentum .",
    "second , we still can apply the cauchy - schwartz inequality : @xmath274 a straightforward computation yields @xmath275 where the factor of @xmath263 stems from integrating by parts and using ( [ rho.norm ] ) . the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ aux ] ) is real , so we get the celebrated inequality @xmath276 the extra factor of @xmath263 on the r.h.s . of ( [ xp ] )",
    "arises because the normalization condition in quantum mechanics is ( [ rho.norm ] ) as opposed to ( [ norm ] ) . put differently , in quantum mechanics we deal with absolute values squared ( of complex wavefunctions ) in lieu of probability densities , whereas in finance we deal directly with probability densities .",
    "integration by parts then produces an extra factor of @xmath263 in quantum mechanics .",
    "in this note we discuss  in what is intended to be a pedagogical fashion  long - horizon effects of the combination of stock prices being i ) positive - definite and ii ) intrinsically volatile .",
    "in particular , it is misleading to forecast _ long - term _ behavior of stock prices by looking at their expected returns as  on average \" is _ not _ the same as  most probably \" , and the latter is what matters long - term .",
    "this all boils down to the fact that stock prices are not normally distributed but have skewed , long - tailed ( at the higher end ) distributions resulting in overly weighted contributions of improbable prices into the expected price thereby creating an illusory effect . in this regard",
    ", the highly skewed world of manhattan s real estate provides an apt analogy : looking at mean real estate prices is essentially useless as they are distorted by a relatively small number of   black swans \" , in the language of @xcite  high - end properties",
    ". a nice discussion of financial bubbles can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also discuss local ( short - horizon ) effects of volatility ( irrespective of positive - definiteness of prices ) , to wit , the analog of the uncertainty principle in finance .",
    "there have been prior works alluding to the uncertainty principle in the financial context ; however , these were mostly of collateral nature not directly relating to the simple map between a quantum mechanical particle and a brownian motion , with the exception of an appendix in the book @xcite , where the uncertainty principle is derived in a more complicated setting using the path integral formulation .",
    "here we use just a simple binary tree , albeit , as mentioned above , in the path integral formulation the actual computation at the final step , after going through the entire path integral machinery , is essentially the same as what we discuss herein .",
    "the advantages of our simple , binary tree based derivation are : i ) no need to complicate things with path integral ; and ii ) the connection to the brownian motion is explicit .",
