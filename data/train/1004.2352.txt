    "with the successful launch of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , we have a new opportunity to study the @xmath0-ray emission from different types of extragalactic sources  not only blazars , but also radio galaxies and possibly other classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn )  with much improved sensitivity than previously available ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) . during the initial all - sky survey performed during the first four months after its launch , the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) detected only two radio galaxies at high significance ( @xmath13 ) , namely ngc1275 ( abdo et al . 2009a",
    "; hereafter paper - i ) and cena ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b , 2009c ) .",
    "more recently , the detection of mev / gev emission from yet another famous radio galaxy m87 , an established tev source , was reported based on ten - months of all - sky survey _ fermi_-lat data ( abdo et al .",
    "2009d ) . yet",
    "the detection of ngc1275 was particularly noteworthy because this source , unlike cena or m87 , was previously undetected in @xmath0-rays , neither by _",
    "cgro_/egret during its @xmath1410 years of operation , nor by ground - based cherenkov telescopes . the @xmath0-ray flux of ngc1275 detected by the _ fermi_-lat was about seven times higher than the one implied by the @xmath15 upper limit reported by egret , namely @xmath16ph@xmath7s@xmath8 ( reimer et al .",
    "we note that _ cos b _ data taken between 1975 and 1979 ( strong et al . 1982 ; mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "1982 ) showed a @xmath0-ray excess coincident with the position of this galaxy , although the evidence for the claimed high - energy source to be _ uniquely _ related to ngc1275 is ambiguous .",
    "ngc1275 is a giant elliptical galaxy located at the center of the perseus cluster , luminosity distance @xmath17 mpc , scale @xmath18kpc arcmin@xmath8 ( for flat cosmology with @xmath19kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 and @xmath20 ) . ] .",
    "this cluster is the brightest cluster of galaxies in the x - ray band ( e.g. , bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ; fabian et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) , and as such it has been the focus of several extensive research programs over many years and across the entire available electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "when observed at radio wavelengths , ngc1275 hosts the exceptionally bright radio fri radio galaxy perseusa = 3c84 ( e.g. , vermeulen et al . 1994 , taylor et al .",
    "1996 , walker et al .",
    "2000 , asada et al .",
    "although high - energy @xmath0-rays may in general be produced within the intergalactic / interstellar medium of the perseus cluster , in paper - i , we argued that the inner radio jet of 3c84 was the most likely source of the observed @xmath0-ray photons because of the variability of the mev / gev flux on year / decade timescales implied by the egret and early _",
    "fermi_-lat observations . specifically , these measurements implied the @xmath0-ray emission region size in ngc1275 has a radius , @xmath21pc .",
    "note , however , that no significant variability was detected within the four - month long _",
    "fermi_-lat dataset analyzed in paper - i . also , the lat error circle determined from these initial data was too large to exclude possible contributions from other galaxies to the observed @xmath0-ray flux ( specifically , ngc  1273 , 1274 , 1277 , 1278 and 1279 , were still within the previously determined @xmath2 error circle with @xmath22arcmin ) .    meanwhile , follow - up observations by the veritas cherenkov telescope ( weekes et al .",
    "2002 ) put strong constraints on the very high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emission from ngc1275 above 100 gev .",
    "in particular , no vhe @xmath0-ray emission from ngc1275 was detected by veritas , with a @xmath23 confidence level upper limit of @xmath24 of the crab nebula flux , corresponding to @xmath25 of the power - law extrapolation of the mev / gev flux observed during the first four months of the _ fermi_-lat observations ( assuming the photon index , @xmath26 ; acciari et al .",
    "this naturally indicates a deviation from the pure power - law spectrum in the vhe regime , possibly compatible with the presence of an exponential cutoff around or below photon energies @xmath27gev ( acciari et al .",
    "the magic cherenkov telescope also recently measured upper limits for the vhe @xmath0-ray emission of ngc1275 , namely @xmath28ph@xmath7s@xmath8 for the photon indices ranging from @xmath29 up to @xmath30 ( aleksi et al .",
    "thus , the implied deviation in the @xmath0-ray spectrum of 3c84 from a simple power - law form , as well as a possibility for a short - timescale ( @xmath31 month ) variability of the perseusa @xmath0-ray flux , may now be finally addressed and re - examined by _",
    "fermi_-lat , due to the much improved photon statistic ( especially above @xmath32gev ) after the one - year - all - sky survey",
    ". obviously , such deep studies of ngc1275 in the mev / gev photon energy range are of the major importance for understanding the whole class of @xmath0-ray emitting radio galaxies in general .",
    "firmly motivated , we performed a detailed investigation of ngc1275 in @xmath0-rays based on the accumulation of one - year of _ fermi_-lat all - sky survey data .",
    "in particular , we aimed to address the following problems : ( i ) presence of short - timescale @xmath0-ray flux variability , ( ii ) positional coincidence of the @xmath0-ray emitting center with the active nucleus of ngc1275 , and ( iii ) spectral curvature and spectral evolution of ngc1275 in the mev / gev photon energy range . in @xmath332 , we describe the _ fermi_-lat @xmath0-ray observations and data reduction procedure .",
    "the results of the analysis are given in @xmath333 , and the discussion and conclusions are presented in @xmath334 .",
    "the lat instrument onboard _ fermi _ is described in detail in atwood et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and references therein .",
    "compared to earlier @xmath0-ray missions , the lat has a large effective area ( @xmath14@xmath34@xmath35 on axis at @xmath36gev for the event class considered here ) , wide energy coverage ( from @xmath37mev to @xmath38gev ) , and improved angular resolution .",
    "the @xmath39 containment angles of the reconstructed incoming photon direction are approximated as @xmath40 below @xmath32gev , giving @xmath41 at @xmath42mev and @xmath43 at @xmath32gev ( update of values presented in atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) . above @xmath32gev ,",
    "the improvement of angular resolution becomes relatively gentle , such that @xmath44 at @xmath42gev . during the first year of operations , most of the telescope s time was dedicated to observing in `` survey mode '' where _ fermi _ points away from the earth and nominally rocks the spacecraft axis north and south from the orbital plane to enable monitoring of the entire sky on a time scale shorter than a day .",
    "the whole sky is surveyed every @xmath45hours ( or 2 orbits ) .",
    "the total live time included is 280.3 days ( 24.21 ms ) .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute efficiency of 75.0 @xmath46 .",
    "most of the inefficiency is due to time lost during passages through the south atlantic anomaly and to readout dead time .",
    "the observations used here comprises all scientific data obtained between 4 august 2008 and 13 august 2009 .",
    "this time interval runs from mission elapsed time ( met ) 239557417 to 271844550 .",
    "we have applied the zenith angle cut of @xmath47 to eliminate photons from the earth s limb .",
    "the same zenith cut is also accounted for in the exposure calculation using the lat science tool gtltcube .",
    "we use the `` diffuse '' class events ( atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are those reconstructed events having the highest probability of being photons . in the analysis presented here",
    ", we set the lower energy bound to a value of @xmath42mev .",
    "science tools version v9r15p2 and irfs ( instrumental response functions ) p6_v3 ( a model of the spatial distribution of photon events calibrated post - launch ) were used throughout this paper .",
    "the early portion of the data here coincides with the early lat observations of ngc1275 presented in paper - i ( 4 august 2008 and 5 december 2008 ) .",
    "figure1 shows the lat @xmath2 @xmath0-ray localization error circles placed on the _ chandra _ acis - s x - ray image of ngc1275/perseus region ( obsid 4952 ; exposure @xmath48ks ) .",
    "image is constructed between @xmath49 and @xmath50kev .",
    "the positional center of the @xmath0-ray emission ( ra@xmath51 , dec@xmath52 ) is taken from the 11-month catalog ( 1fgl  j0319.7 + 4130 ; abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) , and is only @xmath1arcmin from the ngc1275 nucleus ( ra@xmath53 , dec@xmath54 ) , with @xmath2 radius @xmath3arcmin ( fig .",
    "1 ) . since the localization error has been substantially improved compared to the one quoted in paper - i ( @xmath55arcmin , based on the 3-month bright source list ; abdo et al.2009c ) , all the other field galaxies mentioned in paper  i within the 3-month lat error ( ngc  1273 , 1274 , 1277 , 1278 , and 1279 ) are now outside the 11-month lat error circle . indeed",
    ", even the nearest galaxy , ngc  1274 , is 2.6 arcmin apart from the positional center of the @xmath0-ray emission with 95 @xmath46 radius of 1.5 arcmin . with the good positional association described above ,",
    "we thus believe the @xmath0-ray source is most likely identified as the nucleus of ngc  1275 , but still needing further confirmation based on correlated variability with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "we also checked the projection of the @xmath0-ray images as presented in paper - i .",
    "the counts distributions of ngc1275 in different energy bands are consistent with the distributions for a point source , indicating that the diffuse extended component does not contaminate the ngc1275/perseus @xmath0-ray source , even with much improved photon statistics in the one - year dataset .",
    "since the angular resolution of the lat improves at high energies ( atwood et al .",
    "2009 and see above ) , it is interesting to compare the reconstructed incoming photon directions with the position of the ngc1275 nucleus around the higher energy photons that can be detected with the _ fermi_-lat",
    ". figure2 shows the angular separation of @xmath56gev photons from the nucleus of ngc1275 as a function of photon energy .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath2 angular resolutions of _",
    "fermi_-lat are shown as dotted and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the angular displacement of the highest energy photon detected during one - year - all - sky survey ( @xmath57gev ; a double circle with a number `` i '' in figure2 ) from the nucleus is only @xmath12arcmin , which is well within the psf of the lat at this energy ( @xmath58arcmin ) .",
    "note that the chance probability for detecting galactic and/or extragalactic @xmath0-ray background photons with energies at least @xmath59gev within @xmath60 is less than @xmath61 , hence we conclude that ngc1275 is the most likely source of the discussed photon .",
    "the other three highest energy photons ( @xmath62gev ) are marked in figure2 as `` ii '' , `` iii '' and `` iv '' , and are all well within the @xmath2 psf of the _ fermi_-lat .",
    "to study the average spectrum of ngc1275 during the one - year observation , we use the standard maximum - likelihood spectral estimator provided with the lat science tools gtlike .",
    "this fits the data to a source model , along with the models for the uniform extragalactic and structured galactic backgrounds .",
    "we use a recent galactic diffuse model , gll_iem_v02.fit , with the normalization free to vary in the fit .",
    "the response function used is p6_v3_diffuse .",
    "careful choice of the source region is important especially for relatively faint sources . following the detailed study of changing the region of interest ( roi ) radius from @xmath63 to @xmath64 in paper - i , we set @xmath65 in the following analysis to minimize the contamination from the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "only one point source , corresponding to src_a in paper - i , was found in the roi .",
    "the coordinates are ra@xmath66 , dec@xmath67 , with @xmath68arcmin .",
    "we modeled the source for subsequent spectral analysis ( also see the _",
    "fermi_-lat bright @xmath0-ray source list ; abdo et al .",
    "2009c ) .    we",
    "first model the continuum @xmath0-ray emission of ngc1275 with a single power - law .",
    "the extragalactic background is assumed to have a power - law spectrum as well , with the spectral index and the normalization free to vary in the fit . from an unbinned gtlike analysis ,",
    "the best fit power - law parameters for ngc1275 are :    @xmath69    or    @xmath70    with only statistical errors taken into account .",
    "systematic errors for the lat are still under investigation , but the estimated systematic uncertainty on the flux is 10 @xmath46 at 100 mev , 5 @xmath46 at 500 mev , and 20 @xmath46 at 10 gev , respectively ( abdo et al .",
    "the results are consistent with those presented in paper - i , even though the uncertainties are now much smaller due to the improved photon statistics .",
    "the predicted photon counts from ngc1275 in the roi are @xmath71 and the test statistic ( defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the likelihood when the source is included or not , respectively ) is @xmath75 above @xmath76mev , corresponding to a @xmath77 detection . for the galactic diffuse background , the normalization is @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "indeed , a @xmath95 fit of the power - law model to the data fitting to the resultant 10 band lat spectrum as described above , to give a convenient estimate of the goodness of the fit . ]",
    "gives a relatively poor fit with @xmath96 for @xmath97 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , where its probability is @xmath98 .",
    "instead , an alternative fit with a cutoff power - law function with the form @xmath99 $ ] gives a much better representation of the data with an improved @xmath100 for @xmath97d.o.f . , corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "we therefore retried the gtlike fit assuming a power - law with an exponential cutoff function , and obtained @xmath102gev with @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we apply a likelihood ratio test between a simple power - law and a cutoff power - law function .",
    "the test statistic ( @xmath104 ) is twice the difference in these log - likelihoods , which gives @xmath104 = 2.9 for our case .",
    "note that the probability distribution of the test statistic can be approximated by a @xmath95 distribution with 1 d.o.f .",
    ", corresponding to different d.o.f . between two functions .",
    "we obtain @xmath105 @xmath106 0.08 , which again indicates a deviation from a simple power - law function although this is currently inconclusive .",
    "the best - fit cutoff power - law function is shown as dotted line in figure3 .",
    "next , we investigated the @xmath0-ray flux variations of ngc1275 from 4 august 2008 to 13 august 2009 . to this end , we constructed spectra with a time resolution of 14 days and fit each spectrum with a power - law model just for simplicity .",
    "the roi radius ( @xmath65 ) , the energy range ( @xmath107mev ) , and other screening conditions are the same as described above . since no variability is expected for the underlying background diffuse emission , we fix the best - fit parameters to the average values determined from the one - year integrated spectrum for the galactic and extragalactic background components .",
    "we first fix the spectral index to the best fit value over the full interval , @xmath108 , to minimize uncertainties in the flux estimates . in this case ,",
    "variability is highly significant with @xmath109 for @xmath110d.o.f .",
    ", where @xmath111 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0-ray flux varies even within a few month timescale . due to the limited photon statistics , however , it is difficult to investigate any shorter timescale variability of ngc1275 .",
    "we also investigate the spectral evolution of ngc1275 , with the @xmath0-ray photon index free to vary .",
    "figure4 shows variations of the flux ( @xmath107mev : _ upper panel _ ) and photon index ( _ lower panel _ ) versus time .",
    "a flaring event is seen around @xmath112days after 2008 august 4th ( epoch `` b '' in figure4 ) , corresponding to the epoch april  may 2009 .",
    "a doubling timescale for the flaring period can not be accurately measured , but @xmath1420 days .",
    "a @xmath95 fit to a constant gives @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath110d.o.f .",
    ", corresponding to the probability @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , for the flux and the photon index variations .",
    "interestingly , the spectral variation is predominantly due to the difference between the pre- and post - flare period , denoted in figure4 as epochs `` a '' and `` c '' . in fact , if we test the variability _ separately _ for the pre- and post - flare periods ( a and c ) , the significance of the variability decreases substantially , such that a constant fit provides @xmath117 or @xmath118 for both the flux and the photon index changes . during the flare ( epoch b ) , the photon index changes from @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "note that , after the flare ( epoch c ) , the flux drops to its original level but the spectrum remains relatively flat , with @xmath121 , persisting for more than a few months .",
    "it should also be noted that three out of the four highest energy photons ( denoted as i , ii , and iii in figure2 ) were indeed detected in the post - flare period , when the spectrum appears the flattest .",
    "in the previous sections , we reported on the analysis of the @xmath0-ray emission from ngc1275 observed with _",
    "fermi_-lat during its one - year - all - sky survey .",
    "we showed that with the increased photon statistics , the positional center of the @xmath0-ray emission is now much closer to the ngc1275 nucleus as compared to that reported in paper - i .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the average @xmath0-ray spectrum of ngc1275 reveals a significant deviation from a simple power - law above photon energies @xmath122gev .",
    "that is , the observed _",
    "fermi_-lat spectrum is best fitted by a power - law function ( @xmath123 2.1 ) with an exponential cutoff at the break photon energy @xmath102gev .",
    "finally , we argued that significant flux and spectral changes of ngc1275 are detected with _",
    "fermi_-lat on a timescale of a few months , although the possibility for even shorter variability remains uncertain .",
    "we also reported the detection of an interesting spectral evolution , consisting of a _ persistent _ ( over more than a few months ) spectral hardening ( from @xmath124 to @xmath121 ) after the largest flaring event observed in april  may 2009 . during this flat - spectrum / low - flux - level epoch the highest energy photon ( @xmath125gev )",
    "was detected from the direction of ngc1275 .",
    "all these new findings basically support the idea put forward in paper - i that the observed @xmath0-ray emission from the perseus system originates in the ( sub ) pc - scale radio jet of ngc1275 , and is therefore most likely analogous to high - energy emission observed in blazars .",
    "in fact , as shown in paper - i , the overall @xmath126 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc1275 constructed with multi - frequency radio to @xmath0-ray data shows a close similarity to the `` two - bump '' seds of so - called low - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hereafter lbls ) .",
    "till now , only a few lbls have been detected at tev photon energies  bl lac ( albert et al .",
    "2007 ) , 3c66a ( acciari et al .",
    "2009a ) , s5 0716 + 714 ( anderhub et al .",
    "2009 ) , and also w  comae from an ibl class ( acciari et al . 2008 ; 2009d )  and more similar discoveries are expected .",
    "hence , ngc1275 itself has been suggested to be a potential tev source as well , thus motivating deep veritas ( acciari et al .",
    "2009b ) and magic ( aleksi et al .",
    "2010 ) observations .",
    "these observations so far resulted only in upper limits to the vhe @xmath0-ray emission of the studied region .",
    "one should note , however , that both the low- and high - energy peaks of ngc1275 ( in the @xmath126 representations ) are located at substantially lower frequencies than those of typical lbls .",
    "indeed , the low - energy ( synchrotron ) emission components of 3c66a and bl lac peak around @xmath127hz , while it is around @xmath128hz in the case of ngc1275 ( paper - i ) . correspondingly , the high - energy emission component of 3c66a ( but not necessarily of bl lac ) peaks at higher photon energies than that observed in ngc1275 .",
    "within such an interpretation , this is consistent with the softer mev / gev spectrum in ngc1275 ( @xmath129 ) compared to 3c66a ( @xmath130 ; abdo et al .",
    "2009b ) as measured by the _ fermi_-lat .",
    "note also that the x - ray spectrum of ngc1275 is clearly `` rising '' in the @xmath126 representation ( @xmath131 = 1.6@xmath1321.7 ; balmaverde et al .",
    "2006 , ajello et al .",
    "2009 ) , indicating that it is dominated by the low - energy portion of the ic emission , whilst the x - ray spectra of lbls are typically very flat , suggesting a transition between the synchrotron and ic components ( @xmath131 @xmath133 2 ; e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . such observational differences may indicate that , unlike in the case of lbls , the high - energy spectrum of ngc1275 does not extend up to tev photon energies .",
    "an interesting comparison can be made to another nearby radio galaxy detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat , namely m87 which resembles ngc1275 in many respects , and is an established tev source ( abdo et al .",
    "while m87 is closer to us than ngc1275 ( @xmath134mpc versus @xmath17mpc ) , the gev flux of m87 is much lower than that of ngc1275 ( @xmath135ph@xmath7s@xmath8 versus @xmath136ph@xmath7s@xmath8 ) , with similar lat measured spectra ( @xmath137 versus @xmath138 ) .",
    "note also that both radio galaxies are located at the centers of rich clusters , that the synchrotron emission components in both sources peak in the far infrared ( @xmath139hz ) , and the estimated jet powers are similar , @xmath140 erg s@xmath8 ( owen et al .",
    "2002 , dunn & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "thus , it may be surprising that only one of these has so far been detected at tev photon energies .",
    "the detailed analysis of the spectral evolution of ngc1275 within the _ fermi_-lat range reported in this paper may provide a viable explanation for such a behavior .",
    "in particular , as already emphasized above , we found that the epochs characterized by the flattest gev continuum of this source , as well as the arrival times of the highest energy photons from the direction of ngc1275 , do not coincide with the epochs of the highest photon flux above @xmath42mev .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure5 , which shows a correlation between @xmath141 and the photon indices emerging from the power - law fits . because no significant flux or spectral changes were observed during the pre- and post - flare epochs a ( @xmath142day ) and c ( @xmath143day ) ( see figure4 ) ,",
    "the average fluxes and photon indices for these time periods are reported .",
    "note that the average fluxes of these pre- and post - flare epochs are comparable , whilst the corresponding photon indices differ significantly by @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , the observed spectral evolution during one year of the _ fermi_-lat exposure reveals a hysteresis - like character , more clearly seen for the flaring period ( epoch b , with a time bin of 2 weeks ) , followed by a gradual flattening in the subsequent decay phase .",
    "further insights into the spectral evolution of ngc1275 within the _ fermi_-lat photon energy range are provided by figure6 , which shows the two seds for pre- and post - flare epochs a and c. here the dotted line corresponds to the best `` power - law with an exponential cutoff '' fit function determined from an average @xmath0-ray spectrum , as given in figure3 .",
    "interestingly , the difference between the two seds consists of an excess at photon energies @xmath145gev , with the low - energy @xmath0-ray flux remaining essentially unchanged between the two epochs .",
    "this implies that ( 1 ) the @xmath0-ray variability in ngc1275 ( and possibly other radio galaxies ) may be restricted to @xmath146gev photon energies , and that ( 2 ) the position of the peak in the high - energy spectral component ( in the @xmath147 representation ) may change substantially even within the same object with no accompanying significant flux changes .",
    "note in this context that both the veritas and magic non - detections were obtained during the pre - flare epoch a ( @xmath148day ; see acciari et al .",
    "2009b ; aleksi et al .",
    "hence , the emerging conclusion is that _ it is not the total flux above @xmath42mev which should play a major role in triggering tev observations of steep - spectrum _",
    "fermi_-lat sources , but instead it is the flux and photon index determined at higher photon energies ( @xmath146gev)_.    on the theoretical side , this conclusion could be possibly justified by noting that after a new episode of injection of freshly accelerated electrons into the emission zone ( e.g. , a downstream region of a shock ) , higher energy electrons may lag behind the lower - energy electrons . in such a case , as discussed previously in the context of blazar modeling ( e.g. , kirk et al . 1998 ; sato et al .",
    "2008 ) , an `` anti - clockwise '' hysteresis in the flux versus photon index plane may arise , similar to what we observed in ngc1275 at @xmath0-ray photon energies .    here ,",
    "we comment on the question if ngc1275  being a representative example of a low - power radio galaxy  may be considered as a misaligned blazar , most likely of the lbl type . assuming a homogeneous jet model",
    ", one should expect its jet doppler factor @xmath149 , for the typically expected jet viewing angle of @xmath150 and jet bulk lorentz factors @xmath151 .",
    "indeed , modeling of the broad - band emission of lbls ( beamed counterparts of radio galaxies such as ngc1275 by assumption ) requires @xmath152 . thus ,",
    "if the only difference between radio galaxies and blazars is due to the viewing angle , this should manifest in ( i ) different observed positions of the spectral peaks in the @xmath126 representation ( @xmath153 ) , ( ii ) different observed variability patterns ( @xmath154 , assuming the emission region is a moving source ) , and finally in ( iii ) different observed luminosities ( @xmath155 for a moving blob case , or @xmath156 for the steady jet ( see sikora et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "indeed , both the low- and high - energy @xmath126 peaks of ngc1275 are located at substantially lower frequencies than those of typical lbls .",
    "taking the difference of beaming factors into account ( i.e. , @xmath157 ) , the broad - band sed of the ngc1275 would be similar to the seds of blazars such as bl lacertae or 3c66a .",
    "note however that the position of the high - energy spectral peak may change substantially in a single object even for comparable flux levels , at least in ngc1275 , so the diagnostics related to the location of the spectral peaks may not be very conclusive .",
    "variability as short as day timescales is often observed in lbls .",
    "for example , during the historical flare of bl lacertae in 1997 , correlated @xmath0-ray and optical flares were observed , with the @xmath0-ray flux increasing by a factor of @xmath30 within a day ( bloom et al . 1997 ) .",
    "similarly , daily variability has been discovered in both _",
    "fermi_-lat and veritas observations of 3c66a ( reyes et al .",
    "hence , in the simple unification scheme outlined above , we should expect ngc1275 to vary in @xmath0-rays on timescales of several days .",
    "this , however , is difficult to test even with the excellent sensitivity of the _ fermi_-lat instrument , due to the limited photon statistics for weekly time bins .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper gives instead only a robust upper limit @xmath158 a few months .",
    "however , note that day - timescale variability has been detected at tev photon energy range for the m87 radio galaxy ( acciari et al .",
    "thus , more frequent monitoring of ngc1275 by ground - based cherenkov telescopes would be valuable in this respect .",
    "the observed photon flux of @xmath159ph@xmath7s@xmath8 implies an _ observed _ ( isotropic ) @xmath0-ray luminosity of ngc1275 , @xmath160ergs@xmath8 , for @xmath161 and @xmath162gev .",
    "this is already comparable to the typical observed @xmath0-ray luminosities of lbls , which range between @xmath163ergs@xmath8 .",
    "note in particular that in the framework of the simple unification scheme discussed above , the beamed analog of ngc1275 would then be characterized by the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity larger by a factor of @xmath164 ^ 4 \\sim 3 \\times 10 ^ 4 $ ] ( or at least @xmath165 ^ 3 \\sim 3 \\times 10 ^ 3 $ ] ) than this , i.e. @xmath166ergs@xmath8 . such luminosities are not expected for lbl - type blazars ( see abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity of ngc1275 is not energetically problematic , since the total _ emitted _ @xmath0-ray power in this source seems rather moderate _ as long as the emitting plasma moves with highly relativistic bulk velocities _ , namely @xmath167ergs@xmath8 for @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the solid angle defined by the jet opening angle @xmath170 , for which we assumed @xmath171 .",
    "such a relatively small emitted power would constitute less than @xmath172 of the total kinetic power of the ngc1275 jet , estimated by dunn & fabian ( 2004 ) to be roughly @xmath173ergs@xmath8 .",
    "yet the problem of an unexpectedly large observed @xmath0-ray luminosity of the beamed analog of ngc1275 remains , and poses a serious challenge to the simplest version of the agn unification scheme . in this context , a viable explanation for this problem would be to postulate that the high - energy emission observed from `` misaligned '' blazars such as ngc1275 ( or m87 ) is dominated not by a jet `` spine '' characterized by large bulk lorentz factors ( @xmath174 as is the case in bona - fide blazars ) , but by the slower jet boundary layers ( @xmath175 few ) as discussed by several authors ( e.g. , celotti et al .",
    "2001 , stawarz & ostrowski 2002 , ghisellini et al .",
    "alternatively , one may propose that the @xmath0-ray emission observed from radio galaxies is not produced within the `` proper '' blazar emission zone , but at larger distances from the active center characterized by slower bulk velocities ( say , @xmath176 few ) of the emitting plasma .",
    "yet another possibility may be that the inner jets in ngc1275 ( and also in similar objects ) are in general intrinsically less relativistic than the ones in bona - fide blazars ; this would be consistent with the conclusions of lister & marscher ( 1997 ) , who argue that radio - loud agn with nuclear jets characterized by @xmath177 must be rather rare among the general population .",
    "whichever scenario is correct , the _ fermi _ results seem to indicate that low - power radio galaxies are most likely not simple off - axis analogs of bl lac objects in terms of their @xmath0-ray properties .",
