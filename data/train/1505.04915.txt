    "the notion of a _ diffeological structure _ , or simply _ diffeology _ , due to j.m .",
    "souriau @xcite , appeared in differential geometry as part of the quest to generalize the notion of a smooth manifold in a way that would yield a category closed under the main topological constructions yet carrying sufficient geometric information . to be more precise ,",
    "it is well - known that the category of smooth manifolds , while being the main object of study in differential geometry , is not closed under some of the basic topological constructions , such as taking quotients or function spaces , nor does it include objects which in recent years attracted much attention both from geometers and mathematical physicists , such as irrational tori , orbifolds , spaces of connections on principal bundles in yang - mills field theory , to name just a few .",
    "many fruitful attempts , some of which are summarized in @xcite , had been made to address these issues , notably in the realm of functional analysis and noncommutative geometry , via smooth structures  la sikorski or  la frlicher ; each of these attempts however had its own limitations , be that the sometimes exaggerated technical complexity or missing certain topological situations ( such as singular quotients , missing from sikorski s and frlicher s spaces ) .    the diffeology , whose birth story is beautifully described in the preface and afterword of the excellent book @xcite , has the advantage of being possibly the least technical ( and therefore very easy to work with ) and , much more importantly , very wide in scope .",
    "indeed , the category of diffeological spaces contains , on one hand , smooth manifolds as a full subcategory , and is very well - behaved on the other : in particular , it is complete , cocomplete and cartesian closed ( see , for example , theorems 2.5 and 2.6 in @xcite ) .    as for diffeological groups , they were in fact the context in which the notion of diffeology was introduced ; the very titles of the already mentioned foundational papers by souriau are witnesses to this fact .",
    "more precisely , the historical origin of the concept of `` diffeology '' was , as evidenced by iglesias - zemmour s fascinating account of those events in @xcite , souriau s attempt to regard some types of coadjoint orbits of infinite dimensional groups of diffeomorphisms as lie groups , and to do so in `` the simplest possible manner '' . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned in chapter 7 of @xcite , the theory of diffeological groups has not yet been much developed .",

    "regular_. the meaning of the latter is this : we fix an integer @xmath0 and consider an infinite tree with precisely one vertex of valence @xmath1 ( this is the root ) and all other vertices of valence @xmath2 .",
    "such an object is a very natural venue for applying the notion of diffeology : on one hand , it is a topological space quite different from a ( one - dimensional ) manifold , since it contains an infinite ( albeit discrete ) set of points whose local neighbourhood is a cone over at least three points , and on the other hand , there is a natural diffeological structure to put on it , the so - called `` wire diffeology '' ( see below ) .",
    "this fact in itself raises a number of questions , for reasons of intellectual curiosity at least if nothing else , such as , will the _ d - topology _ be different or equal to the standard topology of the tree ?",
    "now , groups of automorphisms of such a tree , even restricted to a rather specific construction such as the one we will deal with ( which is however independently interesting from the algebraic point of view , see the foundational paper @xcite ) are easily seen to be groups of diffeomorphisms of the tree with respect to the above diffeological structure .",
    "the category of diffeological spaces being closed under taking groups of diffeomorphisms , they become in the end diffeological groups ; and since they are also topological groups with respect to , for instance , profinite topology ( but occasionally there are some others , see , for instance , @xcite ) , the same questions about comparing the two topologies arise ... and going further still , the question becomes , _ what kind of information about these groups can we obtain if we regard them as diffeological groups ? _    [ [ the - content ] ] the content + + + + + + + + + + +    the first two sections are devoted to recalling some of the main definitions and constructions related to , respectively , diffeological spaces and ( certain kind of ) groups of automorphisms of regular rooted trees ; they gather together everything that is used henceforth , _",

    "the first of these two deals with the choice of the diffeology to put on the tree , showing in the end that the topology corresponding to the final choice ( the so - called d - topology ) is indeed the one coinciding with that of the tree in the usual sense .",
    "the last section is devoted to the functional diffeology on the whole group of tree automorphisms , showing that ( for reasons that apply actually to any subgroup of this group ) the functional diffeology is the discrete one ; a finding that is not surprising in view of the discrete nature of these groups that had originated as so - called _ automata groups _",

    "recall that by the definition of d - topology a set @xmath134 is d - open if and only if for any plot @xmath135 the pre - image @xmath136 is open in @xmath7 ; now , by construction and by the definition of the generated diffeology this is equivalent to @xmath137 being open in @xmath133 for any @xmath138 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath70 is d - open if and only if it is open in @xmath81 in the usual sense .",
    "suppose first that @xmath70 is open .",
    "then its pre - image with respect to any @xmath139 is open in @xmath133 because @xmath139 is continuous ; therefore it is d - open by the very definition of d - openness .",
    "now suppose that @xmath70 is a d - open set ; we need to show that it is also open in the usual sense .",
    "to do so , it is sufficient to show that for any point of @xmath70 the latter contains its open neighbourhood",
    ". choose such an arbitrary point @xmath140 ; we consider two cases .",
    "suppose first that @xmath101 belongs to the interior of some edge @xmath141 .",
    "set @xmath142 , and let @xmath138 ; we can assume that its image contains @xmath141 .",
    "note that since @xmath139 is injective , we have @xmath143 ; both of these two sets are open in @xmath133 , the first because @xmath70 is d - open and the second because it is the pre - image of an open set under the continuous map @xmath139 .",
    "this implies that @xmath137 is open in @xmath133 , therefore @xmath4 is open in the image of @xmath139 , the latter being a homeomorphism with its image , and it is open in @xmath144 , hence it is open in @xmath81 as well .",
    "thus , @xmath4 is an open neighbourhood of @xmath101 contained in @xmath70 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath101 is a vertex ( we can assume that it is not the root ; the proof changes only formally for the latter ) .",
    "let @xmath145 be the edges incident to @xmath101 .",
    "for each @xmath146 let @xmath147 ; set @xmath148    we need to show that @xmath4 is open in @xmath81 . for each @xmath149 choose a map @xmath150 such that its image contains @xmath151 . then @xmath152",
    "; both of these sets are open in @xmath133 , by the d - openness of @xmath70 and by continuity of @xmath139 .",
    "hence @xmath153 is open in @xmath133 and , @xmath150 being a homeomorphism with its image , the set @xmath154 is open in @xmath151 .",
    "it follows that @xmath4 is open in @xmath155 and therefore it is open in @xmath81 ; thus , it is an open nieghbourhood of @xmath101 contained in @xmath70 , and this concludes the proof .",
    "in this section we consider @xmath81 endowed with the embedded wire diffeology described in the previous section .",
    "we must first ensure that the elements of @xmath89 are smooth maps with respect to this diffeology ; this then gives rise to the functional diffeology on @xmath89 and to the _ a priori _ finer diffeology that makes @xmath89 into a diffeological group and is the finest one with such property .      in this section",
    "we first make some observations regarding the plots of the functional diffeology on @xmath89 ; as a preliminary , we need to show that such diffeology is indeed well - defined , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the elements of @xmath89 are indeed diffeomorphisms . we then proceed to consider the d - topology underlying the functional diffeology of @xmath89 .          by definition of a generated diffeology and",
    "that of a smooth map it is sufficient to show that for any given injective and both ways continuous map @xmath158 the composition @xmath159 is again injective and both ways continuous .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath160 is an automorphism of @xmath81 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is a homeomorphism of @xmath81 considered with its usual topology ; as we have already established that the d - topology of @xmath81 coincides with the usual one , this proves the claim .      in the arguments that follow ,",
    "we will make use of the following family of plots of @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath161 be an infinite path in @xmath81 ; let @xmath162 be the vertex of the smallest length .",
    "for each @xmath161 we fix a homeomorphism @xmath163 such that @xmath164 obviously , every @xmath139 is a plot for the diffeology @xmath126 .",
    "we denote the set of maps @xmath139 , associated to all possible @xmath165 , by @xmath166 we denote by @xmath167 the subset of @xmath168 consisting of all those maps whose image contains the root .      * for any given @xmath170 , its image @xmath171 is a vertex if and only if @xmath172 ; * in particular , the restriction of @xmath139 on any interval of form @xmath173 is a homeomorphism with the interior of some edge of @xmath81 .",
    "since the d - topology is defined by smooth curves ( as mentioned in the first section , see @xcite ) , we first establish the following characterization of those plots of the functional diffeology on @xmath89 that are curves .",
    "let @xmath174 be a plot for the functional diffeology on @xmath89 .",
    "then for all @xmath175 the automorphisms @xmath176 , @xmath177 belong to the same coset of @xmath178 , and the automorphisms @xmath179 , @xmath180 belong to the same coset of @xmath181 .",
    "recall that by proposition [ criterio - funct - diff ] @xmath1 is a plot if and only if the map @xmath182 given by @xmath183 is smooth .",
    "the latter condition implies , in particular , that for any smooth map @xmath184 and for any injective two ways continuous map @xmath158 the composition @xmath185 is a plot of @xmath81 , _",
    "i.e. _ , that ( at least locally ) it is the composition @xmath186 , of some smooth map @xmath187 and some injective two ways continuous @xmath188 . in particular , the map @xmath189 is a continuous map in the usual sense .",
    "let us now fix a positive integer @xmath76 , a vertex @xmath90 of length @xmath76 , and a vertex @xmath190 of length @xmath191 adjacent to @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath192 be such that @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "by definition of @xmath195 we have that @xmath196 @xmath197    we claim that @xmath198 and @xmath199 are adjacent vertices . that they are vertices , of which the first is has length @xmath76 and the second one has length @xmath191 , is obvious , since @xmath1 takes values in @xmath89 , all of whose elements send vertices to vertices preserving their length .",
    "it suffices to show that they are adjacent , _",
    "i.e. _ , joined by an edge .",
    "as we have already observed , the map @xmath200 is continuous in the usual sense , so it suffices to show that the image of the interval @xmath173 under it does not contain vertices .",
    "indeed , by its definition @xmath200 writes as @xmath201 ; we first observe that this image is a vertex if and only if @xmath171 is a vertex ( this is because @xmath202 ) , then , second , @xmath171 is a vertex if and only if @xmath172 ( this is by choice of @xmath139 ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath203 then @xmath201 belongs to the interior of some edge , and precisely , the edge that joins @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "it remains to observe that @xmath199 is adjacent to a unique vertex of length @xmath76 ; since @xmath90 and @xmath190 are adjacent , @xmath90 has length @xmath76 , and @xmath177 is an automorphism , this vertex is @xmath204 . on the other hand , @xmath198 has length @xmath76 , and we have just shown that it is adjacent to @xmath199 ; we conclude that @xmath205 finally , since @xmath90 is arbitrary , we can conclude that @xmath206 , as claimed ; and since @xmath76 is arbitrary , this proves the entire statement .",
    "note that we phrase this statement in terms of the congruence topology on @xmath89 , and not in those of the profinite topology , which for @xmath89 does coincide with the congruence one .",
    "this is to highlight the relation of this statement for examples such as the group @xmath209 , for which the two topologies are different ; although we will see shortly a fact that renders the difference insignificant .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath210 for all @xmath211 ; as in the previous proof , this is equivalent to having @xmath212 for any vertex @xmath90 of length @xmath76 .",
    "choose such a vertex , and fix a map @xmath192 such that @xmath193 .",
    "as we have established in the proof of the previous proposition , @xmath213 belongs to the subtree @xmath214 . by the same reasoning ,",
    "applied to @xmath191 , the vertex @xmath215 belongs to the subtree @xmath216 .",
    "now , since @xmath217 by choice of @xmath139 , each vertex of length @xmath218 belongs to a unique subtree @xmath86 with @xmath219 , and @xmath220 is an automorphism , we can conclude that @xmath221 , and the corollary follows by the now obvious induction on @xmath222 .",
    "recall that by proposition [ criterio - funct - diff ] @xmath1 is a plot if and only if the map @xmath223 given by @xmath224 is smooth .",
    "now , by definition @xmath225 is smooth if and only if for any plot @xmath226 the composition @xmath227 is again a plot of @xmath81 .",
    "let us fix and arbitrary vertex @xmath90 of @xmath81 , and let us take , as the plot @xmath228 , the following map : @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the constant map acting by @xmath231 .",
    "then @xmath232 observe now that @xmath233 is an automorphism of @xmath81 for all @xmath101 , and so sends vertices to vertices ; therefore the image of the map @xmath234 is a set of vertices of @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , it is a discrete subset of @xmath81 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath234 is a plot of @xmath81 ; as such , it is either a constant map or it filters through an injective continuous map @xmath118 via a smooth map @xmath235 . in this latter case",
    "it must a continuous map defined on a connected set and so can not have a discrete set with more than one point as its image .",
    "it remains to conclude that @xmath234 is a constant map , which means that @xmath236 does not depend on @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath90 is arbitrary , this implies that @xmath1 is a constant map , as is claimed .",
    "moreover , we consider the proof of proposition [ d - top : discrete : prop ] , we see that the plot @xmath1 under consideration being defined on @xmath133 rather than an arbitrary domain @xmath237 was not significant ; it would hold just the same writing @xmath7 in place of @xmath133 and @xmath238 in place of @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that _ all _ plots of the functional diffeology of @xmath89 are constant maps , and therefore this diffeology is indeed discrete .",

    "we have already established that the latter is discrete and therefore is the finest possible diffeology on @xmath89 ( see @xcite , section 1.20 ) . for this reason it coincides with the diffeological group structure , the latter being _ a priori _ finer than the functional diffeology .",
