    "in a previous paper @xcite , we derived a formula for estimating the eccentricity of the inner binary of a hierarchical triple system with well separated components and initially circular orbits .",
    "however , the derivation was based on the assumption that the orbits of the three bodies were on the same plane . in the current paper",
    ", we extend the derivation to the more general case of non - coplanar orbits . generally , the method is the same as in the coplanar regime , although more terms are included in the derivation of the short period equations to improve the accuracy of the model .",
    "there are also some minor changes in the calculation of the secular contribution to the eccentricity .",
    "other recent work on the dynamics of hierarchical triple system includes the work done by , and .",
    "the theoretical model is constructed in the same way as in the coplanar case : we derive expressions for the short period terms by using the definition of the runge - lenz vector , while the secular evolution is studied by means of canonical perturbation theory .",
    "the combination of the short period and secular part of the eccentricity is achieved by considering the eccentricity ( inner or outer ) to consist of a short period and a long period ( secular ) component , i.e. @xmath3 ( one can picture this by recalling the expansion of the disturbing function in solar system dynamics , where the perturbing potential is given as a sum of an infinite number of cosines of various frequencies ) . thus",

    "the semi - major axes and mean motions were treated as constants in the above calculation .      secular terms can not be obtained by the method of sect .",
    "[ s1 ] , because , for an eccentric outer binary , those terms appear as a linear function of time in the expansion of the eccentric vector and therefore , they are valid for limited time .",

    "the same sign error appears in .",
    "after some exploratory numerical integrations of the five equations of motion of the system , using a 4th - order runge - kutta method with variable stepsize @xcite , it became clear that the outer secular eccentricity and the inclination remained almost constant .",

    "as was stated in the previous section , the outer secular eccentricity remains almost constant .",
    "thus , the only thing that remains now is to obtain an estimate for the initial outer secular eccentricity .",
    "this can be done in the following way : first , we find an expression for the short period outer eccentricity , by following the same procedure as we did in sect .",

    "<S> in a previous paper , we developed a technique for estimating the inner eccentricity in coplanar hierarchical triple systems on initially circular orbits , with comparable masses and with well separated components , based on an expansion of the rate of change of the runge - lenz vector . </S>",
    "<S> now , the same technique is extended to non - coplanar orbits . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can only be applied to systems with @xmath0 or @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the inclination of the two orbits , because of complications arising from the so - called kozai effect. the theoretical model is tested against results from numerical integrations of the full equations of motion . </S>"
