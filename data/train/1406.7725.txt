    "inflation ( * ? ? ? * ( guth 1981 , ) ( * ? ? ? * linde 1982 ) ) is currently the most favoured model describing the early universe , in which perturbations are produced by quantum fluctuations during the epoch of an accelerated expansion .",
    "the simplest models of inflation predict a near scale - invariant primordial power spectrum described in terms of a spectral index @xmath0 , an amplitude of the perturbations @xmath1 and a possible ` running ' @xmath2 of the spectral index @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a pivot scale .",
    "the near scale - invariant spectrum with @xmath5 fits the current observations very well ( * ? ? ? * ( ade  2013a , ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ade  2013b ) ) .",
    "the recent planck data , combined with the wmap large - scale polarisation , constrain the spectral index to @xmath6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( ade  2013a ) ) , ruling out exact scale invariance at over @xmath7 . also , planck does not find a statistically significant running of the scalar spectral index , obtaining @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , high - resolution cmb experiments , such as the south pole telescope ( spt ) , report a small running of the spectral index ; @xmath9 at @xmath10 confidence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( hou  2012 ) ) .",
    "however , in general , any such detections have been small and consistent with zero .",
    "determining the shape of the primordial spectrum generally consists of two approaches , one by parametrisation and the second by reconstruction .",
    "non - parametric methods suffer from the non - invertibility of the transfer function that descries the _ transfer _ from @xmath11 to the cmb spectrum : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angular wavenumber and @xmath14 is the radiation transfer function . because of the singularity of the transfer function and the limitations on the data due to effects such as projection , cosmic variance , instrumental noise , point sources , and etc .",
    ", a sensitive algorithm is necessary for an accurate reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum from cmb data .",

    "this field can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions @xmath18 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the spherical harmonic coefficients , that have a gaussian distribution with zero mean , @xmath21 , and variance @xmath22 . in practice ,",
    "we are restricted by cosmic variance , additive instrumental noise and also , due to the different galactic foregrounds , we need to mask the observed cmb map , which induces correlations between different modes . taking these effects into account and following the master method from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hivon  ( 2002 ) ) , the pseudo power spectrum @xmath23 and the empirical power spectrum @xmath24 , which is defined as @xmath25 , can be related through their ensemble averages @xmath26 , where @xmath27 describes the mode - mode coupling due to the mask .",
    "we note that in this expression @xmath28 , and we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to the cmb and the noise spectra of the masked maps , respectively .",
    "we assume the pseudo spectrum @xmath23 follows a @xmath33 distribution with @xmath34 degrees of freedom and can be modelled as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a random variable representing a multiplicative noise .",
    "the relation between the discretized primordial spectrum @xmath37 and the pseudo spectrum @xmath23 , computed on a masked noisy map of the sky , can be condensed in the following form @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "because of the non - invertibility of @xmath40 , recovering @xmath41 constitutes an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "this inverse problem can be regularised in a robust way by using the sparse nature of the reconstructed signal as a prior . furthermore",
    ", sparse recovery has already been successfully used in the tousi algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( paykari  2012 ) ) to handle the multiplicative noise term , where after the stabilisation , the noise can be treated as an additive gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the sparse regularisation framework means that if @xmath41 can be sparsely represented in an adapted dictionary @xmath42 , then this problem , known as the basis pursuit denoising bpdn , can be recast as an optimisation problem , formulated as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the reconstructed estimate for @xmath41 .",
    "the first term imposes a @xmath45 fidelity constraint to the data while the second term promotes the sparsity constraint of the solution in dictionary @xmath42 , by tuning @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 optimisation problem in the second term can not be solved directly , therefore , we estimate the solution by solving a sequence of relaxed problems using a re - weighted @xmath48 minimisation technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( candes 2007 ) ) @xmath49_i   |\\ ; , \\label{eq : reweighted - bp - lagragian } } \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix applying a different weight for each wavelet coefficient , @xmath51 is our estimate of the residual in the fidelity term in eq .",
    "and @xmath52 is the noise on the residual .",
    "our specific choice of the @xmath53 has allowed us to use a single regularisation parameter @xmath54 which translates into a significance level threshold for feature detection .",
    "the relaxed problem can be solved by ista ( iterative soft - thresholding algorithm ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an adapted step size and @xmath57 is the proximal operator corresponding to the sparsity constraint .",

    "* paykari  ( 2014 ) ) .",
    "we apply prism to @xmath58 simulated pseudo spectra for three different types of @xmath41 .",
    "the reconstructions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] with the details being explained in the caption .",
    "we also apply prism to the wmap nine - year and planck pr1 lgmca cmb pseudo spectra ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( bobin   2014 ) ) and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] . we have not detected any significant deviations , whether local or global , from a scale - invariant primordial spectrum .",
    "the reconstruction of the primordial spectrum is limited by different effects on different scales .",
    "on very large scales , there are fundamental physical limitations due to the cosmic variance and the more severe geometrical projection of the modes , meaning the primordial spectrum can not be fully recovered on these scales , even in a perfect cmb measurement . on small scales",
    "we are limited by the instrumental noise , point sources , beam uncertainties , and etc .. this leaves us with a window through which we can recover the primordial spectrum with a good accuracy . nevertheless , as can be seen in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] , for @xmath59 , prism can easily distinguish the two very similar spectra and performs very well in reconstructing the position and amplitude of the featured spectra , as shown on the right hand plot .",
    "to conclude , the prism algorithm uses the sparsity of the primordial spectrum as well as an adapted modelling of the noise of the cmb spectrum to recover the primordial spectrum .",
    "this algorithm assumes no prior shape for the primordial spectrum and does not require a coarse binning of the primordial spectrum , making it sensitive to both global smooth features ( e.g. running of the spectral index ) as well as local sharp features ( e.g. a bump or an oscillatory feature ) .",
    "another advantage of this method is that the regularisation parameter can be specified in terms of a signal - to - noise significance level for feature detection .",
    "these advantages make this technique very suitable for investigating different types of departures from scale invariance , whether it is the running of the spectral index or some localised sharp features as predicted by some of the inflationary models .",
    "we have applied prism to lgmca wmap nine - year and planck pr1 spectra and have not detected any significant deviations from a scale - invariant power spectrum , whether local or global such as a running of the spectral index ."
