    "<S> this is a study of phase - coherent conduction through a ballistic point contact with disordered leads . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder imposes mesoscopic ( sample - to - sample ) fluctuations and weak - localization corrections on the conductance , and also leads to time - dependent fluctuations ( shot noise ) of the current . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are computed by means of a mapping onto an unconstricted conductor with a renormalized mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping holds both in the metallic and in the localized regime , and permits a solution for arbitrary ratio of mean free path to sample length . in the case of a single - channel quantum point contact , </S>",
    "<S> the mapping is onto a one - dimensional disordered chain , for which the complete distribution of the conductance is known . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is supported by numerical simulations . </S>"
