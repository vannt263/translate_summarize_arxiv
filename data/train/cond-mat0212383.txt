    "a year ago a robust and a simple way to extract this anisotropy from the data on @xmath21 dependence of the magnetization of _ random powders _ taken in various fixed fields has been suggested @xcite .",

    "this method constitutes a robust procedure independent either of a particular model for describing the anisotropy or of a degree of powder randomness .",

    "this simple method may not work .",
    "still , given difficulties in growing single crystals of a sufficient size often encountered when a new material is synthesized , the method may prove useful and sometimes the only one available for determination of the @xmath17 anisotropy .",

    "this strange behavior can be tracked down to the angular dependence of the line energy of a single vortex : the energy cost of having an elliptical core for vortices along @xmath173 for which the current distribution far from the core is near isotropic ( as for the example with @xmath201 ) is too high .    to illustrate how the angular dependence of the torque varies with anisotropies of @xmath17 and @xmath9",
    ", we evaluate numerically the torque density ( [ trq1 ] ) for parameters in the range of those for clean mgb@xmath0 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath202 for @xmath203 and @xmath204 , the values expected for temperatures somewhat below @xmath6 .",
    "qualitatively , the dependence is standard ; the torque is positive in the whole angular domain , i.e. , @xmath172 is the stable equilibrium .    with decreasing @xmath21 , @xmath25 of mgb@xmath0 increases whereas @xmath150 decreases . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the torque ( [ trq1 ] ) is plotted for @xmath205 , @xmath206 ( the upper curve ) and for @xmath207 , @xmath208 ( the lower curve ) .",
    "these values correspond roughly to 0.7 and 0.6@xmath209 according to ref .",
    "clearly , @xmath172 as well as @xmath210 are unstable ; the stable equilibrium is shifted to @xmath211 .    finally , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the torque density for parameters which correspond to low temperatures , where @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the torque is negative for all angles implying the stable equilibrium at @xmath210 .",
    "hence , different gaps at different fermi surface pieces of mgb@xmath0 ( or generally , anisotropic gaps on anisotropic fermi surfaces ) may lead to profound macroscopic consequences such as those considered above .",
    "moreover , since @xmath25 determines the anisotropy of the coherence length and , therefore , of the vortex core , whereas @xmath150 describes the ellipticity of the current distribution far from the core , the symmetry of the intervortex interaction should depend on the intervortex spacing , i.e. , on the field @xmath214 and its direction . in clean mgb@xmath0 at low temperatures in fields along @xmath173 ,",
    "one expects to have the standard triangular ( hexagonal ) vortex lattice in low fields ( @xmath215 ) , which should evolve to a distorted triangular ( orthorhombic ) lattice in increasing fields when the core ellipticity ( @xmath213 ) becomes relevant for the vortex current distribution .",
    "the field dependence of the vortex lattice structure should become weaker at elevated temperatures and disappear near @xmath6 where @xmath216 .",
    "in intermediate temperature range where the equilibrium vortex lattice orientation shifts from @xmath172 to lower angles , one may expect peculiar vortex dynamics ( as for fields near parallel to the layers of high-@xmath6 materials ) .",
    "this possibility calls for further study .",
    "thus , the question  what is the anisotropy parameter of mgb@xmath0 ? \" does not have a unique answer . to pose the question",
    "properly one should specify the quantity of interest .",
    "if this is @xmath17 , the answer is given by the upper curve of fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] for a clean material ; if this is @xmath9 , see the dashed line .",
    "if this is the magnetization in intermediate fields , @xmath217 , the main contribution to anisotropy comes from @xmath9 ; however , the @xmath17 anisotropy contributes as well ( being smoothed by the logarithm ) .",
    "the last situation should be taken into account while extracting anisotropy from the torque data in tilted fields @xcite .",
    "it should be noted in closing , that all anisotropies discussed here might be suppressed by impurities .",
