    "atlas and cms collaborations recently announced a small enhancement over smooth background of two photon events with invariant mass 750  gev  @xcite .",
    "though statistical significance of this enhancement is not large ( within 3 standard deviations ) , it induced a whole bunch of theoretical papers devoted to its interpretation .",
    "the reason for this explosive activity is clear : maybe the standard model of particle physics is changed at one tev scale , and we are witnessing the first sign of this change .    let us suppose that the observed enhancement is due to the @xmath2 decay of a new particle",
    ". then it should be a boson with spin different from one ; the simplest possibility is a scalar particle @xmath0 with @xmath3  gev .",
    "since it decays to two photons , it should be an @xmath4 singlet , and in @xmath5-collisions at the lhc it can be produced in gluon - gluon fusion through the loop of colored particles and in photon - photon fusion through the loop of charged particles .",
    "let us suppose that particles propagating in the loops are heavy , and @xmath0 decays to them are kinematically forbidden .",
    "reduces significantly which makes @xmath6 decays unobservable at the lhc . ]",
    "production cross section is evidently larger in the case of gluon fusion , however @xmath6 branching ratio is suppressed in this case since @xmath7 decay dominates .",
    "we suppose that the particles propagating in the loop are dirac fermions , so they have tree level masses , and that they are @xmath8 singlets .",
    "nonzero hypercharges provide couplings of these particles with photon and @xmath9-boson .",
    "these particles can be quark(s ) ( color triplets ) @xmath10 or lepton(s ) ( color singlets ) @xmath11 .",
    "they couple with @xmath0 by yukawa interactions with coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspondingly .    in section",
    "[ s : quarkophilic ] we will consider @xmath0 production and decay in the model with extra heavy quark(s ) , in which gluon fusion dominates @xmath0 production ; in section  [ s : leptophilic ] we will consider the model with extra heavy lepton(s ) , where @xmath0 production occur in photon fusion , and @xmath14 decay dominates .",
    "in the case of one heavy quark @xmath15 the following terms should be added to the standard model lagrangian : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are gluon and @xmath19 gauge fields respectively , and @xmath20 are gell - mann matrices . @xmath0 coupling with gluons is generated by the @xmath15-quark loop : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23,\\ ] ] and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "inclusive cross section of @xmath0 production in @xmath5 collision at the lhc through gluon fusion is given by : @xmath26 where the so - called gluon - gluon luminosity is given by the integral over gluon distributions : @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and we use @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - production ] the corresponding feynman diagram is shown .",

    "total width of @xmath0 is dominated by the @xmath46 decay , and from   we get : @xmath47 four orders of magnitude smaller than the 45  gev width which ( maybe ) follows from the preliminary atlas data .",
    "thus we conclude that for the models we consider , @xmath0 width should be much smaller than 45  gev .",

    "in this case @xmath60 , @xmath45 remains the same , while the cross section of @xmath0 production   should be multiplied by the same factor 36 , and   is reproduced .",

    "such an extension of the standard model was studied in our recent paper  @xcite .",
    "doublet admixture in the 750  gev boson wave function results in tree level decays @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the 125  gev higgs boson .",

    "( 16)(20 ) from  @xcite , the sum of these widths equals approximately @xmath77  gev , where @xmath78 is the mixing angle , and @xmath79  gev is the higgs boson vacuum expectation value",
    ". ratio of partial widths at small @xmath78 is @xmath80 as a result , @xmath0 width grows and @xmath45 diminishes correspondingly .",
    "thus , experimental result   will not be reproduced . to reduce this effect",
    "we should make the mixing angle @xmath78 small enough .",
