    "the high precision of current collider data requires comparable precision in the phenomenological predictions .",
    "the state of the art in high - energy calculations is at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "consequently , major efforts have been undertaken to produce nnlo parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) from a global analysis of the available data .",
    "these include the ct14nnlo pdfs  @xcite as well as others  @xcite , all of which include lhc data in the determination of the pdfs .",
    "in this paper we describe the introduction of qed evolution at leading order ( lo ) with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd evolution in the same cteq global analysis package that was used to produce the ct14 pdfs  @xcite .",
    "past studies of qed effects in global analysis have been done by the mrst  @xcite and the nnpdf  @xcite groups . we have checked our code against other qed@xmath5qcd evolution codes  @xcite and find good agreement .",
    "the mrst and nnpdf analyses used different approaches for modeling the photon pdf .",
    "the mrst group used a parametrization for the photon pdf based on radiation off of `` primordial '' up and down quarks , with the photon radiation cut off at low scales by constituent or current quark masses  @xcite .",
    "the nnpdf group used a more general photon parametrization , which was then constrained by high - energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 and drell - yan data at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "they found constraints on the size of the photon pdf , which was still consistent with zero at the initial scale of @xmath8 gev .",
    "as discussed by martin and ryskin  @xcite , the photon pdf has a large _ elastic _ contribution in which the proton remains intact , in addition to the _ inelastic _ contribution in which the proton breaks into a multihadron final state .",
    "neither mrst nor nnpdf addresses these separate contributions to the photon pdf , although we can assume that the nnpdf photon is _ inclusive _ , containing both inelastic and elastic components , since it was constrained using inclusive drell - yan and vector boson data .",
    "given the limited amount of data to constrain the shape of the photon pdf , we will use a generalization of the mrst approach .",
    "we parametrize the inelastic contribution to the photon at the initial scale gev is the same as that used in the standard ct14 pdf sets , and was chosen to be just below the input charm pole mass of @xmath9 gev . ]",

    "we then set @xmath14 to obtain a single parameter family of photon distributions , which we can label by their initial inelastic momentum fraction @xmath15 .",
    "for comparison , in analogy with the mrst approach , we will also show results for a `` current mass '' ( cm ) photon distribution , given by defining @xmath16 , and setting the @xmath17 to the quark current masses ; _ i.e. , _",

    "we will constrain the inelastic photon pdf using data on deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with isolated photons from the zeus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using this process is that the initial - state photon contributions are at leading order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "in contrast , the initial - state photon contribution to drell - yan or @xmath6 and @xmath7 production is suppressed by factors of @xmath20 relative to the leading quark - antiquark production . however , to use the dis - plus - photon data we will first need to address some technical issues relating to the combination of different subprocess contributions to the observed final state .",

    "[ sec : constraints ] we discuss constraints on the photon pdf coming from the ct14 global analysis data set and from the zeus dis with isolated photon data . in this section",
    "we present a new calculation for the dis - plus - isolated - photon process , which consistently combines the photon - initiated contribution with the quark - initiated contribution .",
    "we show that this data gives significant constraints on the initial photon pdf . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] we discuss our findings and give conclusions .",
    "we also include an appendix where we show comparisons between our qcd@xmath5qed evolution code and other publicly - available codes .",
    "in this section we discuss the implementation of the qed evolution and the initial photon pdf in the context of the cteq - tea global analysis program .",
    "the evolution of the pdfs , @xmath21 , including qed contributions at leading order ( lo ) and qcd contributions at higher orders , is described by the equations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , the indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 run over active quark flavors , and the convolution is defined by @xmath26 the qcd splitting functions , given by @xmath27 are known up to @xmath28 , next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )  @xcite .",

    "we have modified the fortran nlo evolution code evolve , which was used for previous cteq - tea pdfs ( cteq6 - 6.6  @xcite-@xcite and ct09  @xcite ) , to include the lo qed contributions .",
    "this code solves the evolution equations directly in @xmath31-space , so that the only new technical issue introduced by the qed corrections is the separation of the quark singlet distributions into separate up and down contributions , based on the quark charges .",
    "we have checked our evolution code against the public qcd@xmath5qed codes , partonevolution  @xcite and apfel  @xcite , and we find good agreement .",
    "details of this comparison are given in the appendix .",
    "the initial photon pdf at the scale @xmath4 is a nonperturbative input that must be obtained by a fit to data .",
    "even a choice of zero initial photon pdf is ambiguous , since it depends on the arbitrary scale @xmath4 .",
    "so far there have been two different approaches to the initial photon pdf . in the mrst analysis  @xcite the initial photon pdf was given by an ansatz , obtained from radiation off primordial valence up and down quark distributions , cut off at low scales given by the current quark masses , @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev , or by constituent quark masses @xmath34 mev .",
    "alternatively , the nnpdf approach  @xcite was to use a general parametrization for the initial photon pdf to be constrained by high - energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and drell - yan production at the lhc .    in this work we will use a generalization of the mrst ansatz , but we must first address a subtlety of the photon pdf . unlike the case for colored partons ,",
    "the photon pdf has a large elastic component , in which the proton remains intact  @xcite .",
    "this is in addition to the inelastic component , in which the proton dissociates .",
    "the elastic component can be parametrized by the equivalent photon approximation ( epa )  @xcite , which involves an integration over the proton electromagnetic form factors . for this work we focus on the inelastic component , which we parametrize by a radiative ansatz , but with free parameters to be fit by data .",
    "given the weak constraints from data on the photon pdf , we find it useful to limit the number of parameters to one or two for the time being .",
    "we shall see that the zeus dis - plus - isolated - photon data  @xcite constrains the inelastic photon pdf roughly in the range @xmath35 for @xmath36 gev@xmath37 .",
    "we parametrize the inelastic contribution to the initial photon pdfs in the proton and neutron by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are `` primordial '' valence - type distributions in the proton , and the initial photon pdf in the neutron is obtained by an approximate isospin symmetry . defining @xmath16",
    ", we can trade the parameters @xmath41 for mass scales @xmath17 , and we see that the nonperturbative inputs @xmath42 are modeled by the radiation of a single photon off the `` primordial '' quarks , with a collinear cutoff given by the scales @xmath17 .",
    "the mrst initial photon pdfs can be obtained from this parametrization by setting @xmath43 gev , using the functions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and letting @xmath46 and @xmath47 be either the constituent or current quark masses . for our analysis , we use @xmath1 gev as in ct14 , and we set @xmath48 the initial up and down ct14 nlo valence distributions in the proton .",
    "the presence of the photon pdf violates isospin between the neutron and proton . continuing with the radiative ansatz and working to first order in @xmath49",
    ", we can neglect the isospin violation in the gluon and sea - quark pdfs  @xcite and use @xmath50 for the valence quarks at first order in @xmath49 , the radiative ansatz plus approximate isospin symmetry implies @xmath51 this suggests a consistent set of pdfs for the valence quarks in the neutron given by @xmath52 note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : photonpdf ] ) and ( [ eq : valencen ] ) together ensure that if the number and momentum sum rules ( including the photon contribution ) are satisfied for the pdfs in the proton , they are automatically satisfied for the pdfs in the neutron , regardless of the choices for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "again , for our analysis , we choose @xmath44 and @xmath45 to equal the initial up and down ct14 nlo valence distributions in the proton .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : photonpdf])-([eq : sea ] ) and ( [ eq : valencen ] ) we can obtain the quark , gluon , and photon pdfs in both the proton and neutron in terms of the parametrization of the quark and gluon pdfs in the proton , plus the two additional parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    for this paper , we shall make the further simplification of @xmath14 , which corresponds to cutting off the radiation from both valence quarks at the same scale . with this choice ,",
    "everything is specified by one additional parameter , which can be taken to be the cutoff scale @xmath55 , defined by @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , we can trade this parameter for the initial inelastic photon momentum fraction in the proton : @xmath57 for the remainder of this paper , unless otherwise specified , the photon pdfs will be in this one - parameter radiation ansatz labeled by @xmath0 .",
    "for comparison purposes , we will make one exception to this by defining a `` current mass '' ( cm ) photon pdf , analogous to the mrst current mass pdf , and given by @xmath16 with @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev . for this choice",
    "the initial inelastic photon momentum fraction is determined to be @xmath58% . for all other partons in our analysis",
    "we use the ct14 nlo initial distributions , except that to maintain a total momentum fraction of 1 , we re - normalize the initial up , down , and strange sea - quark distributions , to account for the additional photon momentum fraction . given that the relevant photon momentum fractions are very small , we find that this reduces the sea - quark distributions by typically less than 1% , and it is inconsequential in our analysis .",

    "given that cuts of @xmath73 gev@xmath37 , applied to enforce perturbativity in the calculations , typically require @xmath74 , we expect constraints from isospin violation to be small in the present data , as observed in the mrst analysis  @xcite .",
    "constraints from the momentum sum rule arise because any momentum carried by the photon implies less momentum available for the quark and gluon pdfs . in this way",
    ", constraints from data on the colored parton pdfs indirectly impact the photon pdf .",
    "we have performed a preliminary analysis using the data sets included for ct10  @xcite . for a fixed initial photon momentum fraction , with the photon pdf parametrized as discussed in sec .",
    "ii , we minimized the global @xmath75 by varying the quark and gluon pdfs . using the usual cteq - tea choice of @xmath76 tolerance ,",

    "additional constraints were made on the initial photon pdf by including lhc data on high - energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and drell - yan production , and comparing with theoretical predictions that included photon initial - state contributions .",
    "although the photon - induced contribution to these processes is small compared to the dominant quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess , the precision of these measurements was enough to substantially increase the constraints on the photon pdf  @xcite .",
    "however , the small relative contribution of the photon - photon subprocess puts a stringent requirement on the precision needed for both experimental and theoretical analyses .",
    "any small misjudgment of systematic errors on the experimental side , or uncalculated higher - order corrections on the theoretical side could have a significant effect on the extraction of the photon pdf .",
    "in particular , given that the initial photon pdf is nominally of order @xmath49 , one might expect that the uncalculated @xmath81 quark - initiated contributions to drell - yan production would contribute at the same level as the photon - initiated contributions .",
    "for this reason , we consider a different experimental process , isolated photon production in dis , to constrain the photon pdf .      at the partonic level",
    ", the process of dis with isolated photon occurs at lo through compton scattering of a photon coming from the proton off the lepton , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiags](a ) .",

    "however , all other nlo terms are proportional to @xmath83 , which is in fact suppressed by an amount of order @xmath49 relative to @xmath84 , as seen in the previous section .",
    "thus , by keeping the photon - initiated contribution at lo and the quark - initiated contributions at nlo , and including the collinear - subtraction counterterm of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ap ] ) we have a well - defined calculation in the @xmath94 scheme , while maintaining all contributions of the same size in @xmath49 .",

    "the relevant detector - level cut was the requirement of at least one reconstructed track , well separated from the lepton , which was used to ensure some hadronic activity and to remove deeply virtual compton scattering events .",
    "after this cut , it was found that the number of events in the monte carlo calculations with @xmath152 gev was negligible . for our purposes , we interpret the forward track cut as a requirement to tag inelastic events , and we include no explicit @xmath151 cut .",

    "so we have made the approximation @xmath153 ; _ i.e. , _ the elastic and inelastic components of the photon pdf evolve separately .",
    "this approximation is good because @xmath154 changes very little from @xmath4 to @xmath140 due to the rapid falloff of the proton electromagnetic form factor , while the inelastic contribution evolves additively , @xmath155 up to corrections suppressed by extra factors of @xmath49 .",
    "we have verified by explicit calculation that this additive approximation replicates the consistently evolved inclusive photon pdf , with errors that are far smaller than other theoretical uncertainties that we will discuss below .",
    "the second additional important cut is the isolation cut on the photon , enforcing that 90% of the energy in the jet containing the photon belongs to the photon , where jets are formed with the @xmath156 cluster algorithm with parameter @xmath157 .",

    ", we call this the `` sharp '' isolation cut .",
    "since this does not completely remove the quark - photon collinear singularity , the theoretical calculation of the @xmath86 component will depend on the choice of the quark - to - photon fragmentation function @xmath160 .",

    "note that this parametrization of @xmath160 is an exact solution to the evolution equation at @xmath82 , so that the dependence on the fragmentation scale @xmath109 cancels exactly in our calculation . in the ggp analysis  @xcite ,",
    "other parametrizations of @xmath160 with different assumptions were compared , with only a small effect on the calculated cross sections .",
    "one of the disadvantages of having a dependence on the quark - to - photon fragmentation function , in addition to the uncertainties due to the phenomenological fit to the function , is that it assumes that the cross section is inclusive in the fragmentation remnant . in our calculation",
    ", the combination of the experimental constraints on the photon and on the lepton indirectly imposes constraints on the remnant quark in the process .",
    "therefore , we also consider an alternative model of the experimental isolation cut , replacing it with a `` smooth '' isolation cut  @xcite , so as to avoid the necessity of the fragmentation contribution .",
    "the smooth isolation cut is given by requiring that the hadronic energy @xmath164 inside all cones of radius @xmath165 around the photon direction satisfy @xmath166 where we take @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "these values of @xmath169 and @xmath170 are chosen to ensure that the photon will contain at least 90% of the energy inside a cone of @xmath171 centered on the photon , just as for the experimental isolation cut .",
    "however , the smooth cut does not translate exactly to the experimental isolation cut , because it requires the photon to carry a greater fraction of the energy as the cone size @xmath172 becomes smaller . in practice , because of this , the theoretical calculation with the smooth cut is better behaved than with the sharp cut .",
    "in addition , the smooth isolation cut is more restrictive than the sharp isolation ; for a strictly positive - definite differential cross section , the smooth isolation prescription must always give a smaller predicted cross section .",
    "in this way , a comparison of the two calculations can give some indication of the theoretical uncertainty due to the isolation cut .",
    "finally , we note that the jet - clustering algorithm also includes the electron , so that the isolation cut effectively imposes @xmath173 .     and correspond to the total prediction ( light gray solid ) , the @xmath86 component ( blue hashed ) , the @xmath85 component ( dark red solid ) , and the photon - initiated contribution only ( green hashed ) . also shown",

    "the @xmath87 contribution is imperceptible on the scale of these plots . from these plots we learn several important facts .",
    "first , the scale dependence of the @xmath85 component is reduced dramatically compared to the photon - initiated contribution alone .",

    "second , the @xmath85 and @xmath86 components dominate in different regions of phase space . for instance , the cross sections are most sensitive to the @xmath85 component , and consequently to the photon pdf , at large @xmath141 and small @xmath142 . thus , the shapes of these distributions can give information about the nonperturbative contribution to the photon pdf .",
    "finally , we note that the scale dependence of the @xmath86 component is still large , being only lo in @xmath177 , and it dominates the overall scale uncertainty of the theoretical calculation .    in fig .",

    "another striking feature is that the prediction using the smooth isolation prescription is uniformly larger than that using the sharp isolation , in contrast to expectations .",
    "this is probably due to incomplete cancellations in the sharp isolation calculation between the large negative collinear fragmentation contribution and the positive real contribution , due to indirect constraints on the emitted final - state quark in the real emission contribution .",

    "this is presumably much less than other uncertainties in our analysis , so it is reasonable to leave out the lepton pdf contribution in our code .",
    "the percent difference in our prediction for the photon pdf , relative to the partonevolution prediction with and without the inclusion of the lepton pdfs , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pecomp ] .    we have also checked our code against the program apfel  @xcite , which includes qed at lo and qcd at up to nnlo .",
    "the main difference in the apfel program is that the qcd and qed factorization scales can be taken to be independent , and the evolution with respect to each scale can be done successively .",
    "however , using the setting `` qavdp '' in apfel averages the two possible orderings for performing the evolutions , which should agree with our approach to @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , the apfel code has been recently updated to allow the simultaneous evolution of the qed and qcd scales , using the `` qunid '' setting .",
    "we have compared our code with apfel 2.6.0 , starting with the ct10nlo pdfs  @xcite with zero initial photon pdf at @xmath214 gev and evolving in qed at lo and qcd at nlo to @xmath212 gev .",
    "we have done the comparison using both the `` qavdp '' and the `` qunid '' settings for apfel .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement for the quark and gluon pdfs , with differences of less than @xmath215% over most of the range of @xmath31 for both apfel settings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : apfelcomp ] we show the results for the photon pdf .",
    "we obtain pretty good agreement with apfel with the `` qavdp '' setting , with differences of less than @xmath218% except at large @xmath219 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath81 differences expected in the different evolution procedures .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement with apfel with the `` qunid '' setting , with differences of less than @xmath220% over the full range of @xmath221 shown .",
    "we note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : apfelcomp ] we replace the evolution subroutine for @xmath49 in the apfel program with the code used in the ct global analysis code ; however , using the original @xmath49 subroutine in apfel still gives differences of less than 1% for the evolved photon pdf over the full range of @xmath31 when using the `` qunid '' setting .",
    "this is certainly much smaller than the uncertainties in the initial photon pdf itself .",
    "we have not checked our code directly against the mrst evolution code or the recently developed qcdnum+qed evolution code  @xcite , but we do note that the comparison between qcdnum+qed and apfel `` qavdp '' for the evolution of the photon pdf in ref .",
    "@xcite looks qualitatively similar to the results that we have found in fig .",
    "[ fig : apfelcomp ] . in addition",
    "benchmarking studies between apfel and these two evolution codes in ref .",
    "@xcite show agreement at a similar level to that which we have found with our code here .",
