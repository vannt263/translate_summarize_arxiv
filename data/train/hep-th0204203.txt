    "recently , the importance of unstable brane systems has been recognised widely .",
    "one of the most successful utilization of the unstable brane systems was sen s conjectures @xcite which enable one to study the classification of the d - branes by k - theories and to define new open string field theories , via tachyon condensation .",
    "however , most of the tachyon condensation considered in the literatures have been static .",
    "the next step toward obtaining information on the determination of the true vacuum of string / m theory may be to analyse and understand the time - dependent dynamics of the decay of the unstable brane systems .",
    "the main obstacles to progress along this important direction is that string theory contains infinite number of field degrees of freedom .",
    "the recent observation of `` rolling tachyon '' by a.  sen @xcite has picked up an open string tachyon field in unstable brane systems , and studied how the homogeneous tachyon rolls down the potential . there",
    "the initial conditions of the tachyon field became important .",
    "however , it might be plausible to consider the situation where the decay starts from a false vacuum , and a quantum tunneling provides a classically unstable initial condition , then the unstable mode rolls down the potential hill .    in this paper , we investigate two typical unstable systems which are classically stable but cause a decay through the tunnel effect : ( i ) a d@xmath1-brane and an anti - d@xmath1-brane located in parallel with separation @xmath0 , and ( ii ) dielectric branes @xcite in constant ramond - ramond ( rr ) field strength .",
    "these brane systems are nonperturbatively unstable and decay through the quantum tunneling . as for ( i ) , the parallel branes are expected to nucleate a throat bridge which connects these two branes by the tunnel effect , and then this throat expands to sweep out the brane - antibrane pair . concerning ( ii ) , the dielectric brane ( which is classically stable ) instantly expands to form a larger spherical d - brane which is classically unstable , and then the large spherical brane starts expanding gradually due to its classical instability . the situations ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) are similar to each other as for the processes of the decay , although the description of these branes are completely different .",
    "the situation ( i ) is described by the condensation of the tachyon field coming from open strings connecting the brane and the antibrane , while the situation ( ii ) is described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action of the dielectric brane in the constant rr field strength .",
    "however , we will find their similarity in the analysis of the decay .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "the paper consists of two parts which are almost independent of each other .",
    "the first part ( sec .",
    "2 ) treats the decay of the dielectric branes , and the second part ( sec .",
    "3 ) deals with the decay of the brane - antibrane .",
    "the second part uses the implication from sec .  2 .",
    "each part has introductory remarks .    in sec .  2",
    ", we observe that the branes in the background rr field strength are generically curled up , and utilizing this coordinate choice for the brane worldvolume we compute the decay width of the dielectric branes . the relevant bounce configuration in the euclidean target space is found to be a funnel - shaped .",
    "in addition , another new doughnut - shaped branes are found to describe the bounce solution for nucleating a dielectric brane from nothing .    in sec .  3",
    ", first we construct an action of the tachyon field theory on the brane - antibrane separated by @xmath0 .",
    "then we obtain the bounce solution by following coleman s method to give the decay width . by checking the scalar field configuration on this tachyon bounce background we find an evidence for that the bounce solution is actually describing a throat connecting the brane and the antibrane .",
    "we apply this method also to find the width of the decay with leaving lower dimensional stable d - branes as topological defects",
    ". this may be relevant for the recent inflationary braneworld scenario .",
    "we also consider the d0-brane anti - d0-brane decay by combining and generalizing the results of sec .  2 .",
    "we conclude with several remarks and comments on the future directions in the final section .",
    "the appendices treat two topics : how the tachyon potential found in sec .",
    "2 is corrected to the higher order in the framework of the boundary string field theory ( bsft ) , and how the introduction of the non - commutativity induces stable non - commutative solitons on the brane - antibrane .",
    "it is well known that d - branes and strings can decay via the tunnel effect in the background of the constant r - r field strength @xcite . along",
    "similar argument , one can find that the myers dielectric brane can decay via the tunnel effect .",
    "the final aim of this section is to compute the decay rate of the dielectric branes for a given background and a given number of constituent d0-branes in the dielectric brane .    to see that the dielectric branes can decay ,",
    "let us briefly review what was discussed by r.  c.   myers in @xcite .",

    "then the brane configuration is described only by the radius @xmath11 . turning on the magnetic field on the brane appropriately",
    ", one finds the energy of the spherical brane as @xmath12 , \\label{myene}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the area of @xmath15 with the unit radius and the volume of the region enclosed by that @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of the d0-branes bounded in the spherical d2-brane , coming from the worldvolume gauge field .",
    "myers found that by expanding the square root there exists a local minimum of the potential energy .",
    "one concludes that in the constant rr 4-form field strength @xmath16 d0-branes can expand and form a spherical bound state with a local d2-brane charge .",
    "one can get the exact radius of the dielectric brane by finding the extrema of the potential energy ( [ myene ] ) , @xmath17 the energy ( [ myene ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "one can easily find that this radius of the dielectric branes is merely a local minimum , and thus the dielectric branes can decay via the tunnel effect to form a larger sphere which is classically unstable and thus expands .",
    "another extremum is given by the radius @xmath18 this radius corresponds to the top of the hill in fig .",
    "[ figa ] ( the point a ) .",
    "the potential height at that point may characterize the decay width of the dielectric d2-brane .",
    "we understand that this tunnel effect occurs also with no initial d0-brane : for @xmath19 , the local minimum is simply @xmath20 , thus nothing",
    ". it can decay by producing a large spherical d2-brane .",
    "the energy potential is shown in fig .",
    "this is a generalization of schwinger process @xcite , nucleation of an electron - positron pair in a constant electric field .",
    "this phenomenon is not limited to the d2-brane case . for any constant rr background @xmath21 ,",
    "a spherical d@xmath1-brane formation occurs , and it expands so as to decrease the energy of the background rr - form .",
    "the width of the decay by this spherical brane formation was obtained in @xcite . if the target spacetime dimension is @xmath22 , the spherical brane sweeps out the rr background , although in this paper we will not consider this kind of back reaction .",

    "one can see that for the constant rr field strength we have the linear gauge potential for the chern - simons term of the action .",

    "the d - brane is `` curled up '' due to the constant rr field strength background .",
    "this hemisphere is to be understood as a part of a complete sphere .",
    "to form a complete sphere , we need both solutions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to join them together .",
    "the reason why the sign of the rr field flips is that in our worldvolume coordinate choice the orientation of the lower hemisphere is opposite to that of the upper hemisphere .",
    "this is a kind of a pair of a brane and an antibrane .",
    "this joining is somewhat similar to what has been found in the decay of the brane - antibrane pair in @xcite in which two volcano - shaped branes are combined to form a `` throat '' connecting a brane and an antibrane .",
    "the result is of course consistent with the configuration obtained with the spherical ansatz in the previous subsection . in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , there exists a sphere solution at the top of the potential hill ( the point c in the figure ) . for @xmath43 , the critical radius @xmath39 agrees with the one from the spherical ansatz ( [ rtop ] ) with @xmath44 .    how the branes are curled up depends on the background rr field strength . in the present case",
    "we have considered only the constant background , thus we have obtained the sphere which has a constant curvature of the worldvolume .",
    "this curvature depends on the value of the background rr field , thus for varying background some nontrivial shapes of the curled up branes are possible .",
    "we use this possibility to describe pair creation of d0-branes in the nontrivial rr background in sec .",
    "3.7 , by explicitly constructing a non - trivially curled - up euclidean worldline .",
    "let us generalize the above result to the dielectric branes on which the nontrivial magnetic flux is turned on .",

    "after all , compared with the decay width of the naive pair annihilation in the former analysis , we find that the decay width of the another decay mode of the pair creation is small , and it is not a dominant decay process .",
    "in this paper , we have studied decay of two typical unstable brane systems in string theory , from the viewpoint of open string excitations .",
    "the treated instability is due to the quantum tunnel effect , a transition from a false vacuum to the true vacuum .",
    "the first system is the dielectric d2-branes in the constant rr 4-form field strength ( sec .  2 ) .",
    "this can decay via the nucleation of a larger spherical brane which is classically unstable .",
    "we have given explicitly how to compute the decay width ( sec.2.4 ) .",
    "the new coordinate choice of the worldvolume has enabled us to perform the computation explicitly .",
    "we have found that the tunnel effect is given by the euclidean bounce solution which is the funnel - shaped brane configuration .",
    "another new brane configuration which is a doughnut - shaped has been found ( sec .",
    "2.5 ) , and this is relevant for nucleation of a dielectric brane from nothing . how the nucleated large spherical brane expands has been also described ( sec .",
    "the second system is the brane - antibrane located in parallel with separation @xmath0 ( sec .",
    "we have given the action of tachyon field theory on the brane - antibrane with the parameter @xmath0 ( sec .",
    "bsft corrections to the tachyon potential has been studied ( app .",
    "we have observed that this system sits at the false vacuum , the local minimum of the tachyon potential , @xmath145 . applying the generalized coleman s method ,",
    "we have obtained the decay width of the brane - antibrane ( sec .",
    "the decay starts with the nucleation of a true vacuum bubble which is a throat connecting the brane and the antibrane .",
    "we have shown that this interpretation is supported by examination of the scalar field configuration ( sec .",
    "the nucleated throat expands accordingly and sweeps out the brane - antibrane .",
    "in addition , we have analysed the tachyon condensation with leaving topological defects which are stable lower - dimensional d - branes ( sec .",
    "this may be relevant for the braneworld scenario as discussed later .",
    "we have also obtained the decay width of d0-@xmath146 in two ways : by the pair annihilation and by the nucleation of another pair , and found that the former is dominant decay mode ( sec .",
    "the noncommutative generalization has been also studied ( app .",
    "we have neglected the gravitational effect in this paper .",
    "this approximation may survive the gravitational correction only in limited situation as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1 ] .",
    "string theory necessarily contains gravity , thus brane physics especially in the large distance scale should be influenced by these closed string modes .",
    "it might be natural to consider a situation in which a brane and an antibrane are created at some time with separation , and due to the gravitational force and the rr gauge field exchange the branes attract each other . in this case , as the branes approach , the form of the tachyon potential varies . at some distance",
    "the quantum tunneling occurs and the throat is nucleated .",
    "this average distance of nucleation of the throat can be estimated by using our results of the decay width @xmath147 , and the result is roughly a string scale where the true perturbative instability appears .    one may think that more natural situation would be intersecting branes . generally on the intersection the tachyonic mode appears , and",
    "the joining - splitting of the brane surfaces may happen as a result of the tachyon condensation .",
    "we believe that our description of the tachyon condensation can be applied also on this intersection of the branes .",
    "the braneworld inflation scenario with the intersecting branes has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "since the decay width which we have computed is per the unit time and volume , severals throat ( or spherical branes ) may be nucleated simultaneously .",
    "then the bubbles may collide with each other and form a new large bubble .",
    "if the bubbles have charges of the lower dimensional branes , then those branes may be left inside the large bubble .",
    "this may be another mechanism for leaving lower dimensional branes in the dynamics of the tachyon condensation .    while the collision of the throats , most of the energy of the moving domain walls may be converted to the energy of the radiation of the closed string modes in the bulk .",
    "other than this , there are massive open string modes which may propagate in the false vacuum .",
    "we employed the effective field theory of the tachyon field , thus it receives @xmath148 corrections which we neglected in this paper .",
    "inclusion of open string massive modes and also closed string modes such as gravity is important .",
    "considering the closed string massless modes amounts to the inclusion of the back reaction which we have not considered in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "another interesting viewpoint is that there may be the gravity description which is `` dual '' to our open string description , as suggested from the @xmath149 channel duality of the string worldsheet theory and the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it is intriguing to study some duality between ours and the gravitational instabilities studied so far ( see for example @xcite for the gravitational description of the instabilities of some backgrounds ) .",
    "we leave these for the future work .",
    "to obtain a more precise expression for the tachyon potential @xmath150 , let us study the corrections of higher orders in @xmath0 derived from the bsft . as seen above ,",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the potential is coming from the covariant derivative through the t - duality .",
    "therefore , the first nontrivial corrections might come from the results of linear profiles in brane - antibrane system in the bsft @xcite .",
    "their result shows that , if we turn on a part of the tachyon which has a linear profile only along a certain direction in the target space , the bsft action is @xmath151 where @xmath152 since we turn on only the constant wilson line , the gauge field strength vanishes , thus the dependence on the gauge field comes only from the covariant derivative .",
    "we lift the above expression to include the covariant derivative by simply changing the argument of the function @xmath153 .",
    "noting that the t - duality is just a dimensional reduction , we obtain the resultant expression for the corrected tachyon potential for the brane - antibrane system : @xmath154    in the above argument we have used the linear tachyon profile .",
    "one may wonder if the @xmath0 dependence of the tachyon potential comes also from the higher derivative corrections such as @xmath155 .",
    "we can derive exact tachyon potential valid for all order in @xmath0 as in the following .",
    "let us recall how the bsft action is obtained .",
    "first we have the boundary interaction of a string sigma model @xcite @xmath156.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have written only the terms which are relevant for our calculation , and @xmath157 , @xmath158 after integrating out @xmath159 and adding the worldsheet action , we obtain @xmath160 therefore the @xmath161 dependence in the partition function is given by @xmath162 finally , by restoring the appropriate normalization , we have @xmath163 where @xmath164 . note that this expression is a bit different from the partition function for the brane - antibrane system for the linear tachyon profile ( [ a1 ] ) .    the final potential is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we can see that the form of the potential is qualitatively the same .",
    "one should note that the taylor expansion of the expression ( [ potbsft ] ) in terms of @xmath165 does not match ( [ potential ] ) , because the bsft result does depend on the renormalization scheme which is unknown in this context .",
    "the difference of the scale of these figures might come from that finite renormalization .",
    "one of the reasons why for the computation of the decay width we have used ( [ potential ] ) instead of the exact bsft result ( [ potbsft ] ) is that , the bsft result should include also the higher order derivative coupling of the tachyon fields , and it is very hard to adopt this for a practical computation . the potential ( [ potential ] ) was derived from the two derivative truncation , thus for the analysis with the kinetic terms of the two derivative truncation it might be better to use the tachyon potential derived in the same truncation .",
    "we believe that the full potential after the finite renormalization may have a similar structure .",
    "( 20,120)@xmath150 ( 180,20)@xmath77",
    "one of the early attempts to understand the decay of the brane - antibrane system is found in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite tried to construct the brane - antibrane effective action by using matrix theory .",
    "now we understand that this construction leads to a noncommutative worldvolume .    on the noncommutative worldvolume one can construct nontrivial co - dimension two solitons which are called noncommutative solitons @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative scalar solitons found their intriguing application in the tachyon condensation in string theory @xcite . since in the text",
    "we have not obtained analytic form of the bounce solution , the introduction of the noncommutativity may help us to construct it explicitly . in this appendix , we apply this method to our potential , and obtain stable solitons which are analogues of @xcite .",
    "we give the brane interpretation of them .",
    "first , let us briefly review what was found in @xcite . after an appropriate scaling of the background metric , b - field and @xmath148 , we obtain noncommutative worldvolume theory of the brane - antibrane .",
    "we assume that the result is simply the replacement of the ordinary field multiplication with the star product defined with the noncommutativity parameter @xmath166 . in the large noncommutativity limit",
    ", the authors of @xcite constructed a soliton solution whose form is determined only by the information of the extrema of the scalar potential : @xmath167 here @xmath168 is the value of @xmath169 which makes the potential extrema , and @xmath170 is the projection operator which satisfies @xmath171 . note that as explicitly written in @xcite the potential should have its local extrema at @xmath172 .",
    "one can easily find that our potential written by @xmath169 satisfies this requirement , and we have two extrema .",
    "one of them is the true vacuum @xmath173 .",
    "the stability argument developed in @xcite shows that if we choose @xmath174 as @xmath175 , then the solution ( [ ncsol ] ) is classically stable .",
    "let us consider what is this stable brane configuration .",
    "the simplest choice for the projection operator is @xmath176 it is easy to consider @xmath177 first .",
    "note that the above @xmath178 written in an operator representation is identical with a gaussian function whose width is given by @xmath179 .",
    "thus the solution @xmath180 is almost sitting at the true vacuum except for the disc region whose radius is @xmath181 and whose center is at the origin of the brane - antibrane worldvolume . inside this disc ,",
    "the tachyon is not condensed and thus the brane worldvolume exists , while outside of the disc the brane worldvolumes vanish . since",
    "two worldvolumes are separated now , one may imagine that the resultant form of the brane is spherical as if it were a dielectric brane .",
    "however , there is no mechanism to pop up branes in the constant b - field background ( if one turns on a constant h - field , then one can have a popped - up brane @xcite ) .",
    "then , what is this brane configuration ?",
    "the resolution of this puzzle is easily found if one notice that the `` size '' @xmath181 of the disc region is a fake , since in the noncommutative worldvolume it is impossible to give a notion of precise location , because of the noncommutativity .",
    "one has to move to the commutative description via the seiberg - witten map @xcite .",
    "although the sw map for the tachyon field has not been obtained ( see for example @xcite ) , from the discussion in @xcite , the natural result of the sw map for the above noncommutative soliton is a delta function .",
    "thus , the actual size of the above discs is zero .",
    "this gives an interpretation of the above soliton .",
    "a size zero d0-brane and an anti - d0-brane are located at the centers of the original d2-branes , respectively , with the separation @xmath0 .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the observation in @xcite . now",
    "the separation length between the d0-brane and the anti - d0 is enough large , this system is classically stable .",
    "if one employs another projection operator @xmath178 , then easily the brane interpretation of them can be given : each d2-brane has a tiny hole at each center .",
    "thus this classically stable solution is singular and is not relevant for the decay of the brane - antibrane .",
