    "the identification of the physical mechanisms underlying the heating of coronae of magnetically active stars to some 10100 million degrees ( mk ) remains as one of the fundamental problems of high - energy stellar astrophysics . among the non - steady heating mechanisms ,",
    "explosive release of energy by flares has received considerable attention in solar physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in particular since the statistical ensemble of flares , if extrapolated to small `` micro- '' or `` nano-''flares , may provide enough energy to explain the total coronal energy losses .",
    "there is mounting evidence that flares also play a fundamental role in coronal heating of magnetically active stars .",
    "the quiescent x - ray luminosity @xmath2 is correlated with the flare rate in x - rays @xcite and in the optical @xcite . statistically , the hotter x - ray emitting plasma component is more variable than the cooler one , indicating that flares may be involved @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the flare frequency in magnetically active stars as a function of the flare energy indicate power - law distributions that may be sufficient to explain all coronal radiative losses @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanisms that transport the hot plasma into the corona are , however , less clear .",
    "a favored model in solar physics predicts that an initial release of high - energy particles ( detected by their radio or prompt optical emission , see below ) deposits energy in the cool chromosphere , inducing an overpressure that drives hot material into the corona ( `` chromospheric evaporation '' ) . as for any coronal heating mechanism ,",
    "a large density increase is predicted which should be measurable in high - resolution x - ray spectra , in particular in density - sensitive he - like triplets of and .",
    "we present novel observations of proxima centauri , the nearest star to the sun ( distance = 1.3  pc ) , with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite , providing new important evidence for frequent chromospheric evaporation .",
    "detailed models will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "proxima centauri is a dm5.5e dwarf revealing considerable coronal activity .",
    "its `` quiescent '' x - ray luminosity @xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 is similar to the sun s despite its @xmath550 times smaller surface area .",
    "it has attracted the attention of most previous x - ray observatories @xcite .    _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite observed the star on 2001 august 12 during 65  ks of exposure time . for our light curve analysis",
    ", we used the most sensitive soft x - ray detector system presently available , namely the three combined european photon imaging cameras ( epic ; @xcite ) with a total effective area of @xmath6  @xmath7 at 1  kev and @xmath8  @xmath7 at 1.5  kev ( with the medium filters inserted ) .",
    "the flares thus recorded are the weakest yet observed on an active star .",
    "to minimize ccd pile - up , the small window modes were used .",
    "background light curves were extracted from ccd fields outside the source region .",
    "the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ; @xcite ) simultaneously recorded high - resolution x - ray spectra between 0.352.5  kev , with a resolving power of @xmath9 ( fwhm ) around the lines at @xmath10   .",
    "the optical monitor ( om ; @xcite ) observed the star through its u band filter in high - time resolution mode .",
    "all data were analyzed using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas versions 5.3 and 5.3.3 ) .",
    "relevant extracts of the observations are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the first 45  ks of the observation reveal low - level emission around @xmath11  erg  s@xmath4 ( 0.15 - 10  kev ) .",
    "thanks to the high sensitivity , much of the emission is resolved into a succession of weak x - ray flares ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the smallest discernible events show @xmath12  erg  s@xmath4 and an integrated x - ray energy loss of @xmath13  erg , corresponding to modest solar flares .",
    "most importantly , many ( although not all ) of these flares are preceded by a short pulse in the optical u band ( figure 1 ) .",
    "a large flare monitored almost in its entirety governed the final 20  ks of the observation , with a peak @xmath14  erg  s@xmath4 and @xmath15  erg ( figure 2 ) .",
    "due to pile - up in the mos detectors , we used only the pn data for the light curve analysis of this flare .",
    "again , a large optical burst accompanies the x - ray flare during its increase .",
    "the figure also shows spectral extracts of the he - like triplets of and referring to different phases of the large flare .",
    "the line flux ratios are clearly variable , an aspect that will be discussed in detail below .",
    "we now seek an interpretation within the evaporation scenario . during a flare ,",
    "high - energy electrons are thought to be accelerated in the corona from where they travel toward the magnetic footpoints in the chromosphere .",
    "they induce a prompt signal in the optical u band ( 3000 - 4000   ) , probably owing to balmer emission or blackbody radiation , or both @xcite .",
    "their bulk kinetic energy heats the chromospheric gas to several mk , building up a pressure gradient that drives the hot plasma into the corona , thus increasing the coronal density and the soft x - ray emission .",
    "since the optical signal @xmath16 approximately traces the rate of energy deposited by the electrons @xcite , and the x - ray losses @xmath2 are a measure of the accumulated coronal thermal energy , the time integral of the optical signal should resemble the x - ray light curve , @xmath17 where the integration starts at a point in time preceding the flare ( @xmath18 ) . in other words ,",
    "the time derivative of the x - ray light curve should mimic the optical signal : @xmath19 equation  [ eq1 ] is appropriate for testing faint signals , whereas equation  [ eq2 ] requires strong signals but is sensitive to details in the light curves .",
    "this important diagnostic has been observed in the solar corona , known as the neupert effect ( using radio or hard x - ray emissions instead of u band radiation ; @xcite ) , but has rarely been detected in stellar observations , especially in low - level emissions @xcite , presumably owing to the limited sensitivity of previous x - ray devices .",
    "qualitative evidence is seen in some strong flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that each of our optical signals is the equivalent of an impulsive burst , while the associated x - ray flares are the signatures of the subsequent chromospheric evaporation .",
    "a surprising aspect is the high repetition rate of such processes in proxima centauri .",
    "while hot plasma is accumulated in the corona , the x - ray emission of any plasma packet decays nearly exponentially due to cooling .",
    "equation 1 in this form does not consider cooling ; we therefore include a decay term by convolving the optical light curve with a cut - off exponential decay profile ( @xmath20 for @xmath21 and zero for @xmath22 ) .",
    "a decay time of @xmath23  s is found to be appropriate , and the convolution is shown by the thick solid curves in figures 1a - f .",
    "after the convolution , a high level of correlation with the x - rays reveals itself in many coincident peaks and similar light curve shapes ( figures 1a , b ) .",
    "suggestive examples are marked by vertical dotted lines .",
    "the optical light curve often predicts the subsequent x - ray behavior , revealing an intimate connection between the two emissions .",
    "the correlation holds even for some flare groups ( figures 1c , d ) . in some cases ,",
    "the detailed correlation is poor although optical flare groups cluster during x - ray flux increases ( figures 1e , f ) .",
    "the large flare allowed us to compute its time derivative ( figure 2b ) .",
    "it traces the optical signal closely until after the optical flare peak , when uncorrelated cooling mechanisms take over .",
    "here , @xmath24 was not considered as it appears that ongoing heating on time scales longer than @xmath24 dominates over cooling .",
    "the x - ray flux @xmath25 from a collisional plasma is proportional to the volume emission measure ( em ) , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electron density , @xmath28 is the hydrogen ( or proton ) density , and @xmath29 is the source volume element ; the proportionality constant is the line emissivity @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath30 and @xmath27 from fluxes alone is therefore a degenerate problem",
    ". it can be circumvented by using the he - like spectral line triplets as a diagnostic for @xmath27 .",
    "the relevant triplets of the and ions are each formed by radiative decays to the ground state , namely the resonance transition @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , the intercombination transition @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and the forbidden transition @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . in cool stars with negligible ultraviolet continuum radiation ,",
    "the flux ratio @xmath37 is sensitive to @xmath27 because electron collisions can excite the @xmath38 to the @xmath39 state before the former decays radiatively @xcite .",
    "the data reveal strong variations of @xmath40 along the flare ( examples in figure 2c ) .",
    "the characteristic @xmath27 derived from reaches @xmath41  @xmath1 during the flux maxima , but is much lower ( @xmath42  @xmath1 ) during the decays ( crosses in figure 2a ) .",
    "previous attempts to estimate stellar coronal flare densities spectroscopically used lines in the extreme ultraviolet range , but density variations were difficult to constrain ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a marginal x - ray result , see @xcite ) . qualitatively similar variations are seen in the triplet ( figure 2c ) , although blends of the @xmath33 line thwart a precise quantitative interpretation .",
    "the strongly variable @xmath35 line alone suggests that plasma around 45  mk ( the maximum formation temperature of ) attained densities across the density sensitivity range of this triplet , @xmath43  @xmath1 @xcite .    to derive the associated em , we measured the total flux @xmath44 of the lines used above .",
    "we found that @xmath44 is nearly proportional to the 0.1510  kev epic count rate .",
    "this is important because lines are efficiently formed only in a temperature range of @xmath45  mk .",
    "we conclude that variations of the em - weighted formation temperature of these lines are not the dominant factor for the variability of @xmath44 .",
    "the ratio @xmath46 provides an independent test since it is a temperature indicator for the line - forming plasma @xcite .",
    "we infer characteristic temperatures , @xmath47  mk , that cluster around the maximum formation temperature ( @xmath48  mk ) but do not show a clear correlation with @xmath44 .",
    "we will therefore approximate the emitting plasma as being isothermal at @xmath49 ; systematic errors thus introduced for the em are no larger than a factor of @xmath52 ( see tables in @xcite ) .",
    "for a homogeneous source at @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , @xmath51 , and the total mass @xmath52 involved is @xmath53 .",
    "we used emissivities from @xcite referring to solar photospheric composition . from spectral fits in xspec @xcite",
    ", we found an abundance of oxygen of @xmath54 times the solar photospheric value @xcite .",
    "for the primary peak , its decay , the secondary peak , and its decay , the masses of emitting plasma thus amount to @xmath55  g , @xmath56  g , @xmath57  g , and @xmath58  g , respectively , while @xmath59  @xmath60 , @xmath61  @xmath60 , @xmath62  @xmath60 , and @xmath63  @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the potential energy of a @xmath64  g plasma packet at a height of @xmath65  km ( the pressure scale height at @xmath66  k for a radius of @xmath67  cm and a stellar mass of 0.2@xmath68 , see @xcite and references therein ) is @xmath69  erg .",
    "this compares with the total thermal energy content of the same plasma , @xmath70  erg , while the total radiated x - ray energy from the cooler plasma component at 0.2 kev ( determined from a spectral fit ) is approximately @xmath71  erg during the complete flare ( using a peak em of @xmath72  @xmath1 , a decay time of 4300  s , and a cooling loss rate of @xmath73  erg  s@xmath4@xmath60 ) , necessitating considerable replenishment of the cool material during the flare .    even after consideration of the uncertainties due to variations of @xmath74 ,",
    "it is clear that densities , masses and volumes of the plasma accessible by increase during the flare .",
    "coronal density increases are a consequence of any heating mechanism in closed loops .",
    "it is the preceding optical impulsive emission that strongly supports chromospheric evaporation induced by electron beams .",
    "solar white - light flares are closely correlated in time with hard x - ray bursts , suggesting that this phase relates to electron bombardment of the chromosphere @xcite , while soft x - rays and higher densities are evolving more gradually .",
    "since plasma cooling becomes important early in the flare development , the relatively cool emitting plasma component is not only augmented due to heating of chromospheric material , but also due to cooling of hotter material that has initially reached temperatures beyond the formation range of lines , hence the continuous increase of masses and volumes during the decay .",
    "the low flux of the weaker flares and their strong mutual overlap prohibit individual density measurements , but integration of larger segments shows appreciable changes in @xmath40 as well , with the highest - density episode related to the segment in figure 1b ( an increase of at most a factor of ten over the average ) .",
    "furthermore , the time behavior of several optical and x - ray flares that expresses itself as a neupert effect is similar to the behavior seen in the large flare , indicating that the same processes repeat at a much higher cadence at lower energy levels such that they govern the x - ray emission most of the time .",
    "we do not find a one - to - one correspondence between all optical and x - ray flares , but this is no different on the sun @xcite .",
    "some groups of small optical flares occur , however , during a general increase of the soft x - ray light curve .",
    "the present observations suggest an important role of chromospheric evaporation in active stellar coronae .",
    "the resulting high plasma densities appear to be a critical element for the high x - ray luminosities of magnetically active stars .",
    "helpful comments by the referee are acknowledged .",
    "research at psi has been supported by the swiss national science foundation ( grant 2000 - 058827 ) .",
    "the present project is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
