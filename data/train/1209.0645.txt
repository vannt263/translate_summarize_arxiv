    "it is widely agreed that the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wds ) in binary systems .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether their companion stars ( secondaries ) are hydrogen - rich ( main sequence or giant stars , typically called ` single degenerate ' scenarios ) , helium - rich ( helium stars or helium - rich wds ) or other co  wds which merge with the primaries ( typically called ` double degenerate ' scenarios ) .",
    "@xcite analysed high - resolution spectra of 35 sne  ia , finding that more than half of the spectra exhibit a blueshifted na i d absorption feature .",
    "the authors attribute this feature to circumstellar material ( blown off of the secondary prior to the sn explosion ) , suggesting that at least 20% of sne  ia in spiral galaxies originate from single degenerate scenarios ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , several recent studies have highlighted challenges to single degenerate scenarios and have instead tended to favour double degenerate models .",
    "for example , the lack of emission associated with the supernova overrunning the companion star @xcite , the absence of radio detections @xcite and the lack of unambiguous identifications of companion stars in supernova remnants @xcite argue against models in which the companion is a red giant star at explosion ( see also * ? ? ? * where a single degenerate scenario origin for sn 2011fe is likely ruled out ) .",
    "in addition , a number of recent studies find that the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of sne  ia follows a power - law shape @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "such a distribution is expected if the progenitor population of sne  ia is dominated by double degenerates .",
    "these studies , among others , have fuelled speculation that there must be at least two different progenitor scenarios leading to sne  ia .",
    "however , the question of which channel(s ) dominate(s ) the production of ` normal ' sne  ia @xcite and determine(s ) the observed sn  ia brightness distribution remains open .    in a series of recent papers @xcite , a new explosion model for sne  ia produced by double degenerate ( co+co  wds ) mergers was investigated . in this violent merger model , a prompt",
    "detonation is triggered during the merger itself , leading to a thermonuclear explosion of the system .",
    "although it is not yet established which parameters of the merging system are most crucial for the formation of such a detonation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , synthetic spectra and light - curves computed for several realisations of the violent merger scenario are a good match to maximum light observations of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the level of agreement with observations is comparable to that found for other scenarios @xcite .",
    "in contrast to chandrasekhar mass explosion models , where the peak brightness is driven by stochastic processes connected to the formation of deflagration and detonation flames or other properties of the exploding chandrasekhar mass wd ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the violent merger scenario there is a direct correlation between fundamental parameters of the progenitor system and the sn luminosity . specifically , to first order , the violent merger model can be interpreted as a mechanism to ignite a detonation of a sub - chandrasekhar - mass wd ( the primary co  wd ) as described in @xcite",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although the merging secondary wd is also consumed by the thermonuclear flame of the detonation , it does not produce any iron group elements when it is burned .",
    "thus , the absolute brightness of a sn  ia explosion depends on the mass of the primary co  wd .    the brightness distribution of sne  ia can be observed directly , with a typical peak brightness of @xmath10  mag @xcite and a spread in brightness of @xmath11  mag .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the brightness distribution of a volume - limited sample of sne  ia . any theoretical scenario explaining sne  ia that claims to account for",
    "a large fraction of observed events must be able to reproduce the observed brightness distribution .",
    "the goal of this paper is to quantify the brightness distribution of sne  ia from the violent merger scenario .",
    "our study requires three main inputs .",
    "first , we need predictions of the distribution of properties of merging co+co  wd pairs .",
    "these we obtain from previously published startrack @xcite binary population synthesis models , which are described in section  [ sec : bps ] .",
    "second , we must consider which characteristics of a merging system will be required for the explosion mechanism to work .",
    "this specification will be made based on the mass ratio of the merging system , as described in section  [ sec : qc ] .",
    "third , we need to estimate the brightness of an explosion based on the properties of the merging wds .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ sec : bright ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present our results based on the standard model used for the double degenerate scenario ( dds ) in @xcite and comment on the comparison with observations .",
    "we discuss important implications and uncertainties of our modelling in section  [ sec : discuss ] before drawing conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the population synthesis calculation results from the standard model of @xcite , whose data were obtained with the startrack population synthesis binary evolution code . in this subsection , we briefly explain how stellar mass loss / gain is handled over the course of binary evolution in startrack",
    ".    _ unstable mass transfer .",
    "_ outside densely populated environments  such as the cores of globular clusters  binary stars that form close double wds must undergo at least one common envelope ( ce ) phase @xcite , in which the size of the binary orbit decreases ( often significantly ) upon expulsion of the mass - losing star s envelope .",
    "currently , ce ejection remains a poorly understood process in astrophysics .",
    "observationally , it is difficult to study since it is a short - lived evolutionary phase and detailed theoretical modelling is extremely challenging given the large spatial and temporal scales that must be taken into account to properly approach the problem @xcite .",
    "however , despite our collective ignorance , the ce phase can not be ignored in binary evolution modelling , and so a simplified parametrization of the ce phase is often employed in binary population synthesis codes .    in the standard model of @xcite , the ce parametrization @xmath12 was used . in this ce parametrization , often coined the ` energy formalism ' @xcite , it is assumed that the binary can expel the envelope without merging if the binding energy of the mass - losing star s envelope is not greater than the orbital energy of the binary with some efficiency factor @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "presently , sufficiently detailed simulations to determine how @xmath79 will depend on primary mass have not been carried out .",
    "therefore , in this study , we will adopt a simple parametrization of @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a parameter that we will use to explore how @xmath83 influences our findings .",
    "ideally , synthetic observables for a suite of three - dimensional wd merger models would be used to determine the relationship between the system parameters and the explosion brightness .",
    "unfortunately , such simulations are too computationally expensive for this to be practical in this study .",
    "however , as argued in section  [ sec : intro ] , the peak brightness of a prompt detonation merger model is directly related to the mass of the more massive wd ( @xmath26 ) ; in the merger , the @xmath0ni is mostly synthesized in the detonation of the primary .",
    "we therefore estimate the brightness of a merger from a simple one - dimensional model for a detonation of a wd with mass equal to that of the primary .",
    "to quantify the relationship between the primary mass and the peak bolometric magnitude ( @xmath2 ) , we carried out a series of simulations for detonations of single co  wds with a range of wd masses ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "we constructed hydrostatic models for co  wds and simulated detonations of these wds using our sn  ia explosion code . in all cases ,",

    "[ fig : sbirr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : esa ] , respectively . from the figures , it is clear that the shapes of our theoretical brightness distributions ( coloured lines ) do not change very much as a function of age .",
    "additionally , using a different time cut does not change the results much either , since both bright and dim violent mergers occur at early and late delay times ( see sect .",

    "we additionally compare our theoretical distributions to the two luminosity functions of @xcite that are separated by hubble type .",

    "( 2011 ) sample , it is reasonable to assume that the average delay times for sne ia found among the group with elliptical galaxies will be larger than the average delay times for sne ia found in the group which contains irregular galaxies .",
    "this is reflected in the slightly higher proportion of low - luminosity events to high - luminosity events in fig .",
    "[ fig : esa ] compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : sbirr ] ( greyscales ) . the @xcite sample ( both age groups )",
    "contains sne with different spectral properties , and we have included all 74 objects regardless of their spectral classification ( normal , high - velocity , 91t - like , 91bg - like , and 02cx - like ) .",
    "we note finally that the comparison of the theoretical brightness distributions to the observational data is for illustrative purposes only , since an accurate comparison requires detailed information on the observed delay time distribution from the @xcite sample .",
    "furthermore , splitting the entire @xcite sample as we have done increases statistical noise : some bins only contain one sn event ( see fig .  5 of li et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) . despite these potential caveats ,",
    "the overall distribution shapes ( observed and theoretical ) show similar trends , and compare relatively well .",
    "in any case , it is possible ( even likely ) that other formation channels and/or explosion mechanisms are also contributing at some level to the sn ia population at early and/or late delay times ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ."
