    "shape - anisotropic multiferroic nanomagnets , consisting of magnetostrictive layers elastically coupled with piezoelectric layers  @xcite , have emerged as attractive storage and switching elements for non - volatile memory and logic systems since they are potentially very energy - efficient .",
    "their magnetizations can be switched in less than 1 nanosecond with energy dissipation less than 1 aj , when no thermal noise is present  @xcite .",
    "this has led to multiple logic proposals incorporating these systems  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of the magnet has two ( mutually anti - parallel ) stable states along the easy axis that encode the binary bits 0 and 1 .",
    "the magnetization is flipped from one stable state to the other by applying a tiny voltage of few tens of millivolts across the piezoelectric layer while constraining the magnetostrictive layer from expanding or contracting along its in - plane hard - axis .",
    "the voltage generates a strain in the piezoelectric layer , which is then transferred to the magnetostrictive layer . that produces a uniaxial stress in the magnetostrictive layer along its easy - axis and rotates the magnetization towards the in - plane hard axis as long as the product of the stress and the magnetostrictive coefficient is _",

    "the dynamics is governed by the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation  @xcite that describes the time - evolution of the magnetization vector s orientation under various torques .",
    "there are _ three _ torques to consider here : torque due to shape anisotropy , torque due to stress , and the torque associated with random thermal fluctuations .",
    "with realistic ramp rates ( rate at which stress on the magnet is ramped up or down ) a magnet can be switched with @xmath1100% probability with a ( thermally averaged ) switching delay of @xmath10.5 ns and ( thermally averaged ) energy dissipation @xmath1200 @xmath2 at room - temperature .",
    "this is very promising for `` beyond - moore s law '' ultra - low - energy computing  @xcite .",
    "our simulation results show the following : ( 1 ) a fast ramp and a sufficiently high stress are required to switch the magnet with high probability in the presence of thermal noise , ( 2 ) the stress needed to switch with a given probability increases with decreasing ramp rate , ( 3 ) if the ramp rate is too slow , then the switching probability may never approach 100% no matter how much stress is applied , ( 4 ) the switching probability increases monotonically with stress and saturates at @xmath1100% when the ramp is fast , but exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on stress when the ramp is slow , and ( 5 ) the thermal averages of the switching delay and energy dissipation are nearly independent of the ramp rate if we always switch with the critical stress , which is the minimum value of stress needed to switch with non - zero probability in the presence of noise .",

    "the torque on the magnetization vector due to shape and stress anisotropy vanishes when @xmath59 [ see equation ( [ eq : stress_torque ] ) ] , i.e. when the magnetization vector is aligned along the easy axis .",
    "that is why @xmath22 are called _",

    "consider the situation when @xmath60 .",
    "we get : @xmath61 @xmath62 we can see clearly from the above equation that thermal torque can deflect the magnetization from the easy axis since the time rate of change of @xmath11 [ i.e. , @xmath63 is non - zero in the presence of the thermal field .",
    "note that the initial deflection from the easy axis due to the thermal torque does not depend on the component of the random thermal field along the @xmath5-axis , i.e. , @xmath41 , which is a consequence of having @xmath64@xmath5-axis as the easy axes of the nanomagnet .",
    "however , once the magnetization direction is even slightly deflected from the easy axis , all three components of the random thermal field along the @xmath9- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-direction would come into play and affect the deflection .",
    "the thermal distributions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the unstressed magnet are found by solving the equations ( [ eq : theta_dynamics ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_dynamics ] ) while setting @xmath67 = 0 .",
    "this will yield the distribution of the magnetization vector s initial orientation when stress is turned on .",
    "the @xmath65-distribution is boltzmann peaked at @xmath65 = 0@xmath68 or 180@xmath68 , while the @xmath66-distribution is gaussian peaked at @xmath23 ( ref .",
    "[ ] ) . since the most probable value of @xmath65 is either 0@xmath68 or 180@xmath68 , where stress is ineffective ( _ stagnation point _ ) , there are long tails in the switching delay distribution .",
    "they are due to the fact that when we start out from @xmath22 , we have to wait a while before thermal kick sets the switching in motion .",
    "thus , switching trajectories initiating from a stagnation point are very slow  @xcite .    in order to eliminate the long tails in the switching delay distribution and thus decrease the mean switching delay",
    ", one can apply a small static bias magnetic field that will shift the peak of @xmath69 distribution away from the easy axis , so that the most probable starting orientation will no longer be a stagnation point .",
    "this field is applied along the out - of - plane hard axis ( + @xmath9-direction ) so that the potential energy due to the applied magnetic field becomes @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the magnitude of magnetic field .",
    "the torque generated due to this field is @xmath72 .",
    "the presence of this field will modify equations   and   to @xmath73 @xmath74    the bias field also makes the potential energy profile of the magnet asymmetric in @xmath66-space and the energy minimum will be shifted from @xmath75 ( the plane of the magnet ) to @xmath76 however , the profile will remain symmetric in @xmath65-space , with @xmath77 and @xmath60 remaining as the minimum energy locations . with the parameters used in this paper , a bias magnetic field of flux density 40 mt",
    "would make @xmath78 .",
    "application of the bias magnetic field will also reduce the in - plane shape anisotropy energy barrier from 44 @xmath2 to 36 @xmath2 at room temperature .",
    "we assume that a permanent magnet will be employed to produce the bias field and thus will not affect the energy dissipated during switching .",
    "the energy dissipated during switching has two components : ( 1 ) the energy dissipated in the switching circuit that applies the stress on the nanomagnet by generating a voltage , and ( 2 ) the energy dissipated internally in the nanomagnet because of gilbert damping .",
    "we will term the first component ` @xmath79 ' dissipation , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the capacitance of the piezoelectric layer and the applied voltage , respectively . if the voltage is turned on or off abruptly ,",
    "i.e. the ramp rate is infinite , then the energy dissipated during either turn on or turn off is @xmath82 .",
    "however , if the ramp rate is finite , then this energy is reduced and its exact value will depend on the ramp duration or ramp rate .",
    "we calculate it following the same procedure described in ref .",
    "the second component , which is the internal energy dissipation @xmath83 , is given by the expression @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the switching delay and @xmath86 is the power dissipated during switching @xcite @xmath87 we sum up the power @xmath86 dissipated during the entire switching period to get the corresponding energy dissipation @xmath83 and add that to the ` @xmath79 ' dissipation in the switching circuit to find the total dissipation @xmath88 .",
    "the average power dissipated during switching is simply @xmath89 .",
    "there is no net dissipation due to random thermal torque since the mean of the random thermal field is zero .",
    "however , that does not mean that the temperature has no effect on either @xmath83 or the ` @xmath79 ' dissipation .",
    "it affects @xmath83 since it raises the critical stress needed to switch with non - zero probability and it also affects the stress needed to switch with a given probability .",
    "furthermore , it affects ` @xmath79 ' because @xmath81 must exceed the thermal noise voltage @xcite to prevent random switching due to noise . in other words",
    ", we must enforce @xmath90 .",
    "for the estimated capacitance of our structure ( 2.6 ff ) , this translates to @xmath91 1.3 mv .",
    "in our simulations , we consider the magnetostrictive layer to be made of polycrystalline terfenol - d that has the following material properties  young s modulus ( y ) : 8@xmath9210@xmath93 pa , magnetostrictive coefficient ( @xmath94 ) : + 90@xmath9210@xmath95 , saturation magnetization ( @xmath14 ) : 8@xmath9210@xmath96 a / m , and gilbert s damping constant ( @xmath51 ) : 0.1 ( refs .  [ ] ) . for the piezoelectric layer , we use lead - zirconate - titanate ( pzt ) , which has a dielectric constant of 1000 .",
    "the pzt layer is assumed to be four times thicker than the magnetostrictive layer so that any strain generated in it is transferred almost completely to the magnetostrictive layer  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the maximum strain that can be generated in the pzt layer is 500 ppm @xcite , which would require a voltage of 111 mv because @xmath3=1.8@xmath9210@xmath97 m / v for pzt @xcite .",
    "the corresponding stress is the product of the generated strain ( @xmath98 ) and the young s modulus of the magnetostrictive layer .",
    "hence , 40 mpa is the maximum magnitude of stress that can be generated on the nanomagnet .",
    "we assume that when stress is applied to initiate switching , the magnetization vector starts out from near the south pole ( @xmath99 ) with a certain ( @xmath69,@xmath100 ) picked from the initial angle distributions at the given temperature .",
    "stress is ramped up linearly and kept constant until the magnetization reaches the plane defined by the in - plane and the out - of - plane hard axis ( i.e. the @xmath9-@xmath4 plane , @xmath101 ) .",
    "this plane is always reached sooner or later since the energy minimum of the stressed magnet in @xmath65-space is at @xmath21 .",
    "thermal fluctuations can introduce a spread in the time it takes to reach the @xmath9-@xmath4 plane but can not prevent the magnetization from reaching it ultimately if the stress is so large that the energy minimum at @xmath21 is more than a few @xmath2 deep .",
    "as soon as the magnetization reaches the @xmath9-@xmath4 plane , the stress is ramped down at the same rate at which it was ramped up , and reversed in magnitude to facilitate switching .",
    "the magnetization dynamics ensures that @xmath65 continues to rotate towards @xmath102 with very high probability . when @xmath65 becomes @xmath103 , switching is deemed to have completed . a moderately large number ( 10,000 ) of simulations , with their corresponding ( @xmath69,@xmath100 ) picked from the initial angle distributions , are performed for each value of stress and ramp duration to generate the simulation results in this paper .",

    "regardless of the ramp rate .",
    "this happens because a higher stress mitigates the detrimental effects of thermal fluctuations more when magnetization reaches the @xmath9-@xmath4 plane and thus conducive to more success rate of switching .",

    "now , the stress initially applied to cause switching becomes harmful and impedes switching .",
    "that happens because it causes the energy minimum to be located at @xmath21 , which will make the magnetization backtrack towards this location during the second half .",
    "this is why stress must be removed or reversed immediately upon crossing the @xmath9-@xmath4 plane so that the energy minimum quickly moves back to @xmath109 , and the magnetization vector rotates towards @xmath110 . if the removal rate is fast , then the success probability remains high since the harmful stress does not stay active long enough to cause significant backtracking .",
    "however , if the ramp rate is too slow , then significant backtracking occurs whereupon the magnetization vector returns to the @xmath9-@xmath4 plane and thermal torques can subsequently kick it to the starting position at @xmath108 , causing switching failure .",

    "<S> switching the magnetization of a shape - anisotropic 2-phase multiferroic nanomagnet with voltage - generated stress is known to dissipate very little energy ( @xmath0 1 aj for a switching time of @xmath10.5 ns ) at 0 k temperature . here , we show by solving the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation that switching can be carried out with @xmath1100% probability in less than 1 ns while dissipating less than 2 aj at _ room temperature_. this makes nanomagnetic logic and memory systems , predicated on stress - induced magnetic reversal , one of the most energy - efficient computing hardware extant . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the dependence of energy dissipation , switching delay , and the critical stress needed to switch , on the rate at which stress is ramped up or down . </S>"
