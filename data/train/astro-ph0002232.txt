    "the theoretical study of the structure of neutron stars is crucial if new observations of masses and radii are to lead to effective constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter .",
    "this study becomes ever more important as laboratory studies may be on the verge of yielding evidence about the composition and stiffness of matter beyond the nuclear equilibrium density @xmath0 g @xmath1 .",
    "rhoades & ruffini ( 1974 ) demonstrated that the assumption of causality beyond a fiducial density @xmath2 sets an upper limit to the maximum mass of a neutron star : @xmath3 .",
    "however , theoretical studies of dense matter have considerable uncertainty in the high - density behavior of the eos largely because of the poorly constrained many - body interactions .",
    "these uncertainties have prevented a firm prediction of the maximum mass of a beta - stable neutron star .    to date",
    ", several accurate mass determinations of neutron stars are available from radio binary pulsars ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1998 ) , and they all lie in a narrow range ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "one neutron star in an x - ray binary , cyg x-2 , has an estimated mass of @xmath6 m@xmath5 ( orosz & kuulkers 1999 ) , but this determination is not as clean as for a radio binary .",
    "another x - ray binary , vela x-1 , has a reported mass around 1.9 m@xmath5 ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1995a ) , although stickland et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue it to be about 1.4 m@xmath5 . a third object",
    ", the eclipsing x - ray binary 4u 1700 - 37 , apparently contains an object with a mass of @xmath7 m@xmath5 ( heap & corcoran 1992 ) , but brown , weingartner & wijers ( 1996 ) have argued that since this source does not pulse and has a relatively hard x - ray spectrum , it may contain a low - mass black hole instead .",
    "it would not be surprising if neutron stars in x - ray binaries had larger masses than those in radio binaries , since the latter have presumably accreted relatively little mass since their formation .",
    "alternatively , cyg x-2 could be the first of a new and rarer population of neutron stars formed with high masses which could originate from more massive , rarer , supernovae .",
    "if the high masses for cyg x-2 or vela x-1 are confirmed , significant constraints on the equation of state would be realized .",
    "on the other hand , there is a practical , albeit theoretical , lower mass limit for neutron stars , about @xmath8 m@xmath5 , which follows from the minimum mass of a protoneutron star .",
    "this is estimated by examining a lepton - rich configuration with a low - entropy inner core of @xmath9 m@xmath5 and a high - entropy envelope ( goussard , haensel & zdunik 1998 ) .",
    "this argument is in general agreement with the theoretical result of supernova calculations , in which the inner homologous collapsing core material comprises at least 1 m@xmath5 .",
    "although accurate masses of several neutron stars are available , a precise measurement of the radius does not yet exist .",
    "lattimer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ( see also glendenning 1992 ) have shown that the causality constraint can be used to set a lower limit to the radius : @xmath10 .",
    "for a 1.4 m@xmath5 star , this is about 4.5 km .",
    "estimates of neutron star radii from observations have given a wide range of results .",
    "perhaps the most reliable estimates stem from observations of thermal emissions from neutron star surfaces , which yield values of the so - called `` radiation radius '' @xmath11 a quantity resulting from redshifting the stars luminosity and temperature .",
    "a given value of @xmath12 implies that @xmath13 and @xmath14 m@xmath5 .",
    "thus , a 1.4 m@xmath5 neutron star requires @xmath15 km .",
    "those pulsars with at least some suspected thermal radiation generically yield effective values of @xmath12 so small that it is believed that a significant part of the radiation originates from polar hot spots rather than from the surface as a whole .",
    "for example , golden & shearer ( 1999 ) found that upper limits to the unpulsed emission from geminga , coupled with a parallactic distance of 160 pc , yielded values of @xmath16 km for a blackbody source and @xmath17 km for a magnetized h atmosphere .",
    "similarly , schulz ( 1999 ) estimated emission radii of less than 5 km , assuming a blackbody for eight low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "other attempts to deduce a radius include analyses ( titarchuk 1994 ) of x - ray bursts from sources 4u 1705 - 44 and 4u 1820 - 30 which implied rather small values , @xmath18 km .",
    "recently , rutledge et al . ( 1999 ) found that thermal emission from neutron stars of a canonical 10 km radius was indicated by the interburst emission .",
    "however , the modeling of the photospheric expansion and touchdown on the neutron star surface requires a model dependent relationship between the color and effective temperatures .",
    "absorption lines in x - ray spectra have also been investigated ( inoue 1992 ) with a view to deducing the neutron star radius .",
    "candidates for the matter producing the absorption lines are either the accreted matter from the companion star or the products of nuclear burning in the bursts . in the former case , the most plausible element is thought to be fe , in which case the relation @xmath19 , only slightly larger than the minimum possible value based upon causality ( lattimer et al .",
    "1990 ; glendenning 1992 ) is inferred . in the latter case ,",
    "plausible candidates are ti and cr , and larger values of the radius would be obtained . in both cases ,",
    "serious difficulties remain in interpreting the large line widths , of order 100500 ev , in the @xmath20 kev line observed from many sources .",
    "a first attempt at using light curves and pulse fractions from pulsars to explore the @xmath21 relation suggested relatively large radii , of order 15 km ( page 1995 ) .",
    "however , this method , which assumed dipolar magnetic fields , was unable to satisfactorily reconcile the calculated magnitudes of the pulse fractions and the shapes of the light curves with observations .",
    "the discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) from x - ray emitting neutron stars in binaries provides a possible way of limiting neutron star masses and radii .",
    "these oscillations are manifested as quasi - periodic x - ray emissions , with frequencies ranging from tens to over 1200 hz .",
    "some qpos show multiple frequencies , in particular , two frequencies @xmath22 and @xmath23 at several hundred hz .",
    "these frequencies are not constant , but tend to both increase with time until the signal ultimately weakens and disappears . in the beat frequency model ( alpar & shaham 1985 , psaltis et al .",
    "1998 ) , the highest frequency @xmath23 is associated with the keplerian frequency @xmath24 of inhomogeneities or blobs in an accretion disc . the largest such frequency measured to date is @xmath25 hz .",
    "however , general relativity predicts the existence of a maximum orbital frequency , since the inner edge of an accretion disc must remain outside of the innermost stable circular orbit , located at a radius of @xmath26 in the absence of rotation .",
    "this corresponds to a keplerian orbital frequency of @xmath27 if the star is non - rotating .",
    "equating @xmath28 with @xmath29 , and since @xmath30 , one deduces @xmath31 corrections due to stellar rotation are straightforward to deduce and produce small changes in these limits ( psaltis et al .",
    "the lower frequency @xmath22 is associated with a beat frequency between @xmath23 and the spin frequency of the star .",
    "this spin frequency is large enough , of order 250 - 350 hz , to alter the metric from a schwarzschild geometry , and increases the theoretical mass limit in equation ( [ qpo ] ) to about 2.1 m@xmath5 ( psaltis et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this remains strictly an upper limit , however , unless further observations support the interpretation that @xmath28 is associated with orbits at precisely the innermost stable orbit .",
    "if the frequency @xmath32 is to be associated with the spin of the neutron star , it should remain constant in time .",
    "however , recent observations reveal that it changes with time in a given source .",
    "osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) proposed a model in which @xmath22 is the keplerian frequency and @xmath23 is a hybrid frequency of the keplerian oscillator under the influence of a magnetospheric coriolis force . in this model ,",
    "the frequencies are related to the neutron star spin frequency @xmath33 by @xmath34 osherovich & titarchuk argue that this relation fits the observed variations of @xmath23 and @xmath22 in several qpos . the keplerian frequency in osherovich & titarchuk s model ,",
    "being associated with the lower frequency @xmath22 , however , is at most 800 hz , leading to an upper mass limit that is nearly 3 m@xmath5 and is therefore of little practical use to limit either the star s mass or radius .",
    "an alternative model , proposed by stella & vietri ( 1999 ) , associates @xmath23 with the keplerian frequency of the inner edge of the disc , @xmath24 , and @xmath32 with the precession frequency of the periastron of slightly eccentric orbiting blobs at radius @xmath35 in the accretion disc . in a schwarzschild geometry ,",
    "note that @xmath37 is the timescale that an orbiting blob recovers its original orientation relative to the neutron star and the earth , so that variations in flux are expected to be observed at both frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath38 .",
    "presumably , even eccentricities of order @xmath39 lead to observable effects .",
    "this model predicts that @xmath40 a relation that depends only upon @xmath41 .",
    "equation  ( [ sv ] ) can also fit observations of qpos , but only if @xmath42 .",
    "this result is not very sensitive to complicating effects due to stellar rotation : the lense - thirring effect and oblateness .",
    "this mechanism only depends on gravitometric effects , and may apply also to accreting black hole systems ( stella , vietri & morsink 1999 ) .",
    "prospects for a radius determination have improved in recent years with the discovery of a class of isolated , non - pulsing , neutron stars .",
    "the first of these is the nearby object rx j185635 - 3754 , initially discovered in x - rays ( walter , wolk & neuhaser 1996 ) and confirmed with the hubble space telescope ( walter & matthews 1997 ) .",
    "the observed x - rays , from the rosat satellite , are consistent with blackbody emission with an effective temperature of about 57 ev and relatively little extinction .",
    "the fortuitous location of the star , in the foreground of the r cra molecular cloud , coupled with the small levels of extinction , limits the distance to @xmath43 pc .",
    "the fact that the source is not observable in radio and its lack of variability in x - rays implies that it is not a pulsar , unlike other identified radio - silent isolated neutron stars .",
    "this gives the hope that the observed radiation is not contaminated with non - thermal emission as in the case for pulsars .",
    "the x - ray flux of rx  j185635 - 3754 , combined with a best - fit blackbody @xmath44 ev , yields @xmath45 .",
    "such a value for @xmath12 , even coupled with the maximum distance of 120 pc , is too small to be consistent with any neutron star with more than 1 m@xmath5 .",
    "but the optical flux is about a factor of 4 brighter than what is predicted by the x - ray blackbody .",
    "the reconciliation the x - ray and optical fluxes through atmosphere modeling naively implies an increase in @xmath12 of approximately @xmath46 .",
    "( this results since the x - ray flux is proportional to @xmath47 , while the optical flux is on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the spectrum and is hence proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "one seeks to enhance the predicted optical flux by 4 while keeping the x - ray flux fixed , as this is approximately equal to the total flux . )",
    "( 2000 ) determined for non - magnetized heavy element atmospheres that @xmath49 km pc@xmath50 , which is rough agreement with the above naive expectations .",
    "however , uncertainties in the atmospheric composition and the quality of the existing data precluded obtaining a more precise estimate of @xmath51 .",
    "concluded , in agreement with expectations based upon the general results of romani ( 1987 ) and rajagopal , romani & miller ( 1997 ) , that the predicted spectrum of a heavy element atmosphere , but not a light element atmosphere , was consistent with all the observations .",
    "this is in contrast to the conclusions of pavlov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , whose results for rx j185635 - 3754 implied that the observations in the optical and x - ray bands were incompatible with atmospheric modelling for both heavy element and light element non - magnetized atmospheres , unless the distance to this star is greater than the presumed maximum of 120 pc based upon the star s location in front of the r cor aus molecular cloud .",
    "future prospects for determining the radius of this neutron star are discussed in  7 .",
    "our objectives in this paper are 1 ) to demonstrate specifically how the accurate measurement of a neutron star radius would constrain the dense matter eos , and 2 ) to provide general relationships for other structural quantities , such as the moment of inertia and the binding energy , that are relatively eos - independent , and which could be used to constrain the neutron star mass and/or radius .",
    "we will examine a wide class of equations of state , including those that have extreme softening at high densities .",
    "in addition , we will examine analytic solutions to einstein s equations which shed light on the results we deduce empirically .",
    "in all cases , we will focus on non - rotating , non - magnetized neutron stars at zero temperature .",
    "lindblom ( 1992 ) had suggested that a series of mass and radius measurements would be necessary to accurately constrain the dense matter equation of state .",
    "his technique utilizes a numerical inversion of the neutron star structure equation .",
    "our results instead suggest that important constraints on the eos can be achieved with even a single radius measurement , if it is accurate enough , and that the quality of the constraint is not very sensitive to the mass .",
    "the fact that the range of accurately determined neutron star masses is so small , only about 0.2 m@xmath5 to date , further implies that important constraints can be deduced without simulaneous mass - radius measurements .",
    "of course , several measurements of neutron star masses and radii would greatly enhance the constraint on the equation of state .    in   2 ,",
    "the equations of state selected in this paper are discussed . in   3 ,",
    "the mass - radius relation for a sample of these equations of state are discussed . a quantitative relationship between the radii of normal neutron stars and the pressure of matter in the vicinity of @xmath52",
    "is empirically established and theoretically justified . in turn ,",
    "how the matter s pressure at these densities depends upon fundamental nuclear parameters is developed . in   4 , analytic solutions to the general relativistic equations of hydrostatic equilibrium are explored .",
    "these lead to useful approximations for neutron star structure and which directly correlate other observables such as moments of inertia and binding energy to the mass and radius .",
    "it is believed that the distribution of the moment of inertia inside the star is crucial in the interpretation of glitches observed in the spin down of pulsars , so that measurements of the sizes and frequencies of glitches can constrain neutron star masses and radii ( link , epstein & lattimer 1999 ) . in   5 , expressions for the fraction of moment of inertia contained within the stellar crust , as a function of mass , radius , and equation of state , are derived . in   6 , expressions for the binding energy are derived . ",
    "7 contains a summary and outlook .",
    "the composition of a neutron star chiefly depends on the nature of strong interactions , which are not well understood in dense matter .",
    "most models that have been investigated can be conveniently grouped into three broad categories : nonrelativistic potential models , relativistic field theoretical models , and relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock models . in each of these approaches ,",
    "the presence of additional softening components such as hyperons , bose condensates or quark matter , can be incorporated .",
    "details of these approaches have been further considered in lattimer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and prakash et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . a representative sample , and",
    "some general attributes , including references and typical compositions , of equations of state employed in this paper are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have used four equations of state taken from akmal & pandharipande ( 1998 ) .",
    "these are : ap1 ( the av18 potential ) , ap2 ( the av18 potential plus @xmath53 relativistic boost corrections ) , ap3 ( the av18 potential plus a three - body uix potential ) , and ap4 ( the av18 potential plus the uix potential plus the @xmath53 boost ) .",
    "three equations of state from mller & serot ( 1996 ) , labelled ms13 , correspond to different choices of the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 which determine the strength of the nonlinear vector and isovector interactions at high densities .",
    "the numerical values used are @xmath56 ; and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "six eoss from the phenomenological non - relativistic potential model of prakash , ainsworth & lattimer ( 1988 ) , labelled pal16 , were chosen , which have different choices of the symmetry energy parameter at the saturation density , its density dependence , and the bulk nuclear matter incompressibility parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the incompressibilities of pal15 were chosen to be @xmath59 or 240 mev , but pal6 has @xmath60 mev .",
    "three interactions from the field - theoretical model of glendenning & moszkowski ( 1991 ) are taken from their table ii ; in order , they are denoted gm13 .",
    "two interactions from the field - theoretical model of glendenning & schaffner - bielich ( 1999 ) correspond , in their notation , to gl78 with @xmath61 mev and tm1 with @xmath62 mev .",
    "the labels denoting the other eoss in table i are identical to those in the original references .",
    "the rationale for exploring a wide variety of eoss , even some that are relatively outdated or in which systematic improvements are performed , is two - fold .",
    "first , it provides contrasts among widely different theoretical paradigms .",
    "second , it illuminates general relationships that exist between the pressure - density relation and the macroscopic properties of the star such as the radius .",
    "for example , ap4 represents the most complete study to date of akmal & pandharipande ( 1998 ) , in which many - body and special relativistic corrections are progressively incorporated into prior models , ap13 .",
    "ap13 are included here because they represent different pressure - energy density - baryon density relations , and serve to reinforce correlations between neutron star structure and microscopic physics observed using alternative theoretical paradigms .",
    "similarly , several different parameter sets for other eoss are chosen .    in all cases , except for ps ( pandharipande & smith 1975 ) , the pressure is evaluated assuming zero temperature and beta equilibrium without trapped neutrinos .",
    "ps only contains neutrons among the baryons , there being no charged components .",
    "we chose to include this eos , despite the fact that it has been superceded by more sophisticated calculations by pandharipande and coworkers , because it represents an extreme case producing large radii neutron stars .",
    "the pressure - density relations for some of the selected eoss are shown in figure [ fig : p - rho ] .",
    "there are two general classes of equations of state .",
    "normal _ equations of state have a pressure which vanishes as the density tends to zero .",
    "second , _ self - bound _ equations of state have a pressure which vanishes at a significant finite density .",
    "the best - known example of self - bound stars results from witten s ( 1984 ) conjecture ( also see fahri & jaffe 1984 , haensel , zdunik & schaeffer 1986 , alcock & olinto 1988 , and prakash et al .",
    "1990 ) that strange quark matter is the ultimate ground state of matter . in this paper , the self - bound eoss are represented by strange - quark matter models sqm13 , using perturbative qcd and an mit - type bag model , with parameter values given in table 2 .",
    "the existence of an energy ceiling equal to the baryon mass , 939 mev , for zero pressure matter requires that the bag constant @xmath63 mev @xmath64 .",
    "this limiting value is chosen , together with zero strange quark mass and no interactions ( @xmath65 ) , for the model sqm1 .",
    "the other two models chosen , sqm2 and sqm3 , have bag constants adjusted so that their energy ceilings are also 939 mev .    for normal matter , the eos is that of an interacting nucleon gas above a transition density of 1/3 to 1/2 @xmath52 . below this density ,",
    "the ground state of matter consists of heavy nuclei in equilibrium with a neutron - rich , low - density gas of nucleons . in general , a self - consistent evaluation of the equilibrium that exists below the transition density , and",
    "the evaluation of the transition density itself , has been carried out for only a few equations of state ( e.g. , bethe , pethick & sutherland 1972 ,",
    "negele & vautherin 1974 , lattimer et al . 1985",
    "; lattimer and swesty 1990 ) .",
    "we have therefore not plotted the pressure below about 0.1 mev @xmath64 in figure [ fig : p - rho ] . for densities",
    "@xmath66 @xmath64 we employ the eos of negele & vautherin ( 1974 ) , while for densities @xmath67 @xmath64 we employ the eos of bethe , pethick & sutherland ( 1972 ) . however , for most of the purposes of this paper , the pressure in the region @xmath68 @xmath64 is not relevant as it does not significantly affect the mass - radius relation or other global aspects of the star s structure .",
    "nevertheless , the value of the transition density , and the pressure there , are important ingredients for the determination of the size of the superfluid crust of a neutron star that is believed to be involved in the phenomenon of pulsar glitches ( link , epstein & lattimer 1999 )",
    ".    there are three significant features to note in figure [ fig : p - rho ] for normal eoss .",
    "first , there is a fairly wide range of predicted pressures for beta - stable matter in the density domain @xmath69 . for",
    "the eoss displayed , the range of pressures covers about a factor of five , but this survey is by no means exhaustive . that such a wide range in pressures is found is somewhat surprising , given that each of the eoss provides acceptable fits to experimentally - determined nuclear matter properties .",
    "clearly , the extrapolation of the pressure from symmetric matter to nearly pure neutron matter is poorly constrained .",
    "second , the _ slopes _ of the pressure curves are rather similar . a polytropic index of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , is implied .",
    "third , in the density domain below @xmath72 , the pressure - density relations seem to fall into two groups .",
    "the higer pressure group is primarily composed of relativistic field - theoretical models , while the lower pressure group is primarily composed of non - relativistic potential models . as we show in   3 ,",
    "the pressure in the vicinity of @xmath52 is mostly determined by the symmetry energy properties of the eos , and it is significant that relativistic field - theoretical models generally have symmetry energies that increase proportionately to the density while potential models have much less steeply rising symmetry energies .",
    "a few of the plotted normal eoss have considerable softening at high densities , especially pal6 , gs1 , gs2 , gm3 , ps and pcl2 .",
    "pal6 has an abnormally small value of incompressibility ( @xmath60 mev ) .",
    "gs1 and gs2 have phase transitions to matter containing a kaon condensate , gm3 has a large population of hyperons appearing at high density , ps has a phase transition to a neutral pion condensate and a neutron solid , and pcl2 has a phase transition to a mixed phase containing strange quark matter .",
    "these eoss can be regarded as representative of the many suggestions of the kinds of softening that could occur at high densities .",
    "figure [ fig : m - r ] displays the mass - radius relation for cold , catalyzed matter using these eoss . the causality constraint described earlier and contours of @xmath12 are also indicated in figure [ fig : m - r ] . with the exception of model gs1 ,",
    "the eoss used to generate figure  [ fig : m - r ] result in maximum masses greater than 1.442 m@xmath5 , the limit obtained from psr 1913 + 16 . from a theoretical perspective , it appears that values of @xmath12 in the range of 1220 km are possible for normal neutron stars whose masses are greater than 1 m@xmath5 .",
    "corresponding to the two general types of eoss , there are two general classes of neutron stars . _",
    "normal _ neutron stars are configurations with zero density at the stellar surface and which have minimum masses , of about 0.1 m@xmath5 , that are primarily determined by the eos below @xmath52 . at the minimum mass ,",
    "the radii are generally in excess of 100 km .",
    "the second class of stars are the so - called _ self - bound _",
    "stars , which have finite density , but zero pressure , at their surfaces .",
    "they are represented in figure [ fig : m - r ] by strange quark matter stars ( sqm13 ) .",
    "self - bound stars have no minimum mass , unlike the case of normal neutron stars for which pure neutron matter is unbound . unlike normal neutron stars , the maximum mass self - bound stars have nearly the largest radii possible for a given eos .",
    "if the strange quark mass @xmath73 and interactions are neglected ( @xmath65 ) , the maximum mass is related to the bag constant @xmath74 in the mit - type bag model by @xmath75 .",
    "prakash et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and lattimer et al .",
    "( 1990 ) showed that the addition of a finite strange quark mass and/or interactions produces larger maximum masses .",
    "the constraint that @xmath76 m@xmath5 is thus automatically satisfied for all cases by the condition that the energy ceiling is 939 mev .",
    "in addition , models satisfying the energy ceiling constraint , with any values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , have larger radii for every mass than the case sqm1 . for the mit model , the locus of maximum masses of self - bound stars",
    "is given simply by @xmath79  ( lattimer et al .",
    "1990 ) , where @xmath80 is the schwarzschild radius , which is shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : m - r ] .",
    "strange quark stars with electrostatically supported normal - matter crusts  ( glendenning & weber 1992 ) have larger radii than those with bare surfaces . coupled with the additional constraint @xmath81 from protoneutron star models , mit - model strange quark stars can not have @xmath82 km or @xmath83 km .",
    "these values are comparable to the possible lower limits for a bose ( pion or kaon ) condensate eos .",
    "although the @xmath21 trajectories for normal stars can be strikingly different , in the mass range from 1 to 1.5 m@xmath5 or more it is usually the case that the radius has relatively little dependence upon the stellar mass .",
    "the major exceptions illustrated are the model gs1 , in which a mixed phase containing a kaon condensate appears at a relatively low density and the model pal6 which has an extremely small nuclear incompressibility ( 120 mev ) . both of these have considerable softening and a large increase in central density for @xmath84 m@xmath5 .",
    "pronounced softening , while not as dramatic , also occurs in models gs2 and pcl2 , which contain mixed phases containing a kaon condensate and strange quark matter , respectively .",
    "all other normal eoss in this figure , except ps , contain only baryons among the hadrons .    while it is generally assumed that a stiff eos implies both a large maximum mass and a large radius , many counter examples exist .",
    "for example , gm3 , ms1 and ps have relatively small maximum masses but have large radii compared to most other eoss with larger maximum masses . also , not all eoss with extreme softening have small radii for @xmath84 m@xmath5 ( e.g. , gs2 , ps ) . nonetheless , for stars with masses greater than 1 m@xmath5 , only models with a large degree of softening ( including strange quark matter configurations ) can have @xmath85 km .",
    "should the radius of a neutron star ever be accurately determined to satisfy @xmath85 km , a strong case could be made for the existence of extreme softening .    to understand the relative insensitivity of the radius to the mass for normal neutron stars , it is relevant that a newtonian polytrope with @xmath86 has the property that the stellar radius is independent of both the mass and central density .",
    "recall that most eoss , in the density range of @xmath87 , have an effective polytropic index of about one ( see figure [ fig : p - rho ] ) .",
    "an @xmath86 polytrope also has the property that the radius is proportional to the square root of the constant @xmath88 in the polytropic pressure law @xmath89 .",
    "this suggests that there might be a quantitative relation between the radius and the pressure that does not depend upon the eos at the highest densities , which determines the overall softness or stiffness ( and hence , the maximum mass ) .",
    "in fact , this conjecture may be verified .",
    "figure  [ fig : p - r ] shows the remarkable empirical correlation which exists between the radii of 1 and 1.4 m@xmath5 normal stars and the matter s pressure evaluated at fiducial densities of 1 , 1.5 and 2 @xmath52 .",
    "table  1 explains the eos symbols used in figure  [ fig : p - r ] . despite the relative insensitivity of radius to mass for a particular eos in this mass range , the nominal radius @xmath90 , which is defined as the radius at a particular mass @xmath41 in solar units , still varies widely with the eos employed . up to @xmath91 km differences",

    "<S> the structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure : the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density . in the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities , </S>",
    "<S> the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure . for equations of state with extreme softening , or those that are self - bound , </S>",
    "<S> the radius is more sensitive to the mass . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that in the absence of extreme softening , a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars , for a large class of equations of state , are nearly universal functions of the star s compactness . </S>",
