    "ppmxl was released in 2010 , after we had derived our initial membership catalog .",
    "some stars have nomad and/or ucac-3 proper motions consistent with cluster membership , but are discrepant according to the ppmxl values ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we include these stars in our membership list despite this , and we evaluate their probability of membership based on all available kinematic and photometric data (  [ s : membership ] ) .",
    "we performed initial radial velocity confirmation of suspected members to verify the existence of the cluster with the hamilton echelle spectrometer on the 120 inch shane telescope at lick observatory ( @xmath50 ; * ? ? ?",
    "our objectives were to obtain rvs of known and suspected members , to identify new members , and to obtain high resolution spectra of the brightest members at high signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) for more detailed analysis of abundances and chromospheric activity .",
    "we observed candidate cluster members on ut 2007 july 31  august 1 and 2007 august 22  23 , including the members identified by @xcite . to locate additional candidate members , we selected stars from the nomad catalog that were within @xmath51 of the published cluster center and that had ucac-2 and tycho-2 proper motions within 5 mas / yr of the @xcite value .",
    "although there are over 750,000 nomad stars in the field due to its large size and location in the galactic plane , the cluster is separated enough from the field in proper motion space that this yielded a list of 1348 stars , illustrated in figures [ f : nomad ] .    to further vet this list , we used nomad ( @xmath41 ) and 2mass ( @xmath3 ) color - magnitude diagrams to identify stars consistent with an assumed distance of 230 pc , a compromise between the hip1 distance to the cluster ( 270 pc ) and the value of @xcite ( 175 pc ) .",
    "we combined the cmds and proper motion information to estimate crude membership probabilities based on the hipparcos main sequence with no reddening corrections , calculated generously to account for uncertainties in the cluster parameters and for the poor quality of some of the nomad proper motion entries , and we favored brighter targets to improve the efficiency of vetting candidate members at the telescope .",
    "we drew from this list , sorted by membership probability , to choose targets for spectroscopic study at lick observatory .",
    "we used these spectra to measure radial velocities for the stars and determine the space motion of the cluster .",
    "we adopted the spectrograph setup procedure of the california and carnegie planet search , which placed bright emission lines from a thorium - argon ( thar ) lamp on specific pixels to approximately reproduce a known wavelength solution to a fraction of a pixel .",
    "our prior experience using the hamilton spectrograph at coud focus revealed that the wavelength solution is reliable to a pixel or two over the course of the night .",
    "this was sufficient for our purposes of measuring radial velocities to @xmath52 @xmath30 , a precision which allows most interloping field stars to be identified , so we did not attempt any further wavelength calibration throughout the night . in practice ,",
    "our radial velocity accuracy proved to be much better than 5 @xmath30 .",
    "observing conditions were good , and we obtained several high snr spectra of radial velocity standard stars of various spectral types throughout the nights , chosen from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "for candidate members we used exposure times of 60  90 s , depending on the magnitude of the star . for fainter stars we obtained snrs as low as 1 per pixel , which is sufficient for our velocity work because of the broad spectral coverage of the hamilton spectrograph .",
    "this strategy allowed a large number of stars to be observed in our allocated time for this low - declination cluster , which only spent a few hours per night at sufficiently low airmass to be useful .",
    "the raw spectra were processed with the standard hamilton spectrograph data reduction pipeline used for precise radial velocity work by the california and carnegie planet search , which includes bias subtraction and flat fielding of each frame and which results in a one - dimensional spectrum for each of 92 orders .",
    "we calculated an empirical blaze function for each order by fitting a polynomial to the spectra of several rapidly rotating b stars that we observed for this purpose .",
    "these stars show no high resolution spectral features , and we corrected orders contaminated by the effects of the broad balmer lines by averaging the polynomial blaze function of the neighboring orders .",
    "variations in slit illumination from target to target created apparent continuum variations that were not perfectly removed by this process , and the nature of the polynomial fitting process caused the fit to diverge from the actual spectrum significantly at the edges of orders .",
    "the resulting spectra were nonetheless sufficiently flat that the cross correlations required for our data analysis (  [ s : angrv ] ) could be confidently performed .",
    "we followed a similar procedure at palomar observatory to determine membership probabilities and activity measurements of fainter candidate members .",
    "target stars were drawn from the same sorted list that was compiled for the lick observing run the previous year , including 25 targets that were chosen for follow - up observations based on qualitative examination of the radial velocity measurements derived from the lick data , either because the signal - to - noise ratio of the lick data was too low for a definitive velocity measurement or the star showed evidence of binarity , necessitating a second epoch .",
    "we observed on 2008 august 5 and 18 with the east - arm echelle ( @xmath53 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the hale 200-inch at palomar , following our earlier procedure of short integrations at very low signal - to - noise ratio ( the additional aperture of the 200-in over the 3-m , somewhat mitigated by the low throughput of the east arm echelle , allowed us to explore fainter targets , or brighter targets at better snr ) .",
    "although we adopted the rough wavelength calibration used for planet search work , we did not attempt to use this calibration to measure our radial velocities .",
    "rather , we extracted radial velocities in pixel space by cross - correlating the spectra of our candidate cluster members with those of our observed rv standard stars ( a similar pixel - space cross - correlation method was employed by @xcite ) . to reduce the errors introduced by comparing two stars of different spectral types , we paired each candidate member to an rv standard star that minimized the difference between their @xmath54 colors ( @xmath55 ) , with @xmath56 for the bluest standard star and @xmath57 for the reddest .",
    "imperfect flat fielding produced a sharp spike at exactly zero shift in the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) , and the presence of telluric lines created a narrow peak there , complicating the radial velocity measurements derived from these ccfs .",
    "this justified our use of velocity standard stars as cross - correlation templates rather than high snr spectra of actual cluster members , since the standards have different radial velocities than the cluster and so the true ccf peak is far removed from the spurious peaks at zero shift . to further address the problem of telluric lines",
    ", we empirically rejected those portions of the spectrum where these lines dominated the ccf : after dividing each of the 92 orders into three segments , we discarded from all spectra those segments that showed strong telluric peaks near zero shift .    computing these ccfs for the different combinations of rv standard stars with @xmath58 allowed us to calibrate the conversion from pixel space shifts to radial velocities , after applying a barycentric radial velocity correction .",
    "this calibration step thus obviates the need for a transformation into wavelength space .",
    "specifically , we fit a linear function with zero intercept to the measured rv standard stars ccf pixel shifts as a function of the difference in their radial velocities , giving us the velocity shift per pixel in each spectrum segment .",
    "the root mean squared of the residuals of this fit is less than 0.6 @xmath30 ; this provides our best measure of the systematic velocity precision we expect at high snrs .",
    "comparison of this calibration constant among the segments confirmed that the velocity shift per pixel of the hamilton spectrograph is nearly constant for each of the 92 orders .",
    "this is not surprising given that both the resolution , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 per resolution element ) , and the sampling , @xmath61 ( pixels / resolution element ) , are nearly constant across an echellogram , and that our calibration constant , having units of @xmath30/pixel , is essentially @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the speed of light .",
    "this allowed us to add the ccfs of the remaining segments together to improve the snr of the stellar signal , and enabled the clear identification of a peak and its associated pixel shift in the combined ccf . to be conservative",
    ", we divided each spectrum into three sets of segments , corresponding to the left , middle and right sides of each order .",
    "after separately summing the ccfs in each set , we required that the location of the tallest peak in the summed ccfs to be identical in all three sets ; however , when the side segments produced noisy ccfs , as was the case for stars with snr @xmath64 , we used the location of the tallest peak in the middle segments summed ccf , as long as the peak met our high quality classification .",
    "we visually inspected each ccf produced by our procedure and classified the stars into two categories based on the quality of their ccfs : either the combined ccf had one clear peak , which corresponded to high snr spectra , or the combined ccf had multiple peaks of approximately equal height , which indicated that the ccf was dominated by noise , and which usually corresponded to spectra with snr @xmath65 per pixel ( some of these discarded stars were later revisited in the palomar observing run in order to acquire higher snr spectra ) .",
    "we found a clear clustering of barycentric velocities near 43 @xmath30 , which is within 2 @xmath30  of the cluster rv quoted by @xcite that was based on a single measurement of a single putative member (  [ s : rv ] ) . upon closer inspection of the lick velocities for signs of systematics",
    ", we found that these apparent cluster members velocities exhibited a slight correlation with time from the beginning of the observing run to the end , with magnitude 2  4 @xmath30 .",
    "we fit this trend to a linear function and removed it .",
    "we have also observed 49 of these stars with mmt / hectochelle ( with very high signal - to - noise ratio , we expect all to have rv precision @xmath660.5 @xmath30 ,  [ s : mmt ] ) , and measure differences between the lick / palomar and hectochelle rvs as large as 5 @xmath30 , except for a possible single - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb1 ) with a difference of 20 @xmath30 .",
    "we interpret this offset between telescopes and spectrographs as a measure of systematic error in our absolute barycentric radial velocities .",
    "figure [ f : rvhist ] illustrates the resulting rvs and shows a clear clustering around the cluster velocity .",

    "ideally , these sequences would be vertically offset by 0.75 magnitudes ( i.e. double the brightness ) , but for r147 , there are separations of 1 magnitude or more .",
    "this unexpected offset could be explained by differential extinction , which would widen the sequence in both directions , by a population of triple systems , or if the stars are not actually cluster members . in this preliminary investigation , we have not yet untangled this @xmath91@xmath43  multiplicity  membership degeneracy on a star by star basis , but such an analysis would improve the precision of the cluster parameters .    at @xmath8300 pc and 1@xmath15.25 in angular radius ,",

    "although the @xmath4 code does calculate two diagnostics useful for model selection , the reduced @xmath4 and a probability value , for the range of parameters we searched , the high degree of degeneracy between the four cluster parameters enabled @xmath4 to find solutions which delivered high probabilities ( @xmath11360% ) and reduced @xmath4 values all @xmath661 .",

    "we find that without additional constraints from spectroscopy or additional photometric bands , just fitting a single cmd with isochrone models yields a suite of solutions all with high @xmath4 probabilities , due to the high degree of degeneracy between age , composition , distance and visual extinction .",

    "evidently , r147 has a large binary fraction .",
    "the stellar population has encountered approximately 3 gyr of galactic gravitational tidal forces .",
    "evaporation of the lightest - mass members should proceed first , both because low mass stars are preferentially ejected in 3-body encounters , and mass segregation gives them a larger effective radius and more susceptibility to galactic tides .",
    "this process also preferentially ejects single stars from the cluster , as multiple star systems of similar spectral type have a greater bound mass",
    ". the ongoing dynamical evolution of an open cluster thus tends to increase the binary fraction , and we may be seeing this effect in the r147 main sequence .    our membership list is top heavy , dominated by f stars ( dwarfs , msto and subgiants ) and red giants , with fewer numbers of g dwarfs , and only a handful of early k dwarfs .",
    "this dynamical evolution and evaporation could also explain the paucity of low mass members , and perhaps if any are left , they exist predominantly in multiples . but this can also be explained by observational bias : the nomad and ucac-3 proper motion errors increase for the fainter members .",
    "these stars also begin to blend into the galactic background in the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams , further complicating candidate identification .",
    "we are currently conducting a radial velocity survey for lower mass members , but this question will only finally be settled by deriving precise proper motions for the faint stars in the r147 field , which we intend to do by re - imaging the cluster with megacam in the near future .    if we are able to identify single m dwarfs , these will be the only old ( @xmath1131 gyr ) , single cool dwarfs with known ages and compositions bright enough to admit close spectroscopic study .",
    "once the white dwarf population is identified , it will provide an independent age estimate for the cluster and inform studies of white dwarf cooling curves . at 300 pc ,",

    "<S> we have conducted a radial velocity survey of astrometric candidates with lick , palomar , and mmt observatories and have identified over 100 members , including 5 blue stragglers , 11 red giants , and 5 double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the cluster metallicity from spectroscopic analysis , using spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) , and find it to be [ m / h ] = @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained deep cfht / megacam @xmath1  photometry and fit padova isochrones to the ( @xmath2 ) and 2mass ( @xmath3 ) cmds , using the @xmath4 maximum - likelihood procedure of @xcite , and an alternative method using 2d cross - correlations developed in this work . </S>",
    "<S> we find best fits for isochrones at age @xmath5 gyr , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , with additional uncertainty from the unresolved binary population and possibility of differential extinction across this large cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred age is heavily dependent by our choice of stellar evolution model : fitting dartmouth and parsec models yield age parameters of 3 gyr and 3.25 gyr respectively . at @xmath8300 pc and @xmath83 gyr </S>",
    "<S> , ruprecht 147 is by far the oldest nearby star cluster . </S>"
