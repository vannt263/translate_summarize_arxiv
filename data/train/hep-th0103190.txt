    "the invariance of the module @xmath92 under the gauge spin hamiltonian @xmath95 and eq .",
    "imply that the finite - dimensional module @xmath120 is invariant under the physical spin hamiltonian @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , any quadratic combination @xmath87 of the form   leads to a ( quasi-)exactly solvable spin many - body potential   ( provided of course that the module @xmath122 is not trivial ) . in particular , if the coefficient @xmath98 vanishes , the spin hamiltonian @xmath121 with potential   is exactly solvable , since it leaves invariant the infinite chains of finite - dimensional modules @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath38 .    our goal is to obtain a complete classification of the ( q)es spin potentials of the form  . the key observation used to perform this classification is the fact that different gauge spin hamiltonians @xmath95 may yield the same physical potential .",

    "we present in this section the complete classification of all the ( q)es spin calogero  sutherland models that can be constructed applying the procedure described in the previous sections . to further simplify the classification",
    ", we note that the scaling @xmath140 induces the mapping @xmath141 of the corresponding potentials . for this reason , in cases 27 we shall only list the potential for a suitably chosen value of the parameter @xmath142 .",
    "note furthermore that in cases 24 and 6 , once the potential has been computed for a positive value @xmath143 of the parameter @xmath142 , its counterpart for the opposite value @xmath144 can be immediately obtained using , namely @xmath145    for the models constructed to be symmetric under the weyl group of type @xmath1 spanned by the operators @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath148 , the change of variables @xmath149 should be an odd function of @xmath150 , since only in this case @xmath151 corresponds to @xmath152 . in all cases except the second one , this has essentially the effect of fixing the arbitrary constants on which the change of variables depends .",
    "for example , in case 7 with @xmath153 the change of variables is of the form @xmath154 , @xmath155 . imposing that @xmath156 be an odd function of @xmath119 for all @xmath157 and using the identity @xmath158 we obtain the condition @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath161 since @xmath162 , symmetry under exchange of the particles requires that @xmath163 be independent of @xmath157 , so that @xmath164 for all @xmath23 . taking into account that both the potential @xmath115 and the gauge function @xmath112 are even functions of @xmath165 by eqs .   , we see that the change of variables in this case can be taken as @xmath166 , @xmath155 .    in the classification that follows ,",
    "we have routinely discarded constant operators of the form @xmath167 this is justified , since the operator @xmath168 commutes with @xmath79 ( it actually commutes with @xmath14 , @xmath59 , @xmath10 , and @xmath60 for @xmath169 ) and therefore preserves the spaces @xmath123 and @xmath170 for all @xmath37 .",
    "all the potentials in the classification presented below are singular on the hyperplanes @xmath171 , @xmath148 , where they diverge as @xmath172 . in some cases there",
    "may be other singular hyperplanes , near which the potential behaves as the inverse squared distance to the hyperplane .",
    "we shall accordingly choose as domain of the functions in the hilbert space of the system a maximal open subset @xmath173 of the open set @xmath174 containing no singularities of the potential .",
    "in all cases except case 2b , we shall take as boundary conditions defining the eigenfunctions of @xmath121 their square integrability on the region @xmath173 and their vanishing on the boundary @xmath175 of @xmath173 faster than the square root of the distance to the boundary .",
    "since the algebraic eigenfunctions that we shall construct are in all cases regular inside @xmath173 , when this set is bounded the square integrability of the algebraic eigenfunctions on @xmath173 is an automatic consequence of their vanishing on @xmath175 . in case 2b , the potential is regular and periodic in each coordinate in an unbounded domain .",
    "therefore the square integrability of the eigenfunctions should be replaced by a bloch - type boundary condition in this case .",
    "for each of the potentials in the classification , we shall list the domain chosen for its eigenfunctions and the restrictions imposed by the boundary conditions discussed above on the parameters on which the potential depends .",
    "in particular , the singularity of the potential at @xmath171 , @xmath148 , forces the parameter @xmath176 to be greater than @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , in all cases except for the second one the potential is also singular on the hyperplanes @xmath177 , @xmath155 , and the vanishing of the algebraic eigenfunctions on these hyperplanes as @xmath178 with @xmath179 requires that @xmath180 .",
    "the conditions @xmath181 shall therefore be understood to hold in all cases .",
    "for similar reasons , in cases 4b , 5 , and 6b we must also have @xmath182 the potential in each case will be expressed as @xmath183 where the last term , which does not contain the spin operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , can be viewed as the contribution of a scalar external field .",
