    "subdiffusion occurs in systems where mobility of particles is significantly hindered due to internal structure of the medium , as in porous media , gels or amorphous semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the subdiffusion is characterized by a time dependence of the mean square displacement of transported particle @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the subdiffusion coefficient measured in the units @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the subdiffusion parameter of a value within @xmath4 range . for @xmath5 one deals with the normal diffusion .",
    "the subdiffusion has been recently extensively studied .",
    "while the phenomenon is theoretically rather well understood , there are very few reported experimental investigations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the method of impedance spectroscopy was used to experimentally study subdiffusion in porous media such as nanopore electrode @xcite , cement @xcite , tooth enamel @xcite and gels @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis of subdiffusion impedance was presented by @xcite who used the following parabolic subdiffusion equation ( pse ) with fractional time derivative .",
    "the equation reads as @xmath6 where the riemann - liouville fractional time derivative , which is defined for @xmath7 as @xcite @xmath8 for @xmath5 eq .",
    "( [ pse ] ) converts into the normal diffusion equation .    for the initial condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dirac - delta function , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ pse ] ) ( the green s function ) has non - zero values for any @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , even for small times , a finite amount of the substance exists at very large distances from the origin , what can be interpreted as infinite propagation velocity of some of the diffusing particles . to avoid this unphysical property cattaneo derived the hyperbolic normal diffusion equation which green s function has non - zero values for finite @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the equation is based on the assumption , that the flux is delayd by time period @xmath14 with respect to the concentration gradient . for many typical systems ( as the membrane one )",
    "it is hard to observe the difference between the solutions of parabolic and hyperbolic ( sub)diffusion equations even for relatively large values of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , in some processes the non - zero parameter @xmath14 plays crucial role .",
    "the example is the diffusion in a system where boundary conditions are given by functions quickly changing in time .",
    "such a situation occurs in the electrochemical system with ( sub)diffusion impedance .",
    "as far as we know , the cattaneo equation was used to study electrochemical impedance only for a system where normal diffusion occurs @xcite , except our work @xcite where the subdiffusion impedance was considered in a system with fully absorbing wall .",
    "articles published so far mostly concentrated on homogeneous systems , however , a more complex system containing few diffusion layers was also studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical foundation for studies of subdiffusion impedance using a hyperbolic equation .",
    "we apply the hyperbolic cattaneo equation with the fractional time derivative to model the subdiffusion impedance of a homogeneous sample of finite thickness , where the boundary condition at the sample surface is assumed as linear combination of flux and concentration .",
    "we find an influence of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath14 on the final formula describing the impedance of the subdiffusive medium , particularly for high and for low ac - voltage frequency .",
    "the phenomenological derivation of cattaneo equation is based on the assumption that the flux of the particles @xmath15 is not generated by the concentration gradient instantaneously ( as in the process described by parabolic diffusion equation ) , but it is delayed in time by @xmath14 @xcite , what is reflected by the following relation @xmath16 expanding the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ndyfs ] ) into power series with respect to @xmath14 and assuming that the parameter @xmath14 is sufficiently small , one gets @xmath17 combining eq .",
    "( [ nszers ] ) with the continuity equation @xmath18 one obtains the hyperbolic normal diffusion equation @xmath19 the parabolic subdiffusion equation can be derived form continuous time random walk formalism or using the phenomenological approach . in the letter case one",
    "sets the riemann - liouville fractional time derivative of the order @xmath20 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ndyfs ] ) ( with @xmath21 ) or replaces the time derivative of the first order in eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) to caputo fractional time derivative of the order @xmath3 . in similar way",
    "one can obtain the hyperbolic subdiffusion equation . in the paper @xcite",
    "there were proposed three possible generalizations of the cattaneo equation ( [ rowcatt ] ) to the one with the fractional time derivative , each one supported by a different scheme . in each of them the fractional time derivative replaces the derivative of natural order in eqs ( [ nszers ] ) or ( [ ce ] ) , or it is added to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ndyfs ] ) .",
    "the schemes provide a different forms of hyperbolic subdiffusion equation , which are not equivalent of each other . in the next section we use the last scheme - which is the most natural in our opinion - to derive the hyperbolic subdiffusion equation .",
    "thus , the generalized fick equation is given by @xmath22 equation ( [ dyfs ] ) ensures that changes of the flux due to the concentration gradient are delayed by the time @xmath14 .",
    "assuming that @xmath23 and keeping linear terms with respect to @xmath14 in the series expansion of l.h.s .",
    "( [ dyfs ] ) , we get @xmath24 combining eq .",
    "( [ szers ] ) with the continuity equation ( [ ce ] ) , we obtain the generalized cattaneo equation @xmath25",

    "we assume that the boundary condition at @xmath38 is given in a general form and it is a linear combination of the flux and concentration , where the flux is delayed in time by @xmath14 with respect to the concentration .",

    "a plot of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance in the complex plane @xmath51 as the frequency ( treated as a parameter ) is swept over a given range is called the nyquist plot .    the impedance of the diffusion layer is called the warburg impedance . for the layer of the infinite thickness",
    "the impedance is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the diffusion resistance . on the nyquist plot",
    "the warburg impedance is presented by the straight half line with the slop angle @xmath54 passing through the origin of coordinates . in real systems",
    "the diffusion layer has a finite thickness .",

    "when @xmath57 the size of the sample plays no role in the ion diffusion and the impedance is the warburg impedance ( [ impw ] ) .",

    "the curves with larger values of the @xmath14 parameter lie nearer the axis @xmath85 .",
    "the plots suggest that the curves for different values of @xmath14 converge into one curve for very small values of @xmath48 .",
    "for relatively large values of @xmath14 the nyquist plots show chaotic behavior , which is stronger when @xmath3 increases .",

    "@xmath72 does not dependent on @xmath14 and for all values of @xmath72 it is independent of the boundary conditions at @xmath38 . in the paper @xcite the case of @xmath97 was interpreted somewhat different , mainly as a presence of so - called ` constant phase element ' ( cpe ) in the system .    for relatively high @xmath48 and for @xmath93",
    "the nyquist plots show the ` chaotic ' and ` oscillating ' behavior , increases with increase of @xmath14 and @xmath3 parameters",
    ". the physical interpretation of this fact can be as follows .",
    "namely , the periodic changes of concentration at the surface @xmath26 generated the flux which is delayed in time by @xmath14 with respect to the concentration gradient .",
    "when the oscillations of concentration are very rapid , the flux does not keep up with concentration changes , so the additional factor contributing to the total impedance is created .",
    "the difficulties in movement of the ions increase when @xmath3 decreases causing a decrease in the flux .",

    "we observe that the plots become the linear where @xmath80 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , there are a few methods to extract the value of subdiffusion parameters from experimental data .",
    "the considerations presented in this paper show that it is possible to determine the values of parameters of the system from the nyquist plots obtained from experimental data .",
    "measuring the slope angle for high @xmath48 , one can extract the subdiffusion parameter @xmath3 according to the formulas ( [ tg1 ] ) and ( [ tg2 ] ) .",
    "such a method was used to extract the parameter @xmath3 for the lithium transport in gel electrode @xcite .",
    "the authors found that @xmath102 , it interpreted the results as subdiffusive transport of the particles inside the electrode . since @xmath103 , we deduce that the transport studied in @xcite can be described by the cattaneo equation with non - zero parameter @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , the value of slope angle is not sufficient to extract @xmath14 from experimental data . to find this parameter one should perform more detailed studies where the parameter representation of the nyquist plots is taken into considerations .    for the system described by parabolic subdiffusion equation ( [ pse ] ) one obtains @xmath104 .",
    "to achieve the situation where @xmath105 , the subdiffusion equation different from ( [ pse ] ) was involved into the model @xcite .",
    "namely , it was assumed that the subdiffusion is described by one of the following equations @xmath106 @xmath107 when both of the equations contain the riemann - liouville fractional derivative . however , physical meaning of eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) is rather unknown since they were derived only on the phenomenological way , where the time derivative of natural order was replaced by the fractional one in the continuity equation and/or in the fick s law .",
    "these equations were not derived on the base of ` microscopic ' model such as continuous time random walk formalism .",
    "we note that the eq .",
    "( [ pse ] ) is equivalent to ( [ e1 ] ) if in the latter one the riemann - liouville fractional derivative is replaced by the caputo derivative . in our paper",
    "we show that the slope @xmath105 is achieved form the model based on hyperbolic subdiffusion equation , which has clear physical interpretation .",
