    "the result of our self - consistent calculation could be used as input for an additional formalism which yields realistic pion properties . however , in the approach proposed in @xcite and similarly in @xcite , the goldstone pions are not fed back into the calculation of the quark properties .    in the present work we go beyond the quasiparticle models of @xcite .",
    "we do not only consider the poles of the rpa spectral functions but also the continuum of off - shell states . as we will see later , these states are much more important for the quark properties than the poles .",
