    "the x - ray emission of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) displays variations over a wide range of time scales .",
    "the first convincing demonstration of this phenomenon came with the _ exosat _ ` long looks ' ( lawrence  1987 ; mchardy & czerny 1987 ) .",
    "the data showed no characteristic time - scales , and the power spectral density function ( psd ) showed a ` red - noise ' shape . at the same time , it was also noticed that more luminous sources show slower variations .",
    "various methods have been used in the past in order to determine the x - ray variability amplitude of agn : determination of the ` two - folding ' time - scale ( i.e. the time - scale for the emitted flux to change by a factor of two ) , calculation of the psd amplitude at a given frequency , and estimation of the so called ` normalized excess variance ' ( , i.e. the variance of a light curve normalized by its mean squared after correcting for the experimental noise ) . in all cases",
    ", these quantities appear to anti - correlate with the source luminosity ( barr & mushotzky 1986 ; lawrence & papadakis 1993 ; green , mchardy & lehto 1993 ; nandra  1997 ; turner  1999 ; leighly 1999 ; markowitz & edelson 2001 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed anti - correlation between the x - ray variability amplitude and x - ray luminosity , , is that more luminous agn have larger black hole masses ( ) as well . in this case , as  increases , so does the size of the x - ray source , and a change of the source luminosity by a constant fraction takes relatively longer ; equivalently , variability amplitude measured at a fixed timescale should decrease with mass .",
    "the significant progress in the measurement of the black hole ( bh ) mass in the centers of nearby galaxies has made it possible to actually directly test the dependence of the x - ray variability amplitude on  in agn .",
    "the data show that  measured at a certain timescale is indeed anti - correlated with  ( lu & yu 2001 ; bian & zao 2003 ; papadakis 2004 ) .",
    "if there is an intrinsic correlation between x - ray variability and , then x - ray variability measurements could be used in order to measure the central black hole mass in these objects .",
    "this possibility has already been studied in the past .",
    "hayashida ( 1998 ) and czerny  ( 2001 ) have used the psd normalized by the square of the mean flux as a measure of the x - ray variability of a source . by calculating the ratio of the frequencies at which the psd@xmath4 has a certain value in agn and cyg x-1 , they were able to estimate the  in agn .",
    "recently , long , well - sampled  light curves have been used in order to accurately estimate the x - ray psd of agn .",
    "one of the main results from these studies has been the unambiguous detection of a characteristic ` break frequency ' , , at which the power spectrum changes its slope from a value of @xmath1 to @xmath5 above and below , respectively ( uttley  2002 ; markowitz  2003 ) .",
    "this break frequency is analogous to the high frequency break in galactic sources and should not be confused with the low frequency break , where the spectrum changes slope from @xmath5 above to @xmath6 below .",
    "this high frequency break appears to correlate well with , in the sense that @xmath7 ( markowitz  2003 ) .",
    "thus another way to estimate  is through the determination of  in the x - ray psd of a source .",
    "however , this method requires rather long , high quality data .",
    "we propose a new method to estimate  in agn , which may be used even for relatively low quality and/or short data coverage .",
    "the method is based on the use of  as a measure of their x - ray variability amplitude , and takes cyg x-1 as a reference point . using recent , archival  and  light curves of 21 agn",
    ", we estimate their , and we compare our results with  estimates which are based on other methods .",
    "we find that the accuracy of the  estimates using our new method is roughly similar to the accuracy of the estimates with well established methods like reverberation mapping .",
    "furthermore , the  estimation of an x - ray light curve is rather easy and straightforward .",
    "consequently , as long as typical agn observations performed by present day satellites ( like _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ ) detect significant variations , they can be used to estimate  and hence , using the method which we present in this work .",
    "it is possible then that the use of our method can provide  estimates for a large number of agn in the near future .",
    "the scaling of the psd with mass is most conveniently discussed after multiplying the normalized psd by the frequency @xmath8 .",
    "we assume here that the break frequency , , scales with the mass : @xmath9 , but the amplitude of the normalized psd @xmath10 part at the frequency break does not depend on mass .",
    "we specifically define this normalization at  and call it the psd amplitude ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the power spectrum normalized to the mean squared .",
    "recently , papadakis ( 2004 ) has showed that this quantity is indeed similar in a few well studied seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "let us suppose that an agn is observed for a period @xmath13 , and that the resulting light curve is binned using a bin size of @xmath0 .",
    "the excess variance of the light curve is equal to the integral of the psd ,    @xmath14    let us also suppose that @xmath15@xmath16 , where @xmath17/   and  is constant , and that  = @xmath18/ , where @xmath18 is another constant . under these assumptions ,    @xmath19    the equation above can be re - written as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath18 .",
    "( [ bhm ] ) can be used to estimate  provided the  of a source has been estimated , and @xmath22 is known . in order to determine @xmath22 , we used the results from the psd analysis of a galactic black hole candidate , namely cyg x-1 .",
    "the x - ray psd of this source has been extensively studied the last twenty years or so ( kemp et al . 1978 ; gierliski et al . 1999 ; nowak et al . 1999 ; churazov et al . 2001 ; pottschmidt et al . 2003 ) . in its low / hard state , the psd of the source can be roughly represented as a power law with a high frequency slope of @xmath1 , which breaks to a slope of @xmath5 below @xmath23 hz , and then to a slope of zero below @xmath24 hz ( nowak et al .",
    "1999 ; pottschmidt 2003 ) . assuming that eq .",
    "( [ bhm ] ) holds for cyg x-1 as well , and adopting the value of 10 m@xmath25 for its black hole mass ( nowak et al .",
    "1999 ; gierliski et al . 1999 and",
    "references therein ) , we determined the value of @xmath22 as follows .",
    "we used the results from the psd analysis of 130 _ rxte _ observations of cyg x-1 reported by pottschmidt et al .",
    "they calculated the psd for each observation and fitted them using lorentzian functions .",
    "the rxte observations cover a long period of time ( from december 1997 to july 2001 ) in which cyg x-1 was mainly in its hard state .",
    "we chose 68 observations , carefully avoiding data from soft or failed transition states .",
    "we calculated the excess variance using the relation = @xmath26 , where the lower frequency limit was chosen in such a way that it will always be higher than  in this source .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 4 ) , with = 10 m@xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 hz)@xmath29 sec , we find that @xmath22 varies between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the arithmetic mean being @xmath32 .",
    "we accept this value for the normalization constant @xmath22 in eq .",

    "the results for nls1 galaxies can be reconciled with the previous mass determination if we multiply our  nls1 estimates by a factor of 20 ( open triangles in fig .  1 ) .",
    "interestingly , when we multiply our ic5063 estimate by the same factor 20 as for other nls1 , the new value becomes very similar to  for that object .",

    "the source of the problems with ic4329a is more difficult to understand .",

    "  for the large extinction , nikolajuk ( 2004 ) finds = 3.9@xmath51 m@xmath25 , using the accretion disk method .",

    "( 2000 ) may be too small .    when we exclude ic4329a from our sample but we consider s1 mass estimates , together with the scaled nls1 and ic5063 estimates , then @xmath44/@xmath52 .",
    "this result suggests that the new method we propose for the  estimation in agn provides estimates which are consistent with the estimates based on the reverberation mapping technique or the -stellar velocity dispersion relation .",
    "in this work we propose a new method for the estimation of black hole mass in agn .",
    "the method is based on the use of the ` normalized excess variance ' , , as estimated from x - ray light ( eq .  [ rms ] ) .",
    "we find a simple expression between  and  ( eq .  4 ) , if we assume that the power spectrum in agn has a ` universal ' form : ( 1 ) there is a break frequency which scales with , ( 2 ) the psd slope above the break frequency is @xmath1 , and ( 3 ) the psd amplitude below the break frequency is roughly constant in all objects , independent of ( see section 2 ) .",
    "note that the method is applicable to @xmath40 kev light curves , as the psd may be different in other energy bands ( e.g. nandra & papadakis 2001 ; vaughan & fabian 2003 ; vaughan et al .",
    "2003 ) .    using our method on archival , and",
    ", @xmath40 kev light curves , we estimated  in 21 agn , with previously known estimates .",
    "the comparison between the new and past  estimates indicates that the method works very well for ` classical ' agn , i.e. s1 , s2 galaxies and quasars .",
    "the  values that we find with the proposed x - ray variability method are comparable to the values determined with other methods",
    ". however , there seems to be a significant disagreement for nls1 objects .",
    "their mass estimates , determined from the x - ray variability method , are significantly smaller than the  estimates which are based on other methods .",
    "the basic issue , that there is a shift in the x - ray variability amplitude of nls1 and ` classical ' agn of the same mass , was already noticed by czerny et al .",
    "furthermore , papadakis ( 2004 ) and mchardy et al . (",
    "2003 ) have showed that the break frequency  of nls1 is probably higher than the respective frequency in the power spectra of ` classical ' agn with the same black hole mass .",
    "if @xmath53 ( papadakis 2004 ) , where @xmath18 is the constant defined in section ( 2 ) , and  is the same for both classes of objects , then since @xmath21@xmath18 , we should expect that @xmath54 .",
    "if we adopt this view , then we obtain an excellent agreement between the  estimates which are based on the present x - ray variability method and the previous estimates for all objects , both ` classical ' agn and nls1s .",
    "the method we present here is based on the assumption of a ` universal ' power spectrum shape in agn . consequently , it is formally equivalent to other methods which directly use the scaling of a certain power spectrum characteristic ( like the break frequency , or a fixed psd value ) with  ( e.g. hayashida et al .",
    "1998 ; czerny et al . 2001 ; markowitz et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , as our method requires the estimation of  only , it should be applicable for many more cases than methods which require the estimation of the psd , as the latter is much more complicated .",
    "present day satellites like  and _ chandra _ will soon provide a large number of agn light curves with a typical exposure time of @xmath55  ksec .",
    "due to the low internal background of their detectors , most of these light curves should be of high signal to noise in the @xmath40  kev band .",
    "furthermore , because of their long orbital periods , light curves ( as long as @xmath56 days ) will be evenly sampled .",
    "provided that significant variations are observed , they could be used to estimate , and hence  through eq .",
    "the choice of the bin size , @xmath0 , is not crucial and should depend mainly on the average count rate .",
    "it needs to be large enough in order to minimize the effects of the experimental poisson noise , but at the same time the resulting number of the points in the light curve , @xmath34 , should also be large ( at least larger than 10 ) .",
    "the choice of the length of a single data string , @xmath57 , must satisfy the requirement @xmath58 .",
    "if  for a given object is not known in advance , this condition should be checked _ a posteriori_. for nls1 , the length should be @xmath59 times smaller than the appropriate @xmath57 value for classical agn , according to the results of the present work .",
    "apart from observational errors , the determination of the  is biased by intrinsic statistical error connected with the specific shape of the power spectrum ( vaughan et al .",
    "averaging over several independent variance measurements performed at various epochs reduces the error .",
    "if we have a single long light curve the error reduction is less efficient but can be assessed through simulations .",
    "we performed such simulations for ngc 5506 light curve ( 6 times longer than 1/ ) with many gaps , and with typical duration of a single string of @xmath60 s. systematic leak of the power from long to shorter timescales appeared to be negligible , and the intrinsic statistical scatter was @xmath61 @xmath62 , at 90 per cent confidence level .",
    "finally , we determined the constant @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ bhm ] ) assuming that  = 10 m@xmath25 for cyg x-1 .",
    "however , if a higher value of @xmath59 m@xmath25 is more appropriate for this object ( e.g. zikowski 2004 ) , then @xmath22 and the  estimates listed in table  1 should be increased by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "such a change would , however , actually introduce a discrepancy between the masses estimated from the present x - ray variability and from other methods .",
    "although the mass determination by the reverberation method may also contain a systematical error of the order of a factor @xmath23 ( see krolik 2001 ) , this possibility underlines the importance of the accurate determination of the properties of cyg x-1 as this object is routinely used as a reference source .",
    "* we propose a new method based on measurements of   of x - ray variability of agn to  estimates",

    "<S> we propose a new method of estimation of the black hole masses in agn based on the normalized excess variance , . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a relation between , the length of the observation , , the light curve bin size , @xmath0 , and the black hole mass , assuming that ( i ) the power spectrum above the high frequency break , , has a slope of @xmath1 , ( ii ) the high frequency break scales with black hole mass , ( iii ) the power spectrum amplitude ( in @xmath2 space ) is universal and ( iv )  is calculated from observations of length @xmath3 . values of black hole masses in agn obtained with this method are consistent with estimates based on other techniques such as reverberation mapping or the -stellar velocity dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> the method is formally equivalent to methods based on power spectrum scaling with mass but the use of  has the big advantage of being applicable to relatively low quality data .    </S>",
