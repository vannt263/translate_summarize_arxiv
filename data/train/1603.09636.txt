    "a driving motivation for the investigation of group actions on musical spaces is their application to the analysis of temporally ordered sequences of musical objects .",
    "chord sequences , and in particular sequences of major and minor triads , constitute a central instance of this work .",
    "the musical objects under consideration are thereby conceived of as elements or `` points '' of an underlying space @xmath8 and the sequences become discrete trajectories @xmath9 within this space .    major and minor triads in a chromatic 12-tone system can be encoded in various ways as the `` points '' of a 24-element set @xmath8 .",
    "we briefly sketch encodings of consonant triads , since the rest of paper relies on this . as is usual in this area , we identify pitch classes with integers modulo 12 via the bijection @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  , and finally @xmath12 .",
    "consonant triads come in two types : major and minor .",
    "a _ major triad _",
    "@xmath13 is said to have _ root _",
    "@xmath14 , _ third _ @xmath15 , and _ fifth _ @xmath16 .",
    "the _ letter name _ of this major triad is the letter corresponding to the root @xmath14 under the aforementioned bijection .",
    "similarly , a _ minor triad _ @xmath17 has _ root _",
    "@xmath14 , _ third _ @xmath18 , and _ fifth _ @xmath16 . the _ letter name _ of this minor triad is the letter corresponding to the root @xmath14 .",
    "major triads are indicated by capital letters , minor triads are indicated by lowercase letters .",
    "a _ voicing _ of a triad corresponds to a selected ordering encoded as a 3-tuple @xmath19 .",
    "to summarize , one can encode a triad in three possible ways : as an unordered subset @xmath20 , or as an ordered 3-tuple @xmath21 via a pre - selected unique voicing , or as a pair ( root name , mode ) .",
    "returning to our motivation begun in the first paragraph , the `` transformational analyst '' judiciously selects group actions @xmath22 and seeks to interpret trajectories @xmath9 within @xmath8 via associated sequences @xmath23 of transformations @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 , as pictured in the network below .",

    "the analyst thereby _ presupposes that the transformations in question are defined on the entire space @xmath8_.    this global domain presupposition is crucial for the interpretation and evaluation of transformational analyses and needs to be understood in its radicality . in @xcite , david lewin ( 19932003 )",
    "distinguished and compared two simply transitive actions on the consonant triads : one including global reflections ( inversions ) , the other including contextual reflections ( inversions ) .. ] we illustrate the difference on consonant triads as unordered subsets of @xmath6 for the moment .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath27-minor triad @xmath28 as a mirror image of the @xmath29-major triad @xmath30 ( across the axis in the middle of 3 and 10 ) has two natural extensions to the set of all consonant triads .",
    "either one can apply the global reflection operation @xmath31 throughout to all the consonant triads , or one may apply the contextual reflection operation _ parallel _",
    "@xmath32 to all the consonant triads . in the definition of @xmath32 , the _ contextual _ local mirror axis",
    "is selected so as to exchange the root and the fifth of the input chord , so that the input triad and the output triad overlap in the root and the fifth",
    ". the transformation @xmath32 has therefore been characterized as a _",
    "contextual inversion_. the precondition to `` know '' the effect of a transformation on the entire space can be satisfied in both cases through homogeneity assumptions about the underlying pitch class space .",
    "this allows , on the one hand , for the definition of pitch class inversions and transpositions . on the other hand , in the case of the contextual transformations",
    ", one could speak of an isotropy principle , i.e. a uniformity assumption about the collection of the conextual mirror axes .",
    "two other such contextual inversions defined via common tone retention called _ leading tone exchange _ @xmath33 and _ relative _ @xmath34 are recalled in section  [ sec : recollection_of_plr ] .",
    "for an example of transformational interpretations that illustrate the difference between global reflections , consider a _ hexatonic cycle _ of cohn @xcite .",

    "there are ( at least ) two possible group - theoretic interpretations of the hexatonic cycle , one involving the alternating application of neo - riemannian @xmath32 and @xmath33 operations , the other involving the componentwise global reflection operations @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",

    "we realize this network via a single transformation in section [ subsec : grail_motive ] . some mathematical background for @xcite",
    "was recently worked out in @xcite .    what is the music - analytical intention behind the transformational approach ?",
    "critics sometimes see a kind of useless bookkeeping in the activity of labelling chord progressions through transformations .",
    "in fact , if the chosen group action is simply transitive , the analytical activity is suspiciously easygoing : there are as many musical objects as there are transformations available , and for any ordered pair @xmath46 of objects there is a unique transformation @xmath47 sending @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the transformational interpretation of the trajectories is thus completely determined as soon as a simply transitive group action is selected .",
    "to persuade the critics and oneself about the benefit of a transformational analysis , the music - theoretically crucial condition that the effect of a transformation must be `` known '' on the entire space must not be carelessly neglected in the mere bookkeeping of labels .",
    "furthermore there should be an _ economy of description _ involved .",
    "the more chord successions exemplify the same transformation , the better .",
    "for instance , let us reconsider the hexatonic cycle in light of `` economy of description '' to motivate julian hook s notion of uniform triadic transformation in @xcite . notice that description   is more economical than description   because only utilizes the _ two _ transformations @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while utilizes the _ three _ transformations @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "alternating orbits under groups with two generators , such as the alternating @xmath50-orbit in , have been coined _ flip - flop cycles _ by john clough in @xcite .",
    "is it possible to make an even more economical description of the hexatonic cycle with only a _",
    "more precisely , is it possible to define a single transformation which on major triads acts as @xmath32 and on minor triads acts as @xmath33 as in ? hook answers affirmatively with the uniform triadic transformation @xmath51 .",
    "the minus sign indicates the transformation reverses mode , the 0 indicates that a major input is not shifted before reversing mode , and the 8 indicates that a minor input is shifted by 8 before reversing mode .",
    "the flip - flop cycle is thereby turned into an orbit of a cyclic transformation group .",
    "the group @xmath4 of _ uniform triadic transformations _ with its 288 elements is much larger than the 24 element @xmath52-group , so there is a tradeoff between the economy of description and the size of the presupposed transformation group .",
    "we will recall uniform triadic transformations in section  [ sec : a_linear_rep_of_the_utts ] and argue that hook s group @xmath4 occupies a quite natural position within the theoretical perspective of the present approach via a linear representation constructed from @xmath0 and the permutation @xmath53 .",
    "david lewin @xcite often positioned his analytical discourse in another 288-element group , namely in the group generated by the union of the atonal @xmath54-group and the contextual @xmath52-group .- group and @xmath52-group commute with one another , are both of order 24 , and have only two elements in common : the identity and @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath54-group and the @xmath52-group together generate a group of order @xmath56 . ]",
    "using these two competing kinds of transformations in tandem , he typically provides instructive arguments in the spirit of an economy of description principle within this chosen context .",
    "so far , for consonant triads encoded as _ ordered _",
    "3-tuples , we have discussed two kinds of reflection ( inversion ) : the global reflection operations @xmath57 , and the contextual reflection operations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the present paper studies a third kind of reflection , called _ voicing reflection_. in a voicing reflection , the local axis of reflection is determined by the tones in two pre - selected voices , for instance consider for the moment the voice reflection @xmath58 determined by the bass and soprano voices .",
    "let us consider the similarities and differences between the global reflection @xmath36 , the contextual reflection @xmath32 , and the voice reflection @xmath59 .",
    "recall that to compute the _ parallel _",
    "contextual reflection @xmath32 on a consonant triad @xmath60 , we look inside the chord to find the two tones @xmath61 and @xmath62 that span a perfect fifth , and then compute is the unique global reflection that exchanges @xmath61 and @xmath62 . ]",

    "<S> motivated by analytical methods in mathematical music theory , we determine the structure of the subgroup @xmath0 of @xmath1 generated by the three voicing reflections . as applications of our structure theorem , we determine the structure of the stabilizer @xmath2 in @xmath3 of root position triads , and show that @xmath2 is a representation of hook s uniform triadic transformations group @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the centralizer of @xmath0 in both @xmath1 and the monoid @xmath5 of affine transformations , and recover a lewinian duality for trichords containing a generator of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we present a variety of musical examples , including the wagner s hexatonic grail motive and the diatonic falling fifths as cyclic orbits , an elaboration of our earlier work with satyendra on schoenberg , string quartet in @xmath7 minor , op .  7 , and an affine musical map of joseph schillinger . finally , we observe , perhaps unexpectedly , that the retrograde inversion enchaining operation rich ( for arbitrary 3-tuples ) belongs to the representation @xmath2 . </S>",
