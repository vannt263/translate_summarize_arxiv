    "the analysis of non - uniformly hyperbolic systems has undergone an explosion of activity in the last decade with a range of new techniques becoming available ; notably young towers  @xcite , hyperbolic times  @xcite and , earlier , pesin theory for maps with singularities  @xcite .",
    "the application of this machinery on ` real life ' examples is often highly technical , with substantial effort being required , for example , to isolate and analyze lower - dimensional expanding factors whose mixing properties drive statistics for the higher - dimensional hyperbolic map . in this paper",
    "we consider a class of two - dimensional _ generalized baker s transformations _ ( gbts ) whose simple geometry allows , via young towers , the extraction of sharp polynomial rates of correlation decay on hlder observables .",
    "the constructions and proofs are explicit and geometrically natural .",
    "the relevant one - dimensional expanding factors are certain piecewise @xmath1 , markov , non - uniformly expanding maps of the unit interval , the most familiar and well - understood examples we know of for analysis of the connection between hyperbolicity and mixing rates .",
    "the extension from baker s to generalized baker s is easy to describe .",
    "specifically , a two - dimensional map  @xmath0 on the unit square @xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] is determined by a _ cut function _",
    "@xmath3 whose graph @xmath4 partitions @xmath5 into lower and upper pieces .",
    "the cut function is assumed to be measurable and to satisfy @xmath6 ; these are the only constraints in the construction .",
    "the two - dimensional dynamics are depicted in figure [ fig : gbt ] and defined by mapping the vertical lines @xmath7 , into themselves , and sending vertical fibres into vertical fibres ( the fibre over @xmath8 goes to part of the fibre over @xmath9 ) in such a way that areas are preserved ; if we define @xmath10 then the rectangle @xmath11\\times [ 0,1]$ ] maps to the lower part of the square under the graph of @xmath3 and @xmath12\\times [ 0,1]$ ] maps to the upper part . the resulting map @xmath0 preserves lebesgue measure @xmath13 on the square @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath0 necessarily has a discontinuity along the vertical line @xmath14 .",
    "clearly @xmath0 is hyperbolic : through each point on the square passes a contracting leaf ( vertical line ) and an expanding leaf ( the graph of a measurable function ) .",
    "@xmath0 is uniformly hyperbolic if and only if the cut function @xmath3 is bounded away from zero and one as depicted in the figure [ fig : gbt ] .    when @xmath15 the map is the classical baker s transformation .",
    "the construction was introduced in @xcite where many basic dynamical properties were established .",
    "for example , regularity conditions on the cut allow one to conclude that @xmath0 is ergodic , or even bernoulli .",
    "perhaps more surprisingly , it was shown that every measure preserving transformation @xmath16 on a ( nonatomic , standard , borel ) probability space with entropy satisfying will always mean the natural logarithm .",
    "the upper bound in this inequality is not essential ; any finite entropy map may be represented by a gbt , provided you allow multiple cut functions on the square . ] @xmath17 is measurably isomorphic to some gbt on the square @xmath5 , so in some sense , these are universal examples of measure preserving systems .",
    "a recent literature search uncovered more than 80 articles describing generalized baker s maps , of which the construction above represents only one possible direction .",
    "some investigations consider only locally affine , measure preserving transformations , a minor variant of the classical example and a subcase of the present construction .",
    "there are also fat baker s tranformations ",
    "noninvertible maps where the expansion in the unstable direction dominates contraction on vertical fibres ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "generically such maps admit an absolutely continuous invariant srb measure . the recent article @xcite studies baker s transformations on non - square domains whose expanding factors are certain @xmath18transformations .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to establish sharp polynomial decay of correlation estimates for some non - uniformly hyperbolic examples of the map @xmath0 above acting on @xmath19-d hlder observables .",
    "obtaining sharp decay rates for multidimensional hyperbolic systems has proved to be rather difficult in general and the majority of results of this type are in the exponential or stretched exponential class ( see , for example @xcite  ( billiards ) , @xcite  ( lorentz scatterers ) , @xcite  ( henon maps ) for the former , and @xcite  ( following@xcite ) for the latter ) . for specific higher dimensional families of _ hyperbolic _ maps the only sharp sub - exponential results known to us are for certain billiards , in particular in a bunimovich stadium the rate is @xmath20 ( see @xcite and @xcite and references contained therein ) .",
    "although the simple geometry of our class could be viewed as artificial , it is extremely effective for illustrating some of the obstacles ( and techniques used to overcome them ) that have been central to the subject in recent years .    in order to carry out our analysis ,",
    "we first establish the corresponding rate - of - mixing result on an appropriate @xmath21-d expanding factor @xmath22 .",
    "this map arises naturally from the action of @xmath0 on the invariant family of ` vertical fibres ' ; @xmath22 will be a piecewise monotone and continuous map of the unit interval having indifferent fixed points at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "non - uniformly expanding @xmath25d interval maps such as our @xmath22 are currently much better understood than the corresponding multidimensional transformations .",
    "analysis of maps of the interval with indifferent fixed points was carried out in @xcite and references cited there .",
    "this early work also anticipates one of the most fruitful modern approaches : the construction of a markov extensions or young towers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we also begin by constructing a suitable young tower for @xmath22 after which , upper bounds on the rate of decay of correlation against hlder data are routine to obtain . in our case",
    "these rates are polynomial ( the exact rate depending on which map @xmath22 from the family is being considered ; all polynomial mixing rates may be attained simply by the choice of parameters leading to @xmath22 ( and @xmath0 ) ) .",
    "recently , @xcite investigates a parameterized family of @xmath21-d circle maps on @xmath26 $ ] proving they have polynomial mixing rates .",
    "it turns out these maps are conjugate to certain @xmath22 given by our construction ( see example [ ex : cristadoro ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our examples need not be symmetric , and the @xmath27d connections we are motivated by in this paper are not investigated in @xcite .",
    "analysis of the mixing properties of @xmath0 proceeds by lifting the corresponding estimates for @xmath22 back to the square along stable fibres . in this case , because of the simple geometry , this step is relatively simple compared to previous studies in the literature , including the ones cited above .",
    "another approach to the study of non - uniformly hyperbolic maps depends on the analysis of _ hyperbolic times_. in @xcite we show that , while all our examples @xmath22 have positive density of hyperbolic times , the first hyperbolic time function may or may not be integrable , depending on the order of tangency of the cut function to the boundary of the square at @xmath28 and @xmath29 . indeed , it is possible to obtain sharp estimates on @xmath30 where @xmath31 is lebesgue measure and @xmath32 denotes the first @xmath33-hyperbolic time for the orbit at @xmath8 ( see @xcite for definitions and related computations ) .",
    "analysis of hyperbolic times for our maps @xmath22 will not be used in this paper .    in the next section we set up the notation used throughout the paper and define our family of baker s maps @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : youngtowers ] we begin with a brief review of the young tower construction in a form that best suits our application . in sections  [",
    "s : towers][ss : lowerbounds ] we build towers for the @xmath21-d maps @xmath22 induced by @xmath0 acting on the stable leaves and establish sharp rates of correlation decay for these systems with respect to @xmath21-d hlder observables .",
    "we complete the work in section  [ s:2ddecay ] by lifting the @xmath21-d results in a natural way to identical decay estimates on the @xmath19-d maps @xmath0 .",
    "some elementary computations ( essentially calculus exercises ) are gathered in appendix 1 .",
    "with respect to notation from the previous section , the relevant equations are easy to derive : @xmath34 where @xmath35    note that the function @xmath22 appears implicitly in equations ( [ eqn : map1 ] ) .",
    "provided the set of @xmath36 where @xmath3 takes on the value @xmath37 or @xmath21 is of measure zero , it is easy to see that @xmath22 ( and hence @xmath38 ) is uniquely defined for every @xmath39 $ ] ( respectively , for @xmath40 )",
    ". this will be the case for all examples in this paper .    even without this restriction , by construction , @xmath41 is defined by equation ( [ eqn : map1 ] ) for lebesgue almost every point @xmath42 in the square @xmath5 , is invertible and preserves two - dimensional lebesgue measure . for details , and a formula for @xmath43 see @xcite .",

    "<S> the mechanisms leading to a slow rate of correlation decay are especially transparent in our examples due to the simple geometry in the construction . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we propose this class of maps as an excellent testing ground for new techniques for the analysis of decay of correlations in non - uniformly hyperbolic systems . finally , some of our examples can be seen to be extensions of certain 1-d non - uniformly expanding maps that have appeared in the literature over the last twenty years thereby providing a unified treatment of these interesting and well - studied examples .    </S>",
