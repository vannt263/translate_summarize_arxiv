    "neutrons constitute a very important background for experiments looking for rare events in deep underground laboratories .",
    "the vast majority is produced by natural radioactivity in the rock or the materials used in the detectors : traces of u / th emit @xmath5 particles which may then interact with light nuclei ( z@xmath630 ) to produce neutrons ; another contribution comes from spontaneous fission of heavy elements ( mainly @xmath7u ) .",
    "the energy range of these neutrons is restricted to a few mev , and it is therefore possible to shield detectors from rock neutrons using h - rich materials , which moderate and capture them .",
    "radioactivity from detector parts can in turn be minimised by an appropriate choice of building materials and selection of batches .",
    "moreover , these local sources of radioactivity can be assessed with dedicated measurements ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the boulby underground laboratory ) .",
    "detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations can then use this information to optimise the geometry of the passive shielding and to predict this contribution to the total background of the experiment , thus reducing its systematic uncertainties .",
    "a much smaller contribution comes from muon interactions in the rock and surrounding materials , which produce fast neutrons with energies up to the gev scale .",
    "these high energy neutrons can easily penetrate through passive shielding ( which can in fact act as a target for their production ) and interact in the detectors . in dark matter searches ,",
    "elastic scattering of high energy neutrons produces nuclear recoils within the expected energy range of interactions from weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . in double beta decay experiments they contribute to the @xmath8-ray background via inelastic scattering and capture ; they also mimic neutrino detection in scintillators via inverse beta decay .",
    "active vetoes are thus necessary to help remove this background , by looking at coincidences with high energy deposits from the primary muon or the associated cascade . in spite of this",
    ", these neutrons can travel far from the original muon track , interacting in the detector while leaving no telltale signature in the anti - coincidence system or the detector itself .",
    "we show in section [ results ] that the rate expected from such events in the energy range of interest is quite low for the current generation of dark matter experiments based on liquid rare gases , which have only a few kilograms of active material . but with projects under way to build detectors with hundreds or thousands of kilograms , the precise knowledge of this neutron flux and the ability to model it correctly becomes paramount for the design of both the detectors and the associated anti - coincidence systems",
    "moreover , current detectors would also benefit from this , as it would allow for a reduction in the systematic errors of the expected background .",
    "measuring the flux of muon - induced neutrons is not trivial , as the requirements are almost those of a low - background experiment : the detector must be sensitive to neutrons and have a large mass , it must be placed in an underground laboratory , and it must be stable throughout the duration of the measurement , which is typically a few months long .",
    "several experiments have tried to measure this flux in the last decades , using either accelerators on the surface @xcite or dedicated experiments in underground laboratories @xcite , and several groups have projects for new measurements ( see , for example , @xcite ) . but these results are often mutually inconsistent ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of available data ) . moreover , at the time when these experiments were performed detailed mc simulations were not possible due to the lack of computational power and adequate theoretical models .",
    "powerful simulation packages based on advanced theoretical models , such as geant4 @xcite and fluka @xcite , are now available , and although they had some success in explaining the neutron yield in low - a materials , both fail to explain older measurements of neutron production in lead , as was investigated in @xcite . extracting the neutron yield from available data is not straightforward , as it requires a detailed description of all physical processes involved and of the geometrical setup used in the experiment .",
    "moreover , such simulations are not trivial either : a good knowledge of the muon flux and energy spectrum for the particular underground site is essential , as they determine the neutron energy spectrum and yield ; the statistical efficiency is very low , i.e.  a very large number of muons has to be simulated in order to produce a statistically significant result ; and it is all too easy to bias the final result while trying to improve this efficiency .",
    "recent works have used these simulation packages to try to explain published data @xcite or to predict the muon - induced neutron background in underground experiments and optimise the shielding and veto systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "new measurements of total neutron yield in different materials , the energy spectrum and lateral distribution regarding the primary muon track are therefore urgent , but should be supported by detailed mc simulations , preferably using multi - purpose packages ( such as geant4 and fluka ) so that their results can be applied to the design of other experiments .",
    "a new measurement of muon - induced neutrons has recently been performed in the boulby underground laboratory ( boulby mine , north yorkshire , uk ) @xcite .",
    "a large mass of lead was used as a target that completely surrounded the experimental apparatus .",
    "the prime goal of this paper is to describe the detailed monte carlo simulations carried out to predict the rate of events due to muon - induced neutrons in a scintillator used in the aforementioned experiment ( section [ simulation ] ) .",
    "accurate monte carlo of all physical processes and of the whole setup including trigger conditions and selection cuts , and the comparison of the simulation results with the measurements allowed us , for the first time , to test theoretical models directly and to make a robust prediction of the neutron yield in lead ( section [ results ] ) .",
    "the result for lead is particularly important since i ) lead is used as a shielding against gamma - rays in high - sensitivity experiments for rare event searches , such as direct dark matter , double - beta decay and neutrino experiments ; ii ) previous measurements of muon - induced neutron flux in lead reported a higher yield compared to simulations ( carried out , however , by different teams not connected to the original experiments ) .",
    "we have also performed detailed comparison of our monte carlo with previous simulations using geant4 and fluka , and investigated the dependence of the neutron yield on the models used in simulations ( section [ models ] ) .",
    "we show ( section [ models ] ) that our simulations agree within a factor of 2 with most available data on neutron yields in light targets but can not explain some of the previously reported measurements , in particular in heavy targets such as lead .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that our models were too simplified and did not take into account all details of the experimental setup ( detector configuration , trigger , cuts , etc . )",
    "that were not publicly available .",
    "the procedure for muon - induced neutron modelling described in this paper can also be used in similar simulations for any other underground experiment for rare event searches .",
    "processes responsible for neutron production by muons can be categorised in four main classes : _",
    "i ) _ muon capture and _ ii ) _ direct muon spallation result from direct interactions of muons with nuclei . in thick targets",
    "showers initiated by a muon - induced spallation are the dominant source of neutrons : _ iii ) _ photo- and lepto- production , mainly in electromagnetic cascades , _ iv ) _ hadro - production , mainly in hadronic cascades .",
    "negative muon capture is only dominant for shallow depths ( @xmath6100 m w.e . ) , where abundant stopping muons can be captured resulting in highly excited isotopes which then emit one or more neutrons . in direct muon spallation",
    "the muon - nucleus interaction may be described through the exchange of a virtual photon , resulting in nuclear disintegration .",
    "this treatment allows the use of measured @xmath8-n cross sections ( real photons ) to model this process , but breaks down at low energies , when the virtuality of the photon becomes comparable to the muon energy @xcite .",
    "many particles and mechanisms are involved in neutron production within showers , and so it is not surprising that many physics models are required to describe them over different energy ranges .",
    "in addition , geant4 may offer alternative models to treat each physical process , which can be selected according to the particular requirements of each simulation ( e.g. the trade - off between computational efficiency and accuracy is often considered ) .",
    "some of the models available for describing interactions of muons and their associated showers were tested previously @xcite using version 6.2 of the toolkit against other simulation results ; in this work we use a similar set of models with version 8.2 :    * muon - induced spallation : available above 1 gev muon energy ; the resulting final states are obtained from parameterised hadronic models .",
    "* photo - production ( @xmath8 inelastic scattering ) : final states are generated by a chiral - invariant phase - space ( chips ) decay model below 3 gev photon energy , while a theoretical quark - gluon string ( qgs ) model is used at higher energies . * hadronic interactions of nucleons , pions and kaons : a qgs model is used for high energies and an intra - nuclear binary cascade ( bic ) for low energies . an older parameterised model ( lep ) can be used to cover the intermediate range .",
    "this is discussed in more detail further ahead .",
    "* de - excitation of the residual nucleus : @xmath8 and fragment evaporation , fission , fermi break - up and multi - fragmentation ( for highly excited nuclei ) . *",
    "neutron interactions are treated using data - driven models below 19 mev .    for electromagnetic interactions",
    "the so - called ` low energy ' package was used with production thresholds of a few tens of kev for @xmath8-rays and @xmath41 mev for e@xmath9 and e@xmath10 in all materials .",
    "such low thresholds are justified by the importance of the photo - nuclear process as a significant source of neutrons .",
    "the importance of the energy scale at which the changeover between the bic and the qgs hadronic models occurs was studied .",
    "the former aims to describe interactions in the low energy range ( ref .",
    "@xcite recomends its usage below 3  gev for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and 1.5 gev for pions , pointing out that it should work reasonably well up to 10  gev for @xmath13 ) . at very low energies ( below @xmath470  mev , but the real threshold depends on atomic mass , @xmath14 ) it reverts to a ` precompound ' model , which handles the nuclear de - excitation in the pre - equilibrium stage . on the other hand , qgs is targeted at high energies ( above 20  gev ) and depends on other models to fragment and de - excite the damaged nucleus after the initial interaction .",
    "this may involve either the precompound model ( this association is usually known as qgsp ) or the chips model ( qgsc ) .",
    "there is currently no theoretical model available to cover the energy region between the bic and qgs models ; the solution commonly adopted is a low - energy parameterisation model ( lep ) , but this is not kinematically correct for a single interaction @xcite .",
    "we analysed different possibilities to bridge this energy range .",
    "firstly the lep model was avoided altogether for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , using changeover energies of 6  gev ( first test ) and of 10  gev ( second test ) between the bic and qgsp models .",
    "a third test relied on lep for @xmath11 and @xmath12 between 10 and 20  gev ( this is very similar to the approach used in the qgsp_bic_hp reference physics list provided by geant4 @xcite ) .",
    "as for pions we never extended the recommended range of the bic model ( 1.5 gev ) , and thus had to use lep to bridge to the qgsp minimum energy ( note that this is unlike the qgsp_bic_hp reference physics list , where the lep model is used down to low energies ) .",
    "for all other hadrons , low- and high - energy parameterised models were used .",
    "these approaches were tested in various materials for different muon energies .",
    "we found that the resulting neutron yields always agreed within 10% , which is a smaller discrepancy than that observed between versions 6.2 and 8.2 of the toolkit .",
    "geant4 offers an alternative model to bic for the treatment of low energy hadronic reactions , the bertini cascade @xcite : this is similarly found not to alter the total yields noticeably @xcite .",
    "we thus opted for a direct changeover at 6  gev between bic and qgsp for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as it enables a more direct comparison with earlier work @xcite .",
    "we began by benchmarking the neutron yield simulations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for different materials using a similar setup .",
    "this consisted of a beam of mono - energetic @xmath15 incident at the centre of a slab of material with thickness 3200 g/@xmath3 ; only neutrons produced in the central half - length of the slab were counted to avoid edge effects .",
    "treatment of secondary neutrons produced in inelastic scattering was also considered to prevent double counting .",

    "lines connecting the markers are to guide the eye only . ]",
    "as most of the neutron yield data available is for organic scintillators , we started by studying a c@xmath17h@xmath18 hydrocarbon with density @xmath19 g/@xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , these results are extensible to generic hydrocarbons c@xmath21h@xmath16 , which can also represent materials usually used as passive neutron shielding .",

    "are the yields obtained with geant4 version 6.2 ( as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and fluka-2008 . the neutron yields obtained with fluka-2008 are in good agreement to what was reported in refs .",
    "@xcite using fluka-1999 , but lower ( especially at low energies ) than the fluka-2003 results reported in ref .",
    "it is clear that version 8.2 of geant4 , while still consistent with the experimental measurements , produces systematically fewer neutrons than version 6.2 . at lower energies ( @xmath22  gev ) the yield is closer to that predicted by fluka , while the agreement with version 6.2 of geant4 is better at higher energies .",

    "figure [ fig - c10h20_280_proc ] shows the differential energy spectrum of neutrons produced by 280  gev muons in this material as well as the contributions from the most important individual processes .",
    "the photonuclear interaction of @xmath8-rays dominates for low energy neutrons ( @xmath640  mev ) , while pion spallation is the biggest contributor above this energy .",
    "the pion absorption process shows the expected cut - off right below the pion rest mass subtracted by the nucleon binding energy , but unlike what has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the classical geant4 nuclear capture model was used , does not exhibit a distinct peak before this cut - off . in this work we used a new chips - based model , which produces a smoother spectrum with more low energy neutrons .",
    "muon spallation , responsible for initiating the electromagnetic and hadronic showers , clearly contributes very little to direct neutron production for muon energies above 100  gev .",
    "version 6.2 of geant4 yields very similar results for all processes , with the notable exception of the photonuclear interaction for which it produces more low energy neutrons ( @xmath620  mev )",
    ".        we also tested other materials of relevance for low background experiments , namely nacl ( which dominates the composition of boulby rock ) and pb ( usually used as passive @xmath8-ray shielding ) .",
    "for this study we used 280 gev muons , close to the mean muon energy at boulby ( @xmath4260  gev ) , and kept the selection rules mentioned previously .",

    "for the latter only c@xmath29h@xmath16 , nacl and pb were tested , while for the former results for several materials are presented along with the respective fits to the power law @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the neutron rate and @xmath14 is the atomic weight ) .",
    "geant4 8.2 yields are consistent with those obtained with version 6.2 , while fluka-1999 predicts consistently higher rates : @xmath430% higher in c@xmath21h@xmath16 , @xmath450% in nacl and @xmath480% in pb .",

    "it is clear that the increase in neutron yield seen in materials with large atomic number comes mainly from low energy neutrons ( @xmath620  mev ) .",
    "these spectra can be compared with the spectra from rock radioactivity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of boulby ) : while neutrons from the rock are restricted to a few mev , muon induced neutrons extend to tens and even hundreds of mev .    in conclusion , the neutron yields from geant4 have not changed significantly from version 6.2 to 8.2 for the materials and energies of interest for our experimental setup .",
    "differences to the fluka results are still present and in some cases even accentuated , with the latter producing nearly twice as many neutrons in lead . as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite this difference in the neutron yield may originate from an over - production in hadronic cascades by fluka : as the emission of fast nuclear fragments from highly excited nuclei is not modelled , more energy is available for neutron evaporation .",
    "as mentioned previously , the muon - nucleus interaction can be modelled by the exchange of a virtual photon , which allows the use of cross - sections parameterised for the case of the real photonuclear interaction . for thick targets",
    "this is not a dominant process for neutron production , and its importance decreases with both energy and atomic weight @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we discuss it here in more detail in order to test a new implementation based on the chips concept , which has become available in recent versions of geant4 .",
    "chips ( see @xcite and references therein ) was first available in this toolkit as a nuclear de - excitation model , meant to be used in conjunction with other models ( such as the qgs ) which handled the initial interaction . recently , new chips - based implementations have become available which include the cross - sections of the primary interaction and simulate the entire reaction for a number of projectiles including muons .        as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite the older geant4 model for the simulation of muon - induced spallation ( munuclear ) failed to describe the results obtained by the cern na55 experiment @xcite , which claimed to have measured fast neutron production in graphite , copper and lead using a beam of 190 gev muons .",

    "the new chips model for muon spallation produces a dramatic increase for graphite , showing a reasonable agreement with the data ; using the complete set of physics processes does not change this result . as for copper ,",
    "the primary process by itself already produces more neutrons than the older one , but in this case it is only the use of the complete physics list that brings the simulation result closer to the measured yields , showing that this could not be considered as a thin target .",
    "the very large discrepancy observed for lead remains unexplained , with the chips - based models yielding approximately the same result as the older versions , about one order of magnitude lower than the measurement . considering a lower energy threshold for the neutron detectors helps to reduce this difference , but a value as low as 3 mev is required for a reasonable agreement . in any case",
    "the shape of the distribution still disagrees with the measurements .",
    "figure [ fig - na55-energy ] compares the neutron energy spectra using physics lists with complete sets of processes ( cases @xmath34 and @xmath36 ) for each of these materials .",
    "results from both simulations are more similar in the case of lead , but as already indicated from figure [ fig - na55-yield ] completely fail in reproducing the experimental results for all three angles .",
    "chips produces a better agreement for graphite , but is still lower for 45@xmath32 at high energies .",
    "the differences between simulation and data are not as evident in copper as in lead , but both models still clearly fail in describing their behaviour .    from the analysis of figures [ fig - na55-yield ] and [ fig - na55-energy ] it is clear that none of the tested models is able to describe the whole set of results from the na55 experiment . however",
    ", this disagreement should be taken with caution : it is difficult to do such simulations retrospectively based on the little information available in the literature .",
    "this reafirms the need for new experiments accompanied by dedicated and detailed mc simulations of the experimental setup and selection criteria .",

    "the detector was calibrated in energy with a @xmath37co source ( at the beginning and end of the run ) ; its sensitivity to neutron captures was tested with a 0.1 gbq ( @xmath5  activity ) am - be source at the beginning of the run .",
    "both tests were simulated with geant4 using the same geometry and set of physics models described above , with the only difference being the primary particles passed to the simulation : for the energy calibration @xmath8-rays were emitted with energies from either of the two @xmath37co lines ( 1.173  mev and 1.333  mev ) ; for the am - be run the sources4a @xcite code was used to generate the energy spectrum of the initial neutrons .",
    "comparison of these simulations with experimental data shows a very good agreement ( particularly in terms of time delay distribution of @xmath8-rays from neutron captures ) @xcite , thus validating the geometry implementation and physics models used .",
    "note , however , that the neutron calibration is not ideal for evaluating the detector response to muon - induced neutrons : am - be neutrons have , on average , lower energies and are created at a fixed location ( just below the castle roof ) , whereas neutrons originated by muons have higher energies and can be created anywhere .",
    "there are also other differences , due to experimental limitations : the triggers used are necessarily different ( neutron - induced proton recoils instead of high - energy deposits from muons ) and the fact that the acquisition system was running with almost 100% dead - time during calibration .",
    "all these problems are obviously not particular to this experiment , but rather apply to any similar experiment that uses neutron sources for their calibration .",
    "nevertheless , this calibration allows us to show that this experiment is sensitive to neutrons and that our simulation is accurate enough to simulate neutron transport and detection in the mev and sub - mev energy ranges .",
    "some results from this simulation were already analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was used as an aid in the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "comparison of the simulated muon rate with the experimental value of 52.9  @xmath0  0.5 per day allows the estimation of the muon flux at boulby as ( 3.79 @xmath0 0.04  ( stat ) @xmath0 0.11  ( syst ) )  @xmath1  10@xmath38 @xmath39s@xmath40 , with the systematic error coming from an uncertainty in the energy scale , discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the vertical depth obtained from this measurement is 2850  @xmath0  20  m w.e .",

    "detailed descriptions of the procedures to estimate the muon flux and depth can be found in ref .",

    "was not simulated , the energy deposition was smeared using a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation , @xmath41 , given by the equation @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath43 were determined by comparing the smeared spectrum with the measurements , and the result was used for the energy calibration of the experimental data and the definition of the threshold for muons ( 20  mev ) and delayed @xmath8-rays ( 0.55  mev ) .",
    "the shape of the time delay distributions ( of @xmath8-rays from neutron captures ) for ` roof - on ' and ` roof - off ' simulations was compared with experimental data ( using the combined data from both experimental runs ) , showing a good agreement in the interval 40    190  @xmath44s .",
    "the first 20  @xmath44s were not considered due to the high level of after - pulsing in the experimental data following the muon signal , while the period from 20 to 40  @xmath44s was removed because of the high probability of detecting @xmath8-rays from neutron captures in gadolinium , which is difficult to simulate accurately due to uncertainties in its distribution in the wax , resin and paint materials used .",
    "the agreement in the shape of the simulated and measured time delay distributions from 40 ",
    "190 @xmath44s also enables a direct comparison of the neutron rates ( defined as the average number of detected neutrons per detected muon ) , by counting the @xmath8-rays from captured neutrons inside this interval in both distributions .",
    "the average rate obtained from the experimental data is 0.079  @xmath0  0.003 neutrons / muon ( 0.084  @xmath0  0.004 neutrons / muon for ` roof - on ' , 0.072  @xmath0  0.005 neutrons / muon for ` roof - off ' ) .",
    "the average rate from the simulation is 0.143  @xmath0  0.002  @xmath0  0.009 neutrons / muon ( 0.143  @xmath0  0.002 neutrons / muon for ` roof - on',0.143  @xmath0  0.003 neutrons / muon for ` roof - off ' ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty comes mainly from the already mentioned uncertainty in the energy scale .",
    "there is a factor of 1.8 difference between simulated and experimental values , with geant4 predicting a higher neutron rate than measured .",
    "given the agreement in the shape of the time delay distribution in both the am - be neutron calibration and the background runs , it is unlikely that this difference results from a problem in the geometry setup of the simulation or the capture and low energy transport models of neutrons ( these models were also tested in ref . @xcite and found to be in good agreement with mcnpx @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the most probable explanation for the excess of muon - induced neutrons lies in the geant4 models involved in neutron production .",
    "figure [ fig - mu - multiplicity ] shows the relative contribution of each neutron multiplicity to the overall number of detected @xmath8-rays for both experimental and simulated data .",
    "it is clear that geant4 produces an excess of neutrons for all multiplicities up to @xmath45 .",
    "constraints in the data acquisition system effectively limit the number of recorded pulses to 16 , but analysis of simulated events with larger multiplicities show that the fraction of missed neutrons is at the level of a few percent , and thus does not contribute significantly to the observed difference in the rates .",

    "table [ tab - mu - nproduction ] shows the contributions of the most relevant materials for neutron production . in the `",
    "detected ' columns only neutrons with @xmath8-ray hits above threshold and in the time interval 40  ",
    "190  @xmath44s were used , while ` all ' includes all neutrons that ended up being captured in the simulation ( although very small , there is a finite probability that a neutron leaves the geometrical limits of the simulation without being captured ) .",
    "as expected , nearly all neutrons created in this experiment come from rock , but only fewer than 10% are detected , attesting the effectiveness of the shield .",
    "lead is by far the biggest producer of detected neutrons , being responsible for @xmath490% . even in",
    "` roof - off ' runs , when there is a 12% reduction in pb mass , its contribution to the number of detected neutrons decreases by less than 1% .",
    "this can be due to two reasons .",
    "first , the presence of a large volume of gd - loaded wax in the roof section enhances the moderation and capture of neutrons in this region , further away from the veto than the h - rich materials .",
    "moreover , the chosen time window deliberately excludes the period in which the captures in gd dominate .",
    "scintillator itself does not give a noticeable contribution to neutron production .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - zeplin2-nr ]    the predicted number of events involving at least one nuclear recoil ( and with any energy deposition ) in the target volume of zeplin - ii is 57.7  @xmath0  6.9 per year , of which 13  @xmath0  3.3 have no coincident electromagnetic deposition .",
    "3.3  @xmath0  1.6 of these events are expected to fall in the interesting energy range for wimp search , but this number can be further reduced to 0.8  @xmath0  0.8 if we consider that the detector has enough spatial resolution to resolve the locations of multiple neutron elastic interactions and remove these events",
    ". nevertheless , when we introduce an anti - coincidence cut with the veto signal ( even using a threshold as high as 1  mev ) no nr event survives . if only the inner volume of zeplin - ii is used in the data analysis ( 7.2  kg )",
    "these neutron rates are reduced by approximately a factor of 4 .",
    "data from the zeplin - ii science run @xcite , with a total exposure of 225  kg@xmath1days , was re - analysed to search for neutron recoils in coincidence with a large muon signal in the veto , but none was found .",
    "these results show that the muon - induced background is not a severe threat for the current generation of detectors , with target masses up to a few tens of kilograms , but may become a problem for larger scale targets .",
    "version 8.2 of the geant4 toolkit was used to create a detailed monte carlo simulation of the first experiment to measure the muon - induced neutron background at the boulby underground laboratory , which used the 0.73 tonne liquid scintillator veto from the zeplin - i and zeplin - ii dark matter search experiments .",
    "first , the neutron yields of mono - energetic muons in different materials of interest to this experiment were compared with results obtained with older versions of this toolkit and other simulation packages , to benchmark recent modifications to the relevant models .",
    "yields are consistently lower than the fluka predictions for all three materials tested and 280  gev muons , the differences being 30% for c@xmath29h@xmath16 , 50% for nacl and 80% for pb , but are still in good agreement with version 6.2 of geant4 .",
    "newly available chips - based models were also tested while attempting to describe results from the na55 experiment , which tried to measure the neutron production in thin targets of different materials .",
    "these new models clearly produce higher yields for all materials and detection angles , but are still far from explaining the controversial na55 results .    a direct comparison of the simulated and measured neutron capture rates in the 40190  @xmath44s window after the trigger reveals that the simulation predicts 1.8 times more neutrons than measured ( well beyond statistical and systematical errors ) , with a similar contribution from mutiplicities up to 12 .",
    "given that pb is responsible for @xmath490% of the detected neutrons , this implies that the geant4 models over - predict the neutron production in this material , contrary to what was expected from the comparison with fluka predictions and the na55 results .",
    "the neutron yield in lead was estimated to be ( 1.31  @xmath0  0.06 )  @xmath1  10@xmath2 neutrons / muon/(g/@xmath3 ) .",
    "finally , the contribution of muon - induced neutrons to the zeplin - ii background was estimated .",
    "the expected single nuclear recoil rate is less than one event per year , but an anti - coincidence with the veto effectively removes all nuclear recoil events , confirming that this is not a meaningful source of background for a detector of this size .",
