    "the problem that we would like to investigate in this paper is concerned with the long - time stability of the solar system . however taking into account all planets ( possibly including also the satellites )",
    "is obviously an overwhelming task .",
    "therefore we limit our efforts to considering a simplified model including three giant planets , namely studying the sun - jupiter - saturn - uranus ( sjsu ) system .",
    "moreover we make a further simplification by considering the planar model . in the spirit of a long - time research that we are conducting",
    ", we investigate the stability in nekhoroshev sense in the neighbourhood of an approximated kam torus close to the real orbits of the planets .    to this end , we first make a short summary of the relevant information concerning kam and nekhoroshev theories .",
    "then we give an account of our results .      in",
    "his celebrated article appeared in 1954 ( see  @xcite ) , kolmogorov proved the persistence of quasi - periodic motions on invariant tori for nearly - integrable hamiltonian systems . in the same paper he pointed out the possible applications of his theorem to the problem of the stability of the solar system .",
    "more generally , celestial mechanics appeared as a main field of applications of kolmogorov theory .",
    "nowadays , there is no doubt that the suggestion of kolmogorov was prophetic .",
    "perhaps the first application is concerned with the stability of the equilateral lagrangian points in the planar circular restricted three - body problem ( hereafter pcr3bp , see  @xcite ) .",
    "a little later the papers of moser and arnold ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) gave the first detailed proof of kolmogorov s theorem , that was only sketched in the original 1954 paper .",
    "the three above mentioned works marked the beginning of the so - called kam theory .",
    "the relevance of kam theory for celestial mechanics was emphasized also by moser ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular he recalled the old idea , strongly supported by weierstrass , that the trigonometric perturbation series of celestial mechanics should be actually convergent , thus proving that the motion of the planets is quasi - periodic .",
    "that is , essentially described by the old - fashioned epicycles of the greek astronomy .",
    "kam theory has been used to prove the stability of some particular systems : the spin - orbit problem , the motion of the asteroid victoria in the framework of the pcr3bp , the secular dynamics of the sun - jupiter - saturn system , etc .",
    "( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "all these models have two degrees of freedom , therefore their stability is proved by a topological argument .",
    "the key point is that an invariant torus is a two - dimensional manifold that separates the three - dimensional energy surface .",
    "therefore , orbits starting in the region between two invariant kam tori on the same energy surface , remain perpetually confined there . for more degrees of freedom , @xmath0 ,",
    "one is confronted with the problem that the set of invariant kam tori has positive lebesgue measure , but empty interior .",
    "therefore , the energy manifold is ( @xmath1)-dimensional , while the invariant tori are @xmath2-dimensional , so that they can not act as barriers for the motion .",
    "this opens the problem of the so - called arnold diffusion , the generic existence of which has been recently proven near a resonance of codimension one ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a different approach to the problem of stability may be based on the theorem of nekhoroshev ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) . the difference may be summarized as follows . in kam theory one proves perpetual stability only for a large ( cantor - like ) set of initial conditions , thus renouncing to consider all possible configurations . in nekhoroshev",
    "theory one looks for a result valid for all initial data ( e.g. , in an open set ) , but accepts stability for a finite time , asking that time to be very long .",
    "actually , this kind of approach was already proposed by moser and littlewood ( see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) in a local approach around an equilibrium point .",
    "their theory essentially constitutes the so - called analytic part of the proof of nekhoroshev s theorem .",
    "the remarkable contribution of nekhoroshev is represented by the geometric part , which allows him to describe the dynamics in the whole phase space .",
    "let us rephrase the statement of nekhoroshev s theorem in an informal way .",
    "the theorem is concerned with the general problem of dynamics , so - named by poincar .",
    "one considers an analytic hamiltonian @xmath3 ( in action - angle variables @xmath4 , with open @xmath5 ) .    _",

    "the underlying idea is that the perpetual stability in lyapunov sense is a too strong property , which can hardly be proved .",
    "in physical applications , including a planetary system , it is enough to prove stability for a time interval comparable with the lifetime of the system itself .",
    "e.g. , for the solar system the estimated age of the universe is enough .",
    "this means that we should investigate stability up to a time of about @xmath13 years .    giving the adjective `` long",
    "'' a definite mathematical sense is of course a more difficult task .",
    "we can only rely on the dependence of @xmath14 on the perturbation parameter @xmath6 .",
    "with reference to history we can collect a short list of attempts .",
    "a.   adiabatic theory means @xmath15 .",
    "this is a concept that has been widely investigated in physics and played a relevant role in the development of quantum theory .",
    "b.   birkhoff complete stability means @xmath16 for some @xmath17 .",
    "the concept has been proposed by birkhoff in  @xcite . c.   exponential stability means @xmath18 as in the statement above .",
    "d.   super - exponential stability means @xmath19 .",
    "this has been proposed by morbidelli and one of the authors in  @xcite .",
    "a further improvement by the same authors shows that in appropriate boxed subsets of the phase space one finds @xmath20 with an increasing number of exponentials .",
    "the limit of the boxed subsets appears to be connected with the set of invariant kam tori , see  @xcite .",
    "the possible applications to the real world deserve a careful detailed discussion . unlike the mathematical approach",
    ", we must face the fact that the size of the perturbation parameter is fixed by nature .",
    "therefore the question may be formulated as follows : given that @xmath14 has some definite behaviour as @xmath6 goes to @xmath21 , what can we say for a specific system with a given value of @xmath6 ?",
    "we refer to this concept as _ effective stability _",
    ", in the sense that we aim to prove that @xmath14 , for that given value of @xmath6 , is large enough to cover some characteristic time of the physical system , e.g. , its lifetime , as we have already said .",
    "the relevant fact in this connection is that the analytic form of @xmath14 provided by analytical theories appears to be just a smoothing of a more complex behavior of the estimated stability time , as it can be found with the help of computer algebra or similar methods .",
    "let us explain this fact in the framework , e.g. , of the stability of an elliptic equilibrium .",
    "the procedure goes through the calculation of the birkhoff normal form up to a finite order @xmath22 .",
    "birkhoff s theory of complete stability states that in a neighbourhood of radius @xmath23 of the equilibrium we get @xmath24 , with a constant @xmath25 that birkhoff did not evaluate . here",
    "the natural perturbation parameter is the distance @xmath26 from the equilibrium , which takes the place of @xmath6 in the general statements above .",
    "the crucial problem is the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath22 .",
    "what we can actually find is a function @xmath27 depending on both parameters @xmath26 and @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "having fixed @xmath26 , we are allowed to make the best choice of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath26 so as to maximize @xmath28 . in the case of the elliptic equilibrium one usually finds @xmath29 with @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , and the optimal choice @xmath32 produces the exponential estimate @xmath33 with @xmath34 . more precisely one finds that there is an increasing sequence @xmath35 of values of @xmath26 such that in every interval @xmath36 one gets @xmath37 . in this respect the theory of moser , littlewood and nekhoroshev appears to bound the latter function @xmath38 from below .    in a practical application ,",
    "if we are able to explicitly calculate the birkhoff normal form up to some maximal order @xmath22 , e.g. , using computer algebra , then we can actually draw the function @xmath38 as the sequence of optimal values of @xmath39 in different intervals , as we do later in figure  [ fig : stab_time ] .",
    "let us give a short historical account on the applications of the methods above in celestial mechanics .",
    "most of them are concerned with the dynamics of trojan asteroids . in  @xcite",
    ", a few asteroids have been shown to be effectively stable ( over the age of the universe ) in the framework of the pcr3bp , where sun and jupiter played the role of the primary bodies on circular orbits .",
    "such an approach is not limited to models having two degrees of freedom ; in fact , it has been extended to the spatial case ( see  @xcite ) and to the elliptic one ( see  @xcite , where the dynamics is represented by a four - dimensional symplectic map instead of using a continuous hamiltonian flow ) .",
    "let us recall that all these results are based on the explicit construction of the birkhoff normal form using computer algebra .",
    "by the way the case of the lagrangian points is precisely the one studied by littlewood where an estimate similar to the exponential one by nekhoroshev has been found .",
    "he commented : _",
    "`` while not eternity , this is a considerable slice of it''_.    a similar approach allows us also to extend the theory of lagrange and laplace for the secular motion of the longitudes of the perihelia and nodes of the planets . indeed , following the traditional approach , we may introduce the secular approximation by assuming that three semi - major axes remain invariant up to order two in the masses .",
    "then the hamiltonian for the eccentricities and inclinations , with the conjugate longitudes of the perihelia and nodes , may be written in poincar variables as a system around an elliptic equilibrium ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the equilibrium in this case corresponds to planar circular orbits .",
    "therefore we may investigate the effective stability of the planets by just extending the method used for the lagrangian equilibria .",
    "it should be noted that the complexity of the problem becomes much larger in view of the increasing number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we stress however that the difficulty is a mere technical one , due to the limitations of memory and computer power .",
    "this method has been applied by the authors to a planar model of the sjsu system ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however the results appear neither realistic nor very promising due to the actual values of the eccentricities of the planets .",
    "indeed , in that paper we have shown that the eccentricities of the planets are too large ( about twice ) , in order to ensure the effective stability of the secular dynamics over the age of the universe .",
    "we remark that this is precisely the model that we investigate in the present paper , with an additional improvement that we are going to describe .    a productive combination of kam and nekhoroshev theories consists in applying the usual , local theory for an elliptic equilibrium to the neighbourhood of an invariant kolmogorov torus . in such a neighbourhood ,",
    "kolmogorov procedure produces a hamiltonian that may be given the form @xmath40 , expanded in power series of the actions @xmath41 ( @xmath42 being of degree @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is indeed similar to the form of the hamiltonian in a neighbourhood of an elliptic equilibrium in action - angle variables .",
    "the apparently strong difference is that in the case of elliptic equilibrium we are dealing with trigonometric polynomials @xmath42 of increasing orders , while in the case of the torus @xmath42 is an infinite trigonometric series .",
    "however this represents a minor problem , indeed we can suitably arrange the hamiltonian as an expansion in trigonometric polynomials , exploiting the exponential decay of fourier coefficients .",
    "therefore the analytic theory for the elliptic equilibrium applies almost verbatim to the neighbourhood of a torus .",
    "this remark suggests that the long - time stability of an elliptic equilibrium and of a torus can be investigated using the same method .",
    "we have applied the latter idea to the sun - jupiter - saturn system ( see  @xcite ) , where we used a previous result on the existence of a torus of the sjs system ( see  @xcite ) based on the explicit expansion of the hamiltonian and on the explicit application of kolmogorov method up to a finite , not too low order .",
    "then we worked out a birkhoff normalization and showed that there is a domain of effective stability , which is centered around an invariant kam torus .",
    "the results were close to realistic ones .    in view of the previous experience",
    ", we decided to work out the application to the planar sjsu system , exploiting the same idea of making expansions around an approximated kam torus .",
    "this is indeed the goal of the present paper .",
    "as it is well known , the major problems in perturbation theory arise from the existence of resonances in the trigonometric expansions .",
    "it goes without saying that a reliable theory should positively take into account these resonant terms . in the case of the sjsu system",
    "the main resonances have been described by murray and holman . with the numerical exploration made in  @xcite ,",
    "they have pointed out the dynamical mechanism inducing a slightly chaotic component in the motion of the major bodies of our planetary system . actually , this phenomenon is due to the overlap of some resonances involving three or four bodies .",
    "an example is given by the resonances @xmath44\\ , , \\qquad { \\rm with}\\ j=0,\\,1,\\,2,\\,3\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 stands for the mean motion frequency of the @xmath46-th planet , @xmath47 means the ( secular ) frequency of its perihelion argument and the labels @xmath48 refer to jupiter , saturn and uranus , respectively .",
    "in fact , during the planetary motion each angle corresponding to the resonances above jumps from libration to rotation and vice versa .",
    "many other resonances analogous to the previous ones are located in the vicinity of the real orbit of the system including the jovian planets , some of them involving also neptune and the frequencies related to the longitudes of the nodes . in the same article a rather simplistic argument is provided so as to evaluate the time needed by these resonances to eject uranus from the solar system , that is estimated to be about @xmath49 years .",
    "one should also recall that the dynamics of the terrestrial planets is much more chaotic : collisions between mercury , mars or , even , venus with the earth could take place in about @xmath50 years ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "our procedure is essentially based on two steps .",
    "first , we explicitly perform the construction of the kolmogorov normal form for the planar secular model of the sjsu system . in this first step ,",
    "the expansions of the hamiltonians introduced by the normalization algorithm are computed by using a software specially designed for doing algebraic manipulations ( see  @xcite ) . in the second step , we avoid the explicit expansions ( due to memory and power limits of our computers ) by setting up a suitable scheme of estimates for the norms of the functions .",
    "precisely , we replace the explicit construction of the birkhoff normal form around the invariant kam torus with a recursive scheme of estimates on the norms .",
    "the results so produced are a little worse with respect to an explicit computation of the series , but nevertheless the final results are acceptably close to be realistic . on the other hand associating to every function a norm ( i.e. , a number ) instead of a trigonometric polynomial obviously makes the calculation definitely faster , while allowing to reach much higher orders .",
    "the whole procedure , including the optimization of the estimates with an optimal choice of the expansion order @xmath22 , allows us to evaluate a lower bound for the stability time @xmath51 .",
    "the final result is the following .",
    "we find a ball of effective stability over the age of the universe having radius @xmath52 and center on the previously found kam torus .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is meaningful from a physical point of view . indeed , considering a ball of initial conditions that takes into account the uncertainties of the astronomical observations , we find a value of @xmath52 which is about ten times smaller .",
    "our result is not supported by a rigorous computer - assisted proof ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but we think that this could be done with some additional effort , similarly to what we did in the past ( see  @xcite ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in order to make the work rather self - consistent ,",
    "the model is introduced in section  [ sec : model ] , where we put a particular care in pointing out some technical difficulties .",
    "section  [ sec : kolmog ] is devoted to the construction of the kolmogorov normal form , so as to find an invariant kam torus which approximates very well the secular orbits of our planetary model . in section",
    "[ sec : nekh ] we perform the search for stability in the neighbourhood of the kam torus .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , in the present section we recall the basic steps that are necessary to introduce the same planar secular model of the sun - jupiter - saturn - uranus system that was already studied in  @xcite .",
    "we defer to sects .  2 and  3 of that paper for more details .",
    "let us consider four point bodies @xmath53 , with masses @xmath54 , mutually interacting according to newton s gravitational law .",
    "hereafter the indexes @xmath55 will correspond to sun , jupiter , saturn and uranus , respectively .",
    "we basically follow the formalism introduced by poincar ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite for a modern exposition ) .",
    "we remove the motion of the center of mass by using heliocentric coordinates @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "denoting by @xmath58 the momenta conjugate to @xmath59 , the hamiltonian of the system has @xmath60 degrees of freedom , and reads @xmath61 where @xmath62    the plane set of poincar s canonical variables is defined as @xmath63 for @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the semi - major axis , the eccentricity , the mean anomaly and the perihelion longitude , respectively , of the @xmath67-th planet .",
    "let us remark that both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are of the same order of magnitude as the eccentricity @xmath70 .",
    "using poincar s variables  ( [ var - poincare - piano ] ) , the hamiltonian @xmath71 can be rearranged so that one has @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 . here , the small dimensionless parameter @xmath75 , @xmath76",
    ", @xmath77 has been introduced in order to highlight the different size of the terms appearing in the hamiltonian . according to the common language in celestial mechanics , in the following",
    "we will refer to @xmath78 and to their conjugate actions @xmath79 as the _ fast variables _ , while @xmath80 will be called _",
    "secular variables_.    we proceed now by expanding the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - iniz - poincare - var ] ) in order to construct the first basic approximation of kolmogorov normal form .",
    "we pick a value @xmath81 for the fast actions and perform a translation @xmath82 defined as @xmath83 this is a canonical transformation that leaves the coordinates @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 unchanged .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian @xmath87 can be expanded in power series of @xmath88 around the origin .",
    "thus , forgetting an unessential constant we rearrange the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath89 where the functions @xmath90 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath91 in the actions @xmath92 and of degree @xmath93 in the secular variables @xmath94 .",
    "the coefficients of such homogeneous polynomials do depend analytically and periodically on the angles @xmath84 .",
    "the terms @xmath95 of the keplerian part are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath91 in the actions @xmath96 , the explicit expression of which can be determined in a straightforward manner . in the latter equation the term which is both linear in the actions and independent of all the other canonical variables ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) has been separated in view of its relevance in perturbation theory , as it will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we also expand the coefficients of the power series @xmath98 in fourier series of the angles @xmath84 , by following a traditional procedure in celestial mechanics .",
    "we work out these expansions for the case of the planar sjsu system using a specially devised algebraic manipulation ( see  @xcite for an introduction to the main ideas that have been translated in our codes ) .

    "unfortunately , in our model of the planetary problem , the initial conditions reported in table  [ tab : freq_condiniz_sec_2d_sjsu ] are far enough from the equilibrium point to induce some effects of numerical instability that are mainly due to the determination of the actions translations ( which will be properly defined in the following ) ; this can prevent the convergence of the algorithm constructing the kam torus . in order to circumvent such an obstruction ,",
