    "in the quest for gravitational waves ( gws ) , a primary role among the possible sources has always been played by those astrophysical events that are expected to produce gw bursts , such as the gravitational collapse of stars or the final few orbits and the subsequent coalescence of a close binary system of neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the search for such transient gw requires the use of a network of detectors .",
    "in fact , the analysis of simultaneous data from more detectors at different sites allows an efficient rejection of the spurious outliers , either caused by transient local disturbances or by the intrinsic noise of the detectors .",
    "resonant gw detectors have operated for decades in several laboratories around the world , reliably staying on the air for long periods with high duty cycle @xcite , mainly looking for burst events .",
    "the coming of age of laser interferometer detectors @xcite , with much better sensitivity and bandwidth , has lead to a gradual phasing out of many resonant detectors .",
    "the rog collaboration has built and operated two cryogenic , resonant - mass detectors , explorer @xcite at cern and nautilus @xcite at the infn frascati national labs(italy ) .",
    "both detectors have been on the air since the early 90s , performing various joint coincidence searches@xcite . in the period",
    "may 5th 2005 to april 15th 2007 they took part in the igec2 network @xcite that collected and exchanged data , together with the auriga detector at the infn legnaro national labs ( italy ) @xcite and with the allegro detector at lsu ( usa ) @xcite .",
    "after that period , allegro was shut down and data have been collected by the three surviving antennas , but never analyzed before .",
    "all these detectors use the same principles of operation .",
    "the gw excites the odd longitudinal modes of the cylindrical bar , which is cooled to cryogenic temperatures to reduce the thermal noise and is isolated from seismic and acoustic disturbances . both explorer and nautilus consist of a large aluminum alloy cylinder ( 3 m long , 0.6 m diameter ) suspended in vacuum by a cable around its central section and cooled to about 2 k by means of a superfluid helium bath . to record the vibrations of the bar first longitudinal mode , an auxiliary mechanical resonator tuned to the same frequency",
    "is bolted on one bar end face .",
    "this resonator is part of a capacitive electro - mechanical transducer that produces an electrical a.c .",
    "current that is proportional to the displacement between the secondary resonator and the bar end face .",
    "such current is then amplified by means of a dcsquid superconductive device .",
    "nautilus is also equipped with a dilution refrigerator that enables operations at 0.1 k , further reducing the thermal noise . in the period",
    "considered , however , the refrigerator was not operational , in order to maximize the detector duty cycle .",
    "both detectors are equipped with cosmic ray telescopes , to veto excitations due to large showers@xcite .",
    "the two telescopes rely on different technologies ( scintillators for explorer , streamer tubes for nautilus ) but both provide a monitor of comparable effectiveness and a continuous check of the antenna sensitivity@xcite .    at present , while the large interferometers virgo and ligo are undergoing massive overhauls to upgrade their sensitivity , there still are two resonant detectors , nautilus and auriga , that continue to operate in `` astro - watch '' mode , i.e. as sentinels recording data that could be analyzed in conjunction with a significant astrophysical trigger , such as the explosion of a nearby supernova , or any astronomical event thought to be a possible source of gw .",
    "we report here a study on three years of data from explorer and nautilus , starting from the end of the igec2 network , april 16,2007 and stretching till june 10 , 2010 , when explorer ceased operations .",
    "the spectral sensitivity of the two detectors is shown in fig.[fig_sh ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a search for short burst coincident events in the 3 years of data .",
    "the main interest of this analysis lies in several novelties that were implemented in the data analysis procedure and that are here detailed ; namely , the construction of _ _ r__eceiver operating characteristics for the 2-detector observatory , in addition to the ones for each antenna , the optimization of the threshold pairs in order to maximize the detection efficiency , given an a - priori choice of the background of accidental coincidences and an optimized procedure for the calculations of upper limits on the rate of gw burst .",
    "the search was carried out keeping a low level of accidental coincidences , that we set at 0.1 over the entire period .",
    "along with this search , we also performed a calculation of the upper limit ( ul ) on the rate of delta - like gw pulses impinging on the earth .",
    "the method here described presents relevant improvements with respect to previously published searches performed with resonant detectors : we have used software injections of known signals to measure the efficiency of detection for each antenna and for the combined observatory . based on the efficiencies so evaluated , and on the measured rate of accidentals , the analysis parameters were separately optimized for the coincidence search and for the ul evaluation .    throughout this paper , we shall call `` events '' or `` outliers '' those data points in the filtered data stream that are larger than a given threshold : these points are selected by an automatic event finder procedure and constitute the database for our analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect.[sect_data ] we describe the data collected in these 3 years , the filtering procedure , the criteria chosen to segment the total observation period in 5 subperiods and the vetos applied to both data and events . in sect.[sect_dect ]",
    "the procedures of software injection and time - delayed coincidences are detailed .",
    "the detectors are characterized in terms of efficiency and accidentals in the various time segments and the rocs are generated , both for the individual antennas and for the combined observatory ; on the basis of these parameters , in sect.[sect_coinci ] the thresholds for the `` true '' ( zero - delay , on time ) coincidence search are chosen and the search is performed . finally , in sect.[sect_ul ]",
    ", we describe the procedure used to compute the upper limit for the flux of gw radiation .",
    "this procedure , quite different from those used in the past , is optimized in each of the subperiods and for each of the amplitudes of gw signals considered .",
    "some final considerations conclude the paper .",
    "data are collected by the two detectors with almost identical hardware and software .",
    "the output of the squid amplifier is conditioned by band pass filtering and by an anti - aliasing low - pass filter , then sampled at 5 khz and stored on disk .",
    "sampling is triggered by a gps disciplined rubidium oscillator , also providing the time stamp for the acquired data .",
    "the data are processed off - line , applying adaptive , frequency domain filters .",
    "we first `` whiten '' the data , i.e. remove the effect of the detector transfer function , producing the so called @xmath1 . a filter matched to delta ( or very short )",
    "excitations is then applied to this stream .",
    "we shall call @xmath2 the output of this process , to remind that the time series so produced does not represent a generic wave amplitude @xmath3 , but is the best effort to detect an impulsive excitation .",
    "the noise characteristics estimate is updated averaging @xmath4 over 10 minutes periods .",
    "the filters used in the above procedure are computed using a model for the detector , fitted with the measured values of frequencies and decay times of the system resonances , and the experimental noise spectrum .",
    "both the model and the signal response were validated by hardware injections of known signals : the filtered output matched the expected value to better than @xmath5 .",
    "as usually done for resonant detectors @xcite , the filtered output @xmath2 is normalized assuming that the excitation lasts @xmath6 and has a bandwidth of @xmath7 centered and flat in the region of the detectors sensitivity .",
    "if these assumptions are fulfilled , the peak value of @xmath2 gives the @xmath8 of the input signal .",
    "the filter is designed and optimized for delta - like signals , but it works equally well @xcite for a wider class of short bursts , like e.g. damped sinusoids with decay time @xmath9 ms .",
    "typical gw signals of this kind and their possible astrophysical sources have been discussed and exposed e.g. in @xcite and references therein .",
    "although the detectors produce quite stationary data , their characteristics did change a few times over such a long observation period : in some instances , these differences were due to actual changes in hardware ( e.g. substitution of a preamplifier ) , other times to some non identified factors .",
    "we found it useful , to the purpose of the study detailed below , to segment the analysis in different periods where both detectors had noise behavior ( average noise energy ) , in terms of a `` detection noise temperature '' @xmath10 .",
    "these two quantities are related , for our detectors , by @xmath11 . in these units , the average noise levels of table i spanned between 0.9 and 4 mk . ]",
    "consistently stable , within the statistical fluctuations .",
    "this allows us to better optimize the search in each period .",
    "consequently , we identified 5 time stretches ( see table i ) , that roughly coincide with solar years , and ran separate optimized analysis on each subperiod .",
    "stretch @xmath12 , the end of 2007 , covers a short period , when nautilus operations were badly disturbed : we shall show that the adopted procedures automatically minimize the contributions from bad periods both for the coincidence search and for the upper limit evaluation .",
    "before we start describing the procedure two comments are in order : + 1 ) when segmenting the data in subperiods to be treated separately , or to run separate optimizations of the search parameters , we must ensure that each subperiod be long enough to provide a sufficient statistics , and in particular to avoid that any particular outlier or temporary noise affect in a sizable way the final choices",
    ". we found that a few days of data is somehow the minimum duration for this purpose .",
    "+ 2 ) if the procedure is properly devised , the addition of any information or data set , however poor its quality with respect to the rest of the data , should not reduce the quality of the total result . on the contrary",
    ", a correct way of putting together all the information can only produce a better result .",
    ".the time stretches @xmath13 used to run different optimization in our analysis .",
    "@xmath14 is the long term average of the amplitude noise [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab_carper ]         upper limit and previously published results .",
    "all ligo and virgo results , and in particular the solid curve ( lv2 ) , refer to @xmath15 uls.,width=302,height=264 ]",
    "fig.[fig_confro ] compares our present results with some other published in the past : the curve labeled `` igec 1 '' is from @xcite , `` igec 2 '' is from @xcite , `` s2 '' is the ul for 1 ms gaussian pulses from the ligo s2 run@xcite , `` s4'',``s5 '' and `` lv2 '' are for q=9 sin - gaussian pulses at 1053 hz from @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .    in the present calculation of ul",
    "there are several choices that make it difficult to compare with previous results .",
    "if we consider the above cited upper limits released by the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) , we can see that no specific optimization was carried out for the ul : all the analysis parameters , and in particular the thresholds , were set for the coincidence search .",
    "the number of _ on - time coincidences _ found was directly used to compute the ul for that run .",
    "we show in fig.[fig_noopt ] what the result of such an analysis strategy would be on our data : the curve labeled `` opt '' represents the optimized ul computed in the previous section while the curve labeled `` fix '' is the result we would obtain with the thresholds determined in the coincidence search .",
    "the improvement in sensitivity , especially at low amplitudes can be clearly seen .",
    "a more relevant issue regards the meaning of the variable @xmath8 , i.e. the abscissa of the ul plot . in the two igec searches @xcite the efficiency of the detectors",
    "was not considered , and the ul was plotted vs the amplitude threshold used in the coincidence search .",
    "what the curve really meant was then the ul on gw rates @xmath16 by the observatory with that threshold , rather than the @xmath17 rate . for a fair comparison ,",
    "at least the efficiency of the detectors should be considered : for a given amplitude @xmath18 , when the threshold is set at that very amplitude @xmath18 , the efficiency is roughly @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of detectors .",
    "the igec ul values should therefore be increased by at least a factor 4 to convert to an @xmath17 rate .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lsc includes in its analysis a model describing the distributions of the gw incoming signals , by folding into the calculation a factor @xmath21 to account for isotropic direction and random polarization of the wave .",
    "the @xmath8 in ligo s ul is then the maximum amplitude detectable by the observatory .",
    "besides , they computed a @xmath22 ul , while ours is at @xmath23 : according to eq.4.1 of @xcite , in order to convert their uls at 95% , they should be increased by a factor @xmath24 .",
    "it s clear that the combination of these two differences , one of which would lead to a decrease of the ul , the other one to an increase , would anyhow not change much the comparison with our results .",
    "it is reasonable to question whether a unique search over the entire observation period @xmath25 would yield a similar or better result with respect to our choice of segmenting the analysis in 5 sub - periods . in other terms , how does the global @xmath26 compare vs the product @xmath27 of 5 separate update ratios ?",
    "an exact answer can be given in the simple case where we segment t in two subperiods having the same characteristics , namely accidentals @xmath28 and efficiency @xmath29 , assumed constant .",
    "in this case , the global ( one period ) * _ r _ *  is given by eq.[eq_rbur ] , while the product of the two * _ r _ * s for the subperiods @xmath30 is : @xmath31    as @xmath32 ( and same for @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 , one can expand eq.[eq_rt ] , and prove * _ r_*@xmath35  * _ r_*@xmath36 , for any choice of @xmath30 , @xmath37 .",
    "for the more general case of two non homogeneous subperiods , although we lack an algebraic proof , extensive numerical investigation has shown that we should always expect * _ r_*@xmath38*_r_*@xmath36 .      in this paper",
    "we analyzed 3 years of almost continuous data from the two resonant gravitational wave detectors explorer and nautilus .",
    "the period examined spans from the end of the igec2 four - detector analysis to the decommissioning of explorer .",
    "both the search for coincidences with low false alarm rate and the evaluation of the upper limit have been performed employing a novel type of analysis , with optimization of the thresholds of each detector separately for each intermediate task .",
    "this method has proven successful in obtaining better results ( see for instance fig.[fig_noopt ] ) as well as for handling non stationarities in the detectors behavior .",
    "as an example , we recall the noisy period of 2007b : in a search with the usual procedure , that period would be discarded , or its large number of events would negatively affect the statistics of the remaining , better data . in our case , the optimized procedure automatically takes care of the higher noise and reduces the weight of that period on the final results . indeed , its contribution to both the coincidence search and the upper limit evaluation is hardly noticeable .",
    "the upper limit computed on the basis of our data can not compete with those of the more sensitive interferometric detectors , that extend down to much smaller @xmath8 values .",
    "nevertheless , the length of our data collection lead us to expect that we could improve upon the ul set by ligo s5 , at amplitudes of the order of @xmath39 : indeed we did obtain a better ul than other previously published . however , while in the process of analyzing our data , a new , improved ul was released by the lsc - virgo collaboration : combining the data of the s5/vsr1 and s6/vsr2 - 3 runs , the extended data taking allowed them to set a better limit also at higher amplitudes .",
    "the procedure detailed here could be profitably used in future searches , where better sensitivity of the detectors would yield even more significant uls .",
    "infact , we demonstrated ( see fig.[fig_noopt ] ) that this procedure grants a substantial improvement in the evaluation of the upper limit , up to two orders of magnitude at low amplitudes , with respect to the standard way of computing it .",
    "explorer ceased taking data on june 11th , 2010 , concluding an activity that spanned over a quarter of a century .",
    "we take the opportunity of this last scientific paper produced with its data to thank cern as an institution for hospitality and provision of facilities , first and foremost the cryogenic fluids .",
    "we also thank the numerous cern officials and staff that provided , over such a long period , with logistics and with daily as well as emergency help .",
    "+ we are grateful to the technicians ( too numerous to name them all ) that , over the years , helped us maintaining both detectors in operations and , to these days , still work to keep nautilus on the air .",
