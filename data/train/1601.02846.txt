    "the viewpoint of anomalous heat transport in one - dimensional ( 1d ) momentum conserved systems has now been widely accepted  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly means that the  standard \" heat transport law , i.e. , the fourier s law of heat conduction , stating that , the heat flux @xmath1 is proportional to the temperature gradient @xmath2 : @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the heat conductivity assumed to be constant , is not validated .",
    "in particular , for 1d anharmonic oscillator systems with conserved momentum and symmetric interparticle interactions , it has now been generally believed that @xmath4 is not a constant but follows a simple space @xmath5 scaling @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "( for the momentum - conserving systems with asymmetric interactions , refer to the recent progress  @xcite and debates  @xcite ) . despite",
    "that there is still no consensus on the universality classes of the scaling exponent @xmath7 and its accurate value(s ) , in most cases @xmath8  @xcite can be concluded .",
    "this power - law space scaling has also been corroborated by some relevant experimental studies of carbon nanotubes  @xcite .    nevertheless , there are still two exceptional systems with both conserved momentum and symmetric interactions against the above belief , i.e. , the 1d coupled rotator system and the chain with a double - well ( dw ) potential . for both systems a transition ( or crossover ) from superdiffusive to normal heat transport ( obeys the fourier s law , @xmath9 ) has been claimed to take place .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to understand the observed normal transport in rotator systems .",
    "early works related the mechanism to the occurrence of phase jump  @xcite and the excitation of high - frequency stationary localized rotational modes  @xcite . while quite recently the mechanism has been traced back to the viscosity indicated from momentum diffusion  @xcite and the absence of the conserved quantity of stretch from the perspective of nonlinear fluctuation hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "however , when one turns to the bounded dw system , the underlying mechanism of normal transport has not yet been clarified so far .",
    "even worse , whether the transport would be normal or abnormal remains controversial : early results indicated that heat conduction is normal at low temperatures  @xcite , nevertheless it was doubted later by  @xcite .",
    "two recent works revisited the issue and suggested that normal behavior may appear in a narrow temperature region near @xmath10  @xcite . in a quite recent work",
    ", we also have shown convincing evidences for this normal behavior  @xcite , however , the underlying mechanisms are still not very clear .    in the present work",
    "we perform a further careful examination on the unusual heat transport and its underlying mechanisms in the 1d dw oscillator systems . for this purpose",
    "we shall first focus on the heat spreading process . to study heat transport ,",
    "usually the space scaling exponent @xmath7 is given the most attention , for which there are now two main kinds of numerical approaches , i.e. , direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite and the method based on green - kubo formula  @xcite .",
    "however , just as raised by s. olla in a discussion session of a recent workshop  @xcite : the studies employing both methods for deriving @xmath7 usually ignored another key time scale . as concerning time",
    "scaling may involve more detailed information , which would present a more detailed prediction of heat transport , here we shall investigate the relaxation of equilibrium heat fluctuations of the system to derive the space - time scaling to characterize the heat transport behavior .",
    "we shall explore how this space - time scaling would depend on the system temperature , through which we are able to verify that , normal transport is indeed likely to take place under certain temperature regimes .    to further understand this normal transport",
    "we shall also carefully examine the relaxation of other two physical quantities fluctuations , i.e. , the total energy and momentum .",
    "we will show clear distinctions between the spreading of heat and the total energy . from the momentum spreading",
    "we will reveal the emerging of viscosity ( under some temperature regimes ) ; nevertheless , we find that this viscosity can not be directly attributed to the observed normal heat transport . a careful analysis of the system s phonons spectra indicates that",
    ", around the crossover temperature point of @xmath11 , phonons clearly tend to become softest . based on both facts",
    ", we further conjecture that , under the appropriate temperature , phonons softening , together with the viscosity from momentum diffusion , may result in the observed normal heat transport in dw systems .",
    "the focused model is a 1d oscillator system , whose hamiltonian reads : @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the displacement of the @xmath14th particle from its equilibrium position and @xmath15 its momentum .",
    "the mass @xmath16 is set to unit .",
    "the potential takes the bounded dw type as @xmath17    -.2 cm -0.4 cm   vs temperature @xmath18 , where the circles , stars and triangles correspond to the results of space size @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; and from left to right , the vertical dashed lines denote @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] -0.3 cm    such a system is very peculiar .",
    "first , equation ( 2 ) is a extension of fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) interactions to the particular bounded dw type , which is usually adopted to model the structural phase transition  @xcite .",
    "we have plotted the order parameter @xmath24 , the ensemble average of adjacent particles relative displacement ( from their equilibrium positions ) , as a function of temperature @xmath18 for several space sizes @xmath5 ( see figure 1 ) and verified that , for a potential like eq .",
    "( 2 ) , regardless of @xmath5 , there is a phase transition region around @xmath25-@xmath26 . the second point worth noting",
    "is that this system does not bare linear - wave dynamics ( with the unusual phonon dispersion )  @xcite , thus whether the linear phonon dynamics would still apply should be further tested .",
    "we expect that such two unusual features may affect heat transport and to understand how they may is thus interesting .",
    "to identify the space - time scaling exponent for heat transport , usually one can investigate the decay of energy pulses or the equilibrium energy fluctuations correlation  @xcite .",
    "however , studying the energy pluses decay may be unable to avoid huge statistical fluctuations  @xcite , hence , here we apply the equilibrium correlation method for our investigations .",
    "this correlation approach was first proposed by zhao  @xcite for studying the total energy fluctuations spreading and then extended to be applicable to investigate both heat and other physical quantities fluctuations decay  @xcite . for further detailed implementation",
    ", one can also refer to  @xcite .",
    "we shall mainly focus on the following three normalized spatiotemporal correlation functions of the three main physical quantities fluctuations , i.e. , the heat energy , the total energy and momentum , defined as follows  @xcite @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 respectively ; where @xmath30 represents the spatiotemporal average ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the heat energy , the total energy and momentum densities in an equal and appropriate lattice bin @xmath37 ( the number of particles in the @xmath37-th bin is equal to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total number of the bins ) , respectively . for any particle in each bin , @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "are the single - particle s total energy and momentum at the absolute displacement @xmath42 and time @xmath43 ; @xmath44  @xcite is the particle s heat energy , with @xmath45 the corresponding mass density function , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 the spatiotemporally averaged energy ( mass ) density and the internal pressure of the system in equilibrium state , respectively .",
    "note that to calculate our correlation functions , here we should have to discretize the space into several bins , thus the space variable should be the absolute displacement @xmath42 rather than the label @xmath14 of the particle .",
    "we emphasize that such a key coarse - grained procedure may significantly affect the final results  @xcite .    the correlation functions @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are employed to characterize the probability density functions ( pdf ) profiles of the spatiotemporal spreading of the initial physical quantities fluctuations .",
    "if these pdf profiles have been obtained , then a space - time scaling analysis may enable us to identify the corresponding transport manners .    as to our simulations",
    ", we assume the number of particles equal to the space size @xmath5 , then in view of the symmetric potential of the system , the averaged pressure is fixed at zero throughout the simulations .",
    "we mainly consider two cases of space size @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which enables us to obtain an effective space size ( about @xmath54 ) for a long time up to @xmath55 for the spreading .",
    "for each @xmath5 , we apply the periodic boundary conditions , fix the bins number @xmath56 , and set the lattice constant @xmath57 .",
    "we utilize the stochastic langevin heat baths  @xcite to thermalize the system for preparing the canonical equilibrium systems ( with fixed @xmath18 ) and employ the runge - kutta algorithm of @xmath58th to @xmath59th order with a time step @xmath60 to evolve the system .",
    "the equilibrium systems are prepared by evolving the systems for a long enough time ( @xmath61 time units of the models ) from properly assigned initial random states , then all the systems are evolved in isolation for deriving the correlation information .",
    "the size of the ensemble for deriving the correlations is about @xmath62 .",

    "the lowest temperature considered here is fixed at @xmath22 , up to which we have verified that the final results are insensitive to the initial states assigned to just one of the potential wells , or alternately , or randomly . from figure 2",
    "it can been clearly seen that the shapes of the profiles under different temperatures are different : while for a low temperature @xmath22 and a high temperature @xmath65 one can identify one central peak and two side peaks ; in some intermediate temperature ranges , such as @xmath66 and @xmath23 , the side peaks seem to disappear .",
    "thus , the latter cases of @xmath66 and @xmath23 look like gaussian distributions that are usually exhibited in normal transport ; while for the cases that the side peaks do not disappear , the pdf profiles are in good coincidence with lvy walks stable distributions for describing superdiffusive transport  @xcite",

    "cm    viewing this coincidence , we perform a lvy scaling analysis for the pdf profiles central parts @xmath68 which then enables us to identify a scaling exponent @xmath69 for precisely characterizing the heat transport process .",
    "we recall that usually @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 correspond to the ballistic , superdiffusive , and normal transport , respectively .    -.2 cm -0.4 cm   shown in fig . 2 : ( a ) @xmath22 ( @xmath73 ) ; ( b ) @xmath66 ( @xmath74 ) ; ( c ) @xmath23 ( @xmath75 ) ; and ( d ) @xmath65 ( @xmath76 ) , respectively .",

    ", heat can be superdiffusive while energy shows strong localizations .",
    "this unusual result thus suggests that we should take care to derive a general connection between heat conduction and energy diffusion ; rather , it may be more reasonable to connect heat conduction to heat spreading .",
    "the momentum spreading is shown to have the most viscosity around a second turning point of @xmath127 ; however , this point of @xmath127 can not directly correspond to the crossover point of heat spreading ( @xmath90 ) .",
