    "unlike virtually all other astronomical objects , ly@xmath0 absorbing `` clouds '' were first discovered at great distances ( @xmath72 ) due to cosmological redshifts and the near - uv atmospheric `` cutoff '' .",
    "it has only been with the advent of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , with access to the ultraviolet , that nearby examples have been found and studied .",
    "one of the major unexpected discoveries made during the first year of hst was that the numerous ly@xmath0 absorption lines found at high-@xmath3 persist , albeit with fewer numbers , into the present epoch ( bahcall et  al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; morris et  al .",
    "1991 ; and subsequent hst qso absorption - line key project papers by jannuzi et  al .",
    "1998 and weymann et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "extrapolations of the steep redshift dependence of the number evolution of the lines seen at early times had predicted that very few low-@xmath3 ly@xmath0 lines would be found . while these absorbers likely account for the majority of all baryons at @xmath72 ,",
    "their still substantial numbers at @xmath3@xmath10 imply that @xmath820% of all baryons remain in these clouds locally ( shull , penton & stocke 1999a ; penton et  al .",
    "2000b ; dav et  al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "thus , any account of the present - day distribution of baryons must include an accurate census of these clouds , and the mass associated with them , as inferred from their column densities and physical extent .",
    "further , the evolving thermodynamic properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are probed using these clouds , as measurements of their doppler widths ( @xmath9 ) reveal information about their temperatures .",
    "observations of the changing @xmath9 distribution and metal content of ly@xmath0 absorbers with time reveal the history of energy and metal injection into the igm from @xmath10 to the present .",
    "although it is already clear that much or even most of the baryons could be in the local igm , this number is quite uncertain , depending as it does on two poorly known quantities : ( 1 ) * cloud extent * : physical extent measurements come only from common absorbers found in close pairs of qso sightlines and suggest extents of 100 - 300 @xmath11  kpc , but are difficult to interpret ; see impey ( 1999 ) .",
    "very large and elongated `` clouds '' are suggested by cosmological simulations ( cen et  al .",
    "1994 ; dav et  al .",
    "1999 ) , but sightline pairs alone can not measure `` cloud '' shapes ; ( 2 ) * ionized fraction * : photoionized models of ly@xmath0 absorbers use the local agn luminosity function ( e.g. , shull et  al . 1999 ) or limits on igm h  i cloud h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , donahue et  al .",
    "1995 ) to estimate the intensity and spectrum of the local igm ionizing flux . as has been stressed by several authors ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et  al .",
    "2000 ) , as many as 30 - 40% of all baryons could be in a hot , shock - ionized phase , outside galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "if so , the ionized fraction of many ly@xmath0 absorbers has been underestimated by using photoionization models , and the majority of local baryons are in the igm , not in galaxies .",
    "however , one must take care not to `` double count '' individual absorbers that are detected both in ly@xmath0 and o  vi , but only to make sure that an appropriate ionized fraction is used in the accounting .    while the above census is ample reason for studying the local ly@xmath0 forest in detail , it is also only at low-@xmath3 that ly@xmath0 absorber locations can be compared accurately with galaxy locations , so that the relationship between these `` clouds '' and galaxies can be determined",
    "the degree to which absorbers correlate with galaxies has been controversial ; lanzetta et  al ( 1995 ) and chen et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that the absorbers are the very extended halos of galaxies ( see also lin et al .",
    "2000 ; linder 2000 ) , while morris et  al .",
    "1993 ; stocke et  al .",
    "1995 ; impey , petry & flint 1999 ; dav et  al .",
    "1999 and penton et  al .",
    "2000b argue that the absorbers are related to galaxies only through their common association with large - scale gaseous filaments .",
    "surprisingly , and luckily for local igm research , the modest hst aperture is competitive with the 10 m aperture of the keck telescope ( @xmath12hires spectrograph ) in detecting ly@xmath0 absorbers because much brighter targets can be observed .",
    "figure  1 shows an hst@xmath12stis ( space telescope imaging spectrograph ) far - uv spectrum of the bright bl lac object pks 2005 - 489 , which detects ly@xmath0 absorbers with column density , n@xmath13 @xmath5 , as low as the best keck hires data ( e.g. , cowie et  al .",
    "1995 ) . for reference to other h",
    "i work in this conference , these absorbers have @xmath110@xmath2 times lower column densities than the weakest detections using the 21 cm emission line .",
    "the results reported here come chiefly from an on - going survey of the local ly@xmath0 `` forest '' , which utlilizes spectra like that shown in figure  1 , and which is being conducted by our group at colorado , in collaboration with j. van gorkom ( columbia ) , c. carilli and j. hibbard ( nrao ) , and r. weymann and m. rauch ( ociw ) .",
    "these uv spectra also allow important studies ( i.e. , metallicities ) of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) not possible by other methods and which bear critically on the nature of these hvcs ( see gibson et al .",
    "contribution to this volume ) .",
    "all specific results reported here use only the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) portion of our dataset , which includes 15 targets ( penton et  al .",
    "2000a , b , 2001 ) .",
    "fifteen additional targets have now been observed using stis , which will extend the current results significantly . from our ghrs survey",
    "the following results have been obtained :    1 .",
    "although only 116,000kms@xmath14 in pathlength has been observed in our ghrs survey , we have detected 81 ( @xmath84@xmath15 ) absorbers at @xmath1620,000 kms@xmath14 , yielding a @xmath17200 per unit redshift at n@xmath1810@xmath19@xmath5 or one `` cloud '' every 20@xmath20 mpc !",
    "the 20% baryon fraction quoted above uses this line density , a 100 @xmath20 kpc spherical cloud extent and the standard 10@xmath21ergss@xmath14 @xmath5hz@xmath14 sr@xmath14 local ionizing flux value",
    "( shull et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "figure  2 compares line densities as a function of redshift for two column density regimes : ( 1 ) n@xmath1810@xmath22@xmath5 from the bechtold ( 1994 ) high-@xmath3 compilation and the hst key project low-@xmath3 results of weymann et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; and ( 2 ) 10@xmath23n@xmath2410@xmath22@xmath5 from kim et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) at high-@xmath3 and our ghrs survey at @xmath250.067 .",
    "the overall trend in these two different column density regimes appears similar , and has been interpreted using n - body + hydrodynamic simulations ( dav et  al .",
    "1999 ) as follows : ( 1 ) at @xmath71.6 , the expansion of the universe plus a nearly constant ionizing flux greatly diminishes recombinations ( i.e. , the clouds are more highly ionized at lower redshift to @xmath262 ) , but ( 2 ) at @xmath251.6 , the rapidly falling ionizing flux ( due to the diminished luminosities of agn at @xmath251.6 ) partially offsets the decreasing recombinations , slowing the rapid evolution in @xmath27 seen at higher @xmath3 .",
    "but , there is some indication of added complications in that the two column density regimes may evolve at different rates in @xmath27 . at high-@xmath3 , the kim et  al .",
    "data may have a shallower slope than the bechtold data . at low-@xmath3 ,",
    "weymann et  al .",
    "find that their lower column density absorbers have a shallower slope in @xmath27 than their higher - n@xmath28 absorbers .",
    "spectra now being obtained by jannuzi et  al . in hst cycles 8 and 9 ( pid # 8312 & # 8673 )",
    "should address this issue by filling - in the missing data near the question marks .",
    "it could even be that the lower column density absorbers may actually increase in numbers between @xmath291.0 and 0 .",
    "the absorber @xmath9-value distribution at @xmath290 is similar to that found at high-@xmath3 , with a median @xmath9-value of 35kms@xmath14 .",
    "no obvious correlation between @xmath9 and n@xmath28 is found .",
    "however , when compared to @xmath9-values obtained from a curve - of - growth ( cog ) analysis using higher - order lyman lines ( shull et al .",
    "2000 ) from spectra obtained with the far uv spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) , ly@xmath0 line widths are a factor factor of two higher than the @xmath9-values inferred from the cog .",
    "the fuse data suggest that local ly@xmath0 absorbers contain sizable nonthermal motions arising from cosmological expansion and infall . measuring the actual @xmath9-values of these clouds",
    "is necessary to determine the igm `` effective equation of state '' ( hui & gnedin 1997 ; ricotti , gnedin & shull 2000 ) and thus when heat has been input into the igm .",
    "higher resolution hst spectra and more fuse spectroscopy of low - column - density absorbers are now being obtained to measure the @xmath9-values and clustering ( see next item ) of these clouds more precisely .",
    "the two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) , which measures the clustering of ly@xmath0 absorbers , is similar to that found at high-@xmath3 in that there is a 4@xmath15 excess power over random at @xmath16200 km s@xmath14 .",
    "impey , petry & flint ( 1999 ) found a similar result using lower resolution spectra .",
    "the absence of significant clustering of these absorbers is strong evidence that ly@xmath0 clouds do not arise in galaxy halos , although some investigators ( impey & bothun 1997 ; linder 2000 ) suggest that this may indicate that low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxy halos may be reponsible .",
    "4 .   using available bright galaxy redshift surveys , we have searched for the nearest known galaxies to these absorbers and have found no close matches among a subset of 45 absorbers in sky regions surveyed down to at least @xmath30 .",
    "typical nearest - neighbor distances are several hundred kpc to a few mpc ( median 1 mpc ) for h@xmath31=75kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 .",
    "seven of these absorbers lie in well - defined galaxy voids , with no known galaxies within 2 - 5@xmath20mpc .",
    "deep optical and 21 cm observations still in progress have failed to locate any galaxies close to these `` void '' absorbers ( mclin et  al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution of distances to nearest - neighbor galaxies and the correlation of equivalent widths ( ew ) with impact parameters ( @xmath32 ) found by penton et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) are similar to those published previously ( stocke et  al .",
    "1995 ) . in the latter case , they are similar to the results found by tripp , lu & savage ( 1998 ) and impey , petry & flint ( 1999 ) .",
    "the ew-@xmath32 correlation contains all the salient features ( lack of correlation at low - n@xmath28 ) expected from the n - body+hydrodynamic simulations of dav et  al .",
    "dav et  al .",
    "interpret this plot as due to large - scale structure filaments ; the ew-@xmath32 correlation does * not * require either a physical or a causal association with individual galaxy halos as proposed by lanzetta et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and lin et  al .",
    "our tpcf results and discovery of a substantial fraction ( @xmath116% ) of all absorbers in voids supports the dav et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) interpretation",
    "in one case , the sightline pair 3c273/q1230@xmath12011 separated by 0.91@xmath33 on the sky , we have a preliminary indication that both the 7 absorbers and 9 known galaxies in this vicinity are aligned along a single ( @xmath34kpc ) , elongated ( @xmath353:1 ) filament at @xmath36=1000@xmath372000kms@xmath14 .",
    "this preliminary result ( penton et  al . 2001 ) suggests that eventually , perhaps with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on hst , we will be able to use ly@xmath0 absorbers and galaxy survey data ( e.g. sloan survey ) to map out the full extent of large - scale structure filaments in the local universe .",
    "7 .   for one case , a close grouping of ly@xmath0 absorbers at @xmath38 17,000kms@xmath14 in the direction of pks 2155 - 304",
    ", we have good metallicity limits ( shull et  al .",
    "1998 ) for low column density absorbers that lie far from galaxies . figure 3 shows the pks 2155 - 304 field , overlaid with 21 cm emission contours ( also at @xmath3917,000kms@xmath14 ) from the vla .",
    "deep optical galaxy survey work ( mclin et  al .",
    "this volume ) has failed to find fainter galaxies closer to the absorbers than the h  i emitters , reinforcing the importance of the vla in this program .",
    "no metal lines ( c  iv and si  iii ) have been detected as yet in the several strong ly@xmath0 systems at this redshift , placing upper limits on the metallicity of these clouds of @xmath401% solar .",
    "+ the metallicity result in # 7 is still preliminary , awaiting better h  i column densities and metal - line measurements from new hst ( stis ) and fuse spectra .",
    "also on - going is an attempt to map the extent of metals in the igm around galaxies using c  iv observations for a subset of local , partially saturated absorbers found in our ghrs survey , in conjunction with the available pencil - beam galaxy survey data .",
    "preliminary results suggest that metals have been spread up to @xmath1150@xmath20kpc from galaxies ( stocke et  al.2001 , in preparation ) , in agreement with simulations by gnedin ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , since we have found at least one absorber that is undetected in c  iv , c  iii and c  ii but has strong o  vi absorption ( tripp et  al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) , any metallicity result based on lower ionization species alone must be viewed with caution .",
    "the existence of this one ly@xmath0 @xmath12 o vi absorber is additional evidence for these shock - heated `` clouds '' ( see tripp contribution to this volume ) .",
    "we note that virtually all o  vi absorbers ( the dav et  al .",
    "`` hot - warm '' phase ) should be detectable in ly@xmath0 and present in our ghrs survey .",
    "therefore , it is important not to `` double count '' absorbers when determining the total baryon content of the local ly@xmath0 `` forest '' .",
    "finally , the pks 2155 - 304 field in figure 3 underscores the important role to be played by the vla in this work .",
    "virtually all of the very close ( @xmath41200h@xmath42 ) absorber - galaxy pairs to date are h  i - discovered galaxies , including the closest impact parameter in our ghrs sample ( 100@xmath20 kpc in the mrk335 sightline ; van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ) as well as the close proximity of the haynes - giovanelli h i cloud to the 3c273 and q1230 + 011 sightlines ( penton et  al .",
    "only h  i 21 cm observations are unbiased against the discovery of lsb galaxies , which have been suggested to be responsible for some local ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "over the next few years , we expect that our own work , as well as that of others , will increase the accuracy of every result in items # 1 - 5 above , including a revised value for the local baryon content of the igm which is probably accurate to 50% .",
    "the @xmath27 relationship will be known in detail for both the high and low column density absorbers .",
    "future work on items # 6 and # 7 will determine whether ly@xmath0 absorbers arise in large - scale structures or in very extended galaxy halos .",
    "if the former ( which we strongly suspect based upon our own investigations ) some local ly@xmath0 absorbers will be found which were never `` polluted '' with metals from the galaxies which co - habit the universal filamentary structure with them .",
