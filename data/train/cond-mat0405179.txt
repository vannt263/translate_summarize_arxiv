    "our understanding of conventional superconductors is based on the bcs theory of cooper pairing induced by electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the electrons pair up in the superconducting phase with the most symmetric pair wave function possible , i.e. in the s - wave orbital and spin - singlet channel .",
    "according to anderson ( 1959 ) this type of pairing requires time reversal symmetry , because the paired electrons need to be in degenerate states of opposite momentum and opposite spin @xcite .",
    "this theorem guarantees that the conventional superconducting phase remains stable even , if a sample is dirty as long as time reversal symmetry is present and allows us to construct degenerate electron pairs with vanishing total momentum .",
    "the situation becomes more complex for unconventional superconductivity with cooper pairs of lower symmetry .",
    "impurities of all kind are detrimental to such pairing due to the momentum averaging effect of random potential scattering .",
    "for clean samples new symmetry criteria have been formulated by anderson ( 1984 ) @xcite .",
    "while spin - singlet pairing only requires time reversal symmetry , spin - triplet pairing also requires inversion symmetry",
    ". these symmetries are present in most materials and no discussion on this issue is usually required .    motivated by the recent discovery of the heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath0si which has no inversion center , we will discuss the magnetic properties of the superconducting phase @xcite while the absence of an inversion center does not imply immediately unusual behavior of the superconducting phase special interest in this case has arisen with the observation that the upper critical field dramatically exceeds the paramagnetic limit . for heavy fermion superconductors the coherence length is generally rather short , roughly 100  , giving rise to large orbital depairing fields .",
    "thus , if there were a paramagnetic limiting effect , then it would be likely be observed ; as for example in cecoin@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "cept@xmath0si has a critical temperature of @xmath2 and a zero - temperature extrapolated upper critical field of 5 tesla .",
    "the estimated paramagnetic limit is a factor 5 smaller than @xmath3 ( @xmath4 tesla ) @xcite .",
    "paramagnetic limiting is expected for spin - singlet pairing , as the zeeman coupling to the spins would break up the cooper pairs . since cooper pairs in spin - triplet configurations would not be destroyed by spin polarization , it might be concluded that spin - triplet pairing is realized in cept@xmath0si .",
    "however , the absence of an inversion center appears to be an obstacle for spin - triplet pairing .",
    "it has been shown that broken inversion symmetry is not indiscriminately destructive for the spin - triplet pairing , and , additionally , it softens the effect of the paramagnetic depairing for spin - singlet pairs @xcite .",
    "for many trpes of crystal lattices , the absence of an inversion center introduces an antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , analogous to the well - known rashba type of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "naturally this influences the cooper pairing through the modification of the band structure as shown by various groups @xcite",
    ".    we would like to discuss here the problem of the spin susceptibility of the superconducting phase , since this is also directly connected with the issue of paramagnetic limiting .",
    "the spin susceptibility measured by means of the nmr - knight shift in the superconducting phase is often used to distinguish between spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairing .",
    "we will show here that this kind of discrimination between the two types of states is not generally possible anymore . rigorously speaking it is , of course , not possible to separate spin - singlet and triplet in the presence of soc .",
    "we will consider here weak soc which we can turn on adiabatically to follow the evolution of the originally well - defined singlet and triplet pairing states .",
    "our basic result is that the spin susceptibility of the spin - singlet states gradually approaches the behavior of the spin - triplet state which survives the presence of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "moreover we can predict that the spin susceptibility for fields along the z - axis of the tetragonal crystal lattice of cept@xmath0si would be less suppressed than for fields along the basal plane .",
    "for the following discussion we will use the model introduced by frigeri et al .",
    "@xcite for cept@xmath0si , which has the following single - particle hamiltonian :    @xmath5_{ss ' } c_{{{\\small \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}}s}^{\\dag } c_{{{\\small \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}}s ' } \\label{eq-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with momentum @xmath8 and spin @xmath9 .",
    "the band energy @xmath10 is measured relative to the chemical potential @xmath11 and @xmath12 introduces the antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling with @xmath13 as a coupling constant ( we set @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the average over the fermi surface ) .    we give here a brief discussion on the origin and some basic properties of the antisymmetric soc . in a crystal lattice",
    "the electrons move in a periodic potential @xmath16 . in the absence of inversion symmetry",
    "there is no symmetry point in the unit cell relative to which @xmath17 is satisfied .",
    "this also implies that the bloch function does not have the property that @xmath18 .",
    "ignoring for the moment relativistic effects , the potential yields the following contribution to the single - particle hamiltonian : @xmath19 the integral runs over the unit cell of the lattice .",
    "the resulting potential @xmath20 is even in @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 . on this ( non - relativistic ) level",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry does not affect the band structure which remains symmetric under the operation @xmath23 due to time reversal symmetry , i.e. the fact that @xmath24 .",
    "now we include the soc .",
    "the symmetric soc of each ion couples different atomic orbitals and requires a multi - orbital description . in this way",
    "the spins would be converted into pseudospins which can be handled formally in the same way as the original spins . for our purpose",
    "the most important influence of this would be an anisotropic @xmath25-tensor which could be straightforwardly introduced into the following discussion and would affect the susceptibility of the normal and superconducting phase in the same way . for the sake of simplicity , however , we will keep here the @xmath25-tensor isotropic .",
    "moreover we ignore the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the pairing interaction .    for a lattice without",
    "inversion symmetry soc already appears on the level of a single - band model yielding the second term in eq.([eq-1 ] ) @xcite .",

    "it is now clear that the hamiltonian @xmath37 is invariant under time reversal @xmath38 but not under inversion operation @xmath39 , because    @xmath40    the soc yields a modified band structure .",

    "the band splits into two spin dependent parts with energies @xmath45 .",
    "the spinor is twisted on the two bands in a way that is described by the antisymmetric part of the green s function , @xmath46 .",
    "now we turn to the superconducting phase and introduce the general pairing interaction @xmath47 the interaction satisfies the relations @xmath48 to assure that the fermion sign and the time reversal symmetry ( @xmath49 ) are preserved .    for the following calculations it is advantageous to discuss the superconducting phase by means of green s functions @xmath50 where the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 are expressed in the heisenberg representation .",
    "these green s functions have to satisfy gorkov equations of the following form @xmath53\\hat{g}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},i\\omega_n)=          \\hat{\\sigma}_0 . \\\\          \\hat{f}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},i\\omega_n)=\\hat{g}_{0}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},i\\omega_n)\\hat{\\delta}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$ } } } )          \\hat{g}^{\\top}(-{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},-i\\omega_n ) .",

    "the gap equations for the spin - singlet and triplet channel are coupled @xcite and thus the gap function is a mixture of both channels .",
    "however , this coupling is of the order @xmath62 which we take to be small ( @xmath63 : the fermi energy , or analogue to the band width ) .",
    "consequently , we ignore this coupling and consider the singlet and triplet channels separately . in particular , it manifests itself in two ways .",
    "it gives rise to different magnitude gaps on the two soc spilt fermi surface sheets .",
    "it should also be observable through a non - vanishing spin - current contribution in the excess current associated with andreev scattering .",
    "it has been shown that once @xmath64 for the spin - triplet channel , then the only spin - triplet state that is permitted satisfies @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 and solve in sequence the equations ( [ green1 ] , [ green2 ] , [ green3 ] ) .",
    "the solutions are formally the same for both singlet ( @xmath67 ) and triplet [ @xmath68 with @xmath65 ] pairing .",
    "we find @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 \\hat{\\delta}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$ } } } ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\hat{f}^{\\dag}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},i\\omega_n)&=&\\hat{\\delta}^{\\dag}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$ } } } ) [ f_+({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},i \\omega_n)\\hat{\\sigma}_{0}+({\\hat{\\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}}}_{{{\\small \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$ } } } } \\cdot \\hat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$ } } } ) f_- ( { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}},i\\omega_n ) ] \\nonumber\\\\         f_\\pm({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$ } } } , i\\omega_n)&= & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\frac{1           } { ( \\omega_{n}^{2}+|\\delta|^{2}+e^{2}_{+ } ) } \\pm \\frac{1           } { ( \\omega_{n}^{2}+|\\delta|^{2}+e^{2}_{- } ) } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the anomalous green s function has less symmetry than the gap function .",
    "in particular , @xmath73 is either symmetric ( singlet ) or antisymmetric ( triplet ) with respect to @xmath23 , while the resulting anomalous green s function has both a symmetric and an antisymmetric component .",
    "this leads to the mixing of the spin - singlet and spin - triplet cooper pairs and has been discussed by gorkov and rashba in the case of 2d metals @xcite .",
    "however @xmath74 is an odd function in @xmath75 and does nt contribute to the gap equation in its weak coupling formulation . in this way the magnitude of the gap @xmath76 for the singlet s - wave order parameter can be approximated by the standard and universal @xmath77 gap equation ,    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is expressed in units of @xmath80 , @xmath81 in units of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 correspond to the euler constant .",
    "the deviation will be of the order @xmath85 , with @xmath86 the cut - off energy of the attractive interaction , which is small in our case .",
    "for the protected spin - triplet state ( @xmath87 ) we have @xmath88 , and to avoid numerical complication superfluous for the following discussion , we have set @xmath89 .",
    "in materials with a spatial inversion center , the measurement of the knight shift in the resonance frequency ( @xmath90 ) by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is an important experimental tool in determining the nature of the superconducting state . in particular",
    ", it allows the determination of the spin structure of the cooper pairs .",
    "the measurement of the temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath91 is a direct measure of the behavior of the spin susceptibility of the superconducting state @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the spin - susceptibility of the normal state ) . for spin - singlet superconductors",
    "it is known that the paramagnetic susceptibility is proportional to the density of normal electrons , which vanishes at zero temperature . in the spin - triplet case",
    ", the spin of the cooper pairs can contribute to the susceptibility .",
    "in particular , if the external field ( @xmath94 ) is parallel to the spin of the cooper pair ( @xmath95 ) , then the susceptibility coincides with that of the fermi - liquid normal state .",
    "this property was used to experimentally confirm spin - triplet superconductivity , for example , in sr@xmath96ruo@xmath97 @xcite .    in principle , for materials with strong spin - orbit coupling , the total magnetic susceptibility can not be split into separate orbital and spin parts . however , if @xmath98 it is possible to isolate the two components @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin susceptibility tensor @xmath99 in the superconducting state can be expressed as    @xmath100    if we assume a spherical fermi surface and a constant density of states @xmath101 close to the fermi surface , then we can replace the sum over @xmath21 by @xmath102 . in the normal state",
    "the integral over @xmath103 can not be carried out before the sum over @xmath104 because the regular green s function will be formally divergent @xcite .",
    "doing the sum first , we find that the normal state spin susceptibility corresponds with the pauli susceptibility @xmath105",
    ". this would not be the case if electron - hole asymmetry is taken into account ( i.e if @xmath106 ) .",
    "for our purposes this is an unnecessary complication which we will neglect here .    to avoid carrying out the summation over @xmath107 in the superconducting state",
    ", we follow abrikosov et al . and sum and subtract the expression corresponding to the normal state @xcite .",
    "the integral of the difference between the integrands rapidly converge in this case .",
    "consequently , the order of summation and integration can be interchanged . for a singlet gap function",
    "we find a generalization of the result obtained by gorkov and rashba @xcite and bulaevskii et al @xcite : @xmath108    for the triplet gap function ( with @xmath109 ) the susceptibility is independent of @xmath61 @xmath110 more precisely , the contribution due to @xmath61 from the regular green s function is cancelled out by the contribution of the anomalous green s function .",
    "we now apply the results to the recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath0si @xcite . in this case , the generating point group symmetry is @xmath111 for which the simplest form of @xmath112 is @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "this has the same form as the well - known rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",

    "however , our approach illustrates the behavior expected at a qualitative level .",
    "more precisely , the susceptibility , independent of the kind of pairing and of the strength of the soc , is more strongly suppressed in the ab - plane than along the c - axis .",
    "this angle dependence of the static uniform susceptibility should be confirmed by nmr - knight - shift measurements .",
    "moreover , our discussion supports the conclusion of frigeri et al . that the spin `` singlet '' pairing state acquires a certain robustness against pair breaking due to spin polarization @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of the zero - temperature limiting field is obtained by comparison of superconducting condensation and spin polarization energy , leading to @xmath131 in principle this can become very big for fields along the @xmath132-axis and roughly 1- 2 tesla for fields in the basal plane .",
    "we have determined the spin susceptibility in superconductors without inversion symmetry .",
    "while the spin - triplet and spin - singlet order parameters are mixed in general , we can discuss predominantly spin - triplet or spin - singlet gaps when the spin orbit coupling is much smaller than the band width .",

    "we have predicted that , independent of the pairing symmetry , the susceptibility is more strongly suppressed in the ab - plane than along the c - axis .",
