    "strangeness production from photon - nucleon reactions has been extensively studied in recent experiments at electron / photon accelerator facilities  @xcite . among the motivations for such studies",
    "are to obtain a deeper understanding of the baryon resonances and to search for the so - called missing resonances , whose existence is predicted by quark models but has not been experimentally confirmed .",
    "most of the data from these experiments are for reactions of kaon photoproduction which are accompanied by the ground state of @xmath9 or @xmath10 hyperon , i.e. , @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "recently , there have been reports on experimental studies of other strangeness production processes that include @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath0 photoproduction  @xcite . although the reported cross sections for these reactions are smaller than those for @xmath15 and @xmath16 photoproduction , the suppression factor is not large .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the cross sections for these reactions in the resonance region , corresponding to total center - of - mass energies around @xmath4  gev , is as large as one half of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 photoproduction cross sections .",
    "this indicates that these reaction channels can not be neglected in a full coupled channel calculation for extracting the properties of these baryon resonances  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these reactions have their own interesting physics regarding the structure of hadrons .",
    "for example , photoproduction of @xmath17 and @xmath14 can be used to obtain information on the properties of strange scalar @xmath18 meson  @xcite .",
    "regarding the missing resonance problem , photoproduction of @xmath0 provides a useful tool for testing baryon models in the literature . according to the quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite , most nucleon and @xmath3 resonances have small couplings to the @xmath0 channel . some resonances , mostly missing or not - well - established ones , are , however , predicted to have large partial decay widths into this channel .",
    "for example , the missing resonance @xmath8 was predicted to have a decay width of @xmath19  mev .",
    "therefore , photoproduction of @xmath0 could be an ideal reaction in which one can search for such resonances .",
    "experimental studies of @xmath0 photoproduction are very rare , and only limited experimental data on the total cross section for @xmath20 with large error bars have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the clas collaboration at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility recently measured the cross section of this reaction at 23 different photon energies covering from the threshold up to @xmath21  gev  @xcite .",
    "more accurate data for the total and differential cross sections are expected to be reported soon  @xcite .",
