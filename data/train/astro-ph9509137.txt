    "giant 2 regions have a fundamental role as probes of elemental abundances in extragalactic environments .",
    "existing spectroscopic studies of extragalactic 2 regions tend to emphasize systems with subsolar metallicities , due in part to inherent interest in chemically unevolved systems , but also because of selection effects , since characteristic luminosities and emission - line equivalent widths for 2 regions tend to decrease with increasing source metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite 1988 ) .",
    "data for nebulae in relatively high - metallicity environments , such as the inner regions of giant galaxies , are becoming increasingly available , however , and additional theoretical work is necessary if we are to make use of this information for quantitative abundance analyses .",
    "the presence of abundant atomic coolants in enriched 2 regions will typically lead to a low equilibrium electron temperature , with a large fraction of the radiated energy emitted by the heavy elements through infrared ground - state fine structure transitions .",
    "the strengths of the comparatively energetic optical lines are very sensitive to the electron temperature , and hence to nebular parameters that affect temperature . at abundances above a few times solar",
    ", the fine - structure cooling is efficient enough that optical forbidden lines from simple , low - density 2 regions are expected to be unobservable ( e.g. , @xcite 1985 ) . to date , however , no 2 region emitting a pure balmer - line spectrum has been discovered , even in surveys of h@xmath3-selected 2 regions in environments for which metallicity @xmath4 z@xmath1 is expected ( @xcite 1993 ) .",
    "the lack of such objects implies that physical parameters in real nebulae are modified so that the electron temperature is high enough to produce significant optical forbidden - line emission .",
    "the effects of interstellar dust could conceivably underlie at least some of the enhancement of optical emission in high-@xmath2 2 regions .",
    "dust can act to modify the thermal structure of a nebula in several ways .",
    "the removal of atomic coolants from the gas phase via depletion will tend to increase the electron temperature , leading to measurable changes in the emitted spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite 1993 ) .",
    "grains may selectively absorb a fraction of the lyman continuum photons powering the nebula , resulting in modification to the ionizing spectral energy distribution seen by the gas and to the resultant heating ( e.g. , @xcite 1977 ; @xcite 1986 ; @xcite 1989 ) .",
    "grains will also participate directly in the thermal balance by contributing photoelectrons that heat the plasma , and by cooling through radiation of energy transferred in captures of electrons ( e.g. , @xcite 1986 ; @xcite 1991 ) .",
    "previous studies emphasizing nebulae at @xmath5 z@xmath1 have generally concluded that selective absorption of the ionizing continuum by dust has a relatively small effect on the emergent optical spectrum of diffuse 2 regions ( e.g. , @xcite 1986 ) .",
    "given the greater temperature sensitivity of optical lines at higher @xmath2 , we might expect the influence of dust to be more important in metal - rich nebulae ; this statement is especially true if the dust - to - gas ratio scales with @xmath2 .",
    "the observational consequences of grain heating and cooling within 2 regions over the entire span of metallicity have also received only limited attention in previous work .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we have undertaken photoionization calculations appropriate for giant extragalactic 2 regions in order to understand possible consequences of dust in chemically enriched nebulae .",
    "we find that dust and associated depletion can indeed produce nonnegligible perturbations in the optical spectrum of metal - rich 2 regions .",
    "the influence of dust in such objects provides a possible basis for explaining several unexpected empirical characteristics of 2 regions in high-@xmath2 environments , including the lack of pure balmer - line nebulae .",
    "if grains survive in the inner parts of spherical nebulae , they may selectively enhance emission in high - ionization lines .",
    "dust is unlikely to contribute large uncertainties in _ gas phase _ abundance estimates based on the oxygen emission lines , but ambiguities in depletion factors and density effects will contribute substantial uncertainty to `` empirical '' metallicity - excitation calibrations for @xmath0 z@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite 1979 ) .",
    "finally , we suggest possible revisions to theoretical relations between ion - weighted temperatures employed in relative abundance analyses , necessitated by a self - consistent treatment of the presence of dust in 2 regions .",
    "calculations appropriate for prediction of 2 region optical spectra were generated with the photoionization code cloudy , version 84.09 ( @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "parameters were chosen such that the results would illustrate the possible consequences of dust in giant , extragalactic 2 regions ( gehrs ) as a function of metallicity .",
    "the ionizing continuum was represented by @xcite ( 1979 ) stellar atmospheres corresponding to @xmath6 of 38,000 k and 45,000 k , with total ionizing luminosities ( photons s@xmath7 ) of log @xmath8(h ) @xmath9 and 51.2 , respectively .",
    "the cooler stellar continuum model is interpolated from theoretical calculations for @xmath10 35,000 k and 40,000 k , and both of the final continuum choices assume stellar log(@xmath11 ) = 4.5 . based on systematic trends in existing observations , the lower @xmath6 values",
    "are more applicable for nebulae with relatively high @xmath2 ( e.g. , mccall , rybski , & shields 1985 ; @xcite 1988 ) .",
    "the nebular geometry was assumed to be spherical , extending from an inner radius of 0.01 pc to the strmgren radius @xmath12 defined as the point where the ionized hydrogen fraction fell below 1% .",
    "a total hydrogen density of @xmath13 @xmath14 was adopted for material described by volume filling factors of @xmath15 and 0.0347 for the 38,000 k and 45,000 k cases , respectively .",
    "if we define ionization parameter @xmath16 in the customary way [ @xmath17(h)@xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 is the speed of light ] , these combinations of parameters yield log @xmath20 at @xmath21 z@xmath1 in the dust - free case ; estimates of @xmath16 for gehrs are comparable to or somewhat larger than this value ( @xcite 1990 and references therein ) .",
    "@xmath16 is a function of @xmath2 , due to the dependence of recombination rates and hence @xmath12 on electron temperature @xmath22 , as well as a function of dust content , since grains will absorb a portion of the ionizing radiation and also modify the @xmath22 structure of the nebula through heating and cooling processes .",
    "total elemental abundances for the case of @xmath21 z@xmath1 were taken from @xcite ( 1989 ) .",
    "for other values of @xmath2 , abundances of elements heavier than helium were assumed to be in solar proportions , with the exception of nitrogen , which was assumed to have a secondary component such that its abundance scales as @xmath23 .",
    "empirical evidence for a secondary contribution to n in gehrs is discussed , for example , in @xcite ( 1993 ) .",
    "depletion onto grains was assumed to modify gas - phase abundances by factors taken from @xcite ( 1986 , table 3 ) corresponding to an overall average for the interstellar medium ( ism ) . the resulting total and depleted abundances at @xmath21 z@xmath1",
    "are listed in table 1 .",
    "the grains themselves were assumed to consist of a graphite - silicate mix with a size distribution as described by @xcite ( 1977 ) for the diffuse ism , with optical constants as given by @xcite ( 1984 ) and extended within the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) bandpass by @xcite ( 1989 ) .",
    "the resulting dust opacity features a maximum at photon energies of @xmath24 ev and a decrease at higher energies , as required by the kramers - kronig relations for realistic grain materials ( e.g. , @xcite 1983 ; @xcite 1986 ) .",
    "scattering by grains is neglected in the present calculations . at ionizing energies ,",
    "the scattering phase function for the grains is expected to be predominantly forward - throwing . at optical wavelengths , scattering in and out of the line of sight",
    "will approximately cancel in a spherical geometry . in the current implementation of cloudy , reddening of the emergent spectrum by grain absorption is also neglected in the spherical case .",
    "our principal interest in the present study is the consequences of dust for the structural and thermal characteristics of nebulae , rather than on emission - line transfer effects of the dust .",
    "the effects of internal scattering and absorption have been discussed previously by @xcite ( 1970 , 1983 ) , @xcite ( 1980 ) , and @xcite ( 1989 ) , among others . for the cases of interest here ,",
    "the scattering and absorption optical depths within @xmath12 are relatively small (  [ extinct ] ) ; in such cases , dereddening of the observed optical spectrum based on the balmer line strengths is expected to reproduce the intrinsic line ratios with reasonable accuracy ( @xcite 1983 ) . as a result ,",
    "the predictions of line ratios presented here are suitable for direct comparison with dereddened ratios derived from observations .",
    "thermal effects of dust are quantified by extending the calculation of nebular ionization and energy equilibrium to include grains .",
    "additional details concerning the treatment of grain physics within cloudy can be found in @xcite ( 1991 , appendix c ) and @xcite ( 1994 ) .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio was assumed to scale in proportion with @xmath2 , with a normalization of 0.01 by mass at @xmath21 z@xmath1 .",
    "giant 2 regions exhibit supersonic line widths that correlate in amplitude with emission - line luminosity ( @xcite 1979 ) .",
    "line widths in excess of thermal values will modify the transfer of lines including infrared fine - structure transitions that would otherwise be optically thick in a quiescent nebula .",
    "the added velocity width facilitates the escape of these lines , and thus may decrease the equilibrium @xmath22 when the infrared transitions contribute a significant fraction of the total cooling ( e.g. , @xcite 1975 ) .",
    "we consequently assumed the presence of a microturbulent velocity component @xmath25 added in quadrature with the thermal @xmath26 ( @xmath27^{0.5}$ ] ) , with values of @xmath28 km s@xmath7 for the case of @xmath29 k and log @xmath8(h ) @xmath9 , and @xmath30 km s@xmath7 for @xmath31 k and log @xmath8(h ) @xmath32 .",
    "these choices of @xmath25 are derived from the empirical relation between recombination line luminosity and velocity width given by @xcite ( 1988 ) .",
    "the predicted strengths of optical forbidden lines , normalized to hydrogen recombination features , are plotted as a function of @xmath2 in figures 1 and 2 for @xmath29 k and 45,000 k , respectively .",
    "the curves show the expected behavior with increasing @xmath2 , with forbidden - line emission initially rising in response to the growing number of emitters , reaching a maximum , and declining at high @xmath2 as the total cooling efficiency increases and @xmath22 diminishes .",
    "the ratio of 2 @xmath333727/h@xmath34 exhibits an additional reversal , with increasing values at very high @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior stems from photoionization of o@xmath35 into excited states of o@xmath36 that can subsequently decay radiatively .",
    "the resulting emission component consequently scales directly with the abundance of o and hence with @xmath2 .",
    "while such emission can be important in some contexts ( e.g. , novae ; @xcite 1981 ) , it is unlikely to be significant in 2 regions , for which 2/h@xmath34 @xmath37 observationally ( e.g. , @xcite 1993 ) .",
    "the separate curves in a given plot in figures 1 and 2 illustrate the change in emission line behavior as the effects of dust are added incrementally .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to dust - free , undepleted nebulosity , while the other curves show the results of introducing depletion , dust opacity , and grain heating @xmath38 cooling . in almost all cases ,",
    "the effects of dust lead to an enhancement of optical forbidden - line emission over the undepleted , dust - free case , due to an increase in equilibrium @xmath22 .    for most of the lines , the largest shift in the plotted line ratio curves results when depletion is introduced .",
    "this pattern implies that depletion of gas - phase coolants is likely to be the most important aspect of dust in terms of its influence on the observed spectrum ( see also @xcite 1986 ) ; this statement is supported by comparisons of how forbidden line strengths change when the three effects of dust are added in isolation , rather than in succession . while depletion of optically emitting elements can produce a reduction of line emission at low @xmath2 ,",
    "the result is more typically an increase in optical line emission as the cooling efficiency of other transitions decreases and equilibrium @xmath22 increases .",
    "infrared fine - structure transitions are particularly important for establishing this behavior , since they scale in strength with abundance but are relatively insensitive to @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite ( 1993 ) has emphasized the importance of the [ si ] 34.8 @xmath39 m line and infrared [ fe ] transitions for cooling in an undepleted nebula ; in real nebulae , these elements are likely to be subject to significant depletion onto grains , producing an increase in @xmath22 that can boost the strength of optical lines",
    ".    selective absorption of ionizing radiation by dust additionally modifies the ionization and thermal structure of a nebula , leading to changes in its optical spectrum . the decrease in grain opacity at photon energies above the lyman limit results in a hardening of the ionizing radiation field as it is attenuated by grains .",
    "the resultant boost in average photon energy produces greater heating per ionization , with a corresponding increase in @xmath22 and optical line emission .",
    "the amplitude of this effect in gehrs is likely to be small , based on the results in figures 1 and 2 as well as analytic arguments .",
    "the optical depth of dust will scale with the total column density of gas within the strmgren radius , @xmath40 , and the dust - to - gas ratio , assumed here to scale with @xmath2 . from the definition of @xmath16",
    ", we can express @xmath41 where the case b hydrogen recombination coefficient @xmath42 for @xmath43 k ( approximately correct for @xmath21 z@xmath1 ) and @xmath44 @xmath14 is taken from @xcite ( 1987 ) . for a dust - to - gas ratio representative of the galactic ism , the maximum euv absorption optical depth will occur at approximately 17 ev , with @xmath45 ( @xcite 1989 ) . for a strmgren sphere , the maximum euv optical depth with",
    "thus be @xmath46 where @xmath16 is defined in the dust - free limit .",
    "the expected @xmath47 in gehrs is thus significant for typical parameters , and will be higher if the nebulae are relatively dusty and/or @xmath16 is elevated above typical values .",
    "substantial modification of the ionizing spectral energy distribution is more likely in galactic ultracompact and blister 2 regions ( e.g. , @xcite 1989 ) , which may be described by @xmath16 values much greater than those typical of gehrs . when dust opacity is large , @xmath12 and @xmath47 are obviously coupled further by the diminution of ionizing flux seen by atomic material , a point considered in more detail in  [ extinct ] .",
    "figures 1 and 2 also demonstrate that grain heating boosts the predicted optical emission even further .",
    "photoelectrons emitted by grains are expected to be more energetic and hence produce greater heating than photoelectrons emitted by the constituent atoms in isolation , because the ionization potential , or work function , is reduced for matter in a solid phase ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the treatment of grains employed by cloudy assumes a minimum work function of 8 ev for a neutral grain , with an increase in threshold energy as the grain becomes more strongly depleted of electrons and charged .",
    "the heating rate scales directly with the density of grains and , for a weak grain potential , the flux of radiation above the threshold energy . in a dust - free nebula",
    ", heating tends to be dominated by photoelectrons from recombined hydrogen and hence scales as @xmath48 .",
    "for an 2 region with fixed density and dust - to - gas ratio , the significance of grain heating relative to hydrogen bound - free heating consequently scales with the flux @xmath49 of energetic radiation ( or more generally , with ionization parameter @xmath16 , defined locally as a ratio of ionizing photon to electron densities ) .",
    "the relative dependence of grain heating on @xmath49 introduces a radial variation in the resulting thermal effects for a spherical nebula , with greater heating occurring at small radii ( see  [ tempgrads ] ) .",
    "grain cooling by electron attachment is also likely to be significant , and the relative importance of heating and cooling by grains is a more complicated function of the ionizing spectral energy distribution , grain potential , and @xmath22 ( @xcite 1991 , appendix c.14 ) .",
    "these initial results suggest that the collective effects of dust may indeed account for the absence of observed pure balmer - line nebulae .",
    "while 3 emission may become unobservable in low excitation gehrs , 2 emission is invariably detected , as noted previously , with 2 @xmath333727/h@xmath34 @xmath37 .",
    "this minimum is consistent in the present calculations with @xmath2 as high as @xmath50 z@xmath1 .",
    "observed strengths of 2 and 2 are similarly consistent in general terms with metallicities as high as this bound .",
    "the calculations presented here make a number of assumptions of uncertain validity for gehrs .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in this discussion is the detailed nature of grains in these nebulae . from studies of the galactic ism",
    ", it is well established that depletion rates are a function of environment ( @xcite 1986 and references therein ) .",
    "given the substantial output of radiative and kinetic energy by young stars , grains located near these sources might be expected to be modified and/or partially destroyed .",
    "@xcite ( 1974 ) presented a comparison of infrared emission from galactic and extragalactic 2 regions that has been interpreted as evidence for grain destruction in the gehrs .",
    "galactic sources exhibit a correlation between thermal radio continuum emission and infrared luminosity that @xcite employed to predict infrared fluxes from a group of more luminous gehrs , using h@xmath34 emission in place of radio continuum emission to trace @xmath8(h ) .",
    "observed @xmath51 @xmath39 m fluxes for the extragalactic sources fall short of the predicted fluxes derived in this manner .",
    "@xcite discussed several possible explanations for this discrepancy , including a deficiency of dust in the luminous extragalactic sources .",
    "the difference noted by @xcite between measured ir fluxes and the extrapolated predictions may be a manifestation of a more general pattern of disparity between high- and low - luminosity sources . as discussed by @xcite ( 1979 ) and @xcite ( 1984 ) ,",
    "2 regions show systematic trends with luminosity such that lower luminosity sources are denser and more centrally concentrated than their giant counterparts .",
    "both tendencies might be expected to result in higher @xmath16 for the galactic sources , and consequently greater heating of dust grains and resultant ir emission , consistent with the observational trend found by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , studies of the galactic ism demonstrate that depletion and hence the dust - to - gas ratio correlate with density ( @xcite 1990 ) , which would be consistent with a higher grain content in dense galactic 2 regions when compared with more diffuse gehrs .",
    "recent clues to the grain content of gehrs are provided by analyses of silicon and iron abundances in 2 regions and compact blue galaxies by @xcite ( 1995 ) and thuan ( 1995 , private communication ) . in both studies",
    "the results suggest that the depletion rates of these elements are lower in gehrs than in the average ism .",
    "these findings support a picture in which a fraction of the grains in nebulae are destroyed , such that the dust - to - gas ratio in gehrs is reduced somewhat from a simple extrapolation based on the galactic ism .",
    "if these results are characteristic of gehrs , the nebular predictions described here will exaggerate to some degree the actual effects of dust in these sources .",
    "the present calculations also assume a specific grain size distribution , which is again known to be a function of environment .",
    "the euv grain opacity and rate of grain heating are very sensitive to the small grain component ; if the small grain population is reduced compared to the ism average , as inferred in the orion nebula and other dense environs ( @xcite 1990 and references therein ) , the effects of dust opacity and heating will be correspondingly diminished .",
    "if 30 doradus can be regarded as representative of gehrs , however , the small grain component may actually be _ enhanced _ relative to grains in the galactic ism ( fitzpatrick 1986 ) .",
    "the elemental content of dust in gehrs is a further major uncertainty .",
    "the relative depletion rates are poorly constrained , and more generally , the _ total _ relative abundances may differ from a simple scaling of solar proportions . in light of these many fundamental ambiguities ,",
    "the present calculations can only be considered illustrative of the effects of dust in 2 regions , rather than providing definitive predictions .",
    "one means of assessing whether the nebular calculations described here bear any applicability to real gehrs is by comparison of predicted and observed line ratios for these systems .",
    "figure 3 shows line ratio plots selected for ease of comparison with those given in figure 8 of the extensive study of gehrs by @xcite ( 1985 ) ; the plotted points represent observational measurements from @xcite .",
    "the plotted curves show the prediction results for a dust - free nebula ( solid curves ) and for a depleted nebula with full grain physics ( dotted curves ) , as a function of changing @xmath2 , for the two choices of @xmath6 .",
    "the behavior of the oxygen lines suggests that a higher @xmath6 is required at lower @xmath2 , in agreement with previous work ( e.g. , @xcite 1985 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that in the high metallicity regime ( @xmath52 ) , the calculations for the undepleted nebula tend to underpredict emission in 2 and 2 , while the flux in these lines is excessive in the calculations with grains .",
    "this pattern is more readily seen in figure 4 , which plots 3/h@xmath34 as a function of 2/h@xmath3 and 2/h@xmath3 for the same data sets . a simple explanation for this behavior might be that the assumed grain component is excessive , and the actual depletion and grain effects are somewhat reduced .",
    "other explanations are possible , however .",
    "the strength of 2 emission is particularly sensitive to the value of @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite 1989 ) , and additional calculations indicate that the predicted 2/h@xmath3 ratio for the dusty nebula can be brought into agreement with the observations by increasing @xmath16 by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "this remedy is less successful for the 2 line strength , however , and fine - tuning of other parameters such as n abundance is likely to be necessary to bring predictions for 2 into agreement with the observations . decreasing @xmath16 in the dust - free case",
    "does not significantly increase 2 , and leads to substantial decreases in the strength of the other optical forbidden lines considered here .",
    "the predictions in figure 4 permit an interesting comparison with similar plots in figures 7 and 8 of kennicutt , keel , & blaha ( 1989 ) for observations of 2 regions in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "@xcite ( 1989 ) noted that the nuclear sources show a systematic trend of greater 2 and 2 line strength at a given value of 3/h@xmath34 than is seen in extranuclear gehrs .",
    "their observational results for the nuclear sources are , in fact , in relatively good agreement with the predictions for dusty nebulae presented here , for @xmath2 up to @xmath54z@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the trend in the nuclear 2 regions might stem from the presence of weak active nuclei that are spatially unresolved from normal circumnuclear star - forming regions .",
    "the present results suggest a possible alternative explanation whereby the enhanced 2 and 2 emission results from an elevated dust content in nuclear nebulae relative to disk 2 regions",
    ". the nucleus corresponds to the center of a galaxy s potential well , and the interstellar pressure in such an environment is expected to exceed typical disk ism pressures by up to 2 orders of magnitude or more ( e.g. , @xcite 1992 ; @xcite 1993 ) . resulting enhancements in density may foster enhanced grain formation and growth , consistent with local correlations between density and depletion , thus providing a physical motivation for why nuclear nebulae could be unusually dusty .",
    "if grains are important in modifying the overall behavior of an 2 region , we might expect this fact to be signaled observationally by signatures of reddening or extinction .",
    "the extinction optical depth produced by dust associated with the 2 scales as in equation 2 , but with optical depth at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) reduced by a factor of @xmath57 from @xmath47 ( @xcite 1989 ) , such that @xmath56 will be only a few tenths as the dust column becomes optically thick at ionizing energies .",
    "if the dust optical depth is increased beyond this level , the fact that the grain euv and optical opacities are coupled implies an additional feedback mechanism that will limit optical indications of extinction .",
    "significant @xmath47 reduces @xmath58 ; but achieving a large @xmath47 requires a substantial @xmath58 for typical dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "large euv opacity and hence significant @xmath56 will thus result only from extreme nebular conditions .",
    "for example , if internal dust is sufficient to produce @xmath59 and hence @xmath60 , then @xmath58 ( which is proportional to @xmath61^{1/3}$ ] in the dust - free case ) must be @xmath62 for @xmath21 z@xmath1 ( cf .",
    "@xmath63 seen by the gas will be reduced as @xmath47 increases and a growing fraction of the ionizing radiation is absorbed by grains ; @xmath64 will result in a reduction of the nebular radius by a factor of @xmath54 relative to the dust - free @xmath12 , with @xmath65% of the ionizing photons absorbed by dust for a standard dust - to - gas ratio ( @xcite 1972 ; see also @xcite 1971 and @xcite 1989 ) . in order to obtain the @xmath58 producing @xmath59 , the product @xmath61^{1/3}$ ] and",
    "hence @xmath16 corresponding to the dust - free case must be increased by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "conditions in which dust",
    "so strongly modifies the nebula are probably only present in systems that are clearly distinct from classical gehrs .",
    "one such class of objects is that of ultracompact 2 regions ( e.g. , @xcite 1989 ) , which are far denser than typical gehrs and show observational evidence for substantial dust absorption of ionizing radiation .",
    "similar conditions may also obtain in the dense central regions of starburst galaxies .",
    "the high @xmath66 and large @xmath16 that describe these environments are inconsistent with optical line ratios for gehrs .",
    "substantial extinction may still be present with less dramatic effects on the nebula if the ionization is produced by distributed sources rather than a central compact star cluster .",
    "an idealized picture illustrating this point would be a collection of strmgren spheres aligned along the line of sight ; @xmath56 through a single sphere may be small , but the collective effect of multiple foreground systems could produce significant extinction of emission produced in the more distant spheres .",
    "observations suggest , however , that internal optical extinction in gehrs is indeed fairly small .",
    "studies of the stellar population in 30 doradus ( @xcite 1994 ) and in ngc  3603 ( @xcite 1994 ) , for example , demonstrate that the massive stellar component that dominates production of ionizing radiation is relatively concentrated , suggesting that idealization of the nebula as a single strmgren sphere is unlikely to be grossly in error .",
    "empirical estimates of @xmath67 for gehrs are also rarely more than @xmath68 ( @xcite 1984 ) .",
    "while extinction values based on reddening of the balmer lines alone may underestimate the total extinction , due to surface effects ( @xcite 1970 ) , radio measurements of gehrs suggest that the optical estimates of total @xmath67 are not in error by large factors ( @xcite 1980 ; @xcite 1986 ; @xcite 1988 ; see also discussion in @xcite 1990 ) .",
    "although the total optical extinction in gehrs is thus only modest , the effect of dust on the nebula can still be significant if euv opacity is much larger than opacity at optical wavelengths .",
    "it also must be remembered that attenuation of the _ ionizing _ radiation field is not directly traced by the comparison between balmer line and radio fluxes .",
    "existing abundance analyses of 2 regions have relied heavily on the @xmath69 parameter [ @xmath70 ( 2 @xmath333727 @xmath38 3 @xmath71)/h@xmath34 ] as an indicator of the abundance of oxygen , which in turn is often taken as a proxy for the total metallicity ( @xcite 1979 ) .",
    "this approach can be justified by the dominant role of oxygen as a coolant in typical nebulae ; the calibration of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath2 is nonetheless dependent at some level on the abundances of other coolants , however .",
    "an important question is thus whether this calibration is significantly modified by the presence of grains and associated depletion .",
    "another way of expressing this question is to ask whether the gas - phase oxygen abundance derived from @xmath69 can be translated into a total oxygen abundance ( or @xmath2 ) through simply scaling by the oxygen depletion factor .    to illustrate the effects of dust on the use of @xmath69 as an abundance indicator , figure 5 displays @xmath69 as a function of oxygen abundance _ in the gas phase _",
    ", for the calculations described in  [ calculations ] . by comparing the curves for a given @xmath6 that correspond to no dust and full dust effects , we can see that relatively small changes in @xmath69 result from the presence of grains and associated depletion at low @xmath2 .",
    "the shift in predicted @xmath69 due to grains at a given gas - phase abundance increases significantly at higher @xmath2 ; at the same time , however , @xmath69 is becoming a steeper function of @xmath2 , such that a large shift in predicted @xmath69 propagates into a small difference in @xmath2 . in terms of the observationally relevant comparison , for a measured value of @xmath69 ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2 due to dust effects is likely to be @xmath73 dex for a gas - phase oxygen abundance of up to @xmath74 times the solar value .",
    "we conclude that the effects of grains are unlikely to introduce large errors in measurements of gas - phase oxygen abundance based on @xmath69 .",
    "this conclusion differs somewhat from that of @xcite ( 1993 ) .",
    "the calibration of @xmath69 at high @xmath2 is rather sensitive to @xmath66 , however , due to suppression of fine - structure cooling ( @xcite 1993 ) , as well as @xmath16 , and the cumulative effects of these uncertainties cast doubt on whether a reliable calibration of @xmath69 versus @xmath2 is possible at @xmath75 z@xmath1 ( see also @xcite 1986 ) .",
    "temperature gradients in dust - free 2 regions are determined by the efficiency of cooling mechanisms and the average heating per ionization as a function of radius . at very low @xmath2 ,",
    "collisionally excited hydrogen ly@xmath3 plays an important role in cooling .",
    "the neutral fraction of hydrogen that can give rise to such emission increases monotonically with radius , so that the cooling efficiency increases with @xmath76 , and @xmath22 tends to be a decreasing function of radius . at",
    "higher @xmath2 , collisionally excited lines of heavy elements become important for cooling , with infrared transitions playing an increasing role ; important ions with ground - state fine structure giving rise to infrared emission include doubly ionized o , s , and n , which boosts the cooling efficiency in the inner nebula where these species are abundantm , [ siii ] 18.7 and 33.5 @xmath39 m , and [ niii ] 57.3 @xmath39 m . ] ( @xcite 1980 ) .",
    "in addition , the frequency dependence of hydrogen and helium bound - free opacity guarantees that the average energy and resultant heating per ionizing photon increases with increasing radius .",
    "the combined effects are expected to produce a gradient @xmath77 in high metallicity 2 regions the gradient in heating stemming from bound - free opacity is overwhelmed by the role of ly@xmath3 cooling in determining the equilibrium @xmath22 , which consequently decreases with @xmath76 . ] .",
    "infrared transitions also play an important role in cooling the lower - ionization , outer portions of a nebula , particularly by emission of [ siii ] 34.8 @xmath39 m , lines of [ feii ] ( e.g. , see @xcite 1988 ) , and [ cii ] 158 @xmath39 m .    grains and associated depletion may have an important role in modifying the thermal structure of gehrs beyond a simple global increase in @xmath22 , when compared with the dust - free case",
    ". examination of the elemental depletion factors given in table 1 indicates that depletion has a much stronger influence on elements dominating fine - structure cooling in the low - ionization , outer portions of a nebula ( si , fe , c ) than on those important in the inner nebula ( o , s , n ) .",
    "depletion will consequently tend to steepen temperature gradients from the undepleted case , by preferentially elevating the temperature of the outer nebula .",
    "this steepening will be mitigated , however , through heating of the inner nebula by grains formed from the depleted elements . as noted in  [ general ] , the rate of grain heating will tend to scale locally with the flux of ionizing radiation . radial dilution and attenuation of the radiation produced by a central star or stars",
    "will thus lead to a radial falloff in grain heating within a nebula , assuming a uniform distribution of dust .",
    "these consequences can be seen quantitatively in the middle panels of figures 6 and 7 , which show @xmath22 profiles for the calculations described in  [ calculations ] , for the case of @xmath21 z@xmath1 .",
    "the results of adding the effects of dust incrementally are illustrated by the successive curves .",
    "for comparison , the lower panels show the characteristic ionization state of the gas as a function of radius , as described by the ionization fraction of o@xmath36 and o@xmath78 .",
    "grain heating and cooling as a function of @xmath76 is illustrated in the top panels .",
    "grain heating may exceed 70% of the total heating rate in the inner nebula , and decreases monotonically with increasing radius through most of the 2 region .",
    "near @xmath12 , the fractional heating may again become large ; in this partially ionized zone , hydrogen bound - free heating is rapidly diminishing , but photons with energy @xmath79 ev continue to produce significant grain photoelectrons .",
    "fractional cooling by dust is lower than fractional heating at all radii , with the possible exception of the outermost portions of the strmgren sphere .",
    "these results show a general similarity to calculations with a blister geometry described by @xcite ( 1991 ) .",
    "the radial dependences of depletion and grain heating propagate into the predicted fluxes of optical lines , as can be seen by a review of figures 1 and 2 . for both choices of @xmath6 ,",
    "emission in 2 , 2 , and 2 ( which represent relatively weakly ionized species ) show a strong response to depletion , while the response in 3 is less dramatic . in contrast , 3 shows a much greater sensitivity to grain heating than do 2 , 2 , or 2 , for the nebula powered by the cooler star .",
    "the differences in the behavior of 3 between the two choices of @xmath6 reflect the relative extent of the o@xmath78 zone ( cf . figs . 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the cooler star produces a more concentrated region of o@xmath78 , which is consequently more strongly affected by grain heating ; the o@xmath78 zone produced by the hotter star overlaps more broadly with zones of low - ionization species , introducing a greater sensitivity to depletion .",
    "grain heating might be expected to produce very strong enhancements of high - ionization lines that form close to the ionizing stars . in the present calculations , however , an easily observable signature of this effect is not predicted , because such lines are relatively weak , even when dust heating is taken into account .",
    "a tradeoff results in that a strong dust signature may be more apparent when @xmath6 is relatively low , due to the fact that the emitting volume of a high - ionization species is then highly concentrated to the region of strong heating by grains ; but when this volume is small , emission is likely to be weak except for a tracer with high abundance , such as oxygen .",
    "an illustration is provided in the case of @xmath29 k by 3 @xmath333869/h@xmath34 , which increases by a factor of @xmath80 at @xmath21 z@xmath1 and by an order of magnitude at @xmath81z@xmath1 when grain heating and cooling is introduced to the calculation ; but invariably the 3 line flux is less than 1% of that of h@xmath34 . if @xmath6 is as high as 45,000 k , the 3 line becomes more readily observable ( 3/h@xmath82 ) , but shows only a weak sensitivity to dust thermal effects since the ne@xmath78 volume extends over a larger fraction of the nebula , including regions where grain photoelectric heating is relatively unimportant .",
    "signatures of radially dependent grain heating may be more readily detected in planetary nebulae , which can span a broader range of ionization than is typically found in 2 regions .",
    "@xcite ( 1990 ) performed a detailed analysis of the spectrum of the planetary nebula ngc  7027 , and noted a persistent difficulty in accounting for the observed ( strong ) emission in 5 @xmath833346 , 3426 after adjusting model nebular parameters so as to reproduce correctly the strength of heii lines .",
    "since the heii features are recombination lines while 5 is collisionally excited , the unexpected strength of the latter emission might be explained by a thermal mechanism such as grain heating in the inner nebula , if a fraction of the dust survives in this environment .",
    "test calculations with model parameters similar to those employed by keyes et al .",
    "are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "detailed study of other sources is needed in order to ascertain whether grain heating is often an important influence on the emergent spectrum of planetary nebulae .",
    "abundance analyses based on 2 region spectra are potentially sensitive to the details of nebular temperature gradients .",
    "the derivation of an ionic abundance from a collisionally excited emission line requires the use of a @xmath22 value appropriate to that ion .",
    "nonuniform temperature structure necessitates the use of different characteristic temperatures for different ions ; in addition , temperature - sensitive ( auroral / nebular ) line ratios of a single ion can differ from ion - weighted temperatures that are physically appropriate for extracting abundance information from line strengths .",
    "radial gradients are a specific case of temperature fluctuations that contribute lingering uncertainty in the calibration of abundances based on nebular studies ( e.g. , @xcite 1967 ; @xcite 1993 )",
    ". detailed aspects of these problems have been reviewed by @xcite ( 1992 ) , who derived theoretical relations between ion - weighted temperatures for various species , as well as between line - ratio and ion - weighted temperatures .",
    "garnett s models do not include the consequences of grains , although he notes their possible significance for perturbing nebular temperature structure .",
    "the behavior of ion - weighted temperatures in the present calculations suggest some possible modifications to previous theoretical work .",
    "garnett s models included depletion of si ( which he excluded completely ) and fe , and our calculations with only depletion are consistent with his results . in the preceding discussion , it was noted that depletion selectively boosts @xmath22 in the outer nebula , while grain heating is most important in the inner nebula . as a result ,",
    "models that include depletion but neglect the thermal effects of the corresponding grain population may overestimate the steepness of the temperature gradient in an enriched nebula .",
    "these expectations are borne out in part in the present calculations , as can be seen by examination of figures 8 and 9 , which plot the ion - weighted temperatures @xmath84 and @xmath85 as functions of @xmath86 .",
    "these temperatures are calculated according to equation ( 1 ) in @xcite ( 1992 ) ; the plotted points span @xmath87 z@xmath1 . also shown in these figures",
    "are the trends found by garnett ( and confirmed by us ) for a nebula with depletion alone , i.e. , his equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , as well as diagonal lines of uniform @xmath22 .    at high @xmath2 , the calculations with depletion and grain effects show a more nearly isothermal behavior than predictions restricted to depletion , for the case of the cooler @xmath6 . for comparison ,",
    "the predictions for a dust - free and undepleted nebula are also shown ; interestingly , these predictions are in better agreement with the calculations with full dust effects than with those taking only depletion into account .",
    "this behavior reflects a rough tendency for depletion and grain heating to balance each other in terms of their net effect on @xmath88 .",
    "for the hotter @xmath6 , @xmath85 at a given @xmath86 for the dusty nebula is still somewhat overpredicted by the relation with depletion only , while @xmath89 versus @xmath86 is consistent with the depletion - only results . for @xmath31",
    "k , s@xmath78 occupies an intermediate zone in radius that experiences a smaller relative increase in @xmath22 than either of the inner or outer regions weighted respectively by o@xmath78 or o@xmath36 ; the overall gradient in @xmath22 remains positive for the most part , however , such that the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath84 does not change appreciably from the dust - free or depletion - only case .",
    "calculations with @xmath66 increased to 100 and 1000 @xmath14 produce a general increase in nebular temperatures , due to partial collisional suppression of fine - structure cooling , but the ion - weighted temperature behavior is qualitatively the same as seen in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "these results also generally show a weak sensitivity to @xmath16 . increasing @xmath90",
    "such that log @xmath91 causes the _ dust - free _",
    "calculations for @xmath29 k to approach garnett s relations , since the inner zone of high - ionization that cools efficiently expands , resulting in a steeper @xmath22 gradient ; the results for the dusty nebula are qualitatively unchanged , however .",
    "we find reasonable agreement in the present calculations with relations listed by @xcite for other ion - weighted temperatures [ i.e. , @xmath92 ; @xmath93 ; @xmath94 ; @xmath95 ; @xmath96 .",
    "if enriched gehrs contain significant quantities of dust , the present results suggest that these nebulae may be treated as isothermal systems in terms of the relative behavior of ion - weighted temperatures , to good approximation .",
    "while this statement is strictly true only for the calculations presented here with the cooler @xmath6 , empirical evidence suggests that the characteristic @xmath6 of a nebula decreases with increasing metallicity , such that a relatively soft radiation field is , in fact , appropriate for enriched systems with @xmath97 k. if dust is efficiently destroyed in 2 regions , an isothermal treatment may still be appropriate , since the effects of depletion as well as grain heating would be vitiated is too large ; see , for example , discussion in @xcite 1977 ; @xcite 1985 ; @xcite 1995 ) , which suggests that our results are conservative in that we are unlikely to predict a ( positive ) @xmath88 that is too shallow . ] .",
    "we note that nebular models with depletion alone may nonetheless produce accurate predictions if grains are preferentially destroyed at small radii .",
    "in this situation the effects of grain heating that predominate at small @xmath76 would be removed , while depletion effects that selectively influence the outer nebula would still be relevant .",
    "evidence for reduced depletion in the inner , high - ionization regions of planetary nebulae has been discussed recently by @xcite ( 1995 ) .",
    "modifications to relations between line - ratio - inferred @xmath22 and ion - weighted temperatures will also result from dust effects . in the present calculations the largest discrepancies between the two temperature values occur at ion - weighted values of @xmath98 k",
    "; in this domain , auroral transitions employed for direct estimation of @xmath22 are generally too weak to be observable .",
    "additional perturbations in temperature estimates from line ratios ( and also ion - weighted @xmath22 values ) may result from more complicated spatial distributions of dust , as noted by peimbert et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    as a final cautionary note , we remind the reader that the present calculations ( and many others in the literature ) assume a constant density , independent of @xmath76 . while a detailed inquiry into the effects of nonuniform density is beyond the scope of the present work , line fluxes and temperature structure can certainly deviate in important ways from the predictions given here if large gradients in density exist within a nebula .",
    "observations suggest that @xmath66 is often a decreasing function of @xmath76 in gehrs ( e.g. , @xcite 1984 ) . for 2 regions with gradients of this form",
    ", the temperature of the inner nebula may be boosted and positive gradients in @xmath22 again diminished if @xmath66 at small radii is sufficient to partially suppress cooling via infrared fine - structure transitions with low critical densities . in general terms , however , the physical effects of the generic grains discussed in this paper are independent of the density structure of the nebula in which the dust resides .",
    "embedded dust can modify the optical spectrum of gehrs , through a combination of effects that mostly act to increase @xmath22 .",
    "the largest perturbations are generally the result of depletion of coolants from the gas phase , although grain opacity and heating may be significant in some cases .",
    "the net result is usually an increase in optical forbidden - line strengths , particularly at high metallicity .",
    "dust may lead to nonnegligible modification of nebular behavior without introducing strong signatures of reddening or extinction .",
    "the influence of grains provides a simple way of explaining the observational lack of 2 regions emitting a pure balmer - line spectrum at optical wavelengths , which is expected on theoretical grounds for dust - free nebulae with metallicity only slightly greater than z@xmath1 . at high @xmath2 ,",
    "predicted enhancements of 2 and 2 in particular show a resemblance to the empirical behavior of 2 regions in galaxy nuclei .",
    "if these environments are particularly dusty , due perhaps to characteristically elevated densities , the influence of dust provides an alternative mechanism to weak active nuclei for explaining the anomalous line ratios of these sources .",
    "depletion and heating by photoelectrons emitted by grains in 2 regions may introduce significant modifications to nebular temperature structure .",
    "depletion selectively influences elements that are important for cooling the outer portions of nebulae , while grain heating is most effective at small radii .",
    "modifications to temperature gradients within gehrs by dust may necessitate changes in assumptions employed in nebular abundance analyses , specifically in the relationships between ion - weighted temperatures for different species . for chemically enriched gehrs",
    ", the present results suggest that these nebulae can be treated as nearly isothermal systems .",
    "inclusion of grain physics is unlikely to result in large changes of gas - phase heavy - element abundances derived for low-@xmath2 objects and gehrs ionized by relatively hot stars . in general , dust - related phenomena",
    "will contribute an uncertainty of @xmath99 dex or less in gas - phase oxygen abundances derived from the @xmath69 parameter .",
    "modifications to nebular temperature structure by dust and associated depletion may be significant in 2 regions described by high @xmath2 and low @xmath100 , and should be considered when deriving relative abundances for heavy elements .",
