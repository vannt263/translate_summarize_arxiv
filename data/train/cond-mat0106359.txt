    "over the last decade , rna has transformed itself from being a relatively minor player in the central dogma of watson and crick to being one of the central players in molecular biology .",
    "indeed , it has been recently demonstrated that in addition to its `` information carrier '' role in protein synthesis , some types of rna s , known as ribozymes , have an enzymatic activity which is crucial to the functioning of the cell @xcite . as a consequence of this new prominent role of rna , the search for the three dimensional structure of rna has become an important problem in biology .",
    "this view was expressed forcefully by tinoco and bustamante@xcite .    as this paper is addressed to theoretical physicists ,",
    "we begin with a schematic review .",
    "a very thorough review on rna folding can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "rna is a heteropolymer constructed out of a four - letter alphabet , @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( for the four bases or nucleotides cytosine , guanine , adenine , and uracil ) .",
    "the length of an rna chain ranges typically from 76 for trna to a few thousand base pairs for mrna . in solution",
    ", there is an attraction between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and between @xmath9 and @xmath10 with energies @xmath11 kcal / mole and @xmath12 kcal / mole respectively .",
    "there is also a weaker attraction between @xmath8 and @xmath6 , with energy @xmath13 kcal / mole .",
    "note the correspondence 300 k @xmath14 0.6 kcal /mole",
    "@xmath14 1/40 ev .    consider an rna sequence @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 takes on one of the four possible values @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath17 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "for example , we might be given the sequence @xmath18 .",
    "the attraction between the nucleotides folds the rna heteropolymer into a @xmath19dimensional structure referred to as a shape .",
    "biological functions depend largely on the shape assumed by a particular rna .",
    "thus , the map from sequence space to shape space is of great importance in molecular biology and has been much discussed in the biophysical literature . as mentioned above , this has been even more true since the discovery of the enzymatic activity of some rna .    in the molecular biology of biopolymers , it is conventional to define three levels of structures .",
    "the primary structure is just the chemical sequence , or sequence of nucleotides .",
    "the secondary structure is the local short - range pairing of complementary bases , leading to segments of helices separated by loops and bulges ( `` clover - leaf '' structure ) . finally , the tertiary structure is the spatial arrangement of these secondary motifs , in which the loops and bulges themselves can partially pair , leading to the so - called pseudo - knots ( see fig .",
    "= 0.5    fig .  1a : secondary ( left ) and tertiary ( right ) structure of a trna.(from i. tinoco , with permission . )",
    "an example of pseudo knot is the `` kissing hairpin '' fig .",
    "= 0.3    fig .",
    "1b : a `` kissing hairpin '' .",
    "in contrast to the problem of protein folding @xcite , rna folding is hierarchical in that its secondary structure is much more stable than its tertiary structure , which can be treated as a perturbation@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the two levels of folding ( secondary and tertiary ) can be separated by varying the concentration of mg@xmath20 ions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the attractive force between nucleotides saturates .",
    "once a given nucleotide @xmath7 has paired with a nucleotide @xmath4 it can not be paired with yet another @xmath21 in contrast , the attraction between amino acids do not saturate .",
    "thus , the problem of rna folding is considerably simpler than the problem of protein folding .",
    "the determination of secondary structure has reached a very high level of sophistication based on dynamic programming algorithms @xcite .",
    "the problem of rna folding is clearly topological in flavor and is thus not easily amenable to dynamic programming methods , although some algorithm has been proposed recently@xcite . on the other hand , we know from the field theoretic literature that topological considerations also play an important role in such subjects as matrix theory or @xmath22theory . in this paper",
    ", we propose that matrix theory may be useful to the problem of rna folding .",
    "we develop a matrix theoretic representation of the topological aspect of rna folding .    in section",
    "i , we formulate the rna folding problem more precisely . in section",
    "ii , we show how it can be formulated as an @xmath0 matrix field theory . in section iii , we show that the @xmath23 dependence of the field theory can be made explicit in the functional integral formulation of the problem . as a result ,",
    "the natural way to compute the @xmath24 expansion is through a steepest descent method which is described in section iv .",
    "as this expansion is very complicated to perform at higher order , we resort in section v to recursion relations which allow us to approximately incorporate the higher order powers in @xmath24 .    for a simple introduction to this work",
    ", one can go for instance to the website http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/infobio01/zee/",
    "given an rna sequence @xmath15 of @xmath25 bases , let us write down the partition function @xmath26 at temperature @xmath27 .",
    "we will proceed in steps .",
    "first , construct the matrix @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the @xmath30 by @xmath30 real symmetric matrix giving the attractive energy between nucleotides , @xmath31 etc .",
    "we set the diagonal elements @xmath32 to @xmath33 to indicate the fact that a nucleotide does not attract itself . the heaviside function",
    "@xmath34 incorporates the fact that the rna molecule is not infinitely flexible and we can not pair nucleotides separated by less than 4 sites .",
    "the attractive potential can be taken to be @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the strength and range of the attraction respectively .",
    "now construct    @xmath38    where @xmath39 denotes all pairs with @xmath40 , @xmath41 all quadruplets with @xmath42 and so on .",
    "then the partition function is given by @xmath43 the function @xmath44 can be taken to be , for example , @xmath45 for a model in which the nucleotides are connected along the rna heteropolymer by rigid rods of length @xmath46 , or @xmath47for a model with elastic rods .",
    "note that the saturation of the hydrogen bond has been incorporated by the requirement @xmath48 and so on .",
    "once the nucleotide at @xmath49 has interacted with the nucleotide at @xmath50 it can not interact with the nucleotide at @xmath51 .",
    "note that in ( [ z ] ) , only the enthalpy and combinatorics of pairings are included .",
    "the integration over the atomic coordinates in ( [ z1 ] ) accounts for the actual topological feasibility of a given pairing and also for the entropic factor associated with loop formation .",
    "biologists are interested in the folded configuration essentially at room temperature .",
    "since room temperature is substantially less than the melting temperature ( of order @xmath52c , in other words , the characteristic energy scale of the problem ) , we want to determine the ground state configuration of the rna heteropolymer . in other words , once we have obtained @xmath53 we would like to extract the term in @xmath53 that dominates as @xmath54 tends to infinity in ( [ vij ] ) .    we have given a simplified quantitative framework for the rna folding problem . from a chemical point of view , it would be appropriate to include also the stacking energies of couples of complementary base pairs , instead of energies of single pairs of bases .",
    "however , in the following , we will stick with the latter .",
    "we will also concentrate on the evaluation of the `` pairing '' partition function ( [ z ] ) .",
    "we expect that the various effects we have ignored , such as stacking , etc ... , can be added later as `` bells and whistles '' to our approach .",
    "the stacking energies for instance can be taken into account by utilizing a @xmath55 interaction matrix between pairs of bases instead of the @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 we use here .",

    "2b : representation of the same rna stretched .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , let us borrow the terminology of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the dotted lines are known as gluon propagators , and the solid line as a quark propagator .",
    "the secondary structure corresponds to diagrams in which the gluon lines do not cross over each other , while the tertiary structure corresponds to diagrams in which the gluon lines do cross .",
    "the crucial observation , originally made by t hooft @xcite , is that there is a systematic relation between the topology of a graph and its corresponding power of @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , planar diagrams are of order @xmath58 , and diagrams in which gluon lines cross are of higher order",
    ". we merely have to go to the large @xmath23 expansion , and the diagrams are classified by powers of @xmath2 .",
    "note that a somewhat similar formulation in terms of matrix theory has been used for the meander problem @xcite .",
    "consider the quantity @xmath59 here @xmath60 @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 denote @xmath25 independent @xmath23 by @xmath23 hermitian matrices and @xmath64 represents the ordered matrix product @xmath65 all matrix products will be understood as ordered in this paper .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath66 is defined by @xmath67    let us refer to the row and column indices @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the matrices @xmath70 as color indices , with @xmath71 .",
    "the matrix integral ( [ matrep ] ) defines a matrix theory with @xmath25 matrices .",

    "another trivial remark is that we can effectively remove @xmath75 from ( [ matrep ] ) .",
    "the important remark is that the matrix theory @xcite defined by ( [ matrep ] ) has the same topological structure as t hooft s large @xmath23 quantum chromodynamics .",
    "there are @xmath25 types of gluons , and the gluon propagators are given by @xmath76 as in large @xmath23 quantum chromodynamics , each gluon propagator is associated with a factor of @xmath77 and each color loop is associated with a factor of @xmath78 the reader familiar with matrix theory or large @xmath23 quantum chromodynamics can see immediately that the gaussian matrix integral ( [ matrep ] ) evaluates precisely to the infinite series @xmath79 some `` typical '' terms in this series correspond to the diagrams in fig .  3 .",
    "= 0.5    fig .  3 : graphical representation of a few terms of the partition function .",
    "this differs from ( [ z ] ) only in that the terms with different topological character are now classified by inverse powers of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the use of the large @xmath23 expansion allows us to separate out the tertiary structure , represented in ( [ z1l ] ) for example by the term @xmath81 from the secondary structure .",
    "note that the ordered product @xmath64 ensures that the diagonal elements @xmath32 of the matrix @xmath82 do not appear in @xmath83 .",
    "we have nevertheless already set @xmath32 to 0 .",
    "the program proposed in this paper is thus to evaluate @xmath83 with @xmath82 an arbitrary matrix .",
    "once @xmath83 is known we can then insert it into ( [ z1 ] ) to evaluate @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 serves as a convenient marker to distinguish the tertiary structure from the secondary structure .",
    "what we offer here is a systematic way of generating refinements to the calculation of @xmath85 and hence the free energy @xmath86 to any desired accuracy in a well controlled approximation .    since in @xmath83",
    "the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath25 represent arbitrary labels we can just as well define @xmath88 where again the normalization is given by    @xmath89    as we shall see in the following , we will construct recursion relations to evaluate ( [ zmn ] ) approximately .",
    "these recursion relations can be easily programmed to calculate the free energy of the rna chain .",
    "in the matrix representation ( [ matrep ] ) @xmath23 appears implicitly in the size of the matrices @xmath90 in order to study the large @xmath23 limit , we need to extract the @xmath23 dependence explicitly , for which we have developed the following method .",
    "define @xmath91 by @xmath92 for @xmath93 @xmath94 for all @xmath95 and @xmath96 then @xmath91 satisfies the equation @xmath97 thus , if we define @xmath98  then we see that @xmath99 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath100 and thus @xmath101 we have used the standard representation of the inverse of a matrix by an integral over grassmanian fermionic variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 note the felicitous fact that @xmath104 which allows us to write ( [ zrep ] ) without a denominator .",
    "to compactify this representation of @xmath53 further we introduce @xmath105 and write @xmath106 henceforth , it is understood that after differentiation with respect to @xmath107 we set @xmath107 to 0 .",
    "we can now perform the gaussian integration over @xmath108 , thus obtaining @xmath109 with the free fermion action @xmath110 and the interacting fermion action @xmath111 note that in ( [ ints ] ) we have displayed the color indices @xmath68 and @xmath69 explicitly .",
    "we next rewrite @xmath112 in terms of the color singlet variable @xmath113 now use the gaussian representation @xmath114 with the normalization factor @xmath115 note that even though @xmath116 is complex we can take @xmath9 to be hermitean .",
    "( equivalently , the anti - hermitean part of @xmath9 drops out . )",
    "putting it together we obtain @xmath117 where @xmath118 or in matrix form    @xmath119    where we have used the convenient notation @xmath120    the point of these manipulations is that in ( [ repp ] ) we have now isolated the color index @xmath68 so that the integral over @xmath121 and @xmath122 factors into @xmath23 copies of the same integral , thus giving @xmath123 at this point , we can differentiate with respect to @xmath107 and set @xmath107 to 0 , obtaining the alternative form @xmath124 in this expression , @xmath125 let us introduce the action @xmath126 and define the average of an `` observable '' @xmath127 by @xmath128 ( note the non - standard normalization used here . ) then , our result can be summarized elegantly as @xmath129    at this point , as remarked earlier , we note that the quantity @xmath83 can obviously be generalized to @xmath130 : after all , the site labels @xmath87 and @xmath25 are arbitrary .",
    "then we have the appealing result that @xmath131    it is also useful to introduce the free action @xmath132 and to define @xmath133 then we can also write our result as @xmath134    remarkably , it turns out that we will need both the representations ( [ bbbbb ] ) and ( [ b0 ] ) later in a single calculation .",
    "incidentally , our formulation of the rna folding problem can be immediately adapted to the marriage problem ( or bipartite matching problem ) @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite , one of the classic problems in combinatorial optimization .",
    "we will mention only the simplest version here .",
    "label @xmath25 ( with @xmath25 even ) individuals by the index @xmath135 @xmath136 where the individual is male for @xmath49 odd and female for @xmath49 even .",
    "define a matrix @xmath137 where @xmath138 represents the energy cost of a marriage between @xmath49 and @xmath50 and its negative provides a measure of happiness . referring back to ( [ z ] ) we see that we want to extract in @xmath83 all the terms with @xmath139 powers of @xmath140 for example the term @xmath141 with @xmath142 since we now want to include possible crossings in the feynman diagram language we can set the number of colors @xmath23 to 1 .",
    "thus , from ( [ res1 ] ) , we have immediately @xmath143 referring to ( [ matrix ] ) we see that the differentiation with respect to @xmath107 and setting @xmath107 to 0 amounts to replacing the @xmath144 by @xmath144 matrix @xmath145 by the @xmath25 by @xmath25 matrix obtained by deleting the first row and last column . furthermore , since we want the terms with @xmath139 powers of @xmath146 that is , with @xmath25 powers of @xmath147 we can set the @xmath87 s and @xmath148 s in this matrix to 0 . denoting the resulting matrix by @xmath149 ,",
    "we obtain the following representation for the marriage problem @xmath150    clearly , the representation given here can be generalized in a number of directions , for example , by including individuals who remain single .",
    "it is easy to see how this representation works : the gaussian integration insures that in @xmath151 only the appropriate terms are picked out .",
    "the fact that we have been able to display explicitly the @xmath23 dependence is crucial and allows us in principle to carry the @xmath24 expansion to any order .",
    "the standard strategy to evaluate integrals such as ( [ res2 ] ) is of course to use the method of steepest descent ( @xcite,@xcite ) .    to leading order",
    "the steepest descent approximation is easy enough to carry out .",

    "this equation ( [ grec ] ) has already been written down in the literature @xcite and is known as the `` hartree approximation '' .",
    "it has the obvious interpretation ( see fig .",
    "4 ) that to lowest order the additive effect of including one extra nucleotide labelled by @xmath144 to the rna heteropolymer can be described by pairing that nucleotide to the nucleotide labeled by @xmath162 which separates the heteropolymer into two segments , one from @xmath87 to @xmath50 and the other from @xmath163 to @xmath144 .",

    "do not disrupt the secondary structure , but merely add new interactions , in addition to the existing secondary pairing .",
