    "type  iin supernovae ( sne  iin ) have raised important questions about the latest phases of evolution in massive stars , because they require enhanced or episodic mass loss shortly before core collapse that far exceeds known examples of steady winds ( see @xcite for a general review of mass loss and its connection to interacting sne ) .",
    "sne  iin have relatively narrow lines of hydrogen in their spectra ( see @xcite for a review of sn spectral classification ) caused by slow - moving circumstellar material ( csm ) that is hit by the blast wave or illuminated by ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from the sn . in some extreme cases , as much as 1025m@xmath3 seems to have been ejected in just the decade before core collapse @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "the luminosity enhancement is more modest , but the csm is still dense enough to correspond to the strongest known winds from extreme and unstable red supergiants ( rsgs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sne  iin are about 89% of all observed core - collapse sne @xcite , so the physical trigger of the most violent precursors only operates in a subset of core - collapse events .",
    "a key issue is the timing of this mass loss .",
    "are these eruptions synchronized to go off just before the sn owing to instabilities in the final ne , o , and si burning stages of their progenitors @xcite ?",
    "we suspect that pre - sn instability may be more widespread than indicated by the observed fraction of traditional sne  iin noted above , since these may be only the most extreme manifestation of a more generic phenomenon @xcite . at a less extreme level , some sne show type  iin signatures for just a day or so after explosion @xcite , which can only be seen if they are discovered early . at the other extreme , major mass - loss episodes also seem to precede core collapse by centuries or millennia . in the latter case , it could take months or years for the blast wave to reach the csm .",
    "this may often go undetected as follow - up sn observations rarely extend past the first few months because of sensitivity limits or observers compulsion to turn their attention to newer sne .",
    "there are some observed cases of significantly delayed onset of csm interaction .",
    "most famously , sn  1987a began to collide with its csm ring nebula after roughly a decade @xcite , and in this case velocities of the ring nebula indicate that it was ejected 1020 thousand years prior @xcite .",
    "this interaction was relatively modest compared to that of sne  iin , however , and did not lead to a huge increase in luminosity that would have been observable in a distant galaxy .",
    "an interesting case is sn  2008iy , which did show a large increase in luminosity after a delay .",
    "initially it had an absolute magnitude of about @xmath4 , similar to a normal sn  ii - p with no csm interaction , but then brightened to about @xmath5mag after 400 days as the sn caught up to a massive shell ejected a century earlier @xcite .",
    "sn  2001em and more recently sn  2014c represent cases in which a stripped - envelope explosion crashed into a h - rich shell after a year or more and developed strong , relatively narrow h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "infrared ( ir ) echoes from csm dust illuminated by the sn itself @xcite or by ongoing interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) also provide evidence for massive distant shells .",
    "an extreme case is sn  2006gy , which  in addition to its @xmath6m@xmath3 shell ejected only 8yr before core collapse @xcite  also had another more distant shell of 1020m@xmath3 ejected @xmath2yr earlier @xcite .",
    "yet another case of a very massive dust shell seen as an echo is sn  2002hh @xcite , although interestingly , this aging sn does not yet show signs of shock interaction with this shell even though it probably should have reached it by now @xcite . for sn  2005ip , the sn considered in this paper , @xcite interpreted the ir echo properties as indicating a past major mass - loss outburst that was followed by a less intense wind .",
    "we therefore have mounting evidence of major mass - loss episodes that precede core collapse by centuries or millennia , and not just in the few years beforehand .",
    "if the precursor outbursts of sne  iin in the decade prior to core collapse can be linked to final nuclear burning phases @xcite , then what can give rise to older mass ejections ?",
    "wave - driven mass loss during ne and o burning can only drive significant mass loss for a few years before core collapse , according to current models @xcite .",
    "additional observations are needed to constrain the physical parameters and time dependence , but there is mounting evidence of enhanced mass loss on much longer timescales than ne and o burning .",
    "@xcite notes that the pulsational pair mechanism can produce mass - loss eruptions that precede core collapse on a variety of timescales , but these come from very massive stars and should be relatively rare ( and the eruptions might not be punctuated by an energetic sn , as material falls back to a black hole ) .",
    "this poses an interesting observational question : what fraction of sne ( including otherwise normal sne ) have much more extended dense shells ?",
    "for this reason , we have been monitoring some old , nearby sne to look for changes in their late - time interaction .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the aging event sn",
    "2005ip , an unusual sn  iin located in the host galaxy ngc  2906 at a distance of @xmath730 mpc . @xcite presented the optical photometric and spectroscopic evolution over the first @xmath8d , while @xcite discussed the ir photometric evolution over the same time period .",
    "sn  2005ip was notable among sne  iin for its sustained strong csm interaction at late times , its rather unusual high - ionization spectrum with strong coronal emission lines and a strong blue pseudocontinuum , and its strong ir emission from dust .",
    "sn  2005ip showed some evidence for the formation of new dust at these early times @xcite , although @xcite concluded that the ir emission was likely produced by a combination of new dust formation and an ir echo from pre - existing csm dust .",
    "@xcite considered distant dust shells of various radii to explain the ir echo , and @xcite favoured a dust shell located @xmath9pc from the star to explain the ir echo evolution .",
    "this is similar to the radius where we infer late - time csm interaction in sn  2005ip , so it is possible that the variability of h@xmath0 emission that we report here is caused by the ejecta hitting shells that were seen as an ir echo at earlier times .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    "overall , the early - time data suggested a scenario wherein the sn blast wave was interacting with a very dense and clumpy rsg wind having a mass - loss rate of more than @xmath10m@xmath3yr@xmath11 and likely around @xmath12m@xmath3yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this points to an extreme rsg akin to vy  cma , rather than a normal rsg like @xmath0  ori @xcite .",
    "subsequent papers followed the continuing evolution of sn  2005ip as it faded during the decade after explosion . by 18002400d after discovery , the h@xmath0 flux had dropped by about a factor of 10 @xcite , although this was still much stronger than typical interacting sne at a comparable epoch .",
    "@xcite also drew similar conclusions as @xcite concerning the evidence for dust formation and the nature of the progenitor s mass loss , and @xcite mentioned that the x - ray and h@xmath0 fluxes seem to provide consistent results .",
    "@xcite also presented a late - time ( day 3024 ) optical spectrum of sn  2005ip , showing evidence for continued interaction .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of x - ray emission from sn  2005ip during the @xmath13d after discovery .",
    "they found that the x - ray luminosity was roughly constant until 2009 and dropped by a factor of two by 2012 .",
    "they also showed that the absorbing column density ( @xmath14 ) appeared to be steadily declining during the same time period .",
    "this prompted @xcite to suggest that the progenitor had ejected a massive csm shell in the centuries before explosion , and that after @xmath15yr , the blast wave was finally emerging from this shell , which they estimated to have a total mass of @xmath16m@xmath3 swept up by that time .",
    "this implied that the epoch of csm interaction was coming to an end in sn  2005ip .    here",
    "we show that csm interaction clearly has not yet finished .",
    "the csm interaction intensity , traced by h@xmath0 luminosity , continued to decline very slowly until about mid 2015 .",
    "after that time , however , the h@xmath0 showed abrupt variations , including a brightening by late 2015 and early 2016 .",
    "the radio and x - ray emission was also bright in early 2016 , as described below .",
    "this indicates that the blast wave has continued to run into a distant csm shell or torus .",
    "we explore possible explanations for the origin of this csm and implications for the pre - sn evolution of massive stars .",
    "for comparison , we also discuss similar continued interaction via late - time h@xmath0 emission seen in newly obtained spectra of sne  1988z , 1993j , and 1998s .",
    ".late - time optical spectroscopy of sn  2005ip [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : radio ]",
    "we obtained late - time optical spectroscopy of sn  2005ip over several epochs since our previous study @xcite .",
    "these observations included the bluechannel ( bc ) spectrograph on the 6.5 m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) , the multi - object double spectrograph ( mods ; @xcite ) on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) , the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) mounted on the 10 m keck  i telescope , and the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; @xcite ) on keck  ii .",
    "details of the spectral observations including measurements of the total h@xmath0 line flux are summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] , and the spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "standard reductions were carried out using iraf including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and optimal spectral extraction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "flux calibration was achieved using spectrophotometric standards observed at similar airmass to that of each science frame , and the resulting spectra were median combined into a single one - dimensional spectrum . for one observation noted in table  [ tab : spec ] , the flux calibration was suspect owing to clouds that came in during subsequent exposures . for this date ( day 3425 ) we increase the uncertainty in figure  [ fig : lha ] to @xmath17% .    _",
    "sn 1988z : _ in our study , we find it useful to compare the evolution of sn  2005ip to that of a few other well - studied , geriatric sne with late - time interaction .",
    "sn  1988z is a prototypical , long - lasting , and radio - luminous sn  iin that has been studied in detail by several authors @xcite . in particular , @xcite have compiled multiwavelength data , including h@xmath0 fluxes , up to day @xmath73000 . we have obtained additional unpublished late - time spectra of this aging sn  iin using the keck observatory , with both lris and deimos .",
    "these observations , including estimated h@xmath0 line fluxes , are summarized in table  [ tab:88z ] and almost triple the time baseline for this object .",
    "this series of new late - time spectra of sn  1988z is shown in figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] .",
    "these spectra have been corrected for a redshift of @xmath18 , but no reddening correction has been applied as in previous studies @xcite . when we plot the h@xmath0 line luminosity in figure  [ fig : lha ] , we first subtract a constant flux of @xmath19ergs@xmath11@xmath20 , which is the mean value of the narrow h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] line fluxes in late - time spectra ( this is only significant for the last epochs ) .",
    "we attribute this constant narrow emission to contamination by coincident or nearby h  ii region emission , or perhaps unshocked distant csm .",
    "since we compare the h@xmath0 luminosity of sn  2005ip to sn  1988z and also to other well - studied late interactors , we obtained late - time spectra to extend the temporal coverage of two additional prototypical sne .    _",
    "sn  1993j : _ we procured several late - time spectra of sn  1993j , most recently on 2016 feb .",
    "10 using lris on keck i. sn  1993j was a type ib event rather than a type iin , but it was very nearby in m81 , was discovered within about 1 day of explosion , and has shown strong , long - lived csm interaction that has given rise to a high radio luminosity and prominent optical / uv emission lines for more than a decade after explosion @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab:93j ] summarizes our late - time spectra reported here , including a measurement of the total h@xmath0 line flux in the calibrated spectra . here",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the fact that the blue side of h@xmath0 is blended with a strong oxygen line , as well as uncertainty from possible slit losses .",
    "qualitatively , the spectral appearance of sn  1993j changes very little at these late epochs after day 4000 , and even resembles the day 2454 spectrum presented by @xcite .",
    "the most recent epoch is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] in dark green ; we also show two earlier epochs on days 4249 and 6159 in a lighter shade of green for comparison .",
    "although some of the emission lines have weakened with time , the line profiles and overall appearance of the spectrum have not changed much .",
    "_ sn  1998s : _ this has long been considered a prototypical sn  iin , which was discovered within about a day of explosion , but its early csm interaction was on the weak side compared to most sne  iin @xcite .",
    "sn  1998s did , however , exhibit strong continued csm interaction at late times @xcite .",
    "we obtained a late epoch of sn  1998s on 2016 mar .",
    "1 using deimos on keck ii , extending the spectral evolution by @xmath21d compared to published data . the last previously published spectrum of sn  1998s @xcite was obtained on day 5079 , and our new spectrum corresponds to day 6574 .",
    "qualitatively , the appearance of this spectrum shows little change compared to the last one published by @xcite . for this spectrum , however , we measure a strong h@xmath0 line flux of @xmath22ergs@xmath11@xmath20 , which is several times higher than our previous flux measurement @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty is likely to be dominated by absolute flux calibration and slit placement as noted above for sn  2005ip and sn  1988z , but this increase appears to be significant .",

    "in addition to h@xmath0 , the spectrum shows consistent emission from other lines commonly seen in late - time spectra of strongly interacting sne  iin .",

    "spectra ) are able to cleanly resolve the intermediate - width emission of the post - shock gas from the narrow pre - shock csm or underlying h  ii region emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] ) . in these spectra",
    ", the intermediate - width component of h@xmath0 ( within about @xmath53 km s@xmath11 ) has a consistent profile shape , which is asymmetric and shifted to the blue .",
    "the peak of this emission is located roughly at @xmath54 to @xmath55 km s@xmath11 , shifting toward more positive velocities with time .",
    "this asymmetric blueshifted profile was seen at early times in the broad and intermediate - width lines @xcite , and was attributed to new dust formation in the sn ejecta or in the post - shock gas .",
    "blueshifted lines with this type of shape can arise simply from occultation of the far side by the sn photosphere at early times @xcite , but the fact that the blueshifted asymmetry persists for a decade in sn  2005ip , long after the continuum opacity of the photosphere has vanished , means that the blocking of the red side of the lines must be caused by dust mixed within the sn ( or to intrinsically asymmetric csm ) .",
    "much of the dust is likely to be mixed in the post - shock region where the intermediate - width h@xmath0 originates , since even early - time spectra showed a blueshift in lines formed within the post - shock shell , as well as in the broad sn ejecta lines @xcite .",
    "the narrowest components from the pre - shock csm are unresolved or only marginally resolved in our spectra , indicating expansion speeds of 80 km s@xmath11 or less ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of the h@xmath0 line luminosity is shown in figure  [ fig : lha ] .",
    "this plot uses h@xmath0 line fluxes in the first 1000 d from our earlier paper @xcite , and supplements these with our new spectra of sn  2005ip reported here .",
    "the line fluxes were converted to h@xmath0 luminosity with the same assumptions as in our earlier study .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity remains roughly constant for the first 1000 d , as we noted earlier , and then declines slowly over the next several years as found previously by @xcite .",
    "our new spectra show that this slow decline continued to around day @xmath31 ( mid 2015 ) , when the h@xmath0 luminosity was in decline , and then suddenly reversed to be on a quick rise that has continued to the time of writing .",
    "additional monitoring will be needed to determine how high it will rise , if it levels off , or fades again .",
    "possible causes of this are discussed further in section 4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lha ] also compares the h@xmath0 luminosity of sn  2005ip to that of several other sne with strong late - time interaction .",
    "we see here that sn  2005ip really is quite unusual , with a sustained h@xmath0 luminosity that was essentially the same as the current record holder for such interaction : sn  1988z ( see below ) . at days 10002000 ,",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity was 2 orders of magnitude stronger than in some other well - studied objects like sn  1998s @xcite , sn  1980k @xcite , and sn  1993j @xcite , and an order of magnitude stronger than in the sn  iin ptf11iqb @xcite .",
    "the late - time csm interaction in these other objects can be explained by a very strong rsg wind with @xmath56 m@xmath3 yr@xmath11 , but sn  2005ip and sn  1988z are clearly more extreme situations .",
    "thus , the h@xmath0 luminosity implies that around 4000 days after explosion , the shock is interacting with a wind that had a mass - loss rate of at least @xmath12 m@xmath3 yr@xmath11 . with a csm speed resolution limit of our data , and similar to csm speeds for sn  1998s seen in echelle spectra @xcite .",
    "] around 40 km s@xmath11 , this implies that the high mass - loss rate was occurring within a few thousand years before core collapse .",
    "this , in turn , requires several m@xmath3 being lost from the star in the last few millennia of its life .",
    "our estimate is conservative compared with some others , which favour higher rates of @xmath57 m@xmath3 yr@xmath11 and total csm masses greater than 10 m@xmath3 @xcite .    in our earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we drew comparisons between sn  2005ip and sn  1988z , including a direct comparison of the h@xmath0 luminosity . during the first several hundred days ,",
    "sn  2005ip was significantly less luminous in both h@xmath0 and continuum emission .",
    "however , during this time sn  2005ip remained roughly constant in h@xmath0 luminosity , while sn  1988z steadily declined .",
    "figure  [ fig : lha ] extends this same comparison , and shows that by day 1000 the two objects had about the same luminosity , and for the rest of its first decade , sn  2005ip was an almost exact twin of sn  1988z in terms of its csm interaction strength traced by h@xmath0 .",
    "as in our previous paper , figure  [ fig : lha ] incorporates h@xmath0 luminosities for sn  1988z published by @xcite , extended to almost day 3000 by @xcite .",
    "we also supplement these published h@xmath0 luminosities with measurements from our own spectra of sn  1988z ( see table  [ tab:88z ] ) .    with its recent resurgence in h@xmath0 luminosity ,",
    "sn  2005ip equals sn  1988z again at a comparable epoch , making it tied as the record holder for the highest late - time h@xmath0 luminosity at + 10yr . integrating through time in figure  [ fig : lha ] , the total energy radiated by sn  2005ip in the h@xmath0 line alone is @xmath58erg . for comparison ,",
    "the total integrated 0.310kev x - ray energy is about a factor of 10 larger at @xmath59erg , and the integrated optical luminosity yields a similar total radiated energy of @xmath59erg .",
    "this is certainly an underestimate of the total radiated energy , since we appled no correction for flux at other wavelengths .",
    "the asymmetric blueshifted profiles of h@xmath0 , in particular , suggest some dust extinction in sn  2005ip ( with a lack of such evidence for dust extinction in sn  1988z ) ; correcting for this could raise the h@xmath0 and continuum luminosities further , and thus make sn  2005ip significantly more luminous than sn  1988z .",
    "the radiated energy so far is therefore likely to be at least @xmath60erg for sn  2005ip .",
    "the kinetic energy imparted to the swept - up csm shell ( about 10m@xmath3 accelerated to @xmath61kms@xmath11 ) is roughly @xmath62erg .",
    "thus , csm interaction may have already tapped a substantial fraction of the explosion energy in sn  2005ip ; remaining kinetic energy of the freely expanding ejecta that are still inside the reverse shock may power sn  2005ip for the next decade",
    ". it will be interesting to see where it goes from here .",
    "a significant detail is that after it rebrightened , the spectrum showed stronger emission from the intermediate - width components of [ o  i ] @xmath636300 , 6364 , which had only shown narrow pre - shock csm emission before that time .",
    "this may hint that we are starting to see an increased contribution from the reverse - shock luminosity ( see section 3.3 below ) .      despite its redshift of 0.022 , sn  1988z has remained detectable for nearly three decades .",
    "it was a very luminous radio sn that has been studied extensively as it faded slowly after discovery , showing remarkable longevity in the radio , x - rays , and optical emission lines like h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been compared to sn  1986j , and most studies of its first decade and a half favour the interpretation that it is powered by an energetic explosion ( as much as @xmath64erg ; @xcite ) from a massive progenitor ( an initial mass of something like 2030m@xmath3 or more ) , that was interacting with roughly 10m@xmath3 produced by a star that had a wind with a mass - loss rate of @xmath65m@xmath3yr@xmath11 for @xmath66yr before core collapse .",
    "the rate of decline in h@xmath0 and radio suggested that the mass - loss rate ramped up in the final millennium before core collapse @xcite .",
    "even the somewhat lower mass - loss rate traced by later csm interaction was extreme , however , allowing sn  1988z to remain as one of the most radio luminous sne even after a decade , matched only by sn  2005ip .",
    "here we present a series of optical spectra , listed in table  [ tab:88z ] and shown in figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] , which extend this late - time evolution from the mid-1990s to the present epoch .",
    "we find that sn  1988z s strong csm interaction has continued to fade very slowly , indicating a remarkably extended and dense wind into which the blast wave continues to crash .",
    "this traces mass loss over @xmath67yr preceeding core collapse .",
    "based on the luminosity of h@xmath0 and the character of the optical spectra , we group sn  1988z s late evolution into a few different epochs :    \\(1 ) _ the first 5003000 days_. this is the phase that has already been studied extensively as noted above . during this time , sn  1988z showed a steady and very slow decline in radio and h@xmath0 luminosity , although remaining far more luminous than most sne having signs of csm interaction .",
    "@xcite noted a possible break in the decline rate of the h@xmath0 luminosity around day 1000 , although this break is not clear in figure  [ fig : lha ] where the decline looks rather continuous within the uncertainties .",
    "of interest in the present paper is that throughout the time period of roughly 10003000 days , sn  2005ip was a nearly identical twin of sn  1988z in terms of its decline rate , its luminosity in the radio ( admittedly only a single epoch so far for sn  2005ip ) , h@xmath0 , and x - rays , and in the appearance of its spectrum . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we noted similarities in the spectra of sn  2005ip and sn  1988z at early times , although sn  2005ip exhibited stronger coronal lines . from day 1000 to 3000 , however , their spectra are almost indistinguishable .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] includes a recent spectrum of sn  2005ip on day 3098 for comparison , which appears very similar to the days 2006 and 2542 spectra of sn  1988z in the same plot .",
    "this phase is characterized by very strong intermediate - width h@xmath0 , a steep h@xmath0/h@xmath68 decrement of @xmath69 , several intermediate - width and narrow coronal lines such as [ fe  vii ] , and intermediate - width lines that indicate very high electron densities in the post - shock gas , such as [ n  ii ] @xmath705755 ( which is , however , blended with an [ fe  vii ] line ) .",
    "\\(2 ) _ a `` plateau '' over days 30007000_. during this time period , the h@xmath0 luminosity appears to level - off for a decade .",
    "while h@xmath0 remains constant , the rest of the spectrum shows some interesting changes .",
    "the coronal lines and other indicators of high density fade away , leaving mostly narrow h  ii region lines and broad , weak oxygen lines ( possibly from the reverse shock ; see below ) that are also seen in young sn remnants .",
    "the intermediate - width h@xmath68 line also fades , yielding an h@xmath0/h@xmath68 ratio that is higher than before ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) _ after day 7000 .",
    "_ eventually , other lines fade away too , leaving only intermediate - width h@xmath0 , which also resumed a decline in flux at these very late times .",
    "even the broad / intermediate - width oxygen lines mostly disappear .",
    "note that in figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] , we have subtracted a constant value for the contribution of narrow h@xmath0+[n  ii ] emission from underlying h  ii regions in the spectrum , which typically contributes about @xmath19ergs@xmath11@xmath20 in our keck slit aperture after subtraction of adjacent background .",
    "this suggests that sn  1988z resides in or near a complex of h  ii regions , providing another possible indication of a high initial mass for the progenitor . at sn",
    "1988z s distance of @xmath72mpc , however , @xmath73 corresponds to almost 500pc , which could include a large complex of h  ii regions like the tarantula nebula , and is not a very reliable or precise indicator of initial mass .",
    "it is , however , a good indicator of a relatively strong ambient uv radiation field .",
    "this last point is interesting in the context of something we discuss later .",
    "namely , @xcite have suggested that external ionization of an otherwise normal rsg wind can produce a stalled dense shell , which might offer an alternative to very strong or eruptive mass loss as an origin for sne  iin . despite its probable location in an h  ii region , this idea does not seem to apply well to sn  1988z , which from its earliest phases shows an uninterrupted decline in csm interaction strength , consistent with a strong shock moving through a freely expanding wind .",
    "the total mass of 1520m@xmath3 or more of csm that has been swept up so far by sn  1988z rules out a normal rsg wind that has been confined to a thin shell , because such shells only contain a fraction ( about a third ) of the total rsg mass loss , and are therefore expected to have much lower total mass @xcite .",
    "with such a strong wind , the expected location of a stalled shell would probably be different from the models presented by @xcite , however .",
    "we return to this issue later , because despite its similarity to sn  1988z , sn  2005ip does show a rapid interruption of the smooth decline in its csm interaction strength , which might be indicative of external influence of this sort .",
    "this may hint that two otherwise very similar events may have their csm modified in different ways .",
    "then again , the relatively coarse sampling of sn  1988z in its past decade does not rule out the possibility of some brief drops or spikes in luminosity indicative of density fluctuations in its csm .",
    "indeed , one may speculate that the late plateau phase in sn  1988z s h@xmath0 luminosity might represent the shock traversing a relatively constant density , ionized portion of the wind outside such a neutral dense shell .",
    "for this reason as well , it will be interesting to see how sn  2005ip behaves in the coming decade as compared to sn  1988z .",
    "all the sne discussed in this paper show signs of long - lived , strong csm interaction , but there are interesting differences . examining figures  [ fig : spectra ] and [ fig : spectra88z ] , it is clear that both sn  2005ip and sn  1988z have late - time spectra dominated by their intermediate - width components of h@xmath0 and other lines , with line widths of about 2000kms@xmath11 .",
    "both sn  1993j and sn  1998s have significantly broader line profiles of 500010,000kms@xmath11 .",
    "this difference is probably closely linked to their total h@xmath0 luminosity . both sn  2005ip and sn  1988z are @xmath74 orders of magnitude more luminous than the other two at a comparable late epoch .",
    "the combination of higher h@xmath0 luminosity ( as well as higher radio and x - ray luminosities ) , high - density tracers , and narrower lines likely stems from the same cause : _ denser csm and a radiative forward shock_. if a blast wave is expanding into extremely dense and extended csm , the forward shock can remain radiative , giving higher csm interaction luminosity and causing the intermediate - width components to continue to dominate the spectrum as the blast wave continues to expand into the csm and to decelerate slowly .",
    "( strong global asymmetry or a high degree of clumping can provide very high csm densities without necessarily having a huge total csm mass , so an intermediate - width component might also be present at lower luminosity in some cases . )    at lower average csm densities and luminosities , as in sn  1993j and sn  1998s , radiation from the reverse shock dominates the late - time emission , and so the spectrum exhibits much broader lines from oxygen - rich sn ejecta crossing the reverse shock . in our late spectra of sn  1993j , the flat - topped and double - peaked profiles described by @xcite still persist",
    ". these may be the result of interaction with a disk - like csm , which pinches the waist of the csm interaction region and makes the reverse shock brighter at the equator .",
    "one may envision a reverse - shock geometry similar to that of sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we may see a transitional phase in sn  1988z , where weak and broad oxygen lines remain after the intermediate - width coronal lines have faded ( days 5138 and 6640 in figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] ) .",
    "in general , though , the lack of strong oxygen lines in most sne  iin at a few hundred days after explosion is most likely a consequence of the fact that the forward shock still dominates the emission spectrum . since this is tracing shock - heated csm material , it reflects the composition of the csm and not the composition of the inner ejecta .",
    "thus , a lack of strong oxygen features should not be taken as any indication of the abundances in the sn ejecta as long as intermediate - width lines are still seen .",
    "another relevant detail concerns the line profiles . while sn  2005ip and sn  1988z are otherwise very similar , they differ in that sn  2005ip shows asymmetric blueshifted line profiles , especially in its intermediate - width h@xmath0 line at late times ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the intermediate - width h@xmath0 components of sn  1988z remain much more symmetric at all epochs ( figure  [ fig : spectra88z ] ) .",
    "this could signify a difference in dust - formation efficiency in the two sne , or perhaps viewing - angle effects if the csm interaction is not spherically symmetric ( for example , sn  1988z could be a ring or disk - like interaction seen pole - on , in which case dust can not block emission from receding material ) .",
    "interestingly , the late - time line profiles of sn  1998s , and to a somewhat lesser extent sn  1993j , do show blueshifted asymmetry that may be indicative of dust formation in these sne .",
    "this was already discussed in detail for the case of sn  1998s by @xcite .",

    "sn  2005ip appears very similar in its radio luminosity to sn  1988z at a comparable epoch , which is perhaps not surprising in light of the h@xmath0 results above .",
    "the best fit to the observed radio light curve of sn  1988z is based on a five - parameter model derived from @xcite :    @xmath76    with @xmath77 , and @xmath78 as free parameters .",

    "these parameters imply that the sn progenitor underwent mass loss of at least @xmath85m@xmath3yr@xmath11 for the last 10,000  yr before exploding .",
    "sn  2005ip is about 20% less luminous than sn 1988z at 5  ghz and @xmath86 days , but it is a factor of a few more luminous in x - rays at the same epoch .",
    "analysis of x - rays suggests significantly larger mass - loss rates of @xmath12 to @xmath87m@xmath3yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to infer the physical parameters of the csm surrounding sn 2005ip based on a single epoch of radio observations .",
    "however , given the similarity between sne  2005ip and 1988z at both optical and radio wavelengths , we can hypothesize that sn  2005ip has an extremely dense and clumpy csm profile out to large radii .",

    "-0.0 true cm , but allows for a more direct comparison with sn  1988z .",
    "the two sne overlap in x - ray luminosity in this energy band , but have somewhat different deecay rates.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]      as noted in section 2.3 , the rate of fading of the x - ray luminosity of sn  2005ip implies a csm density that falls off more steeply than for a steady wind with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which should yield a @xmath90 profile in the case of free - free emission from a wind .",
    "this would imply that the star s mass - loss rate was ramping up in the last few thousand years of its life as it approached core collapse .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with implications from the h@xmath0 evolution noted above .",
    "the wind density being steeper than a steady wind is also consistent with the earlier analysis of x - rays by @xcite .",
    "looking at x - rays alone , the rate of fading appears to be consistent with a continuation of the trend inferred by @xcite .",
    "this is interesting , since the h@xmath0 luminosity shows a more sudden drop followed by a resurgence in recent data .",
    "it is possible that the coarse time sampling of the x - ray data has missed this peculiar variability , so future additional x - ray observations are required to resolve this .",
    "although the x - rays from sn  2005ip imply a csm that falls off more steeply than a steady wind , it is interesting to note that the x - ray luminosity of sn  1988z falls off even faster with time at a similar epoch after explosion than sn  2005ip ( e.g. , figure  [ fig:05ip88z ] and @xcite ) . note that a direct comparison between x - rays from sn  2005ip and sn  1988z is a bit tricky , because @xcite made somewhat different assumptions in their analysis .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of comparing the two objects in fig  [ fig:05ip88z ] , we have recalibrated our sn  2005ip x - ray data with the same assumptions ( integrated over 0.52kev , uncorrected for intrinsic absorption ) . here",
    "we find that the x - ray luminosities are about the same at @xmath91d , although the somewhat faster decline of sn  2005ip is still apparent . yet , despite this faster decline in x - rays around a decade after explosion , the h@xmath0 luminosity of sn  1988z then hit a plateau and did not decline for another decade after this epoch .",
    "this constant h@xmath0 luminosity seems inconsistent with the steep drop in wind density implied by the x - rays .",
    "overall , it seems that a clear lesson from comparing various diagnostics from different late - time interactors is that any single diagnostic by itself provides an incomplete picture , so readers should be aware that some of the corresponding mass - loss rate estimates are likely to be lower limits .",
    "note that the value of @xmath92 that we derive from radio emission is an order of magnitude lower than from x - ray and h@xmath0 observations of sn  2005ip at the same epoch .",
    "consider the comparison of sn  1988z and sn  2005ip a decade after explosion .",
    "the two have roughly equal x - ray and h@xmath0 luminosities , but sn  1988z is more luminous in radio emission .",
    "a caveat is that the quoted x - ray luminosities are not bolometric x - ray luminosities , although we have tried to recalibrate our sn  2005ip x - ray data in the same way as had been done for sn  1988z @xcite .",
    "one might imagine that these inconsistencies could be attributed to some combination of clumping or aspherical geometry , which can influence the emissivity of h@xmath0 or the escape of x - rays and radio differently for a given csm mass .",
    "dense regions that emit strong h@xmath0 emission might be self absorbed in the radio , for example , and a range of densities may exist simultaneously if the emitting region is clumpy .",
    "@xcite discussed how asymmetry might influence x - ray emission in sne  iin .",
    "we noted earlier that there are some indications of asymmetry and different viewing angles between the two sne ( sn  2005ip shows asymmetric blueshifted line profiles in h@xmath0 that imply dust formation blocks the far side , whereas sn  1988z does not ; this could perhaps be ascribed to a pole - on view of sn  1988z and a nearly edge - on view of sn  2005ip ) .",
    "while such aspects are difficult to constrain with high confidence , the large binary fraction among massive stars @xcite and the high incidence of aspherical geometry in resolved csm around nearby massive stars suggests that effects such as asymmetry and clumping may be the norm rather than an exception .",
    "in this paper we have emphasized the remarkable similarity between the late - time evolution of sn  2005ip and that of sn  1988z , which is the prototypical long - lived sn  iin .",
    "so far there are three main differences in their evolution .    first , the csm interaction in sn  1988z was stronger at early times and declined for the first 1000 days , whereas sn  2005ip had a more delayed onset of its strongest csm interaction .",
    "sn  2005ip s interaction remained roughly constant until day 1000 , after which it tracked that of sn  1988z .",
    "this relatively delayed onset in sn  2005ip was accompanied by stronger narrow coronal emission lines at early times , probably signifying a more highly clumped inner - wind region ( compared to sn  1988z ) , allowing the densest pre - shock regions to be photoionized by x - rays from a very fast blast wave @xcite .",
    "the second major difference is that sn  2005ip has just recently shown a drop and then a quick resurgence in its h@xmath0 luminosity over the course of a few months , indicative of strong density fluctuations in its distant csm .",
    "the recent sudden increase in h@xmath0 would reflect a density increase by a factor of 25 .",
    "sn  1988z has shown no such behaviour , although brief blips can not be ruled out by the coarse time sampling of our late - time sn  1988z spectra . for a blast wave expanding at 20005000kms@xmath11 , fluctuations seen @xmath93 days after sn  2005ip s explosion would correspond to radii of ( 0.61.5 ) @xmath94 cm , or roughly 0.020.05pc from the star .",
    "interestingly , this is consistent with the radius of a warm dust shell responsible for the near / mid - ir echo seen at early times @xcite , which was inferred to reside at @xmath9pc from the star @xcite .",
    "this dust was ascribed to a shell of enhanced density at that location .",
    "it therefere seems likely that the sudden increase in the h@xmath0 luminosity that we observe around day 3500 could in fact be caused by the forward shock reaching and overtaking this same dusty csm shell .",
    "if so , continued study of this interaction may provide a novel way to investigate the destruction or survival of csm dust that is hit by a sn blast wave .",
    "third , despite their similar h@xmath0 luminosity evolution , sn  2005ip declines more slowly in x - rays than sn  1988z , but it is also somewhat less luminous at radio wavelengths than sn  1988z at a comparable epoch ( see sections 3.4 and 3.5 for details and caveats ) .",
    "this suggests that any one diagnostic taken alone gives an incomplete picture of the progenitor mass loss .",
    "the recent h@xmath0 variability suggests that sn  2005ip has strong deviations from a monotonically decreasing wind density at large radii , but what caused this ?",
    "a simple interpretation would be that changes in csm density reflect previous changes in wind mass - loss rate . at a radius of 0.03pc , and with a constant wind speed of @xmath95kms@xmath11 (",
    "somewhat faster wind speeds are appropriate for more luminous rsgs ; see @xcite ) , this would point to substantial changes in mass loss about 1000yr preceding core collapse . as noted in section 1 , sudden bursts of mass loss on these timescales before core collapse do not fall within the realm of currently suggested ideas that involve ne and o burning , which are too brief for objects like sn  2005ip and sn  1988z @xcite . instead , it appears as if the mass - loss rate was ramping up in the last few thousand years before core collapse in sn  2005ip and sn  1988z .",
    "some evidence for such behaviour is observed among nearby populations of rsgs @xcite , and it may be expected theoretically @xcite .",
    "although rsg winds may ramp up near the end of a star s life , strong fluctuations in csm density may point to episodic mass loss akin to eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) or unsteady binary mass - transfer episodes .",
    "indeed , lbv - like eruptive mass loss has been suggested as the possible origin of the csm shells around sn  2005ip @xcite . @xcite",
    "have discussed how binary interaction triggered by pre - sn evolution might instigate lbv - like mass loss through a rapid onset of common - envelope evolution . recalling that lbvs are",
    "a phenomenological class and binary interaction is a physical mechanism , these might be two names for the same phenomenon . some current ideas for lbvs do favour binary interaction as a necessary ingredient in their evolution @xcite .",
    "a drop in pre - shock density followed immediately by an increase in density , as indicated by the h@xmath0 fluctuation of sn  2005ip , might also result from a temporary increase in wind speed that swept material into a thinner shell .",
    "thus , variations in wind speed , as opposed to just wind mass - loss rate , might also give rise to such structures .",
    "wind speeds could vary significantly if the progenitor experienced a blue loop on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , for example .",
    "perhaps the common assumption of ballistic speeds is naive , but nevertheless , this material must be far from the star and quite old compared to the csm overtaken by normal sne  iin during their early bright phases .",
    "another puzzling aspect of sn  2005ip s late - time behaviour concerns its x - ray emission . in 20132014 , analysis of x - rays from sn  2005ip @xcite indicated a drop in both the x - ray flux and the absorbing neutral h column density ( @xmath14 ) along our line of sight ( reaching the expected galactic line - of - sight value by the last epoch ) .",
    "this prompted @xcite to suggest that sn  2005ip s blast wave had reached the outer boundary of the dense shell .",
    "however , the similarity to sn  1988z ( which continued unabated for another decade after this epoch ) , the recent resurgence in h@xmath0 emission from sn  2005ip , and strong radio and x - ray emission , indicate that its csm interaction is not yet going away . in that case , how should we reconcile the observed drop in @xmath14 ?",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that the outer rsg wind is ionized by the luminosity from csm interaction , but found the ionization to be insufficient for expected shock parameters .",
    "however , they did not discuss the possibility of external influences on the rsg wind , and interpreted the drop in density as a shell resulting from a past lbv - like eruption , as noted above .",
    "( they also noted that a change in the degree of clumping might explain the drop in @xmath14 . )",
    "an alternative explanation for the origin of a sudden jump in density at a large radius may be an otherwise normal steady wind that becomes confined by external pressure at large radii @xcite . if the progenitor was indeed a more massive star ( above 1820m@xmath3 ) so that it was an o - type star when on the main sequence , then its hot shocked main - sequence wind will provide an external pressure that might decelerate the rsg wind and confine it to a thin shell .",
    "( if the progenitor has similarly massive o - type neighbours in a young stellar cluster , the hot interior of the h  ii region might create the required external pressure and ionization . ) @xcite have discussed the interesting possibility that some sne  iin may arise from the interaction between the sn shock and this type of externally confined , thin neutral shell . in practice",
    ", this may be quite rare : most normal rsg progenitors are at relatively low initial masses ( i.e. , 1015m@xmath3 ) , which means that they were not o - type stars on the main - sequence , and they reach the rsg phase long after associated o - type stars have died .",
    "on the other hand , more - massive rsgs that die sooner have much higher wind momentum in the rsg phase than assumed in the models , so it remains unclear if normal rsg winds are likely to yield sne  iin through this process .",
    "although this scenario was proposed as a way to explain sne  iin without appealing to eruptive pre - sn mass loss , it may also provide a way for an interacting sn to be `` rejuvenated '' in its old age , since the stalled shell is denser than a freely expanding wind .",
    "@xcite estimate that such a shell can have its density enhanced by a factor of 80 , and may contain a significant fraction ( perhaps a third ) of the total mass lost during the rsg phase .",
    "their models demonstrate that a sn can show a bolometric luminosity spike at very late times from such a collision . in this case",
    "it is difficult to estimate the age of the shell , since its expansion may have stalled , and its radius depends on the external pressure as much as on the momentum of the rsg wind .",
    "future monitoring of sn  2005ip may help to test this hypothesis , as the shock continues to make its way through this dense neutral shell and out into the ionized portion of the rsg wind , or if sn  2005ip resumes a very slow decline as sn  1988z did .",
    "also , higher - resolution spectra may be able to place tighter constraints on the pre - shock csm expansion speed , since the narrow components are unresolved in our moderate - resolution spectra presented here .",
    "regardless of the true explanation for the density fluctuation in sn  2005ip s outer csm , it is useful to realize that mass - loss rates this high ( several times @xmath56 to @xmath12m@xmath3yr@xmath11 or more ) are quite extreme , and do not correspond to normal rsgs like betelgeuse , where the wind is two orders of magnitude less dense @xcite .",
    "the cool evolved stars with winds this dense are rare ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview of mass - loss rates ) , corresponding to the most luminous and extreme rsgs that are enshrouded by their own dusty winds , like vy  cma , nml  cyg , s  per , etc . , or to self - enshrouded super - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . in the cases of sn  1988z and sn  2005ip , however ,",
    "the very large csm mass needed for their sustained high - luminosity csm interaction has been estimated as 10m@xmath3 or more .",
    "this confidently rules out super - agb stars ( total mass including a neutron star of only @xmath96m@xmath3 ) as their possible progenitors .",
    "this would be unlikely anyway , as these super - agb stars that may undergo o - ne - mg core collapse in an electron - capture event are expected to produce a low sn kinetic energy of @xmath97 ergs @xcite .",
    "thus , electron - capture sne that produce sne  iin through interaction may be expected to fade quickly ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sn  1988z was hyperenergetic ; up to day 3000 , @xcite estimate a total radiated energy for sn  1988z of @xmath98erg ( model - dependent @xmath99 ) , and at least @xmath100erg ( observed @xmath101 ) .",
    "sn  2005ip appears very similar in many respects , and is even more luminous and slower to decline in x - rays .",
    "the extreme rsgs mentioned have initial masses of order 2535m@xmath3 , higher than normal unobscured rsgs , with more tightly bound cores that may require more energetic explosions than normal sne  ii - p .",
    "this reinforces earlier suggestions that these extreme rsgs ( as opposed to normal rsgs ) are the likely progenitors of some sne  iin , including long - lived sn  1988z - like events @xcite .",
    "more massive lbv stars may also be able to supply the required amount of csm mass @xcite .",
    "however , the steady late - time decline over decades in the case of sn  1988z argues in favour of a freely expanding , slow , and sustained dense rsg wind , rather than the sporadic eruptive mass loss characteristic of lbvs . for sn  2005ip , future observations of its continuing evolution through the extended csm may help us choose more confidently between an extreme rsg  perhaps exposed to external ionizing radiation from its environment  or an eruptive progenitor . in any case",
    ", the strong variability in h@xmath0 around day 3500 in sn  2005ip has not been seen so clearly before at such late times in sne  iin , and suggests that similar late - time observations of other objects can provide important constraints on the variability in their pre - sn mass loss .",
    "strong and variable mass loss of the type seen here occurring 1000yr before death presents a challenge for models of pre - sn evolution .",
    "once we have a larger number of known sne  iin with such enduring strong csm interaction , it would be interesting to investigate their statistical proximity to h  ii regions as compared to other populations of sne .",

    "<S> supernova ( sn ) 2005ip was a type  iin event notable for its sustained strong interaction with circumstellar material ( csm ) , coronal emission lines , and infrared ( ir ) excess , interpreted as shock interaction with the very dense and clumpy wind of an extreme red supergiant . </S>",

    "<S> we interpret this h@xmath0 variability as ejecta crashing into a dense shell located @xmath1pc from the star , which may be the same shell that caused the ir echo at earlier epochs . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme h@xmath0 luminosities in sn  2005ip and sn  1988z are still dominated by the forward shock at 10 yr post - explosion , whereas sn  1993j and sn  1998s are dominated by the reverse shock at a similar age . </S>",
    "<S> continuous strong csm interaction in sne  2005ip and 1988z is indicative of enhanced mass loss for @xmath2yr before core collapse , longer than ne , o , or si burning phases . </S>",
