    "the reheating @xcite is a hypothetical process in which the inflaton field @xcite is converted into the standard model particles .",
    "the mechanism of reheating is usually assumed to be a parametric production of particles @xcite . however , the considerations are purely speculative due to the lack of any possible empirical verification of the reheating phase . up to now , only some weak constrains on the basic parameters of reheating are available . in particular , the reheating temperature @xmath0 can be constrained from the both sides . from bottom",
    "the constraint is given by the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , namely @xmath4 mev @xcite . from the top",
    ", the constraint comes from the energy scale at the end of inflation @xmath5 gev .",
    "roughly 18 orders of magnitude remain to place the reheating temperature somewhere between .",
    "worse , there is no observational window available at these energy scales .",
    "such a window exists however at the energies of inflation .",
    "it is because the perturbations created during the inflation can be studied by its impact on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and subsequently by the large scale structures ( lss ) .",
    "the method of constraining the reheating phase indirectly by the inflationary observational window was recently studied in ref .",
    "it was shown that it leads to the lower constraint on the reheating temperature @xmath6 tev .    in this paper",
    ", we present an alternative method which can be used to fix at least some details of reheating based on observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . in comparison with the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , it will be possible not only to put a constraint on @xmath0 , but just fix its value .",
    "the idea of the method was sketched in ref .",
    "it bases on the fact that the total increase of the scale factor from the observed part of inflation till now can be determined from the cmb .",
    "the number of @xmath7-foldings from the observed part of inflation till its end can be determined too .",
    "based on this , the @xmath7-folding number from the end of inflation till the recombination can be found . as we show ,",
    "this can be used to determinate the reheating temperature . for simplicity , we assume the slow - roll inflation ( described by a massive inflaton field ) , which is in good agreement with the cmb observations .",
    "after inflation , the inflaton field undergoes coherent oscillations at the bottom of a potential well .",
    "the reheating takes place when the hubble parameter @xmath8 falls to the value of the inflaton decay rate @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the reheating is instantaneous .",
    "after reheating , the standard radiation phase takes place .",
    "the evolution of radiation is assumed to be adiabatic . during the reheating ,",
    "the effective number of relativistic species produced is given by @xmath1 .",
    "the decay rate of the inflaton field can be related with the remaining two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 by the friedmann equation as follows @xmath10 where @xmath11 gev .",
    "therefore , only two from the parameters of reheating @xmath12 are independent . in this paper , we show that the reheating temperature can be determined independently on the remaining two parameters . up to now , the constraints on @xmath0 were dependent on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the equation derived in this paper , the @xmath1 factors surprisingly cancel out .",
    "having @xmath0 , the decay rate @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of @xmath1 only .",
    "the considerations presented in this paper are restricted to the simplest setup in order to capture the essence of the method .",
    "however , extension to the different inflationary scenarios and to the more detailed models of reheating can be done straightforwardly .",
    "the main idea of the method can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ hubble ] .    , where @xmath13.,width=264 ]    in this figure we schematically present evolution of the hubble radius @xmath14 , together with the evolution of an arbitrary physical length scale @xmath15 .",
    "the present value of this length scale is equal to @xmath16 , what we call the _",
    "pivot scale_. the following values of the scale factor were distinguished : + @xmath17  the present value of the scale factor , we set @xmath18 for convenience .",
    "@xmath19  the scale factor at the end of the radiation era .",
    "later , we set this to be a scale factor at the recombination which takes place soon after the end of the radiation era .",
    "@xmath20  the scale factor at which the instantaneous reheating takes place ( beginning of the radiation era ) .",
    "@xmath21  the scale factor at the end of inflation .",
    "the inflation field starts to oscillate .",
    "@xmath22  the scale factor at which the length scale of the present value @xmath16 crossed the hubble radius during inflation .",
    "+ the total increase of the scale factor from @xmath22 to @xmath17 will be of particular importance .",
    "we call it @xmath23 , which can be expressed as follows @xmath24 so , if we know durations of the four stages between the @xmath22 and @xmath17 , the @xmath23 can be determined",
    ". this is , however , practically impossible to obtain because we do not know details of the intermediate periods as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "hopefully , there is an alternative method to determinate @xmath23 , which can be used to put constraints on @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this method bases on the observation of the cmb radiation .",
    "in particular , on the measurements of the scalar power spectrum .",
    "the form of this spectrum is parameterized by the function @xmath27 the @xmath28 is an amplitude and @xmath29 is a spectral index of the scalar perturbations .",
    "the @xmath30 is some arbitrary fixed scale called _",
    "pivot number_. we can relate it to the pivot scale @xmath16 introduced earlier by @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , the wmap collaboration choice is @xmath32 ( we also use this choice in this paper ) . for this value , the seven years of observations made by the wmap satellite",
    "give the following values of the amplitude and spectral index of the scalar perturbations @xcite @xmath33 on the other hand , the well known prediction of the slow - roll inflation is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the so - called slow - roll parameter equal to @xmath36 for the considered massive slow - roll inflation @xmath37 .",
    "let us now consider the power spectrum at the length scale @xmath16 which corresponds to the pivot number @xmath30 . from observation , an amplitude of the scalar perturbations at this scale is equal to @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "this amplitude is formed when @xmath39 .",

    "we have used relation @xmath44 , together with @xmath39 at the horizon crossing .",

    "@xmath40 , so @xmath48 expressing the @xmath35 from @xmath37 , we find @xmath49 the essential conclusion derived from this equation is that : _ based on the cmb observations , one can determinate the total increase of the scale factor from the observed moment of inflation till now . _ in principle , from the wmap 7 observations we determinate @xmath50",
    "the increase of a scale factor during the part of inflation from @xmath42 to @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath7-folding number , which can be expressed as follows @xmath54 we have used here @xmath55 and defined @xmath56 . in particular , based on the wmap 7 data one can find @xmath57 .",
    "the uncertainty is high because of the strong sensitivity on the uncertainty of the spectral index @xmath29 .",
    "this will later propagate to the uncertainty of the reheating temperature . as we show in sec .",
    "[ forecasting ] , the uncertainty of @xmath53 can be significantly reduced with the future cmb experiments .    during the slow - roll inflation , evolution of the inflaton field @xmath58",
    "is well approximated by @xmath59 from comparison with the numerical results , it can be seen that this approximation holds till the end of inflation , when @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the kinetic term @xmath61 is approximately constant during the inflation .",
    "this contribution to the total energy density is , however , dominated by the potential part during the slow - roll inflation . at the end of inflation",
    ", the contribution from the potential part falls to zero ( @xmath62 ) , and the kinetic term dominates .",
    "one can therefore estimate that , at the end of inflation , the energy density is given by @xmath63 a validity of this approximation was confirmed by the numerical computations .",
    "after inflation , the field starts to oscillate at the bottom of the potential well . during this evolution , the energy density drops as in the matter dominated universe @xcite @xmath64 this evolution holds till @xmath65 , when @xmath66 and the reheating takes place .",
    "then , the energy density @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the number of ultrarelativistic degrees of freedom generated during the reheating , where @xmath69 is defined as follows @xmath70 in particular , for glashow - weinberg - salam ( gws ) model @xmath71 , we have @xmath72",
    ". therefore one may expect that @xmath73 if the temperature of reheating is greater than the electroweak energy scale , @xmath74 gev .    based on ( [ rhoaco ] )",

    "however , before we proceed to this issue we can see what we already can say about the reheating temperature .",
    "let us notice that the following condition @xmath77 must be fulfilled .",
    "energy scale of reheating can not be higher than energy at the end of inflation . in order to use this constraint one",
    "has to firstly determinate inflaton mass in eq .",
    "( [ rhoa3 ] ) .",
    "it can be done by noticing that the friedmann equation reduces to @xmath78 in the slow - roll regime ( @xmath79 ) . based on this and condition @xmath40 , together with @xmath37",

    "this constraint excludes another part of the parameter space .",
    "this was represented in fig .",
    "[ trh1 ] as the shadowed region constrained by the vertical line . based on the above constraints , one can conclude that @xmath86 this corresponds to the inflationary bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "after reheating , the universe is filled by the relativistic plasma .",
    "expansion of this relativistic gas is assumed to be adiabatic and the masses of particles are neglected .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is valid until the entropy transfer between the radiation and other components can be neglected . in turn",
    ", this second approximation is valid if the temperature is much higher than the masses of the particles .",
    "then , @xmath87 , which implies @xmath88 const , where the entropy density @xmath89 of radiation is given by @xmath90 based on this one can derive expression on the increase of the scale factor from reheating till the recombination @xmath91 we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 is equal to the recombination temperature @xmath94 . during recombination @xmath95 and",
    "during reheating @xmath96 , therefore @xmath97 finally , increase of the scale factor from recombination till now is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the recombination redshift which can be determined from the cmb observations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an intermediate stage other than recombination can be used here . in particular , the equilibrium point ( end of the radiation epoch , where @xmath100 ) can be chosen .",
    "the corresponding value of redshift can be also determined from the cmb observations .    at this point , we have all required to find the expression on @xmath0 .",
    "we have found all @xmath101 and @xmath23 . based on ( [ dtoddef ] )",
    ", the following relation is fulfilled @xmath102 inserting ( [ d3 ] ) , ( [ d2 ] ) , ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d0 ] ) we obtain @xmath103 where we have used @xmath104 .",
    "the important observation is that @xmath1 factors cancel out .",
    "this is crucial , because the expression on @xmath0 will be free from the dependence on the unknown @xmath1 parameter . with use of ( [ dtotexpr ] ) , ( [ expnobs ] ) and ( [ mexpr ] )",
    ", the above equation can be rewritten into the following form @xmath105 this equation is a main result of this paper .",

    "( [ trheq ] ) to the practical form @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ trh2 ] we show relation ( [ trhfinal ] ) as a function of the spectral index @xmath29 .",
    "we also mark the regions excluded from the inflationary constraint and the bbn constraint .     with @xmath109 .",
    "dashed lines corresponds to @xmath110 , taken from the wmap 7 observations , what leads to @xmath111 .",
    "the shadowed regions are excluded by the inflationary and bbn constraints.,width=302 ]    for the data from the wmap 7 observations , eq .",
    "( [ trhfinal ] ) leads to @xmath112 the relative uncertainty of this result is @xmath113 here a first order taylor expansion was applied when calculating propagation of uncertainties : @xmath114 however , due to the strong ( exponential ) dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath29 , the applied linear approximation may turn out to be insufficient .",
    "therefore , one can expect greater uncertainty of @xmath0 than obtained here .",
    "future studies need to address this issue .",
    "the high relative uncertainty ( [ unctrh ] ) is mainly a result of the weakly determined value of @xmath53 , which is a function of @xmath29 . in the next section",
    ", we will examine how this uncertainty can be reduced with the future cmb experiments .    as it was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , if @xmath115 , then it may be possible to measure @xmath0 with the planned space - based laser interferometer experiments such as the big bang observer .",
    "the value @xmath111 obtained here fulfills this condition .",
    "our prediction has therefore chance to be verified in future .",
    "furthermore , based on eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , one can express the inflaton decay rate @xmath9 in terms of @xmath1 : @xmath116 where the previously derived value of @xmath0 was used .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath117 , which comes from the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "the @xmath118 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "with use of the inflaton mass found earlier we find @xmath119 based on this result , one can deduce that the inflaton decays into the very light particles comparing with its mass .",
    "this is also the reason why the reheating takes place at the relatively low energies .",
    "it becomes unstable only when the sufficiently low energies are reached . however , the origin of this low vale of decay rate @xmath9 can not be understood without a deeper understanding of the inflationary cosmology .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , the value of @xmath0 is strongly dependent on @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the method presented can be used effectively only if the value of @xmath29 is determined with high precision .",
    "the value of @xmath29 from the wmap 7 observations is not determined sufficiently precise to obtain a strong prediction concerning the reheating temperature .",
    "however , it may change if the new observational data will be available . in this section ,",
    "we predict how the uncertainty on @xmath0 will be reduced with the future cmb experiments .",
    "in particular , we consider the planck satellite @xcite experiment which is currently on the stage of collecting data .",
    "we consider the actpol @xcite ground - based experiment which is under construction at present .",
    "we also consider the planned cmbpol @xcite satellite experiment .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath0 comes mainly from @xmath29 , therefore , in the considerations we fix the value of @xmath28 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the expected uncertainties of @xmath29 from the mentioned cmb experiments are the following @xmath120 based on this , let us first see the resulting uncertainties of the @xmath7-folding number @xmath53 .",
    "we find @xmath121 this significant reduction of the uncertainty of @xmath53 ( with respect to the wmap 7 results ) will be crucial for determining the reheating temperature . based on ( [ trhfinal ] ) with ( [ errors ] ) , we forecast @xmath122 here , the values of the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath28 were set to be those obtained from the wmap 7 observations .    in order to have @xmath123 smaller than unity , the uncertainty of @xmath29 should be reduced by 2 orders of magnitude with respect to the wmap 7 results . at present",
    ", there is however no experiment planned to reach such sensitivity",
    ". the uncertainty may be nevertheless additionally reduced by combining data from the different available experiments .",
    "this is possible because of the angular scale dependent sensitivity of the cmb experiments . in particular",
    ", the ground - based experiments can provide much better data of the cmb polarization at the small angular scales ( high multipoles ) than the space - based experiments can .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a new method of constraining the reheating phase after inflation .",
    "the method bases on the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation . in particular , the fact that the total increase of the scale factor from the observed part of inflation till now can be determined is used . based on this ,",
    "we have found the expression on the reheating temperature .",
    "the expression is free from the dependence on the unknown @xmath1 parameter . with use of the wmap 7 results , we have determined @xmath124 tev .",
    "the relative uncertainty of this result is equal to @xmath125 .",
    "this high uncertainty can be , however , significantly reduced with the future cmb data .",
    "one can expect the reheating temperature to be quite precisely determined ( reaching @xmath126 ) within the present decade .",
    "the value of reheating temperature determined in this paper is consistent with the known bounds , in particular , with the lower bound @xmath6 tev recently found in ref .",
    "it is also interesting to note that within the supersymmetric extension of the standard model , the upper bound on the reheating temperature exists @xmath127 tev ( see refs .",
    "our result is also in agreement within this condition .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the low value of the reheating temperature , as determined here , can have interesting implications on the phenomenology of primordial black holes @xcite .",
