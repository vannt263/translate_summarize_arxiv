    "galaxy clustering can be described assuming that galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "recently , the halo model for gravitational clustering @xcite has been revived in cosmology as an attempt to provide an accurate picture of gravitational clustering in the non - linear regime as seen by high - resolution n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "halo model provides a simple prescription for the analytic computation of n - point correlation functions which are the most widely used statistics for gravitational clustering ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , @xcite suggested that the power spectrum of dark matter and galaxies are consistent with this approach , whereas @xcite reached similar conclusions using mock catalogs .",
    "@xcite derived predictions for the power spectrum , bispectrum and its fourier counterparts , the two and three - point correlation functions , that were found to be in agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter sshj ) , discussed the halo model predictions for the power spectrum , and bispectrum , as well as the higher - order cumulants , @xmath1 , and concluded that dark matter clustering in the halo model is in good agreement with measurements from n - body simulations on large scales ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "other developments have focused on describing galaxy bias using the so - called halo occupation distribution , a prescription of filling halos with galaxies in a stochastic fashion @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have thoroughly explored halo model predictions for the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf hereafter ) of dark matter and galaxies .",
    "they concluded that halo model predictions for the dark matter described adequately only certain triangle configurations .",
    "they fail to match simulations for triangles with side length @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite investigated the two- and three - point functions and compared analytic results to dark matter simulations and galaxy clustering observations from the 2df .",
    "they claim their predictions closely reproduce numerical results and observations .    in this paper",

    "in particular , our principal aim is to carry out a detailed comparison of halo model predictions with measurements in high resolution simulations to test the validity of the model and constrain halo model parameters .",
    "the present analysis differs from previous work in the literature in several ways :    *   we present new technology to perform the necessary integrals using multipole expansion , in particular the dimension of the integrals is significantly reduced in our prescription . * for the first time , we test the validity of the halo model against n - body simulations simultaneously in real and fourier space , at the two and three - point level . *",
    "we constrain halo parameters in a self - consistent fashion : all statistics are predicted from halo model parameters . in particular , we do not use the @xcite as an ingredient of the model , which has become common usage when constraining bias from observational data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show that using the halo model in a self - consistent way provides a good fit to n - body simulations , provided one leaves the halo boundary as a free parameter , and large - mass haloes , not present in simulations , are removed from the mass function accordingly .",
    "*   we extend our analysis for the recently proposed multipole expansion of three - point statistics , which expresses rotation invariance naturally .",
    "this allows the compression three - point statistics into a few multipoles even in the non - linear regime .",
    "this is especially convenient for constraining non - gaussianity from gravitational clustering .",
    "according to the halo model picture , the non - linearly evolved dark matter distribution is described in terms of the clustering properties dark haloes , quasi - equilibrium objects formed by gravitational collapse , ( see * ? ? ? * for a review and references therein ) . in this",
    "context , correlation functions are decomposed into contributions arising from correlations among particles inhabiting dark - matter haloes . for convenience throughout this paper we shall closely follow sshj to describe the statistics of gravitational clustering within the halo model .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that dark haloes have a universal profile @xcite . here",
    "we shall adopt the nfw profile , ( r ) = ^3 and its fourier transform , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the zeroth - order spherical bessel function , takes the form ( see sshj ) , ( k , y ) = f with @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the concentration parameter , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the sine and cosine integral functions .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath12 , is the characteristic scale which separates the inner @xmath13 from the outer @xmath14 behavior of the profile . above",
    "we have assumed that the halo profile is truncated at @xmath12 , an assumption that shall be relaxed in order to match clustering measurements in n - body simulations ( see  [ sec : n - body ] ) .",
    "the concentration parameter is not well constrained from simulations and we adopt the standard halo parametrization with halo mass c(m ) = c_0 ( ) ^- [ eq : cpar ] @xmath15 sets the non - linearity scale @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the linear rms mass fluctuation and @xmath18 is the linear overdensity required for spherical collapse",
    ". we shall assume the values suggested by numerical simulations @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite , but have checked that changing halo concentration parameters by as much as 50 % does not affect significantly our predictions within the range of scales probed by our simulations .      a basic ingredient of the halo model is the mass function , @xmath21 , which describes how many objects of mass in the range @xmath22 and @xmath23 end up collapsing to form bound structures .",
    "here we use the extension of the press - schechter formalism provided by @xcite that accurately describes n - body results @xcite : n(m ) m dm = | n ( ) = | a   ( 1+g()^-p ) ( -g()/2 ) with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the lagrangian radius , and @xmath32 is the non - linear ( lagrangian ) scale , where @xmath33 for @xmath34 cosmologies , respectively .",
    "halo correlations can be included in the model by assuming a biasing prescription between the halo and the underlying mass distribution .",
    "we follow the approach introduced by @xcite in the context of the spherical collapse model , and adopt the fitting formula given by @xcite : b ( ) = 1 + + and we neglect quadratic and higher - order biasing terms .",
    "we note that a non - vanishing quadratic bias only affects the three - point statistics ( or higher orders ) on large scales and we have checked that its contribution is a few per cent at most .",
    "halo model statistics are particularly simple to formulate in fourier space .",
    "complications arising from convolutions of halo profiles become simple products in transform space .    according to the halo model approach ,",
    "the non - linear power spectrum of the mass fluctuations is the result of two independent contributions : one coming from the single halo profile auto - correlation that dominates on small - scales and another one given by the correlation among dark matter particles in different halos that accounts for the large - scale clustering .",
    "this way we can write , p(k ) = ^2  p_l(k)+ i_02(k , k ) where , i_ij(k_1,,k_j ) = n(y ) b_i(y)^j-1 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 as we neglect quadratic and higher - order biasing terms , and @xmath39 is the linear power spectrum , for which we assume the @xcite parametrization .",

    "the bispectrum , @xmath42 , can be expressed as a sum of three - point correlations among mass particles residing in one , two , and three haloes , respectively : b_123 = b^pt_123 + \\{i_11(k_1)i_12(k_2,k_3)p_l(k_1 ) + perm(1,2,3 ) } + i_03(k_1,k_2,k_3 ) where @xmath43 denotes the bispectrum from second order perturbation theory ( pt ) . by design ,",
    "halo model recovers weakly non - linear theory predictions on large scales , since @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , or equivalently , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",

    ", @xmath49 is a complex object : @xcite have shown that the evaluation of the two- and three - halo terms in real space involves eight- and twelve - dimensional integrals , respectively ; this is untractable .",
    "they reduce the dimensionality of the integrals to two by switching to fourier - space and taking a number of approximations in the corresponding kernels .",
    "our approach is significantly different in that , although we also use fourier - space formalism , we further decompose correlation functions into harmonic multipoles .",
    "this greatly simplifies the exact analytic expressions , therefore we do not need to take the approximations used by @xcite for the 2- and 3-halo terms .",
    "we note that , for the 1-halo term , their estimator is expressed as a four dimensional integration and it is exact .",
    "the only approximation we take is that we use a finite number of multipoles .",
    "we will see that this is an excellent approximation , except for degenerate ( isosceles ) triangles , where the amplitude of the harmonic coefficients decrease slowly with multipole order . in our formalism , the 3pcf can be expressed as a two - dimensional hankel transform of the bispectrum , for each harmonic multipole @xcite : ( r_1,r_2 , ) = _ _ ( r_1,r_2 )  p _ ( ) [ eq : zeta ] where @xmath50 is the angle between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the harmonic 3pcf , _ ( r_1,r_2 )",

[ eq : qk ] pt and the stable clustering hypothesis predict them to be weakly dependent of scale in the quasi - linear and non - linear regimes , respectively . similar to eq([eq : bl ] ) , it is convenient to decompose the reduced 3pcf , @xmath60 , in its harmonic multipoles by taking its legendre transform , q _ ( r_1,r_2)= 2_-1 ^ 1 d ( )  q(r_1,r_2 , )  p _ ( ) [ eq : ql ] where @xmath50 is the angle between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "analogous expressions can be written for the harmonic multipoles of the reduced bispectrum .",
    "since the bispectrum itself is obtained by performing a one - dimensional integration of the halo correlations over the mass function , in order to compute the three - point function multipoles @xmath63 , as given by eq(@xmath64 ) , four - dimensional integrals are required for each @xmath54 . figure [ fig : q_lterms ] shows how the 3pcf in the non - linear regime can be efficiently reconstructed from its lowest harmonic multipoles . in particular , for the isosceles triangle with side length @xmath65 , only three harmonics contribute significantly to the 3pcf .",
    "the monopole essentially determines the amplitude , the ( negative ) quadrupole and , to a lesser extent , the octopole shape the configuration dependence ( see top left and middle panels ) .",
    "thus the full configuration dependence of the 3pcf can be reconstructed from these three harmonics ( see top right panel ) to an excellent approximation . only collinear configurations , @xmath66 have ( increasingly smaller ) contributions from higher order terms .",
    "similarly , the triangles with @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are shaped by the quadrupole and therefore , the configuration dependence is encoded in this single harmonic to a large extent ( see lower panels ) .",

    "as we shall show below ( see  [ sec : n - body ] ) , in general , _ only the lowest multipoles are non - zero and thus full configuration dependence of the non - linear cosmological 3pcf can be compressed in a few numbers . _ thus using the multipole expansion greatly reduces the problem of constraining non - gaussianity from gravitational clustering .",

    "the original virgo simulation has @xmath74 particles in a box - size of @xmath75mpc , mass resolution of @xmath76 and softening length @xmath77kpc , and a larger box ( vls ) simulation @xmath78mpc that contains @xmath79 particles , same mass resolution than the original virgo simulation and @xmath80kpc .",
    "these simulations have been gravitationally evolved using a p3 m code @xcite .",

    "the large box simulation is cut into eight independent sub - volumes ( octants ) of half box size and measured separately .",
    "mean values are obtained by averaging these eight sub - volumes and the orginal virgo simulation .",
    "errorbars are simply computed from the dispersion over sub - volumes .",
    "we note that this error estimate might underestimate _ true _ errors since sub - volumes are somewhat correlated .",
    "however , for the small scales analyzed in this paper , our sub - samples are effectively independent .",
    "our approach is to discuss halo model predictions for a _ fiducial _ model that provides a good fit to the 2-point statistics ( power spectrum and 2pcf ) measured in the simulations .",
    "then we explore systematically the ability of such a model of describing 3-point statistics in n - body experiments .",
    "we set cosmological parameters to match those of our simulations and the halo concentration parameter is set to @xmath19 and @xmath20 in eq(@xmath82 ) , as in sshj .",
    "we have verified that changing the amplitude and slope of the concentration parameter within a reasonable range ( by a factor @xmath83 ) has a negligible effect on the 2pcf and 3pcf for @xmath84 , or @xmath85 ( see also fig.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore we fix this parameter to its fiducial values to simplify further studies .",
    "basic halo model parameters yield a 2pcf that does not fit well our n - body results .",
    "this is clearly seen in figs.@xmath86-@xmath87 , especially for scales , @xmath88 . to improve the precision , we introduce standard `` tweaks '' of the basic set of ingredients of the model .",
    "the assumption that the halo boundary ( the radius up to which halo mass is encompassed ) is exactly given by the virial radius is in fact quite arbitrary . treating this as an additional free parameter to the 1-halo terms in the 2pcf and 3pcf improves the _ transition scales _ , @xmath89 , between linear ( or quasi - linear ) to fully non - linear scales ( see figs.@xmath86 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "fig.@xmath90 shows that a halo boundary beyond the virial radius increases the 2pcf on small scales and reduces the `` bump '' in the reduced bispectrum for equilateral triangles @xmath91 .",
    "setting the boundary to the fiducial value , @xmath92 , yields good agreement both with the 2pcf and 3pcf in simulations .",
    "in particular , for the 2pcf , the agreement with n - body is comparable to the fitting function provided by smith et al.(2003 ) .",
    "however , on large scales , halo model tends to slightly overpredict simulations , whereas smith et al .",
    "slightly underpredicts them .",
    "similarly , fig.@xmath93 shows that our fiducial model provides a good fit to the matter power spectrum measured in our n - body simulations .",
    "our results are in full agreement with that of @xcite who also implemented the `` exclusion effect '' .",
    "this excludes correlations between haloes at distances smaller than the sum of their virial radii .",
    "halo exclusion is an inherently real space phenomenon , and it would be difficult , if not impossible , to correctly implement in our fourier - based approach .",
    "we have checked using approximations ( which essentially cut off the two - halo term on small scales ) that halo exclusion plays a subdominant role in describing the 3pcf ( see also fig.8 in * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we try to mimic the finite volume effects affecting n - body simulations by imposing a cut - off in the mass function , excluding haloes of masses @xmath94 .",
    "this has a critical effect on clustering on scales @xmath95 .",
    "we find that imposing no cut - off overpredicts the clustering observed in simulations whereas excluding haloes of @xmath96 results in too low a 2pcf .",
    "this is even more evident in the reduced bispectrum for equilateral triangles @xmath91 ( see fig.@xmath90 ) . our fiducial value @xmath97 reproduces reasonably well simulation results .",
    "this behavior was already observed by sshj and @xcite who found different best - fit values for their smaller - box ( @xmath98 ) simulations . while these works did not discuss the effect of the mass cut - off on the 2pcf , we have made sure that our fiducial choice , motivated by the 3pcf , still reproduces the 2pcf accurately .",
    "the above two extra parameters fix our fiducial model . in",
    "what follows , we shall use it to work out detailed predictions for the 3pcf and its harmonic multipoles @xmath63 ( see eqs(@xmath99 ) and ( @xmath64 ) ) , and compare them to measurements n - body simulations .",
    "fig.@xmath100 displays the reduced bispectrum for several different triangular configurations .",
    "it appears that large scales present a more pronounced configuration dependence than predicted by the three - halo term .",
    "triangles on small - scales are rather flat , except for the `` shoulder '' displayed by the isosceles triangles .",
    "halo model prediction for the reduced 3pcf for equilateral triangles , @xmath101 is in good agreement with n - body results as shown in fig.@xmath102 . on scales",
    "@xmath103 the model slightly overpredicts simulations , similarly to the 2pcf on the same scales ( see fig.@xmath86 and fig.@xmath104 ) .",
    "note that the non - linear halo model converges , albeit slowly , to the pt on large - scales .",
    "fig.@xmath105 displays the configuration dependence of the 3pcf for the _ transition scales _ as predicted by the halo model ( lines ) compared to numerical simulations ( symbols ) .",
    "the agreement between the model and simulations is generally within the errorbars .",
    "moreover , the rich configuration and scale dependence made up by the non - trivial interplay between different halo terms is observed in simulations . this can be considered as the best confirmation that the basic idea of halo models carries over to the three - point function without major modifications .",
    "fig.@xmath106 shows the reduced 3pcf @xmath107 for the same triangles whereas fig.@xmath108 shows an interpolated surface displaying the @xmath109 dependence for the mean values of the n - body for @xmath110 .",
    "note that since @xmath107 is predicted to be of order unity for all configurations , it is more suitable for high - precision comparisons on linear scale plots . on the down side , the complex structure of this ratio statistic combining 2pcf and 3pcf complicates interpretation . in particular , halo model describes the configuration dependence of the reduced 3pcf accurately for @xmath111 , but it becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger scales .",
    "the slight overall amplitude mismatch observed ( see the case for isosceles triangles , @xmath112 , in left column of fig.@xmath106 ) is due to the halo model 2pcf overpredicting simulations .",
    "we have checked that using fitting formula of @xcite for the 2pcf instead of the halo model does not improve the agreement with simulations significantly .",
    "note that for intermediate angles theoretical predictions always agree with the simulations , in line with our earlier results for equilateral triangles ( see fig.@xmath102 ) .",
    "the most visible difference between model and n - body results is the lack of configuration dependence predicted by the halo model on larger scales , @xmath113 .    the multipole expansion of the 3pcf , eq.([eq : zetal ] ) ,",
    "is particularly useful to pinpoint why the halo model fails to reproduce numerical results .",
    "figs.@xmath114-@xmath115 show the 3pcf multipoles for different triangles and scales @xmath116 .",
    "in general , the amplitude of the coefficients falls off rapidly with multipole order .",
    "this makes multipoles especially convenient to compress information in the cosmological 3pcf in the non - linear regime ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "isosceles triangles are exceptional : on small angles the third side of the triangle is very small , which results in a rapid increase .",
    "this can be described in multipole space only with a high number of multipoles ( such as a dirac @xmath117-function would have infinite number of multipoles ) .",
    "the situation worsens towards larger scales , due to even more rapid increase of the 3pcf on small angles .",
    "while this technical deficiency can be overcome by simply smoothing the correlation function over angles ( `` band limiting '' ) , we note that on scales above @xmath118 , where this effect becomes severe , pt becomes more and more accurate , therefore halo models are not necessary for dark matter predictions @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , for @xmath113 , halo model consistently underpredicts the quadrupole moment ( and to a lesser extent , the octopole ) . _",
    "the observed lack of configuration dependence in the halo model with respect to simulations is primarily due to a quadrupole deficit in the prediction _ ( see figs.@xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "this might be caused by the 2-halo term , which shows hardly any variation with angle on large - scales @xmath113 ( see figs.@xmath105 and @xmath106 ) , contrary to what one would expect for halo - halo spatial correlations .",
    "one possible reason for this quadrupole deficit in the two - halo term is that our implementation of the halo model assumes that haloes are spherical , whereas real virialized objects in high - resolution cdm simulations do have a typically asymmetric ( triaxial ) shape ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sshj already pointed out in their bispectrum analysis that relaxing the sphericity hypothesis for halo shapes could bring halo model to a closer agreement with the configuration dependence observed in numerical simulations .",
    "although our analysis suggests a similar conclusion , it is unclear whether one - halo ( as pointed out by sshj ) or rather two - halo terms ( that show a significant lack of configuration dependence at all scales ) should carry the missing quadrupole .    on the other hand halo substructure @xcite could play a significant role on scales comparable to large - cluster sized haloes  @xmath119 .",
    "however , a recent analysis @xcite suggests that substructure tends to attenuate the amplitude of the reduced bispectrum on small scales .",
    "this would render our analytic predictions , at least our fiducial model , in disagreement with n - body measurements ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : qeqk_paper_hb ] and [ fig : qeqk_paper_mc ] )",
    ".    clearly , there are other potential improvements to our implementation of the halo model , most importantly a consistent definition of the mass function for a modified halo boundary ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or allowing for a steeper inner halo profile ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) what could bring model predictions closer to measurements in high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "we plan to address these issues in future work .",
    "the revival of the halo model in recent years has been triggered by the ability of high - resolution n - body simulations to test theoretical predictions with great precision . in this paper",
    "we have presented a detailed comparison of halo model predictions against simulations for the 2pcf and 3pcf in real and fourier space .",
    "our analysis has focused on the transition scales , @xmath120 that connect large ( quasi - linear ) scales , appropriately described by pt , with highly non - linear scales where phenomena such as the stable clustering hypothesis require higher resolution simulations to be accurately tested .",
    "our results show that halo boundary and mass function cut - off have a significant effect on the three - point correlation functions on these transition scales , and thus these statistics can be used to constrain such halo model parameters .",
    "a fiducial model with halo boundary @xmath121 and mass cut - off @xmath122 brings theoretical predictions in close agreement to our simulations .",
    "the success of our fiducial model in explaining non - linear gravitational clustering has been comprehensively demonstrated in fourier space for the power spectrum ( fig.@xmath93 ) , the reduced bispectrum ( figs.@xmath90 and @xmath87 ) , as well as in real space , through the two - point correlation function ( figs.@xmath86 and @xmath104 ) , 3pcf ( fig.@xmath105 ) , and the reduced 3pcf ( figs.@xmath102 , and @xmath106 ) along with its multipole moments ( figs.@xmath114-@xmath115 ) .",
    "halo model predictions are in good agreement with the configuration and scale dependence of the reduced bispectrum at all the scales measured in n - body results , @xmath123 . on the other hand , while the model correctly predicts the amplitudes of the 3pcf on intermediate angles for all the scales tested , it exhibits a lack of configuration dependence that becomes more significant on scales larger than the largest halos seen in simulations @xmath124 .",
    "although the reason for this is not clear , we suggest that non - spherical haloes could produce a more pronounced configuration dependence in theoretical predictions .",
    "this could be realized through the two - halo terms that show a rather flat behavior in the current implementation of the model .",
    "however if the orientation of the two halos is random , the non - sphericity should cancel out .",
    "this issue certainly deserves further attention in future analyses of the dark - matter and galaxy n - point correlation functions .",
    "it is particularly useful to decompose the reduced 3pcf in its harmonic multipoles @xmath125 s , as given by eq([eq : ql ] ) .",
    "we have seen that only the lowest orders have non - zero amplitude and thus the non - linear 3pcf can be compressed in a few numbers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : q_lterms ] ) . furthermore , assuming a model for the halo occupation distribution and an appropriate modeling of redshift distortions , one should be able to formally decompose the 3pcf of galaxies in the exact same way",
    ". in particular , observables such as the harmonic multipoles of the galaxy 3pcf measured in large volume surveys should be largely uncorrelated and approximately gaussian distributed , in a similar way it happens for the angular power spectrum multipoles of the cmb anisotropy @xmath126 .",
    "thus the @xmath125 s must be tightly related to the signal - to - noise eigenmodes of the 3pcf @xcite .",
    "moreover @xcite have shown that the highest signal - to - noise q - eigenmodes measured in mock galaxy catalogs can be efficiently used to recover bias parameters .",
    "it is remarkable that the first three q - eigenmodes have a configuration dependence that is extremely similar to the monopole , dipole and quadrupole terms ( compare their fig.10 with middle panels in fig.[fig : q_lterms ] of this paper ) .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath125 s are indeed closely related to the uncorrelated modes of the galaxy 3pcf and thus they may simplify the procedure of constraining galaxy bias from the 3pcf .",
    "alternatively , the proposed multipole approach can be readily applied to other clustering statistics of the mass density field in the non - linear regime such as the projected mass 3pcf , that is barely affected by redshift distortions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent implementation using fourier series ) , or the 3pcf of the convergence field that probes the lensing potential ( see * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we discuss the accuracy and self - consistency of the halo model description of gravitational clustering in the non - linear regime and constrain halo model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the recently proposed multipole expansion of three point statistics that expresses rotation invariance in the most natural way . </S>",
    "<S> this not only offers technical advantages by reducing the integrals required for the halo model predictions , but amounts to a convenient way of compressing the information contained in the 3pcf . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , with an appropriate choice of the halo boundary and mass function cut - off , halo model predictions are in good agreement with the bispectrum measured in numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the halo model predicts less than the observed configuration dependence of the 3pcf on @xmath0 mpc scales . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is mainly due to quadrupole moment deficit , possibly related to the assumption of spherical halo geometry . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that using its harmonic decomposition , the full configuration dependence of the 3pcf in the non - linear regime can be compressed into just a few numbers , the lowest multipoles . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these multipoles are closely related to the highest signal to noise eigenmodes of the 3pcf </S>",
    "<S> . therefore this estimator may simplify future analyses aimed at constraining cosmological and halo model parameters from observational data . </S>"
