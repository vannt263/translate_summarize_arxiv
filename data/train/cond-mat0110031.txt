    "the characterization of interfaces and of the mechanisms underlying their formation and evolution is a subject of paramount importance for a broad variety of phenomena such as crystal growth , rock fracture , biological growth , vapor deposition , surface erosion by ion sputtering , cluster assembling , etc ... ( @xcite and references therein ) . since the pioneering work of b.b .",
    "mandelbrot , fractal geometry has been widely used as a model to describe these physical systems that are too disordered to be studied with other mathematical tools but that still hold a sort of `` order '' in a scale - invariance sense @xcite . in particular",
    ", the growth of interfaces resulting from the irreversible addition of subunits from outside ( vapor deposition of thin films , low energy cluster beam deposition , etc ... ) shows a typical asymmetric scale invariance , because of the existence of a privileged direction ( e.g. the direction of growth ) @xcite .",
    "these interfaces belong to the class of self - affine fractals and they can be described either by the fractal dimension @xmath0 or by the well - known hurst exponent @xmath1 @xcite . if these systems are the result of a temporally evolving process , they usually show also a time scale - invariance described by the exponent @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "because of the close relationship between the scaling exponent(s ) and the fundamental mechanisms leading to scale invariance , universality classes can be defined @xcite .",
    "an accurate knowledge of @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) is required to identify the universality class of the system and to give a deep insight on the underlying formation processes .",
    "the possibility of characterizing the topography of an interface in a dimension range from the nanometer up to several tens of microns , in a relatively simple and quick way by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite has stimulated an upsurge of experimental report claiming for self - affine structures ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . the abundance of experimental characterization of different systems and the limited sampling capability of the scanning probe microscopies ( spm ) prompted at the attention of many authors the need of an accurate methodological approach to the determination of the exponent @xmath1 and of its error @xcite , realistically considering the consequences of the finite sampling inherent to spm",
    "typical sampling with an afm or a stm is 256 or 512 points per line , for a maximum of 512 lines .",
    "most of the results published in the late eighties and early nineties were based upon 256x256-point data - sheets , or even smaller ones ( see list of references in ref .",
    "commercially available spms offer today a maximum of 512x512-point resolution , and homemade instruments hardly go beyond this value .",
    "many authors have questioned the reliability of the measurement of the hurst exponent from a poorly sampled profile @xcite . in order to quantify the influence of the sampling on the determination of @xmath1 , a numerical analysis can be performed on artificial self - affine profiles , generated with a specific algorithm , with a fixed number of points @xmath3 and known hurst exponent @xmath4 .",
    "the `` true '' exponents ( @xmath4 ) are then compared with the ones measured directly from the generated profiles ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "usually a sensible discrepancy between the measured @xmath5 and the expected @xmath4 is found @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is not uniform but depends on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "as one would expect , the discrepancy is globally dependent on the number @xmath3 and it approaches zero for large values of @xmath3 . in particular , for @xmath6 the sampling effect is of great importance since the discrepancy can be of the order of the exponent itself ( 100% relative error ) @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have reported that even for values of @xmath3 as high as 16384 , the discrepancy is still significant @xcite .",
    "although the problem of sampling has been clearly addressed and discussed , quite surprisingly a systematic analysis of the problem , considering different generation algorithms , is still lacking .",
    "the dependence of the sampling effect on @xmath3 has been investigated @xcite and also many different methods for the measurement of @xmath5 have been considered for different values of @xmath4 in the range @xmath7 $ ] @xcite . however , either only one single generation algorithm has been used @xcite , or the results from different generation algorithms have not been compared @xcite .",
    "we believe that this comparison is of fundamental importance .",
    "indeed profiles from different generation algorithms can be considered as different self - affine objects sampled in @xmath3 points . for a fixed value of @xmath4",
    ", these objects would all have the same fractal dimension if they were sampled with an infinite number of points .",
    "the fundamental question at this point is whether the discrepancy of @xmath5 from @xmath4 , for a finite value of @xmath3 , is the same for every self - affine object ( i.e. for every generation algorithm ) .",
    "only an analysis that considers different self - affine objects has a statistical validity and allows a reliable interpretation of the results . up to now the results obtained in literature from a single generation algorithm",
    "did non allow a discussion of the nature of the aforementioned discrepancy , which has been interpreted as an uncontrollable error affecting the analysis of sampled profiles .",
    "the main conclusion drawn by these authors is the non - reliability of results obtained from profiles with less than 1024 sampling points @xcite .",
    "our aim is to achieve a deeper understanding of the effects of sampling in order to answer the question whether the measurement of the hurst exponent with a poor number of sampling points is reliable or not .",
    "this point is crucial both for future analysis of self - affine profiles and for a correct interpretation of the results already present in literature .    from a more general point of view",
    ", fractality is characterized by the repetition of somehow similar structures at all length scales and can be described in its major properties by a single number : the fractal dimension @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "any finite sampling of a fractal object poses both an upper and a lower cut - off to this scale invariance .",
    "it has been shown that these cut - offs introduce a deviation in @xmath0 and the sampled object has a dimension different from the one of the underlying continuous object @xcite . however , it is still unknown whether the sampling influences in a different way different objects characterized by the same ideal dimension , thus breaking the sort of universality that makes a fractal be identified by its dimension only .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic analysis considering together all the generation algorithms found in literature .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to understand whether the discrepancy of the measured @xmath5 for a fixed @xmath3 and for every generation algorithm is completely random or has a universal dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the latter observation can be interpreted as a reminiscence of the fact that a fractal object is completely characterized by its dimension .",
    "the distinction is of crucial importance because in the case of universal dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath4 , one can empirically correct the discrepancy of the measured exponents from the `` true '' ones .",
    "some authors independently suggested to use directly the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 curves as correction , but they considered only one generation algorithm without discussing the universal character that these curves must have in order to be utilized for any self - affine object @xcite .",
    "conversely , on the basis of our analysis , we will interpret the discrepancy in terms of two distinct contributions : a universal deviation and a random dispersion .",
    "we will propose a powerful method to correct the universal deviation and we will discuss the nature of the dispersion , which is due to both statistical fluctuations and an intrinsic sampling effect .",
    "the latter turns out to be a sort of systematic error that can not be corrected unless one knows the generation algorithm that produced the self - affine object . in the case of generic self - affine profiles which have not been generated by a specific algorithm , such as experimental profiles ,",
    "the above arguments no longer hold . a new procedure to quantify the intrinsic error in the measurement of the hurst exponent of generic self - affine profiles",
    "is thus needed .    on these basis",
    ", we will discuss the effect of sampling on the reliability of the fractal analysis of poorly sampled self - affine profiles , focusing on both the deviation and the dispersion of the measured exponents from the ideal ones , showing that the conclusions drawn by schmittbuhl _",
    "_ that `` _",
    "_ ... a system size less than 1024 can hardly be studied seriously , unless one has some independent way of assessing the self - affine character of the profiles and very large statistical sampling _ _ '' were too restrictive @xcite . moreover ,",
    "we will point out that the estimate of the intrinsic error is essential for a correct classification of a process in terms of universality classes .",
    "in fact , in order to distinguish exponents belonging to different classes , it is necessary to quantify the error on the measurement . up to now , the statistical error or the error of the fit have been used to quantify the error on the measurement of @xmath1 @xcite . both the statistical error and the error of the linear fit can be made very small , if a large number of profiles are averaged . however , if the measurement is likely to be affected by more subtle intrinsic errors , such as the aforementioned dispersion due to the sampling , considering only the statistical error may lead to serious misleading . the intrinsic error in many cases may indeed be much larger than the statistical one .    in the following sections we will present a systematic analysis of synthetic self - affine profiles with the aim of both achieving a deep understanding of the effects of sampling and providing the experimentalists of a reliable tool for the fractal analysis of surfaces and interfaces . to this purpose we have developed a new automated fitting protocol in order to avoid any arbitrariness in the measurement . with this new methodology we will study the effects of sampling , enlightening the main characteristics of the deviation and the dispersion of the measured exponents .",
    "we will present a new powerful method to correct the deviation of @xmath5 and to estimate the error of the measurement .",
    "finally , we will apply our empirical correction procedure to 512-point profiles created with the directed percolation ( dp ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "this system provides a simple benchmark to test our protocol and allows noticing the opportunity of the correction .",
    "self - affine systems occurring in nature are usually profiles or surfaces . in order to measure their hurst exponents the 2 + 1 dimensional case of surfaces",
    "is usually reduced to 1 + 1 dimensions , considering the intersection of the surface with a normal plane",
    ". the particular case of in - plane anisotropy results in a dependence of @xmath1 on the orientation of the plane with respect to the surface @xcite .",
    "once we have scaled down the analysis to 1 + 1 dimensions , the following general properties characterize a self - affine profile .",
    "if @xmath8 is the height of the profile in the position @xmath9 , the orthogonal anisotropy can be expressed by the scaling relationship : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hurst exponent , @xmath12 is a positive scaling factor and the equation holds in a statistical sense @xcite .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath0 of the profile is related to the hurst exponent by the equation @xmath13 while the dimension of the surface is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the lower is @xmath1 , the more space invasive is the surface . in most of the physical self - affine surfaces",
    ", the scale invariance does not extend to all length scales but there is an upper cut - off above which the surface is no longer correlated .",
    "the length at which this cut - off appears is defined as the correlation length @xmath15 @xcite . in the present analysis , we consider only profiles whose correlation length ( expressed in number of points ) is equal to their length @xmath3 . to this purpose",
    "we have carefully studied each generation algorithm in order to grant the condition @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason we were often forced to generate very long profiles and to consider only their central portion @xcite . the usual procedure to measure the hurst exponent of a self - affine profile @xmath8 is to calculate appropriate statistical functions from the whole profile .",
    "these functions of analysis ( afs ) show a typical power law behavior on self - affine profiles : @xmath17=c\\,k^{f(h)}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a constant , @xmath19 is a variable indicating the resolution at which the profile @xmath20 is analyzed ( typically a frequency or a spatial / temporal separation ) , and @xmath21 is a simple function of the hurst exponent @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the power law behavior of the af is then fitted in a log - log plot in order to calculate the exponent @xmath1 . in the analysis of statistical self - affine profiles",
    "there are random fluctuations super - imposed to this power law behavior .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of these fluctuations is scale - dependent , the afs being calculated as averages of statistical quantities at different length scales @xcite . to reduce this noise ,",
    "the average of the afs obtained from @xmath22 independent profiles is usually taken before the execution of the linear fit . however , while small - scale fluctuations are easily smoothed , larger scale fluctuations converge very slowly .",
    "the identification of the linear region in the analysis of the afs is a puzzling point .",
    "windowing saturation is present at length scales comparable with the profile length depending on the nature of the profiles @xcite .",
    "this results in a departure from the power law behavior to a constant value .",
    "moreover , the degradation of the fractality due to the sampling causes a diversion of the afs from their ideal power law behavior .",
    "this produces both a discrepancy of the measured hurst exponent from the ideal value ( a change of the slope in the log - log plot ) and a shortening of the linear region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "average height - height correlation function @xmath23 calculated from @xmath24 profiles of @xmath25 points , generated with the random addition method with hurst exponent @xmath26 .",
    "it is also shown the linear region and the fit obtained with the automated fitting protocol ( afp ) .",
    "one can clearly see the overall curved shape due to the sampling . ]    here , the presence of curved regions is clearly visible .",
    "it can be seen that this anomalous behavior is not localized at length scales close to the length of the profile , but involves also the shortest length scales especially for values of @xmath1 close to zero .",
    "it is important to notice that this effect is not due to experimental conditions , such as the finite size of the spm scanning probe .",
    "thus it is necessary , in particular for small values of @xmath1 , to chose a linear region instead of fitting the whole function .",
    "the methods proposed in the literature to identify the linear region ( e.g. the consecutive slopes method @xcite , correlation index method @xcite , the coefficient of determination method @xcite and the `` fractal measure '' method @xcite ) are usually based on an arbitrary ( human ) choice .",
    "this is particularly delicate since the curvature in the afs can be so small , if compared to the statistical noise , that it is hard to distinguish the correct linear region .",
    "because of this reason , we think that the proposed methods suffer of a high degree of arbitrariness . moreover",
    ", all these methods make no distinction between a straight line with statistical noise and a slightly curved line .    due to the previous arguments and since",
    "no universally accepted fitting procedure is available in literature , we were prompted to develop an automated fitting protocol ( afp ) with two purposes : to reduce as much as possible the effects of the curved regions on the measured exponent , and to define a standard algorithm for the choice of the linear region , eliminating , as much as possible , any arbitrariness .",
    "this is very important for the reliability of the results , in particular for the comparison of different generation algorithms .",
    "moreover , the automation of the fitting procedure is essential to perform a systematic analysis .",
    "in fact , in order to have good statistics , a large number of afs must be calculated and fitted .    in our procedure , that is an implementation of the consecutive slopes algorithm @xcite , the curve to be fitted is divided in many portions of the same length @xmath27 ( in number of points ) and each of them is considered separately .",
    "a linear and a cubic fit are performed on each portion .",
    "comparing the mean distance of the linear fit from the portion to the mean distance of the cubic from the linear fit , we evaluate whether the portion is almost linear with uncorrelated noise or it presents a definite curvature .",
    "obviously , the distinction is not immediate and we have to set a threshold to separate the two cases through a parameter in the fitting procedure .",
    "the use of a parameter is common to other methods ( see for example the coefficient of determination method used in ref .",
    "once the fitting parameter is set , our procedure is able to decide automatically whether the portion is `` curved '' or `` linear '' . only the `` linear '' portions",
    "are then considered .",
    "they undergo a straight - line - fit analysis through which the slopes and their errors are determined .",
    "a distribution of the slopes weighted with the values of the errors is then built ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a ) and its main peak position and width are measured .",
    "we do not consider here the presence of more than one linear region with different slopes .",
    "thus , there is a well - defined main peak in the distribution .",
    "we have extended our procedure also to the case of more than one linear region , but this extension is out of the scopes of this article .",
    "the procedure described above is repeated varying the length @xmath27 of the portions from a minimum value @xmath28 up to the length of the curve .",
    "the results are then shown in a plot of the peak position ( i.e. a slope value ) versus the length of the portion , with the peak widths as error bars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) .",
    "application of the fitting protocol step by step : ( a ) the distribution of the slopes for a single value of the length @xmath27 of the portion ( @xmath29 decades ) and ( b ) the final plot of the slopes ( peak positions ) vs. @xmath27 , with an inset magnification showing the error bars.,title=\"fig : \" ] application of the fitting protocol step by step : ( a ) the distribution of the slopes for a single value of the length @xmath27 of the portion ( @xmath29 decades ) and ( b ) the final plot of the slopes ( peak positions ) vs. @xmath27 , with an inset magnification showing the error bars.,title=\"fig : \" ]    if the analyzed curve presents a linear region , this plot shows a plateau for @xmath27 ranging from @xmath28 to the length of the whole linear region .",
    "this plateau is usually very easy to be identified because of the distinction between linear and curved portions .",
    "in fact , portions of length larger than the length of the whole linear region are considered curved portions and discarded .",
    "thus , the plot usually drops to zero at the end of the plateau .",
    "eventually , through an average and a standard deviation , we obtain the final slope value and its fitting error , while the length of the plateau gives the length of the linear region . in conclusion ,",
    "our afp is able to identify not only the slope of the linear region but also its length .",
    "we have tested our afp before its application to the systematic analysis and we have found that the measured hurst exponent is widely independent of the fitting parameter .",
    "conversely , the length of the linear region strongly depends upon the value of the parameter and must be considered only an internal parameter of the analysis and not a direct measurement of the scale invariance range .",
    "with all the generation algorithms published in literature we have created sampled self - affine profiles with known fractal dimension @xmath13 . we have varied the exponent @xmath1 between 0.1 and 1 and we have focused on the value @xmath30 sampling points ( the best sampling obtainable with most of the spms ) .",
    "we discuss also different values of @xmath3 up to 16384 . because there exists only a few algorithms that generate exactly self - affine profiles , we have used algorithms that generate statistically self - affine profiles , which are more difficult to handle but closer to reproduce natural physical systems .",
    "the algorithms we have used are known in literature as : the random midpoint displacement @xcite , the random addition algorithm @xcite , the fractional brownian motion @xcite , the weierstrass - mandelbrot function @xcite , the inverse fourier transform method @xcite and a variation of the independent cut method @xcite .",

    "[ fig:5 ] clearly shows that the lessening of fractality of a profile is rather a continuous process than a sharp transition : the poorer is the sampling , the worse are the deviation and the dispersion . in figs . 5 and 3 we observe that the lessening of fractality acts in a similar way on profiles generated with different algorithms .",
    "the common trend of the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 curves obtained from different generation algorithms is interpreted as a consequence of the universality of fractal objects .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume the existence for every af of a universal region in the @xmath5-@xmath4 plane containing all the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 plots obtained with every possible generation algorithm .",
    "this region , approximately identifiable with the envelope of the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 plots , has a width that depends on the number of sampling points and approaches the 1-dimensional @xmath56 ideal curve for very large values of @xmath3 .",
    "we expect that , given any continuous self - affine profile with a hurst exponent @xmath4 and given the exponent @xmath5 measured from an @xmath3-point sampling of the continuous profile , the pair ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) belongs to the universal region of the corresponding graph ( specific for every af and number of sampling points @xmath3 ) .",
    "provided a good characterization of the aforementioned regions ( i.e. using as many generation algorithms as possible ) , we can use them to generate calibration graphs for every @xmath3 and af describing the relationship between the measured @xmath5 and the true value @xmath4 .    to produce the calibration graphs we proceed as follows .",
    "first of all , we make two general assumptions in order to take quantitatively into account the problem of measuring the hurst exponent of a sampled profile .",
    "we assume that the @xmath5 values corresponding to the same @xmath4 are normally distributed around a mean @xmath57 , and we assume also that the values obtained with the available generation algorithms are a random sampling of the gaussian distribution .",
    "we then measure the average and the standard deviation of the dispersed @xmath5 values corresponding to each @xmath4 separately .",
    "thus we obtain a sampling of the functions describing the dependence of @xmath57 and @xmath58 from @xmath4 . with an interpolation algorithm using smooth functions",
    ", we derive the curve representing the relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath4 .",
    "we also derive the pair of curves corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath60 vs. @xmath5 which define the @xmath61-th confidence level . for every value of @xmath5 it is possible to find the confidence interval of @xmath4 for any given confidence level .",
    "the resulting graphs for @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "calibration graphs @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 for the methods of analysis used in this article : ( a ) height - height correlation function and ( b ) variable bandwidth with fit subtraction . from the value of the measured exponent",
    ", one can easily extract the corresponding confidence interval of the corrected exponent , as represented graphically in ( a).,title=\"fig : \" ] calibration graphs @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 for the methods of analysis used in this article : ( a ) height - height correlation function and ( b ) variable bandwidth with fit subtraction . from the value of the measured exponent",
    ", one can easily extract the corresponding confidence interval of the corrected exponent , as represented graphically in ( a).,title=\"fig : \" ]    these calibration graphs allow to take into account the deviation and the dispersion due to the sampling .",
    "a similar method has been independently proposed in ref . @xcite even though the analysis was limited to a single generation algorithm and the discussion on the reliability of the calibration regions together with the intrinsic dispersion were completely neglected .    using the calibration graphs it is possible to measure the hurst exponent of poorly sampled profiles correcting for the first time the deviation due to the sampling and providing a reasonable estimate of the error on a confidence level basis .",
    "the quantification of the error is of paramount importance , as pointed out in the introduction , since many authors estimated the error from the precision of the linear fit @xcite or from the standard deviation of the measured exponents @xcite .",
    "our results show that they usually underestimated the true error .",
    "we have applied our procedure to the 1 + 1 dimensional directed percolation ( dp ) model , described by s.v .",
    "this model mimics the paper wetting process by a fluid .",
    "the resulting pinned interface is self - affine with exponent @xmath62 .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath63 , @xmath47 dp profiles with the height - height correlation function ( _ h .- h .",
    "corr _ ) and the variable bandwidth with fit subtraction ( _ vbw _ ) , using the automated fitting protocol to measure the hurst exponents .",
    "the results are shown in the second column of tab . [",
    "tab : dp ] .",
    "we have not calculated the statistical error ( see section [ sec : results&discussion ] ) because it would have been excessively time consuming .",
    "thus , the error shown is simply the error of the fit calculated with the afp .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the measured exponents @xmath64 are significantly lower than the ones predicted by the dp model , suggesting that a correction is needed even in the case of profiles of @xmath47 points , which are widely considered as continuous .",
    "we have then analyzed @xmath65 , @xmath30 profiles extracted from the @xmath47 profiles .",
    "we have applied the correction procedure based on the calibration graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] to the exponents measured with the afp . in the third column of tab .",
    "[ tab : dp ] , the uncorrected measured exponents ( @xmath66 ) are shown .",
    "the error is calculated as the root mean square ( _ rms _ ) value of the statistical error @xmath67 ( evaluated as explained in section [ sec : results&discussion ] ) and the error of the fit calculated with the afp . in the fourth column ,",
    "the confidence intervals corresponding to the @xmath68 probability for the `` true '' exponents are shown ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the results summarized in tab . [ tab : dp ] allow to notice the effectiveness of the calibration graphs in the analysis of self - affine profiles when the effects of sampling are non negligible .",
    "in the example reported here , the poor sampling causes a discrepancy of about @xmath70 between the measured exponents and the theoretical one for dp profiles . after the correction with the calibration graphs ,",
    "the expected value @xmath71 is consistent with the confidence intervals of the three afs .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic error due to the dispersion ( about half the width of the confidence interval ) turns out to be usually one order of magnitude larger than the aforementioned _ rms _ error .    in conclusion ,",
    "our calibration graphs have allowed to correct the deviation and to quantify the intrinsic error of the hurst exponent of poorly sampled ( @xmath30 ) dp profiles .",
    "we have carried out a systematic analysis in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the effects of sampling on the measurement of the hurst exponent of self - affine profiles .",
    "this is a crucial point for the assessment of the reliability of fractal analysis of experimental profiles , such as topographic profiles of growing thin films and interfaces acquired with a scanning probe microscope .",
    "we have pointed out that some of the steps leading to the measurement of the hurst exponent have been only superficially discussed , although worth of deeper attention .",
    "we have focused on the quantification of the effects of sampling and possibly on their correction , allowing a more reliable identification of the universality class of growth .    in order to perform such a quantitative analysis",
    "we have developed a new automated fitting protocol that allows to remove the ambiguity in the choice of the region for the linear fit of the analysis functions .",
    "this point is usually underestimated in the published experimental literature , and appears to be a significant source of error in the whole analysis . moreover",
    ", an automated protocol sensibly reduces the time required for the fitting of a large number of noisy curves , allowing a higher statistics . with our automated fitting protocol",
    "we have systematically investigated synthetic self - affine profiles generated with all the generation algorithms found in literature using different method of analysis .",
    "the systematic analysis presented in this paper has been carried out on 1 + 1 dimensional profiles and we have not considered 2-dimensional methods of analysis ( e.g. see @xcite ) . however , it is reasonable to suppose that even in this case the effects of sampling can not be neglected , and the conclusions drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite are probably incorrect .",
    "the similarity between fig . 1 in ref . @xcite and the analogous results presented in this paper ( see the variable bandwidth analysis of profiles generated with the random midpoint displacement shown in fig . [",
    "fig:3]c ) suggests that conclusions very close to those presented here can be drawn also in the 2-dimensional case .",
    "studying the discrepancy between the measured hurst exponent @xmath5 and the `` true '' one ( @xmath4 ) for synthetic self - affine profiles with @xmath30 points , we have shown that the main effects of sampling are a deviation of the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 plots from the ideal behavior and a dispersion of the exponents calculated from different generation algorithms .",
    "both these effects smoothly reduce with increasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "the deviation turns out to be universal in the sense that the trend of the @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 curves is common to all of the generation algorithms , depending only on the number of sampling points and on the function used in the analysis .",
    "we propose that this behavior is reminiscent of the fact that a fractal object is completely characterized by its dimension and therefore the deviation can be at least empirically corrected .",
    "the dispersion instead has to be considered as an intrinsic error due to the sampling , but for the very special case of profiles whose generation algorithm allows to build their specific @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 plot .",
    "this dispersion error must be quantitatively taken into account since it can not be reduced with an increase in the statistics but only with an increase in the number of sampling points .",
    "the existence of an intrinsic dispersion error in the measurement of the hurst exponent that depends only on the number of sampling points is very important .",
    "in fact , this intrinsic error easily overwhelms the statistical error for poorly sampled profiles .",
    "it is definitely clear that a reliable result can not be based on the consideration of the statistical error only .",
    "moreover , the dispersion poses an upper limit to the precision in the measurement of the hurst exponent of sampled profiles .",
    "it becomes useless to increase the statistics once the statistical error has been made reasonably smaller than the intrinsic one .",
    "this is particularly important in an experimental analysis because it usually reduces significantly the number of profiles that have to be acquired , making the analysis much less time consuming .",
    "thanks to our systematic analysis , we have built , for each method of analysis , a calibration graph representing the region of the @xmath5-@xmath4 plane where the true exponents fall within a given confidence level .",
    "we have originally proposed to use these graphs as a reliable empirical method to correct the measured value of the hurst exponent of a poorly sampled profile and to estimate its intrinsic sampling error .",
    "the reliability of the calibration graphs is based on two assumptions :    1 .",
    "the measured exponents for all the possible self - affine profiles , with the same `` true '' exponent @xmath4 and with the same number of sampling points , are normally distributed ; 2 .",
    "the numerical generation algorithms known in literature provide a statistically reliable sample of all the possible self - affine profiles .    even though we have found just six generation algorithms in literature , we believe that they still allow to obtain reasonable results or at least the only ones obtainable to date .",
    "these results represent a step forward to a reliable fractal analysis of both numerical and experimental profiles and to the individuation of the universality classes in the study of the evolution of many different systems .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that a reliable measurement of the hurst exponent of poorly sampled self - affine profiles is possible , provided that the measured @xmath5 is corrected of its deviation and that the sampling error is quantitatively taken into account .",
    "we have thus given strength to experimental analyses , since the numerical results reported in literature to date led to the conclusion that the analysis of self - affine profiles sampled with less than 1000 points is not reliable @xcite .",
    "even with the great improvement introduced by the use of the calibration graphs in the analysis of self - affine profiles , we definitely agree with schmittbuhl _",
    "_ in pointing out that the comparison of the results obtained with different method of analysis is of fundamental importance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we shortly comment on the common experimental procedure of connecting afs calculated from profiles acquired with different scan sizes @xcite .",
    "this connection allows investigating a wider range of length scales with a limited number of sampling points and makes the measurement more reliable .",
    "however , the deviation and dispersion are not influenced by this procedure , since they depend only on the number of sampling points of the profiles on which the afs are calculated .",
    "the afp and the calibration graphs have been tested on numerically generated 1 + 1 dimensional directed percolation ( dp ) profiles , which have provided a benchmark to check our protocol .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath30 profiles a correction is needed and the calibration graphs allow to recover the theoretical value of @xmath1 predicted by the dp model .",
    "we have also shown that a correction is needed even for the @xmath47 profiles , which are widely considered as continuous .",
    "our results provide a powerful tool for the accurate extraction of the hurst exponent from poorly sampled profiles , and for the quantification of the error in the measurement .",
    "this is of paramount importance for experimentalists who study the scale invariance of surfaces and interfaces by scanning probe microscopy or other techniques , with the aim of identifying the underlying universality classes .",
    "the huge amount of experimental results published in the past two decades about the fractality of many interfaces can be now analyzed under a new light ."
