    "we start with a brief review of onsager theory @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete set of unconstrained thermodynamic extensive variables of an isolated system .",
    "onsager theory formulates the deterministic dynamics of the thermodynamic variables in relaxation processes to the equilibrium state .",
    "the time evolution is simply expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the thermodynamic entropy of the system , @xmath3 corresponds to the thermodynamic force , and @xmath4 is called the onsager coefficient .",
    "the important consequence of onsager theory is the reciprocity @xmath5 this nontrivial result was derived by studying fluctuations in equilibrium .",
    "concretely , the fluctuation is assumed to be described by a langevin equation , @xmath6 with the gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption means that the most probable regression process for a given fluctuation is equivalent to the relaxation dynamics , which is referred to as the regression hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , according to equilibrium statistical mechanics , the stationary probability density of @xmath8 is @xmath9 ,    \\label{pss}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the normalization constant .",
    "the time - reversibility of microscopic systems then provides the nontrivial relation @xmath11 which leads to ( [ recip ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ fdr ] ) is referred to as the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the second kind .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ onsager ] ) is a nonlinear equation for @xmath8 because @xmath2 is not necessarily a quadratic function . in the argument above",
    ", @xmath4 is assumed to be independent of @xmath8 . because dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath8 is expected in general cases , it is natural to consider generalized forms of ( [ onsager ] ) and ( [ onsager - noise ] ) .",
    "one approach assumes ( [ onsager - noise ] ) with @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the starting equation , where a multiplication rule for @xmath13 and @xmath14 is specified . once a stochastic system is defined , the stationary distribution for @xmath8 is determined .",
    "we then find that the stationary distribution is not given by ( [ pss ] ) for any multiplication rule for @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "this means that there is no consistent description of ( [ onsager - noise ] ) , ( [ pss ] ) , and ( [ fdr ] ) when dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath8 is considered .",
    "the important thing here is that a generalization of ( [ onsager - noise ] ) with @xmath12 is not obvious at all .",
    "we can now describe the dynamics of @xmath8 on the basis of a hamiltonian system consisting of atoms and molecules .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 is a complete set of slow variables for the system .",
    "examples include a complete set of unconstrained extensive variables in thermodynamics .",
    "then , by using a separation of time scales , we may study the time evolution of @xmath8 from the microscopic mechanical description .",
    "the result is that ( [ onsager - noise ] ) is replaced by @xmath16 where the multiplication of @xmath13 and @xmath15 is interpreted as ito - type , and @xmath17 is the so - called reversible term that does not contribute to changes in entropy .    there is a long history of studies on ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) . in  @xcite , green derived the fokker ",
    "planck equation corresponding to ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) by combining phenomenological arguments with microscopic considerations .",
    "this was the genesis of ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) .",
    "after this paper , many further studies were performed .",
    "for example , green s derivation was improved in  @xcite where fewer assumptions were used .",
    "more formal studies under the microscopic description re - derived the fokker ",
    "planck equation using a projection - operator method  @xcite and a nonequilibrium statistical operator method  @xcite . in another direction , the fokker ",
    "planck equation corresponding to ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) was also derived from a general fokker ",
    "planck equation by imposing a detailed balance condition  @xcite .",
    "finally , the langevin equation ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) was derived directly from liouville s equation using a nonlinear projection operator method  @xcite .",
    "thus ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) was well established by 1975 .    however , the result ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) is less well known nowadays",
    ". there may be two reasons .",
    "first , graham attempted to develop a co - variant description of nonlinear onsager theory .",
    "although this theory is complicated , many papers in this direction followed  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we can not reach a final answer in this direction , but more importantly , we consider such a generalization to not be necessary at all . equation ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) is sufficient to be general and universal .",
    "second , when @xmath8 is a set of extensive variables in thermodynamics , the third term becomes higher - order than the second term from the estimates @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the system size @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , if one combines the system size expansion  @xcite in deriving the equation for slow variables , the third term does not appear for thermodynamically normal systems .",
    "although this argument is correct , we emphasize that ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) can be a starting point for all systems , including small systems , once we identify a complete set of slow variables under equilibrium conditions .",
    "that is , in our opinion , ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) should be recognized as a fundamental equation for slow variables .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to re - derive ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) with particular emphasis of the concept of large deviation  @xcite .",
    "we first assume a complete set of slow variables .",
    "let @xmath21 be the shortest time scale of the slow variables and @xmath22 be the largest time scale of the other dynamical variables .",
    "then , from the separation of time scales @xmath23 , we can find @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "this @xmath26 plays two crucial roles in the derivation of the equation for slow variables .",
    "first , because @xmath27 , we can consider a large deviation function of the time averaged flux as a universal form of the asymptotic behavior of the transition probability of the slow variables during a time interval @xmath24 .",
    "the time reversibility in microscopic hamiltonian systems provides a restriction on the large deviation function .",
    "second , because @xmath28 , this universal form of the transition probability leads to the path integral form of a stochastic system .",
    "this stochastic system is nothing but ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) .",
    "this concept is quite natural and general .",
    "indeed , one can interpret the arguments of onsager and green through this concept .",
    "nevertheless , as far as we know , there is no explicit presentation of the derivation of ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) with large deviation and the path integral form under @xmath25 . we thus expect that this paper will be instructive for understanding the universal form ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) , and will also be useful for deriving the equation for slow variables even in systems out of equilibrium .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : piml ] , as preliminaries for the argument , we review a path integral formulation for a discrete - time langevin equation . as described above , the concept of large deviation",
    "is closely related to the path integral formulation of stochastic processes .",
    "the technical difficulty in the argument arises from its complicated expression , which may be entirely associated with the ill - defined nature of the multiplication of some quantities . to make the argument as clear as possible , we study a path - integral form for discrete - time langevin equations while keeping the time interval @xmath29 finite .",
    "we then find relations between different expressions of the path integral forms as first derived by wissel @xcite .",
    "this recovers each of the correct but apparently different expressions  @xcite . in section  [ sec : nle_bp ] , we consider as a special case a nonlinear langevin equation for the momentum @xmath30 of a brownian particle of mass @xmath31 in a homogeneous environment of temperature @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes multiplication with the anti - ito rule .",
    "although ( [ non - lin - lan ] ) is well known , it has never been recognized as an example of ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) to the best of our knowledge .",
    "indeed , we can derive ( [ non - lin - lan ] ) by using the concept of large deviation .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : nle_ot ] , we derive the general formula ( [ onsager - noise - g ] ) . throughout this paper , the boltzmann constant @xmath35",
    "is set to unity .",
    "let @xmath36 be a collection of dynamical variables .",
    "we study the time evolution of @xmath37 for a fixed time interval @xmath29 . we denote @xmath38 by @xmath39 , and we assume that @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are smooth functions of @xmath37 , @xmath44 is a standard @xmath45-dimensional wiener process  @xcite , and @xmath46 is a gaussian white noise with mean zero and covariance @xmath47 .",
    "because the short time interval @xmath29 can be considered to consist of shorter time intervals , we may use @xmath48 and ignore any @xmath49 terms in the taylor expansion , which is known as it s lemma .",

    "this is interpreted as the transition probability for the discrete time langevin equation ( [ eq : l_multi ] ) . by taking the limit @xmath245",
    ", we obtain @xmath246 where we have used ( [ eq : re_jirr ] ) , and @xmath247 satisfies @xmath248 it should be noted that the third term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : nle_str_m ] ) is not eliminated even if we replace @xmath249 by @xmath250 for general multi - component systems .",
    "we emphasize that the result ( [ eq : nle_str ] ) in the previous section is rather accidental .",
    "in this paper , we have derived a universal form of nonlinear , multiplicative langevin equations for slow variables in equilibrium systems .",
    "the result is essentially equivalent to that derived by green in 1952 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we first assume the separation of time scales .",
    "then , by using large deviation theory , we can formalize the asymptotic behavior of the time - averaged fluxes , which determines the time evolution of the slow variables due to the time - reversal symmetry of fluctuation . before ending this paper ,",
    "we summarize future problems related to this result .",
    "first , although discussions of physical phenomena are out of scope of this paper , it seems interesting to find a system in which the third term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : nle_str_m ] ) plays an important role in phenomena .",
    "we do not know any such examples explicitly , but there are many cases where transportation coefficients strongly depend on thermodynamic variables .",
    "however , it should be noted that the contribution of this term is higher - order in macroscopic systems , as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "we thus seek such systems among small systems or singular systems .",
    "second , we believe that the result and its derivation method may provide the final answer for formally describing slow variables in equilibrium systems . for example , in principle , fluctuating hydrodynamics in equilibrium systems can be studied explicitly using the same method . in this case , we consider long - wavelength fluctuations of locally conserved quantities , which are called hydrodynamic modes , to be slow variables .",
    "although the formulation may be developed similarly to the ideas in this paper , there will be many technical difficulties in performing concrete calculations .",
    "we thus conjecture that a formal derivation of the navier  stokes equation from hamiltonian particle systems  @xcite may be helpful for completing this problem .",
    "related to the argument of fluctuating hydrodynamics , we recall the assumption in section  [ sec : nle_bp ] that the relaxation time of the momentum is much larger than the time scales of the other degrees of freedom .",
    "there are cases where this assumption does not hold when the time scale of hydrodynamic modes is comparable with that of the momentum of a brownian particle , as observed in recent experiments  @xcite . deriving the langevin equation describing the motion observed in these experiments",
    "is also a challenging task .",
    "third , the obvious problem we should study in future is formulating the stochastic evolution of slow variables in systems out of equilibrium .",
    "if the time scales are separated so that the slow variables are clearly defined , then the concept of large deviation can be used even in nonequilibrium cases .",
    "of course , there are many nonequilibrium phenomena in which a complete set of slow variables is not identified .",
    "although these have interesting phenomena , we do not have a systematic method for studying them .",
    "putting such systems aside , we focus on systems where the slow variables are defined .",
    "if the gaussian form of the large deviation function is effective , then the dynamics of the slow variables will be described by a langevin equation . even for this simple class , we do not have a general form , because the symmetry property ( [ eq : db_m ] ) can not be used .",
    "rather , one may find that difficulties already appear in writing a deterministic equation for slow variables before considering stochastic systems .",
    "nevertheless , our method will be applied to the brownian motion in nonuniform temperatures where the system satisfies the detailed balance condition as studied in  @xcite .    finally , recent work explicitly derived deterministic order parameter equations near the order - disorder transition of the globally coupled xy model and the synchronization - desynchronization transition of the kuramoto model  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the derivation method here is to use nonequilibrium identities such as the jarzynski equality  @xcite and the hatano  sasa equality  @xcite . although we need to assume a rather special type of probability distribution at the initial time , the calculation steps are substantially reduced .",
    "we thus expect that the unified framework of the approach in  @xcite and the theory developed in this paper may be the first step in the universal description of the stochastic evolution of slow variables out of equilibrium .",
