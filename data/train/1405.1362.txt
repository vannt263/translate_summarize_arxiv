    "electronic transport of heat in josephson junctions is facilitated by transfer of quasiparticles from one side to the other .",
    "andreev reflections transfer no heat , and so only quasiparticles contribute .",
    "consequently , the heat transport statistics follows directly from the counting statistics of these excitations .",
    "exactly as in normal - state junctions , @xcite this is determined by the transmission eigenvalues of an appropriate scattering problem . in the superconducting state , this statistics is described by bogoliubov  de gennes transmission eigenvalues .",

    "we considered both above - gap and sub - gap transport of heat , the latter by using a toy model for the broadening of the density of states in the superconductors .",
    "the general picture that emerges is that sub - gap heat transport is significantly more sensitive to the phase difference in transparent junctions than in tunnel junctions .",

    "the fluctuation statistics of heat current can be measured using similar approaches as previously used for studying the heat currents .",
    "@xcite for example , one can make the heat capacity of one of the terminals small , and then observe the fluctuation of its total energy via temperature measurements using established experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "setups utilizing several metal islands @xcite could also be a viable approach for probing the statistics experimentally .    in summary ,",
    "we consider heat current driven by a temperature difference across josephson junctions of varying transparency .",
    "we obtain the generating function of fluctuation statistics in closed form .",
    "in addition to describing the fluctuations of heat current , the results provide a way to understand the average heat current in terms of elementary transmission events .",
