    "hlawka inequality is mentioned several times in the literature ; it is explicitly stated , in differing forms , in  @xcite . in some of these instances",
    "it is stated without the transformation procedure and without using the incorrect identity   ( which means that in those cases it is stated roughly in the same form as our theorem  [ th1 ] or corollary  [ th3 ] ) . in other cases , the transformation from uniform distribution to an other distribution and the ( incorrect ) identity   are explicitly accentuated .",
    "for example , after stating chelson s theorem in its original form , in  @xcite the authors write    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it is important to note in [ the statement of chelson s theorem ] that even though the sampling technique has changed the sequence used to evaluate [ the function ] , the discrepancy appearing in the error bound is still that of the original sequence . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a generalization of chelson s results is apparently contained in the phd thesis of maize  @xcite , which we can not access ( but judging from the statement of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 ) , it probably suffers from the same problem as chelson s original results ) . in",
    "@xcite a generalization of chelson s results is `` proved '' , repeating chelson s errors .",
    "actually , in  @xcite the author proves the analogue of   only in the one - dimensional case ( in which it is true ) and writes that _ the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward _ ( which is actually not the case ) .",
    "it seems that the first time that a correct version of   is stated in the literature is in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) , where it is assumed that the measure @xmath0 has a density which is the product of @xmath2 one - dimensional densities .",
    "strangely , in  @xcite this result is attributed to  @xcite , where the additional assumption that @xmath0 is of product form does not appear ( and the result is stated in an incorrect form , as noted above ) .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the assumption that @xmath0 possesses a density is not necessary in order to assure that the @xmath0-discrepancy of the transformed point set is dominated by the discrepancy of the original point set when @xmath0 is of product form .",
    "thus a general correct version of   would look as follows .",
    "[ thinv ] let @xmath0 be a normalized borel measure on @xmath3^d$ ] , and let @xmath348 be its distribution function .",
    "assume that there exist @xmath2 one - dimensional normalized borel measures @xmath349 having distribution functions @xmath318 such that @xmath350 let @xmath351:~g_s(x ) \\geq y \\ } , \\qquad y \\in [ 0,1],\\ ] ] be the ( pseudo-)inverse of @xmath293 for @xmath352 .",

    "then @xmath354 if all the functions @xmath318 are invertible , then in   we have equality .",
    "we define a function @xmath355 which maps @xmath356 to @xmath357 .",
    "let @xmath67 be given , and let @xmath358 denote the set @xmath359 .",
    "note the important fact that @xmath358 is again an element of @xmath9 .",
    "we have @xmath360 taking absolute values and the supremum over all sets @xmath67 , inequality   follows .",
    "+ if all functions @xmath318 are invertible , then the mapping @xmath361 is a bijection from the class @xmath9 to itself , and @xmath355 is the inverse of @xmath302 .",
    "thus in this case the suprema @xmath362 and @xmath363 coincide , which implies that in   there must be equality .",
