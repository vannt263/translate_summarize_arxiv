    "in the seventies , there was a flurry of activity in black hole physics which brought out an unexpected interplay between general relativity , quantum field theory and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "that analysis was carried out only in the semi - classical approximation , i.e. , either in the framework of lorentzian quantum field theories in curved space - times or by keeping just the leading order , zero - loop terms in euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "nonetheless , since it brought together the three pillars of fundamental physics , it is widely believed that these results capture an essential aspect of the more fundamental description of nature . for over twenty years",
    ", a concrete challenge to all candidate quantum theories of gravity has been to derive these results from first principles , without having to invoke semi - classical approximations .",
    "specifically , the early work is based on a somewhat ad - hoc mixture of classical and semi - classical ideas reminiscent of the bohr model of the atom and generally ignored the quantum nature of the gravitational field itself .",
    "for example , statistical mechanical parameters were associated with macroscopic black holes as follows",
    ". the laws of black hole mechanics were first derived in the framework of _ classical _ general relativity , without any reference to the planck s constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it was then noted that they have a remarkable similarity with the laws of thermodynamics if one identifies a multiple of the surface gravity @xmath1 of the black hole with temperature and a corresponding multiple of the area @xmath2 of its horizon with entropy .",
    "however , simple dimensional considerations and thought experiments showed that the multiples must involve @xmath0 , making quantum considerations indispensable for a fundamental understanding of the relation between black hole mechanics and thermodynamics @xcite . subsequently",
    ", hawking s investigation of ( test ) quantum fields propagating on a black hole geometry showed that black holes emit thermal radiation at temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it therefore seemed natural to assume that black holes themselves are hot and their temperature @xmath4 is the same as @xmath5 .",
    "the similarity between the two sets of laws then naturally suggested that one associate entropy @xmath6 with a black hole of area @xmath7 . while this procedure seems very reasonable , these considerations can not be regarded as providing a `` fundamental derivation '' of the thermodynamic parameters of black holes .",
    "the challenge is to derive these formulas from first principles , i.e. , by regarding large black holes as statistical mechanical systems in a suitable quantum gravity framework .",
    "recall the situation in familiar statistical mechanical systems such as a gas , a magnet or a black body . to calculate their thermodynamic parameters such as entropy",
    ", one has to first identify the elementary building blocks that constitute the system . for a gas ,",
    "these are molecules ; for a magnet , elementary spins ; for the radiation field in a black body , photons .",
    "what are the analogous building blocks for black holes ?",
    "they can not be gravitons because the gravitational fields under consideration are stationary .",
    "therefore , the elementary constituents must be non - perturbative in the field theoretic sense .",
    "thus , to account for entropy from first principles within a candidate quantum gravity theory , one would have to : i ) isolate these constituents ; ii ) show that , for large black holes , the number of quantum states of these constituents goes as the exponential of the area of the event horizon ; iii ) account for the hawking radiation in terms of quantum processes involving these constituents and matter quanta ; and , iv ) derive the laws of black hole thermodynamics from quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "these are difficult tasks , particularly because the very first step isolating the relevant constituents requires new conceptual as well as mathematical inputs .",
    "furthermore , in the semi - classical theory , thermodynamic properties have been associated not only with black holes but also with cosmological horizons .",
    "therefore , the framework has to be sufficiently general to encompass these diverse situations .",
    "it is only recently , more than twenty years after the initial flurry of activity , that detailed proposals have emerged .",
    "the more well - known of these comes from string theory @xcite where the relevant elementary constituents are associated with d - branes which lie outside the original perturbative sector of the theory .",
    "the purpose of this series of articles is to develop another scenario , which emphasizes the quantum nature of geometry , using non - perturbative techniques from the very beginning . here",
    ", the elementary constituents are the quantum excitations of geometry itself and the hawking process now corresponds to the conversion of the quanta of geometry to quanta of matter . although the two approaches seem to be strikingly different from one another , we will see @xcite that they are in certain sense complementary .",
    "an outline of ideas behind our approach was given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we will develop in detail the classical theory that underlies our analysis .",
    "the next paper @xcite will be devoted to the details of quantization and to the derivation of the entropy formula for large black holes from statistical mechanical considerations .",
    "a preliminary account of the black hole radiance in this approach was given in @xcite and work is now in progress on completing that analysis .",
    "a derivation of the laws governing isolated horizons which generalize the standard zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics normally proved in the stationary context is given in @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of our classical framework is to overcome three limitations that are faced by most of the existing treatments .",
    "first , isolated black holes are generally represented by _",
    "stationary _ solutions of field equations , i.e. , solutions which admit a translational killing vector field _",
    "everywhere _ , not just in a small neighborhood of the black hole . while this simple idealization was appropriate in the early development of the subject ,",
    "it does seem overly restrictive .",
    "physically , it should be sufficient to impose boundary conditions at the horizon to ensure _ only that the black hole itself is isolated_. that is , it should suffice to demand only that the intrinsic geometry of the horizon be time independent although the geometry outside may be dynamical and admit gravitational and other radiation .",
    "indeed , we adopt a similar viewpoint in ordinary thermodynamics ; in the standard description of equilibrium configurations of systems such as a classical gas , one usually assumes that only the system is in equilibrium and stationary , not the whole world . for black holes , in realistic situations ,",
    "one is typically interested in the final stages of collapse where the black hole is formed and has `` settled down '' ( figure 1 ) or in situations in which an already formed black hole is isolated for the duration of the experiment . in such situations ,",
    "there is likely to be gravitational radiation and non - stationary matter far away from the black hole , whence the space - time as a whole is not expected to be stationary .",
    "surely , black hole thermodynamics should be applicable in such situations .",
    "the second limitation comes from the fact that the classical framework is generally geared to _ event _ horizons which can only be constructed retroactively , after knowing the _ complete _ evolution of space - time .",
    "consider for example , figure 2 in which a spherical star of mass @xmath8 undergoes a gravitational collapse .",
    "the singularity is hidden inside the null surface @xmath9 at @xmath10 which is foliated by a family of trapped surfaces and which would be a part of the event horizon if nothing further happens in the future .",
    "however , let us suppose that , after a very long time , a thin spherical shell of mass @xmath11 collapses",
    ". then , @xmath9 would not be a part of the event horizon which would actually lie slightly outside @xmath9 and coincide with the surface @xmath12 in distant future .",
    "however , on physical grounds , it seems unreasonable to exclude @xmath9 a priori from all thermodynamical considerations .",
    "surely , one should be able to establish laws of black hole mechanics not only for the event horizon but also for @xmath9 .",
    "another example is provided by cosmological horizons in the de sitter space - time . in this space - time , there are no singularities or event horizons . on the other hand ,",
    "semi - classical considerations enable one to assign entropy and temperature to these horizons as well .",
    "this suggests that the notion of event horizons is too restrictive for thermodynamic considerations .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case ; as far as equilibrium properties are concerned , the notion of event horizons can be replaced by a more general , quasi - local notion of `` isolated horizons '' for which the familiar laws continue to hold . the surface @xmath9 in figure 2 as well as the cosmological horizons in de sitter space - times are examples of isolated horizons .",
    "the third limitation is that most of the existing classical treatments fail to provide a natural point of departure for quantization . in a systematic approach",
    ", one would first extract an appropriate sector of the theory in which space - time geometries satisfy suitable conditions at interior boundaries representing horizons , then introduce a well - defined action principle tailored to these boundary conditions , and finally construct the hamiltonian framework by spelling out the symplectic structure , constraints , gauge and dynamics .",
    "by contrast , treatments of black hole mechanics are often based on differential geometric identities and field equations and not concerned with issues related to quantization .",
    "we will see that all these steps necessary for quantization can be carried out in the context of isolated horizons .    at first sight",
    ", it may appear that only a small extension of the standard framework based on stationary event horizons may be needed to overcome these three limitations .",
    "however , this is not the case . for example",
    ", if there is radiation outside the black hole , one can not identify the adm mass with the mass of the black hole .",
    "hence , to formulate the first law , a new expression of the black hole mass is needed .",
    "similarly , in absence of a space - time killing field , we need to generalize the notion of surface gravity in a non - trivial fashion .",
    "indeed , even if the space - time happens to be static but only in a neighborhood of the horizon already a stronger condition than what is contemplated above the notion of surface gravity is ambiguous because the standard expression fails to be invariant under constant rescalings of the killing field .",
    "global _ killing field exists , the ambiguity is removed by requiring that the killing field be unit at _",
    "infinity_. thus , contrary to what one would intuitively expect ,",
    "the standard notion of surface gravity of a stationary black hole refers not just to the structure at the horizon but also that at infinity .",
    "this `` normalization problem '' in the definition of surface gravity seems difficult especially in the cosmological context where cauchy surfaces are compact .",
    "apart from these conceptual problems , a host of technical issues need to be resolved because , in the einstein - maxwell theory , while the space of stationary solutions with event horizons is finite dimensional , the space of solutions admitting isolated horizons is _ infinite _ dimensional , since these solutions can admit radiation near infinity . as a result ,",
    "the introduction of a well - defined action principle is subtle and the hamiltonian framework acquires certain qualitatively new features .    the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] recalls the formulation of general relativity in terms of @xmath13-spin soldering forms and self dual connections for asymptotically flat space - times _ without _ internal boundaries .",
    "section [ sec3 ] specifies the boundary conditions that define for us isolated , non - rotating horizons and discusses those consequences of these boundary conditions that are needed in the hamiltonian formulation and quantization .",
    "it turns out that the usual action ( with its boundary term at infinity ) is not functionally differentiable in presence of isolated horizons .",
    "however , one can add to it a chern - simons term at the horizon to make it differentiable .",
    "this unexpected interplay between general relativity and chern - simons theory is discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "it also contains a discussion of the resulting phase space , symplectic structure , constraints and gauge on which quantization @xcite will be based . for simplicity ,",
    "up to this point , the entire discussion refers to vacuum general relativity .",
    "the modifications that are necessary for incorporating electro - magnetic and dilatonic hair are discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "section [ sec6 ] summarizes the main results .",
    "some of our constructions and results are similar to those that have appeared in the literature in different contexts .",
    "in particular , the ideas introduced in section [ sec3 ] are closely related to those introduced by hayward in an interesting series of papers @xcite which also aims at providing a more physical framework for discussing black holes .",
    "our introduction in section [ sec4 ] of the boundary term in the action uses the same logic as in the work of regge and teitelboim @xcite , hawking and gibbons @xcite and others .",
    "the specific form of the boundary term is the same as that in the work of momen @xcite , balachandran et al @xcite , and smolin @xcite . however , the procedure used to arrive at the term and its physical and mathematical role are quite different . these similarities and differences",
    "are discussed at the appropriate places in the text .",
    "in this paper we use a formulation of general relativity @xcite in which it is a dynamical theory of connections rather than metrics .",
    "this shift of the point of view does not change the theory classically and is therefore not essential to the discussion of results that hold in classical general relativity , such as the ( generalized ) laws of black hole mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , this shift makes the kinematics of general relativity the same as that of @xmath14 yang - mills theory , thereby suggesting new non - perturbative routes to quantization .",
    "the quantum theory , discussed in detail in the accompanying paper @xcite , uses this route in an essential way .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will discuss the boundary conditions , action and the hamiltonian framework using connection variables . to fix notation and to acquaint the reader with the basic ideas , in this section",
    "we will recall some facts on the classical connection dynamics .",
    "( for further details see , e.g. , @xcite . ) for definiteness , we will tailor our main discussion to the case in which the cosmological constant @xmath15 vanishes .",
    "incorporation of a non - zero @xmath15 only requires appropriate changes in the boundary conditions and surface terms at infinity .",
    "the structure at isolated horizons will remain unchanged .      fix a 4-dimensional manifold @xmath16 with only one asymptotic region .",
    "our basic fields will consist of a pair @xmath17 of asymptotically flat , smooth fields where @xmath18 is a soldering form for ( primed and unprimed ) @xmath13 spinors ( sometimes referred to as a ` tetrad ' ) and @xmath19 is an @xmath13 connection on unprimed spinors .",
    "thus , our spinor fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 are just cross - sections of 2-dimensional complex vector bundles equipped with 2-forms @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "spinor indices are raised and lowered using these two forms , e.g. , @xmath24 .",
    "for details , see , e.g. , @xcite and appendix a. ] @xcite .",
    "each pair @xmath25 represents a possible history .",
    "the action is given by @xcite @xmath26 & = & -{i\\over 8\\pi g}\\,\\,\\left[\\int_{\\cal m}\\ , { \\rm tr}\\left(\\sigma\\wedge f\\right ) - \\int_{\\cal t } { \\rm tr } \\left(\\sigma\\wedge a \\right ) \\right ] \\\\",

    "if we define a metric @xmath34 of signature @xmath35 via @xmath36 , then the 2-forms @xmath28 are self - dual ( see @xcite , appendix a. ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the natural volume 4-form defined by the metric @xmath34 .",
    "the equations of motion follow from variation of the action ( [ action ] ) . varying ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath31 one gets [ eom1 ] = 0 .",
    "this equation implies that the connection @xmath39 defined by @xmath31 coincides with the restriction to unprimed spinors of the torsion - free connection @xmath40 defined by the soldering form @xmath41 via @xmath42 .",
    "the connection @xmath40 acts on tensor fields as well as primed and unprimed spinor fields .",
    "thus , @xmath31 is now the self - dual part of the spin - connection compatible with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a relation between the curvature @xmath30 and the riemann curvature of the metric @xmath34 determined by @xmath41 : @xmath30 is the self - dual part of the riemann tensor : @xmath43 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , p. 292 ) . using this expression of the 2-form @xmath30 in ( [ action ] )",
    "one finds that the volume term in the action reduces precisely to the einstein - hilbert term : @xmath44 the numerical coefficients in ( [ action ] ) were chosen to ensure this precise reduction .",
    "varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath41 and taking into account the fact that @xmath31 is compatible with @xmath41 , we obtain a second equation of motion [ eom2 ] g_ab= 0 where @xmath45 is the einstein tensor of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the equations of motion that follow from the action ( [ action ] ) are the same as those that follow from the usual einstein - hilbert action ; the two theories are classically equivalent .",
    "we are now ready to perform a legendre transform to pass to the hamiltonian description .",
    "for this , we now assume that the space - time manifold @xmath16 is topologically @xmath46 for some 3-manifold @xmath8 , with no internal boundaries and a single asymptotic region .",
    "the basic phase - space variables turn out to be simply the pull - backs to @xmath8 of the connection @xmath31 and the 2-forms @xmath28 . to avoid proliferation of symbols",
    ", we will use the same notation for the four - dimensional fields and their pull - backs to @xmath8 ; the context will make it clear which of the two sets we are referring to .    the geometrical meaning of these phase - space variables is as follows .",
    "recall first that the four - dimensional @xmath13-soldering form on @xmath16 induces on @xmath8 a 3-dimensional @xmath14 soldering form @xmath47 for @xmath14 `` space - spinors '' on @xmath8 via @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the projection operator of @xmath8 and @xmath50 is the spinorial representation of the future directed , unit normal @xmath51 to @xmath8 .",
    "the intrinsic metric @xmath52 on @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath53 .",
    "the 2-forms @xmath28 , pulled - back to @xmath8 , are closely related to the dual of these @xmath14 soldering forms .",
    "more precisely , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the determinant of the 3-metric @xmath52 on @xmath8 . to see the geometric meaning of @xmath31 ,",
    "recall first that the @xmath14 soldering form @xmath41 determines a unique torsion - free derivative operator on ( tensor and ) spinor fields on @xmath8 .",
    "denote the corresponding spin - connection by @xmath56 .",
    "then , assuming that the compatibility condition ( [ eom1 ] ) holds , difference between the ( pulled - back ) connection @xmath31 and @xmath57 is given by the extrinsic curvature @xmath58 of @xmath8 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "( the awkward factors of @xmath61 here and related formulas in sections [ sec2.2 ] and [ sec4.3 ] disappear if one works in the adjoint rather than the fundamental representation of @xmath14 .",
    "see @xcite , chapter 5 . ) thus , while @xmath57 depends only on the spatial derivatives of the @xmath14 soldering form @xmath41 , @xmath31 depends on both spatial and temporal derivatives .",
    "the phase space consists of pairs @xmath62 of smooth fields on the 3-manifold @xmath8 subject to asymptotic conditions which are induced by the asymptotic behavior of fields on @xmath16 .",
    "these require that the pair of fields be asymptotically flat on @xmath8 in the following sense . to begin with ,",
    "let us fix an @xmath14 soldering form @xmath63 on @xmath8 such that the 3-metric @xmath64 it determines is flat outside of a compact set .",
    "then the dynamical fields @xmath65 are required to satisfy : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the radial coordinate defined by the flat metric @xmath68 .    using the `` covariant phase space formalism ''",
    ", one can use a standard procedure to obtain a symplectic one - form from the action and take its curl to arrive at the symplectic structure on the phase space .",
    "the result is : @xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 denotes a tangent vector to the phase space at the point @xmath71 .",
    "note that , although the action has a boundary term at infinity , the symplectic structure does not .",
    "this completes the specification of the phase space . on this space ,",
    "the 3 + 1 form of einstein s equations is especially simple ; all equations are low order polynomials in the basic phase space variables .",
    "laws governing isolated horizons in classical general relativity are discussed within this framework in @xcite .      for passage to quantum theory , however , this framework is not as suitable . to see this ,",
    "note first that since we wish to borrow techniques from yang - mills theories , it is natural to use connections @xmath31 as the configuration variables and let the quantum states be represented by suitable functions of ( possibly generalized ) connections .",
    "then , the development of quantum theory would require tools from functional analysis on the space of connections .",
    "moreover , to maintain diffeomorphism covariance , this analysis should be carried out without recourse to a background structure such as a metric . however , as noted above , the connections @xmath31 are complex ( they take values in the lie algebra @xmath72 rather than @xmath73 ) and , as matters stand , the required functional analysis has been developed fully only on the space of real connections @xcite ; work is still in progress to extend the framework to encompass complex connections .",
    "therefore , at this stage , the quantization strategy that has been most successful has been to perform a canonical transformation to manifestly real variables .",
    "since the primary goal of this paper is to provide a hamiltonian description which can serve as a platform for quantization in @xcite , we will now discuss these real variables .",
    "the expression @xmath74 of the @xmath13 connection in terms of real fields @xmath57 and @xmath75 suggests an appropriate strategy @xcite .",
    "for each non - zero real number @xmath76 , let us set @xmath77 it is not hard to check that variables @xmath78 are canonically conjugate in the sense that the symplectic structure is given by : @xmath79.\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are arbitrary tangent vectors to the phase space at the point @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in the final picture , the real phase space is coordinatized by manifestly real fields @xmath83 which are smooth and are subject to the asymptotic conditions : @xmath84 where , as before , @xmath67 is the radial coordinate defined by the flat metric @xmath68 .",
    "the symplectic structure is given by ( [ sym2 ] ) .",
    "irrespective of the values of the real parameter @xmath76 , all these hamiltonian theories are classically equivalent .",
    "they serve as the starting point for non - perturbative canonical quantization . however , it turns out that the corresponding quantum theories are unitarily _ inequivalent _ @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a quantization ambiguity and a one parameter family of inequivalent quantum theories , parameterized by @xmath76 , which is referred to as the _ immirzi parameter .",
    "_ this ambiguity is similar to the @xmath85-ambiguity in qcd where , again , the classical theories are equivalent for all values of @xmath85 while the quantum theories are not @xcite .",
    "the inequivalence will play an important role in the next paper @xcite .",
    "_ remark : _ the original description in terms of pairs @xmath71 is `` hybrid '' in the sense that @xmath28 are @xmath86-valued 2-forms while @xmath31 are @xmath72 valued one - forms .",
    "the phase space is , however , real .",
    "this is analogous to using @xmath87 as `` coordinates '' on the real phase space of a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "consequently , there are `` reality conditions '' that have to be taken into account to eliminate the over - completeness of the basic variables .",
    "these are trivialized in the manifestly real description in terms of @xmath83 in the sense that now all variables are real .",
    "however , while @xmath31 has a natural geometrical interpretation it is the pull - back to @xmath8 of the self - dual part of the connection compatible with the four - dimensional @xmath13 soldering form the real connections @xmath88 do not . indeed , their meaning in the four dimensional",
    ", space - time setting is quite unclear .",
    "furthermore , the form of the hamiltonian constraint in terms of @xmath89 is complicated which made real variables undesirable in the early literature .",
    "however , thanks to the more recent work of thiemann @xcite , now this technical complication does not appear to be a major obstruction .    in the next two sections",
    ", we will return to the original , self - dual @xmath13 connections @xmath31 and @xmath13 soldering form @xmath41 discussed in section [ sec2.1 ] and extend the framework outlined in the beginning of this section to the context where there is an internal boundary representing an isolated horizon .",
    "after casting this extended framework in a hamiltonian form , in section [ sec4.3 ] we will again carry out the canonical transformation and pass to manifestly real variables .",
    "as explained in the introduction , in this series of papers , we wish to consider isolated horizons rather than stationary ones .",
    "space - times of interest will now have an internal boundary , topologically @xmath90 and , as before , one asymptotic region .",
    "the internal boundary will represent an _ isolated , non - rotating horizon_. ( the restriction on rotation is only for technical simplicity and we hope to treat rotating horizons in subsequent papers . ) a typical example is shown in figure 1 which depicts a stellar gravitational collapse .",
    "the space - time of interest is the wedge shaped region , bounded by the future piece @xmath91 of the horizon , future null infinity @xmath92 and a partial cauchy surface extending from the past boundary of @xmath91 to spatial infinity @xmath93 . in a realistic collapse one expects emission of gravitational waves to infinity , whence the underlying space - time can not be assumed to be stationary .",
    "there would be some back - scattering initially and a part of the emitted radiation will fall in to the black hole .",
    "but one expects , e.g. , from numerical simulations , that the horizon will `` settle down '' rather quickly . in the asymptotic region near @xmath94",
    ", we can assume that the part @xmath91 of the horizon is non - dynamical and isolated to a very good approximation ; here , the area of the horizon will be constant .",
    "we now wish to impose on the internal boundary @xmath91 precise conditions which will capture these intuitive ideas . while they will in particular incorporate isolated _ event _ horizons , as noted in the introduction , the conditions are quasi - local and therefore also allow more general possibilities .",
    "all results obtained in this series of papers the presence of the chern - simons boundary term in the action , the hamiltonian formulation , the derivation of generalized laws of black hole mechanics and the calculation of entropy will hold in this more general context .",
    "this strongly suggests that it is the notion of _ isolated horizons _ , rather than event horizons of stationary black holes that is directly relevant to the interplay between general relativity , quantum field theory and statistical mechanics , discovered in the seventies .",
    "for example , although there is no black hole in the de sitter space - time , the cosmological horizons it admits are isolated horizons in our sense and our framework @xcite leads to the hawking temperature and entropy normally associated with these horizons @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to give the general definition and discuss the physical meaning and mathematical consequences of the conditions it contains .",
    "although the primary applications of the framework will be to general relativity ( possibly with a cosmological constant ) coupled to maxwell and dilatonic fields , in this and the next section we will allow general matter , subject only to the conditions stated explicitly in the definition .",
    "the internal boundary @xmath91 of a history @xmath95 will be said to represent _ a non - rotating isolated horizon _ provided the following conditions hold will stand for `` equal at points of @xmath91 to '' , a single under - arrow will denote pull - back to @xmath91 and , a double under - arrow , pull - back to the preferred 2-sphere cross - sections s of @xmath91 . ] :    * \\(i ) _ manifold conditions : _",

    "then , if @xmath101 and @xmath102 is a spinor - dyad on @xmath91 , satisfying @xmath103 , such that @xmath104 and @xmath105 , then the following conditions should hold : + ( iv.a ) @xmath106 ; and + ( iv.b ) @xmath107 , + where @xmath108 is the derivative operator defined by @xmath31 , @xmath109 is a positive function on @xmath91 ( which is constant on each 2-sphere s in the foliation ) , and @xmath110 is a complex vector field tangential to the preferred family of 2-spheres . *",

    "note that these conditions are imposed _ only _ at @xmath91 and , furthermore , the main condition involves only those geometrical fields which are defined intrinsically on @xmath91 .",
    "let us first discuss the geometrical and physical meaning of these conditions to see why they capture the intuitive notions discussed above .",
    "the first three conditions are rather weak and are satisfied on a variety of null surfaces in , e.g. , the schwarzschild space - time ( and indeed in any null cone in minkowski space ) .",
    "in essence it is the fourth condition that pins down the surface as an isolated horizon .",
    "the first condition is primarily topological .",
    "the second condition simply asks that @xmath91 be a null surface with @xmath99 as its null normal .",
    "the third is a dynamical condition , completely analogous to the one normally imposed at null infinity .",
    "the last condition restricts matter fields that may be present on the horizon .",
    "condition ( v.a ) is mild ; it follows from the ( much more restrictive ) dominant energy condition .",
    "it is satisfied by matter fields normally used in classical general relativity , and in particular by the maxwell and dilatonic fields considered here .",
    "condition ( v.b ) is a stronger restriction which is used in our framework to ensure that the black hole is non - rotating .",
    "its specific form does seem somewhat mysterious from a physical viewpoint .",
    "however , we will see in section [ sec5 ] that , in the einstein - maxwell - dilatonic system , this condition is well - motivated from detailed considerations of the matter sector . in the general context considered here , it serves to pinpoint in a concise fashion the conditions that matter fields need to satisfy to render the _ gravitational part _ of the action differentiable .",
    "let us now turn to the key conditions ( iv ) .",
    "these conditions restrict the pull - back to @xmath91 of the connection @xmath108 defined by @xmath31 , or , equivalently , of the connection @xmath40 compatible with @xmath41 since the dynamical condition ( iii ) implies that , on @xmath91 , the action of these two operators agree on unprimed spinors .",
    "the pull - backs to @xmath91 are essential because the spinor fields @xmath113 and @xmath114 are defined only on @xmath91 .",
    "however , a subtlety arises because there is a rescaling freedom in @xmath113 and @xmath114 . to see this ,",
    "let us change our labeling of the preferred foliation via @xmath115 ( with @xmath116 ) .",
    "then , @xmath117 and @xmath118 get rescaled and therefore also the spin - dyad : @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "it is easy to verify that conditions ( iv ) continue to be satisfied in the tilde frame with @xmath122 .",
    "thus , conditions ( iv ) are unambiguous : if they are satisfied for a dyad @xmath123 then they are satisfied by all dyads obtained from it by permissible rescalings .",
    "the content of these conditions is as follows .",
    "( iv.a ) is equivalent to asking that the null vector field @xmath96 be geodesic , twist - free , expansion - free and shear - free .",
    "the first two of these properties follow already from ( ii ) .",
    "furthermore , ( v.a ) and the raychaudhuri equation imply that if the mild energy condition @xmath124 is satisfied and @xmath118 is expansion - free , it is also shear - free .",
    "thus , physically , the only new restriction imposed by ( iv.a ) is that @xmath118 be expansion - free .",
    "it is equivalent to the condition that the area 2-form of the 2-sphere cross - sections of @xmath91 be constant in time which in turn captures the idea that the horizon is isolated .",
    "condition ( iv.b ) is equivalent to asking that the vector field @xmath125 is shear and twist - free , its expansion is spherically symmetric , given by @xmath126 and its newman penrose coefficient @xmath127 vanish on @xmath91 .",
    "these properties imply that the isolated horizon is non - rotating .",
    "since , furthermore , @xmath109 is required to be positive , we are asking that the expansion of the congruence @xmath125 be _ negative_.",
    "this captures the idea that we are interested in future horizons rather than past , i.e. , black holes rather than white holes . finally , note that rather than fixing a preferred foliation in the beginning , we could have required only that a foliation satisfying our conditions exists .",
    "the requirement ( iv.b ) implies that the foliation is unique .",
    "furthermore , it has a natural geometrical meaning : since the expansion of @xmath117 is constant in this foliation , it is the analog for null surfaces of the constant mean curvature slicing often used to foliate space - times .",
    "let us summarize .",
    "non - rotating , isolated horizons @xmath91 are null surfaces , foliated by a family of marginally trapped 2-spheres with the property that the expansion of the inward pointing null normal @xmath128 to the foliation is constant on each leaf and negative .",
    "the presence of trapped surfaces motivates the label ` horizon ' while the fact that they are _ marginally _ trapped i.e .",
    ", that the expansion of @xmath99 vanishes accounts for the adjective ` isolated ' .",
    "the condition that the expansion of @xmath125 is negative says that @xmath91 is a future horizon rather than past and the additional restrictions on the derivative of @xmath128 imply that @xmath91 is non - rotating .",
    "boundary conditions refer only to the behavior of fields at @xmath91 and the general spirit is very similar to the way one formulates boundary conditions at null infinity .    _",
    "remarks : _",
    "\\a ) all the boundary conditions are satisfied by static black holes in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory possibly with a cosmological constant . to incorporate rotating black holes",
    ", one would only have to weaken conditions ( iv.b ) and ( v.b ) ; the rest of the framework will remain unchanged .",
    "( recent results of lewandowski @xcite show that we can continue to require that the expansion of @xmath128 be spherically symmetric in the rotating case .",
    "however @xmath128 would now have shear whence , there would be an additional term proportional to @xmath129 on the right side of ( iv.b ) . )",
    "similarly , one may be primarily interested in solutions to einstein s equations with matter without regard to whether the theory admits a well - defined action principle or a hamiltonian formulation .",
    "then , one may in particular want to allow matter rings and cages around the horizon .",
    "with such sources , the horizons can be distorted even in static situations .",
    "to incorporate such black holes , again , one would only have to weaken conditions ( iv.b ) and ( v.b ) .",
    "\\b ) note however that , in the non - static context , there may well exist physically interesting distorted black holes satisfying our conditions . indeed , one can solve for all our conditions and show that the resulting 4-metrics need not be static or spherically symmetric on @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "( we will see explicitly in sections [ sec3.2 ] and [ sec5.1 ] that the weyl curvature and the maxwell field need not be spherically symmetric near @xmath91 . ) since the boundary conditions allow such histories and since we are primarily interested in histories or , in the hamiltonian formulation , the full phase space rather than classical solutions in this paper and its sequel @xcite , we chose the adjective ` non - rotating ' rather than ` spherical ' while referring to these isolated horizons .",
    "\\c ) in the choice of boundary conditions , we have tried to strike the usual balance : on the one hand the conditions are strong enough to enable one to prove interesting results ( e.g. , a well - defined action principle , a hamiltonian framework , and a generalization of black hole mechanics ) and , on the other hand , they are weak enough to allow a large class of examples .",
    "as we already remarked , the standard non - rotating black holes in the einstein - maxwell - dilatonic systems satisfy these conditions .",
    "more importantly , starting with the standard static black holes and using known existence theorems one can specify procedures to construct new solutions to field equations which admit isolated horizons as well as radiation at null infinity @xcite .",
    "these examples already show that , while the standard static solutions have only a finite parameter freedom , the space of solutions admitting isolated horizons is _ infinite _ dimensional .",
    "thus , in the hamiltonian picture , even the reduced phase - space is infinite dimensional ; the conditions indeed admit a very large class of examples .      in the bulk , the symmetry group is the group of automorphisms of the @xmath13 spin - bundle , i.e. , the semi - direct product of local @xmath13 transformations on spinor fields with the diffeomorphism group of @xmath16 .",
    "the boundary conditions impose restrictions on dynamical fields and hence also on the permissible behavior of these transformations on boundaries .",
    "the restrictions at infinity are well - known : all transformations are required to preserve asymptotic flatness . usually , these boundary conditions involve fixing ( a trivialization of the spin - bundle and ) a flat @xmath13 soldering form at infinity , imposing conditions on the fall - off of @xmath41 , @xmath31 and matter fields and a requirement that the magnetic part of the weyl curvature should fall faster than the electric part",
    ". then , the asymptotic symmetry group reduces to the poincar group ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and the asymptotic limits of the permissible automorphisms in the bulk have to belong to this group . in this sub - section",
    ", we will discuss the analogous restrictions at @xmath91 .",
    "recall first that @xmath91 is foliated by a family of 2-spheres ( @xmath130 ) and a transversal direction field @xmath96 .",
    "the permissible diffeomorphisms are those which preserve this structure . hence , on @xmath91",
    ", these diffeomorphisms must be compositions of translations along the integral curves of @xmath96 and general diffeomorphisms on a 2-sphere in the foliation .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions reduce @xmath131 to a semi - direct product of the abelian group of `` translations '' generated by vector fields @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    ". we will refer to this group as @xmath134 .",
    "the situation with the internal @xmath13 rotations is more subtle .",
    "recall from section [ sec2.1 ] that the 1-form @xmath117 is tied to the preferred foliation : given a coordinate @xmath97 whose level surfaces correspond to the preferred foliation , we set @xmath135 .",
    "since the permissible changes in @xmath97 are of the type @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , the co - vector field @xmath138 is now unique up to rescalings @xmath139 . since @xmath140 are normalized via @xmath141 , @xmath91 is now equipped with a class of pairs @xmath142 unique up to rescalings @xmath143 ) .",
    "hence , given any history @xmath144 satisfying the boundary conditions , we have a spin - dyad @xmath145 unique up to rescalings [ gauge ] ( ^a , ^a ) = ( ( ) i^a , ( - ) ^a ) , where @xmath146 this suggests that we fix on @xmath91 a spin - dyad @xmath145 _ up to these rescalings _ and allow only those histories in which @xmath147 maps @xmath148 to one of the allowed pairs @xmath149 on @xmath91 .",
    "it is easy to check that this gauge - fixing can always be achieved .",
    "it reduces the group of local @xmath13 gauge transformations to complexified @xmath150 as in ( [ gauge ] ) .    as is easy to check , under these restricted internal rotations , the fields @xmath151 ( which determines the expansion of @xmath117 ) and @xmath152 ( which determine @xmath153 via ( [ a ] ) ) have the following gauge behavior : [ rescaling ] f(v ) ( re2 ) f(v ) , _ a_a+ _",
    "a,_a ( 2 ) _ a .",
    "thus , @xmath154 transforms as a connection while @xmath109 and @xmath155 transform as `` matter fields '' on which the connection acts .",
    "since @xmath109 and @xmath156 are both positive functions of @xmath97 alone , the transformation property of @xmath109 suggests that we further reduce the gauge freedom to @xmath150 by gauge - fixing @xmath109 .",
    "this is not essential but it does clarify the structure of the true degrees of freedom and frees us from keeping track of the awkward fact that @xmath156 depends only on @xmath97 while @xmath157 is an arbitrary function on @xmath91 as in local gauge theories .",
    "since @xmath151 has the dimensions of expansion ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) , and since the only ( universally defined ) quantity of the dimension of length is the horizon radius @xmath159 , it is natural to ask that @xmath109 be proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "furthermore , there is a remarkable fact : for all static black holes in the einstein - maxwell theory ( with standard normalization of the killing field ) , the expansion of @xmath117 is given by @xmath161 _ irrespective _ of the values of charges or of the cosmological constant , so that , in all these solutions , @xmath162 . this fact can be exploited to extend the definition of surface gravity to non - static black holes @xcite .",
    "although we will not use surface gravity in this paper or its companion @xcite , for uniformity , we will use the same gauge and set @xmath162 .",
    "as is clear from ( [ rescaling ] ) , this choice can always be made and furthermore exhausts the gauge freedom in the real part of @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the internal @xmath13 freedom now reduces to @xmath150 .",
    "we wish to emphasize however that none of the conclusions of this paper or @xcite depend on this choice ; indeed , we could have avoided gauge fixing altogether .",
    "let us summarize . with the gauge fixing we have chosen ,",
    "only those automorphisms of the @xmath13 spin - bundle in the bulk are permissible which ( reduce to identity at infinity and ) belong , on @xmath91 , to the semi - direct product of the local @xmath150 gauge group and @xmath164 . under @xmath150 gauge rotations ,",
    "the basic fields transform as follows : _ a _ a + i_a , _ a _ a , i^a ( i ) i^a , ^a(-i ) ^a , where @xmath165 .",

    "finally , @xmath188 has a simple geometric interpretation : the group of tangent - space rotations of @xmath176 is @xmath189 and @xmath188 is the natural spin - connection on the corresponding @xmath150-bundle .",

    ", curvature can be quite arbitrary due to the presence of gravitational radiation and matter fields .",

    "the soldering form @xmath41 , and hence the 2-forms @xmath28 , are required to approach their values in the background flat space as @xmath237 and the connection @xmath31 falls off as @xmath238 .",

    "the boundary degrees are typically connections and their dynamics is governed by the chern - simons action ( see , in particular , @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , in the present work we did not add new degrees of freedom at all .",
    "the chern - simons piece did arise because the naive action @xmath217 fails to admit a well - defined variational principle .",
    "however , the effect of the boundary conditions is to _ reduce _ the number of degrees of freedom : as usual , the boundary conditions impose relations between dynamical variables which are independent in the bulk . furthermore , unlike in other discussions , these conditions arose from detailed geometrical properties of null vector fields @xmath118 and @xmath117 associated with isolated horizons in general relativity .",
    "this is also a major difference from the discussion in @xcite where the chern simons action arose as a boundary term in _",
    "gravity subject to the condition that the spin - connection reduce to a right - handed @xmath14 connection on the boundary .",

    "it is not surprising that the action depends only on the abelian part @xmath182 of the @xmath13 connection @xmath153 since @xmath153 is completely determined by @xmath182 on our space of paths .",
    "however , it is pleasing that the functional dependence of the action on @xmath182 is simple , being just the chern - simons action for @xmath182 .",

    ", note that the smearing field @xmath262 does _ not _ have to vanish on @xmath176 ; it only has to be tangential to @xmath176 .",
    "the diffeomorphisms generated by all such vector fields @xmath294 are to be regarded as ` gauge ' transformations in this hamiltonian theory . note that asymptotic translations or rotations have well - defined action on the phase space but they are not generated by constraints and therefore are not regarded as gauge .",

    "this is not surprising since such diffeomorphisms do not even give rise to well - defined motions on the phase space .",

    "therefore , as in the case without internal boundaries @xcite , the constraint sub - manifold of the phase space is defined by the vanishing of the constraint functions @xmath297 where the smearing fields satisfy these conditions .",

    "the boundary conditions at the horizon specified in section [ sec3 ] allow a non - zero cosmological constant and matter fields are subject only to condition ( v ) in the main definition .",
    "once this condition is satisfied , the discussion of section [ sec4 ] goes through and is completely insensitive to the details of matter fields .",
    "however , in a complete theory , we also need to ensure that the matter action is differentiable and work out the hamiltonian framework for the matter sector as well .",
    "this can require imposition of additional boundary conditions on matter fields . in this section , we will incorporate maxwell and dilatonic fields .",
    "the einstein - maxwell case is discussed in section [ sec5.1 ] and the dilatonic case in section [ sec5.2 ] .",
    "since we require that field equations hold on @xmath91 , the gravitational boundary conditions already imply certain restrictions on the behavior of maxwell fields there .",

    "the gauge transformations in the hamiltonian framework are the maxwell @xmath313 gauge rotations .",
    "the hamiltonian can be read off from the legendre transforms of the action given above .",
    "in this paper , we introduced the notion of a non - rotating isolated horizon , constructed an action which yields einstein s equations for histories admitting these horizons , and obtained a hamiltonian framework in terms of real @xmath73-valued fields .",
    "we found that there is a surprising and interesting interplay between the space - time boundary conditions satisfied by isolated horizons @xmath91 and the chern - simons theory for a @xmath416 connection on @xmath91 .",
    "the gravitational part of boundary conditions , the corresponding action and the phase space framework could be discussed in the general case , without committing oneself to specific matter fields . in addition",
    ", we discussed in detail the boundary conditions , action and the hamiltonian formulation for maxwell and dilaton fields .",
    "this detailed framework has five parameters : as the fundamental parameter and expresses area @xmath204 in terms of @xmath8 and other charges .",
    "by contrast , we regard @xmath204 as the basic parameter and @xmath8 as a secondary quantity derived from hamiltonian considerations @xcite .",
    "thus , all our parameters including charges in the dilatonic case are defined directly at the horizon , without reference to infinity .",
    "this is particularly important for cosmological horizons where @xmath8 may not even be defined ! in this case , we will be still be able to account for the entropy @xcite.]the cosmological constant @xmath15 , the horizon area @xmath204 , the electric and magnetic charges @xmath331 and @xmath332 , and the dilaton charge @xmath394 . since our primary motivation is to present a hamiltonian framework that will serve as a point of departure for the entropy calculation of a quantum black hole in @xcite , in this paper we worked with sectors of the theory in which all these charges are fixed .",
    "a more general discussion is necessary to extend the laws of black hole mechanics to isolated horizons and is given in @xcite .    in the final phase space framework , the basic variables consist of pairs , @xmath83 of @xmath73-valued forms as in the simpler case without internal boundaries .",
    "however , they are now subject to boundary conditions not only at infinity but also on the internal boundary @xmath176 representing the isolated horizon : on @xmath176 , the independent information in @xmath417 is contained in the ( @xmath76 independent ) @xmath418 connection @xmath182 whose curvature @xmath185 is proportional to @xmath419 ( see ( [ calf ] ) ) .",
    "of particular interest is the interplay between various fields at @xmath176 . in the gravitational sector , the boundary conditions fix neither the soldering form @xmath41 nor the connection @xmath31 on @xmath176 but rather a _ relation _ between them , namely ( [ calf ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "quantum theory will allow fluctuations in both these fields but they will be intertwined by the quantum analog of ( [ calf ] ) . in the matter sector , on the other hand , the dynamical fields on @xmath176 are completely determined by the values of charges and geometry more precisely , the field @xmath201 of @xmath176 .",
    "this will turn out to be the key reason why the entropy depends only on the area @xmath204 of @xmath176 , independently of the matter content .",
    "finally , we saw that the presence of the horizon modifies symplectic structure : in addition to the standard bulk term , there is now a surface term which coincides with the symplectic structure of a @xmath416 chern - simons theory for @xmath182 ( see ( [ omega ] ) ) .",
    "this feature will also play a key role in the quantization of the theory in @xcite .",
    "the isolated horizons introduced here are special cases of hayward s trapping horizons @xcite in that we require that the expansion of @xmath118 should vanish ( and @xmath117 to satisfy certain restrictions . )",
    "this condition on @xmath118 was necessary for us because , for entropy considerations , we wish to focus on isolated horizons . while there are several similarities between the two sets of analyses , there are also important differences in the motivation and hence also in the subsequent developments .",

    "by contrast , we are primarily interested in the interface of general relativity , statistical mechanics and quantum field theory . therefore , we focus on equilibrium situations and wish to incorporate not only black holes but also cosmological horizons ( as well as other situations such as those depicted in figure 2 ) which are of importance in this context .",
    "finally , because of our further restrictions on @xmath118 and @xmath117 , we were able to obtain an action principle and construct a detailed hamiltonian framework which is necessary for quantization .",
    "there are two directions in which our framework could be extended .",
    "first , one should weaken the boundary conditions and carry out the subsequent analysis to allow for rotation . as indicated in section [ sec3.1 ] , only conditions ( iv.b ) and ( v.b ) in the main definition",
    "have to be weakened .",
    "recent results of lewandowski @xcite have paved way for this task .",
    "second , already in the non - rotating case , one could allow horizons which are distorted , e.g. , because the presence of a cage around the black hole .",
    "it may not be possible to introduce an action principle and a complete hamiltonian framework in this case since the matter fields involved are not fundamental .",
    "however , it should still be possible to introduce appropriate boundary conditions , work out their consequences and explore generalizations of the laws of black hole mechanics .",
    "the second type of extension involves going from general relativity to more general , higher derivative theories . in these cases ,",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath91 would be the same but there would be some differences in their consequences arising from the differences in the field equations . the action principle and the hamiltonian framework would be significantly different",
    ". however , it should be possible to carry out the required extension in a tetrad framework @xcite . this would provide an interesting generalization of wald s analysis @xcite based on noether charges of stationary solutions .",
