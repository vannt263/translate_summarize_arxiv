    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are well described by the blast wave , or fireball , model @xcite , which details their temporal and spectral behaviour . in this model grb afterglow emission",
    "is created by shocks when a collimated ultra - relativistic jet ploughs into the circumburst medium , driving a blast wave ahead of it .",
    "this causes a non - thermal spectrum widely accepted to be synchrotron emission , with characteristic power - law slopes and spectral break frequencies .",
    "the signature of the collimation is an achromatic temporal steepening or ` jet break ' at @xmath0 day in an otherwise decaying , power - law light curve .",
    "the level of collimation , or jet opening angle , has important implications for the energetics of the underlying physical process .",
    "since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , this standard picture has been called into question by the rich and novel phenomena discovered in the both the early and late light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we focus on the perceived lack of achromatic temporal breaks in the _ swift _ era , up to weeks in some bursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which calls into question the effects of collimation and therefore the energy requirements of progenitor models .",
    "some bursts show no evidence for breaks in either optical or x - ray , while others show clear breaks in one regime without any apparent accompanying break in the other . even in those bursts where an achromatic break is observed ,",
    "they may not be consistent with a jet break as predicted by the blast wave model ( e.g. , grb060124 , @xcite ) .",
    "we should note that our expectations of the observable signature of a jet break , including the fact that it ought to be perfectly achromatic , is based on highly simplified models , notably those of @xcite and @xcite , and break observations , pre-_swift _ , that were based predominately in one regime ( i.e. , optical ) .",
    "so apart from well sampled multi - regime observations , more realistic models and simulations of the light curves , beyond the scope of this letter , will also be required to settle this issue .",
    "as the apparent lack of observed achromatic breaks is an important issue in the _ swift _ era , we will discuss the perceived presence and absence of these achromatic breaks , using the long burst grb060206 as an illustrative example .",
    "we present our multi - wavelength analysis of the well sampled afterglow from x - ray to optical wavelengths . in ",
    "[ section : observations ] we introduce our observations while in  [ section : results ] we present the results of our temporal and spectral analyses . in  [ section : discussion ] we discuss these results in the overall context of the blast wave model of grbs and we summarise our findings in  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "throughout , we use the convention that a power - law flux is given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temporal decay index and @xmath3 is the spectral index .",
    "all errors and uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "optical observations in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands were obtained at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) and 3.6 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) on la palma , the 1.5 m observatorio de sierra nevada ( osn ) in granada , spain , the 1.8 m astrophysical observatory of asiago , italy and the 2.0 m faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) at haleakala , hawaii ( table [ optical_log ] ) .",
    "the optical counterpart was identified in initial @xmath7 band frames , however no counterpart was detected in the @xmath5 band frames , in agreement with the significant level of line blanketing associated with the lyman forest at a redshift of @xmath9 @xcite : the fluxes of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands are reduced to 8 , 50 and 88 per cent , respectively , of their true values @xcite .",
    "the field was calibrated via a standard @xcite field taken by the osn on a photometric night .",
    "differential photometry was carried out relative to a number of stars within @xmath10 of the burst , with resulting deviations less than the individual errors .",
    "the photometric calibration error is included in error estimates .",
    "we combine our @xmath7 band data with that already published from the raptor & mdm telescopes ( @xcite ; where mdm was shifted @xmath11 magnitudes as in @xcite ) to extend the optical light curve past @xmath12s since trigger .",
    ".optical observations of grb060206 .",
    "magnitudes are given with @xmath4 errors or as @xmath13 limits . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < \" , ]     two optical spectral indices are found by fitting the optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at @xmath14s and @xmath15s ( i.e. , pre- and post - break ) .",
    "for the pre - break analysis we use the near - infrared data ( @xmath16 ) of @xcite and the shifted @xmath7 band data , at that time , of @xcite .",
    "for the post - break sed we use our @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 band data .",
    "all data were converted to fluxes and corrected for galactic extinction of @xmath17 @xcite and line blanketing due to the lyman forest .",
    "we find optical spectral indices of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for pre- and post - break , respectively .",
    "to constrain these values further we use the simultaneous x - ray and optical fitting detailed in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the optical to x - ray sed is fit in count - space , incorporating the measured metallicity @xcite and including the effect host galaxy extinction .",
    "the above optical data points were augmented by x - ray data at the given times : the pre - break sed by one orbit of xrt data and the post - break sed by @xmath20 seconds of data . from this",
    "we find that both epochs are well described by a single spectral power - law with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , in agreement with each other and with our previous values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 but inconsistent with the interpretation of a possible spectral change in the optical between the two epochs .",
    "these results are shown in table [ indices ] and agree , within errors , with those of @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the well sampled x - ray afterglow can be described by a single power - law decay , though a broken power - law , which gives temporal indices and a break time similar to those in the optical , is as good a fit .",
    "while it is difficult to accommodate the single power - law decay in the framework of the blast wave model , an achromatic broken power - law decay can be interpreted in terms of a jet break or an energy injection break , which we will now discuss in the context of the blast wave model ( for a review and mathematical relations see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral indices of the optical to x - ray spectrum are constant before and after the optical break , i.e. , at @xmath25 and @xmath26hours with the break at @xmath27hours ( @xmath28hours in the rest frame ) after the burst .",
    "this indicates that the temporal break is not caused by the passage of a break frequency through the optical regime in the broadband spectrum .",
    "the conclusion one can draw from this is that the break is caused by a change in the dynamics of the jet , e.g. , the cessation of the energy injection phase or the beginning of the jet - spreading phase ( the jet break interpretation ) . assuming that the optical and x - ray emission is caused by the same mechanism , the x - ray light curve is expected to show a break at the same time as the optical .",
    "we note that @xcite ascribe the dynamical change of the blast wave to a change in the circumburst density profile , the blast wave breaking out of a homogeneous medium into a stellar wind like environment .",
    "this model agrees with the observed spectral and temporal slopes but is not expected from the immediate environment models of grb progenitors which predicts a transition from a wind like to a homogeneous medium , and not the converse ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we explore the two possible explanations we propose for the seds and light curves of the afterglow of this burst , a jet break and an energy injection break .      from the sed spectral indices the power - law index of the electron energy distribution , @xmath29 , can be determined . for both possible explanations",
    "the interpretation of the seds is the same , in that the single power - law sed from optical to x - rays is either in between the peak frequency , @xmath30 and the cooling frequency , @xmath31 , or above both frequencies . in the first case @xmath32 , while in the latter case @xmath33 , using the spectral slopes from the optical to x - ray fit in count - space at @xmath34hours after the burst .    in the jet break interpretation of the achromatic break",
    ", the blast wave is moving ultra - relativistically , but decelerating , before the break .",
    "when the lorentz factor of the blast wave drops below the inverse half opening angle of the jet , the observer starts to see the whole jet and the jet begins to spread sideways , giving rise to the so - called jet break . if both the x - ray and optical regimes are situated between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the temporal slope before the break , given the value of @xmath29 derived from the sed , is @xmath35 or @xmath36 , for a homogeneous or a stellar wind environment , respectively .",
    "the post - break slope would then be @xmath37 .",
    "all these slopes are too steep compared to the observed temporal slopes . if , however , both observing regimes are above @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the pre - break slope is @xmath38 , while the post - break slope is @xmath39 .",
    "the pre - break slope in this case is consistent with the observed slopes .",
    "the observed post - break slopes are slightly shallower than expected , but they are consistent within @xmath13 , though further steepening to an asymptotic value of @xmath40 can not be ruled out . to conclude ,",
    "in the jet break interpretation we find that @xmath33 and @xmath41 , but we can not say anything about the structure of the circumburst medium , i.e. , homogeneous or wind , since that requires that the observing frequencies are below @xmath31 .",
    "if the achromatic break is interpreted as the cessation of an extended energy injection phase , the post - break slopes are given by the expressions for an ultra - relativistic blast wave .",
    "in this case , if both observing frequencies are situated in between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the temporal slopes after the break are @xmath35 ( homogeneous medium ) or @xmath36 ( stellar wind ) .",
    "if both observing frequencies are situated above the spectral break frequencies , the temporal slope is @xmath38 , regardless of the circumburst medium structure .",
    "comparing these numbers with the observed post - break slopes , the observations are best fit when @xmath42 and hence @xmath32 , and the ambient medium is homogeneous .",
    "assuming that the energy injection can be described as @xmath43 , the flattening of the light curves before the break is given by @xmath44 , which gives @xmath45 from the observed average flattening of @xmath46 .      in general , the jet break time is related to the half opening angle of the jet , from which the isotropic equivalent energy can be converted into the collimation corrected energy .",
    "if we interpret the achromatic break at @xmath27hours as a jet break , the half opening angle of the jet is found to be @xmath47 or @xmath48 , for a homogeneous medium or a stellar wind environment , respectively @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the energy injection interpretation , the observations indicate that there has not been a jet break up to @xmath49days after the burst , which results in a lower limit on the jet half opening angle of @xmath50 . in all these expressions for the opening angle , @xmath51 is the isotropic equivalent blast wave energy in units of @xmath52 ergs ; @xmath53 is the homogeneous circumburst medium density in @xmath54 ; and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the mass - loss rate in @xmath57 m@xmath58 per year and @xmath59 the stellar wind velocity in @xmath60kms@xmath61 .",
    "these typical values for the energy and density @xcite are in agreement with the constraints on the values for @xmath30 and @xmath31 compared to the observing frequencies .",
    "also the fractional energies of radiating electrons and magnetic field , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , have typical values of @xmath64 , although in the energy injection interpretation @xmath65 , which has been found for other bursts . with these opening angles",
    "we can convert the isotropic equivalent gamma - ray energy of @xmath66ergs @xcite into collimation corrected energies of @xmath67erg for the jet break interpretation and @xmath68ergs for the energy injection interpretation , consistent with the energy distribution of other bursts @xcite .",
    "many previously studied jet breaks do not display sharp changes in the temporal decay index , but a shallow roll - over from asymptotic values which is described by a smoothly broken power - law .",
    "the prototypical example of such a break is grb990510 for which well sampled @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 band light curves display an achromatic break ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is accepted as a jet break even though the x - ray light curve as measured by _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite is satisfactorily described by a single power - law .",
    "a break at x - ray frequencies at the same time as the optical break is however , not ruled out and the temporal slopes before and after that break are similar in the optical and x - rays . in the analysis of grb060206 we are seeing the same phenomenon :",
    "the optical light curve displays a break , while the x - ray is satisfactorily described by a single power - law fit , though a broken power - law is not ruled out .",
    "however , an x - ray break is necessary to explain the afterglow when interpreting it in the context of the standard blast wave model .",
    "a similar issue has been addressed in sed fits by @xcite , where adding a cooling break to some seds gives only a marginal improvement according to the statistical f - test , but is necessitated by considerations of the physical model .",
    "this has significant implications for the analysis of the myriad of x - ray light curves that the _ swift _ satellite has afforded us . for those x - ray light curves extending up to @xmath0day or longer , for which we do not have well sampled optical light curves , caution is required when making claims about the absence of breaks in isolation , without considering physical interpretations .",
    "this is particularly important when performing statistical analyses on a large sample of temporal and spectral slopes , for making collimation corrected energy estimates , and for using grbs as standard candles .",
    "we identify a possible achromatic break in the x - ray and optical light curves of grb060206 at @xmath27hours , which is most successfully explained by a change in the dynamics of the jet : either as a jet break or a break due to the cessation of energy injection .",
    "neither is favoured as both are consistent with the blast wave model and the distribution of collimation corrected energies .",
    "the presence of a weak constant source near the afterglow in both x - rays and optical precludes , in this case , an examination of the light curves later than @xmath69s .",
    "grb060206 was , up to now , assumed to have a chromatic break ( i.e. , a break only in the optical ) since the x - ray data alone does not require a break .",
    "however , examining all x - ray and optical data until late times , we find that the optical and x - ray light curves are consistent with having the same break time and pre- and post - break temporal slopes .",
    "there is also no evidence of chromaticity from a comparison of pre- and post - break seds that encompass optical and x - ray data",
    ".    we should therefore be cautious in ruling out breaks as being achromatic from comparing the nominal fitted slopes .",
    "this issue is important for determining true grb energies , but also has a strong bearing on recent attempts to use grbs for determining the geometry of the distant universe .",
    "that said , there does seem to be a tendency , if not yet strongly significant , for the x - ray light curves to have less pronounced breaks .",
    "both 060206 and 990510 , the achromatic break ` poster child ' , are examples of this",
    ". it would therefore be worthwhile to extend the sample of _ swift _ bursts that have well sampled late - time optical light curves , which would be helped by finding more afterglows in the anti - sun direction .",
    "also , more detailed theoretical models of jet breaks ( likely involving numerical simulations of the jet dynamics ) should be preformed to clarify whether jet breaks could vary somewhat between wavebands .",
