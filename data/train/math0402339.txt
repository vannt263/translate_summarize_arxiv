    "<S> we show that the manifolds in @xmath2 are hyperbolic ( with geodesic boundary , and cusps corresponding to the loops ) , have least possible volume , and simplest boundary loops .    mirroring the elements of @xmath2 in their geodesic boundary we obtain a set @xmath4 of cusped hyperbolic manifolds , previously considered by d.  thurston and the first named author . </S>",
    "<S> we show that also @xmath4 corresponds bijectively to @xmath0 , and we study some dehn fillings of the manifolds in @xmath4 . as consequences of our constructions </S>",
    "<S> , we also show that :    * a triangulation of a 3-manifold is uniquely determined up to isotopy by its 1-skeleton ; * if a 3-manifold @xmath5 has an ideal triangulation with edges of valence at least @xmath6 , then @xmath5 is hyperbolic and the edges are homotopically non - trivial , whence homotopic to geodesics ; * every finite group @xmath7 is the isometry group of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold with volume less than @xmath8 .    </S>",
