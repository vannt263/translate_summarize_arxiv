    "naturally , this procedure works for tree graphs which are not path graphs as well - at the end of each run , we start over by painting some blank vertex adjacent to some colored vertex , until all vertices are colored - and indeed the formula above counts the number of distinct @xmath22-fold @xmath1-colorings on all tree graphs .",
    "+ using the same procedure to count the number of @xmath0-fold @xmath1-colorings ( @xmath61 choices on the initial vertex and @xmath62 choices on the remaining vertices ) we then obtain ( 5 ) .",

    "in section 1 , we mentioned that the recurrence relations of the fundamental reduction theorem did not extend to fractional colorings , but we did not demonstrate it .",
    "we will do so now .",
