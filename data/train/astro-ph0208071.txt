    "in a recent important paper cussons , langanke , & liolios ( 2002 ) have pointed out the potential resonant screening effects on stellar @xmath0c + @xmath0c reaction rates .",
    "the @xmath0c + @xmath0c fusion cross sections show noticeable resonant structures down to the lowest energies measured so far in the laboratory @xmath1 mev ( kettner , lorenz - wirzba , & rolfs 1980 ) .",
    "if the resonant structure continues to even lower energies and the astrophysical reaction rate is due to the contributions of narrow resonances , one then has to consider that the entrance channel width of these resonances will be modified in the plasma .",
    "cussons , langanke , & liolios ( 2002 ) have specifically pointed out the possible importance of the plasma effects on the resonant @xmath0c + @xmath0c reactions for a carbon white dwarf environment with @xmath2 k and @xmath3 g @xmath4 .",
    "they have considered a resonance energy interval 0.4@xmath52 mev .",
    "they have specifically discussed a rather extreme case of the low resonance energy @xmath6 = 400 kev and have estimated the overall enhancement of the resonant @xmath0c + @xmath0c reaction rates due to the plasma effects for this case .",
    "cussons , langanke , & liolios ( 2002 ) adopted the method of salpeter & van horn ( 1969 ) which is based on the lattice model of the dense plasma to calculate the resonant screening effects .",
    "one of the present authors ( n. i. ) and his collaborators have calculated the enhancement of non - resonant thermonuclear reaction rates in extremely dense stellar plasmas ( itoh , kuwashima , & munakata 1990 ) .",
    "this work is a natural extension of the works of itoh , totsuji , & ichimaru ( 1977 ) and itoh et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , and improves upon the accuracy of the results of salpeter & van horn ( 1969 ) .",
    "itoh , kuwashima , & munakata ( 1990 ) have summarized their numerical results by an accurate analytical fitting formula which will be readily implemented in the stellar evolution computations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the work of itoh , kuwashima , & munakata ( 1990 ) to the case of resonant reactions .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "physical conditions relevant to the present calculation are made explicit in   2 .",
    "calculation of the enhancement factor of the resonant thermonuclear reaction rates is summarized in   3 .",
    "the results are presented in   4 .",
    "extension to the case of ionic mixtures is made in   5 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in ",
    "first we consider thermonuclear reactions which take place in the plasma in the thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature @xmath7 composed of one kind of atomic nuclei and electrons with number densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the electric charge and the mass of such an ion .",
    "the conventional parameters which characterize such a plasma are @xmath12^{1/3 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the ion - sphere radius @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the mass number of the nucleus , @xmath16 is the temperature in units of 10@xmath17 k , and @xmath18 is the mass density in units of 10@xmath19 g @xmath4 . in this paper we restrict ourselves to the case that electrons are strongly degenerate .",
    "this condition is expressed as @xmath20 \\ ,   { \\rm k } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the electron fermi temperature .",
    "furthermore , we consider the case that the ions can be treated approximately as classical particles . the corresponding condition is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the thermal de broglie wave length of the ions .",
    "the condition ( 2.4 ) is rewritten as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass density in units of 10@xmath26 g @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we impose a further condition that the ions are in the liquid state ( slattery , doolen , & dewitt 1982 ) : @xmath27    the parameter 3@xmath28 corresponds to the ratio of the classical turning point radius at the gamow peak and the mean interionic distance in the case of the pure coulomb potential ( itoh , totsuji , & ichimaru 1977 ; alastuey & jancovici 1978 ) .",
    "the theories of itoh , totsuji , & ichimaru ( 1977 ) , itoh et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and also alastuey & jancovici ( 1978 ) are valid under the condition 3@xmath29 .",
    "itoh , kuwashima , & munakata ( 1990 ) have extended the calculation of the enhancement of the non - resonant thermonuclear reaction rates to the case 3@xmath30 . in figure  1",
    "we show the density - temperature diagram of the pure @xmath0c plasma which illustrates the physical conditions described in this section .",
    "in this paper we use the following screening potential for the classical one - component plasma @xmath31 \\ , , \\ ,   \\hspace{1.0 cm } \\ , 0 \\leq r \\leq r_{0 }   \\\\",
    "h(r ) & = & \\frac{z^{2}e^{2}}{a } \\left [ 1.25 - \\left ( \\frac{1.25}{2 } \\right)^{2 } \\ , \\frac{r}{a } \\right ] \\ , , \\ , \\hspace{2.5 cm } \\ ,   r_{0 } \\leq r \\leq 1.60 a   \\\\ c & = & 1.0531 \\ , \\gamma + 2.2931 \\ , \\gamma^{1/4 } - 0.5551 \\ , \\ln \\gamma - 2.35 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this screening potential is derived from the equilibrium pair correlation function of the classical one - component plasma . in adopting this screening potential",
    ", our standpoint is the same as that of alastuey & jancovici ( 1978 ) .",
    "they have argued that the pair correlation function should be taken as the static one .",
    "the point is that the transmission coefficient of the potential barrier is exceedingly small , which makes nuclear reactions very rare events . in a loose classical analogy",
    ", one might say that , in most collisions , the colliding particles tunnel through only a certain distance and are then reflected back .",
    "therefore , as soon as @xmath32 is larger than a few nuclear diameters , equilibrium is achieved and the probability of finding two nuclei at a distance @xmath32 from one another is given by the equilibrium pair correlation function .",
    "thus one can use the averaged potential in describing the tunnelling .",
    "more recently dewitt ( 1994 ) , rosenfeld ( 1994 ) , and isern & hernanz ( 1994 ) have studied this problem .",
    "they have essentially confirmed the correctness of the method of alastuey & jancovici ( 1978 ) on which our work is based .",
    "a similar work in the case of the solar fusion reactions has been recently carried out by bahcall et al .",
    "( 2002 ) essentially confirming the soundness of the method of the average potential .",
    "we also remark in relaion to the above - stated point that the nuclear reactions as a whole are taking place on the macroscopic time scale , whereas the screening potential is kept in equilibrium on the microscopic time scale .",
    "we here remark on the validity of the classical one - component plasma ( ocp ) model . in the interior of dense stars",
    "the electron fermi energy becomes much larger than the coulomb interaction energy between the electron and the ion .",
    "therefore , the electron liquid becomes an almost uniform liquid .",
    "owing to this fact , the interior of dense stars can be satisfactorily described by the ocp model which consists of point ions imbedded in the rigid background of electrons .",
    "of course , at the same density the ocp model becomes better for the smaller ionic charge @xmath33 , as the ratio of the electron - ion interaction energy to the electron fermi energy becomes smaller for the smaller @xmath33 .",
    "the expression for @xmath34 is taken from alastuey and jancovici ( 1978 ) .",
    "the two segments of the screening potential are matched at @xmath35 so that the screening potential and its derivative be a continuous function with respect to the distance @xmath32 .",
    "this procedure produces solutions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the range of @xmath38-values @xmath39 . outside this range",
    "we use the value of @xmath37 which makes ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) continuous at @xmath32=1.171875@xmath13 . in this case",
    "the first derivatives of ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) are slightly discontinuous at this point .",
    "the linearly decreasing part of the screening potential is identical to that employed by itoh , totsuji , & ichimaru ( 1977 ) and also by itoh et al .",
    "the screening potential ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) fits the results of the numerical experiments excellently .",
    "( see figure  1 of itoh et al .",
    "( 1979 ) for the accuracy of this screening potential in reproducing the results of the monte carlo computations . )",
    "note that this screening potential exactly cancels the coulomb potential @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "we further assume that the potential of mean force vanishes for @xmath42 .",
    "given the explicit form of the screening potential , we are now in a position to calculate the enhancement of the resonant thermonuclear reaction rates .",
    "a single resonance in the cross section of a nuclear reaction @xmath43 can be represented most simply as a function of energy in terms of the classical breit - wigner formula ( fowler , caughlan , & zimmerman 1967 ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the reduced mass , @xmath46 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath6 is the resonance energy , @xmath47 is the statistical weight factor , @xmath48 is the partial width for the decay of the resonant state by reemission of @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the partial width for emission of @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the sum over all partial widths .",
    "the partial width @xmath48 is proportional to the barrier penetration factor @xmath53 for the screened coulomb potential .",
    "@xmath54^{1/2 } dr \\right\\ } \\ , ,   \\\\",
    "v(r ) & = & \\frac{z^{2}e^{2}}{r } - h(r ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the classical turning point radius which satisfies the condition @xmath56    we consider the case that the resonance is sharp ; that is , the full width at resonance , @xmath57 , is considerably smaller than the effective spread in energy of the interacting particles .",
    "we further consider the case @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "cussons , langanke , & liolios ( 2002 ) have pointed out that for @xmath0c + @xmath0c resonances far below the height of the coulomb barrier , the entrance channel width @xmath48 is much smaller than the total resonance width .",
    "the latter ( which is of order @xmath60 100 kev for the observed resonances above 2.4 mev ) is also noticeably smaller than the resonance energy . in this case",
    "we have ( fowler , caughlan , & zimmerman 1967 ) @xmath61 therefore the partial width @xmath48 in equation ( 3.5 ) is to be evaluated at the resonance energy @xmath62 . here",
    "we notice that the resonance energy is shifted by the plasma effects .",
    "we take @xmath6 to be the shifted resonance energy .",
    "the shifted resonance energy @xmath6 is related to the resonance energy in the vacuum @xmath63 by the relationship @xmath64 where the expression for @xmath34 is given by equation ( 3.3 ) .",
    "the barrier penetration factor @xmath65 for the pure coulomb potential @xmath40 of the identical nuclei is known to be @xmath66^{1/2 } \\frac { \\pi}{2 } \\frac{1 } { \\sqrt { \\epsilon } }   \\right\\ } \\ , ,   \\\\ \\epsilon & = & \\frac{a e}{z^{2}e^{2 } }   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the enhancement factor @xmath67 of the resonant thermonuclear reaction rates which arises because of the plasma screening effects is @xmath68^{1/2 } \\left [ - \\frac { \\pi}{2 } \\frac{1 } { \\sqrt { \\epsilon_{r}^{0 } } } +   j(\\gamma , \\epsilon_{r } ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\exp ( c ) \\",
