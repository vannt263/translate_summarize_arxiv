    "a considerable number of fundamental works have been devoted to tackling the superconductivity ( sc ) problem and , in particular , a high temperature superconductivity one ( htsc ) .",
    "the opinion on the present state of the problem may be formed considering the works  @xcite .",
    "most relevant publication are to some extent associated with the bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "now , for metals enumerated in the periodic system of elements ( pse ) , the superconductivity theory is considered to be more or less completed and the validity of the bcs theory leaves no room for doubt on the part of the majority of authors . at the same time in",
    "@xcite a conclusion was drawn that the bcs theory may be not the only possible way to explain the phenomenon of sc .",
    "outstanding results  @xcite obtained by bednortz j.g . and muller a.k . in 1986 for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 caused the great sensation among chemists , physisists and material researchers . since that time the highest value for @xmath3 at about 164k was observed in hgca@xmath0ba@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath4 ceramics .",
    "there are grounds available highlighting a possibility of observing high @xmath3 in intercalates and nanotubes  @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "an increase in the value of @xmath3 and the observation of htsc are very plausible in high - pressure ( hp ) phases .",
    "almost twenty - five years ago , sc was reported to have been observed in auga@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "comparatively high values of @xmath3 were observed in fullerenes , hp phases with respect to graphite , and their derivatives fullerides c@xmath6 m  @xcite , where m stands for k , rb , cs .",
    "the idea of obtaining htsc in hp phases of li@xmath1p or li@xmath1n is at present at the stage of being accepted  @xcite . in the last publications on this topic",
    ", sc is investigated in a hp phase of mgb@xmath5  @xcite . in conjunction with the problem under consideration",
    ", we also ca nt help mentioning a hypothetical phase of metallic hydrogen  @xcite and nitrogen ( a private communication ) .",
    "the obtained results , especially the identification of htsc with the values of @xmath7 , are rather inconsistent with both the predictions of the bcs theory proper  @xcite , which had been made before discovering htsc , and any of its complimentary modifications , among which the theory of bipolarons has to be singled out  @xcite . in connection with this",
    ", we note that most htsc materials in stoichiometic phase are , strictly speaking , dielectrics , whose conductivity is fully determined by low concentrations of electroactive defects , whereas the theory of bipolarons gives low values of @xmath3 as the fermi level approaches the edges of zones .",
    "thus , it does not explain htsc for the aforementioned class of compounds .    in russia , one usually considers the results of microscopic calculations are in good agreement with the predictions of the bcs theory , including the case of htsc  @xcite as well .",
    "there is also another viewpoint which is doubtful about the reliability of any fine calculation performed by and large within the scope of the zone theory  @xcite .",
    "the problem is that a lot of poorly substantiated approximations did appear for the years of the existence of the zone theory . among these , for instance , the procedure of accounting for the screening effects seems to be quite harmless .",
    "these approximations were introduced by virtue of quite relevant reasons associated with an insufficient quick operation of computer equipment to perform strict calculations of the zone structure of metals , including that of the periodic system .",
    "the application of these procedures , however , renders the calculation of the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) constants quite an unpredictable operation , depending only on theoretical preferences of a specialist in the field of zone computations .    from our viewpoint ,",
    "the main source of difficulties consists in that all the calculations associated with epi pursue the goal of reducing the hamiltonian of the system to the frhlich form .",
    "it has been known for a long time  @xcite that the frhlich model does not allow a consistent accounting for the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) , because the coulomb interaction can not still be reasonably separated into that already accounted for in the initial values of frhlich hamiltonian constants , and that which will thereafter show up in the renormalization of the initial phonons owing to epi .",
    "accordingly , all the microscopic calculations of the epi constants are , strictly speaking , inconsistent .",
    "just these considerations underlied the need of a revision of the fundamentals of the sc theory , which was undertaken in studies  @xcite .",
    "it was shown the attraction between electrons exists in a long - wave range due to an exchange of virtual phonons .",
    "this question was not discussed in earlier works ( for example ,  @xcite ) devoted to the problem being tackled .",
    "we believe this was due to the following two basic causes .",
    "first , in the framework of `` procedure to account for the screening effects '' the function of the permittivity of electronic plasma was incorrectly used for the removal of `` undesirable '' singularities from the matrix elements of epi in the long - wave limit .",
    "second , the simplified form of the effective eei used in study  @xcite did not suppose substantial differences in the electron interaction both in the vicinity of the fermi surface and far off it .",
    "the authors of  @xcite well understood the disadvantages of the aforementioned approaches .",
    "remind that in  @xcite serious forebodings were caused just by these approximations , which gave rise to a detailed discussion .",
    "moreover , an idea was put forward that in a further development of the `` jelly '' model one should have refrained from the use of ion - plasma oscillations as initiating phonons .",
    "the accounting for just these remarks underlied the investigation in the long - wave range of eei , which had been undertaken in our studies  @xcite , where the oscillations of the valent skeleton serve as initiating phonons .",
    "it was shown the adequate inclusion of the phonon ",
    "phonon interaction in the examination process enables one to avoid the application of poorly substantiated procedures to `` account for the screening effects '' . and",
    "finally , the eei potential was calculated without any limitations as to its form .",
    "it was shown that the unitary transformation effected in the framework of the model suggested in  @xcite can reduce the hamiltonian of the electronic system of an indefinite monoatomic metal to the following form ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 and for @xmath10 at @xmath11 we have @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the electron charge , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are operators of the creation and annihilation of electrons with a momentum @xmath18 , respectively ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 are spin indices , @xmath21 is the permittivity of the valent skeleton , @xmath22 is the mass of ion , @xmath23 is the mass of a zone electron , @xmath24 is the number of conductivity electrons per elementary cell ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the value of fermi vector , and @xmath28 is the sound velocity .",
    "the potential of the form  ( [ eq-3 ] ) leads to an instability relative to the formation of electron pairs . in distinction from the bcs theory ,",
    "the momenta of electron couples are different from zero , while the couples bonding energy @xmath29 if a typical relationship @xmath30 for sc systems is fulfilled , may be estimated as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath33 , and this is consistent with the observations of an isotopic effect in a series of metals  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the coherence length @xmath34 .",
    "the further discussion will be carried out for the final system - a cubic crystal @xmath35 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "consider in the framework of eqs .",
    "( [ eq-1])-  ( [ eq-3 ] ) a wave function of the bound state of an electron pair with a minimum energy .",
    "its state will obviously be s - type . with increasing @xmath28 , its wave function will first become hydrogen - like , and",
    "then delta - like , so that at @xmath36 it proves to be possible to derive for the state @xmath37 of an electron couple with a momentum @xmath38 at an accuracy of up to the normalizing factor the following expression : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a discrete delta - shaped function , which is determined as follows : @xmath41    hence , it follows that in finite crystal , at least in the limit under consideration @xmath36 , the occupation numbers remain good quantum numbers in describing the states with the maximum bonding energy .",
    "a possibility arises to account for these states in the fermi - liquid theory by introducing a delta - shaped correction to the landau function . for the sake of simplification ,",
    "we assume its regular part may be accounted for by introducing a weak temperature dependence of the electron mass .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system will then become @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the operators of the occupation numbers , @xmath44 .",
    "the hamiltonian so written is able of correctly describing both the statistics and the energy spectrum of one- and two - particle excitations .",
    "the existence of the bound multiparticle states of electrons , for which , like for the considered s - state as well , the occupation numbers remain to be good quantum numbers in the limit @xmath36 , is accounted for by introducing the dependence of @xmath45 on the occupation density @xmath46 : @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq-8 ] ) , the symmetry of the bonding energy between electrons with @xmath48 and holes with @xmath49 , which is rather approximate in real systems , has been accounted for .    in the mean field approximation",
    ", the fermi - dirac distribution function is expressed through the local energy of a quasi - particle @xmath50 , and a self - consistency equation for the occupation density is as follows ( @xmath51 ) :    @xmath52    @xmath53^{-1}\\ ] ] @xmath54    the evolution of a one - electron spectrum of the system with its temperature varying becomes obvious from fig .",
    "1 . at high temperatures ,",
    "this spectrum is described by an ordinary parabola ; and at @xmath55 the spectrum exhibits a peculiar feature which , at @xmath56 , transforms into a gap .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath3 may be estimated by the equation @xmath57 .",
    "then we derive for @xmath3 @xmath58    so , the sc condensate is formed by electrons with the energy @xmath59 at @xmath56 .",
    "the couples of electrons with momenta @xmath60 or holes with @xmath61 in a superconducting condensate prove to be the lowest - energy excitations from the viewpoint of the excitation energy per particle .",
    "the parameters of the theory may be determined in landau s style by comparison with the experiment . as a matter of fact ,",
    "for the threshold voltage of a normal metal - dielectric - superconductor tunnel transition , corresponding to one - electron processes , we have the following equation : @xmath62 which , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq-10 ] ) , forms a complete system of equations to determine the parameters of the simplest version of the theory .",
    "the remaining bound multielectron states , for which the occupation numbers are not good quantum numbers in the aforementioned sense , may be accounted for by inserting the nondiagonal terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "yet this does not substantially distort the microscopic picture of the phenomenon by virtue of two interrelated causes .",
    "firstly , these terms are small in their absolute values calculated per excitation electron , compared with the bound energy of s - state , which has already been accounted for .",
    "secondly , both the state of the condensate itself and the state of excitations of electron or hole pairs are separated by an energy gap from other states , into which they could have passed under the effect of the nondiagonal terms being considered .",
    "therefore , in considering both the state of condensate and that of excitation of electron ( hole ) couples , the arisen nondiagonal terms may be accounted for in the framework of the perturbation theory without any substantial changes in the wave functions and excitation spectrum .    let consider the aforesaid limit @xmath36 .",
    "the energies of the bound states of the starting hamiltonian  ( [ eq-1 ] ) are of an analytical character in relation to the parameter @xmath63 throughout the whole range of admissible values .",
    "this is why the analyticity of the energy parameters of the fermi - liquid theory of landau relative to the same parameter can not raise doubts .",
    "then the presence of the aforementioned delta - shaped correction to the landau function for all the admissible values of @xmath28 seems to be obvious .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that the contribution from the coulomb eei , though weakened by accounting for the correlation effects in a degenerated electron plasma  @xcite , is able to destroy the distinctly formulated microscopic picture of sc .",
    "however , the question being discussed is beyond the scope of the posed task .",
    "a particular interest is spurred by the divergence of the bonding energy @xmath29 at @xmath64 , following from eq .",
    "( [ eq-4 ] ) . in real systems",
    ", this divergence should not reveal itself in the observed @xmath3 by virtue of symmetry reasons put forward in  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , with varying parameters of specimens , there should be observed a maximum of the transition temperatures if the following condition were fulfilled : @xmath65 this condition can be with a satisfactory accuracy fulfilled in systems with variable physical parameters , in which , provided eq .",
    "( [ eq-12 ] ) is obeyed , htsc should be observed .",
    "let consider a semiconductor with a rather low concentration of electroactive defects , undergoing a phase transition with a change in volume . in both phases ,",
    "the material is stable , and , as a rule , @xmath66 ( here @xmath67 ) . in unstable phases @xmath68 .",
    "it is possible to assume htsc is observed in nonequilibrium systems , where the phase transition is decelerated @xmath69 ( the diamond - graphite transition is not realized exclusively due to kinetic reasons ) .",
    "the basic qualitative differences of the bcs theory from the suggested sc model are listed below .",
    "\\1 . in accordance with the bcs theory ,",
    "the superconducting condensate is formed by the couples of electrons with zero momenta , and is therefore called bose condensate .    in the proposed theory ,",
    "the superconducting condensate is formed by electrons , and , accordingly , transforms into the fermi condensate .",
    "\\2 . in accordance with the bcs theory ,",
    "the most low - energy excitations are essentially the electron couples with zero momenta .    in the proposed theory ,",
    "such excitations at the lowest temperatures are the electron couples with momenta @xmath60 and hole couples with @xmath61 .",
    "\\3 . in the bcs theory ,",
    "the ground state of the system is obtained through the superposition of the states with different charges .",
    "it is this property that underlies one of the formulations of the bcs theory using correlators @xmath70 and @xmath71 that are different from zero .",
    "now , in the proposed theory the corresponding correlators are strictly equal to zero .",
    "it is easy to show each of the states with a fixed charge , forming the superposition of the ground state of the bcs theory , is stationary state , and , hence , also ground one in conformity with the charge - conservation law .",
    "thus , a conclusion may be drawn on the eventual degeneration of the ground state of the system in the bcs theory .",
    "this means its chemical potential @xmath72@xmath73@xmath74@xmath75 at @xmath76 must be strictly equal to zero ; therefore , the work function of electrons in sc also must be equal to zero .",
    "now , in the proposed model such a requirement is irrelevant .",
    "the considered theories give different expressions for such parameters as energy gap and coherence length .",
    "it is curious that the coherence length in the bcs theory decreases as the bonding energy of a couple increases , reaching a value on the order of several @xmath77ngstrms  @xcite .",
    "this appears very strange in view of the coulomb repulsion energy arising at such a spacing .    in the proposed model",
    ", the coherence length can not be shorter than the value of @xmath78 .",
    "although one has achieved in the framework of bcs theory consistency of the experimental data with the microscopic calculation results in ( ht)sc materials , this can hardly be considered a convincing proof in its favor .",
    "a scepsis about this point should be paid heed to , being expressed by some authors with regard to the reliability of the calculation of so subtle values as epi constants to be used in assessing the bcs theory .",
    "we also ca nt help noting here the absence of unitary transformations linking frhlich s hamiltonian , in the framework of which one tries to substantiate the introduction of cooper couples , to any of the hamiltonians used in the bcs theory . in view of studies",
    "@xcite , this fact should cause some sort of uneasiness .",
    "the interpretations of experimental results in both theories are fairly close , differing merely in some details .",
    "in fact , the charges of low - energy excitations of the system of couples of electrons and holes are equal in the theories under examination .",
    "this is why the consequences of ginzburg - landau theory will not differ substantially .",
    "now , if the phenomena were investigated , being associated with the dissipation of energy in an electronic system , their interpretation is connected , as a rule , with the energy densities of excited states . by and large ,",
    "their form in both theories exhibits no qualitative differences either .",
    "therefore , both the fulfilment of relationship  ( [ eq-12 ] ) in observing htsc and the investigation of the work function of electrons in sc materials so far seem to be sole practicable methods for the experimental comparison of the theories .",
    "one may expect the fulfilment of relationship  ( [ eq-12 ] ) with good accuracy in the vicinity of the boundaries of stability of hp phases . from this standpoint",
    ", it seems to be very promising to investigate the kinetics of the phase transitions at hp with a view to searching for new htsc materials .",
