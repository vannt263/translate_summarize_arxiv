    "di - higgs production in the standard model ( sm ) has a very small rate at the lhc @xcite . for @xmath10  gev ,",
    "the leading order cross section is @xmath11  fb at @xmath12  tev .",
    "this is much smaller than the single higgs production cross section due to the larger partonic energy needed to produce two higgs bosons , as well as an accidental cancellation between the @xmath13-channel and box diagram contributions to the amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "hence , like other accidentally suppressed processes in the standard model , di - higgs production provides a great opportunity for new physics to be observed . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that in the presence of a a general set of light colored scalars , the di - higgs production cross section can be enhanced by orders of magnitude above the standard model rate .",
    "light colored scalars that couple to the higgs boson are well known to have a profound effect on _ single _ higgs production  @xcite .",
    "di - higgs production has been considered previously in several different contexts @xcite .    since direct searches at the lhc for light colored scalars that couple to the higgs",
    "have many constraints , depending on the model and the decay modes , the burden is on us to provide a `` benchmark model '' that evades these constraints while providing the enhancements in di - higgs production that we find .",
    "several possible representations could be considered , including the superpartners to the top , vector - like sets of particles ( that may or may not carry electroweak quantum numbers ) , or real representations such as an electroweak neutral color octet .    a real scalar octet is an interesting example of a colored scalar that can be effectively hidden in the lhc data . in the model that we consider ,",
    "these scalars are pair - produced ( up to small corrections coming from loop processes ) , and decay through loop - level processes to a pair of gluons .",
    "thus , the signature is two pairs of jets with equal invariant mass , making four total jets .",
    "atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite have multi - jet searches that are potentially sensitive to this scalar ; the atlas study restricts @xmath15  gev , while the cms study @xcite is sensitive only for scalars exceeding @xmath16  gev .",

    "a real scalar color octet @xmath17 can couple to the higgs boson through the renormalizable higgs - portal interaction of the form @xmath18 .",
    "vital to our study is the possibility that @xmath19 can be negative , as we will see .",
    "the correlation between effects in single - higgs and di - higgs production has been studied previously in terms of contact interactions  @xcite . for very heavy colored scalars  meaning scalars",
    "whose mass is large compared to the electroweak scale , @xmath20 , as well as to the characteristic energy of di - higgs production ( roughly @xmath21  the effective operators provide a reasonable description .",

    "low energy theorems for higgs physics provide powerful methods to determine the effective higgs couplings to both standard model particles as well as new physics @xcite .",

    "sec : dihiggs125 ] , given a range in the single higgs production rate , there is a corresponding range of @xmath138 parameter space .",
    "the wider the range , the larger the variation in the di - higgs production rate .",
    "here we are interested in the absolute rate of di - higgs production . while we have not calculated beyond one - loop , ref .",
    "@xcite found the @xmath139 factor for di - higgs production in the standard model to be @xmath140 .",
    "this means @xmath141 at @xmath97  tev . because there are two higgs bosons in the final state , the rate for di - higgs to feed into any characteristic single - higgs final state ( @xmath142 , etc . )",
    "is obviously doubled .",
    "we expect that these di - higgs events would be captured by the inclusive single higgs searches at the lhc . in the absence of an observation",
    ", this should allow atlas and cms to obtain an estimate of the upper bound on the di - higgs enhancement .",
    "dedicated analyses of existing @xmath143 and @xmath144  tev data that focus on the exact di - higgs final state and kinematics , such as @xmath145 , would undoubtedly increase the sensitivity to the signal .",
    "the discovery prospects for some di - higgs final states , including with enhanced production rate , have been outlined in ref .",
    ". however , in the time since those studies there have been significant advances in the usage of jet substructure as a discovery tool , for both hadronic ( @xmath146 )  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite resonances . given the relatively high @xmath51 that the higgs bosons can carry , i.e. , fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics1 ] , we expect di - higgs events to be well suited to substructure techniques .    the rates , in @xmath147 , for several potential di - higgs final states are shown in table  [ table : rates ] .",
    "all rates are functions of the enhancement @xmath148 and we have taken the @xmath139-factor to be @xmath149 throughout .",
    "we find that varying the parton distribution set changes the cross - section by @xmath150 .",
    ".the di - higgs signal production rates into the different modes when @xmath10  gev and @xmath136  gev .",
    "all rates , which include a k factor of 2.0 , must be multiplied by the enhancement factor @xmath148 which can be read off from the di - higgs contours in fig .",
    "[ fig:125 ] ( @xmath10  gev ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : othermh ] ( @xmath136  gev ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , < , < \" , ]     now , in the alternative case @xmath136  gev , the single higgs production cross section is constrained to be less than the present lhc bounds .",
    "this basically requires us to choose @xmath94 within the red or blue region of fig .",
    "[ fig : othermh ] . by taking @xmath136  gev ,",
    "both diboson decay modes are open , i.e. , @xmath151 , and the di - higgs production phenomenology becomes fairly insensitive to the exact value of the higgs mass . in table",
    "[ table : rates ] we show the rates for the various combinations of dibosons .",
    "the @xmath152 is the largest , and provides several opportunities involving same - sign dileptons or trileptons plus missing energy . here",
    "again , jet substructure techniques could provide valuable additional sensitivity given the large @xmath51 of the higgs bosons in di - higgs production .",
    "we have demonstrated that di - higgs production at the lhc could be many orders of magnitude larger than the standard model in a the presence of light colored scalars .",
    "the large enhancements are possible if @xmath10  gev , consistent with the recent data from lhc , as well as if @xmath23  gev , should the @xmath2  gev particle turn out to be a higgs imposter .",
    "the latter region is natural in a model with light colored scalars , since this model was already demonstrated to effectively hide the higgs below the lhc limits @xcite .",
    "the largest effects occur when the higgs - portal coupling @xmath19 is negative and colored scalars that are lighter than the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "our detailed numerical results were performed in a model with a single , real , color octet scalar .",
    "direct production of the colored scalar and decay to pairs of gluons is presently constrained by lhc data only for @xmath153  gev .",
    "hence , a wide range of @xmath94 space remains viable that can lead to the huge di - higgs enhancement rates that we find .",
    "our calculation of the production rates were performed for a general set of colored scalars at leading order , and thus up to the overall multiplicity , are independent of the electroweak quantum numbers .",
    "the detailed branching fractions of the higgs will , of course , depend on the electroweak quantum numbers .",
    "generally this leads to @xmath84 effects on the branching fractions , whereas the di - higgs production rate enhancements we found can be orders of magnitude larger .",
    "it would be interesting to perform a more detailed investigation of the correlation between single higgs production and decay , with other representations of colored scalars , versus the di - higgs production cross section  @xcite .",
    "in addition , electroweak charged scalars will alter a wider set of processes than electroweak singlets : @xmath154 , where @xmath155 will all change due to loops of electroweak charged scalars , in addition to @xmath156 . restricting to electroweak neutral colored scalars , we were somewhat forced to use octets .",
    "this is because smaller representations , for instance the color triplet or sextet , are _ stable _ when the scalars are electroweak singlets .",
    "the signals of di - higgs production provide several exciting opportunities for the lhc .",
    "we have already seen that di - higgs production could have _ already _ contributed a fraction of the single higgs production rate , with the second higgs missed ( or unidentified ) in the events .",
    "if @xmath10  gev , among the more interesting di - higgs signals includes @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "each of these signals has two pairs of particles that reconstruct to two higgs bosons .",
    "if @xmath23  gev , there are several channels resulting from @xmath160 , including same - sign leptons plus missing energy as well as trileptons plus missing energy that could be seen at lhc .",
    "the latter two searches might first obtain evidence from recasted supersymmetric searches , while a more dedicated search strategy would undoubtedly improve the sensitivity .",
    "jet substructure may also provide a valuable additional strategy for both low and high higgs masses .",
    "the passarino - veltman functions are defined by :    @xmath161",
    "comparison of exact one - loop result against that obtained from using the effective couplings in fig .",
    "[ fig : operatorcompare ] .",
    "here we only show a `` zoomed in '' region for small @xmath85 and negative @xmath19 , where the differences between the calculations are largest .",
    "nevertheless , we have verified that for @xmath162 , the contours asymptotically agree .",
    "the renormalization group equations for @xmath19 , @xmath76 , and @xmath93 ( taking @xmath77 to be small and negligible ) are : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the @xmath165 coupling and @xmath93 is the standard model higgs quartic coupling .",
    "all terms in the @xmath19 renormalization group equation are proportional to @xmath19 , since @xmath166 is technically natural .",
    "the running of @xmath93 is also changed by the higgs portal interaction : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the @xmath169-function for the higgs quartic coupling coming from sm interactions .    for large positive @xmath19 ,",
    "( [ eq : kapparge ] ) shows that @xmath19 will grow and ultimately hit a landau pole , similar to what happens with the higgs quartic coupling . for large negative @xmath19",
    ", however , eq .  ( [ eq : kapparge ] ) shows that the higgs - portal interaction rapidly _ decreases _ until the other terms in the renormalization group equation become important .",
    "hence , a one - loop renormalization group improved potential is necessary to analyze the stability of the effective potential in the presence of a large negative @xmath19 coupling .",
    "our estimates suggest @xmath170 is perfectly acceptable , however a detailed analysis of the scalar potential is beyond the scope of this paper .",
