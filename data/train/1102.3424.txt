    "despite the conclusion of data - taking in  2008 , the cleo - c experiment  which utilizes symmetric @xmath2 collisions in the charmonium region provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr )  continues to have an active program in the analysis of charmonium data .",
    "recent cleo - c studies include : ( 1 )  measurements of the branching fractions of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  @xcite ; ( 2 )  studies of @xmath6 decays to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 and a confirmation of the besii observation of the @xmath9 , a @xmath10 threshold enhancement in @xmath11  @xcite ; ( 3 )  a search for the radiative transition @xmath12  @xcite ; ( 4 )  measurements of the higher order multipoles in the radiative transitions @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite ; and ( 5 )  the discovery of the process @xmath0 at a center of mass energy of @xmath1 ( preliminary ) . in the following , each study is briefly reviewed .",
    "starting with the full sample of 25.9  million @xmath6 decays , cleo - c measured the branching fractions for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "these results are important inputs to predictions of the related charmonium production rates ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a hadron ) that will be studied by the panda experiment at gsi .",
    "in addition , the dalitz plots of @xmath17 have been studied ( figure  [ fig : pppi ] ) .",
    "an enhancement in @xmath10 mass appears , which is inconsistent with both predictions from the meson emission model  @xcite and the @xmath9 threshold enhancement  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath18 decays discussed above , cleo - c has also measured the branching fractions of @xmath6 decays to final states involving a @xmath10 pair  @xcite .",
    "the dalitz plots of @xmath8 and @xmath4 show evidence for the production of a number of @xmath19 resonances in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but do not show evidence for a @xmath10 threshold enhancement consistent with the @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath9 is also not seen in the @xmath6 radiative decay to @xmath10 .",
    "however , evidence is found for the @xmath9 through the process @xmath22 , which provides confirmation of the original besii discovery  @xcite .",
    "in the spectroscopy of charmonium below @xmath24 threshold , the @xmath23 remains one of the least measured states .",
    "cleo - c performed a search for the @xmath23 in the allowed @xmath25 transition , @xmath12 , where the potential @xmath23 was fully reconstructed in sixteen of its possible decay modes to light quark systems  @xcite .",
    "upper limits on the product branching fractions , @xmath26 , were separately set for each possible decay mode of the @xmath23 , @xmath16 .",
    "the upper limits ranged from approximately @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig : multipoles ]    the radiative decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 are dominated by electric dipole  ( e1 ) amplitudes , but are expected to have small additional contributions from the higher - order magnetic quadrupole  ( m2 ) amplitudes .",
    "the relative contributions of the m2 amplitudes are , at least in principle , sensitive to the anomalous magnetic moment of the charm quark .",
    "cleo performed a high - statistics analysis of this process using the decay chains @xmath29 for @xmath30 , using clean samples of approximately @xmath31 events for @xmath32 and approximately @xmath33 events for @xmath34  @xcite , significantly larger event samples than previous measurements . using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to angular distributions , cleo found the following normalized m2 admixtures : for @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; for @xmath38 @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; for @xmath41 @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; and for @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 . for the quoted @xmath34 measurements ,",
    "the electric octupole  ( e3 ) moments were fixed to zero .",
    "there is clear evidence for non - zero m2 amplitudes ( left plot of figure  [ fig : multipoles ] ) .",
    "these new measurements agree well with theoretical expectations when the anomalous magnetic moment of the charm quark is assumed to be zero and the mass of the charm quark is assumed to be @xmath47 , as shown in the right plot of figure  [ fig : multipoles ] .",
    "finally , cleo - c has presented preliminary results on the observation of @xmath0 at a center of mass energy of @xmath1 .",
    "this builds upon a previous analysis of cleo - c to study the @xmath49 @xmath50 cross sections as a function of center of mass energy  @xcite . in that analysis a rise in the cross section at @xmath51 for both the @xmath52 and @xmath53 reactions was attributed to the @xmath54 , a charmonium hybrid meson candidate first discovered by babar  @xcite . since that analysis , cleo - c has collected a total of @xmath55 of data at @xmath1 , about twenty times larger than the data sets used to search for @xmath56 between 4120 and 4200  @xmath57 . using this larger data set ,",
    "cleo - c has made the first observation of @xmath0 at @xmath1 and has searched for @xmath0 in the original scan data , which spans energies from @xmath58 to @xmath51 .",
    "the reaction @xmath0 was exclusively reconstructed using @xmath59 and twelve decay modes of the @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "all final state particles were detected and the sum of their four - momenta was constrained to the four - momentum of the initial @xmath2 system .",
    "the quality ( @xmath73 ) of this kinematic fit was used to select events .",
    "the @xmath60 was selected by requiring the recoil mass of the @xmath74 system be within @xmath75 of the @xmath60 mass .",
    "then the @xmath76 recoil mass was used to isolate the @xmath77 signal .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ fig : hcsignal ] shows the @xmath76 recoil mass when all twelve decay modes of the @xmath60 are summed together .",
    "there is a peak at the @xmath48 mass , which contains @xmath78 events and has a @xmath79 significance . to convert this to a cross section , however , one must know the @xmath60 branching fractions .",
    "the right plot of figure  [ fig : hcsignal ] shows the same figure except now restricted to those decay modes of the @xmath60 that have measured branching fractions .",
    "here there are @xmath80 events with a @xmath81 significance .",
    "this corresponds to a cross section of @xmath0 of @xmath82 , where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic , and the third is due to the errors on the external measurements of the @xmath60 branching fractions and the branching fraction of @xmath59 . for reference ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath83 at @xmath1 is @xmath84 .    to obtain a scan of the @xmath77",
    "cross section as a function of center of mass energy , the same procedure was followed using the smaller samples of scan data . following the @xmath56 scan  @xcite ,",
    "the data is divided into three bins : @xmath85 ; @xmath86 ; and @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig : scan ] shows the resulting @xmath77 cross section as a function of center of mass energy .",
    "the @xmath52 results are included for reference .",
    "there is perhaps a suggestive rise at @xmath51 , but more data is clearly needed ."
