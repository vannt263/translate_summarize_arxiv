    "the @xmath0 is a new hadronic resonance discovered in 2003 by the belle collaboration @xcite and subsequently confirmed by the cdf , babar , and d0 collaborations @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath0 has many features in common with the deuteron , which is a weakly - bound baryonic molecule consisting of a proton and a neutron .",
    "their binding energies are both small compared to the natural energy scale associated with pion exchange : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the reduced mass of the two constituents .",
    "the binding energy 2.2  mev of the deuteron is small compared to the natural scale of about 20  mev . after taking into account a recent precision measurement of the @xmath5 mass by the cleo collaboration @xcite , the difference between the measured mass of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 threshold is @xmath6 this is small compared to the natural energy scale of about 10  mev .",
    "the belle collaboration has set an upper bound on the width of the @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8 this is also small compared to the natural energy scale .",
    "the small width is most easily understood if the @xmath7 is below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "because the binding energies of the deuteron and the @xmath0 are small compared to the natural energy scales , they have universal properties that are determined by the large scattering length @xmath9 of the constituents @xcite .",
    "the universality of few - body systems with a large scattering length has many applications in atomic , nuclear , and particle physics @xcite .",
    "the universal features of the @xmath0 were first exploited by voloshin to describe its decays into @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which can proceed through decay of the constituent @xmath12 or @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "universality has also been applied to the production process @xmath14 @xcite , to the line shape of the @xmath7 @xcite , and to decays of @xmath7 into @xmath15 and pions @xcite .",
    "these applications rely on factorization formulas that separate the length scale @xmath9 from all the shorter distance scales of qcd @xcite .",
    "the factorization formulas can be derived using the operator product expansion for a low - energy effective field theory @xcite .",
    "there is one feature of the @xmath0 that is very different from the deuteron .",
    "the mass difference between the constituents @xmath12 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 mev , is very close to the @xmath18 mass : @xmath19 mev .",
    "thus the @xmath12 mass is very close to the @xmath20 threshold : @xmath21 mev .",
    "this is important because the pion is the lightest meson that can be exchanged between the @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "the small energy gap between the @xmath12 mass and the @xmath20 threshold makes it easy for the @xmath12 to make a transition to @xmath20 .",
    "an important consequence is that the @xmath7 could have a substantial 3-body component @xmath10 .",
    "suzuki has argued that the near equality of @xmath22 and @xmath23 implies that the pion - exchange interaction is too weak to bind the @xmath7 @xcite , but this conclusion has been criticized @xcite .",

    "the charge conjugation @xmath32 requires the molecule to be a superposition of charm mesons : @xmath33 .",
    "the interaction of the charm mesons with pions depends on the pion momentum .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the effects of pions on the @xmath7 might require all these effects to be taken into account .    since the new feature of the @xmath0 is the near equality between the mass difference @xmath22 of the constituents and the mass @xmath23 of a meson that can be exchanged between them , it is worthwhile to analyze this feature in a simple model that avoids all the other complications of the @xmath7 .",
    "the simplest such model is one in which the primary constituents @xmath34 and @xmath35 are spin-0 mesons with a large positive scattering length and a momentum - independent coupling to a lighter spin-0 meson @xmath36 .",
