    "the concordance cosmological model  based on a family of non - relativistic massive particles possibly weakly interacting with the standard sector of particle physics ( cold dark matter particles , cdm hereafter ) and on a cosmological constant @xmath3  very successfully accounts for a large wealth of observational data , but poses significant theoretical puzzles and requires an extreme fine - tuning of its basic parameters . in this context ,",
    "alternative scenarios have been explored , as i.e. the possibility that the cosmological constant @xmath3 be replaced by a dark energy ( de ) component represented by a classical dynamical scalar field @xmath4 evolving in a self interaction potential @xcite .",
    "a further step in the exploration of alternative cosmological models has been recently proposed , speculating about a possible direct interaction between the de and the cdm sectors of the universe @xcite .",
    "such coupled dark energy models ( cde ) have been widely investigated in recent years concerning their background evolution and their effects on structure formation ( e.g. by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by means of specifically designed n - body algorithms aimed at exploring the nonlinear evolution of cosmic structures within these alternative scenarios @xcite .",
    "these studies have led to the highlight of some distinctive features in the evolved matter density fields of cde models and have shown how the properties of nonlinear collapsed objects can be significantly affected by the dark interactions in a potentially observable way @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the most important tasks in the present investigation of these alternative models consists in linking the predictions obtained for the cdm density distribution to directly observable quantities .",
    "@xcite very recently brought up a speculative idea , namely that the dark sector interaction might be probed by measuring the alignment between galaxy and matter distributions in triaxial clusters .",
    "in @xmath0cdm cosmology , the spatial correlations of the large - scale tidal fields yield the strong alignments of the satellite galaxies in the clusters with the cluster dark matter distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite claimed that the alignment of the cluster galaxies with the underlying cdm distribution would be weaker in the cde models than in @xmath0cdm since the spatial correlations of the tidal fields inside the clusters would be less strong due to the existence of a fifth force .",
    "if this is really the case , the alignment between galaxy and matter distributions in triaxial clusters would provide a unique probe of the cde scenarios , especially because the alignment angle is insensitive to the other cosmological parameters .",
    "to back up the speculative idea of @xcite , it is essential to examine numerically whether or not the cde scalar field truly makes a detectable difference on the cluster galaxy - matter alignment .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use high - resolution n - body simulations to study how the alignment between satellites and the underlying dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters changes in cde models as compared to @xmath0cdm @xcite .",
    "the dark interaction between the de scalar field @xmath4 and cdm which characterizes cde models affects the growth of cosmic structures in a manifold way .",
    "first of all , the background expansion history of the universe is changed with respect to the standard @xmath3cdm evolution by the dynamical nature of the de scalar field @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the mass of cdm particles changes in time due to the exchange of energy with the de sector , and the coupling between the two fields determines a new long - range fifth force between cdm particles and an effective  modified inertia \" in the form of a velocity - dependent acceleration .",
    "these features can be expressed by a modified acceleration equation for cdm particles in the newtonian limit : @xmath5 m_{j}(\\phi ) \\vec{r}_{ij}}{|\\vec{r}_{ij}|^{3 } } \\,,\\ ] ] where the reduced planck mass is defined as @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the coupling strength , @xmath8 is the velocity of the @xmath9-th particle , @xmath10 is the vector distance between the @xmath9-th and the @xmath11-th particles , and the sum extends to all the cdm particles in the universe .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of equation  [ acceleration_equation ] represents the  modified inertia \" , while the @xmath12 $ ] factor that multiplies the gravitational constant is the  fifth - force \" .",
    "all these effects have been studied in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  to which we refer the interested reader for a more detailed explanation of the cde effects  and need to be properly included in n - body algorithms in order to consistently evolve the growth of density perturbations in these scenarios .    in the present work ,",
    "we rely on the numerical implementation of cde models in the treepm cosmological n - body code gadget-2 @xcite presented in @xcite , with which we run a series of cosmological simulations for a fiducial @xmath3cdm cosmology with wmap7 parameters and two cde scenarios with the same background parameters and with linear density perturbations normalized at the present time @xmath13 .",
    "our cde models consist of one constant coupling scenario with @xmath14 ( the exp005 model of @xcite ) and one variable coupling model with @xmath15 ( the exp010e2 model of @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the coupling definition assumed in this work is different from some of the literature and our values of the coupling are @xmath16 smaller than the ones quoted in e.g. @xcite .",
    "for these three different cosmologies we run a cdm simulation on a cosmological box of @xmath17 comoving @xmath18mpc aside , with @xmath19 particles .",
    "this corresponds to a space resolution of @xmath20 kpc and to a mass resolution at @xmath13 of @xmath21 .",
    "we then link cdm particles into groups with a friends - of - friends procedure and for each main halo we identify all the bound substructures by means of the subfind algorithm @xcite .",
    "let us remind that we use the same initial random field in all our simulations .",
    "this allows us the possibility of a one - to - one comparison between different models .    in order to compare the results of our numerical simulations with observations we need to assign to each (",
    "sub)halo a stellar mass .",
    "for this purpose we use the recently derived stellar - to - halo mass relationship presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors give a series of simple fitting formulae to derive the stellar mass of the galaxy hosted by a given dark matter halo as a function of the virial mass ( for central galaxies ) or as a function of the maximum mass over the halo s history ( for satellite galaxies ) .",
    "for all our substructures we therefore build a full merger tree and we assign to each subhalo a stellar mass based on the latter criterion by using the formulae of @xcite .",
    "however , these formulae have been derived by comparing the observed galaxy luminosity function with the halo mass function in a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "this implies that we can not directly apply them in the case of cde models . in order to overcome this issue",
    ", we first find a function @xmath22 able to map the cde mass function onto the @xmath0cdm one and then we apply the @xcite fitting equations .",
    "the cdm density and the location of the 30 most luminous substructures inside two virial radii for the same massive cluster within the three different cosmologies under investigation are plotted in the three panels of figure  [ fig : halos ] , where a stronger tendency of alignment between the cdm distribution and the selected substructures in the @xmath3cdm model as compared to cde scenarios is already visible .",
    "from each cluster catalog obtained from the simulations for the @xmath0cdm and cde cosmologies , we select those cluster halos which have five or more galaxies within some cut - off radius @xmath23 from the halo center",
    ". then , we measure the alignment angles between the galaxy and dark matter distributions of each selected cluster halo through the following procedure .",
    "first , the inertia tensor of the galaxy distribution of each selected cluster halo , @xmath24 , is evaluated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the stellar mass of the @xmath27-th galaxy and @xmath28 is the position vector of the @xmath27-th satellite galaxy relative to the center of the stellar mass of the galaxy distribution . weighting the satellites by stellar mass is important for a comparison with observations since in practice the shapes of galaxy distributions are often obtained from the luminosity - weighted satellites . finding the unit eigenvector of @xmath24 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue , we determine the major axis , @xmath29 , of the galaxy distribution of each selected cluster halo .    similarly , we evaluate the inertia tensor , @xmath30 , of the cdm distribution of each selected cluster halo as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the position vector of the @xmath33-th dark matter particle relative to the halo center .",
    "the summation in equation ( [ eqn : inertia_dm ] ) goes over all dark matter particles located within the halo virial radius @xmath34 .",
    "finding the unit eigenvector of @xmath30 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue , we determine the major axis , @xmath35 , of the cdm distribution of each selected cluster halo .",
    "the alignment angle , @xmath36 , between dark matter and galaxy distributions of each selected halo is now calculated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is in the range of @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "binning the values of @xmath38 and counting the number of the halos belonging to each @xmath38-bin , we derive the probability density distribution , @xmath40 , for the @xmath0cdm and cde cosmologies , separately .",
    "when the cut - off radius @xmath41 for the satellite galaxies is set at @xmath42 ( see figure [ fig : ar_align ] ) , the total number of the selected cluster halos which have five or more galaxies within @xmath41 is found to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the @xmath0cdm and cde cosmologies , respectively .    before making a comparison between the probability distributions of @xmath38 from the two cosmologies ,",
    "it is worth examining how robust our measurement of @xmath38 is .",
    "if the dark matter distribution of a given halo is spherically symmetric , then the determination of the major principal axis of its inertia tensor would be quite ambiguous .",
    "therefore , the robustness of the measurement of @xmath38 of a given halo critically depends on how spherical its dark matter distribution is .",
    "the sphericity of a given halo is conventionally defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the inertia tensor of the dark matter distribution , respectively . using this definition",
    ", we measure the sphericity of each selected halo for both cosmologies .",
    "figure [ fig : shape ] plots the number distribution of the selected halos versus their sphericity for cde and @xmath0cdm cosmologies as solid and dashed histogram , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , for the case of cde there is no halo whose sphericity is larger than @xmath48 , while for @xmath0cdm there is only one halo whose sphericity exceeds @xmath48 .",
    "thus , our measurement of @xmath38 is robust , free from the ambiguity caused by the spherically symmetric dark matter distribution .    given that our samples of the halos for both cosmologies are not large enough to be fully representative of the true parent populations , we perform the bootstrap error analysis to estimate the uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we first construct @xmath49 bootstrap resamples and measure @xmath40 from each resample . the bootstrap error , @xmath50 , at each bin",
    "is then calculated as one standard deviation among the @xmath49 remeasurements , @xmath51^{2}\\rangle^{1/2}$ ] , where the ensemble average is taken over the @xmath49 resamples and @xmath52 represents the bootstrap mean value at the @xmath9-th bin .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:3dalign ] plots the resulting @xmath40 with the bootstrap errors for cde and @xmath0cdm cosmologies as square and triangle dots , respectively . for this plot ,",
    "the cut - off radius @xmath41 for the satellite galaxies is set at @xmath42 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:3dalign ] , the probability density distribution increases with @xmath38 in both cosmologies , which indicates that the major axes of the galaxy and dark matter distributions in clusters tend to be strongly aligned .",
    "however , we note a difference between the two cosmologies : @xmath40 increases less rapidly in the cde model . at the fourth @xmath38-bin ( corresponding to @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the difference between the two models exceeds @xmath54 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig:3dalign ] plots the ratio between the two probability density distributions : @xmath55 , which demonstrates clearly that the ratio deviates from unity and the degree of the deviation reaches the maximum at the fourth bin .    now that we find a difference between the two cosmologies in the tendency of the cluster galaxy - matter alignment , we would like to investigate how the result depends on the cut - off radius @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , it is naturally expected that as @xmath41 decreases the alignment tendency would decrease .",
    "the major axes of the dark matter distribution are determined at @xmath34 while the major axes of the galaxy distribution are measured at @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath56 represents the distance by which the inner and outer tidal fields are separated .",
    "as @xmath41 decreases , the spatial correlations between the two tidal fields would decrease , which would be manifested by the decrease of the strength of the alignment between the major axes of the galaxy and matter distributions in clusters .    repeating the whole process described above",
    ", we calculate the probability density at the fourth bin , @xmath57 , for five different choices for @xmath41 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : ar_align ] plots the result for cde and @xmath0cdm cosmologies as square and triangle dots , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : ar_align ] plots the ratio of the square points ( cde ) to the triangle points ( @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ar_align ] reveals that in the cde scenario the probability density , @xmath58 , decreases more rapidly as @xmath41 decreases .",
    "this result may be interpreted as the effect of coupled dark energy on the spatial correlations of the tidal fields inside the cluster halos . due to the coupling between dark matter and dark energy",
    ", there is an additional tidal force exerted on the galaxies inside the clusters , which plays a role of reducing further the correlations of galaxy distributions with matter distributions .",
    "furthermore , the velocity - dependent acceleration arising as a consequence of the  modified inertia \" described by the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ acceleration_equation ] ) also contributes to an effective modification of the internal tidal field of the cluster experienced by the substructures since it determines an effective extra force along the direction of motion of the satellite halos .    to make a direct comparison with observations",
    ", it may be more useful to find the probability density distribution of the two dimensional projected alignment angles , @xmath59 . for each cosmological model , we project @xmath29 and @xmath35 of each selected halo cluster onto the xy , yz and zx planes and calculate the two dimensional alignment angle @xmath59 between the projected major axes of dark matter and galaxy distributions for all three projection cases and determine the probability density distribution , @xmath60 , by taking the average over the three cases . to estimate the uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath60",
    ", we also perform the boostrap error analysis .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:2dalign ] plots the @xmath60 with the bootstrap errors for cde and @xmath0cdm cosmologies as square and triangle dots , respectively .",
    "as one can see , the two dimensional projection does not dilute the difference in the alignment tendency between the two models .",
    "the probability density distribution , @xmath61 , decreases less rapidly as @xmath59 increases in the cde model than in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "note that for a three dimensional distribution , it is @xmath40 that is expected to be uniformly distributed in case of no alignment while for the two dimensional case , it is @xmath61 .    to quantify the statistical significance of the difference in the galaxy - matter alignments between @xmath0cdm and cde cosmologies",
    ", we perform a wald test for the ratio , @xmath62 . in the null hypothesis @xmath63",
    "that the two probability density distributions shown in figures [ fig:3dalign ] and [ fig:2dalign ] are in fact from the same parent population , the expectation value of @xmath64 is unity at all bins . taking into account the possible cross - correlations of @xmath40 between the different bins ,",
    "we calculate the generalized @xmath1 defined in terms of the full covariance matrix as @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the inverse of the covariance matrix , @xmath67 , where the ensemble average is taken over the @xmath49 bootstrap resamples and @xmath68 denotes the mean value of @xmath64 averaged over the bootstrap resamples at the @xmath9-th bin . in equation ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) , @xmath69 expresses how much the numerical result of @xmath64 at the @xmath9-th bin deviates from the expectation value of unity .",
    "we find @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the three and two dimensional case , respectively .",
    "since the number of degrees of freedom for @xmath1 is @xmath72 , its value corresponds to the null hypothesis being rejected at the @xmath73 confidence level for both cases .",
    "using data from high - resolution n - body simulations , we have shown that the @xmath0cdm and cde cosmologies yield different strengths of the alignment between satellite galaxy and matter distributions in triaxial clusters .",
    "as speculated by @xcite , it is found that the alignment is less strong in cde cosmologies than in the standard @xmath0cdm scenario . the null hypothesis that the two cosmologies give the same alignment tendency",
    "is rejected at the @xmath73 confidence level through a wald test based on the generalized @xmath1 statistics .",
    "the differences in the satellite distributions between @xmath0cdm and cde models may be understood as follows .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms for explaining the alignments between the dark matter and galaxy distributions @xcite .",
    "the first one is the spatial correlations between the large scale external tidal fields and the internal tidal fields due to the cluster potentials which affect he non - spherical shapes of dark matter components of galaxy clusters and the anisotropic distributions of their satellite galaxies , respectively .",
    "the second one is the filamentary merging / accretion of matter and galaxies along the large - scale filaments , which also induce the alignments between the dark matter and galaxy distributions in clusters .    in the @xmath0cdm cosmology ,",
    "the tidal fields evolve nonlinearly only via gravity . whereas in the cde cosmology the coupling between dark energy and dark matter generate additional ( more isotropic ) tidal effects in the clusters , which weaken the spatial correlations between the external and internal tidal fields and",
    "also redistribute previously accreted satellites that were initially in a flattened distribution .",
    "furthermore , the  modified inertia \" characterizing cde models would contribute to an effective enhancement of the internal cluster tidal field .",
    "recently @xcite compared the observed distribution of satellite galaxies in clusters with the shape of the cluster dark matter distribution determined from weak lensing , finding a very weak alignment @xcite . due to the small sample ( composed of only @xmath74 clusters ) , it is difficult to say at the moment whether or not this observational signal supports the cde scenario . in any case ,",
    "a crucial implication of our results is that the alignment between galaxy and matter distributions in clusters is in principle a unique probe of dark sector interactions .",
