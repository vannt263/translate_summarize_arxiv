    "wall - crossing phenomena and , more generally , the counting of degeneracy of bps states have played a central role during last twenty years of development in superstring theory and supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "bps states , which preserves part of supersymmetry of the underlying field theory or gravity , are supposed to be robust due to the short supermultiplet structure they come with .",
    "this often allows us to probe otherwise inaccessible non - perturbative aspects , such as u - dualty between different string theories or even the grand idea of m - theory . with smaller",
    "supersymmetry preserved , however , this is not always reliable , and a theory sometimes loses or gains bps states suddenly under continuous deformation of parameters , hence the wall - crossing phenomena .",
    "@xcite    arguably , the most versatile framework where the intrinsic degeneracy of bps states can be counted is the quiver quantum mechanics .",
    "this can be motivated rather simply by considering collections of d - branes that are completely wrapped on supersymmetric cycles in calabi - yau 3-fold . for compact calabi - yau s ,",
    "such a collection corresponds to bps black holes while for noncompact ones , to bps states .",
    "this line of approach was initiated by douglas et al . , @xcite and extensively developed by denef s pioneering work @xcite which inspired a lot of physics and mathematics study of the wall - crossing .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , direct and systematic counting of bps states starting with quiver quantum mechanics became available only very recently .",
    "problem of counting wall - crossing discontinuity is often simpler than counting degeneracies themselves .",
    "the so - called coulomb approximation , which is inspired by the multi - center picture of wall - crossing came to fruition in refs.@xcite , which is however later seen to miss a lot of physical states , when the quiver in question involves oriented loops of bifundamental chiral multiplets .",
    "honest and comprehensive counting of witten index was finally formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite not only for quiver theories but also for general gauged linear sigma models ( glsm ) , whose main result is phrased in terms of residue formulae in the space of gauge field expectation values .",
    "section 3 below will summarize the result .    despite such developments , one aspects of the bps",
    "state counting remains much obscure .",
    "namely , how the degeneracy scales as a function of the increasing charge .",
    "this question itself is of course very familiar in the context of bps black holes , with the obvious answer being `` exponentially large , '' yet most of definite answers on such a question are found in systems where wall - crossing is either absent or rather simple .",
    "black holes that preserve four supercharges only and are bps states in the supergravity theory that preserves eight supercharges , microstate counting in general is still unavailable . isolating the correct exponential behaviour from microstate counting based on wrapped d - branes would be most useful , but this looks rather difficult technically despite the above residue formula as the number of residue integral to do grows linearly with charge , and the number of poles to consider itself grows exponentially fast .    on the other hand",
    ", the exponential behaviour of the degeneracy turns out to be present also in certain field theory bps states , albeit to a lesser degree .",
    "this was initially anticipated by kol @xcite on the basis of string - web picture of 1/4 bps dyons in @xmath4 field theory in four dimensions . while the former s argument is somewhat anecdotal , a more definite counting using low energy dynamics of solitons has shown how a highly charges states in field theory can be equipped with an exponentially large degeneracy .",
    "this exponential behaviour is different from that was anticipated with black holes in the following sense . for bps black holes in four dimensional @xmath5 supergravity ,",
    "the scaling is such that @xmath6 for a large charge @xmath7 , while for field theory bps states the anticipated scaling goes like @xmath8 for either , one must deal with quiver quantum mechanics of large rank @xmath9 , and the direct computation become exponentially difficult even with the general formulation of witten index computation , unless one finds a mitigating circumstance .",
    "this note is an attempt to reproduce such an exponential behaviour in the simplest possible nontrivial quiver , namely the kronecker quiver , in the hope of finding more general systematics of large rank quiver dynamics . after a cursory introduction to quiver quantum mechanics",
    ", we go on in section 3 to describe how the witten index of the kronecker quiver of rank @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be computed via diagrammatical representation of the residue formula , following the method in ref .",
    "a useful middle step in this computation is a mutation which take @xmath12 kronecker quiver to @xmath13 kronecker quiver where @xmath1 is the common intersection number .",
    "we briefly discuss how this duality for these quivers could be realized in this context .",
    "especially we obtained @xmath14g_k(x ) = \\frac{k}{d((k-1)d+1 ) } { ( k-1)^2d + ( k-1)\\choose d-1}\\ , \\ ] ] which implies the scaling bahaviour @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the result is consistent with the euler number of quiver moduli spaces which has been widely discussed in the mathematical literature @xcite and in the context of spectral network @xcite .",
    "we close with some further speculations in section 5 .    as this work was completed , a paper @xcite with some overlap has appeared in the arxiv .",
    "the simplest setting where quiver quantum mechanics emerges is type iib theory compactified on calabi - yau 3-fold . the effective theory in the remaining four dimensions carries @xmath5 supersymmetry , and the bps state thereof are realized as d3-branes wrapped on special lagrange subcycles of the calabi - yau .",
    "when the cycle is rigid , as with @xmath17 , the vector multiplet on the d3-brane reduces to quantum mechanical vector multiplet whose content is the same as @xmath18 vector multiplet in four dimensions .",
    "if d3 wraps the same cycle @xmath10 times , the gauge theory is elevated to @xmath19 . for each such d3-branes on @xmath17 , we can associate a fayet - iliopoulos constant @xmath20 such that the low energy effective action carries a term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is auxiliary field in the vector multiplet .",
    "when a pair of such wrapped d3 s , say each wrapping @xmath23 and @xmath24 times , meets at @xmath1 intersections , one find additional chiral multiplets in the bifundamental representation @xmath25 .",
    "such a quiver , which is the simplest possible nontrivial class , is called kronecker quiver .",
    "we have the supersymmetry constraint @xmath26 so we really have only one fi constant , say , @xmath27 . for negative @xmath28",
    "the classical vacuum moduli space is null and so is the witten index . for positive @xmath28 , the moduli space is given as a kaehler quotient , @xmath29 the number of stable bps bound states can be obtained by calculating indices of these quiver quantum mechanics .",
    "furthermore , the theory has @xmath30 r - symmetry , where @xmath31 came from the rotational symmetry of the three spatial direction .",
    "we can refine the indices by turning on the fugacity @xmath32 for @xmath33 of r - symmetry . due to the pioneering work of reineke @xcite and manschot et al .",
    "@xcite , the systematic procedure of evaluating the equivariant indices of mutually co - prime quiver @xmath34 are viable . however , since they are given in terms of very particular sum of partitions of charges , it is hard to examine the large @xmath10 behaviour with those formula .",
    "indices for @xmath35 kronecker quivers are well - documented and also easy to compute directly . note that the complex dimension of the classical higgs moduli space when @xmath36 is @xmath37 this counting is misleading for nonprimitive cases such as @xmath38 , since the noncompact classical moduli spaces open up along the coulomb direction .",
    "direct evaluation of the standard formula leads to fractional quantities , but with more care the true integral index can be computed . with @xmath39 ,",
    "the only primitive case with nonnegative dimension , thus nonempty moduli space , is @xmath40 .",
    "this case generates the most basic wall - crossing pattern , corresponding to the so - called pentagon - identity , and the index is @xmath41    with @xmath42 , there are two classes with nonempty moduli spaces .",
    "the first is @xmath40 with @xmath43 and the second is @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "indices for these can be inferred to the well - known spectrum of @xmath46 seiberg - witten theory , and also have been computed directly by several different methods .",
    "the answers are of course , @xmath47 and @xmath48 seiberg - witten wall - crossing formula implies that there are no other nontrivial indices in this class , meaning also that all nonprimitive kronecker quivers have null ( integral ) index for @xmath35 .",
    "one most effective way to obtain eq .",
    "( [ hyper ] ) is to employ the mutation map , which is beautifully motivated and described in physics and mathematics of wall - crossing .",

    "while the right mutation maps @xmath54_+ \\gamma_k & & \\hbox{otherwise } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the basic assertion is that if we change @xmath55 as well to keep the total @xmath56 fixed , the index remains unchanged .",
    "the mutation is not allowed for any nodes , however . for wall - crossing quivers like this , there are the questions concerning which node can be mutated and which of the two mutations should be taken , and the answers to these questions are rather complicated . because kronecker quivers have only two nodes and because there is only one nonempty chamber , the allowed mutation maps are uniquely fixed in that chamber as @xmath57 under the left and right mutation respectively . with @xmath42 kronecker quivers , for instance , repeated usage of this maps @xmath58 and @xmath59 quivers to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , bringing us somewhat trivially back to eq .",
    "( [ hyper ] ) .",
    "in this note we are mostly concerned with @xmath62 or its mutation equivalent @xmath63 , for @xmath3 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath64 is a sort of watershed in that the asymptotic scaling with @xmath3 is qualitatively different than those with @xmath65 .",
    "this may imply a similar scaling behaviour for @xmath66 , which indicates that @xmath67 quivers have nontrivial bound states for @xmath3 , unlike their counterpart @xmath35 , despite the flat coulombic directions opening up .",
    "the equivariant witten index of interest is @xmath68\\ , \\ ] ] where we fixed the usual sign ambiguity of the index by choosing @xmath69 .",
    "when we do this we should take care to remove the center of mass part of the low energy dynamics , which is to say , to remove one overall @xmath70 decoupled from the rest of the dynamics .",
    "the residue formula above gets contribution from partial choice of set of rank @xmath79 poles which are determined by the definition of the jk - residue . at a singularity where exactly @xmath80 hyperplanes ( each of which is defined by a charge @xmath81 ) meet ,",
    "the definition can be written as @xmath82 where we allowed constant shift of the pole location for notational convenience .",
    "this procedure encounter some technical difficulties when , at a contributing pole , more than @xmath80 such hyperplanes meet resulting in the so - called degenerate cases .",
    "constructive procedures are known to deal with such cases , one of which we will encounter in the appendix .",
    "we concentrate on mutually co - prime @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where our choice of @xmath73 satisfies the regularity condition where the definition of jk - residue for non - degenerate point can be safely applied .",
    "@xcite    in this note , we introduced all allowed chemical potentials , @xmath53 s , to reduce degeneracies as much as possible .",
    "due to a powerful theorem @xcite , dependence on these chemical potential @xmath53 washes out whenever the classical moduli space is compact , which is the case for kronecker quivers with mutually co - prime @xmath83 .",
    "degenerate singularities that can not be resolved this way will be separately addressed in the appendix .",
    "first of all , we examine what this formula implies for the simplest case , @xmath35 . for @xmath39 , since the classical moduli space is empty , we expect @xmath84 except for @xmath85 .",
    "the latter can be easily seen from a simple abelian residue integral .    for @xmath86",
    ", we can show that there is no charge set which contributes to the jk - residue .",
    "first of all , in the appendix , we showed that the charge set which involves vector multiplet can contribute only when @xmath87 .",
    "only , we conjecture that for all values of @xmath1 , when @xmath88 are mutually co - prime , singularities involving vector multiplet does not contribute to the integral . ] hence , under the assumption that @xmath88 are mutually co - prime , the residue integral gets contribution only from poles of chiral multiplets .",
    "suppose we have a set of chiral multiplet charges such that @xmath73 is in a positive cone of the charges .",
    "then all the charges in this set should be connected to each other to meet this assumption , and this implies that they collide at @xmath89 for all @xmath90 s and @xmath1 s .",
    "this immediately produces @xmath91 additional zeros from the vector multiplet numerator where additional degeneracy of the pole is @xmath92 . since @xmath93 when @xmath94",
    ", the number of zeros always exceed that of additional poles .",
    "hence , chiral multiplets can not contribute either .",
    "since there is no singularity which has non - vanishing residue and meets the jk condition , we can say that @xmath95 for all co - prime @xmath23 and @xmath24 as expected .",
    "next , let us consider @xmath34 quivers with @xmath42 , whose indices count the degeneracy of bps spectra in well - known @xmath46 seiberg - witten theory . first of all , the index of @xmath96 quiver can be easily evaluated by adding two residue integrals of chiral multiplet poles , @xmath97 which correctly reproduces spin character of the four - dimensional bps vector multiplet . when @xmath98 , as can be inferred from the argument in the appendix , residue integral gets contribution from the vector multiplet , which again implies the existence of the flat direction in coulomb branch .",
    "for co - prime @xmath23 and @xmath24 , when the index is expected to get contribution only from chiral multiplets , one can show that there are only two non - trivial cases , which are @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "suppose that we turn off all the flavor fugacities .",
    "since all charges which contribute to the residue integral should be connected , the rank @xmath80 singularity is located at @xmath89 for all @xmath90 and @xmath1 . at this point , the order of zeros minus the order of additional poles are given by @xmath101 = ( d_1-d_2)^2 - 1 $ ] .",
    "note that except @xmath102 and @xmath99 , the residue integral will vanish .    for @xmath59 ( and equivalently",
    "@xmath58 ) quiver , we can further show that the only non - trivial residue integral comes from a charge set where each component @xmath75 of the first node appear exactly twice .",
    "the contributing charge set is drawn in figure [ fig:45 ] below .     quiver .",
    "this is only possible non - zero contribution , up to weyl permutation .",
    "the number denotes assignments of flavor fugacity.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    if there exist a component @xmath75 with more than three charges are connected , one can see that the residue always vanishes or does not satisfy the jk - condition .",
    "the residue integral at this fixed point can be readily evaluated .",
    "if we set @xmath103 , it follows that @xmath104 are fixed locus of the above type .",
    "then , from the vector multiplets , we have a factor @xmath105}{\\sinh[((n_1-n_2)(e_1-e_2)+z)/2 ] } \\prod_{\\substack{m_1,m_2=1\\\\m_1\\neq m_2}}^{d}\\frac{\\sinh[(m_1-m_2)(e_1-e_2)/2]}{\\sinh[((m_1-m_2)(e_1-e_2)+z)/2]}\\ , \\ ] ] and from the chiral multiplet , we have @xmath106}{\\sinh[(n - m)(e_1-e_2)/2 ] } \\prod_{\\substack{n , m=1\\\\n\\neq m-1 } } ^{d-1,d}\\frac{\\sinh[((n - m+1)(e_1-e_2)-z)/2]}{\\sinh[(n - m+1)(e_1-e_2)/2]}\\ .\\ ] ] note that if we multiply two contributions , all the @xmath107 factors cancel out each other .",
    "finally we should multiply by @xmath108 which takes into account the contribution from the weyl equivalent fixed points .",
    "we do not sum over @xmath109 , since it can be obtained from left - right flipping of the diagram , which is a part of the weyl group .",
    "hence , we correctly reproduce @xmath110 as expected .      even though general recipe for calculating equivariant indices of the kronecker quiver is well - established , actual evaluation of the residue integral is very complicated when degenerate singularities appear .",
    "however , almost all quivers with @xmath111 turns out to contain such singularity , as can be seen from the naive pole counting after turning off the flavor fugacities .",
    "if degenerate singularities exist , the answer depends crucially on the order of taking each residue , which makes the evaluation for the large rank case very involved .",
    "see appendix or @xcite for how we should deal with of such singularities",
    ".    however , there are special types of two node quiver where we can explicitly show that no degenerate singularity appears even for @xmath111 .",
    "these are the quivers of type @xmath112 .",
    "interestingly , these quivers are known to be mutation dual to quivers of type @xmath0 , where large @xmath10 behaviour of the index has interesting physical consequences @xcite .    especially , when the jk - residue gets contribution only from the non - degenerate poles , the definition of the residue integral reduces to that of ( [ jk ] ) . now",
    ", suppose that we found a set of @xmath113 charges such that @xmath73 is in a positive cone of the charge set .",
    "since they are all simple poles , evaluation of the residue corresponds to simple substitution of these relations defined by @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 s and @xmath117 s are certain linear combinations of the flavor fugacities . then the contribution of this singularity to the residue integral is in the following form : @xmath118}{\\sinh[(f_p(a_i)-f_q(a_i)-z)/2 ] } \\prod_{k\\neq l } \\frac{\\sinh[(g_k(a_i)-g_l(a_i))/2]}{\\sinh[(g_k(a_i)-g_l(a_i)-z)/2]}\\\\ & & \\times \\prod_{f_p\\neq g_k } \\frac{\\sinh[(f_p(a_i)-g_k(a_i)-z)/2]}{\\sinh[(f_p(a_i)-g_k(a_i))/2]}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the pre - fector @xmath119 are cancelled by rank @xmath113 residue integral .",
    "furthermore we multiplied @xmath120 and @xmath121 , taking into account the weyl permutation of the solutions which give rise to the same contribution .",
    "we expect that after we add up contributions from all singularities , flavor fugacity cancels out @xcite and end up with a laurent polynomial in @xmath122 .",
    "interestingly , the limit @xmath123 is well - defined for each of these term and the residue becomes 1 at all such fixed points .",
    "hence , if we concentrate on the value of the witten index only , the problem reduces down to counting number of such set of charges which is in a positive cone of corresponding @xmath73 .",
    "the following section is devoted to the evaluation of the witten index for @xmath2 quiver , by counting all such contributing poles .",
    "from now on , we denote set of _ nodes _ by @xmath124 and @xmath125 which represent each cartans of source and sink of the kronecker quiver respectively . we will call _ contributing arrows _ as a set of rank @xmath113 chiral multiplet charges @xmath126 with specified flavor fugacities which passes jk condition and contributes non - zero value to the witten index .      in this section ,",
    "we focus on the explicit evaluation of the witten index for quivers of type @xmath2 , using the jk - residue formula derived from the path integral . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "the euler number of moduli space of these types of quiver was extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "our formula turns out to agree with these results .",
    "the evaluation is done in the following procedure . for quivers of type @xmath2",
    ", one can show following facts .",

    "* suppose that there exist two charges @xmath126 and @xmath127 with @xmath128 , for a source node @xmath90 of given contributing arrows .",

    "similarly , for a sink node @xmath129 , if there exist two charges @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath128 , this solution does note contribute to the integral .",
    "these three statements are proven in the appendix .",
    "once we have these , the procedure of finding all contributing arrows reduces down to that of @xcite .",
    "we can construct all sets of contributing arrows recursively , by _ gluing _ contributing arrows of the quiver with type @xmath132 , which is defined as follow .    * _ gluing _ : consider two sets of contributing arrows of type @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively .",

    "finally we also prove the following in the appendix .",

    "the numbers on the arrows denote the choice of the flavor fugacities of corresponding arrows .",
    "note that it is crucial to divide by the order of symmetry group of the graph , since it yields weyl equivalent combinations , which we already have taken into account in the calculation of the witten index.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    this procedure can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath10 . if we denote @xmath152 by the number of contributing configuration with @xmath153 sink nodes , it can be obtained via following relation .",
    "@xmath154    where the @xmath90-th term counts the number of ways of attaching @xmath90-many subquivers with @xmath155 sink nodes in total , to the initial quiver of type @xmath139 .",
    "each subquiver can be further decomposed into an arrow ( which is attached to the initial quiver ) and @xmath156 sub - subquivers .",
    "when each of the latter contains @xmath157-many sink nodes respectively , it contributes @xmath158 factor to the @xmath90-th term .",
    "finally , the combinatorial factor @xmath159 for @xmath90-th term takes into account the number of ways of choosing flavor fugacity of arrows attached to the initial quiver , divided by order of the weyl permutation of those .",
    "furthermore , this recursion relation can be neatly summarized by introducing the generating function @xmath160 with an auxiliary variable @xmath161 . then the recursion relation ( [ 42 ] )",
