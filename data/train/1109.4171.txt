    "[ sec : intro ] several microwave experiments , like _ cobe_-dmr @xcite , ovro @xcite , saskatoon @xcite , 19  ghz @xcite or tenerife @xcite , have revealed the presence of a statistical correlation between microwave maps and infrared maps tracing the thermal dust emission .",
    "these observations motivated a search for similar signals in individual regions @xcite , which led to unambiguous detections in several molecular clouds with different experiments , like cosmosomas @xcite , ami @xcite , cbi @xcite , vsa @xcite or planck @xcite .",
    "these studies led to the idea that this dust - correlated signal , which was thenceforth referred to as `` anomalous microwave emission '' ( ame ) , was indeed an additional diffuse foreground component , originated by a emission mechanism different from the well - known synchrotron , free - free and thermal dust emissions .",
    "ame , which is a significant contaminant of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the range @xmath11  ghz , was first thought to be free - free emission from @xmath12  k gas @xcite .",
    "this high temperature would be required to reconcile the observed microwave intensity with the lack of intense h@xmath2 emission , as it would be expected in the case of bremsstrahlung emission with lower gas temperatures .",
    "however , @xcite ruled out such high temperatures on energetic grounds , and proposed electric dipole emission from small rotating dust grains in the interstellar medium ( the so - called _ spinning dust _ ) , a mechanism first proposed by @xcite , as a plausible explanation for ame .",
    "the models provided by @xcite for different media show peaked spectra with maximum emissivities at @xmath13  ghz which reproduce fairly well the observations @xcite .",
    "recently , the previous analytical models have been refined by different groups by introducing more detailed considerations about the grain shapes and their rotational properties @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented an alternative explanation for ame based on magnetic dipole radiation from hot ferromagnetic grains .",
    "models of magnetic dipole emission based on single - domain grains , which predict polarization fractions significantly larger than those of the electric dipole emission @xcite , have been ruled out by different observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative mechanism based on a flat - spectrum synchrotron radiation associated with star formation activity to explain wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) first - year observations .",
    "however , this hypothesis was questioned by other studies .",
    "de oliveira - costa at al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that the spinning dust hypothesis is clearly favored as it can explain the downturn seen in the dust - correlated signal below 20  ghz @xcite , whereas @xcite found significant correlation in regions away from star - forming regions .",
    "more recently @xcite concluded that spinning dust models can fit the arcade data at 3 , 8 and 10  ghz better than the flat - spectrum model .    in this article",
    "we present a study of the ame arising in the pleiades reflection nebula , using data at @xmath14  ghz from the cosmosomas experiment and at @xmath15  ghz from wmap .",
    "this nearby region , having various bright stars capable of exciting the circumstellar medium , is an obvious ame candidate .",
    "its relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath16 ) makes it also attractive as we can largely avoid contamination from the galactic plane .",
    "furthermore , it has been widely studied , there being extensive information in the literature about its physical properties that allow us to better understand and to constrain the ame intensities . as we will see next",
    ", those studies normally refer to different dust substructures located within this region .",
    "however , the low angular resolution ( @xmath17 ) of the microwave data we handle preclude us from studying those individual features , and therefore we will be focused in the whole complex , to which we will refer to as the `` pleiades reflection nebula '' .",
    "[ sec : pleiades ]    the discovery of a reflection nebulosity towards the pleiades star cluster @xcite revealed the presence of interstellar dust in this region .",
    "this dust is reflecting light from hot blue stars in this cluster , especially the bright stars 17 tau , 20 tau , 23 tau and 25 tau , with b - band magnitudes ranging from 2.81 to 4.11 @xcite and respective spectral types b6 iii , b7 iii , b6 iv and b7 iii @xcite .",
    "the pleiades cluster lies within the taurus complex at a distance of 125  pc @xcite , and extends @xmath18 ( @xmath191  pc ) around coordinates r.a.= 3@xmath2046@xmath21 , dec.= 23@xmath047 ( j2000 ) .",
    "@xcite discovered infrared dust emission around the positions of the pleiades stars , which they attribute to nonequilibrium very small grains or to molecules with 10 - 100 carbon atoms .",
    "the brightness distribution of this emission , which extends @xmath17 , and its connection with the exciting stars , can be appreciated in figure  [ dss_iras ] , where we show a dss blue - band image with 100  @xmath5 m iras intensity contours overplotted .",
    "the strong emission @xmath22 south of 23 tau is originated in the merope molecular cloud , identified by @xcite in co maps .",
    "another two bright knots of infrared emission are seen in the iras maps concentrated around the stars 17 tau and 20 tau .     in the region of the pleiades star cluster with iras 100  @xmath5 m data overlaid with contours .",
    "these contours correspond to intensity levels of 20 , 30 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 300  mjy  sr@xmath7 .",
    "arrows point to the positions of the main exciting stars in the region , and the circle indicates the aperture we will use for flux integration . ]    except for the area of the merope molecular cloud , with @xmath23  mag measured in the direction of the background star hd23512 by @xcite , the optical depth in this region is low ( @xmath24  mag ) , and there seem to be little other dust along the cluster line of sight @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the gas in different positions of the whole complex have been studied by different authors .",
    "@xcite obtained gas densities @xmath25  @xmath26 and temperatures @xmath27  k from molecular line observations in the merope molecular cloud .",
    "they found column densities intermediate between diffuse and dark clouds , and concluded that merope is indeed much less opaque than typical taurus clouds .",
    "@xcite studied a larger area in the pleiades enclosing the main exciting stars and estimated densities @xmath28  @xmath26 , whereas @xcite found @xmath29  @xmath26 in a similar area .",
    "@xcite obtained even lower values of @xmath30 , 16 and 40  @xmath26 in the lines of sight of 25 tau , 27 tau and 28 tau , respectively .",
    "different studies , based on co maps @xcite and on high - resolution spectra towards pleiades stars @xcite , have shown the gas and dust that make up the pleiades nebula to have a significant radial velocity offset relative to the star cluster .",
    "a corollary of this is that the pleiades stars were not formed out of this surrounding material but , more likely , the spatial association between the stars and the interstellar gas is the result of a chance encounter between the cluster and one or more approaching clouds .",
    "@xcite identified two separated phases : one layer of atomic gas with ( local standard of rest ) radial velocity of 7  km  s@xmath7 , lying @xmath31  pc in front of the cluster and with thickness of @xmath32  pc , and one molecular phase ( though strongly ionized ) with radial velocity of 10  km  s@xmath7 within the cluster .",
    "the presence of these two phases was confirmed by latter studies , which also showed that the atomic phase probably belongs to the taurus clouds , but are inconclusive on whether or not the molecular phase is embedded within the star cluster @xcite .",
    "[ sec : ff_est ] the radio free - free emission must be accurately characterized in order to quantify any possible dust - correlated excess at microwave frequencies . to this aim",
    "we follow the method described in @xcite , which allows to estimate the level of this emission from h@xmath2 .",
    "we resort to the full - sky h@xmath2 map compiled by @xcite , a patch of which is shown in figure  [ maps_ff ] in the region of the pleiades reflection nebula .",
    "the solid circle depicts the 1@xmath0 aperture we will use in this work for flux integration , while the area limited by the two dashed circles at radii 1.7@xmath0 and 2.0@xmath0 define the annulus where we will average the background signal that will be subtracted .",
    "however , in this case it is evident that this annulus would not give a reliable estimation of the background , as it contains clear contaminant signal rather different from the true background level around the pleiades clouds .",
    "in fact , the averaged signal is larger in the background annulus than in the aperture , giving a negative background - subtracted h@xmath2 intensity of @xmath33  r. when positioning the background annulus at different radii between 1.0@xmath0 and 3.0@xmath0 we consistently get negative values between @xmath34  r and @xmath35  r. therefore , from an aperture integration here we can only set upper limits on the h@xmath2 emission .",
    "instead , we choose to proceed in a different way .    inside the aperture",
    "the only evident signal above the background level is a bright h@xmath2 knot located @xmath36 south of 23 tau and coincident with the position of the merope molecular cloud . on these grounds",
    "we consider that all the h@xmath2 emission associated with the pleiades nebula is produced in this position . in order to calculate its associated intensity",
    "we fit this feature with a two - dimensional elliptical gaussian function plus a constant background level .",
    "we obtain a maximum amplitude ( source plus background ) of 5.90  r , a background level of 2.58  r , and fwhm of 14.3 and 20.7 in two orthogonal directions .",
    "using these parameters the mean background - subtracted h@xmath2 intensity in the aperture is @xmath37  r. note that this value is higher than the 3-sigma upper limit obtained through aperture photometry .",
    "therefore , it is more conservative , as it will be extrapolated to microwave frequencies in order to characterize any possible excess emission in that range .",
    "this value needs correction from galactic extinction , @xmath38 . using @xcite polynomials that allow calculating the extinction at",
    "any given wavelength in the range @xmath39 m , and taking @xmath40 from @xcite , we obtain @xmath41(h@xmath2)@xmath42 .",
    "ideally we should apply a pixel by pixel correction , for which we would need a reddening map .",
    "we have inspected the @xcite full - sky @xmath43 map in this region , which gives a mean reddening inside the aperture of 0.30  mag , with a maximum of 2.06  mag in a position @xmath22 south of 23 tau , coincident with the merope molecular cloud . @xcite give reddening values towards twenty stars belonging to the pleiades ( taken from white et al .",
    "2001 ) , with an average value of 0.074  mag , and a maximum of 0.35  mag towards the star hd23512 .",
    "these figures are consistent with other measurements in the direction of pleiades or background stars @xcite .",
    "the reddenings from the @xcite map correspond to the full integral along the line of sight , and therefore their higher values could be due to the extinction produced in background dust .",
    "however , given the relatively high galactic latitude of the pleiades , one would expect those differences to be smaller .",
    "therefore , instead of performing a pixel by pixel correction , we conservatively assume an average value of @xmath44 , which is slightly larger than the mean over the twenty stars of @xcite .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath45  r , and assuming an electron temperature of 8000  k , we obtain an emission measure of @xmath46  @xmath47  pc . from this , we derive the expected spectrum of free - free flux integrated over the aperture .",
    "[ sec : radio ]    there are different radio surveys from which we can also constrain the free - free emission .",
    "we use the @xcite map at 0.408  ghz , the @xcite map at 0.820  ghz and the @xcite map at 1.4  ghz .",
    "( @xmath48 . ) . in the case of the 0.820  ghz data we carried out the re - pixelization ourselves , as they are given in a different format .",
    "] these maps smoothed to a common resolution of 1@xmath0 ( except the 0.820  ghz map , whose original resolution is 1.2@xmath0 ) in the position of the pleiades are shown in figure  [ maps_ff ] .",
    "no obvious excess above the background and noise levels is seen , so we have to establish upper limits for the flux densities at these frequencies .",
    "to this aim , we assume the noise per pixel to be equal to the standard deviation of the signal calculated in the background region ( external annulus ) of the maps smoothed to 1@xmath0 .",
    "the flux noises in the aperture derived from this assumption are respectively 0.38 , 0.30 and 0.17  jy ( 68% c.l . ;",
    "in table  [ fluxes ] we show upper limits at the 99.7% c.l . ) , while the free - free fluxes estimated from h@xmath2 ( see previous section ) at those frequencies are at a level of @xmath49  jy .        [ sec : cosmosomas ] the cosmosomas ( _ cosmo_logical _ s_tructures _ o_n _ m_edium _ a_ngular _ s_cales ) experiment consisted of two circular - scanning instruments , so - called cosmo11 and cosmo15 , operative between 1998 and 2008 from the teide observatory ( altitude 2400  m , tenerife ) .",
    "they produced 0.8 - 1.1@xmath0 resolution daily maps with full coverage in right ascension and @xmath1920@xmath0 coverage in declination in four frequency bands centered at 10.9  ghz for cosmo11 , and 12.7 , 14.7 and 16.3  ghz for cosmo15 .",
    "a description of the instrumental setup of cosmo11 and cosmo15 can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "an important step of the data processing is the removal of the first seven harmonics of each scan , in order to suppress the @xmath50 noise from the receiver and from the atmosphere .",
    "each scan , which is a stack of 30  s of data ( corresponding to 30  spins of the primary mirror ) , is fourier - fitted and terms up to seventh order ( i.e. a constant term plus seven sin and cos terms ) are removed .",
    "this results in a distortion of the broad angular scales and in a loss of flux .",
    "further details on the data reduction , calibration and map - making of cosmo11 and cosmo15 data can be found in @xcite and in @xcite , respectively . in those references",
    "the final maps can be seen , as well as the discussion about the dust - correlated signal that was found at @xmath51 .",
    "the maps we use here are a stack of @xmath52  days of observations in each of the two linear polarization modes of cosmo11 ( november 2003 to june 2005 ) and of @xmath53  days of cosmo15 data ( october 1999 to january 2000 ) .",
    "they are convolved to a common resolution of 1.12@xmath0 , and have final sensitivities ( averaged over the @xmath5410,000 square - degree observed sky region ) of 35  @xmath5k  beam@xmath7 for cosmo11 , and 53 , 56 and 118  @xmath5k  beam@xmath7 for the three frequencies of cosmo15 .",
    "cosmo11 and cosmo15 observed in different configurations , covering different declination ranges .",
    "the minimum declination was @xmath55 . in the case of cosmo15 , there are also @xmath195 days in a configuration down to dec.=16.7@xmath0 , but we discard these data because of being too noisy .",
    "most of the area encompassed by the pleiades reflection nebula is covered by the observations , but unfortunately its center lies just 17 from the border of the map . also , the total number of days of observations in the configurations reaching these low declinations are @xmath56 for cosmo11 and @xmath57 for cosmo15 . however , despite the fewer observing days , the maps sensitivities in the region of the pleiades are similar to the full - map average sensitivities quoted above thanks to the circular scanning strategy , which results in a better spatial coverage towards the edge of the map .",
    "possible edge effects arisen in this region are avoided by ignoring the blank pixels in the convolution process .",
    "cosmosomas maps in the region of the pleiades are shown in figure  [ maps_cosmo ] .",
    "no clear detection is seen in any of the frequency bands .",
    "marginal evidence for a weak signal in the position of the pleiades could be claimed in the cosmo11 map .",
    "we obtain an indirect estimate of @xmath58  jy for the 11  ghz flux from the dirbe fluxes calculated in section  [ sec : fir ] , by using the dust - correlated emissivities between the cosmo11 map and the dirbe 100 , 140 and 240  @xmath5 m maps .",
    "however , we conservatively establish flux upper limits for cosmo11 and for the three cosmo15 frequencies , which will in turn be important to trace the ame flux downturn at lower frequencies predicted by spinning - dust models .",
    "to this aim we measure the standard deviation in each map within a box of @xmath59  square  degrees around the pleiades , obtaining 65 , 96 , 65 and 72  @xmath5k  beam@xmath7 for 10.9 , 12.7 , 14.7 and 16.3  ghz , respectively .",
    "after transforming to flux , these values are corrected for the flux suppression caused by the cosmosomas map - making strategy described above . to this aim",
    ", we simulate a source with the same brightness distribution as the 100  @xmath5 m dirbe map in the position of the pleiades , and a flux normalized to 1  jy .",
    "this source is then degraded to an angular resolution of 1.12@xmath0 , and convolved with the simulated circular scanning strategy of cosmosomas , which includes removal of the first seven harmonics . by measuring the flux in this final map , and comparing with the initial flux of 1  jy , we conclude that the flux losses are 62% and 66% respectively for cosmo11 and cosmo15 .",

    "the position of the peak of the spinning dust spectrum is very sensitive to the intensity of the radiation field .",
    "for the molecular phase , which is probably associated with the merope molecular cloud , we select a low value of @xmath120 , in order to have the peak at @xmath121  ghz , matching the wmap k - band flux , which is our maximum measured value .",
    "@xcite have calculated the intensity of the radiation field in different lines of sight towards the pleiades ; from their values ( see their table  6 ) in positions within our aperture we calculate an average of @xmath122 . using this value and a hydrogen density of @xmath123  @xmath26 (",
    "also calculated from an average of their measurements ) , and same values for the rest of the spdust.2 input parameters , we obtain a spinning dust spectrum which peaks at 36.9  ghz and provides a very poor fit to the data .",
    "if we use for the hydrogen number density a value as low as @xmath124  @xmath26 , while maintaining the same radiation field intensity , the spectrum peaks at a lower value of 31  ghz , still far from the observed peak around 22.8  ghz .",
    "therefore , in order to reliably fit the data , we have to decrease the intensity of the radiation field for the molecular phase .",
    "note however that @xcite do not provide measurements for the radiation field in any position towards the merope molecular cloud , and therefore it could be the case that its intensity is indeed lower .",
    "on the other hand , for the atomic phase , which probably traces a more diffuse component scattered around the clouds , we adopt @xmath125 , which is closer to the values reported by @xcite , and also provides a better fit to the 60.8  ghz point .",
    "once we have obtained the spinning dust spectra for the molecular and atomic phases from spdust.2 , their amplitudes , which are defined by the hydrogen column densities @xmath107 , are fitted to the measured fluxes .",

    "therefore , in this case we also fit to the data a cmb component with an average temperature @xmath111 , and neglect the spinning - dust corresponding to the atomic gas phase , as it would be completely overshadowed by the cmb component . after subtracting the free - free flux corresponding to each frequency , we jointly fit , using a non - linear least - squares method , our five model parameters , @xmath107 , @xmath111 , @xmath110 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , defining the spinning - dust , cmb and thermal dust components , to the wmap and dirbe fluxes . in case",
    "b ( figure  [ sed_nocmb ] ) , we fit the hydrogen column density associated with the spinning - dust atomic phase instead of @xmath111 , as the cmb has been removed directly from the map .",
    "the fitted parameters and their errors are shown in table  [ parameters ] , and the spectra of all components are represented in figures  [ sed_cmb ] and [ sed_nocmb ] .",
    "we see that these fitted spectra are indeed fully compatible with the cosmosomas 3-sigma upper limits .",
    "the reduced chi - squares are 0.75 and 6.76 for cases a and b , respectively .",
    "the dust temperature is somewhat higher in case b , with the spectrum being steeper in case a. this is a consequence of @xmath111 in case b being slightly larger than the average ilc temperature within the aperture , 30.2  @xmath5k , which is the effective cmb level that we are subtracting in case a prior to flux calculation .",
    "the fitted values for the hydrogen column densities are compatible in both cases .",
    "these values show that the pleiades reflection nebula constitute indeed a more diffuse media than others were ame have been usually studied , like the perseus and @xmath128 ophiuchus molecular clouds , where @xmath129  @xmath130 and @xmath131  @xmath130 respectively @xcite .",
    "this also becomes evident from the reddening measurements in this region , @xmath44  mag ( see section  [ sec : ff_est ] ) , which are typical of diffuse clouds , and lower than the respective values in the perseus and @xmath128 ophiuchus molecular clouds , and even lower than the reddening of the translucent cloud ldn1780 , @xmath132 , where @xcite recently found ame .",
    "our fitted values for the hydrogen column densities are also of the same order of those derived by applying the scaling relation of @xcite , ( @xmath133  @xmath130  mag@xmath7 , and taking for the reddening @xmath44  mag .",
    "it may also be noted that by dividing the fitted hydrogen column density of the molecular phase by the hydrogen number density , we get an estimate for the depth of the cloud of @xmath134  pc , a value that agrees with the characteristic length scale of this cloud .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results with those presented in figure  13 of @xcite , where they plot emissivity at 31  ghz ( intensity at 31 ghz divided by hydrogen column density ) versus hydrogen column density . dividing the total flux at 33  ghz for case b by the solid angle of the aperture and by the corresponding fitted column density we get @xmath135  mjy  sr@xmath7  @xmath136 . in order to scale to 31  ghz",
    "we use our fitted model , and obtain @xmath137  mjy  sr@xmath7  @xmath136 .",
    "this value roughly follows the trend shown in that figure , but falls below the fitted line , which for @xmath138  @xmath130 predicts @xmath139  mjy  sr@xmath7  @xmath136 .",
    "it therefore seems that the pleiades nebula , in addition to having a notable lower hydrogen column density to the regions shown in that figure , and actually to the majority of the regions where ame has been previously detected , also has a lower emissivity per hydrogen nucleon .",
    "the residual fluxes , obtained after subtracting all modelled components except the spinning - dust are quoted in table  [ fluxes ] and plotted in bottom panels of figures  [ sed_cmb ] and [ sed_nocmb ] . according to our fitted model for case",
    "b , the thermal dust contributes at 22.8  ghz with a flux of 0.012  jy , whereas the level of the free - free at this frequency was 0.019  jy .",
    "then , the residual flux at this frequency , which can be attributed to ame , is 2.12@xmath1400.12  jy ( 17.7@xmath4 ; modelling errors included ) .",
    "we have presented evidence for anomalous microwave emission in the position of the nearby ( 125  pc ) pleiades star cluster , one of the most studied regions in the sky .",
    "this ame is originated in the dust grains that make up the pleiades reflection nebula , whose thermal infrared emission was discovered by @xcite .",
    "using data from the seven - year release of wmap , here we have measured a total flux density towards this nebulosity of @xmath1  jy at 22.8  ghz by applying an aperture integration in a 1@xmath0-radius circle around the position ( r.a.,dec.)=@xmath141 ( j2000 ) . cosmosomas maps at 11 - 17  ghz do not show evidence for emission at this position .",
    "nevertheless , we have set upper limits ( 99.7% c.l . ) of 0.94  jy at 10.9  ghz and 1.58  jy at 13.6  ghz , which help to trace the downturn of the ame spectrum at these frequencies predicted by models based on electric dipole emission from fast - spinning dust grains .    in order to quantify the total ame flux we have considered other emission mechanisms .",
    "we have estimated a free - free flux of 0.019  jy , at the same reference frequency of 22.8  ghz , from the h@xmath2 map of @xcite , which has been previously corrected from galactic extinction by using reddening values measured towards different stars .",
    "infrared fluxes obtained from the cobe - dirbe experiment have been used to trace the thermal dust emission , from which we extrapolate to microwave frequencies and obtain a flux of 0.012  jy .",
    "therefore , both the free - free and thermal dust emissions have little impact in our measurement . after deducting these two components we have obtained a residual flux of @xmath3  jy , which is a detection of ame at the 17.7@xmath4 level .",
    "the signal at 22.8  ghz is slightly resolved by wmap k - band beam ( 0.85@xmath0 fwhm ) .",
    "this indicates that , although the bulk of the emission is probably coming from the region near the stars 23 tau and 17 tau , where the strongest infrared emission is also detected , there is probably an important diffuse component integrated over the whole nebulosity .",
    "observations with microwave experiments at higher angular resolution are crucial to elucidate the relative contribution to the total observed flux of the different individual clouds that constitute the pleiades reflection nebula .",
    "they may also help to better trace the correlation with the thermal dust , and to shed light on the properties of the grain population that may be originating this ame .",
    "after deducting the extrapolated free - free fluxes , we have fitted a joint model consisting of a modified blackbody spectrum , tracing the thermal dust emission , and a spinning - dust spectrum which traces the ame , to the wmap and dirbe fluxes . for the spinning - dust component",
    "we have considered two complementary phases , one dominated by high - density molecular gas and the other by lower - density atomic gas .",
    "their spinning - dust spectra have been obtained with spdust.2 , by using realistic values for the physical parameters that are inputs to this code .",
    "we then fitted the amplitude of the spectra to the data , together with the three parameters that define the thermal dust model .",
    "the resulting spinning - dust fit successfully traces the wmap and dirbe data , while being compatible with the cosmosomas upper limits .",
    "microwave temperatures at 22.8  ghz are clearly correlated with 100  @xmath5 m infrared intensities , the dust emissivity being @xmath6  @xmath5k/(mjy  sr@xmath7 ) .",
    "this value is lower than what is typical in cool dust clouds , and more characteristic of hii regions .",
    "the physical properties of the pleiades nebula show that this is a much less opaque medium than others where ame has been generally studied , the reason for this detection likely being its proximity .",
    "for instance , the optical depth and the hydrogen column density of the perseus molecular cloud are more than an order of magnitude higher @xcite , which explains why the ame flux at 22.8  ghz is there twenty times larger than in the pleiades despite being at twice their distance .",
    "this potentially makes the pleiades an attractive environment to study the ame emission in different physical conditions than those generally explored up to now .",
