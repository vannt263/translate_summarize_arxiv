    "is used ; for many fields , it is equivalent to ( iv ) .    however , to perform elliptic curve cryptography ( ecc ) on a non - singular cubic curve it is really not necessary to assume that the curve has an inflexion .",
    "this then widens the choice of the curve that is used for the encryption . if only non - singular cubics with more than one inflexion point are considered then , since an inflexion point other than the zero has order 3 and the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group , this restricts to curves whose group size is divisible by 3 .",
    "given two irreducible curves @xmath4 , an _ isomorphism _ from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is an invertible polynomial transformation ; it induces an isomorphism of their function fields .",

    "two non - singular cubics , both with at least one inflexion , are isomorphic if and only if there is a projective transformation between them .",
    "so to classify non - singular cubics up to isomorphism is equivalent to classifying non - singular cubics with an inflexion up to projective transformation .    given a non - singular cubic with an inflexion ,",
    "when the field @xmath2 has characteristic other than two , co - ordinates may be chosen so that the line at infinity contains an inflexion point and the curve is normalised to the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 has degree 3 .",
    "canonical forms for these cubics are given in section [ subsec6.3 ] .",
    "however , there do exist non - singular cubic curves having no inflexion point ; see section [ subsec6.4 ] .    also , in this paper , a modification of the usual version of elliptic curve cryptography",
    "is suggested .",
