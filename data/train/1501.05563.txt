    "queueing systems with retrials are characterized by the fact that arriving customers , who find the server busy , do not wait in an ordinary queue . instead of",
    "that they go into an orbit , retrying to obtain service after a random amount of time .",
    "these systems have received considerable attention in the literature , see e.g. the book by falin and templeton @xcite , and the more recent book by artalejo and gomez - corral @xcite .",
    "polling systems are queueing models in which a single server , alternatingly , visits a number of queues in some prescribed order .",
    "polling systems , too , have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "for example , various different service disciplines ( rules which describe the server s behaviour while visiting a queue ) and both models with and without switchover times have been considered .",
    "we refer to takagi @xcite and vishnevskii and semenova @xcite for some literature reviews and to boon , van der mei and winands @xcite , levy and sidi @xcite and takagi @xcite for overviews of the applicability of polling systems .    in this paper , motivated by questions regarding the performance modelling of optical networks , we consider vacation and polling systems with retrials .",
    "despite the enormous amount of literature on both types of models , there are hardly any papers having both the features of retrials of customers and of a single server polling a number of queues .",
    "in fact , the authors are only aware of a sequence of papers by langaris @xcite on this topic . in all these papers",
    "the author determines the mean number of retrial customers in the different stations . in @xcite",
    "the author studies a model in which the server , upon polling a station , stays there for an exponential period of time and if a customer asks for service before this time expires , the customer is served and a new exponential stay period at the station begins . in @xcite",
    "the author studies a model with two types of customers : primary customers and secondary customers .",
    "primary customers are all customers present in the station at the instant the server polls the station .",
    "secondary customers are customers who arrive during the sojourn time of the server in the station .",
    "the server , upon polling a station , first serves all the primary customers present and after that stays an exponential period of time to wait for and serve secondary customers .",
    "finally , in @xcite the author considers a model with markovian routing and stations that could be either of the type of @xcite or of the type of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a polling station with retrials and so - called _ glue _ periods .",
    "just before the server arrives at a station there is some deterministic glue period .",
    "customers ( both new arrivals and retrials ) arriving at the station during this glue period `` stick '' and will be served during the visit of the server . customers arriving in any other period leave immediately and will retry after an exponentially distributed time .",
    "our study of queueing systems with retrials and glue periods was at first instance motivated by questions regarding the performance modelling and analysis of optical networks .",
    "optical fibre offers some big advantages for communication w.r.t .",
    "copper cables : huge bandwidth , ultra - low losses , and an extra dimension  the wavelength of light .",
    "performance analysis of optical networks is a challenging topic ( see e.g. maier @xcite and rogiest @xcite ) . in a telecommunication network",
    ", packets must be routed from source to destination , passing through a series of routers and switches . in copper - based transmission links , packets from different sources are time - multiplexed .",
    "this is often modeled by a single server polling system . in optical switches ,",
    "too , one has the need for a protocol to decide which packet may be transmitted .",
    "one might again use a cyclic polling strategy , cyclic meaning that there is a fixed pattern for giving service to particular ports / stations .",
    "however , unlike electronics , buffering of optical packets is not easy , as photons can not be stopped .",
    "whenever there is a need to buffer photons , they are made to move locally in fiber loops .",
    "these fiber loops or fiber delay lines ( fdl ) originate and end at the head of a switch .",
    "when a photon arrives at the switch at a time it can not be served , it is sent into an fdl , thereby incurring a small delay to its time of arrival without getting lost or displaced .",
    "depending on the availability , requirement , traffic , size of photon and other such factors , the length ( delay produced ) of these fdls can differ .",
    "hence we assume that these fdls delay the photons by a random amount of time . also , if a packet does not receive service after a cycle through an fdl , then depending on the model it can go into either the same or a longer or a shorter or randomly to any of the available fdls .",
    "hence we assume that two consecutive retrials are independent of each other .",
    "this fdl feature can be modelled by a retrial queue .",
    "a sophisticated technology that one might try to add to this is varying the speed of light by changing the refractive index of the fiber loop , cf .",
    "@xcite . by increasing the refractive index in a small part of the loop we can achieve `",
    "slow light ' , which implies slowing the packets .",
    "when a port ` knows ' that it will soon be served , it may start the process of increasing the refractive index at fdls and at the end of fibers of incoming packets . by doing this",
    ", it slows down the packets which arrive at the station just before the visit period of the station begins .",
    "this feature is , in our model , incorporated as glue periods immediately before the visit period of the corresponding station .",
    "packets arriving in this glue period can be served in that subsequent visit period .",
    "the concept of glue period is , to the best of our knowledge , new in polling systems .",
    "it may also be interpreted as a _ reservation _ period .",
    "we view a reservation period as a period in which customers can make a reservation at a station for service in the subsequent visit period of that station . in our case , such a reservation period occurs immediately before the visit period , and could be viewed as the last part , @xmath0 , of a switchover period of length @xmath1 .",
    "ordinary gated polling could be viewed as a service discipline in which it is always possible to make a reservation for the following visit period .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are the following .",
    "( i ) for the case of a single queue with vacations and glue periods , we provide a detailed queue - length analysis at particular embedded epochs and at an arbitrary epoch .",
    "we also show how to choose the length of the glue period that minimizes the mean number of customers in the system . ( ii )",
    "we also provide a detailed queue - length analysis for the @xmath2-queue polling case ",
    "again at particular embedded epochs and at an arbitrary epoch .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : n=1 ] we consider the case of a single queue with vacations and retrials ; arrivals and retrials only `` stick '' during a glue period .",
    "we study this case separately because ( i ) it is of interest in its own right , ( ii ) it allows us to explain the analytic approach as well as the probabilistic meaning of the main components in considerable detail , ( iii ) it makes the analysis of the multi - queue case more accessible , and ( iv ) results for the one - queue case may serve as a first - order approximation for the behaviour of a particular queue in the @xmath2-queue case , switchover periods now also representing glue and visit periods at other queues . in section  [ sec :",
    "n = n ] the @xmath2-queue case is analyzed .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] presents some conclusions and suggestions for future research .",
    "in this section we consider a single queue @xmath3 in isolation .",
    "customers arrive at @xmath3 according to a poisson process with rate @xmath4 .",
    "the service times of successive customers are independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables ( r.v . ) , with distribution @xmath5 and laplace - stieltjes transform ( lst ) @xmath6 . a generic service time is denoted by @xmath7 . after a visit period of the server at @xmath3 it takes a vacation .",
    "successive vacation lengths are i.i.d .",
    "r.v . , with @xmath8 a generic vacation length , with distribution @xmath9 and lst @xmath10 .",
    "we make all the usual independence assumptions about interarrival times , service times and vacation lengths at the queues . after the server s vacation , a _ glue _ period of deterministic ( i.e. , constant ) length begins .",
    "its significance stems from the following assumption .",
    "customers who arrive at @xmath3 do not receive service immediately .",
    "when customers arrive at @xmath3 during a glue period @xmath11 , they stick , joining the queue of @xmath3 .",
    "when they arrive in any other period , they immediately leave and retry after a retrial interval which is independent of everything else , and which is exponentially distributed with rate @xmath12 . the glue period is immediately followed by a visit period of the server at @xmath3 .",
    "the service discipline at @xmath3 is gated : during the visit period at @xmath3 , the server serves all `` glued '' customers in that queue , i.e. , all customers waiting at the end of the glue period ( but none of those in orbit , and neither any new arrivals ) .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state behaviour of this vacation model with retrials .",
    "we hence make the assumption that @xmath13 ; it may be verified that this is indeed the condition for this steady - state behaviour to exist .    some more notation : + @xmath14 denotes the @xmath15th glue period of @xmath3 .",
    "+ @xmath16 denotes the @xmath15th visit period of @xmath3 ( immediately following the @xmath15th glue period ) .",

    "+ @xmath18 denotes the number of customers in the system ( hence in orbit ) at the start of @xmath14 .",
    "+ @xmath19 denotes the number of customers in the system at the start of @xmath16 .",
    "notice that here we should distinguish between those who are queueing and those who are in orbit : we write @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes queueing and @xmath22 denotes in orbit .",
    "+ finally , + @xmath23 denotes the number of customers in the system ( hence in orbit ) at the start of @xmath17 .      in this subsection",
    "we study the steady - state distributions of the numbers of customers at the beginning of ( i ) glue periods ,",

    "typically , one may view customers who newly arrive into the system during a service as children of the served customer ( `` branching '' ) , and customers who newly arrive into the system during a vacation or glue period as immigrants . such a functional equation may be solved by iteration , giving rise to an infinite product  where the @xmath42th term in the product typically corresponds to customers who descend from an ancestor of @xmath42 generations before . in this particular case",

    "if @xmath336 is very small , that last term will be dominant .",
    "if it is not very small whereas , e.g. , the second moments of the service times are large , then the extra term is relatively small  and the advantage for the system operator of having to offer only very limited reservation opportunities may outweigh the fact that waiting times and queue lengths become slightly larger .",

    "in this paper we have studied vacation queues and @xmath2-queue polling models with the gated service discipline and with retrials .",
    "motivated by optical communications , we have introduced a glue period just before a server visit ; during such a glue period , new customers and retrials `` stick '' instead of immediately going into orbit . for both the vacation queue and the @xmath2-queue polling model , we have derived steady - state queue length distributions at an arbitrary epoch and at various specific epochs .",
    "this was accomplished by establishing a relation to branching processes .    jointly with b. kim and j. kim , in @xcite",

    "we show that a workload decomposition and pseudo conservation law , as discussed in @xcite and remark  [ rm7 ] , can be derived for these variants and generalizations , and they may be exploited for analysis and optimization purposes .",
    "we shall then also try to explore the following observation : one may view our @xmath2-queue model as a polling model with a new variant of binomial gated , with adaptive probability @xmath350 of serving a customer at a visit of @xmath165 ; @xmath351 when the customer arrived in the preceding glue period , and @xmath352 otherwise .",
    "we would also like to explore the possibility to study the heavy traffic behavior of these models via the relation to branching processes , cf .",
    "@xcite .    from a more applied perspective",
    "we are looking into systems with multiple customer classes where one class has priority over another .",
    "this would help to incorporate the real life scenario where some type of data packets , like video buffering , should have as low latency as possible , whereas others , like a file transfer , can be delayed a bit longer .",
    "finally , we would like to point out an important advantage of optical fibre : the wavelength of light .",
    "a fibre - based network node may thus route incoming packets not only by switching in the time - domain , but also by wavelength division multiplexing . in queueing terms",
    ", this gives rise to _ multiserver _ polling models , each server representing a wavelength .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the stability analysis of multiserver polling models , and to @xcite for a mean field approximation of large passive optical networks .",
