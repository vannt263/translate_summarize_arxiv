    "the idea of reptation was introduced about thirty years ago by de gennes @xcite in order to explain some dynamical properties of polymer melts of high molecular weight .",
    "the dynamics of such systems is strongly influenced by entanglement effects between the long polymer chains .",
    "the basic idea of reptation is that each polymer is constrained to move within a topological tube due to the presence of the confining surrounding polymers @xcite . within this tube",
    "the polymer performs a snake - like motion and advances in the melt through the diffusion of stored length along its own contour .",
    "one focuses thus on the motion of a single test chain , while the rest of the environment is considered frozen , i.e. as formed by a network of fixed obstacles .",
    "the reptation theory predicts that the viscosity @xmath10 and longest relaxation time @xmath0 ( known as _ renewal _ time ) scale as @xmath11 , where @xmath3 is the length of the chains , while the diffusion constant scales as @xmath12 .",
    "these results are not far from the experimental findings .",
    "measurements of viscosity of concentrated polymer solutions and melts of different chemical composition and nature are all consistent with a scaling @xmath13 @xcite , while for the diffusion constant both @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite have been reported .",
    "this discrepancy triggered a substantial effort in order to reconcile theory and experiments .",
    "another physical situation where reptation occurs is in _ gel electrophoresis _",
    ", where charged polymers diffuse through the pores of a gel under the influence of a driving electric field @xcite .",
    "the gel particles form a frozen network of obstacles in which the polymer moves through the diffusion of stored length .",
    "electrophoresis has important practical applications , for instance in dna sequencing , since it is a technique which allows to separate polymers according to their length .",
    "the previous examples demonstrate how reptation is an important mechanism for polymer dynamics in different physical situations . a prominent role in understanding the subtle details of the dynamics",
    "was played by models defined on the lattice , which besides describing correctly the process at the microscopic level , offer important computational advantages .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate in detail one of such lattice models , which was originally introduced by rubinstein @xcite and later extended by duke @xcite in order to include the effect of an external driving field .",
    "the rubinstein - duke ( rd ) model has been studied in the past using several techniques ; there are a limited numbers of exact results available @xcite while a rich literature on simulation results on the model exists .",
    "the latter have been mostly obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "mc simulations are tedious for long chains since the renewal time scales as @xmath15 , thus it is difficult to obtain a small statistical error for large @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we study the rd model by means of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , a technique which has been quite successful in recent years , in particular in application to condensed matter problems as quantum spin chains and low - dimensional strongly correlated systems @xcite . using the formal similarity between the master equation for reptation and the schrdinger equation",
    ", dmrg also allows to calculate accurately stationary state properties of long reptating chains .",
    "some of the results reported here , in particular concerning the scaling of the renewal time @xmath0 , have been presented before @xcite . here",
    "we will give full account of the details of the calculations and present a series of new results concerning reptation in the presence of an electric field .",
    "one of the main conclusions of our investigation is that the exponents describing the scaling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the intermediate length region appear to be rather sensitive on the structure of the end repton .",
    "we find that , by influencing the end repton dynamics , one has a regime where the effective exponents are considerably _ lower _ than the standardly found experimental values .",
    "experiments are suggested , involving polymer architectures not investigated so far , and which ought to confirm our predictions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : repton ] we introduce the rd model , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmrg ] we briefly outline the basic ideas of dmrg .",
    "[ sec : zero_field ] is dedicated to the properties of reptation in absence of an external field , in particular to the scaling properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ sec : field ] collects a series of results of reptation in a field , while sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] concludes our paper .",
    "in the rd model the polymer is divided into @xmath3 units , called reptons , which are placed at the sites of a @xmath16-dimensional hypercubic lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the number of reptons that each site can accommodate is unlimited and self - avoidance effects are neglected .",
    "each configuration is projected onto an axis along the ( body ) diagonal of the unit cell and it is identified by the relative coordinates @xmath17 of neighboring reptons along the chain ( @xmath18 indicates the projected coordinate of the @xmath19-th repton ) .",
    "the relative coordinates can take three values @xmath20 and there are thus in total @xmath21 different configurations for a chain with @xmath3 reptons .    0.2truecm    when two or more reptons accumulate at the same lattice site they form a part of stored length , which can then diffuse along the chain",
    ". in terms of relative coordinates a segment of stored length corresponds to @xmath22 , therefore allowed moves are interchanges of @xmath23 s and @xmath24 s , i.e. @xmath25 . on the contrary , the end reptons of the chain can stretch ( @xmath26 ) or retract to the site occupied by the neighboring repton ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the chain is fully specified once the rates for the moves are given .",
    "a field @xmath28 along the projection axes is introduced so that moves forward and backward in the field occur with rates @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the following",
    "we will be interested in both cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 . notice that when an end repton moves towards an empty lattice site ( tube renewal process ) it has in total @xmath16 different possibilities of doing so forward and backward in the field ( see fig . [ fig01 ] ) , therefore the associated rates are @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "on the contrary the end repton can retract by moving to the ( unique ) site occupied by its neighbor with rate @xmath35 or @xmath36 . summarizing the possible moves",
    "are : ( a ) stored length diffusion for inner segments , i.e. ( @xmath37 ) with rates @xmath35 and @xmath36 , ( b ) contractions for external reptons ( @xmath27 ) with rates @xmath35 and @xmath36 and ( c ) stretches for external reptons ( @xmath26 ) , with rates @xmath33 and @xmath34 . notice that the parameter @xmath16 enters in the model only at the stretching rates ( c ) . rather than linking @xmath16 to the lattice coordination number we interpret it as the ratio between stretching rates and rates associated to moves of inner reptons .",
    "this allows to choose any positive values for @xmath16 .",
    "0.2truecm    as we will see , a variation of @xmath16 has some important effects on the corrections to the asymptotic behavior .",
    "this regime may turn out to be relevant for the experiments .",
    "moreover it is conceivable that the parameter @xmath16 could be somewhat modified in an experiment .",
    "figure [ fig02 ] schematically illustrates a possibility of doing so , namely by attaching to the chain ends some large molecules so that for each chain tube renewal moves would be impeded .",
    "the same effects would be possible if the linear chain is modified such as to have branches close to the endpoints ( fig .",
    "[ fig02](b ) ) , or an end part stiffer than the rest of the chain ( as it could be realized in block copolymers ) . in both cases",
    "we expect that stretches out of the confining tube would be suppressed while chain retractions would not be much impeded .",
    "once the rates for elementary processes are given , the stationary properties of the system can be found from the solution of the master equation @xmath38 in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "here @xmath40 indicates the probability of finding the polymer in a configuration @xmath41 at time @xmath42 and the matrix @xmath43 contains the transition rates per unit of time between the different configurations of the chains , as given in the rules discussed above .",
    "dmrg was introduced in 1992 by s. white @xcite as an efficient algorithm to deal with a quantum hamiltonian for one dimensional systems .",
    "it is an iterative basis ",
    "truncation method , which allows to approximate eigenvalues and eigenstates , using an optimal basis of size @xmath44 .",
    "it is not restricted to quantum system ; it has also been successfully applied to a series of problems , ranging from two dimensional classical systems @xcite to stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "the basic common feature of these problems is the formal analogy with the schrdinger equation for a one dimensional many  body system .",
    "dmrg can also be applied to the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) for the reptating chain , albeit with some limitations due to the non  hermitian character of the matrix @xmath43 . in this specific case",
    "we start from small chains , for which @xmath43 can be diagonalized completely , and construct effective matrices representing @xmath43 for longer chains through truncation of the configurational space followed by an enlargement of the chain .",
    "this is done through the construction of a reduced density matrix whose eigenstates provide the optimal basis set , as can be shown rigorously ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the size @xmath44 of the basis remains fixed in this process . by enlarging @xmath44",
    "one checks the convergence of the procedure to the desired accuracy .",
    "hence @xmath44 is the main control parameter of the method . in the present case we found that @xmath45 is sufficient for small driving fields and we kept up to @xmath46 state for stronger fields .",
    "@xmath43 is only hermitian for zero driving field .",
    "so for a finite driving field one needs to apply the non ",
    "hermitian variant of the standard dmrg algorithm @xcite . for a non ",
    "hermitian matrix @xmath43 one has to distinguish between the right and left eigenvector belonging to the same eigenvalue .",
    "since @xmath43 is a stochastic matrix the lowest eigenvalue equals 0 and the corresponding left eigenvector is trivial ( see next section ) .",
    "the right eigenvector gives the stationary probability distribution .",
    "the next to lowest eigenvalue , the gap @xmath47 , yields the slowest relaxation time @xmath0 of the decay towards the stationary state .",
    "generally the dmrg method works best when the eigenvalues are well separated . for long chains and stronger driving fields",
    "the spectrum of @xmath43 gets an accumulation of eigenvalues near the zero eigenvalue of the stationary state .",
    "this hampers the convergence of the method seriously and enlarging the basis @xmath44 becomes of little help , while standardly this improves the accuracy substantially . in order to construct the reduced density matrix from the lowest eigenstates one needs to diagonalize the effective matrices @xmath43 at each dmrg step",
    ", we used the so - called arnoldi method which is known to be particularly stable for non - hermitian problems @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a series of dmrg results on the scaling behavior as function of the polymer length @xmath3 of the so - called tube renewal time @xmath48 , i.e. of the characteristic time for reptation , and of the diffusion coefficient @xmath49 .      the renewal time ,",
    "@xmath0 , is the typical time of the reptation process , i.e. the time necessary to loose memory of any initial configuration through reptation dynamics .",
    "@xmath0 is given by the inverse of the smallest gap of the matrix @xmath43 , which can be seen as follows : starting from an initial configuration one has , asymptotically for sufficiently long times ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are eigenstates of the matrix @xmath43 defined in eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) with eigenvalues @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath51 is the stationary state of the process , while the gap of @xmath43 corresponds to the inverse relaxation time .",
    "notice that , as the matrix @xmath43 is symmetric at zero field , @xmath55 is always a real number , while for non - hermitian matrices the eigenvalues may get an imaginary part , which causes a relaxation to equilibrium through damped oscillations",
    ".    an important point of which we took advantage in the calculation is the fact that the ground state @xmath56 of the matrix @xmath43 is known exactly in absence of any driving fields . since @xmath43 is stochastic and symmetric ( i.e. @xmath57 ) , it follows immediately that the stationary state is of the form @xmath58 , with @xmath59 a constant . instead of applying the dmrg technique directly to the matrix @xmath43 we applied it to the matrix @xmath60 defined by :",
    "@xmath61 now if we choose @xmath62 the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath60 is equal to @xmath55 , therefore the problem of calculating the gap of @xmath43 is reduced to the calculation of the ground state of a new ( non - stochastic ) matrix @xmath60 .",
    "this approach is considerably more advantageous in term of cpu time and memory required for the program ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] shows a plot of @xmath63 vs. @xmath64 for the renewal time as calculated from dmrg methods for various values of the stretching rate @xmath16 and for lengths up to @xmath2 .",
    "the data have been shifted along the abscissae axis by an arbitrary constant .",
    "we fitted the data by a linear interpolation , as it is mostly done in monte carlo simulations and in experiments .",
    "the resulting slopes provide estimates of the exponent @xmath65 , which we find to be sensitive to the stretching rate @xmath16 . for @xmath16",
    "sufficiently large ( @xmath66 ) we find @xmath67 , in agreement with experiments @xcite and previous monte carlo simulation results @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath65 decreases when @xmath16 is decreased . for @xmath16",
    "sufficiently small ( @xmath68 ) we find @xmath69 , which is a regime that has not yet been observed in experiments .",
    "0.2truecm    to shed some more light into these results we considered the _ effective exponent _ ,",
    "i.e. the following quantity : @xmath70 which is the discrete derivative of the data in the log - log scale plot .",
    "such quantity probes the local slope ( at a given length @xmath3 ) of the data of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] and provides a better estimate of the finite @xmath3 corrections to the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the calculation of @xmath71 requires very accurate data and can not be easily performed by monte carlo simulation results which are typically affected by numerical uncertainties , as these are amplified when taking numerical derivatives .",
    "we stress that already in the log - log plot of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] the deviation of the data from linearity is noticeable , therefore the values of @xmath65 given above are just average values and not to be expected as asymptotic ones .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] shows a plot of @xmath71 for the data given in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , plotted as function of @xmath72 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath73 , @xmath71 is seen to converge towards @xmath6 , in agreement with de gennes theory @xcite .",
    "corrections to this asymptotic limit yield @xmath74 when @xmath3 is sufficiently large , with deviations towards @xmath75 for small @xmath16 and not too large @xmath3 .",
    "0.2truecm    there exist some theoretical predictions for the form of the corrections to the asymptotic behavior of the renewal time @xcite .",
    "these are based on contour length fluctuations ( clf ) , i.e. on the idea that the length of the tube fluctuates in time and that this would help accelerating the renewal process .",
    "such fluctuations were not taken into account in the original work of de gennes , who assumed the tube to have a fixed length . according to clf theory ,",
    "thus , @xmath0 scales as @xcite @xmath76 with @xmath77 a typical length . substituting this equation into eq .",
    "( [ zn ] ) one obtains : @xmath78 which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath72 . for all lengths in the physical range @xmath79",

    "[ fig04 ] , where we have chosen @xmath81 in order to obtain the best fit of the dmrg data with @xmath82 .",
    "this value is consistent with that predicted by the clf theory @xcite .",
    "our results further suggest that the value of @xmath77 increases when @xmath16 is decreased .    while for sufficiently long chains the data apparently merge to the clf theory given by eq.([effdoi ] ) higher order corrections appear to be of opposite sign .",
    "when @xmath16 is lowered the latter become particularly strong so that the effective exponent for a certain range of lengths is even smaller than @xmath83 . to our knowledge such an effect has not yet been observed in experiments .",
    "presumably standard polymer mixtures will correspond to @xmath84 , which is a regime where an exponent @xmath85 is observed @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that mixtures with modified architecture , as those illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig02](b ) , i.e. long polymers with short branching ends , would correspond to curves at much lower @xmath16 . experimental results for such systems",
    "would be of high interest in order to check the predictions of the rd model in the low @xmath16 regime .    in order to gain some more insight in the precise form of @xmath86 we considered higher order terms which lead to an expression of the type : @xmath87\\ ] ] recently , milner and mcleish @xcite formulated a more complete theory beyond that of clf by doi , using ideas from the theory of stress relaxation for star polymers @xcite , which to lowest orders in @xmath88 yields an expression of the type given above .",
    "the effective exponent now reads : @xmath89 notice that the clf expression ( eq . [ effdoi ] ) diverges for @xmath90 , while the previous formula this divergence does not occur . for @xmath3",
    "not too large the numerator in eq .",

    "the dot - dashed line of fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] represents a fit for the @xmath92 case using eq.([effmm ] ) ; we find that the choice @xmath93 and @xmath94 fits very well the numerical data for @xmath95 , while deviations for shorter chains are clearly visible .",

    "this results has been also derived rigorously for the rd model where the coefficient of the leading term is also known @xcite : @xmath107    early experimental results on diffusion coefficients for polymer melts were consistent with a power @xmath108",
    "@xcite , while more recent results suggest that such exponent would be significantly higher @xcite .",
    "in fact the original measurements consistent with a scaling @xmath109 raised quite some problems in the past , which was pointing to an inconsistence between the scaling of @xmath1 and @xmath0 due to the following argument . for a reptating polymer , @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "the typical radius of gyration should scale as : @xmath110 now as the polymer obeys gaussian statistics @xmath111 , which implies that , if @xmath112 then necessarily @xmath113 , for the same range of lengths .",
    "this argument is however not quite correct in this form since @xmath111 only asymptotically , thus finite size corrections may affect @xmath1 and @xmath0 differently , as indeed happens in the rd model .",

    "[ fig06 ] we plotted the corresponding effective exponent , fitted to the @xmath82 results .",
    "again , the numerical results seem to approach the clf formula only for very long chains , where the effective exponent is already quite close to the asymptotic value .",

    "0.2truecm    finally we mention that the further order correction terms for the scaling of @xmath1 have raised recently some debate about the nature of the expansion @xcite .",
    "the dmrg results , which are accurate enough to investigate the higher orders , clearly show that these results can be very well represented by a series in @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "for finite values of @xmath130 severe limitations appear preventing us to extend the calculations to the long chains which we were able analyze in the limit @xmath131 .",

    "substantial information can be obtained by the analysis of the drift velocity for intermediate chain lengths as function of @xmath28 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] we have plotted the drift velocity as function of @xmath130 for chains up to @xmath134 and stretching ratio @xmath92 . the general behavior is a rise turning over into an exponential decay . for small @xmath28",

    "generally the curves are a compromise between two tendencies : the expression for the drift grows with the field but the probability on a configuration shifts towards configurations with the least velocity .",
    "with increasing @xmath130 initially the first effect dominates but gradually the second effect overrules the first .",

    "the deviations from the linear regime , where @xmath147 , are clearly observable as for sufficiently long chains and not too small fields the drift velocity approaches a non - vanishing value .",
    "a closer inspection on the curves reveals that the limiting constant velocity in the asymptotic regime @xmath73 is reached through a _",

    "band inversion was predicted first in the context of the biased reptation model ( brm ) @xcite , which provides a simplified picture of the physics of polymer reptation in a field , in which fluctuations effects are neglected .",
    "more refined analytical calculations in models where fluctuation effects are taken into account still predict the presence of a velocity minimum @xcite , thus the original result of the brm was confirmed .",
    "it should be pointed out that the eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) does not yield any minimum in the velocity as @xmath151 for all @xmath3 , thus it can not be strictly correct .",
    "although our results are limited to the onset of the minimum , we suspect that the minimum is not a very pronounced one so that for longer chains the curves @xmath97 vs. @xmath146 would appear rather flat .",

    "other previous simulations by duke @xcite of the rd model yielded instead a quite clear velocity minimum , but it is difficult to judge the quality of his data as no error bars are reported .",

    "unfortunately , present dmrg computations are limited to the onset of the inversion phenomenon .",
    "the problem with the dmrg approach is that it builds up an optimal basis for the stationary state using information of stationary states for shorter chains . around the band inversion point",
    "there is a kind of phase transition from short unoriented polymers to long oriented ones ( see for instance ref .",
    "this change implies that the optimal basis for short chains may be no longer a good one when longer chains are considered .",
    "we alleviated somewhat this problem using the dmrg algorithm at fixed @xmath156 , which allows indeed to study slightly longer chains , yet not enough to go deep into the band collapse regime , but sufficient to bring in evidence the velocity minimum .",
    "originally , it was thought that the drift velocity should be described by a scaling function in terms of the combination @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "it is nowadays believed that the correct scaling form for the velocity should be given by an expression @xcite @xmath158 with @xmath159 for @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath162 in order to match the known behavior of the velocity at large and small fields .",
    "the condition to have band inversion is @xmath163 for some @xmath3 at fixed fields , which is equivalent to the requirement @xmath164 , for a non - zero value of @xmath165 .",
    "notice that choosing the most general scaling form @xmath166 and from the requirement of @xmath163 one still obtains @xmath164 , with @xmath167 .",

    "0.4truecm      a more detailed insight in the shapes of the configurations is obtained by plotting averages of the local variables @xmath176 .",
    "the dmrg procedure leads naturally to the determination of the probabilities for two consecutive segments @xmath177 the probabilities on a single segment follow from these values @xmath178 which in turn are normalized @xmath179    the 9 possible values of @xmath180 are restricted by these conditions .",

    "the two relations ( [ a6 ] ) are an expression of the fact the average velocity of the reptons in the field direction and the curvilinear velocity are constant along the chain . taking the segment value @xmath184 one finds @xmath185 with @xmath97 the drift velocity . excluding the end segments from the summation yields the 2 equations ( @xmath186 ) @xmath187    one observes that the 3 probabilities on the end segments are fixed by the normalization and the 2 equations ( [ a8 ] ) . in general",
    "these relations show how delicate the development of the correlations is . in the fieldless case",

    "then of course the velocities vanish . considering the terms linear in the field ( or in @xmath188 )",
    "one sees that the drift velocity of the first repton , given by @xmath189 requires a delicate compensation in the linear deviations of the probabilities @xmath190 in order to give a value which vanishes as @xmath146 for long chains .    rather than giving the values of @xmath191 we plot the averages @xmath192 and @xmath193    0.4truecm    0.4truecm    a typical plot for the small @xmath130 regime is given in fig .",

    "we expect that for longer chains a large region in the middle develops where the shape varies weakly with @xmath130 and where the correlations between consecutive segments increase .",
    "thus the chain obtains longer stretches which are oriented in the field , either up or down , but which largely compensate , such that the overall shape in the middle remains more or less the same .",

    "this splitting up in `` bulk '' and `` surface '' behavior which keep each other in balance prevents a systematic expansion in the small parameter @xmath130 .",
    "using the dmrg technique we have determined the properties of the rd model for moderately long chains . at zero and for very small driving fields we could reach chains of the order of @xmath199 reptons ; for finite fields the lengths are restricted to some 30 reptons .",
    "this regime is far outside the domain where exact diagonalization of the reptation matrix is possible .",
    "the dmrg results have the advantage , over corresponding monte carlo results , of being virtually exact as long as the iteration method converges .",
    "since the dmrg procedure gives simultaneously all the lengths @xmath3 smaller than the maximum , we can accurately determine the finite size effects on the asymptotic large @xmath3 behavior .",
    "we find that the renewal time @xmath0 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 are strongly affected by finite size corrections in the regime of these moderately large @xmath3 . here",
    "we have shown that the large finite size corrections , characteristic for the reptation process , manifest themselves as effective exponents for the asymptotic behavior of the renewal time and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we found that dmrg results reveal that , while the leading correction terms , as given by doi s theory @xcite fit rather well the data for large @xmath3 , they are not sufficient to cause a crossover behavior and higher order corrections need to be included .",
