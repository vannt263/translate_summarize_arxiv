    "when singlet fermions are not present in a given theory , dirac leptogenesis  @xcite , or dirac neutrinogenesis , represents a very interesting alternative to the traditional leptogenesis scenario , which relies on the existence of heavy majorana neutrinos . in dirac leptogenesis , neutrinos are purely dirac particles whose small but nonzero masses appear as ratios of dimensionful parameters in an effective field theory .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that , in the context of split supersymmetry  @xcite , dirac leptogenesis is a phenomenologically viable scenario capable of satisfying all relevant constraints from cosmology and neutrino physics as well as reproducing the observed baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath2 of the universe .",
    "split supersymmetry is advantageous primarily for two reasons .",
    "the first of these is that very heavy gravitinos can easily evade the constraints that big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) places on the post - inflationary reheating temperature ; the second is that in dirac leptogenesis the superpotential is extended by the addition of new terms carrying phases and nontrivial flavor structure .",
    "dangerous contributions from these terms to flavor - changing processes are automatically safe in split supersymmetry , but must be treated with care when the scale of all the superpartners is near the electroweak scale . in the latter case",
    "( assuming that the constraints for gravitino cosmology are satisfied ) it is necessary to compute carefully the rates for flavor - violating processes in the lepton sector .",
    "the aim of this paper is to ascertain whether or not dirac leptogenesis is permitted by flavor violation constraints in supersymmetric theories with low - scale slepton masses .",
    "we will begin our inquiry by briefly reviewing the theoretical framework of dirac leptogenesis and deriving the additional contributions to the slepton mass matrices to which its superpotential gives rise .",
    "we then turn to the calculation of rates for the processes @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we apply the combined constraints from flavor violation and baryogenesis and assess the viability and predictability of dirac leptogenesis when superpartner masses are at or around the weak scale .",
    "in dirac leptogenesis , as in the traditional leptogenesis picture  @xcite , the conditions for successful baryogenesis  @xcite are met by positing the existence of a heavy particle with cp - violating decays into leptons . the lepton number produced in these decays",
    "is then processed into a baryon number for the universe by electroweak sphaleron processes  @xcite . in the supersymmetric version of dirac leptogenesis ,",
    "all of this is engineered via a specific set of modifications to the superpotential and the postulation of a few additional superfields .",
    "in addition to the matter fields of the mssm , at least two massive vector - like pairs of chiral superfields @xmath4 and @xmath5 are required , as are three generations of right - handed neutrino superfield @xmath6 and an additional exotic superfield @xmath7 , whose function will be to acquire a scalar vev . an additional symmetry , whose breaking will be responsible for late neutrino masses , is also imposed , and charges under it assigned so that the most general leptonic - sector superpotential is @xmath8 here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ( generally complex ) coupling matrices and @xmath11 are the masses of the heavy vector - like pairs , which , in order for successful baryogenesis to occur , are generically required to be @xmath12  gev or larger . , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are all complex matrices , but we can always choose to work in a basis where @xmath13 is diagonal . ]",
    "once the heavy superfields @xmath14 and @xmath15 are integrated out , the resulting effective superpotential @xmath16 will yield a small but nonzero dirac mass term for the neutrinos , provided that some mechanism is invoked to give the scalar component of @xmath7 a vev .",
    "since @xmath9 and @xmath10 are complex , the decays of both the scalar and fermionic components of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the lightest of the additional heavy superfields , will in general be cp - violating and @xmath10 . ] and will result in two equal and opposite stores of lepton number , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the first of these is an aggregate lepton number stored in left - handed leptons , sleptons , and other fields in equilibrium with them , and is transformed into baryon number by sphaleron interactions .",
    "the second is stored only in right - handed neutrinos , has a large f - term vev ) to equilibrate with them and thus contribute to @xmath21 .",
    "otherwise they would contribute to @xmath22 . ]",
    "which , being singlets under @xmath23 , do not experience sphaleron effects and only couple to the other light matter fields through the effective neutrino yukawa interaction given by  ( [ eq : effdiraclepsuperpotential ] ) with @xmath24 .",
    "this interaction is suppressed by @xmath25 and therefore the time scale for the equilibration of left - handed and right - handed stores of lepton number can be quite late . if the effective neutrino yukawas are sufficiently small , the equilibration time scale will be much longer than the time scale at which sphaleron processes effectively shut off  @xcite . when this is the case , a net baryon number for the universe will already have frozen in and",
    "will persist unaltered until present time .",
    "in addition to providing a mechanism for baryogenesis , dirac leptogenesis holds some interesting implications for neutrino physics . here",
    ", the squared neutrino masses are given by @xmath26 in order to reproduce the observed mass splittings  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and the angles in the @xmath29 matrix , it is necessary to impose a few conditions on the coupling matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which determine the matrix structure in  ( [ eq : neutmassspelledout ] ) .",
    "there are several ways of doing this , but we will focus on one particular , theoretically - motivated scenario called constrained hierarchical dirac leptogenesis ( chdl )  @xcite , which produces a normal hierarchy among neutrino masses .    in chdl ,",
    "the appropriate matrix structure for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the ( diagonal ) mass matrix @xmath13 is obtained by requiring that @xmath9 and @xmath10 both be antisymmetric with @xmath30 entries and by relating @xmath13 to the fermion yukawas through a flavor symmetry .",
    "this structure ensures that the neutrino mass matrix one obtains after integrating out the heavy fields @xmath14 and @xmath31 corresponds to a normal neutrino hierarchy , provided that there is a hierarchy among the mass eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "of course this coupling structure also impacts baryogenesis , but it has been shown that in chdl , the constraints from baryogenesis and neutrino physics can be satisfied simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "baryogenesis and a small neutrino dirac mass are not the only consequences of equation  ( [ eq : diraclepsuperpotential ] ) , however . assuming that at some high scale @xmath34 all the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are flavor diagonal and universal , the new terms of equation  ( [ eq : diraclepsuperpotential ] ) will induce potentially off - diagonal contributions to the slepton mass matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . as in majorana leptogenesis",
    "some of these contributions come from running the scalar soft masses from some high scale @xmath34 ( the planck scale , the gut scale , etc . ) down to @xmath32 . assuming the universality condition at the high scale and that all soft a - terms are equal to the relevant yukawa coupling multiplied by the universal soft supersymmetric mass @xmath38",

    "@xmath55 , to give the correct leptonic mixing matrix @xmath56 , the remaining free parameters of the model are @xmath57 , @xmath11 , and @xmath55 .",

    "the most stringent constraints on flavor violation in the lepton sector come from measurements of the branching ratios for flavor - violating decays and conversions of heavy leptons , such as @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the current experimental limits on the 2-body decay processes are  @xcite @xmath69 in the near future , the meg experiment  @xcite is expected to improve the current experimental bound on @xmath0 by several orders of magnitude , to @xmath70 or lower .",
    "other related projects , such as prime  @xcite ( sensitive to @xmath71 conversion ) , are expected to go online over the next few years .",

    "they involve both a sneutrino ( and chargino ) mass eigenstate and charged slepton ( and neutralino ) mass eigenstate running in the loop .",
    "these amplitudes have been computed in  @xcite for a general mssm scenario but for completeness we include them in appendix a.    in order to proceed further , it will be necessary to make a few assumptions concerning the supersymmetric model parameters . those relevant to a discussion of lepton - sector flavor violation include the gaugino masses @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the higgs mass parameter @xmath86 , the ratio of higgs vevs @xmath87 , and the soft masses for the sleptons . in our analysis , we choose the values @xmath88  gev , @xmath89  gev , @xmath90  gev , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 . as for the slepton soft masses we will , as previously mentioned , assume a common scale @xmath93 and examine what effect varying @xmath93 has on @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we will assume that the scale at which soft masses are universal is @xmath96  gev , though the results are not particularly sensitive to this choice .    .",
    "the left - hand panel shows exclusion contours in @xmath32-@xmath57 space for a universal scalar soft mass @xmath97  gev , with @xmath98 ; the right hand panel shows the variation of the branching ratio @xmath94 with respect to @xmath93 using @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in both plots ,",
    "we have taken @xmath88  gev , @xmath89  gev , and @xmath90  gev .",
    "we have also assigned the @xmath7 superfield an f - term vev @xmath99 gev .",
    "such a large vev results in large trilinear couplings between higgs fields and sneutrinos and therefore induces potentially sizeable mixings between left - handed and right - handed sneutrinos after electroweak symmetry breaking . in each plot , the thick solid contours represent the current experimental bound on the branching fraction  ( [ eq : currentexpconstraints ] ) ; the dashed lines represent the expected future experimental bound of @xmath100 from meg .",
    "the thin solid contour in the left - hand panel delimits the region allowed by leptogenesis constraints.[fig : exclusionplot],width=275,height=396 ]    the results of our calculation are displayed in figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] . in the left panel ,",
    "we show exclusion contours in @xmath32-@xmath57 space for @xmath97  gev .",
    "the areas below and to the right of the lower contour ( the white region ) are excluded by the experimental bounds given in  ( [ eq : currentexpconstraints ] ) .",
    "we also include contours demarcating the region wherein baryogenesis can succeed , which have been updated from  @xcite to include the effects of processes second order in @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see appendix  [ app : secondorderphi ] ) .",
    "contours have also been computed for @xmath101 , but the constraints they imply for the theory are far weaker than those from @xmath0 . in the right panel , we show how varying the universal scalar mass affects the branching ratio for @xmath0 , which reaches a maximum when @xmath93 is around the weak scale .",
    "this is to be expected : when @xmath93 is much larger than the weak scale both the slepton mass - squared eigenvalues and the flavor - violating terms scale like @xmath102 and the sneutrino and charged slepton mixing matrices asymptote to a constant value , while the branching ratio is still suppressed by the masses running in the loop ; as @xmath93 decreases below the weak scale , @xmath40 and @xmath40 go to zero and the slepton masses are dominated by flavor diagonal electroweak contributions .",
    "we also observe that , as in the susy see - saw case  @xcite , the flavor violation rate is quite sensitive to @xmath87 .    in interpreting the results in figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] , it is useful to note that in the regions of the plot near the exclusion contours ( where the branching ratio for @xmath0 is quite low ) , flavor - violating effects will be small .",
    "it is therefore valid to use the mass - insertion approximation there and treat @xmath103 ( left ) , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 as small corrections to the slepton propagators .",
    "since the sneutrino propagator can receive mass insertions from all three , we will focus our analysis on the partial amplitude from the sneutrino - mediated process ( the left diagram in figure  [ fig : feynmixingsfull ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : feynmixingsmassinsert ] , we list the leading contributions to this partial amplitude involving each of @xmath106 ( left diagram ) , @xmath104 , and @xmath107 . since there is no coupling between leptons and right - handed sneutrinos",
    ", corrections from @xmath104 and @xmath105 only appear at second and third order in the mass insertion expansion , respectively .",
    "therefore , if there is no substantial hierarchy among these three sets of mixing terms , the primary source of flavor - violation comes from mixings between left - handed sleptons . in the mass insertion approximation",
    ", the branching ratio for such processes can naively be estimated as @xmath108 and therefore contours of branching ratio in the @xmath109 plane correspond to contours of @xmath40 . according to equation  ( [ eq : deltamassprops ] ) , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is a dimensionless proportionality constant with dimension @xmath65 ^ 2 $ ] , so the exclusion contour associated with left - left mixing takes the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "the oblique , upper exclusion contour in figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] , which embodies the constraint from left - left mixing , is associated with this linear equation .",
    "( left diagram ) , and for the leading process involving @xmath114 ( right diagram ) , with sneutrinos running in the loop in the mass - insertion approximation .",
    "note that any process involving @xmath115 necessarily involves two mass insertions , and any one involving @xmath105 ( given by the diagram on the right with an additional @xmath105 insertion ) necessarily involves three .",
    "[ fig : feynmixingsmassinsert],width=529 ]    while some hierarchy among the mass insertion terms is necessary for @xmath104 and @xmath105 to be relevant , there is no a priori reason why such a hierarchy should not exist .",
    "the @xmath104 contribution  ( [ eq : mlr ] ) is proportional to @xmath42 , which is essentially a free parameter . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath42 is not even relevant to dirac leptogenesis per se , but appears as a common side - effect of mechanisms for assigning the @xmath7 superfield a scalar vev .",
    "still , in many such mechanisms  @xcite , the scale @xmath116 can potentially be quite large ( @xmath117 or higher ) , and if this is the case , contribution from @xmath115 could potentially be as important as those from @xmath103 .",
    "let us assume for a moment that this is the case and examine the constraints related to @xmath104 and @xmath104 together .",
    "in regions of figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] where @xmath57 is small , we now have @xmath118 along any exclusion contour .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : deltamassprops ] ) tells us that , @xmath119 where @xmath120 has mass dimension @xmath65^{3}$ ] .",
    "therefore , when @xmath121 , the associated contour is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "this equation explains the behavior of the contour in the left panel of figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] when @xmath57 is small and the oblique bound from left - left mixing abruptly ells into a horizontal line  the bound from left - right mixing . in general , the effect of increasing @xmath42 is to push this latter bound upward , and for @xmath124 , the entirety of parameter space is excluded .",
    "the effect of right - right mixing is higher order still and only becomes relevant in regions of parameter space where @xmath32 is large and @xmath57 is small  regions already excluded by left - left mixing .    for the numerical analysis shown in figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] ,",
    "we have taken @xmath125 gev which in some parts of the @xmath126 plane , induces substantial mixing between left - handed and right - handed sneutrinos .",
    "sizeable mixing of this sort opens the intriguing possibility that the lightest sneutrino could be a legitimate dark matter candidate  @xcite in dirac leptogenesis , a possibility which would be interesting to investigate in the future .",
    "the primary message of figure  [ fig : exclusionplot ] is that the combined constraints from leptogenesis and flavor violation do not exclude dirac leptogenesis in theories with low - scale sfermion masses . in general , the latter set of constraints tend to rule out theories with exceptionally high masses for the decaying particles @xmath17 and @xmath18 and exceptionally low values for @xmath57 . , @xmath127 and @xmath55 enter in the effective neutrino yukawa coupling given by [ eq : effdiraclepsuperpotential ] , so when one of them is increased , we have to appropriately tune the other two to maintain the neutrino yukawas at a fixed value .",
    "such an adjustment , in turn , changes the different contributions from these parameters to off - diagonal entries in the slepton mass matrices . ]",
    "given current bounds on lepton flavor violation , there is still a sizeable region of parameter space within which the scenario succeeds , even when @xmath93 is as low as @xmath128  gev .",
    "it is of interest , however , that meg and the next generation of lepton flavor violation experiments will be able to probe the vast majority of this region , and the data from these experiments will be crucial in determining the viability of dirac leptogenesis with weak - scale superpartners . as was mentioned in section  [ sec : diraclep ] , some new symmetry must be posited in order to obtain late neutrino mass generation . in dirac leptogenesis ,",
    "neutrino masses are the result of the scalar component of the @xmath7 superfield acquiring a vev which breaks this new symmetry , producing a goldstone boson or pseudo - goldstone boson , depending on the nature of the symmetry .",
    "constraints on such bosons arise from both bbn and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) considerations  @xcite as well as from the detection of abnormalities in the neutrino flux associated with supernova events  @xcite , and they can become problematic ( depending on the mass of the goldstone boson ) when the symmetry - breaking vev is less than around 1  gev .",
    "the value of @xmath57 required by leptogenesis constraints is around 10  gev , and thus the cosmological complications associated with breaking the additional symmetry necessary for dirac leptogenesis do not pose any problem for the theory .",
    "it has already been shown  @xcite that dirac leptogenesis stands as a phenomenologically viable alternative to the standard leptogenesis picture . in theories with comparatively light scalars , however , flavor violation becomes a serious concern commonly solved by the universality assumption .",
    "the dirac leptogenesis superpotential  ( [ eq : diraclepsuperpotential ] ) gives rise to new mass terms for sneutrinos and charged sleptons which induce mixings between flavor eigenstates after the breaking of both the electroweak symmetry and the new symmetry responsible for late neutrino mass generation .",
    "experimental limits on flavor violation in heavy lepton decays such as @xmath0 significantly constrain any theory which permits slepton flavor mixing , and in dirac leptogenesis these constraints translate into bounds on the theory parameters @xmath32 ( the mass of the heavy decaying particle ) and @xmath57 ( the vev of the exotic scalar field ) .",
    "baryogenesis requirements also place significant constraints on both of these parameters , and thus the question as to whether leptogenesis can be made to work at all when scalar masses are light is a highly nontrivial one .    in this work , we have shown that even when the masses of supersymmetric scalars are small , substantial regions of parameter space exist for which dirac leptogenesis succeeds in producing a realistic baryon asymmetry for the universe while respecting current bounds on flavor violation .",
    "this is true even when the masses of supersymmetric particles are as low as @xmath1  gev .",
    "interestingly enough , for such light fields , which presumably can be discovered at the lhc , it is generically predicted that experiments such as meg should have enough sensitivity to observe flavor changing effects if dirac leptogenesis is in fact responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
