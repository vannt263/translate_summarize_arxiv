    "@xcite , _ asca _ @xcite and _ bepposax _ @xcite satellites were performed in the nineties , characterizing the spectrum of the pulsed emission and the morphology of the remnant as possibly due to the presence of several components , interacting via collimated outflows from the pulsar .",

    "( _ egret _ ) , the instrument operating at the energies from 30  mev to 30  gev .",
    "this was remarkable , since all other known gamma - ray pulsars show spectral turnovers well above 100  mev @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the break in the spectrum could be interpreted as due to inhibition of the pair - production caused by the photon - splitting phenomenon @xcite .",

    "gamma - ray photons for this pulsar were collected and analyzed starting in july 2007 , up to late october 2009 when started observing in spinning mode due to reaction wheel failure .",
    "the large  effective area and long observing time ( @xmath23 days on target ) provide a total exposure of @xmath24  @xmath21  s ( @xmath25 mev ) during this @xmath26  yr period which gives our observations a good photon harvest from this pulsar .",

    "the pulsed flux was computed considering all the counts above the minimum of the lightcurve ( see @xcite ) we did not detect pulsed emission at a significance @xmath43 for @xmath44  mev and thus we can only give an upper limit at 1@xmath1 of @xmath45 pulsed counts . this is consistent with the fact that @xcite report only a @xmath46 detection at @xmath47  gev with the _ fermi _ data .",

    "the errors considered are statistical , as the systematic errors do not affect the measurements of the pulsed counts .",
    "the first peak is coincident in phase with the x - ray single broad peak and with  peak ( see @xcite and references therein )",

    "based on our exposure , calculated by the _ grid _ scientific analysis task ag_exmapgen , we derived the gamma - ray flux from the number of pulsed counts .",
    "this method , though typically giving higher statistical errors than the likelihood analysis , is more accurate and sensitive to evaluate the flux of this pulsar , given its soft spectrum ( and the correspondingly large psf ) and the contribution from other nearby and brighter sources and possibly from the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , that all affect the spatial analysis . using this method ,",
    "the problem of modeling the background is dealt with by discarding the counts below the pulsed threshold , so that the observed pulsed counts belong to the pulsar .",
    "all the other sources of systematical errors , such as the effective area and s psf , as well as the diffuse emission , contribute to @xmath55% , so that they are much lower than the statistical errors and they are not quoted in the flux measurements .",
    "we divided  bandwidth into three energy intervals : 30100  mev , 100500  mev and above 500  mev .",
    "the pulsed fluxes thus obtained were @xmath56  ph  @xmath57  s@xmath12 in the 30100  mev band , @xmath58  ph  @xmath57  s@xmath12 in the 100500  mev band and a @xmath59 upper limit @xmath60  ph  @xmath57  s@xmath12 for @xmath61  mev .",

    "pulsed flux confirms the presence of a soft spectral break . as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec ] , we modeled the observed  and  fluxes with a power - law plus cutoff fit using the minuit minimization package @xcite : @xmath64 $ ] , with three free parameters : the normalization @xmath65 , the spectral index @xmath66 , the cutoff energy @xmath67 and allowing @xmath68 to assume values of 1 and 2 ( indicating either an exponential or a superexponential cutoff ) .",
    "no acceptable @xmath30 values were obtained for a superexponential cutoff , the presence of which can be excluded at a @xmath69 confidence level , while for an exponential cutoff we found @xmath70 for @xmath71 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a null hypothesis probability of 0.05 .",
    "the best values thus obtained for the parameters of the fit were : @xmath72  s@xmath12  @xmath57 , @xmath73 , @xmath74  mev .",
    "we performed an analysis of the ratio between the two peak heights .",
    "the second peak appears in the   band 1030 mev and is observed with  up to @xmath75  mev : it is harder than the first peak in the  energy band , and it is present at all energies in the  energy band , so that it might possibly be harder even at s energies but the low statistics at high energies do not allow us to discriminate .    as a consistency check for the pulsed fluxes reported above",
    ", a maximum likelihood analysis in a region of 10 degrees around the source position was performed to assess possible unpulsed contribution from the pwn , although no detection was reported in the first catalog of high - confidence gamma - ray sources detected by the  satellite @xcite . the likelihood analysis ( see @xcite and for agile in particular , details will be provided in chen et al . in preparation ) took into account the numerous sources present in this crowded region ( including the extremely bright nearby gamma - ray pulsar j1509 - 5850 , @xcite ) . the upper limit found in the   energy range by likelihood analysis ( @xmath76  ph  @xmath57  s@xmath12 above 100  mev ) is above the corresponding pulsed flux above 100  mev ( @xmath77  ph  @xmath57  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that the timing analisys is expected to have for this target a better sensitivity ( with respect to the likelihood analysis ) .",
    "it is worth noting that  is also not detected by likelihood analysis by _ fermi _ @xcite apart from the @xmath78  gev energy band where the emission could be related to the pwn seen by _",

    "pulsar magnetosphere models are usually divided into two categories , depending on the sites for the high - energy emission . in _ polar cap _",
    "models @xcite the emission comes from the regions near the neutron star surface , while _ outer gap _",
    "models @xcite predict that the emission be originated in the regions close to the light cylinder .",
    "alternative models predict an emission zone encompassing the whole magnetosphere , which departs from the external rim of the polar cap region : these are the _ slot gap _ models @xcite ; others predict emission from alternative regions in the outer magnetosphere , the _ annular gap _ ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "different models predict different spectral and geometrical properties .",
    "the bulk of the spin - powered pulsar flux is usually emitted in the mev - gev energy band with spectral breaks at @xmath79  gev ( see @xcite or e.g. @xcite ) .  has the softest spectrum observed among gamma - ray pulsars , with a sub - gev cutoff at @xmath80  gev .",
    "the second softest spectrum and lowest energy cutoff ( 0.7(5 )  gev ) is that of psr  b0656 + 14 , recently observed by _",
    "the observed lightcurve of  shows two peaks lagging the radio peak by , respectively , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in the following",
    "we discuss how the new  observations can constrain the models for emission from the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "when  was detected in soft gamma - rays but not significantly at @xmath31  mev , it was proposed that the mechanism responsible for this low - energy spectral break might be photon splitting @xcite .",
    "the photon splitting @xcite is an exotic third - order quantum electro - dynamics ( qed ) process expected when the magnetic field approaches or exceeds the @xmath81 value defined as @xmath82  g , above which quantum effects become relevant .",
    "most current theories for the generation of coherent radio emission in pulsar magnetospheres require formation of an electron - positron pair plasma developing via electromagnetic cascades . in very high magnetic fields",
    "the formation of pair cascades can be altered by the process of photon splitting : @xmath83 , which will operate as an attenuation mechanism in the high - field regions near pulsar polar caps .",
    "since it has no energy threshold , photon splitting can attenuate photons below the threshold for pair production , thus determining a spectral cutoff at lower energies",
    ". this process can not operate in the low fields of outer gap models because it only has appreciable reaction rates when the magnetic field is at least a significant fraction of the quantum critical field @xmath84 ( the attenuation coefficient @xmath85 scaling as @xmath86 ) , and magnetic fields strong enough are not present in the outer magnetosphere as @xmath87 .    in the case of  a polar cap model with photon splitting would be able to explain the soft gamma - ray emission and the low energy spectral cutoff , now quantified by  observations .",
    "since the mechanism of photon splitting is , as stated , strongly dependent on the magnetic field strength , if the field strength at the emitting region is @xmath88 ( i.e. at heights below 1.3 neutron star radii , @xmath89 ) , the photon splitting is the dominant means of attenuation that inhibits efficient pair cascade production @xcite and then gamma - ray emission .",
    "based on the observed cutoffs , which are related to the photons saturation escape energy , we can derive constraints on the magnetic field strength at emission , in the framework of photon splitting :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the photon saturation escape energy and @xmath92 is the angle between the photon momentum and the magnetic field vectors at the surface and is here assumed to be very small : @xmath93 ( see @xcite ) . using the observed energy cutoff ( @xmath94  mev ) we find that @xmath88 , which implies an emission altitude @xmath95 , which is the height where possibly also pair production could ensue .",
    "this altitude of emission agrees with the polar cap models ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a smaller energy cutoff , as in @xcite ,",
    "would have implied even lower emission altitude and a sharper break , possibly caused by the total absence of pair production .",
    "it is apparent that small differences in the emission position will cause strong differences in spectral shape .",
    "this is possibly the reason for the different emission properties of the two peaks as observed in the total (  plus ) gamma - ray energy band .",
    "also , a trend can be observed , from lower to higher energies ( see the x - ray lightcurve for the trend in the first peak , as in fig .",
    "3 of @xcite ) , of the peaks slightly drifting away from the radio peak .",
    "this we assume to be another signature of the fact that small variations in emission height can be responsible for sensible changes in the lightcurves in such a high magnetic field .",
    "the scenario proposed by @xcite is strengthened by its prediction that psr  b0656 + 14 should have a cutoff with an intermediate value between  and the other gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "the main reason for the parallel between the two pulsars was at the time the fact that they had , respectively , the highest and second highest inferred magnetic fields . at present , however , there are a handful of gamma - ray pulsars with higher magnetic field than psr  b0656 + 14 in the _ fermi _ first year pulsar catalog @xcite which do not show a low energy cutoff .",
    "nonetheless ,  ( see @xcite ) and psr  b0656 + 14 @xcite both show evidence of being aligned rotators , which could imply polar cap emission , as is also hinted by .",
    "a soft cutoff ( below 1  gev ) is in principle possible for polar cap scenarios even without invoking photon splitting attenuation . in polar",
    "cap models the strong magnetic field permits one - photon pair creation that attenuates super - gev photons in crab - like ( e.g. , based on the parameter @xmath96 ) and vela - like pulsars ( e.g. psr  b0656 + 14 ) , whereas pair creation in outer gap models is mediated through the two - photon process involving surface thermal x - rays as targets . according to the calculations of @xcite , emission from the regions close to the polar caps is possible when @xmath97 , where @xmath66 is the angle between the rotation and the magnetic axis and @xmath98 is the half - angle of the gamma - beam emerging from the polar cap .",
    "furthermore , with emission from the polar caps , or some ( @xmath99 ) polar cap radii , the pulse profile at high energies can have either one ( as in the case of psr  b0656 + 14 ) or two peaks , with a peak - to - peak phase separation as large as 0.40.5 ( albeit slightly smaller than what is observed for  at the highest energies ) .    the polar cap model as an emission mechanism",
    "is nowadays debated .",
    "on one hand theoretical objections arise from the fact that the angular momentum is not conserved in polar cap emission ( see @xcite , @xcite , treves et al . in preparation ) . at the same time , mounting evidence of a preferential explanation of the observed gamma - ray lightcurves with high altitude cascades is also coming from the recent results by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of",
    ", the derived gamma - ray luminosity from the flux at @xmath100  mev , considering a 1  sr beam sweep is @xmath101  erg / s , where @xmath102 indicates the distance in units of 5.2 kpc .",
    "while traditionally the beaming fraction ( @xmath103 ) was considered to be the equivalent of a 1  sr sweep , nowadays ( see e.g. @xcite ) the tendency is to consider a larger beaming fraction ( @xmath104 ) , close to a @xmath105  sr beam . using @xmath106 in our calculations",
    ", we would have obtained @xmath107  .",
    "thus the maximum conversion efficiency of the rotational energy loss ( @xmath108  , see @xmath53  1 ) into gamma - ray luminosity is 0.3 .",
    "our result is not easily comparable with the typical gamma - ray luminosities above 100  mev , because for  this energy band is beyond the spectral break . using  data alone",
    "we obtained a luminosity above 30  mev @xmath109  erg / s , again for a 1  sr beam .",
    "if the gamma - ray luminosity can not account for a large fraction of the rotational energy loss , then the angular momentum conservation objection from @xcite becomes less cogent for this pulsar , exactly as it happens for the radio emission . for psr  b0656 + 14",
    "no outer magnetosphere emission model seemed to satisfy the observed features and a lower magnetosphere model , with an aligned geometry between the rotational and magnetic axes , has been proposed and seems plausible from polarization studies .",
    "its efficiency in the conversion of the rotational energy loss into gamma - ray luminosity is one of the lowest observed for the gamma - ray pulsars ( see @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath110 , not violating the constraints imposed by the conservation of angular momentum .    alternatively ,",
    "if such an efficiency as that of  were incompatible with this conservation law , an interpretation of  emission should be sought in the frame of the three dimensional outer magnetosphere gap model , as was done by @xcite . according to their model , hard x - rays and low energy gamma - rays",
    "have the same origin : they are produced by synchrotron self - compton radiation of secondary electron - positron pairs of the outer gap .",
    "therefore , as observed , the phase offset of hard x - rays and low energy gamma - rays with respect to the radio pulse is the same , with the possibility of a small lag due to the thickness of the emission region . according to @xcite estimates , a magnetic inclination angle @xmath111 and a viewing angle @xmath112",
    "are required to reproduce the observed lightcurve .",
    "similarly , for psr  b0656 + 14 , @xcite argue that large @xmath66 and @xmath113 angles are required to reproduce the observed lightcurve in the framework of outer gap models .",
    "finally , using the simulations of @xcite , who produced a map of pulse profiles for different combinations of angles @xmath66 and @xmath113 in the different emission models , the observed lightcurve from  is best reproduced if @xmath114 and @xmath115 , in the framework of the two pole caustic model @xcite .",
    "since the parameters used for the application of the outer gap model to were based on its former observations by ,  spectrum does not precisely fit the spectrum predicted by the model of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath66 and @xmath113 required by this model are not in good agreement with the corresponding values obtained with radio measurements . in fact , @xcite observe that @xmath66 must be @xmath116 at the @xmath117 confidence level .",
    "the prediction obtained by the simulations of @xcite for slot gap emission is in better agreement with the radio polarization observations than what predicted in the outer gap framework .",
    "in fact , in the framework of the rotating vector model ( rvm , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , @xcite also propose that , if the restriction is imposed that @xmath118 @xcite then @xmath119 at the @xmath117 level . for these values",
    ", however , the melatos model for the spin down of an oblique rotator predicts a braking index @xmath120 , slightly inconsistent with the observed value ( @xmath121 , see  1 ) .",
    "also in the case of psr  b0656 + 14 , @xcite conclude that the large values of @xmath66 and @xmath113 are somewhat at odds with the constraints from the modeling of the radio data and the thermal x - rays which seem to imply a more aligned geometry .",
    "improved radio polarization measurements would help placing better constraints on the pulsar geometry and therefore on the possibility of a gap in the extended or outer magnetosphere , but the quality of the polarization measurements from @xcite is already excellent , the problem being that , like most pulsars , only shows emission over a limited pule phase range and therefore the rvm models are highly degenerate . at present",
    "the geometry privileged by the state of the art measurements is best compatible with polar cap models .",
    "higher statistics in the number of observed gamma - ray pulsars could help characterize a class of `` outliers '' having gamma - ray emission from the polar caps , which potentially constitute a privileged target for .",

    "<S> our spectrum constrains the magnetic altitude of the emission point(s ) at 3  km above the neutron star surface , implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggested because pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of the magnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photon splitting . in the case of an outer - gap scenario , or the two pole caustic model , better constraints on the geometry of the emission </S>",
    "<S> would be needed from the radio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the models to reproduce  lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements . </S>"
