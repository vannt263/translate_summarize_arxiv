    "the concept of a point rotation framearises in crystallooptics . distinctive feature of the frame , in contrast to cartesian one , is existence of the rotation axis at every point .",
    "in such a frame the axes are constructed on field amplitudes and only the axis direction is essential .",
    "similar ( non - rotating ) frames have been used in quantum field theory for a long time .",
    "an example of the frame is the rotating optical indicatrix ( index ellipsoid ) .",
    "one more difference in comparison with the cartesian frame is the absence of centrifugal forces in the point rotation frame .",
    "the frame coordinates is an angle ( phase ) and time , the frequency of rotation is a parameter . in electro - optical crystals",
    "the rotation is stimulated by an applied rotating electric field . in crystals with the linear ( pockels )",
    "effect the frequency equals half ( and even quarter @xcite ) of that of the electric field . in the kerr crystals this frequency",
    "is doubled @xcite . the sense of rotation of the plane circularly polarized light wave moving through the electro - optical crystal with rotating optical indicatrix is reversed and the optical frequency is shifted if the amplitude of the applied electric field equals the half - wave value .",
    "the device for the shift by means of electro - optical crystals is the single - sideband modulator @xcite .",
    "note that optically the rotating phase plate is equivalent to the modulator but physically they are different as the plate has only one axis of rotation .",
    "it is convenient to use for the description of circularly polarized plane light wave in the single - sideband modulator the transition to a frame with the resting optical indicatrix .",
    "apparently , for the first time , convenience of that had been described in initial works on single - sideband modulation of light @xcite .",
    "such a transition results in change of the optical frequency .",
    "the change equals the frequency of the optical indicatrix . after the polarization reversal and returning back to the initial frame",
    "the frequency deviation is doubled .",
    "emphasize that in the frame with the resting indicatrix the modulating electric field is also at rest in spite the fact that both the indicatrix and field rotate at different frequencies relative to the initial frame ? !",
    "this is one further unusual and strange property of the point rotation frames .",
    "the transition to the rotating frame always is connected with the question what is the frequency superposition law , is it linear or not .",
    "the nonlinear law always corresponds to an extra frequency shift . emphasize that the consideration in the framework of the maxwell equation can not give such an extra shift",
    "the situation is analogous to a comparison between results obtained for rectilinear move with help of the lorentz transformation and the newton mechanics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the question was considered in assumption that the combined frequency may be presented in terms of power series of two other frequencies .",
    "it was also assumed that the frequency of one frame relative to another equals  to the reverse frequency .",
    "the only difference is the sign .",
    "the negative sign corresponds to the rotation in opposite direction . in this condition",
    "the extra shift in the first approximation is proportional to the product of the optical frequency squared and the modulation frequency .",
    "the characteristic constant in the extra shift has dimension of time . in ref .",
    "@xcite a optical experiment was also proposed for measurement of the term and it was shown that a lower limit for measurements of the characteristic constant with such a form of the shift is about @xmath1sec .    shortly after it was shown that an analogy exists between the light propagation in medium with the rotating optical indicatrix and the motion particle in the rotating magnetic field and both the phenomena can be described in the framework of the pauli equation @xcite . in other words",
    "a plane circularly polarized light wave propagating along the optical axis of 3-fold electro - optical crystal  under the action of an applied electric field possesses properties of two - component spinor .",
    "it means that measurements of the optical frequency shift in the single - sideband modulator is similar to measurements of the magnetic moment in the magnetic resonance and anomalous magnetic moment may be associated with the nonlinear frequency shift .",
    "it was understood that the probable value of the characteristic constant is , as maximum , of the order of  nuclear time  @xmath2 sec . @xcite .",
    "such a small value excludes possibility to observe in optical experiments the term calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite    meanwhile the immediate way to determine the frequency superposition law is the transformation for the point rotation frames . emphasize that the maxwell equation do not contain any information about the transformation .",
    "the transformation _ must be postulated_.    in the given paper we consider general linear transformation for the point rotation frames .",
    "we use symmetry of frame coordinates and assume that the reverse frequency is a function of the direct frequency with the same function in vice versa . we show that two different types of the transformation exist . the first type is a generalization of the lorentz transformation .",
    "the type in an experimental sense corresponds to the case of ref .",
    "the second type is principally different .",
    "the type give us a chance to measure the extra term .",
    "we describe an optical experiment for the measurement of the term .",
    "the experiment keeps the main features of that in ref . @xcite",
    "the general form of the linear transformation for the transition from one frame to another can be written as follows @xmath3where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is an angle ( phase ) and time , tilde corresponds to the reverse transformation @xmath6@xmath7 is the frequency of second frame relative to first one .",
    "it is obvious that eq .",
    "( [ trp ] ) turns out into eq .",
    "( [ trn ] ) if variables with tilde change to variables without tilde and vice versa .",
    "first of all we exclude from the consideration the galilean transformation , i.e. , the case @xmath8 . this case with its infinite frequencies seems unbelievable from the viewpoint of contemporary physics .    making normalization@xmath9etc .",
    ", we would arrive to the case @xmath10",
    ". however we can not carry out arbitrary normalization since usually @xmath5 and @xmath4  already determined and connected with the space cartesian coordinates .",
    "generally the point rotation frames is not compatible with the cartesian frame except when the frames are at rest . in this case",
    "if the rotation axis coincides with some cartesian axis we may associate @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the cartesian cylindric angle and time .",
    "the above normalization would result , in particular , in the change of the speed of light .",
    "therefore we must consider here the general case assuming that @xmath11 is a function of @xmath7 .",
    "it means that rotations to the right and left are not equivalent in the approach .    for the point rotation frame",
    "we have not a general principle like the relativity principle for the cartesian frames , however we use principle of symmetry instead .",
    "it means , in particular , that if @xmath12 @xmath13 then @xmath14    the function @xmath15 and @xmath16remain indeterminate except the condition at small @xmath7 , namely , @xmath17 if @xmath18 .",
    "if the characteristic constant @xmath19  is of the order @xmath2 sec .",
    "then the normalized frequency @xmath20 even in microwave range is about @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we assume that the function @xmath15 may be expanded in the powers series in @xmath7 @xmath22this expansion is compatible with the reverse expansion at certain conditions for the coefficients @xmath23 namely , the expansion can not contain only odd powers of @xmath7 and up to term @xmath24 has only  @xmath25 independent coefficients @xmath26 . obviously that any expansion ( [ un])together with the reverse expansion can be written in the  symmetric form with help of finite or infinite series    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a function .",
    "results below will be also valid for arbitrary @xmath29 with the only condition @xmath30 .",
    "the main problem in the given approach is the nonlinear frequency shift .",
    "however since it is defined by product @xmath31 we do not need to know the explicit form of function @xmath32 . for finding the form of @xmath33 we use symmetry between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "transformation ( [ trp ] ) can be written as @xmath34where role of @xmath35 is played by @xmath36 respectively and    @xmath37    it is naturally to assume that the equality in eq .",
    "( [ nugen ] ) would keep if @xmath38 is substituted for @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is a dimensional constant . making use of the substitution and excluding @xmath41 we obtain the equation for @xmath42   @xmath43where @xmath44 . in the given case @xmath45    two type solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqnu ] ) exist .",
    "first type is exact solution @xmath46 or @xmath47transformation ( [ trp ] ) for this case is a generalization of the lorentz transformation . without loss generality",
    "we use here the term the lorentz transformation in spate the fact that @xmath40 may be as positive as negative . from the viewpoint of the experimental checking",
    "this case is equivalent to results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the number of such solutions equals the number of zeros of @xmath51 .",
    "a necessary condition for existence of  the solutions is @xmath52 in expansion ( [ nugen ] ) .",
    "first term in the right part of eq .",
    "( [ qng ] ) determines the frequency superposition law in the first approximation .",
    "the characteristic constant in the given case is @xmath53for simplicity we use the same letter for the characteristic constant in both the types of solutions .",
    "note that expansion ( [ qng ] ) is valid for small @xmath7 .",
    "however at zeros of @xmath54 exact equality @xmath55 holds , i.e. , values @xmath56 are some distinctive points .",
    "the second type of solutions adds to the list one further strange property of the point rotation frames .",
    "normalization @xmath57imparts the lorentz shape to eq .",
    "( [ trp])@xmath58if @xmath59 then @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand the non - normalized transformation at @xmath18 tends to the galilean form   @xmath61where @xmath4 and @xmath5 switch places .",
    "term @xmath62 is very small because of the small value of @xmath63 .    in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ tr3 ] ) consider the time @xmath64 and angle @xmath65 intervals .",
    "the time interval measured at the same value of angle @xmath66 is quite determined  @xmath67 whereas at the same time @xmath68 a time leap @xmath69 exists .",
    "the leap is the time of the rotation through angle @xmath4 at frequency @xmath70 since eq .",
    "( [ tr3 ] ) is the frame transformation into itself the result may be interpreted as  an uncertainty of the time determination .",
    "the maximal value of the leap is @xmath71 as at @xmath72 the frame also coincides with itself .",
    "if the second type truly corresponds to physical reality then a lower limit for measurements of the characteristic constant may be drastically decreased .",

    "the light and the indicatrix , for definiteness , are assumed to rotate in the same direction with frequencies @xmath73 and @xmath7 . in correspondence with eq .",
    "( [ trp ] ) the optical frequency in the frame with the resting optical indicatrix is@xmath74it is obvious that the reverse transition result to exact equality@xmath75however if the reversal rotation occurs then instead of @xmath76 we must substitute @xmath77 in eq .",

    "emphasize that from the viewpoint the maxwell equation the frequency shift in the single - sideband modulator is a consequence of the phase difference between two component of the electric field of light wave whereas from the viewpoint of photons it is something different .",
    "the extra shift may be interpreted as an energy of the polarization reversal .",
