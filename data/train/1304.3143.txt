    "the study of irreversible open quantum dissipative processes is important in almost every field of condensed - matter physics and chemistry , such as reaction rate theory , ultrafast phenomena , tunneling at defects in solids , and quantum optics , _",

    "for open quantum systems , the corresponding account of quantum noise is still an open question .",
    "developing a new and rigorous numerical methodology to simulate open quantum dynamics will provide a novel understanding of eet in biological processes .",
    "system bath hamiltonian with bilinear coupling is the common model to study dissipative dynamics .",
    "particularly , the exciton - phonon coupling hamiltonian has been used to study exciton transport . in the liouville space , the collective motion of environmental phonon modes",

    "the convolution entangles reduced quantum dynamics . as a result",
    ", calculation complexity grows exponentially over the time .",
    "the traditional way to avoid the computational issue is using the different truncation schemes based on cumulant expansion or project operator@xcite in the weak coupling limit .",
    "therefore , the model based on second - order master equations can not accurately describe the interaction of system and bath and introduce the inconsistence about reduced system dynamics . under some special cases , the integral equation based on influence functional",
    "can be reduced to a non - perturbative hierarchical equation of motion ( heom)@xcite and similar ideas have been explored in different contexts@xcite .",
    "but the heom method is very much limited to the drude - lorentzian spectral density ( @xmath0 exponential kernel . )",
    "therefore , heom can not be used for arbitrary spectral densities , requires ad hoc cutoff of the infinite iterative equations and the scaling of the method is nonlinear and unclear .",
    "in addition , approaches based on semiclassical path integral@xcite , hybrid ehrenfest and niba method@xcite , iterative tensor product method @xcite and quantum brownian motion process@xcite have been proposed recently and potentially can be used for the general spectral density cases .",
    "the convolution due to influence functional@xcite makes the computation of reduced system dynamics extremely complicated .",
    "due to the similarity between generalized characteristic function and influence functional , we can map the convolution kernel of influence functional to the covariance matrix of a gaussian process , @xmath1 so , we can linearize the computational effort with the covariance decomposition ( cd ) method to sample the quantum fluctuation of a phonon environment as a complex - valued gaussian random field . in other words , constructing gaussian random field with the cd method can deconvolute the reduced system dynamics .",
    "this method will give us a general computational tool to study the effect of phonon environment on reduced system dynamics in a rigorous and complete way .",

    "the sampling strategy for the complex - valued gaussian random process based on the complex unitary transformation will be the future work .    the coupling part of system bath hamiltonian is critical in determining the interaction between system and environment .",
    "since the coupling is bilinear in the exciton - phonon coupling hamiltonian , the spectral density of the coupling strength between the system and bath is the major factor in relaxation and decoherence processes@xcite .",
    "the cd method will be a computationally efficient tool to study the effect of the arbitrary distribution ( spectral density ) of the linear coupling coefficients on the evolution of reduced density matrix .",
    "two major challenges from the interaction in the current research work are : 1 . the quantum memory effect of phonon environment(non - markovianity ) ; and 2 .",
    "the correlated initial conditions ( inseparability of the system and bath ) . the cd method will allow us to address the two challenges in the same framework . currently , the cd method is base on the influence functional formalism so that the original assumptions of influence functional will be kept @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite have used different approaches to construct to complex - valued gaussian processes .",
    "but the approach we offer here is based on multivariate complex - valued normal distribution function and can take advantage of the established numerical monte carlo methods based on normal distribution functions .",
    "our approach is indifferent to the kernel of influence functional and the choice of spectral density .",
    "for example , you can only generate a markov chain for a gaussian process with a exponential kernel ( gauss - markov model ) corresponding to the high temperature limit of drude spectral density .",
    "for the general spectral density , it is impossible to generate a markov chain to sample the corresponding gaussian process .",
    "so our method is general and efficient .    in the discussion section ,",
    "we like to find out how the shape , such as slope , tail , and center of spectral densities can change the relaxation and coherence of reduced system dynamics .",
    "it is particularly interesting to examine the optical phonon band that have different spectral density from the acoustic one @xcite .",
