    "there is a recent increased interest in @xmath1 .",
    "this concerns the continuum as well as the lattice version of the model ( c.f .",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "the one flavor massless continuum model @xcite is analytically solvable and has been studied extensively .",
    "the reason for the increased interest is that @xmath1 shows @xmath2 like behavior .",
    "this applies especially to the multi flavor situation @xcite .",
    "the maxwell equations for two dimensional electrodynamics also have topologically non trivial @xmath3 solutions with finite action which can be classified by their chern number . these topological objects called instantons are considerably simpler to imagine for @xmath0 in @xmath4 than for @xmath5 in @xmath6 which is an additional appeal to study @xmath1 .",
    "therefore one finds in @xmath1 three closely related problems .",
    "there is the problem of the @xmath7-vacua , which naively speaking are superpositions of all topological sectors corresponding to different chern numbers .",
    "also observed in both models is the occurrence of the @xmath8 problem @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 further allows for a witten - veneziano type formula @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how important these topological nontrivial configurations are indeed for quantum physics .",
    "naively such @xmath9 solutions should not contribute in the functional integration since the subset of such smooth solutions is of measure zero for the measure over @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless the topological susceptibility , which is the first chern character for @xmath1 vice versa the second chern character for @xmath2 , appears in the @xmath11 anomaly .",
    "the lattice situation is quite different .",
    "first of all the lattice regularized version is analytically not solvable . further assuming that the lattice model approximates in a certain limit the continuum model and thus also contributions from topology it is a priori not clear what differential geometry means for a set of points .",
    "any straightforward bundle reconstruction will only lead to trivial bundles with chern number zero .",
    "one way out is to provide the lattice with a very special topology and construct partially ordered sets which allow for non trivial bundles @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 can be also defined on a fuzzy sphere which allows a topological classification in a surprisingly intuitive way via the hopf fibration @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is to regard the lattice as a directed complex with a certain realization like @xmath12 .",
    "this idea was pioneered by lscher @xcite for @xmath5 in @xmath6 and put on a more axiomatic approach in @xcite for @xmath0 in @xmath4 .    without the explicit construction of bundles the @xmath7-vacuum problem and the topological charge problem on the lattice",
    "could also be addressed by possible remnants of the atiyah singer index theorem @xcite . for the numerical simulation of these models",
    "it turns out that _ lattice topological charge _",
    "@xcite leads to an unpleasant problem .",
    "as observed by @xcite the lattice dirac operator indeed shows ( approximate ) zero modes depending on the _ lattice topological charge _ of the configuration .",
    "the lattice dirac operator thus can not be inverted and the numerical procedure breaks down for such configurations , although the measure of the configuration is almost zero .    in this paper",
    "we follow the strategy pioneered by lscher @xcite and assume that the lattice is a directed two - complex with @xmath12 as realization .",
    "we further assume that the topological structure is trivial below a certain scale ( i.e. within a region which is about of the size of a plaquette ) .",
    "this means , that any local pullback connection one - form is a pure gauge .",
    "this assumption is physically justified , since in the continuum limit it is assumed that any local lattice structure does not contribute . formally it shrinks to a point and thus has no structure .",
    "let us introduce the concept of a classical lattice model which is used to approximate classical gauge theory .",
