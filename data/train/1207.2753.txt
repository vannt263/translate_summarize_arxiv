    "the set of rare @xmath9-meson decays mediated by the @xmath3 transition has been thoroughly studied for many years both from the theoretical and experimental sides . recently",
    ", this set has been complemented by increasingly precise experimental measurements of @xmath0-dependent angular observables in the decay @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this has triggered extensive theoretical work studying the constraining power of radiative and semileptonic @xmath9 decays on new physics in the framework of the weak effective hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "these constraints apply mostly to the wilson coefficients @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 related to the magnetic and semileptonic operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the corresponding chirality - flipped operators ( which are highly suppressed in the standard model ) .",
    "in addition , the tight experimental bounds set in the last few months on the differential decay rate of @xmath16 @xcite , pushed it close to its small standard model ( sm ) prediction  @xcite  the theoretical and experimental values are actually brought even closer by the @xmath17 mixing correction @xmath18 to @xmath17 branching ratios measured at lhcb , discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and applied to @xmath16 in ref .",
    "this puts strong constraints on @xmath12 , as well as on the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 of scalar and pseudoscalar operators , specially when combined with @xmath21 data @xcite .",
    "small experimental errors and a good control over hadronic uncertainties on the theory side are the key ingredients for these constraints to be efficient . at present , the branching ratio of the inclusive radiative decay @xmath22 , and the cp asymmetry of @xmath23 constitute the strongest constraints on the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane . however , the complementarity of constraints among different observables can be exploited to reduce considerably the parameter space . in this respect ,",
    "the inclusion of the isospin asymmetry of @xmath23 , together with the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath26 and the longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath27 in @xmath28 integrated over the dilepton invariant mass @xmath0 between 1 and 6 gev@xmath29 already impose additional nontrivial constraints on the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane , as well as on @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this complementarity can be exploited further by considering the @xmath0-dependence of angular @xmath30 observables .",
    "indeed , increasingly precise measurements of these observables integrated in smaller bins are being presented , due in part to the important statistics obtained from the large data sets collected at the lhcb experiment .",
    "this in turn allows for more complete angular analyses providing more observables @xcite .",
    "the prospects for the near future are very good , aiming towards a complete angular analysis with a fine @xmath0-binning .    at this point",
    ", it becomes crucial to handle theoretical uncertainties as accurately as possible .",
    "the lack of huge deviations in @xmath9 physics up to now forces us to be precise and conservative in our theoretical predictions . before claiming any discrepancy , indication or discovery of new physics",
    ", one must be sure that a description in terms of observables with little dependence on the specific choice of hadronic parameters has been used . while the uncertainties related to the form factors",
    "constitute a dominant part of the theoretical error , there is a wide spread of quoted uncertainties for @xmath31 form factors in the recent literature , ranging from a @xmath32 to a @xmath33 error for the same form factor  @xcite .",
    "the size of this error does not depend only on the particular theoretical method used to compute the form factor , but also on the delicate estimation of errors associated to the assumptions built in each procedure .",
    "for example , the values @xmath34 and @xmath35 given in ref .",
    "@xcite should be compared to the values @xmath36 and @xmath37 as quoted in ref .",
    "even central values have shifted significantly , see for instance the value @xmath38 from ref .",
    "@xcite before its update of ref .",
    "@xcite ( also consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite ) . without attempting to discuss the related conceptual issues in any further depth ,",
    "it is clear that the impact of such discrepancies between different groups concerning hadronic uncertainties can be reduced greatly if one selects quantities that show a suppressed dependence on the soft form factors , such as the observables @xmath2 or @xmath39 defined in refs .",
    "these observables can be considered as being theoretically clean in the kinematic range of interest here .",
    "the construction of theoretically clean observables in @xmath30 has been the subject of theoretical work for some time @xcite . based on the symmetries of the @xmath30 angular distribution discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a complete characterization of the full distribution in terms of a minimal basis of clean observables has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that , a complete description of the differential decay rate in the limit of massless leptons and in the absence of scalar contributions can be achieved through a set of 6 clean observables @xmath40 complemented by two observables with a significant sensitivity to form factors , e.g. , the differential decay rate and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath41 ( or equivalently @xmath27 )  . in a short term , these clean observables ( @xmath2 ) should play a leading role in detecting deviations from the sm in a safe way , relegating less clean observables such as @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 to a secondary role of useful cross - checks .",
    "measurements of the transverse asymmetry @xmath45 have been already provided by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , there has recently been some reluctance from the experimental side to extract such clean observables because their theoretical predictions have been mostly presented as functions of @xmath0 , while the experimental results are obtained integrated in @xmath0-bins .",
    "this issue becomes relevant when a coefficient in the angular distribution is expressed as a product of various observables .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors prefer to fit for @xmath27 and @xmath6 instead of @xmath27 and @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 ) , arguing that a rapid variation of both @xmath27 and @xmath45 with @xmath0 could result in a biased estimate of @xmath45 when averaging over large @xmath0-bins .",
    "this is a perfectly correct statement if one wishes to compare the experimental measurements with ( differential ) @xmath0-dependent observables such as @xmath47 .",
    "actually , in the specific case of @xmath45 ( for the sm case as well as for particular np values of the wilson coefficients involved ) , we observed a very good agreement between the observable integrated naively over the low-@xmath0 bins ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) and its value derived from the binned observables as they are being measured ( denoted @xmath49 and defined in the next section ) , showing that the bias is small in this particular case .",
    "though encouraging , this remark will not prevent us from trying to simplify the comparison between theory and experiment by providing theoretical predictions for the _ exact _ integrated quantities as measured in experiments .",
    "these kind of integrated observables have been already discussed in the context of other transverse asymmetries in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we address precisely how to analyse efficiently the lhcb measurements on @xmath50 at large recoil by choosing a set of clean observables integrated over @xmath0-bins .",
    "we begin by building a set of integrated observables that correspond in the limit of small binning to the observables in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the aim of making contact with experimentally measurable quantities . in sections [ sec:2 ] and [ sec : sm ] , we present standard model predictions for these integrated observables , providing the results for different choices of the @xmath0-binning . in section [ sec : const ] we perform a model - independent analysis setting constraints on the wilson coefficients @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , using data from radiative @xmath9 decays and including the forward - backward asymmetry and the longitudinal polarization fraction of @xmath30 , both integrated in the full low-@xmath0 bin @xmath51 $ ] gev@xmath29 .",
    "this updates the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite ( and related analyses ) with several improvements .",
    "we use these results to identify a number of new physics `` benchmark points '' that are allowed at the 95.5% confidence level by all the constraints considered . in section [ sec : comp ] we discuss the potential complementarity of @xmath0-dependent observables in @xmath30 by analyzing our set of clean observables within the np scenarios specified by the benchmark points .",
    "this analysis indicates the scenarios that are more likely to be affected predominantly by the binned observables in @xmath30 .",
    "in section [ sec : s3vsp1 ] we open up a parenthesis to discuss the impact of hadronic uncertainties on the different observables , and the resulting model - independent constraints that follow from different choices of observables .",

    "we extract the experimental values for the three clean observables ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) that can be related to the measurements provided in ref .",
    "our determinations are affected by uncertainties that could be considerably improved , since we lack the experimental information concerning the correlation between the lhcb measurements , which is essential to assess uncertainties in a proper and accurate way .",
    "the constraints from @xmath0-dependent observables are studied in section [ sec : const2 ] .",

    "the following conclusions of this work :    * three ( @xmath56 ) out of the six clean observables describing the massless distribution can already be extracted from current measurements , as shown in section [ sec : exp ] .",
