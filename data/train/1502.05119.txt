    "the difference from the reference sequence gives information about the specific average gate fidelity of the given gate , rather than the average fidelity additionally averaged over the ensemble of gates .",

    "the fundamental result of randomized benchmarking  @xcite is that for sufficiently well - behaved noise the observed fidelities only depend on the average error operation @xmath8 averaged over the clifford group @xmath5 given by @xmath9 as well as any spam errors present in the system .",

    ", we have used the qubit characteristics to numerically simulate randomized benchmarking with a realistic noise model . in the experiment ,",
    "the qubit is defined by the spin state of a single electron . a magnetic field @xmath27 t is applied to create a zeeman splitting and the qubit",
    "is operated using electron spin resonance ( esr ) techniques by applying an ac magnetic field with frequency @xmath28 .",
    "a rabi @xmath29-pulse is realized in @xmath30 s and using a ramsey sequence the dephasing time @xmath31 s has been obtained  @xcite . in between consecutive pulses , a waiting time @xmath32 s has to be incorporated , due to the operation of the analog microwave source .",
    "the set of clifford gates is generated using the set @xmath33 $ ] that are realized using rabi pulses , and the identity simulated with a waiting time equal to a @xmath29-pulse .",
    "the noise processes which determine @xmath34 can be modelled as a random walk of the detuning @xmath35 away from the ideal operation frequency @xmath36 , over timescales greater than a single run of a random clifford sequence . in order to simulate an ensemble of results ,",
    "the @xmath35 term is selected randomly from a gaussian distribution of normalized variance : @xmath37 using this distribution , we have numerically simulated benchmarking experiments and the results are shown in fig . [ fig : gaussianspectrace ] .",
    "the individual traces correspond to a given detuning @xmath35 and result in the `` instantaneous '' fidelity of the qubit . while the individual traces are decaying exponentially , the averaged fidelity ( bold blue ) obtained from the gaussian ensemble is clearly non - exponential .",
    "we have also included the case of a lorentzian distribution of detunings ( red ) , resulting in a non - exponential decay as well . in the simulation ,",
    "the only error source is dephasing , whereas in the experiment , other errors might be present such as pulse - errors .",
    "inclusion of such errors will still result in non - exponential decays , provided dephasing is a significant source of error .",
    "we note that in the experiment , ramsey sequences have been performed in between sequences to recalibrate the resonance frequency of the qubit and to compensate drifts due to , for example , the superconducting magnet .",
    "these drifts , in combination with errors in setting the resonance frequency , result in an apparent @xmath34 in the randomized benchmarking experiment that is dependant upon the duration of the data acquisition , causing a faster decay of the ensemble averaged sequence fidelity .",
    "as low - frequency drift of the qubit resonance frequency can lead to non - exponential fidelity decay , we hypothesize that some ensemble of experiments with varying decay rates is the correct explanation for the non - exponential behaviour of the experimental benchmarking data  @xcite . to support this hypothesis",
    ", we use the akaike information criterion to show that a simple model allowing for differing fidelity rates better explains the data than an alternative explanation that assumes fluctuating spam errors in the standard ( zeroth order ) model .      the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fidelity ] are nuisance parameters that do not convey information about the desired fidelity . eliminating one of these parameters , in this case @xmath20 ,",
    "will further constrain the zero order model and allows deviations to be more clearly identifiable . a further advantage of removing the parameter @xmath20",
    "is to allow fitting of a linear function on a log - linear plot . in ref .",
    "@xcite the randomized benchmarking protocol was modified to eliminate @xmath20 from the zero order model .",
    "we first provide a theoretical justification for this approach , which we note applies only to qubits ( @xmath38 ) , and demonstrate that the resulting data highlight the deviation of the measured data from the expected exponential decay model .",
    "recall that the zero - order model fits the average fidelity of a gate sequence to a simple formula as follows  @xcite : @xmath39 where the qubit is initialized as @xmath40 , the final gate in the random benchmarking sequence is chosen to return the state to @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the survival probability of this state . to eliminate the constant @xmath42 from this sequence",
    "it is only necessary to perform similar randomized sequences , save that the final @xmath43 gate is set to change the state to @xmath44 . for these runs ,",
    "we consider the survival probability for yielding the measurement outcome @xmath45 , where in the ideal case the final state @xmath46 .",
    "this is the survival probability for each run @xmath47 . under the same assumptions we have @xmath48",

    "this amount of randomization is at least an order of magnitude more than in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "each randomized protocol was performed 50 times in order to estimate the survival probability .      to quantify the quality of our fits , we require estimates of the variance in the data of ref .",
    "the observed variance of the data matched to within 5 - 40% of the theoretical upper bounds derived in ref .",
    "@xcite when the gate length was shorter than 20 ( so that the @xmath60 assumption discussed in that reference was satisfied ) .",
    "accordingly , the observed experimental variance was used as a reliable estimate of the actual variance of the distribution .",
    "it should be noted that the observed variance actually decreased for gate lengths of 100 or greater .",
    "one explanation for this unexpected behaviour is that some of the sequences become saturated to something close to a completely mixed state before reaching those sequence lengths .",
    "figure [ fig : fittedplot ] shows the data from the reference dataset plotted on a semi - log plot .",
    "the confidence bounds are 95% and the data is clearly non - linear ( i.e.  the decay is not a simple exponential ) .",
    "similar deviation from the linear fit was noted in each of the data sets , with the best - fit linear model consistently underestimating @xmath24 for @xmath61 .",
    "two possible explanations are considered .",
    "first , it may not be possible to entirely eliminate the constant term ( @xmath20 ) due to a violation of one of the assumptions in the above derivation .",
    "a second explanation is that low - frequency noise leads to detuning , and hence time - dependent errors on the gates in some of the experiments .",
    "the first , which we denote the _ residual spam model _ , can be modelled by reverting to a formula of the form @xmath62 , where now @xmath63 represents residual spam errors that were not eliminated under the assumptions that led to the derivation of eq .",
    "[ eq : nob ] .",
    "we consider the simplest possible model for the second explanation  the _ two fidelity model _  by fitting the fidelity decay to a formula of the form @xmath64 .",
    "this represents an attempt to model the data by simplifying the ensemble of experiments by reducing them to just two different _ equally weighted sequence behaviours : _ one with a high - fidelity rate ( related by the usual measure to @xmath10 ) and one with a lower fidelity rate ( similarly related to @xmath65 ) .",
    "this model has fewer parameters than the gaussian or lorentzian drift models , and is much easier to fit . in this interpretation , we have successfully eliminated the @xmath20 parameter as per eq .",
    "[ eq : nob ] , but time variation gives us the two different polarization parameters @xmath10 and @xmath65 , with the decay rate for each sequence sampled randomly with equal probability .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : fittedplot ] , both models fit the data substantially better than the simple exponential of the zero order model .",
    "although the residual spam model produces a good fit to the experimental data , it does so with the equivalent of an unusually large spam parameter @xmath63 of around 0.14 , corresponding to a @xmath42 of 0.57 .",
    "this represents in the theoretical model a very large bias in the expectation value of the spin - up measurement on the completely mixed state away from 0.5 , which is not observed in the experiment .",
    "this suggests that this model may not be best for explaining the observed data .",

    "we have analyzed the non - exponential decay in randomized benchmarking experiments on si - mos quantum dot qubits , and found that the most plausible explanation of this decay is drift in detuning frequencies .",
    "our simulation of temporal integration over a spectrum of time - dependent detuning frequencies qualitatively reproduces the observed fidelity decay of previously conducted experiments  @xcite .",

    "we anticipate that this value is the relevant fidelity for quantifying the achievable performance of these gates for quantum computation , since improvements in the readout fidelity and use of a fast ramsey protocol to calibrate the resonance frequency for each experiment  @xcite could result in an ensemble fidelity that matches the best instantaneous fidelity which is ultimately defined by fixed errors .    these results raise several intriguing questions .",
    "the first is to quantitatively link the simple and easy to analyze two fidelity model to the gaussian or lorentzian drift models . alternatively , directly fitting a drift ensemble to the data would give a better picture of the source of the non - exponential fidelity decay , but this approach risks overfitting , and is already difficult for the simple case of gaussian - distributed detunings .",
