    "dark matter is omnipresent in the universe .",
    "most of it is non - baryonic , and a favoured candidate is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , often generically taken to be the lightest stable relic particle surviving from when the universe was supersymmetric .",
    "the freeze - out of such a neutralino of mass @xmath0 occurs at @xmath1 , and the annihilation cross - section determines the current value of the cdm density @xmath2 for minimal susy , for example , one can derive the relation between annihilation cross - section and particle mass , and compute the various annihilation products , including continuum gamma rays from @xmath3 decays and line gamma rays from rare quark decays ( c.f .",
    "bergstrm 2000 for a recent review ) .",
    "while cosmological observations specify @xmath4 scanning over minimal susy parameter space results in an uncertainty in the gamma - ray emissivity of several orders of magnitude .    our galactic halo is a logical place to look for evidence of annihilations .",
    "unfortunately , for a uniform dark halo with a realistic density profile , even the most optimistic models fall short of the observed diffuse high - galactic - latitude gamma - ray flux , as measured by egret , by an order of magnitude or more ( ullio et al .",
    "in fact , high - resolution numerical simulations show that the dark halo has considerable substructure ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "this substructure may boost the annihilation flux substantially .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the isotropic diffuse background flux from the many small halos that merged in the past into our halo and others may also become significant .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty among cosmological halo simulators , however , about the quantitative role of substructure in our dark halo , and of the concentration of the substructure and of the dark matter itself towards the centre of the galaxy .",
    "no reliable estimates have been given up till now of the properties of halo substructure on very small scales , and in particular of their dependence on halo mass and their evolution with cosmological epoch .",
    "we have developed a semi - analytical model of halo formation which is capable of following the key physics of tidal disruption of substructure during merging . in principle",
    "this approach has arbitrarily high resolution .",
    "hence we are able to provide robust calculations of the annihilation flux generated within our own halo , but also especially of the component generated during the evolution of structure at early times , and visible as an isotropic gamma - ray background at the present day .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the flux produced by annihilations in simple cdm halos , relative to the flux produced in a uniform background .",
    "we correct this result for halo substructure , and integrate over a large volume to determine the cosmological background from wimp annihilation as a function of redshift .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define a dimensionless flux multiplier @xmath5 that accounts for the enhanced rate of two - body interactions produced by inhomogeneities in the dark matter distribution , and determine its value for simple virialised halos . in section 3 we calculate @xmath5 for cosmological volumes , using analytic estimates of the halo mass function and halo concentrations , and determine its redshift dependence .",
    "finally , in section 4 we study the contribution to @xmath5 from substructure within virialised halos , and calculate @xmath5 for a set of realistic halos generated using a semi - analytic model of halo substructure . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a lambda - cdm ( lcdm ) cosmology with a cosmological constant @xmath6 , a matter density @xmath7 and a hubble parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "in current hierarchical models , cold dark matter is expected to form centrally concentrated halos with a characteristic density profile .",
    "dense substructure is abundant within these halos , as a relic from earlier stages of the hierarchical merging process .",
    "since the annihilation flux is quadratic in the density , these inhomogeneities will increase the flux from a halo of a given mean density .",
    "we begin by computing a dimensionless quantity that describes this enhancement . in the next section",
    "we will then study the evolution of this quantity with epoch .",
    "if dark matter consists of neutralinos with a mass @xmath0 and a velocity - averaged cross - section for annihilation @xmath10 , then the annihilation flux produced within a volume @xmath11 will be @xmath12[fluxm0 ] where @xmath13 is the local density of cdm . for non - relativistic particles ,",
    "@xmath10 is approximately independent of @xmath14 so the flux will just be proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "since the rate depends quadratically on the density , the total rate from a given mass within a given volume will be higher if the dark matter is distributed inhomogeneously .",
    "we can study this enhancement by defining the dimensionless flux multiplier @xmath16 for a distribution within a volume @xmath11 , where @xmath17 is the average density within this volume .",
    "this function can also be written as a mass - weighted density average : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total mass within @xmath11 .",
    "clearly @xmath20 for a homogeneous distribution , while for a power - law density profile @xmath21 , @xmath22 provided @xmath23 . for @xmath24 , integrating equation ( [ fluxm1 ] ) from @xmath25 to @xmath26 gives : @xmath27 so @xmath5 diverges logarithmically as @xmath25 goes to zero .",
    "two analytic density profiles are commonly used to fit the spherically averaged properties of dark matter halos , the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 ) , and the moore profile ( moore et al .",
    "we can specify these generically as @xmath28 with @xmath29 for the nfw profile and @xmath30 for the moore profile .",
    "the total mass within radius @xmath31 is @xmath32 with @xmath33 for the nfw profile and @xmath34 for the moore profile , while the mean density within this radius is simply @xmath35 where @xmath36 .    in a cosmological",
    "setting , halos are virialised out to a radius @xmath37 corresponding to an overdensity @xmath38 of roughly 200 relative to the background",
    ". the concentration @xmath39 of a halo describes the size of this radius relative to @xmath40 .. ] calculating the flux multiplier over the virialised region of a halo , we get a function which depends only on @xmath41 : @xmath42 thus for the nfw profile @xmath43 with a limiting value of @xmath44 for small @xmath41 , whereas for the moore profile , @xmath45 @xmath46^c_{x_{\\rm min}}.   \\label{eq : moore_fc}\\ ] ] this expression diverges logarithmically as @xmath47 goes to zero , reflecting the fact that the flux from a pure @xmath48 cusp is infinite . in practice , annihilation would reduce the density at the centre of the halo to a finite value even for pure cdm , while in real halos baryons will also affect halo structure on small scales .",
    "furthermore , the simulations that indicate central cusps in halos can only probe down to @xmath49 , or @xmath50 ( power et al .",
    "2002 ) ; below this scale , it is possible that the slope of the profile continues to change ( taylor & navarro 2001 ) .",
    "thus in what follows we will consider moore profiles truncated at various inner cutoff radii , either @xmath51 ( profile m1 hereafter ) , @xmath52 ( profile m2 hereafter ) , @xmath53 ( profile m3 hereafter ) , or @xmath54 ( profile m4 hereafter ) , with cores of constant density within the cutoff radius .",
    "( adding a core modifies equations ( [ eq : nfw_fc ] ) and ( [ eq : moore_fc ] ) slightly , but the difference is negligible for @xmath55 . )",
    "the first cutoff corresponds the scale on which annihilation alone might truncate a pure power - law density profile ( clcneo - roldan & moore 2000 ) and the third cutoff corresponds to the largest core consistent with the results of current high - resolution simulations , while the fourth cutoff corresponds to the limit of the region within which baryons might plausibly have flattened out the core in the halos of massive galaxies .      as mentioned above , the simulations that provide evidence for a universal density profile for cdm halos can only reliably resolve two decades of radius below the virial radius . while the logarithmic slope appears to converge to a value between @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the inner regions , it is clearly not a simple power - law in the outer regions , where it flattens substantially over a decade in radius .",
    "thus , there remains the possibility that the inner slope of cdm halos , were it resolved to smaller radii , would continue to change in value . a shallower inner slope would help to explain the rotation curves of dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxies ( e.g.  blais - ouellette , amram , & carignan 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ) , as well as the mass distribution of the milky way within the solar circle ( binney & evans 2001 ) .",
    "one possible form for such a profile was proposed by taylor and navarro ( 2001 , tn hereafter ) . in the outer regions",
    "it resembles the nfw or moore profiles , while in the inner regions ( below about @xmath58 ) , its logarithmic slope decreases slowly to @xmath59 .",
    "an analytic fit to the inner slope is : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "we will calculate @xmath63 , which is convergent and well - behaved for this profile , from a direct numerical integration , although it can be computed to reasonable accuracy using the fitting formula above . from equation ( [ powlaw ] ) , the limiting value for small @xmath41 is @xmath64 .",
    "note that in its outer regions , the equilibrium density profile derived by tn goes to zero at a finite radius .",
    "this assumes an equilibrium that will never be achieved in cosmological setting , however , where halos will continue to accrete material onto their outer parts . thus , we assume that beyond @xmath65 , the profile drops off as @xmath66 , as in the nfw and moore fits .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the density profiles ( top panel ) and @xmath67 ( bottom panel ) for the six profiles discussed above , including four versions of the moore profile with different constant - density cores ( within radii indicated by the horizontal dashed lines ) . in order to compare the different profiles ,",
    "they have been plotted in terms of @xmath68 , the radius relative to the point @xmath69 at which the circular velocity peaks , and normalised so that the density is the same at @xmath69 .    in the top panel ,",
    "we see that all the density profiles aside from m4 are in excellent agreement for @xmath70 , the region probed by current simulations .",
    "existing simulations are roughly compatible with any of the fits shown here . the differences in the inferred central behaviour of halos are based on different interpretations of the density profile very close to the current numerical resolution limit .",
    "the bottom panel shows the effect of this uncertainty on @xmath63 , where @xmath41 is measured relative to @xmath69 , as in the top panel .",
    "we see that in each case , the flux multiplier increases with concentration , reflecting the contribution from the dense central core .",
    "to first approximation , the dependence on @xmath41 is independent of profile , while the inner slope of the halo profile determines the overall normalisation of @xmath63 . for the moore profile",
    "it is 225 times larger than for an nfw profile , while for the shallower tn profile it is comparable to a moore profile with a core between 1% and 10% of @xmath40 in size .",
    "the solid vertical lines on the plot indicate typical values of @xmath41 for present - day galaxies and clusters . for galaxy halos ,",
    "@xmath63 is typically 50 for an nfw profile , 200 for the tn profile or profile m2 , and 1200 for the most extreme moore profile , m1 .",
    "for all profiles it scales with concentration as roughly @xmath71 in this range of @xmath41 , as indicated by the solid line in the corner of the figure .",
    "this figure indicates the importance of the inner region in determining the total flux from annihilating dark matter .",
    "if recent simulations are correct , it seems likely that this flux may be 24 times larger than that predicted for a pure nfw profile ; in the extreme case of a moore profile with an inner cusp limited only by self - annihilation , the total flux is 25 times the nfw value .",
    "since the dependence on @xmath72 is similar for all profiles , in what follows we will assume the nfw form for @xmath63 , and allow that the flux may be a constant 225 times greater than this .",
    "to calculate the background flux from annihilations within a large volume , we need to add the relative contributions from regions of different density within this volume . following the press - schechter approximation ( press & schechter 1974 )",
    ", we can consider all the mass in a given ( physical ) volume @xmath11 to be contained in virialised halos of some ( possibly very small ) mass .",
    "we make the further approximation that these halos are spherical , with a fixed virial overdensity @xmath38 relative to the critical density , and have universal density profiles with a concentration @xmath73 that depends only on their mass .",
    "if the volume contains @xmath74 halos in the mass range @xmath19 to @xmath75 , then from equation ( [ fluxm1 ] ) , the total flux multiplier for the volume will be @xmath76 where @xmath13 is the mean density of dark matter within @xmath11 , @xmath77 is the average density of bound halos , and @xmath78 is the flux multiplier for halos of concentration @xmath79 . since @xmath80 , we can rewrite the dimensionless flux multiplier for large volumes as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the fraction of the universe in virialised halos of mass @xmath19 or larger .",
    "@xmath83 can be estimated using the press - schechter formalism : @xmath84 with @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the critical overdensity and @xmath87 describes the power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "recent simulations ( e.g.  jenkins et al .",
    "1998 ) have suggested , however , that this mass function may overestimate the number of halos near @xmath88 , the characteristic mass for which @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is the linear growth factor at redshift @xmath91 ) .",
    "an alternative mass function , proposed by sheth and tormen ( 1999 ) and based on the ellipsoidal collapse model , is : @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "since both these mass functions have a power - law behaviour at low masses , where concentrations and thus @xmath63 are larger , it is not clear the integral in equation ( [ locvol ] ) will converge as we include the contribution from smaller and smaller halos .",
    "( although the total mass per unit volume must converge , @xmath5 within a given volume need not converge , as in the case of a pure @xmath48 density profile . ) in practice , we expect baryonic phenomena to complicate structure formation on small mass scales , and annihilation itself will also limit the contribution from very dense material .",
    "thus , we will truncate the integral at some limiting mass , and consider the behaviour of @xmath5 as a function of this mass limit .",
    "the concentration of a halo should reflect the density of the universe at the time when it assembled the material now in its central core .",
    "there are several predictions of the concentration - mass relation ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; eke , navarro , & steinmetz 2001 ; wechsler et al .",
    "2002 ) , based on this interpretation .",
    "we will use the most recent analytic model , that of eke , navarro , & steinmetz ( 2001  ens hereafter ) , to calculate the dimensionless flux multiplier , though we expect similar results from the other models .",
    "we use the public code supplied by the authors to calculate concentrations , and integrate the expressions above numerically . note that one point of uncertainty in all these models is what minimum concentration to assign to halos that have just formed .",
    "the ens code , for instance , predicts concentrations of 1 or less for very massive or very high - redshift halos , but the least concentrated halos actually found in their simulations have @xmath95 23 . for recently formed objects",
    "the universal profile may not be well established , so any uncertainty produced by varying the minimum concentration reflects the limitations of the analytic model .",
    "the top panel of figure 2 shows the dimensionless flux multiplier contributed by halos over some limiting mass , at various epochs in a lcdm cosmology , plotted as a function of the mass limit .",
    "the solid lines show the results for the ps mass function , while the dashed lines show the results for the st mass function .",
    "we see that in either case , the total flux is more or less convergent as we include smaller and smaller masses ; at @xmath96 , it only varies by a factor of 2 , for instance , for a limiting mass anywhere between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the value is also reasonably independent of the mass function used ; it is at most 2 times larger for the ps mass function .",
    "the uncertainties in halo concentrations are only important at high redshift , when many halos have recently formed .",
    "we have actually plotted two sets of curves in figure 2 , one with a minimum concentration of 1 ( the lower set of lines at each redshift ) and one with a minimum concentration of 2 ( the upper set ) , but the difference between them is negligible for @xmath99 . finally , the total flux multiplier increases with time , reflecting the progressive growth of structure . of course the density of the universe is decreasing at the same time ,",
    "so the flux relative to that at the present day is larger at high redshift ; this is shown in the bottom panel , where we have used the present - day density to normalise @xmath5 .",
    "this increased flux will partly compensate for the decreased volume element at high redshift , as discussed below .      in previous section",
    "we have derived the flux multiplier for a local volume , large enough to contain a representative sample of halos , but small enough that evolutionary effects are negligible . in a similar fashion",
    "we can extend the definition of @xmath5 to entire observable universe . consider the expression for @xmath5 integrated over volume elements @xmath100 at different scale factors @xmath101 , to some maximum @xmath102 @xmath103 where we have chosen to normalise by the present - day density of the universe , @xmath104 , @xmath105",
    "is given by equation ( [ locvol ] ) , and the last term corrects for the time dilation at a given epoch . since @xmath106 ,",
    "this is equivalent to the following integral over redshift : @xmath107 for the lcdm cosmology considered here .",
    "one quantity of interest is the relative contribution to the flux per interval of time , @xmath108 , which is plotted as a function of redshift in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the four sets of lines indicate the contribution from mass functions truncated at the different minimum masses indicated .",
    "the line styles indicate the results for ps and st mass functions .",
    "we see that the relative contribution peaks at quite early redshifts , roughly the epoch when the smallest halos considered have formed , as indicated by the arrows . at higher redshift",
    ", it drops off sharply , because there are very few halos over the mass limit considered , while at lower redshift it drops off more gradually , as small , dense systems merge to form larger systems of lower density .",
    "the latter drop - off may be overestimated , however , since the cores of dense halos may not be disrupted by merging , but may survive instead as distinct substructure within larger systems .",
    "we consider this effect in the next section .",
    "in cosmologies dominated by cdm , large halos assemble hierarchically through successive mergers between smaller objects .",
    "this merging process is inefficient , and leaves many undigested remnants , or subhalos , orbiting within a galaxy or cluster halo .",
    "the properties of these objects have been studied extensively in several recent , high - resolution scdm and lcdm simulations ( ghigna et al .  1998 ; klypin et al .  1999 ;",
    "moore et al .  1999 ; springel et al .  2001 ) , and can also be understood using analytic and semi - analytic models ( bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ; taylor 2001 ; benson et al .",
    "2002 ; somerville 2002 ) .",
    "the latter have the advantage that the properties of the underlying halos can be specified directly , and are independent of resolution and numerical effects . in this section",
    "we use a recently developed semi - analytic model of halo formation ( taylor & babul in preparation ; see also taylor 2001 ) to determine the flux multiplier for a realistic halo with substructure , at various different epochs .      from equation [ fluxm2 ] ,",
    "the relative contribution to the flux multiplier from an individual subhalo within a larger halo is proportional to @xmath109 , where the subscript @xmath110 indicates the subhalo and the subscript @xmath111 indicates the average for the background system in which it resides .",
    "this implies that if subhalos are substantially denser or more concentrated than the main system , they can dominate @xmath5 , even though they only contribute to a small fraction of the total mass of the system .",
    "this is particularly true since tidal stripping will remove the lowest - density material from substructure , increasing the relative contribution from the material which remains bound .",
    "more precisely , if we decompose the density of cdm within a halo into two components , a smooth background following the basic profiles given in section 2 , and a set of subhalos which have been stripped to varying degrees , then @xmath112 the contribution to @xmath5 then consists of several terms @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the mass , concentration and volume of the main system , and @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the corresponding properties of each subhalo . in deriving the final result",
    ", we have assumed that the subhalos do not overlap , and that each one is small compared to the main system , so that @xmath120 is more or less constant within the volume covered by a given subhalo .",
    "the function @xmath121 is the dimensionless flux multiplier defined in section 1 , modified to account for the effects of tidal heating and stripping , which may change the density profile of the subhalos as they orbit within the main system .",
    "we derive an expression for this function in terms of the original profile and the amount of mass lost below .",
    "the density profiles considered in section ( [ sec : simple ] ) characterise isolated halos ; interactions between halos or mergers with larger systems will modify these profiles through a combination of tidal heating and tidal mass loss .",
    "numerical simulations show that tidal effects tend to strip mass off the outer regions of a halo preferentially , preserving the central density of the halo until it has lost a large fraction of its original mass .",
    "hayashi et al .  ( 2002 ) propose the following modification of the density profile to describe this process : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the tidal radius to which the halo is stripped , and @xmath124 is the reduction in the central density . for a halo with an nfw profile and an original concentration of 10 , they find that these parameters are related to the fraction @xmath125 of the original mass still bound to the halo by @xmath126    using this modified density profile , we can calculate @xmath127 , the flux multiplier for tidally stripped halos .",
    "this should be a function of @xmath128 , the original concentration of the halo , and @xmath129 , the concentration of the stripped system . in practice",
    ", we shall consider @xmath130 since this was the profile modeled by hayashi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in defining @xmath127",
    ", we also need to choose an appropriate volume over which to integrate .",
    "since the modified density profile in equation ( [ hayashi1 ] ) is not truncated completely at @xmath123 , we could continue to integrate over the original volume ; in this case , @xmath121 would rise sharply ( roughly as @xmath131 ) as the mass of the halo is confined to a smaller and smaller region of the original volume . since @xmath123 roughly defines the region in which the subhalo density profile dominates over the background , the approximation made in deriving equation ( [ subst3 ] ) will be more accurate if we define @xmath127 over the volume within @xmath123 . in any case , in this section we will show the results of the calculation for several possible choices of volume , to clarify the effect on @xmath127 .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows @xmath130 for the volume within @xmath132 ( dashed line ) , @xmath133 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath134 ( dot - dashed line ) , with @xmath135 shown for comparison ( solid line ) .",
    "the truncated functions differ from the original one at @xmath136 because the density profile given by equation ( [ hayashi1 ] ) is different from the unstripped one even when @xmath137 .",
    "we see however that if we consider the volume within @xmath123 ( dotted curve ) , @xmath138 to good approximation .",
    "we will assume that this result remains true for halos with larger or smaller original concentrations , provided @xmath139 , and use this to calculate the contribution to the total flux from evolved subhalos .",
    "using equations ( [ subst3 ] )  ( [ hayashi3 ] ) , we can calculate the total flux multiplier for composite systems with substructure .",
    "to do so , we use a semi - analytic model of halo formation ( taylor & babul in preparation ; see also taylor 2001 ) to determine the number , masses , density profiles and positions of subhalos within a set of hierarchically formed halos .",
    "we have followed halo substructure down to @xmath140 times the mass of the main system .",
    "since the spectrum of substructure is fairly steep at low masses , the total flux multiplier may depend on this cutoff , so we will consider our results as a function mass limit , as in section ( [ sec : cosmo ] ) , and extrapolate downwards to estimate the total flux multiplier for smaller limiting masses .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:5 ] shows the relative contribution to the flux multiplier contributed by substructure over a minimum mass limit @xmath141 , as a function of @xmath141 , in models using nfw profiles .",
    "the contribution has been normalised to the value @xmath142 expected for a smooth nfw halo without substructure .",
    "the solid curves are average results for a set of semi - analytic galaxy halos with a total mass of @xmath143 , in a lcdm cosmology . the dashed vertical line indicates the resolution limit of the merger trees used ; below this , the spectrum of subhalos becomes increasingly incomplete , particularly below @xmath144 . at high redshift ,",
    "where the halos are forming through major mergers around this mass scale , the curves are steep so the flux estimate will depend sensitively on the mass limit . at low redshift ,",
    "the effect of the mass limit is less important , as most of the flux comes from more massive subhalos . in either case",
    ", however , the total flux appears to have a power - law dependence on @xmath145 at low masses , so it is straightforward to extrapolate our estimates to lower mass limits .",
    "overall , we see that substructure makes an important contribution to total flux right up to the present day , when it exceeds the contribution from the background halo .",
    "the bottom panel shows the redshift dependence of the contribution more clearly , for two different mass limits , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "as expected , at high redshift the contribution from substructure increases somewhat faster as we lower @xmath145 , reflecting the steep slope of the high - redshift curves in the top panel , while at low redshift the increase is slower .",
    "if we extrapolate the power - law dependence seen in the top panel to smaller values of @xmath145 such as @xmath148@xmath149 , we expect a net contribution from substructure of anywhere from 10 to 20 times the smooth background value for the nfw profile .",
    "we can determine the effect of substructure on the gamma - ray background by correcting the relative contribution calculated in section ( [ ssec : univ ] ) for the additional contribution from substructure in shown in figure [ fig:5 ] ; this is indicated by the dashed lines in figure [ fig:6 ] , for halos with nfw profiles , and mass cutoffs of @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we see that when substructure is taken into account , the flux multiplier still peaks just after the epoch when @xmath150 and declines at lower redshift , but both the peak value and the value at @xmath96 are substantially enhanced .",
    "we note that the peak and subsequent decline may partly compensate for the cosmological factor @xmath151 and for intervening absorption , which reduce the high - redshift contribution to the gamma - ray background .",
    "we will investigate the detailed line and continuum spectra predicted by this model in a subsequent paper .",
    "we have calculated the amount by which structure in dark matter on subhalo , halo and cosmological scales amplifies the expected signal from neutralino annihilation .",
    "the overall magnitude of the effect remains uncertain at several levels , some more important than others .",
    "uncertainty in the fundamental density profile which characterises halos , or more specifically in the slope of their density profiles at small radii , can change the flux multiplier for simple halos by a factor of 2025 , assuming concentrations typical of galaxy halos ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "there is evidence in recent simulations for some excess mass in the inner regions , relative to the nfw profile ( power et al .",
    "2002 ) , so a reasonable estimate for the flux multiplier may be 34 times the nfw value used for most of the calculations in this paper , although studies of the milky way ( e.g.  binney & evans 2001 ) suggest less dark matter in its central regions than these profiles would imply . there is no direct evidence for a pure moore profile extending to very small scales , although if this is the case the resulting flux from simple halos will be 2025 times the nfw value used here .",
    "the mass function of dark matter halos , averaged over large volumes , is also uncertain , particularly at the low mass end .",
    "the mass function determined from simulations is better fit by the form proposed by sheth and tormen ( st ) than by the traditional press and schechter ( ps ) mass function . using the st mass function to predict the background flux reduces its amplitude by about 1.5 over ps .",
    "we assume that the scale invariance of dark matter substructure will be broken at very small masses , perhaps close to jeans mass at recombination , for instance . at a minimum",
    ", there should be some maximum density for dark matter halos , or equivalently some maximum for @xmath87 at early times .",
    "varying the lower mass limits over a reasonable range ( @xmath152@xmath153 ) changes the flux by a factor of 2 or so for simple halos , but the contribution from substructure may increase this difference to as much as a factor of 40 .",
    "overall , these uncertainties combine to produce a total uncertainty of more than an order of magnitude in the flux multiplier . a conservative model , at the bottom of this range , consists of an nfw profile , with a st mass function and a mass limit of @xmath154 . for this model ,",

    "the 86 gev neutralino considered in bergstrm , edsj , & ullio ( 2001 ) , for instance , produced almost 10% of the gamma - ray background observed by egret at 1 gev , assuming a flux multiplier of @xmath159 , while a 166 gev neutralino produced more than 50% of the flux observed at 10 gev .",

    "<S> we examine the expected signal from annihilation events in realistic cold dark matter halos . if the wimp is a neutralino , with an annihilation cross - section predicted in minimal susy models for the lightest stable relic particle , the central cusps and dense substructure seen in simulated halos may produce a substantial flux of energetic gamma rays . </S>",
    "<S> we derive expressions for the relative flux from such events in simple halos with various density profiles , and use these to calculate the relative flux produced within a large volume as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> this flux peaks when the first halos collapse , but then declines as small halos merge into larger systems of lower density . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that halos contain a substantial amount of dense substructure , left over from the incomplete disruption of smaller halos as they merge together . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the contribution to the flux due to this substructure , and show that it can increase the annihilation signal substantially . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the present - day flux from annihilation events may be an order of magnitude larger than predicted by previous calculations . </S>",
