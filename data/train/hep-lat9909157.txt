    "this problem can be addressed in a simple 1 dimensional lattice . in this case , with a lattice spacing @xmath0 , the first derivative of a fermion field @xmath1 , is calculated in the first approximation of the finite difference method , @xmath2 the fourier transform of an infinite and periodic lattice is the brillouin zone , a continuous interval @xmath3-\\pi,\\pi]$ ] , and the functions are transformed as , @xmath4 which we substitute in eqs .",

    "it is natural to replace @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and we get the correct behavior , @xmath8 however , one should check all the points where the numerator @xmath9 vanish in the brillouin zone . in fig .",
    "[ brillouin ] we see in fact that @xmath9 has two similar roots in the brillouin zone , at @xmath10 and at @xmath11 .",
    "this is the source of the doubler problem .",
    "( 240,260)(0,0 ) ( -64,-20 )    in the literature many methods to avoid the doubling of fermion species on the lattice are presented .",
    "a simple solution of this lattice problem would be convenient for the study of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd and for the study of neutrinos in the standard model .",
    "wilson @xcite included in the action extra hopping terms which projected out the doublers from the onset .",
    "however this was not chiral invariant , and kogut @xcite proposed the staggered fermions to improve chiral invariance .",
    "nielsen and ninomiya @xcite produced a topological no - go theorem concerning chiral invariant lattice models with local charge conservation and a local action . to avoid these restrictions , there are some very interesting solutions in the literature which depart from the simple wilson action .",
    "kaplan @xcite extends the lattice with an extra dimension . and places the physical fermions in a domain wall .",
    "t hooft @xcite recommends to have continuum fermions with lattice bosons .",
    "neuberger @xcite redefines the matrix which is used in the fermion determinant , and finds a topologically nontrivial solution to the ginsparg - wilson @xcite relation .",
    "this opens a new perspective to the study of chiral symmetry @xcite , and the study of the chiral anomaly on the lattice .",
    "the method presented in this paper belongs to the class of non - local actions @xcite .",
    "we now show a 1 dimensional example where the doubles are factorized from the propagator .",
    "we find it more intuitive to place the fermion fields at the vertices of the lattice zones ( dual lattice ) because we are tempted to replace the periodic function @xmath9 by the anti - periodic @xmath12 which has a single root . to get this new function , which is wider in the momentum representation , see fig .",
    "[ brillouin ] , one has to narrow the spacing @xmath13 used in the denominator of the derivative .",
    "we will later shift our lattice back to the conventional one , the use of the dual lattice here is not crucial .",
    "the first approximation of the finite difference method is now , @xmath14 and we obtain the desired function .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath15 for the interpolated spinor at the site @xmath16 of the lattice , which is simply the mean value of the spinors which are placed at the vertices of the zone , @xmath17 we find that the constant term ( [ interpol ] ) , in sense that it is not the first derivative term , has a root at @xmath11 .",
    "this is the extra root which was present in the first definition ( [ deriva1 ] ) of the derivative .    with the interpolated fields ( [ derivanova ] ) and ( [ interpol ] ) , we define a free dirac action in 1 dimension",
    ", @xmath18 were the @xmath19 relations , @xmath20 were used .",
    "we can check that both the mass term ( one double root ) and the derivative term ( two different roots ) of the dirac action ( [ dirac ] ) have two roots .",
    "thus this action complies with the nielsen and ninomiya topological theorem @xcite .",
    "we see that there are still 2 roots , @xmath21 and @xmath11 in the lagrangian ( [ dirac ] ) , but only the first root is dynamical in the sense that it depends on the fermion mass .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to define a propagator @xmath22 which only shows the correct pole in the denominator , and no double , @xmath23 where the @xmath24 in the numerator , which cancels the extra root in the denominator , comes from the interpolation of the fermion fields in the definition of the propagator .",
    "the extra root is replaced by a pole .",
    "the propagator ( [ propagator1 ] ) has the right continuum limit , @xmath25 for a finite spacing @xmath0 , we can see in fig .",
    "[ brillouin ] that this propagator also has the peculiar property @xmath26 , which increases the effect of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath27 in fermions .",
    "this is in contradistinction with @xmath28 .    in the next section",
    "ii we define the factorization procedure in detail , for a lattice in @xmath29 dimensions . in section",
    "iii gauge invariance is implemented . in section",
    "iv the factorization is adapted to the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "the conclusion is in section v. in appendix a an equivalent factorization is studied , and in appendix b we study lattices where fermions and antifermions are in separate sites .",
    "we now extend the action ( [ dirac ] ) to the @xmath29 dimensional case , and factorize the doubles from the propagator and the fermion determinant . in this section",
    "we study free fermions which can be exactly solved in the momentum representation",
    ". however the factorizing procedure must be applicable in position space , in order to include eventually the gauge fields , and to compute the propagator and the determinant with the standard lattice techniques . at this point",
    "we have to leave the dual lattice which was used just for the introduction . in order to write the interpolated spinors , it is convenient to define the class of vectors @xmath30 , with components @xmath31 . in @xmath29 dimensions ,",
    "the interpolated spinors are now extended to , @xmath32 to translate the fields back to the standard positions @xmath33 we apply a shift of @xmath34 on the action ( [ dirac ] ) .",
    "this shift leaves the momentum representation of the action invariant .",
    "the action is now , @xmath35 where we use the convention of hermitean dirac matrices @xmath36 .",
    "the action ( [ naction2 ] ) can be written in a matricial form , @xmath37 where the sites are labeled by the @xmath38 , which are @xmath29-dimensional vectors with integer components .",
    "like the wilson fermion action @xcite , this action includes extra hopping terms . in the present case the chiral non - invariant terms",
    "are all included in the mass term . in eq .",
    "( [ matrixaction ] ) the matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 are translational invariant , in the sense that the matrix elements only depend on the distance to the diagonal .",
    "the fourier transform of these matrices depends on a single momentum , @xmath41 and from eq .",
    "( [ interpoln ] ) we get the fourier transforms , @xmath42 we define the quark propagator @xmath22 with the green equation , @xmath43 this green equation ( [ green ] ) is an extended version of the normal one .",
    "here we replace the usual identity matrix in the right hand side by the matrix @xmath39 .",
    "the action with no doubles is finally defined , @xmath44 where the matrix @xmath45 , in the limit of massless quarks is chiral invariant . like the neuberger matrix @xcite , the final matrix @xmath46 is redefined from the initial action ( [ naction2 ] ) . using the delta relations ( [ deltas ] ) we find the momentum representation of the action , @xmath47   \\nonumber \\\\ & & =   m+i   { 2 \\over a } \\sum_j \\gamma_j   \\tan { k_j \\over 2 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the new action has no extra roots and has the correct continuum limit . this result can be compared with the literature . except for the mass term , we recover the zenkin action @xcite , which was derived in the formalism of a path integral with the weyl quantization .",
    "we now include the coupling of the fermions to the gauge fields , using the wilson @xcite prescription . in order to have a gauge invariant action ,",
    "the fermion operators @xmath48 and @xmath1 are usually linked by gauge transformation paths when they are in different sites . in the case of a elementary link @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the generators of the gauge group , and the gauge - invariant version of @xmath52 is , @xmath53 in the present case we have to connect @xmath54 and @xmath55 of action ( [ naction2 ] ) by a gauge link .",
    "because each of the @xmath29 components of @xmath56 can be equal to @xmath57 or @xmath58 , this gauge link can be constituted by a product @xmath59 of up to @xmath29 concatenated elementary orthogonal elementary links .",
    "then there are different paths which connect @xmath54 and @xmath60 , and it is convenient to use the average of all the possible paths , or to choose a single path in a random way . with the links included , the @xmath39 and @xmath61 terms in eq .",
    "( [ matrixaction ] ) are gauge invariant an so is the new action ( [ finalaction ] ) .    including the gauge coupling , the fermion part of the action ( [ finalaction ] )",
    "is extended to , @xmath62 in the continuum limit @xmath63 tends to a vanishing constant .",
    "this action ( [ gaugeaction ] ) is the one that we propose for the study of light fermions .    in the limit of a constant @xmath63 and using the @xmath19 relations ( [ deltas ] ) the action ( [ gaugeaction ] ) can be diagonalized in the momentum representation , @xmath64 which is the minimal coupling of the gauge fields to the fermions .    computing either the propagator or the fermion determinant , is crucial to directly measure chiral symmetry breaking . in the lattice , the green equation for the propagator , @xmath65",
    "is perfectly defined and can be solved numerically with the standard lattice methods @xcite . although @xmath39 is not the identity matrix , its nonvanishing matrix elements are very close to the diagonal .",
    "the fermion determinant @xmath66 is also calculable . as for the pure gauge term ,",
    "the wilson action is unchanged in this case .",
    "however the pole in the action , which was introduced to solve the doubler problem , raises a new difficulty @xcite when the gauge coupling is included .",
    "this can be understood when we extract pertubatively the coupling of the fermion to a gauge field from eq .",
    "( [ minimal ] ) .",
    "the same result can be extracted from the vector ward identity , and we get , @xmath67 now the pole in the fermion lagrangian ( [ final momentum ] ) will introduce a pole in the coupling say of a photon to an electron .",
    "hence the doublers , which were expelled from the free theory , reappear @xcite through the gauge independent interaction .",
    "this problem is common to the non - local actions , except for the bietenholz - wiese perfect action @xcite .",
    "we can address at the same token @xcite the coupling problem @xcite , and the ginsparg - wilson @xcite relation , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant of the order of the lattice spacing @xmath0 . in the case where the action complies with the ginsparg - wilson relation ,",
    "lscher @xcite showed that the lattice has redefined a chiral symmetry , which includes the chiral anomaly .",
    "moreover , in the continuum limit of @xmath70 , the chiral symmetry and chiral anomaly of conventional field theory could be recovered @xcite . here",
    "we will follow the chiu - zenkin @xcite prescription to solve the ginsparg - wilson relation , which has a linear version for the inverse dirac matrix , @xmath71 a solution of this equation is the sum of an homogeneous solution plus the particular one .",

    "we now return to the relevant chiral limit of @xmath87 , and compare the factorized action with the literature .",
    "the present action is formally very simple , and it is equivalent to the zenkin action .",
    "it is interesting to compare it with the neuberger action which is presently the most promising solution of the ginsparg - wilson relation .",

    "we have the single root . there",
    "the chiral breaking term vanishes and @xmath88 .",
    "the other interesting region is the whole boundary of the brillouin zone , where the chiral invariant term vanishes and @xmath89 .",
    "thus we have a whole surface where @xmath90 and this implies that the chiu - zenkin condition @xcite , @xmath91 is verified .",
    "this is a necessary condition @xcite for the topological @xcite index @xmath92 to be nonvanishing .",
    "the neuberger @xcite action @xmath93 has the same single root , and has @xmath94 points @xcite ( at the traditional position of the doublers ) where @xmath95 .",
    "it is also straightforward to study the locality of the action @xmath46 . in the literature we can find different definitions of a local action .",
    "nielsen and ninomiya called local an action with continuous first derivative in momentum space .",
    "the present action @xmath46 falls in this class .",
    "lscher is more restrictive @xcite , and calls local an action of class @xmath96 , in this class the interactions in position decrease at least exponentially with distance .",
    "the neuberger action belongs to this class .",
    "the present action does not , except for dimension @xmath97 , because at the usual position of the doubles its second derivatives do not exist . in @xmath98 dimensions we fourier",

    "[ logarithmic ] .",
    "we find that in the limit of large distances @xmath102 is approximately equal to @xmath103 , so the interactions decrease faster than a rational function .",
    "the finite range interactions , like the wilson action , are usually called ultralocal @xcite , but there are no solutions of the gisnparg - wilson relation with an ultralocal @xmath104 .",

    "thus it seems that the action @xmath93 is the best candidate to simulate continuum qcd , including the axial anomaly . because @xmath46 has apparently no chiral anomaly",
    ", it would be interesting to apply it to the study of chiral symmetry breaking on the lattice with a single flavor .    in continuum",
    "qcd the attiyah - singer index theorem is verified , but in the lattice this is still an open problem . according to niedermayer @xcite , this is scale dependent .",
    "if the topological object is larger than the scale of the action then the index theorem should be complied with , however if the topological object has a smaller scale , the index relation is not verified . in fig .",
    "[ logarithmic ] we see that a gauge configuration with finite topological should extend itself for more than 20 or 40 lattice spacings , in order to be larger than the scale of the interaction . in the case of @xmath93 , the scale of the fermionic matrix is just a few lattice spacings , an it was checked that @xmath93 complies with the index relation even in a small 6x6 lattice @xcite .",
    "so it would be interesting to use very large gauge topological objects to check if they would produce a finite index for the fermionic matrix @xmath46 .",
    "with the aim to simulate euclidian qcd , we find a lattice action where the extra roots corresponding to doubled fermions are factorized from the fermion propagator and from the fermion determinant . like the wilson fermion action @xcite , extra hopping terms",
    "are included in a initial action .",
    "the gauge invariant action with a conventional chiral symmetry has undesired poles in the coupling of a gauge boson to the fermion , but the action with the ginsparg - wilson - lscher @xcite symmetry does not suffer from the same pathology . the factorized fermionic action @xmath46 turns out to be equivalent to the zenkin @xcite action .",
    "this action complies with the ginsparg - wilson @xcite relation and with the chiu - zenkin @xcite criterium .",
    "however it is only weakly local and it has been checked that it is topologically trivial , at least in small lattices .",
    "the study of this action might help to understand the index relation on the lattice .",
    "we conclude that the interest in the present action is just theoretical because the neuberger action @xcite is a better candidate to the simulation of qcd on the lattice .",
    "i thank michael creutz , jean - franois lagae , jeffrey mandula and hugh shananan for introducing me to the lattice fermion problem during the 1996 como ii conference , and joo seixas and victor vieira from cfif for discussions on lattice techniques .",
    "i am indebted to michael creutz and to micha polikarpov for their remarks and suggestions .",
    "this paper was improved by the comment of wolfgang bietenholz who pointed out the problems and solutions of non - local lattice actions , and by the comment of ting - wai chiu who called my attention the action of sergei zenkin .",
    "the factorization of doubles can also be applied to different lattices , where the fermion and antifermion fields are placed in different sites . in these cases , unlike the solution in section ii , interpolations are unavoidable in the action , and we no longer have to comply with the nielsen and ninomiya theorem .",
    "it is possible to find actions without doubles and without the gauge coupling pathology .",
    "the gauge links are chosen to directly connect the antifermion sites with the nearest neighbor fermion sites , it is not necessary to concatenate a few links in order to reach a fermion from an antifermion .",
    "an example of a lattice where the same factorization procedure works is a alternate lattice where the @xmath1 and @xmath48 fields are placed at alternate sites .",
    "the link structure is simple , however the gauge lattice is @xmath107 bigger than the lattice of section iii .",
    "we will study in more detail another example , where the anti fermion fields @xmath54 are placed in the normal lattice and the fermion fields @xmath108 are placed in the dual lattice ( or vice versa ) . for @xmath109 , the lattice",
    "is composed by plaquettes with @xmath110 elementary links and the wilson pure gauge action can be used here .",
    "however the number of links per zone , the number of links which meet in a vertex and the link length differ from the case of section iii . in the case of section iii",
    "these numbers were respectively @xmath29 , @xmath111 , and @xmath0 , while in the present case these numbers are respectively @xmath107 , @xmath107 and @xmath112 . in the case of @xmath113 the number of links is now increased by a factor of @xmath110 and the number of links which meet at a vertex is now doubled .",
