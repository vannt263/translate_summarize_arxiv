    "the two detectors of the advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( aligo )  @xcite , located in hanford ( h1 ) , washington , and livingston ( l1 ) , louisiana , completed their first observation run `` o1 '' in january 2016 .",
    "it had begun in september 2015 , and lasted for about four months . a gravitational wave ( gw ) signal from the coalescence of two black holes , of about 30 @xmath2 each ,",
    "was observed by the two detectors on september 14 , 2015 , during the eighth engineering run , barely a few days before the commencement of o1 .",
    "this is not only the first direct detection of gws but also the observation of the heaviest stellar mass black holes to date and the first discovery of a binary black hole merger @xcite .",
    "a gw signal from a second binary black hole coalescence was detected by ligo on december 26 , 2015  @xcite , thereby , firmly launching a new era in astronomy .",
    "the detectors are yet to reach their peak sensitivity , which will be achieved in the next few years . that will lay the foundation for what should eventually become a ten - fold improvement in strain sensitivity and a thousand - fold improvement in the event rate , relative to initial ligo . in this way",
    ", aligo is expected to establish the era of gw astronomy with multiple observations .",
    "predictions of gw detection rates and estimation of source localization errors with aligo , especially associated with compact binary coalescences ( cbcs )  @xcite , are made based on a spectral profile for the detector noise , such as the ones given in fig .",
    "[ fig : noisepsds ] , and the assumption that the noise is gaussian and stationary . in reality",
    "it is neither of those two ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and can cause the predictions to come up short .",
    "this is why the sources of non - gaussianity and non - stationarity must be detected and eliminated ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this activity will be critical in ensuring good observational depth and thereby help toward realizing the expected rate of gw detections .",
    "as commissioners work on lowering the noise floor in order to approach that sensitivity , new types of broad and narrow band noise features will come to the fore that will require identification , analysis , modeling and eventual regression or mitigation .    as confirmed by the recent detections of gw events ,",
    "the most promising source of gws for ground - based interferometric detectors is the coalescence of the compact binary consisting of neutron stars and/or black holes .",
    "the attractiveness of cbcs stems from the fact that their signals are theoretically well modeled and their expected rates in the range of aligo are reasonably high  @xcite .",
    "one of the primary types of noise that adversely affects the sensitivity of searches for gws from cbcs is a transient burst that is either instrumental or environmental in origin and can be modeled as a sine - gaussian with a specific central frequency @xmath0 and quality factor @xmath1 , or a combination of sine - gaussians with different values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these frequencies and quality factors are ultimately related to the resonances and damping time - scales , respectively , of their sources .",
    "for the same reason they also show up on omega scans , which plots time - frequency maps of excess noise transients by resolving them in a sine - gaussian basis @xcite . to search large amounts of data using sine - gaussian basis , we use a reimplementation of the omega algorithm known as omicron .",
    "this is the main reason why we extensively study and compare the effect of sine - gaussian and related glitches on cbc searches here .",
    "is the noise power - spectral density .",
    ", width=336 ]    a theoretical framework was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the effect of a `` sine - gaussian '' strain on a non - spinning newtonian inspiral template . here",
    "we extend that work in the following ways .",
    "first , we study how a bank of thousands of non - spinning cbc templates responds to a sine - gaussian glitch injected into data sets when they are analysed by a search pipeline that was commissioned for aligo and advanced virgo ( adv ) searches  @xcite .",
    "this pipeline is called pycbc  @xcite and it uses matched filtering @xcite with theoretically modeled cbc templates to search for cbc signals . when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the matched - filter output is above a threshold value , the pipeline records the time of its occurrence and other related parameters , such as the cbc masses of the template , as a _",
    "trigger_. second , we repeat the above study for chirping sine - gaussians , which are similar to sine - gaussians except that the phase of the sine function now increases quadratically , instead of linearly , with time . these types of noise transients can be hazardous to an astrophysical search because they can produce high snr triggers if their frequency and the chirping rate match with those of the template , as we show below .",
    "third , we extend the theoretical framework that was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain a cbc template - bank s response to both kinds of glitches . in doing so",
    ", we qualitatively show how it can be used to discriminate between such glitches and real cbc signals .",
    "we argue that such discrimination can be made with negligible increase in computational costs , which is helpful in light of the fact that gw trigger alerts need to be communicated to electromagnetic and particle observatories for quick follow - ups for possible detection of prompt emissions and afterglows  @xcite .",
    "we also incorporate higher order post - newtonian ( pn ) terms in the template to discern their effects on the response .",
    "omicron automatically runs on multiple detector channels , including the gw channel , as data is acquired during an engineering or observation run , to identify noise glitches in them and archive them in a database .",
    "data quality scripts , such as the hierarchical veto @xcite , or `` h - veto '' run on these triggers to flag times in the gw data when its quality might be suspect , e.g. , due to influences from the environmental , instrumental or auxiliary channels .",
    "h - veto looks for coincidences of excess noise events ( such as the triggers produced by omicron ) in the gw channel with those in the latter channels .",
    "these flags are used by data analysis tools that search for astrophysical signals , e.g. , from cbcs  @xcite , to interpret the gw triggers arising from glitchy data - sets with greater care .",
    "our study on trigger time - lags and snrs will help computationally inexpensive tools like h - veto to set the time - windows for checking trigger coincidences in a more informed way .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sgbursts ] , we recapitulate the main results from the theoretical framework that was developed in ref .  @xcite . in the process , we introduce notation that we follow in the rest of the paper",
    ". additionally , we present results from an astrophysical search running on strain data and explain them in terms of the framework . in sec . [ sec : csgbursts ] , we present a similar study for chirping sine - gaussians , compare the results with non - chirping sine - gaussians , and analytically explain the reason behind the differences in the responses of the same cbc template bank to these two classes of glitches . in sec .

    "past experience with real data @xcite has shown that one of the types of noise artifacts that affects the background of the cbc searches is a temporally localized sinusoidal burst that can be characterized by a frequency , @xmath0 and a time - scale , which gives the duration of the rise and fall of its amplitude .",
    "( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . )",
    "there are multiple causes behind these transients , such as mechanical resonances , servo oscillations , etc .",
    "the time - scale of these transients is often alternatively described in terms of a quality factor @xmath1 , such that for a fixed @xmath0 large values of @xmath1 correspond to large durations of the noise transient .",
    "these two parameters also define a sine - gaussian function . indeed , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude and phase of the detector strain corresponding to such noise artifacts , or `` glitches '' , can be expanded in a basis of sine - gaussians , of varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the third parameter that characterizes these glitches is their time of occurrence .    in this section",
    "we extend the work initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite to study of the effect of sine - gaussian glitches in interferometric data on cbc searches",
    ". such burst like noise transients are frequently seen in spectrograms created by tools like omicron , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omicronspect ] . the loudest sine - gaussian component in this glitch was found to have @xmath3 hz and @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig : simsnrvstimelag4sgburst ] , which plots the snrs of the templates triggered by the glitch as a function of the time difference between the glitch and the end time of the trigger , time - lag . owing to the large snrs produced and the multiple templates triggered ,",
    "these glitches create multiple false - alarms and demand additional computation for identifying them and vetoing them .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to investigate and understand how these sine - gaussian glitches affect searches of cbc signals , even when the templates employed use only the inspiral phase , e.g. , in binary neutron star searches , which have insignificant power in the merger and ringdown part of the signal .",
    "a cbc search is performed over the binary parameter space by employing the matched filtering technique .",
    "this space comprises primarily two functions of the binary s component masses for cases where the components are non - spinning .",
    "the effect of a sine - gaussian glitch is seen in the matched filter output when it is matched filtered with a cbc template . since the binary parameters are not known _ a priori _ , a bank of multiple templates is used to adequately cover the required parameter space .",
    "we consider nonspinning newtonian amplitude waveforms . in this case",
    "the waveform depends only on a particular combination of individual masses of the binary - the chirp mass @xmath5 - in addition to other kinematical parameters .",
    "the sine - gaussian is characterized by its central frequency @xmath6 and decay time @xmath7 . instead of @xmath7",
    "we prefer the quality factor @xmath1 as a parameter in our analysis .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we had obtained the matched filter output as a function of time , denoted by @xmath8 , which is a complex function of the time - lag @xmath9 , between the signal and the template .",
    "the quantity we were interested in was the modulus of @xmath8 because then the maximization over the initial phase of the compact binary signal is automatically taken care of .",
    "then we had compared it with analytical approximations in various regions of the parameter space .",
    "here we are interested in the trigger generated by the matched filter - the maximum of @xmath10 - when it encounters a sine - gaussian glitch .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present analytical formulae for those characteristics of a trigger that can be used to discriminate the glitch from a cbc signal , namely , the snr and the time - lag .     hz and @xmath11 . ,",

    "we briefly review the main results of ref .",
