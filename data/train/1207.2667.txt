    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices have provided new opportunities to experimentally realise and study a wide range of complex quantum models under controllable conditions.@xcite many studies of atomic systems in artificial gauge potentials were motivated by the possibility to realize strongly correlated fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states.@xcite on the other hand , quantum hall effects @xcite have attracted much attention since their discovery , and are still a very active field of study .",
    "in addition to being intrinsically interesting systems , they are also being investigated from the point of view of topological quantum computing : excitations in some fqh systems exhibit fractional , anyonic statistics and can potentially perform fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "@xcite    an artificial gauge field for neutral atoms can be created , for example , by rotating the lattice.@xcite the rotation of the system is equivalent , in the corotating frame , to the introduction of an effective magnetic field proportional to the rotation frequency.@xcite however , the system enters the fqh regime at a very high rotation frequency or a low atomic density which are hard to achieve experimentally .",
    "this has motivated development of many alternative schemes @xcite to introduce a vector potential to a system of neutral atoms , for example , using raman assisted hopping combined with lattice acceleration or an inhomogeneous static electric field,@xcite or using oscillating quadrupole fields.@xcite    prior to studies of fqh states in optical lattices , such states have been predicted for rotating bose - einstein condensates in harmonic magnetic traps.@xcite the rotation ( effective magnetic field ) introduces vortices into the condensate and eventually , at sufficiently high rotation frequency , leads to formation of an abrikosov vortex lattice .",
    "@xcite when the number of vortices becomes comparable to the number of bosons the system can enter into a fqh state .",
    "however , since the interactions among the bosonic atoms in the magnetic traps are weak , the fqh ground state is separated from the excited states by a small energy gap . on the other hand , in optical lattices",
    "interaction energies among the atoms are much larger due to confinement of atoms in a smaller volume .",
    "this leads to more robust fqh states separated from the excited states by much larger energy gaps than for the atoms in harmonic traps .",
    "in addition , the presence of the lattice leads to new interesting physical effects .",
    "in particular , new fqh states with no counterpart in the continuum limit @xcite were predicted for systems of bosons in the presence of the lattice potential and effective magnetic field .    in the presence of a tight - binding lattice and a uniform magnetic field the single - particle energy levels change from simple landau levels in the absence of the lattice into the hofstadter butterfly spectrum.@xcite",
    "the energy spectrum depends on the magnetic flux @xmath1 per lattice plaquette ( measured in units of the flux quantum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the effective charge of the particle ) .    for rational @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 and @xmath6 coprime )",
    "the spectrum splits into @xmath6 bands and each state is @xmath6 fold degenerate .",
    "when the single - particle energies are plotted against the flux @xmath1 the resulting hofstadter butterfly has a fractal structure . for @xmath7 the low - lying bands",
    "become the landau levels of the continuum . for bosonic atoms with repulsive interactions , in the presence of a lattice and a uniform effective magnetic field with @xmath7 one thus expects to find the same states as in a continuum bosonic quantum hall system .",
    "some of the states that appear in the continuum are , for example , bosonic @xmath8 laughlin state and @xmath9 read - rezayi states @xcite with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the average particle density per lattice site .",
    "it has been shown that at sufficiently low particle density the lattice has a negligible effect on the nature of the continuum @xmath8 state.@xcite however , in the presence of the lattice additional novel fqh states with no counterpart in the continuum limit have also been predicted.@xcite    in the present paper we study incompressible ground states of interacting bosons in a two dimensional rotating square optical lattice .",
    "bosonic atoms in a deep optical lattice can be described by a bose - hubbard model .",
    "an effective vector potential , due to the lattice rotation , introduces an aharonov - bohm phase for the bosons hopping from site to site and the complex tunelling couplings appear in the hubbard hamiltonian . in the regime of strong on - site",
    "interaction the bose - hubbard hamiltonian can be mapped to an effective frustrated spin model . to study the spin model , we use schwinger boson mean field theory @xcite and projective symmetry group ( psg ) analysis.@xcite    schwinger boson mean - field theory allows description of both ordered and disordered phases , that is , the resulting mean field hamiltonian does not have any preferred direction in spin space .",
    "magnetic ordering is identified as bose - condensation of schwinger bosons . for such condensed phases",
    "the energy excitation spectrum is gapless , while a gapped spectrum corresponds to incompressible spin liquid phases . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the possible noncondensed ground states of the system , which do not break any symmetries . for such states ,",
    "psg anlysis can be used to determine different mean field anstze that reflect all the physical symmetries of the system and to classify possible spin liquid states .",
    "unlike conventional states which can be distinguished by patterns of broken symmetry , different spin liquid phases that are completely symmetric can be distinguished by considering how the symmetries are realized in those phases .",
    "such symmetric spin liquid phases can be classified using psg analysis .",
    "the main idea of the psg analysis of the mean field states in the schwinger boson theory is that the mean field ansatz preserves all the symmetries of the spin hamiltonian when it is invariant under transformations that are combined physical symmetry and @xmath12 gauge group transformations . in other words , symmetries of the spin model",
    "can be preserved in the mean field state in some indirect way and invariance of the mean field ansatz under all symmetry transformations is a sufficient , however not necessary condition .",
    "the set of all transformations that leave a mean field ansatz invariant is called the psg .",
    "different allowed sets of combined transformations can be found by considering algebraic relations among symmetry group elements .",
    "those different allowed sets of combined transformations then characterize physically distinct symmetric spin states .",
    "the bosonic fqh states of the system can then be identified with different spin liquid states of the effective spin model .",
    "in particular , our results show that lattice induced fqh states of the system correspond to `` @xmath0 flux '' spin liquid states of the effective spin model .",

    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider the system of bosonic atoms in a two - dimensional optical lattice and in the presence of an effective vector potential introduced , for example , through lattice rotation . in the limit of weak tunneling @xmath13 between wells within the lattice , compared to the level spacing in each well",
    ", the system can be described by a single - band bose - hubbard model on a square lattice with a complex hopping matrix element : @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are bosonic field operators on site @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the repulsive energy of two atoms in one well , @xmath20 is the chemical potential and @xmath21 denotes nearest - neighbor sites @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "the complex tunneling couplings appear in the hubbard hamiltonian due to the presence of the effective vector potential @xmath23 that introduces an aharonov - bohm phase for the boson hopping from site to site .",
    "when an atom moves from a lattice site at @xmath24 to a neighbouring site at @xmath25 , it will gain an aharonov - bohm phase : @xmath26 for a rotating lattice @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the rotation frequency and @xmath29 is the mass of the atom .",
    "we consider the case of the uniform magnetic field @xmath30 .",
    "the vector potential introduces frustration in the atomic motion if the phase twists around each plaquette add p to @xmath31 for some noninteger @xmath1 .",
    "the frustration parameter @xmath1 is defined as the flux per plaquette in units of @xmath32 : @xmath33 where the integration is over the surface of a lattice plaquette and the sum is performed anticlockwise over the edges of the square plaquette . due to the periodicity under @xmath34",
    "we can restrict the values of @xmath1 to @xmath35 .",
    "the frustration is maximal at @xmath36 .",
    "we choose the landau gauge @xmath37 so that the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath38 is zero on all horizontal bonds of the lattice , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "+ we further focus on the limit of weak tunneling compared to the repulsive energy @xmath19 for two atoms in one well , @xmath41 , where strong interparticle repulsion can lead to strongly correlated ground states .",
    "in such a limit the site occupation can be restricted to zero and one boson and the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq : bh ] ) can be mapped onto a spin-@xmath42 frustrated @xmath43 model .",
    "the two @xmath44 states of the pseudospin at a lattice site @xmath18 correspond to whether a lattice contains a boson or not .",
    "the strongly correlated phases of the system that we study in the present paper will correspond to spin - liquid phases of the effective frustrated quantum spin model .",
    "+ the mapping of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq : bh ] ) in the limit of @xmath41 to an effective spin hamiltonian is possible because hard - core boson operators have the same commutation relations as spin-@xmath42 operators .",
    "the operators on different sites commute and operators on the same site anticommute .",
    "the spin raising and lowering operators correspond to the creation and annihilation operators of hard - core bosons and the motion of the atoms translates to pseudospin exchange .",
    "the effective spin hamiltonian is : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 are spin-@xmath42 operators , and @xmath48 represents an effective zeeman field .",
    "note that this is a ferromagnet in the absence of frustration ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "also , it can be easily verified that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) has local gauge invariance .",
    "if we change the gauge , @xmath50 , then the hamiltonian stays unchanged if the boson and spin operators pick up a phase change , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the change of gauge corresponds to a spin rotation of @xmath54 in the @xmath55 plane .",
    "+ in the following sections we study spin liquid phases of the frustrated quantum spin model ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) using schwinger boson mean field theory and psg analysis . as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : fqh ] , those spin liquid phases correspond to fqh states of the system .",
    "schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) was first proposed by arovas and auerbach @xcite for su(2 ) invariant spin models and was further applied to frustrated antiferromagnets @xcite and generalized to anisotropic spin models.@xcite within the sbmft spin@xmath42 operators are represented in terms of the schwinger boson operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 as follows : @xmath58 in addition , the schwinger bosons satisfy the local constraint @xmath59 at every lattice site .    to derive a mean field theory that can describe both ordered and disordered phases , i.e. a mean field hamiltonian that does not have any preferred direction in spin space , the first step is to rewrite a spin hamiltonian in terms of bond operators which are bilinear forms in schwinger boson operators from nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "introduction of one complex hubbard - stratonovich field at each bond then provides a natural mean field decoupling scheme .",
    "there are usually many possible bond operators that one can define . however , the only relevant ones are the bond operators that are invariant under the transformations of the symmetry group of the hamiltonian .",
    "the spin hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) is invariant under spin rotations around the @xmath60-direction and has @xmath12 symmetry . in that case",
    "one can define four different bond operators that are invariant under symmetry operations of the hamiltonian : @xmath61 it can be easily verified that defined bond operators commute with the operator for the total magnetization in the @xmath60-direction , @xmath62 , and are thus @xmath12 symmetric .",
    "these bond operators are analogous to the bond operators defined for the quantum @xmath63 model @xcite with additional phase factors which reflect the presence of an effective vector potential .",
    "+ nonzero expectation values for these bond operators signal the presence of various short - range correlations , that is , indicate the presence of short - range order . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are analogous to @xmath66 ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bond operators , respectively .",
    "the bond operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent @xmath43 and easy axis correlations , respectively . depending on the expected dominant correlations in the ground state of a given hamiltonian",
    ", the hamiltonian is further rewritten in terms of the products of appropriate bond operators .",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) at @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a critical value of the effective zeeman field above which the system is in the mott insulating phase , the classical ground state has a finite total magnetization in the @xmath43 plane @xcite and the operators appropriate to describe the correlations in the ground state are @xmath64 and @xmath67 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) can then be rewritten in the following form : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of bosons at each lattice site and is constant , and @xmath73 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "this representation can then be generalized to @xmath74 schwinger boson flavors @xcite and the functional integral representation of the partition function can be systematically expanded in powers of @xmath75 .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian corresponds to a saddle point solution of the large @xmath74 action after hubbard stratonovich transformation .",
    "since here we are interested only in the mean field solution , we do not use the large @xmath74 language .",
    "we assume that the bond operators have nonzero expectation values : @xmath76 and perform a hartree  fock decomposition of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian is then : @xmath79 within the mean field theory the constraint on the schwinger boson occupation number at site @xmath18 is imposed on average : @xmath80 by introducing a chemical potential @xmath81 and the average boson number @xmath82 can also be taken as a parameter.@xcite mean field theory parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 are in general complex numbers called the mean field ansatz and can be found by solving self - consistent equations @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    within this method ,",
    "magnetic ordering in the @xmath43 plane is identified as bose condensation of the schwinger bosons . in the presence of the magnetic ordering the energy excitation spectrum of schwinger bosons is gapless , while a gapped excitation spectrum corresponds to incompressible spin liquid phases .",
    "further we will focus on the possible noncondensed ground states of the system which are expected to be states without any spontaneously broken symmetry . as explained in one of the following sections , for such states we can use projective symmetry group analysis ( psg ) to determine different mean field anstze that reflect all the physical symmetries of the system , and to classify possible spin liquid states that can appear in the phase diagram of the system .",
    "before proceeding to the psg analysis we define a group of operators that correspond to the symmetries of the system and which commute with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) .",
    "the presence of an effective vector potential reduces the physical symmetries of the lattice and the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) does not commute with the standard lattice spatial symmetry operations .",
    "however , it is still possible to define operators that correspond to physical symmetries of the system .",
    "as will be described below , such operators obey the same multiplication relations as the original lattice spatial symmetry operators apart from additional phase factors and commute with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) .",
    "generalized translation , rotation and reflection transformation operators in the presence of a uniform magnetic field can be specified and from such operators a full group can be constructed which is known as the magnetic symmetry group.@xcite    we define elementary translation ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) , rotation ( @xmath89 ) and reflection ( @xmath90 ) operators , illustrated in fig .",

    "the hamiltonian has periodicity @xmath6 in @xmath95 direction and @xmath98 .",
    "similarly one can define a unitary rotation operator giving rotation by @xmath99 counterclockwise around the origin : @xmath100 where the phase factor is again chosen to obtain @xmath101_{-}=0 $ ] . also , an antiunitary operator @xmath102 that corresponds to reflection in the line @xmath103 can be defined , @xmath104 which in combination with the antiunitary complex conjugation operator , @xmath105 , forms a unitary operator and is a symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 is a complex number , and @xmath109_{-}=0 $ ] .",
    "the reflection operator itself is not a symmetry of the hamiltonian since it reverses chirality while the magnetic field explicitly breaks chirality and time reversal symmetry .",
    "however , after combination with complex conjugation the appropriate sense of circulation is restored and operator @xmath110 denotes a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the magnetic symmetry group operators defined above have the same multiplication relations as ordinary spatial group operators apart from additional phase factors : @xmath111 we also note that using the schwinger boson representation of the spin operators ( [ eq : schwingerrepresentation ] ) , the magnetic symmetry group operators can also be defined in terms of their commutation relations with schwinger bosons as follows : @xmath112 where @xmath108 is a complex number , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which is a definition convenient for psg analysis . the equations ( [ eq : multiplicationrelations ] ) reflect the structure of the magnetic space group and will play a crucial role in determining possible mean field anstze using psg analysis as described in the following section .",
    "in this section we discuss possible spin liquid phases of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_mf ] ) .",
    "spin liquid states are spin disordered states that typically appear in frustrated spin models.@xcite to study and classify possible spin liquid phases we use a symmetry based analysis , psg analysis , originally introduced by wen and collaborators.@xcite within this theory we show that fqh states induced by a lattice potential,@xcite and with no counterpart in the continuum , correspond to `` @xmath0 flux '' spin liquid states of the effective frustrated spin model . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the connection between the spin liquid phases of the effective spin hamiltonian and fqh states for bosonic atoms in rotating optical lattices has not been previously investigated .    as we are interested in the phases of the system that do not break any symmetries , we require that the schwinger boson mean field theory reflects all the underlying microscopic symmetries of the spin model ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) .",
    "this will lead to symmetric spin liquid states .",
    "the symmetry transformations include magnetic symmetry group transformations and @xmath12 spin rotation symmetry .",
    "using psg analysis one can then construct all symmetry allowed mean field anstze .",
    "it is important , however , to note that the microscopic symmetries of the spin model can be preserved in the mean field state in some indirect way .",
    "as first noted by wen and collaborators @xcite in the context of fermionic mean field theory of spin liquids , the mean field theory ansatz should be invariant under transformations that are combined physical symmetry and gauge group transformations .",
    "this idea was then generalized to schwinger boson mean field theory for spin liquid states by wang and vishwanath.@xcite the transformations that leave the mean field ansatz invariant then form a group called projective symmetry group ( psg ) . to find psg transformations",
    "we first note that ( spin independent ) local @xmath12 gauge transformations of schwinger bosons @xmath117 leave the hamiltonian ( [ eq : easyplanemagnet ] ) and all physical observables unchanged .",
    "however , the mean field ansatz is not invariant with respect to transformations ( [ eq : gaugetransformation ] ) and transforms as follows : @xmath118 since the physical spin state should be gauge invariant we see that that two different mean field anstze that are related by a gauge transformation should , after implementing constraint ( [ eq : constarintaverage ] ) ( that is , after projection to the physical spin space ) lead to the same spin state . in other words , different mean field anstze may correspond to the same physical state and the underlying symmetries may not be explicitly present in the mean field ansatz .",
    "presence of the local @xmath12 gauge transformations then explains why invariance of the mean field ansatz with respect to all microscopic symmetries is not a necessary condition to obtain symmetric spin liquid states . if the transformed ( for example",
    "lattice translated ) mean field ansatz is equivalent to @xmath12 gauge transformed form of the ansatz the same spin state will be obtained after projection . accordingly , invariance with respect to combined physical symmetry and gauge transformations is a sufficient condition to obtain symmetric states .",
    "in addition to psg transformations that are related to physical symmetries , one finds that there are also some elements of psg that are pure local @xmath12 gauge transformations .",
    "these transformations are not the result of a physical symmetry and can be associated with the emergent gauge group that describes obtained spin liquid phase .",
    "such transformations form a subgroup of psg which is called invariant gauge group ( igg ) . the microscopic theory of the spin liquid states of the system involves schwinger boson spinons which are coupled to the emergent gauge field.@xcite when the spinon spectrum is gapped and the emergent gauge field takes discrete values @xcite ( @xmath119 spin liquid ) , or emergent gauge theory is @xmath12 gauge theory with a nontrivial topological term @xcite , the mean field solution is stable and is a good starting point for identifying possible spin liquid states .    to examine the stability of a mean field solution one has to consider the fluctuations in @xmath64 , @xmath67 and @xmath81 that descibe the collective excitations above the mean field state . @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath67 have the amplitude and phase fluctuations .",
    "the amplitude fluctuations have a finite energy gap and are not important in discussing the stability and low energy properties of the possible spin liquid phases .",
    "the phase fluctuations of the mean field ansatz are gapped in the presence of a chern - simons term or spinon - pair condensation ( anderson - higgs mechanism ) . here",
    "the latter is achieved if both @xmath64 and @xmath67 are nonzero and in that case the emergent gauge theory is @xmath119 ( ising ) gauge theory .",
    "if @xmath64 or @xmath67 is zero the emergent gauge theory is @xmath12 gauge theory .",
    "however , a chern - simons term present in the emergent gauge theory due to an effective uniform magnetic field gives the @xmath12 gauge boson a nonzero gap .",
    "gapped gauge bosons can mediate only short range interactions between spinons and stable spin liquid states always contain spinons with only short ranged interactions between spinons .",
    "+ further we will assume @xmath119 spin liquid states , that is , we will initially assume that both @xmath64 and @xmath67 are nonzero .",
    "it is then clear that the only two elements of the igg are the identity operation @xmath120 and the igg generator @xmath121 . in other words ,",

    "a psg transformation will be a combined transformation of magnetic symmetry group and gauge transformations .",

    "to further study noncondensed phases of the mean field hamiltonian we take into account the local constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) on schwinger boson number at each site exactly,@xcite unlike in the conventional schwinger boson mean field theory where the constraint is imposed on average as in the equation ( [ eq : constarintaverage ] ) . the local constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] )",
    "introduces strong correlations between spin - up and spin - down bosons .",
    "first we note that the constraint implies that the number of up / down bosons at each site can be only zero or one .",
    "thus we require that the schwinger boson operators satisfy the following anticommutation relations on the same site : @xmath168 where @xmath169 , and commutation relations @xmath170_-=0 \\;,\\ ; \\left[a_{i,\\sigma } , a_{j,\\sigma'}^\\dagger\\right]_-=0,\\ ] ] for the lattice sites @xmath18 and @xmath22 when @xmath171 .",
    "the requirement above corresponds to a hard - core limit for each bosonic species and excludes states with more than one boson of the same species at the same lattice site .",
    "however , to take the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) into account exactly we also need to exclude the states with one spin - up and one spin - down schwinger boson at the same lattice site .",
    "this is achieved by the gutzwiller projection : @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the number operators at a site @xmath18 for spin - up and spin - down schwinger bosons respectively , which for hard - core bosons have eigenvalues @xmath175 or @xmath120 .",
    "the ground state wave function is then @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the mean field hamiltonian ground state wave function . to apply the gutzwiller projection",
    "explicitly it is convenient to rewrite the mean field hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_mf ] ) in the following form :    @xmath178    where @xmath179 with @xmath180 being the number of lattice sites , and where we have introduced the notation @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "we have also taken into account that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are real for all mean field anstze ( [ eq : mfansatz2 ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath183 creates a spin - up bosonic hole and the operator @xmath184 creates a spin - down bosonic particle at the site @xmath18 .",
    "the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) can then be rewritten in the form : @xmath185 where we have used the anticommutation relations ( [ eq : anticommutationrelations ] ) .",
    "the local constraint ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) is equivalent to saying that wherever there is a spin - down boson there is also a spin - up hole .",
    "the gutzwiller projected wave function with @xmath186 spin - down bosons and @xmath187 spin - up bosons can then be obtained in the following way . starting from the state with @xmath74 spin - up bosons ,",
    "first @xmath186 spin - up bosons are annihilated and then @xmath186 spin - down bosons created at the coordinates of the spin - up holes . therefore the wave function in the coordinate representation will be a function of the coordinates of spin - down bosons ( or equivalently of spin - up bosonic holes ) only .    before examining further the effect of the gutzwiller projection we note that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : mfhamiltonian2 ] ) describes correlated hopping of particle - hole pairs .",
    "we are thus led to introduce the following hard core boson operators : @xmath188 it can be easily verified that these operators satisfy mixed commutation - anticommutation relations of the form ( [ eq : anticommutationrelations ] ) and ( [ eq : commutationrelations ] ) . in terms of operators ( [ eq : plusminusoperators ] )",
    "the mean field hamiltonian ( [ eq : mfhamiltonian2 ] ) can be written as : @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "also , the constraint ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) implies the following condition : @xmath191 this can be seen from the equation @xmath192 .",
    "when the constraint ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) is taken into account explicitly then the only allowed states are the states with zero or one particle - hole pairs at a lattice site . within this",
    "restricted single site basis terms @xmath193 and @xmath194 can be set to zero and condition ( [ eq : constraint3 ] ) is obtained .",
    "+ the ground state wave function can then be obtained through the following projection : @xmath195 where @xmath196 represents the vacuum of spin - down bosons and spin - up holes , ( or equivalently vacuum of @xmath197 and @xmath198 bosons ) , @xmath24 are coordinates of @xmath74 bosonic atoms in the lattice , and @xmath199 is a mean field state of bosons @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "+ the effective flux per plaquette of the lattice for @xmath200 bosons is @xmath201 , with @xmath202 being the effective flux for the atoms . for the mean field anstze @xmath154 and @xmath155 the effective flux @xmath203 , and for the mean field anztze @xmath105 and @xmath156 @xmath204 .",
    "since the number of atoms is the same as the number of @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) bosons and @xmath201 the wavefunction can be written as : @xmath205 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath206 is the wavefunction for @xmath197/@xmath198 bosons at filling fractions @xmath207 , with @xmath208/@xmath209 being the average density of @xmath197/@xmath198 bosons per lattice site .",
    "thus at an atom filling fraction @xmath210 , the average density of atoms per lattice site is @xmath211 for the mean field anstze @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and @xmath212 for the mean field anstze @xmath105 and @xmath156 , where we have taken into account the symmetries under @xmath213 and @xmath214 ( particle - hole symmetry on the lattice ) .",
    "+ we further argue that the fqh states of bosonic atoms in a rotating optical lattice correspond to the incompressible states for @xmath215 pairs . without the constraint ,",
    "two species of hard - core bosons , @xmath216 and @xmath217 , are independent of each other and the ground state wavefunction of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ eq : mfhamiltonian3 ] ) can be written as a product of the ground state wavefunctions for @xmath216 and @xmath217 bosons .",
    "for example , at an effective filling fraction @xmath218 the ground state for each bosonic species ( @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) is predicted to be an incompressible state that , in the continuum limit , can be described by the bosonic pfaffian state.@xcite the projected wavefunction ( [ eq : wavefunction3 ] ) then corresponds to the @xmath219 fqh states for @xmath215 pairs ( or equivalently for particle - hole pairs ) .",
    "+ at @xmath218 , that is @xmath219 , possible incompressible ground states are at @xmath220 ( mean field anstze @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) and @xmath221 ( mean field anstze @xmath105 and @xmath156 ) .",
    "the states with @xmath221 are lattice induced fqh states , with no counterpart in the continuum , and within presented mean field theory , correspond to `` @xmath0 flux '' spin liquid states of the effective spin model ( mean field anstze @xmath105 and @xmath156 ) for which the hard - core bosons @xmath216 and @xmath217 see an effective flux @xmath222 .",
    "such incompressible quantum hall states have previously been found using the composite fermion approach and exact diagonalization studies.@xcite several other lattice induced incompressible states predicted within the composite fermion approach can also be related to incompressible states for @xmath223 pairs , for example states at @xmath224 .",
    "+ finally , we note that the projected wavefunctions are also classified by psg and that our results provide a guideline for a further search of possible ground states in the projected wavefunction space .",
    "we thus propose to study the effective spin model by gutzwiller projected wavefunction variational approach @xcite as a possible direction of future research .",
    "we have studied possible incompressible ground states for bosonic atoms in a rotating square optical lattice . in the hard - core boson limit",
    "the bose - hubbard hamiltonian for the system can be mapped to a frustrated easy - plane magnet . using schwinger boson mean field theory and projective symmetry group analysis we have classified possible stable gapped spin liquid states of the effective spin model and related those states to fqh states for bosonic atoms in rotating optical lattices . in particular , we have found that , within the mean field theory developed here , the fqh states induced by lattice potential and with no counterpart in the continuum limit , correspond to `` @xmath0 flux '' spin liquid states of the effective spin model . since there are also competing condensed states on the lattice @xcite it is important to test the predictions of the mean field theory presented here . finally , further work is necessary for more direct comparison of the obtained results with known results for fqh states in rotating optical lattices .",
    "we hope the gutzwiller projected wavefunction variational approach will be further developed in future research .",
