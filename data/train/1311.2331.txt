    "in applications like wireless communications , audio signal processing , radar and microphone array processing , adaptive beamforming has been intensively researched and developed in the past years . however , under certain circumstances , adaptive beamformers suffer a performance degradation due to several reasons which include short data records , the presence of the desired signal in the training data , or imprecise knowledge of the steering vector of the desired signal . in order to improve the performance of adaptive beamformers in the presence of steering vector mismatches ,",
    "rab techniques have been developed .",
    "different from the standard designs @xcite , the design principles of rab mvdr beamformers @xcite include : the generalized sidelobe canceller , diagonal loading @xcite , subspace projection @xcite , worst - case optimization @xcite and steering vector estimation with presumed prior knowledge @xcite .",
    "however , rab designs based on these principles have some drawbacks such as their ad hoc nature , high probability of subspace swap at low snr and high computational cost @xcite .",
    "some recent design approaches have considered combining different design principles together to improve rab performances .",
    "the algorithm which jointly estimates the mismatched steering vector using sequential quadratic program ( sqp ) @xcite and the interference - plus - noise covariance ( inc ) matrix using a shrinkage method @xcite has been reported recently .",
    "later , another similar approach which jointly estimates the steering vector using sqp and the inc matrix using a covariance reconstruction method @xcite , presents outstanding performance compared to other rab techniques . however , the cost of the algorithm in @xcite is high due to the required matrix reconstruction process .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an rab algorithm with low complexity , which requires very little in terms of prior information , and has a superior performance to previously reported rab algorithms .",
    "the proposed technique estimates the steering vector using a low - complexity shrinkage - based mismatch estimation ( locsme ) algorithm .",
    "locsme estimates the covariance matrix of the input data and the inc matrix using the oracle approximating shrinkage ( oas ) method .",
    "the only prior knowledge that locsme requires is the angular sector in which the desired signal steering vector lies .",
    "given the sector , the subspace projection matrix of this sector can be computed in very simple steps @xcite . in the first step , an extension of the oas method @xcite",
    "is employed to perform shrinkage estimation for both the cross - correlation vector between the received data and the beamformer output and the received data covariance matrix .",
    "locsme is then used to estimate the mismatched steering vector and does not involve any optimization program , which results in a lower computational complexity . in a further step , we estimate the desired signal power using the desired signal steering vector and the received data . as the last step , a strategy which subtracts the covariance matrix of the desired signal from the data covariance matrix estimated by oas",
    "is proposed to obtain the inc matrix .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it circumvents the use of direction finding techniques for the interferers , which are required to obtain the inc matrix .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the system model is described in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "the proposed locsme algorithm is presented .",
    "section iv shows and discusses the simulation results .",
    "finally , section v gives the conclusion .",
    "consider a linear antenna array of @xmath0 sensors and @xmath1 narrowband signals received at @xmath2th snapshot as expressed by @xmath3 where @xmath4 presents the uncorrelated source signals , @xmath5^t \\in { \\mathbb r}^k$ ] is the vector containing the directions of arrivals ( doas ) , @xmath6 \\in { \\mathbb c}^{m \\times k}$ ] is the matrix which contains the steering vector for each doa and @xmath7 is the mismatch of the steering vector of the desired signal , @xmath8 is assumed to be complex gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath9 .",
    "the beamformer output is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11^t \\in { \\mathbb c}^{m\\times1}$ ] is the beamformer weight vector , where @xmath12 denotes the hermitian transpose .",
    "the optimum beamformer can be computed by maximizing the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) given by @xmath13 assume that the steering vector @xmath14 is known precisely ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the desired signal power and @xmath17 is the inc matrix , then problem ( 3 ) can be transformed into an optimization problem @xmath18 which is known as the mvdr beamformer or capon beamformer @xcite .",
    "the optimum weight vector is given by @xmath19 since @xmath17 is usually unknown in practice , it is estimated by the sample covariance matrix ( scm ) of the received data as @xmath20 which will result in the sample matrix inversion ( smi ) beamformer @xmath21 .",
    "however , the smi beamformer requires a large number of snapshots and is sensitive to steering vector mismatches @xcite .",
    "in this section , the proposed locsme algorithm is introduced .",
    "the idea of locsme is to estimate the steering vector and the inc matrix separately as in previous approaches .",
    "the estimation of the steering vector is described as the projection onto a predefined subspace matrix of an iteratively shrinkage - estimated cross - correlation vector between the beamformer output and the array observation .",
    "the inc matrix is obtained by subtracting the desired signal covariance matrix from the data covariance matrix estimated by the oas method .",
    "the cross - correlation between the array observation vector and the beamformer output can be expressed as @xmath22 we assume that @xmath23 for @xmath24 , all signal sources and the noise have zero mean , and the desired signal and every interferer are independent from each other . by substituting ( 1 ) and",
    "( 2 ) into ( 6 ) , we suppose the interferers are sufficiently canceled such that they fall much below the noise floor and the desired signal power is not affected by the interference so that @xmath25 can be rewritten as @xmath26 in order to eliminate the unwanted part of @xmath25 and obtain an estimate of the steering vector @xmath27 , @xmath25 can be projected onto a subspace @xcite that collects information about the desired signal . here",
    "the prior knowledge amounts to providing an angular sector range in which the desired signal is located , say @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the subspace projection matrix @xmath29 is given by @xmath30[{\\bf c}_1,{\\bf c}_2,\\dotsb,{\\bf c}_p]^h,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the @xmath32 principal eigenvectors vectors of the matrix @xmath33 , which is defined by @xcite @xmath34 at this point , locsme will use the oas method to compute the correlation vector @xmath25 iteratively .",
    "the aim is to devise a method that estimates @xmath25 more accurately with the help of the shrinkage technique .",
    "an accurate estimate of @xmath25 can help to obtain a better estimate of the steering vector .",
    "let us define @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then , a reasonable tradeoff between covariance reduction and bias increase can be achieved by shrinkage of @xmath38 towards @xmath39 @xcite and subsequently using it in a vector shrinkage form , which results in @xmath40 which is parameterized by the shrinkage coefficient @xmath41 .",
    "if we define @xmath42 then the goal is to find the optimal value of @xmath41 that minimizes the mean square error ( mse ) of @xmath43 $ ] in the @xmath2th snapshot , which leads to @xmath44 @xmath45 where the derivation is shown in the appendix and @xmath46 is the sample correlation vector ( scv ) given by @xmath47 as long as the initial value of @xmath48 is between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the iterative process in ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) is guaranteed to converge @xcite .",
    "once the correlation vector @xmath51 is obtained by the above oas method , the steering vector is estimated by @xmath52 where @xmath53 gives the final estimate of the steering vector .      in order to estimate the inc matrix , the data covariance matrix ( which contains the desired signal )",
    "is required .",
    "the scm in ( 5 ) is necessary as a preliminary approximation . in the next step ,",
    "similar to using oas to estimate the cross - correlation vector @xmath51 , the scm is also processed with the oas method as a further shrinkage estimation step .",
    "let us define the following quantity @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "then , we use the shrinkage form again @xmath56 by minimizing the mse described by @xmath57 $ ] , we obtain the following recursion @xmath58 @xmath59 provided that @xmath60 , the iterative process in ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) is guaranteed to converge @xcite . in order to eliminate the unwanted information of the desired signal in the covariance matrix and obtain the inc matrix , the desired signal power @xmath16 must be estimated .",
    "let us rewrite the received data as @xmath61 pre - multiplying the above equation by @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 assuming that @xmath27 is uncorrelated with the interferers , we obtain @xmath64 taking the expectation of @xmath65 $ ] , we obtain @xmath66.\\ ] ] if the noise is statistically independent of the desired signal , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the desired signal power which can be replaced by its estimate @xmath69 , @xmath70 represents the noise covariance matrix @xmath71 which can be replaced by @xmath72 . replacing @xmath27 by its estimate @xmath73 the desired signal power estimate",
    "is given by @xmath74 as the last step , the desired signal covariance matrix is subtracted and the inc matrix is given by @xmath75 the advantage of this step compared to smi and existing methods is that it does not require direction finding and is suitable for real - time applications . with the estimates for the steering vector and the inc matrix ,",
    "the beamformer is computed by @xmath76 table i summarizes locsme in steps . from a complexity point of view , the main computational cost is due to the following steps : scm of the observation data , oas estimation for scm , norm computations of the covariance matrix and the inc matrix .",
    "each of these steps has a complexity of @xmath77 .",
    "additionally , compared to the previous rab algorithms in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which have complexity equal or higher than @xmath78 , locsme has a lower cost ( @xmath77 ) .",
    ".proposed locsme algorithm [ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "in our simulations , a uniform linear array ( ula ) of @xmath79 omnidirectional sensors with a spacing of half wavelength is considered .",
    "three source signals include the desired signal which is presumed to arrive at @xmath80 and two interferers which are impinging on the antenna array from directions @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) is fixed at 20db .",
    "only one iteration is performed per snapshot and we employ @xmath83 snapshots and 100 repetitions to obtain each point of the curves . the beamformer computed with locsme is compared to existing beamformers in terms of the output sinr . for the beamformers of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the beamformer with locsme , the angular sector is chosen as @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 principal eigenvectors are used . the number of eigenvectors of the subspace projection matrix @xmath32 is selected manually with the help of simulations . for the beamformers of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which also require an optimization technique , the cvx software is used .",
    "the sinr performance versus snapshots and snr of the algorithms is shown in figs . 1 and 2 and the number of snapshots is @xmath86 for the sinr versus snr plots .",
    "the average execution time of the algorithms in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite is around @xmath87 sec / snapshot , while locsme only requires @xmath88 sec / snapshot .      in this case , the steering vector of the desired signal is affected by a local scattering effect and modeled as @xmath89 where @xmath90 corresponds to the direct path while @xmath91 corresponds to the scattered paths .",
    "the angles @xmath92 are randomly and independently drawn in each simulation run from a uniform generator with mean @xmath93 and standard deviation @xmath94 .",
    "the angles @xmath95 are independently and uniformly taken from the interval @xmath96 $ ] in each simulation run .",
    "notice that @xmath97 and @xmath98 change from trials while remaining constant over snapshots @xcite . figs . 1 ( a ) and 2 ( a ) illustrate the sinr performance versus snapshots and snr under the coherent scattering case .",
    "locsme outperforms the other algorithms and is close to the optimum sinr .      in the incoherent local scattering case ,",
    "the desired signal has a time - varying signature and the steering vector is modeled by @xmath99 where @xmath100 are i.i.d zero mean complex gaussian random variables independently drawn from a random generator . the angles @xmath101 are drawn independently in each simulation run from a uniform generator with mean @xmath93 and standard deviation @xmath94 .",
    "this time , @xmath102 changes both from run to run and from snapshot to snapshot . figs . 1 ( b ) and 2 ( b ) depict the sinr performance versus snapshots and snr .",
    "compared to the coherent scattering results , all the algorithms have a performance degradation due to the effect of incoherent local scattering . however , locsme is able to outperform the remaining robust beamformers over a wide range of input snr .",
    "the reason for the improved performance of locsme is the combined use of accurate estimates of the inc matrix and of the steering vector mismatch .",
    "further testing with a larger number of antenna array elements indicates that the performance of all algorithms degrades ( e.g. locsme has around 2db degradation when @xmath103 ) .",
    "in addition , inappropriate choice for the angular sector in which the desired signal is assumed to be located will lead to obvious performance degradation .",
    "# 1#20.875    # 1#20.875",
    "we have proposed locsme that only requires prior knowledge of the angular sector of the desired signal and is less costly than existing methods .",
    "simulation results have shown that locsme outperforms prior art in both coherent local scattering and incoherent local scattering cases .",
    "_ derivation of @xmath104 _ : equation ( 12 ) can be rewritten in an alternative way in matrix version as @xmath105 . by using ( 10 ) ,",
