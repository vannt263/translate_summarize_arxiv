    "the majority of the spin-1 three - dimensional transition - metal compounds that we know of , fall into one or both of the following categories : materials with relatively high magnetic ordering temperatures and pretty far from a true strong - coupling heisenberg limit , or quantum magnets where long - range order is suppressed by sizable geometrical frustration .",

    "are in order : even if dft+dmft is well known for giving accurate results for three - dimensional transition - metal oxides , the quantitative corrections due to spatial fluctuations are still sizeable in 3d .",
    "the reduction of @xmath106 is one of the most evident of these corrections . indeed , even if not as dramatic as in 2d , where the single - site dmft @xmath106 is finite instead of zero as predicted by the mermin - wagner theorem , this reduction has been quantified by means of a diagrammatic extensions of dmft to be @xmath1930% in the intermediate - to - strong coupling regime @xcite .    in our specific case",
    ", we can also rely on random - phase calculations and on spin - wave theory to evaluate the effect of non - local correlations . for our value of the @xmath110 ratio",

    "the most plausible reason for an additional reduction of the theoretical @xmath106 is the presence of a few percents of ni - ti anti - site disorder , as reported in ref . .",
    "before switching to the thermodynamics of the magnetic transition , let us also comment on the dashed line in fig .",

    "la@xmath0nitio@xmath1 being its first member  that , due to the dramatic reduction of the bandwidth can be very interesting for oxide engineering .",

    "<S> the double perovskite la@xmath0nitio@xmath1 is identified as a three - dimensional @xmath2=1 quantum magnet . by means of density functional theory we demonstrate that this material is a high - spin @xmath3-electron system deep in the heisenberg limit and establish that its paramagnetic mott phase persists down to low temperatures ( experimental nel temperature @xmath4k ) not because of frustration effects but rather for strong local fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> our many - body calculations on an _ ab initio_-derived multi - orbital basis predict indeed a kinetic energy gain when entering the magnetically ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> la@xmath0nitio@xmath1 emerges thus as a paradigmatic realization of a hund s coupling - driven mott insulator . </S>",
