    "this paper investigates a mapping class group action on a certain poisson algebra and on the representation spaces of the associated quantum algebra . this poisson algebra , in the following referred to as flower algebra , plays an important role in the combinatorial description of the phase space of chern - simons theory with semidirect product gauge groups of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a lie group , @xmath6 the dual of its lie algebra and @xmath3 acts on @xmath6 in the coadjoint representation .",
    "its classical structure and quantisation were studied in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "although mapping class groups and chern - simons gauge theories are research topics in their own right , our interest in them is motivated by their relevance to physics .",
    "chern - simons gauge theory with gauge group @xmath2 occurs in the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with vanishing cosmological constant @xcite , where , depending on the signature of the spacetime , the gauge group is the three dimensional poincar or euclidean group . for",
    "spacetimes of topology @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an oriented surface of arbitrary genus , possibly with punctures and boundary components , large diffeomorphisms of the surface @xmath8 give rise to poisson symmetries or canonical transformations on the phase space @xcite .",
    "there is evidence suggesting that these symmetries play an important role in the physical interpretation of the theory , in particular for the dynamics of gravitationally interacting particles @xcite .",

    "the moduli space is given as a quotient of the space of holonomies associated to a set of @xmath10 generators of the surface s fundamental group equipped with a certain poisson structure . in our case , these holonomies are elements of @xmath2 , and one obtains a poisson structure on the manifold @xmath11 .",

    "we prove that the mapping class group action on the flower algebra is a poisson action and show that the action of dehn twists around embedded curves on the surface @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of a @xmath3-action that is infinitesimally generated via the poisson bracket .",
    "for the case where the exponential map @xmath15 is surjective , we give explicit hamiltonians whose flow by one unit is equal to the action of dehn twists .",
    "these flows are special examples of the hamiltonian `` twist flows '' studied by goldman in @xcite , but the particular hamiltonians we consider and their relation with dehn twists appear to be new .",

    "we show that elements of the mapping class group act as algebra automorphisms on the quantised flower algebra and implement this action on its representation spaces .",
    "this allows us to relate the quantum action of the mapping class group to different representations of the quantum double @xmath4 of the group @xmath3 .",
    "we find a canonical way of associating a representation of the quantum double @xmath4 to each embedded curve , such that the action of the corresponding dehn twist is given by the ribbon element of @xmath4 .",
