    "the fundamental problem of cp - violation in the lepton sector is one of the most challenging future frontiers in the studies of neutrino mixing .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that in the case of a _ large mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem _ , the observation of -decay combined with data on the neutrino masses from @xmath2 @xmath3-decay experiments could provide , in principle , unique information on the cp - violation due to the majorana cp - violating phases . as a more detailed study showed @xcite , information on the cp - violation of interest , and",

    "however , such a measurement can not rule out without additional input that the two phases take different cp - conserving values .",
    "the additional input needed for establishing cp - violation could be , e.g. , the measurement of neutrino mass @xmath93 in @xmath2 @xmath3-decay experiment katrin @xcite , or the cosmological determination of the sum of the three neutrino masses @xcite , @xmath96 , or a derivation of a sufficiently stringent upper limit on @xmath1 ( or @xmath97 ) .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that the possibility of finding cp - violation `` requires quite accurate measurements '' of and , say , of @xmath93 , `` and holds only for a limited range of values of the relevant parameters '' .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to quantify these requirements , and to better determine the ranges of values of the parameters in question , which could allow to detect cp - violation due to the majorana cp - violating phases .",
    "we discuss also the requirement the possibility of establishing cp - violation imposes on the uncertainty in the values of the -decay nuclear matrix elements .",
    "let us add that at present no viable alternative to the measurement of for getting information about the majorana cp - violating phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 exists ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or can be foreseen to exist in the next @xmath98 years .",
    "the problem of detecting cp - violation associated with majorana neutrinos by measuring @xmath85 and @xmath93 ( or @xmath97 ) was discussed recently also in ref .",
    "the authors of @xcite , after making a certain number of assumptions about the experimental and theoretical developments in the field of interest that might occur by 2020 , claim to have shown `` once and for all that it is impossible to detect cp - violation from -decay in the foreseeable future .

    "we have strong doubts that it is possible to foresee with certainty all the scientific and technological developments relevant to the problem of interest , which will take place in the next @xmath99 years .",
    "correspondingly , the approach we follow in the present work is `` orthogonal '' to that adopted in @xcite : here we make an attempt to determine the conditions under which cp - violation might be detected from a measurement of and @xmath93 ( or @xmath97 ) , or of and a sufficiently stringent upper limit on @xmath1 or @xmath97 .",

    "<S> proving that the indicated cp - violation takes place requires , in particular , a relative experimental error on the measured value of not bigger than 20% , a `` theoretical uncertainty '' in the value of due to an imprecise knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements smaller than a factor of 2 , a value of @xmath4 , and values of the relevant majorana cp - violating phases typically within the intervals of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    </S>",
