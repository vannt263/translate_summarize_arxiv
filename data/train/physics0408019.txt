    "@xcite , and in 1994 by schllkopf and toennies @xcite . in the latter investigation",
    "the existence of helium trimers has also been demonstrated .",
    "later on , grisenti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured a bond length of @xmath2  for @xmath0he@xmath1 , which indicates that this dimer is the largest known diatomic molecular ground state .",
    "based on this measurement they estimated a scattering length of @xmath3  and a dimer energy of @xmath4 mk @xcite .",
    "further investigations concerning helium trimers and tetramers have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , but with no results on size and binding energies .",
    "many theoretical calculations of these systems were performed for various interatomic potentials @xcite .",
    "variational , hyperspherical and faddeev - type techniques have been employed in this context ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) . for the potentials given in @xcite it turned out that the helium trimer has two bound states of total angular momentum zero : a ground state of about @xmath5 mk and an excited state of about @xmath6 mk .",
    "the latter was shown to be of efimov nature  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated in  @xcite how the efimov states emerge from the virtual ones when decreasing the strength of the interaction .",
    "high accuracy has been achieved in all these calculations .    while the number of papers devoted to the @xmath0he@xmath7 bound - state problem is rather large , the number of scattering results is still very limited .",
    "phase shifts of @xmath0he@xmath0he@xmath1 elastic scattering at ultra - low energies have been calculated for the first time in @xcite below and above the three - body threshold .",
    "an extension and numerical improvement of these calculations was published in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only alternative _ ab initio _ calculation of phase shifts below the three - body threshold was performed in @xcite . as shown in @xcite , a zero - range model formulated in field theoretical terms",
    "is able to simulate the scattering situation .",
    "though being an ideal quantum mechanical problem , involving three neutral bosons without complications due to spin , isospin or coulomb forces , the exact treatment of the @xmath0he triatomic system is numerically quite demanding at the scattering threshold . due to the low energy of the helium dimer , a very large domain in configuration space , with a characteristic size of hundreds of ngstroems ,",
    "has to be considered . as a consequence ,",
    "the accuracy achieved in @xcite for the scattering length appeared somewhat limited . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we have enlarged in the present investigation the cut - off radius @xmath8 from 600 to 900  and employed much more refined grids .",
    "besides the complications related to the large domain in configuration space , the other source of complications is the strong repulsion of the he  he interaction at short distances .",
    "this problem , however , was and is overcome in our previous and present investigations by employing the rigorous hard - core version of the faddeev differential equations developed in @xcite .",
    "let us recall the main aspects of the corresponding formalism ( for details see @xcite ) . in what follows we restrict ourselves to a total angular momentum @xmath9",

    "@xcite .    the functions @xmath23 satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath24 moreover , in the hard - core model they are required to satisfy the condition @xmath25 this guarantees the wave function @xmath26 to be zero not only at the core boundary @xmath27 but also inside the core domains .",

    "we use a finite - difference approximation of the boundary - value problem ( [ fadpart])([asbcparts ] ) in the polar coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the grids are chosen such that the points of intersection of the arcs @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the rays @xmath50 , @xmath51 with the core boundary @xmath27 constitute the knots .",
    "the value of the core radius is chosen to be @xmath52 by the argument given in @xcite .",
    "we also follow the same method for choosing the grid radii @xmath53 ( and , thus , the grid hyperangles @xmath54 ) as described in @xcite .",
    "our calculations are based on the semi - empirical hfd - b @xcite and lm2m2 @xcite potentials by aziz and co - workers , and the more recent , purely theoretically derived tty @xcite potential by tang , toennies and yiu . for the explicit form of these polarization potentials we refer to the appendix of ref .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      unlike the trimer binding energies , the @xmath0he@xmath0he@xmath1 scattering length is much more sensitive to the grid parameters . to investigate this sensitivity",

    "inspection of this figure shows that , when increasing the dimension @xmath62 of the grid , convergence of the @xmath0he@xmath0he@xmath1 scattering length @xmath42 is essentially achieved , however , with different limiting values of @xmath42 for different choices of @xmath8 .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the transition from @xmath65  to @xmath66  , while the transition to @xmath67  or even @xmath68  has practically no effect .    bearing this in mind , we feel justified to choose @xmath66  when going over from @xmath69 to @xmath70 and 4 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in table [ tablesclength ] .",
    "there we also show our previous results @xcite where , due to lack of computer facilities , we had to restrict ourselves to @xmath71  and @xmath72 .",
    "we see that an improvement of about 10% is achieved in the present calculations , as indicated already by the trends in fig .",
    "[ fig - ttylen ] .",
    "table [ tablesclength ] also contains the fairly recent results by blume and greene @xcite and roudnev @xcite .",
    "the treatment of @xcite is based on a combination of the monte carlo method and the hyperspherical adiabatic approach .",
    "the one of ref .",
    "@xcite employs the three - dimensional faddeev differential equations in the total angular momentum representation .",
    "our results agree rather well with these alternative calculations .",
    "this gives already a good hint on the quality of our present investigations .",
    "a direct confirmation is obtained by extrapolating the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - ttylen ] . according to this figure ,",
    "convergence of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath62 is essentially , but not fully , achieved . a certain improvement ,",
    "thus , is still to be expected when going to higher @xmath62 . in order to estimate this effect we approximate the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig - ttylen ] by a function of the form @xmath73 clearly , @xmath74 .",
    "the constants @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are fixed by the values of @xmath42 at @xmath78 , 2005 , and @xmath79 . in this way",
    "we get the corresponding optimal scattering lengths @xmath80 , 156.4 , 155.4 , and 154.8  for @xmath65 , 700 , 800 , and 900  , respectively . comparing with table [ ttylen_conv ]",
    "shows that the differences between these asymptotic values and the ones for @xmath81 lie between 1 to 3  .    for @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath66  and the lm2m2 potential the scattering length has been calculated for @xmath62 = 1005 , 1505 , and 2005 . employing again the extrapolation formula ( [ extrap ] ) with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 being chosen according to these values , we find @xmath83 = 117.0  . the difference between the scattering length obtained for @xmath84 and the extrapolated value , hence , is 1.7  . a direct calculation for higher @xmath62 should lead to a modification rather close to this result . following this argumentation ,",
    "we conclude that the true value of @xmath42 for the lm2m2 and tty potentials lies between 115 and 116  .",
    "for completeness we mention that besides the above _ ab initio _ calculations there are also model calculations , the results of which are given in the last two columns of table [ tablesclength ] .",
    "the calculations of @xcite are based on employing a yamaguchi potential that leads to an easily solvable one - dimensional integral equation in momentum space .",
    "the approach of @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) represents intrinsically a zero - range model with a cut - off introduced to make the resulting one - dimensional skornyakov - ter - martirosian equation @xcite well defined .",
    "the cut - off parameter in @xcite as well as the range parameter of the yamaguchi potential in @xcite are adjusted to the three - body binding energy obtained in the _ ab initio _ calculations . in other words ,",
