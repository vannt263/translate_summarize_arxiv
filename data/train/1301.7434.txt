    "the equilibrium behaviour of a fluid in contact with a solid substrate is ruled by the interfacial free energy , i.e. , the amount of free energy needed to create the interface  @xcite .",
    "since this free energy is the product of the interfacial tension and the total contact area , the fluid equilibrium behaviour at a substrate can be controlled by either manipulation of the chemical properties of the surface ( interfacial tension ) or the geometry of the surface ( contact area ) .",
    "it is known that corrugated surfaces have a higher contact area with respect to a flat surface with the same cross - sectional area  @xcite , and in nature , corrugation gives the lotus flower  @xcite its characteristic hydrophobicity .",
    "efforts to mimic the lotus effect resulted in the production of micromachined surfaces whose wettability has been controlled by proper surface microstructuring  @xcite . from a fundamental point of view wetting and capillary condensation on structured  @xcite or curved substrates  @xcite as well as on surfaces with wedge geometry  @xcite have been studied in detail ( see also the review by  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , while a lot of research has been done for simple fluids , the effect of corrugation has been neglected in complex colloidal fluids because the roughness of a substrate normally occurs at length scales that are much smaller than the typical size of a colloidal particle .",
    "recently , a technique has been introduced that allows the controlled wrinkling of surfaces  @xcite on the micron scale .",
    "the effect of wrinkled substrates on crystallisation has been investigated  @xcite , and the resulting structures have been used to enhance surface raman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the wrinkling technique could allow a systematic study of the effect of roughness on the phase and wetting behaviour of complex fluids .    in this article",
    ", we investigate with computer simulations the phase behaviour of a mixture of colloid and non - adsorbing polymers confined between a wrinkled wall and a flat wall .",
    "we chose colloid - polymer mixtures because they have been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite , both from a theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "in particular , such mixtures allowed the investigation of a variety of fundamental inhomogeneous statistical phenomena such as wetting at single flat walls  @xcite and capillary condensation and evaporation between flat walls  @xcite . here , we describe the colloid - polymer mixture using the asakura - osaawa - vrij ( aov )  @xcite model .",
    "interestingly , the depletion attraction between colloids and the corrugated wall depends on the local curvature of the wall ( the same effect occurs for mixtures of hard spheres  @xcite ) . we find that for increased amplitude of corrugation the capillary condensation is stronger , i.e. the region of the phase diagram ( phase space ) where capillary condensation occurs becomes larger .",
    "we also analyse the confined system using a simple thermodynamic description , derive a kelvin equation and study its validity by comparing the theoretical predictions to the simulation results .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation is good , and indicate that the increased contact area between the fluid and the substrate ( due to corrugation ) is the primary cause for the stronger capillary condensation .",
    "a dramatic increase in colloidal adsorption at the corrugated wall is also primarily due to the increased surface area . on the other hand",
    ", further analysis suggests that other effects influence the thermodynamics of the system , like for example the curvature dependence of the particle wall interaction .",
    "furthermore , we find that the crossover from a quasi-2d to a quasi-1d system leads to the emergence of metastable phases characterised by a sequence of filled and empty quasi-1d channels .",

    "the asakura - osaawa - vrij ( aov )  @xcite model is a binary mixture of colloidal hard spheres of diameter @xmath0 and of spheres with diameter @xmath1 representing polymer coils ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a ) .",
    "the pair interaction between colloids is that of hard spheres : @xmath2 if @xmath3 and zero otherwise , where @xmath4 is the separation distance between particle centres .",
    "the interaction between a colloid and a polymer is also that of hard spheres : @xmath5 if @xmath6 and zero otherwise . the polymers ,",
    "however , are assumed to be ideal , hence the polymer - polymer interaction vanishes for all distances , @xmath7 .",
    "the size ratio @xmath8 is a geometric control parameter .",
    "the colloid - polymer mixture is confined between one smooth planar hard wall at @xmath9 and one sinusoidal hard wall at @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a measure of the distance of the two walls , @xmath12 is the amplitude of the sinusoidal corrugation , @xmath13 is its wavelength , and @xmath14 is the lateral coordinate perpendicular to the wrinkles .",
    "any overlap between particles and walls is omitted , therefore the external potentials acting on species @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the free volume available to the particles as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b ) .",
    "the polymers induce an effective colloid - colloid and colloid - wall attraction that is of entropic origin and is due to the so - called depletion effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c ) , we show a colloid in contact with a wall . around the colloid",
    "there is a depletion region ( dashed circle ) prohibited to the polymers due to the colloid - polymer hard - core interaction ( the chains can not penetrate the colloids ) .",
    "the hard - core interaction between polymers and the wall gives rise to a depletion zone at the wall ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c ) .",
    "if two colloids approach each other , so that two depletion zones overlap there is an increase in free volume for the polymer chains , i.e. , an increase in entropy @xcite .",
    "the increase in entropy can be described by an attractive interaction between colloidal particles .",
    "likewise , there is an increase in entropy when the depletion zones of colloids and wall overlap ( grey zone ) .",
    "the larger the excluded volumes , the stronger is the effective attraction between the hard wall and the colloids .",
    "figure  [ fig : model]d ) illustrates the depletion zone of a curved wall . clearly , the gained free volume ( grey zones ) depends on the local curvature of the wall .",
    "the concave part of the wall leads to a larger gain in free volume ( more attractive ) than the convex part of the wall ( less attractive ) .",
    "we denote the packing fractions by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of particles of species @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the cross - sectional ( normal to the @xmath22-direction ) area of the wrinkled wall , and also equal to the area of the flat wall .",
    "additional thermodynamic quantities are the scaled chemical potential @xmath23 and @xmath24 of colloids and polymers , respectively , and the polymer reservoir packing fraction @xmath25 of a reservoir of pure polymers that is in chemical equilibrium with the system .",

    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in the @xmath14- and @xmath30-directions , and the box size in the @xmath14-direction was chosen as @xmath31 .",
    "we carried out monte carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble , i.e. with fixed volume , temperature , and chemical potentials @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "to study the phase coexistence , we sample the probability @xmath32 of observing @xmath33 colloids in a volume @xmath34 using the successive umbrella sampling  @xcite .",
    "we use the histogram reweighing technique to obtain the probability distribution for any @xmath35 once @xmath32 is known for a given @xmath36 : @xmath37 at phase coexistence , the distribution function @xmath38 becomes bimodal with two separate peaks of equal area for the colloidal liquid and gas phases . we determine which @xmath39 satisfies the equal area rule @xmath40 with the average number of colloids @xmath41 using the histogram reweighing equation ( [ histogram ] ) .",
    "the sampling of the probability ratio @xmath42 is done , in each window , until the difference between two successive samplings of the probability ratio is smaller than @xmath43 . to improve the sampling accuracy , we used the cluster move introduced by  @xcite .",
    "we apply a thermodynamic treatment in the limits of @xmath44 and @xmath45 to the system sketched in fig .  [",

    "the derivation follows closely the derivation of  @xcite for fluids between smooth parallel walls . for simplicity",
    "we limit the theoretical derivation to the case of one - component fluids .",
    "as will become clear at the end the section , the result can be generalised effortlessly to multi - components fluids .",
    "the free energy in the grand canonical ensemble is the grand potential @xmath46 . for a fluid between a top and a bottom walls of area @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , the grand potential is the sum of the bulk free energy per unit volume @xmath49 and the surface energy contributions from the two walls , @xmath50 where @xmath34 is the volume , @xmath51 is the chemical potential and @xmath52 , are the fluid - wall interfacial tensions for the top and bottom wall , respectively .",
    "we introduce the bulk chemical potential at coexistence @xmath53 , and use it as a reference state for the chemical potential of the confined system @xmath54 assuming @xmath55 small we taylor expand equation ( [ omega ] ) around @xmath53 , recalling that the bulk density is @xmath56 and that the adsorption is @xmath57 the taylor expansion yields @xmath58 the coexistence between a liquid and a gas phase inside the slit occurs when both thermal and mechanical equilibrium conditions are satisfied , i.e. , the chemical potential and pressure of the gas and liquid phases are the same .",
    "these two conditions are satisfied when the grand potential of the two phases is the same @xmath59 .",
    "given that @xmath60 , the above equilibrium condition inside the slit leads to the following relation @xmath61 we stress that the above relation ( [ k1 ] ) is valid for any type of surface , as we only requested that @xmath55 be small .",
    "the previous relation greatly simplifies if we further assume that the adsorption at the wall is negligible and that @xmath62 , in which case @xmath63    we stress that the assumption @xmath62 implicitly considers a curvature independent interfacial tension .",
    "that is , we treat the limit of @xmath64 .",
    "this apparently crude approximation is justified in the framework of the kelvin equation that treats systems in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "strictly speaking , the kelvin equation is not valid for strongly confined systems , but has been shown before that its predictions remain qualitatively good down to quasi-2d systems .",
    "this theoretical description would on the other hand break down in the quasi-1d limit , because it would predict a phase transition that in reality does not exists for a bulk one - dimensional system .",

    "( [ kf ] ) and ( [ k3 ] ) we find also that the ratio between the chemical potential shifts of the corrugated and flat walls is related to the wenzel ratio via @xmath74      for the case of two corrugated walls the general kelvin equation ( [ k2 ] ) becomes    @xmath75    by comparing eqs .",

    "<S> we investigate with monte carlo computer simulations the capillary phase behaviour of model colloid - polymer mixtures confined between a flat wall and a corrugated wall . </S>",
    "<S> the corrugation is modelled via a sine wave as a function of one of the in - plane coordinates leading to a depletion attraction between colloids and the corrugated wall that is curvature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for increased amplitude of corrugation the region of the phase diagram where capillary condensation occurs becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a kelvin equation for this system and compare its predictions to the simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement between theory and simulation indicating that the primary reason for the stronger capillary condensation is an increased contact area between the fluid and the corrugated substrate . on the other hand , the colloid adsorption curves at colloid </S>",
    "<S> gas - liquid coexistence show that the increased area is not solely responsible for the stronger capillary condensation . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we analyse the dimensional crossover from a quasi-2d to a quasi-1d system and find that the transition is characterised by the appearance of a metastable phase . </S>"
