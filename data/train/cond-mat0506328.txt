    "@xcite has produced the correct orbital and magnetic ground state of ytio@xmath2 , but has not provided quantitative estimates for the superexchange couplings between nearest - neighbor ti ions .",
    "these couplings are required in order to understand quantitatively the magnetic structure and the spin - wave spectrum observed in experiment @xcite .    from the microscopic point of view , ytio@xmath2 is quite similar to the _ antiferromagnetic _ mott insulator latio@xmath2 : in both compounds there is a single electron in the 3@xmath12 shell of ti , and both have the same space group , @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth noting in this connection that the magnetic structure of latio@xmath2 is also quite complicated : experiment has indicated a predominant antiferromagnetic g - type moment along the @xmath7 axis and a small ferromagnetic moment along the @xmath4 axis @xcite , and a recent theory @xcite has predicted a small a - type moment along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "we have recently presented a detailed model for latio@xmath2 @xcite , which proved successful in describing the orbital and magnetic ordering of that material and provided the superexchange couplings and the spin - wave dispersion measured in experiment @xcite .",
    "because of the apparent similarity between ytio@xmath2 and latio@xmath2 , one may hope that the same model will explain the former as well . in this paper",
    "we carry out such investigation .",
    "unfortunately , our model does not yield the correct isotropic heisenberg superexchange coupling between nearest - neighbor ti ions .",
    "the reason is that there are both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic contributions to that coupling , which have roughly the same order of magnitude .",

    "it has been found in other systems @xcite that such calculations yield inaccurate values for the leading heisenberg ( isotropic ) couplings , but are quite reliable for the much smaller anisotropic ones .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to combine the experimental information on the isotropic couplings together with the calculated values of the anisotropic ones , in order to determine the magnetic structure of the ground state and the spin excitations .",

    "the experimental dispersion has been plotted as a single branch over the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) of a pure ferromagnet @xcite .",

    "this rotation still leaves the freedom to choose the new local @xmath18 and @xmath19 axes , i.e. , to rotate the new coordinate system around its @xmath20 axis . denoting the new local coordinate system by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , we find that the convenient choice for our purpose is @xmath31 in the rotated coordinate system the spin hamiltonian , comprising all three types of magnetic couplings , takes the form @xmath32 where the primes denote the rotated quantities . in particular",
    ", @xmath33 is the 3@xmath343 superexchange matrix in rotated coordinates .    since we consider only the ti ions , it is convenient to use a coordinate system in which the ti ions occupy the sites of a simple cubic lattice , of unit lattice constant ( this picture is the appropriate one for comparing with the experimental spin - wave data @xcite , as discussed in the next subsection ) .",
    "it is also convenient to use a coordinate system in which nearest - neighbor ti ions are located along the axes ( namely , to rotate the orthorhombic coordinates by @xmath35 around the @xmath20 axis , see fig .",

    "all four spin - wave modes are highly non - degenerate over a wide range of the mbz .",
    "in contrast , in the case of latio@xmath2 we have found @xcite that the four modes constitute two pairs of quasi - degenerate branches .",
    "the reason for this difference between the two systems is related to the smallness of the angle @xmath87 in latio@xmath2 ( as opposed to its significant value in the case of ytio@xmath2 , see table [ macroscres ] ) . in latio@xmath2",
    "there is a nearly full translational symmetry , leading to the quasi - degeneracy of the modes .",
    "we have presented a detailed model that aims to describe the orbital and the magnetic orders in ytio@xmath2 . while the orbital order that we have calculated turns out to agree very well with experiment , this is not the case for the magnetic superexchange couplings : to the lowest order in perturbation theory , we find that the approximate isotropic coupling between the @xmath1 planes is antiferromagnetic , while experiment indicates that it is ferromagnetic .",
    "this discrepancy is apparently due to a strong competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic contributions to that coupling .",
    "the approximations we employ are not sensitive enough to resolve successfully this competition .",
    "in particular , the neglect of exchange processes which involve double @xmath88 holes in the intermediate states , and of the ti@xmath89 admixture into the ground state caused by the covalent crystal field may be detrimental to the calculation of the isotropic magnetic coupling .",
    "in fact , the titanates are notorious for the difficulties one encounters when trying to microscopically derive their properties .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite finds a predominant a - type antiferromagnetic coupling for latio@xmath2 while ref .",
    "@xcite predicts a ferromagnetic one , both contradicting the experimentally detected g - type coupling of that material .",
    "our work on that compound @xcite has yielded the correct magnetic order , but the application of the same model to ytio@xmath2 turns out to be not so successful .",
    "similar problems have been reported in other studies of ytio@xmath2 .",
    "reference @xcite , while deriving ferromagnetic couplings , predicts ( in contradiction to the experiment ) a strong anisotropy between the intra and the inter - plane couplings , i.e. , @xmath90 mev and @xmath91 mev .",
    "reference @xcite finds antiferromagnetic values for both these couplings in a parameter range which is considered to be realistic .",
    "both these papers use models which are different than ours , but they also employ perturbation theory to second order in the ti  ti hopping to derive the required superexchange parameters",
    ".    it should be emphasized , however , that the starting point of our model , i.e. , the crystal field and the orbital ordering it implies do give a faithful description for ytio@xmath2 .",
    "the failure of our model in producing correctly the isotropic heisenberg coupling between the @xmath1 planes is likely to be related to the use of low order perturbation theory and to subtle inaccuracies in the parameters used . the alternative possibility suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite based on orbital fluctuations is , in our opinion , not adequate , since it defies the experimentally - detected orbital order of the ground state .    in view of the above difficulties , and",
    "since it is known that perturbation theory may be insufficient for the leading isotropic couplings but may well be reliable for the anisotropic ones , we have combined together the experimentally - deduced isotropic couplings of ytio@xmath2 with the computed anisotropic ones , to calculate the classical magnetic ground state .",
    "the result turns out to be satisfactory , when compared with experiment .",
    "similarly to latio@xmath2 , we obtain a g - type moment along the crystallographic @xmath7 axis , an a - type moment along the @xmath8 axis , and a ferromagnetic moment along the @xmath4 axis , the latter being the predominant one .",
    "remarkably , this detailed structure is caused by the anisotropies , and can not be derived solely on the basis of symmetry arguments .",
    "an even further check of our procedure is provided by the calculation of the spin - wave excitations .",
    "we find four dispersions : three of them have considerable zone - center gaps , 6 mev , 12 mev , and 17 mev , while the fourth one has a very small gap , of the order of 0.3 mev , and is approximately isotropic over the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "we have demonstrated that all branches have experimental counterparts as can be deduced from neutron - scattering data .",
    "comparing the calculated dispersion with the experimental one , we have found that they are in a plausible agreement .",

    "<S> using a point - charge calculation of the electrostatic crystal field , we determine the non - degenerate orbital ground state of the ferromagnetic mott insulator ytio@xmath0 , which is found to agree perfectly with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> based on the orbital order , we obtain by perturbation theory an effective spin hamiltonian that describes the magnetic superexchange between nearest - neighbor ti ions . </S>",
    "<S> the superexchange hamiltonian includes , in addition to the isotropic heisenberg coupling , antisymmetric ( dzyaloshinskii - moriya ) and symmetric anisotropy terms , caused by the spin - orbit interaction on the ti ions . </S>",
    "<S> we find ferromagnetic heisenberg couplings for ti  </S>",
    "<S> ti bonds in the crystallographic @xmath1 planes , but antiferromagnetic ones for ti  </S>",
    "<S> ti bonds between planes , in contradiction with experiment ( which gives ferromagnetic couplings for both ) . </S>",
    "<S> difficulties in calculating realistic values for the isotropic couplings of ytio@xmath2 have been already reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible origins for these discrepancies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the much smaller values we obtain for the symmetric and antisymmetric anisotropies may be expected to be reliable . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore combine the experimentally - deduced isotropic coupling with the calculated anisotropic ones to determine the magnetic order of the ti ions , which is found to be in satisfactory agreement with experiment . based on this magnetic order </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the spin - wave spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find an acoustic branch with a very small zone - center gap and three optical spin - wave modes with sizeable zone - center gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic branch reproduces the one reported in experiment , and the optical ones are in a satisfactory agreement with experiment , upon a proper folding of the magnetic brillouin zone . </S>"
