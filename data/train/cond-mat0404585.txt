    "finite and semi - infinite systems are not as easy and straightforward as infinite systems , and they usually require more careful treatment due to the boundary of the systems . earlier , kogan developed a clever technique based on london approach to study a vortex near the 2d film s edge @xcite . while developing our method , we stick to his technique and geometry in which a very thin sc film is located at x - y half plane while its edge is at x=0 ( see fig.[semi ] ) , and generalize his method for more than one vortex .",
