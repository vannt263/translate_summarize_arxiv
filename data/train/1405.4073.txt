    "double field theory ( dft ) @xcite is a formulation with doubled dimension .",
    "the extra coordinates are motivated by string theory .",
    "one question naturally arises , could we know string features from dft ? . from common sense , string is one dimensional , but particle is zero dimensional , thus dft needs more degrees of freedom than usual field theory .",
    "one obvious way is to double the coordinates .",
    "the extra coordinates are dual to winding modes on massless closed string theory .",
    "it turns out that we can have manifest and well - defined t - duality in the case of massless closed string theory .",
    "it gives an evidence that we can incorporate string features into field theory from the doubled coordinates this way .",
    "general relativity has at its foundation , semi - riemannian geometry . from general relativity",
    ", we understand that geometry is related to matter . in other words",
    ", geometry depends on what kind of objects that we describe because geometry can not decouple from matter .",
    "if the objects are point particles , we can use semi - riemannian geometry to describe as before .",
    "it is a continuous manifold and the distance can be arbitrary small .",
    "but this smooth geometry should break down for stringy objects .",
    "we possibly need to replace semi - riemannian geometry by a new geometry .",
    "we call this new geometry stringy geometry .",
    "stringy geometry also leads us to some non - geometric problems @xcite .",
    "we can not define t - duality in semi - riemannian geometry so a deeper understanding of stringy geometry @xcite should be a good motivation to study double field theory in more details .    one interesting aspect of non - geometric problems is to reformulate the standard ten dimensional supergravity ( ns - ns ) into new ten dimensional supergravity @xcite .",
    "this new theory can be obtained from the standard ns - ns lagrangian by field redefinition from the metric ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6-field ( @xmath7 ) and dilaton ( @xmath8 ) to the new fields @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this field redefinition leads us to get @xmath12- and @xmath13-flux from the standard three form flux @xmath14 .",
    "this new supergravity is called @xmath15-supergravity .",
    "fortunately , this formulation can relate these backgrounds to the four dimensional supergravity . from @xmath15-supergravity , we can study non - geometric flux directly in ten dimension .",
    "this is one revolution in double field theory .",
    "another interesting feature in double field theory is the extension of double field theory to higher derivative @xmath16 corrections @xcite .",
    "one related formulation for double field theory is the so - called exceptional field theory@xcite for eleven dimensional supergravity .",
    "before this was not obvious for @xmath17 in eleven dimensional supergravity for each @xmath18 . especially for @xmath18=8 , we met difficulty of non - closure algebra @xcite .",
    "now , we already knew how to overcome some difficulties to obtain eleven dimensional supergravity by sacrificing some lonrentz gauge freedoms @xcite .",
    "for details , we can see some recent reviews in double field theory @xcite .",
    "the other related construction is generalized geometry @xcite . in generalized geometry ,",
    "no additional coordinates are introduced .",
    "instead , we consider tangent space and cotangent space together .",
    "a main ingredient in differential geometry is the various notions of derivatives of tensorial elements along the directions of velocity vectors , e.g. , the lie derivatives .",
    "the properties of lie derivatives include jacobi identity and leibniz rule are useful in physics .",
    "two important quantities in differential geometry are curvature and torsion .",
    "the extension of curvature and torsion in the context of generalized geometry are also discussed @xcite .",
    "one of the familiar algebras in generalized geometry is the courant algebra @xcite .",
    "other interesting features of generalized geometry is reduction @xcite , exceptional generalized geometry ( egg ) @xcite and supergravity @xcite .",
    "the main point of this paper is to study classical analysis of double field theory since such analysis did not receive much attention ; only a few papers worked on this direction @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this work is to understand the structure of solution with respect to manifest @xmath19 structure .",
    "the current situation of double field theory is well - defined with strong constraint , but it is not what we expect .",
    "some fluxes do not appear when we do compactification because strong constraint is too restrictive .",
    "one direction of relaxing strong constraint is the classical analysis of double field theory - solving equations of motion in double field theory may possibly shed light on relaxing strong constraint .",
    "however relaxing constraint is the same as annihilating unwanted solutions .",
    "therefore , solving equations of motion should be a more direct approach to understand this problem .",
    "in view of this motivation , we do not use strong constraint to solve equations of motion . in this paper , we focus on frw and doubled spherically symmetric metric , and perform cosmological analysis . we find that our frw solutions are unstable against isotropic perturbation .",
    "however this only means that the solutions need fine - tuning . in these solutions ,",
    "we find one solution can potentially describe inflationary cosmology .",
    "the plan of this paper is to first review massless closed string of double field theory in sec .",
    "then we show frw and doubled spherically symmetric solutions of this theory in sec .",
    "finally , we give the summary , conclusions and the possible future directions in sec . [ 4 ] .",
    "we review the double field theory of massless closed string in this section . at first",
    ", we introduce some convenient notations for dft and then write down the action and gauge symmetry for manifestly background independent @xcite and generalized metric formulation @xcite .",
    "finally , we show the derivation of the generalized scalar curvature and ricci tensor .",
    "double field theory is defined on a manifold with doubled dimensions .",
    "the fields in dft depend on the ordinary coordinates @xmath20 and the dual coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "the dual coordinates are associated with winding excitations .",
    "the field components of dft for massless closed string @xcite are the metric field ( @xmath22 ) , antisymmetric field ( @xmath23 ) and scalar dilaton ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "on the other hand , if we impose the first constraint relation only , _",
