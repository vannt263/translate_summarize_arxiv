    "we always assume that @xmath11 .    of particular interest",
    "is the existence and geometry of metrics of this type which are also einstein .",
    "the existence of ( ke ) edge metrics was first conjectured by tian in the mid 90 s @xcite . in fact , tian conjectured the existence of ke metrics with ` crossing ' edge singularities when @xmath6 has simple normal crossings .",
    "one motivation was his observation that these metrics could be used to prove various inequalities in algebraic geometry ; in particular , the miyaoka  yau inequality could be proved by deforming the cone angle of edge metrics with negative curvature to @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , these metrics can be used to bound the degree of immersed curves in general type varieties .",
    "he also anticipated that the complete tian ",
    "yau ke metric on the complement of a divisor should be the limit of the edge metrics as the angle @xmath13 tends to @xmath14 .",
    "recently , donaldson @xcite proposed using these metrics in a similar way to construct smooth metrics on fano manifolds by deforming the cone angle of metrics of positive curvature , and more generally to relate this approach to the much - studied obstructions to existence of smooth metrics .",
    "one of the main results in this article is a proof of tian s conjecture on the existence of edge metrics when @xmath6 is smooth . in a sequel to this article",
    "we shall prove the general case @xcite ; this involves certain additional complications , but can be achieved by an elaboration of the methods introduced here .    in the lowest dimensional",
    "setting , @xmath0 is a riemann surface and the problem is to find constant curvature metrics with prescribed conic singularities at a finite collection of points .",
    "this was accomplished in general by mcowen and troyanov @xcite ; as part of this , troyanov found some interesting restrictions on the cone angles necessary for the existence of spherical cone metrics .",
    "later , luo and tian @xcite established the uniqueness of these metrics .",
    "for the problem in higher dimensions , we focus only on the case where @xmath6 is smooth , unless explicitly stated .",
    "the case of edge metrics with negative curvature was studied by the first named author @xcite , where it was already realized that some of the a priori estimates of aubin and yau @xcite should carry over to this setting .",
    "an announcement for the existence in that negative case with @xmath15 $ ] was made over ten years ago by the first and second named authors @xcite .",
    "there were several analytic issues described in that announcement which seemed to complicate the argument substantially and details never appeared .",
    "quite recently there has been a renewed interest in these problems stemming from an important advance by donaldson @xcite , alluded to just above , whose insightful observations make it possible to establish good linear estimates .",
    "he proves a deformation theorem , showing that the set of attainable cone angles for ke edge metrics is open .",
    "the key to his work is the identification of a function space on which the linearized equation is solvable in the class of bounded functions",
    ".    we realized , following the appearance of @xcite , that only a slight change of perspective suggested by his advance makes it possible to apply the theory of elliptic edge operators from @xcite in a rather direct manner so as to circumvent the difficulties surrounding the openness part of the argument proposed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show that estimates equivalent to those of donaldson ( but on slightly different function spaces ) follow directly from some of the basic results in that theory , and we explain this at some length .",
    "this alternate approach to the linear theory allows us to go somewhat further , and we use it to show that solutions are polyhomogeneous , i.e. , have complete asymptotic expansions .",
    "this was announced in @xcite and speculated on in @xcite , and the existence of this higher regularity should be very helpful in the further study of these metrics .",
    "in fact , this higher regularity plays a fundamental role in the nonlinear a priori estimates . in order to obtain our existence results it is necessary to work with minimal assumptions on the reference geometry , and polyhomogeneity is one of the key ingredients which allows us to do so . as a result , we are able to establish the existence theorem for all cone angles less than @xmath12 , which we carry out in the negative , zero and in certain positive curvature cases .",
    "more precisely , what we achieve here is the following .",
    "we prove existence of edge metrics with cone angle @xmath16 that have negative , zero and positive curvature , as appropriate , for all cone angles @xmath3 , when @xmath6 is smooth .",
    "existence in the positive case is proved under the condition that the twisted mabuchi k - energy is proper , in parallel to tian s result in the smooth case @xcite .",
    "next , we prove that solutions of a general class of complex equations are polyhomogeneous , i.e. , have complete asymptotic expansions with smooth coefficients .",
    "we provide a sharper identification of the function space defined by donaldson for his deformation result . as we have briefly",
    "noted above , there are two somewhat different scales of hlder spaces which can be used for this type of problem .",
    "one , used in @xcite , we call the wedge hlder spaces ; the other , from @xcite , are the edge hlder spaces . the latter behave more naturally with respect to a certain dilation structure which is inherent in this problem .",
    "this makes the linear theory , and certain parts of the nonlinear theory , more transparent .",
    "however , we stress that we provide two independent proofs of the a priori estimates , one in each class of spaces . the proof of higher regularity ( polyhomogeneity )",
    "is directly related to special properties of the edge spaces , but holds for solutions in either class of spaces , and because of this , the two approaches to the a priori estimates may be used interchangeably . finally , in proving the a priori estimates we have made an effort to extend various classical arguments and bounds to this singular setting with minimal assumptions on the background geometry .",
    "in particular , we employ a particular continuity method closely related to the ricci iteration @xcite , that together with the chern ",
    "lu inequality allows us to obtain the a priori estimate on the laplacian assuming only that the reference edge metric has bisectional curvature bounded above .",
    "we then explain how the evans  krylov theory together with our asymptotic expansion imply a priori hlder bounds on the second derivatives for all cone angles with no further curvature assumptions . reducing the dependence of the estimates for the existence of a metric to only an upper bound on the bisectional curvature of the reference metric does not seem to have been observed previously even in the smooth setting , where traditionally a lower bound on the bisectional curvature is required , or at least an upper bound on the bisectional curvature together with a lower bound on some curvature .",
    "finally , in the case of positive curvature , we show how to control the sobolev constant and infimum of the green function , which are both needed for the uniform estimate . in an appendix",
    "it is shown that the bisectional curvature of the reference metric is bounded from above on @xmath7 whenever @xmath17 $ ] .    before stating our results , let us mention some other recent articles concerning existence .",
    "quickly capitalizing on the linear estimates in @xcite , and originally part of the collaboration leading to the current article , brendle @xcite adapted the classical estimates of aubin and yau to obtain existence of ricci - flat ke edge metrics with @xmath15 $ ] . in a different direction , and allowing @xmath6 to have simple normal crossings , berman @xcite showed how to bypass the openess problem and produce ke metrics whose volume form is asymptotic to that of an edge metric by using a variational approach .",
    "finally , a quite different approach to existence and also allowing divisors with simple normal crossings , based on approximation by smooth metrics , has appeared in a recent article by campana , guenancia and pun @xcite in the case of nonpositive curvature with @xmath15 $ ] . however , neither of these methods give good information about the regularity of the solution metric at the divisor .",
    "we now state our main results more precisely .",
    "all the relevant notation is defined in sections [ prelimsection ] and [ linearsection ] .",

    "this metric is polyhomogeneous , namely , @xmath39 admits a complete asymptotic expansion with smooth coefficients as @xmath40 of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and with each @xmath44 .",
    "there are no terms of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 if @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 has infinite conormal regularity and a precise hlder regularity as measured relative to the reference edge metric @xmath18 , which is encoded by @xmath48 .",
    "to put these conclusions about regularity into words , we prove infinite ` conormal ' regularity ( @xmath49 ) , which asserts that the solution is tangentially smooth and also infinitely differentiable with respect to the vector field @xmath50 , then hlder continuity of some second derivatives with respect to the model metric ( @xmath51 ) , and finally the existence of an asymptotic expansion in powers of the distance to the edge ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this expansion also leads to the precise asymptotics of the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives .",

    "thus , @xmath69 is a positive or negative class if @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath72 , @xmath73 is an arbitrary class .",
    "let @xmath74 be any khler metric which is smooth ( or of some fixed finite regularity ) on @xmath75 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath74 is a edge metric with angle @xmath13 if , in any local holomorphic coordinate system near @xmath6 where @xmath10 , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 for some @xmath78 , where @xmath25 is a bounded function which is at least continuous at @xmath6 ( and which will have some specified regularity ) .",

[ kcurrent ]    in this section we present some preliminary facts about the geometry and analysis of the class of edge metrics .",
    "we first review some different coordinate charts near the edge @xmath6 used extensively below .",
    "many calculations in this article are most easily done in a singular real coordinate chart , although when the complex structure is particularly relevant to a calculation , we use certain adapted complex coordinate charts . while all of this is quite elementary , there are some identifications that can be confusing , so it is helpful to make all of this very explicit .",
    "we calculate the curvature tensor for any one such metric @xmath74 , assuming it is sufficiently regular .",
    "we then introduce the relevant class of edge potentials and describe the continuity method that will be used for the existence theory .",
    "as we recall , this particular continuity method is closely related to the ricci iteration , that , naturally , we also treat simultaneously in this article .",
    "we conclude the section with a fairly lengthy description of the various function spaces that will be used later . rather than a purely technical matter",
    ", this discussion gets to the heart of some of the more important analytic and geometric issues that must be faced here .",
    "there are two rather different choices of hlder spaces ; one is naturally associated to this class of khler edge metrics and was employed , albeit in a slightly different guise , by donaldson @xcite , while the other , from @xcite , is well adapted to this edge geometry because of its naturality under dilations and has been used in many other analytic and geometric problems where edges appear .",
    "as above , fix local complex coordinates @xmath84 with @xmath10 locally .",
    "there are two other coordinate systems which are quite useful for certain purposes .",
    "the first is a singular holomorphic coordinate chart , where we replace @xmath85 by @xmath86 .",
    "of course , @xmath87 is multi - valued , but we can work locally in the logarithmic riemann surface which uniformizes this variable . thus if @xmath76 , then @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the second is the real cylindrical coordinate system @xmath91 around @xmath6 , where @xmath92 as above , @xmath93 is the argument of @xmath85 , and @xmath94 .",
    "note that @xmath95 .",
    "we use either @xmath96 or @xmath97 in situations where the formalism of complex analysis is useful , and @xmath98 elsewhere . for later purposes ,",
    "note that @xmath99    one big advantage of either of these other coordinate systems is that they make the model metric @xmath79 appear less singular . indeed , @xmath100 in either case",
    ", one may regard the coordinate change as encoding the singularity of the metric via a singular coordinate system .",
    "this is only possible for edges of real codimension two , and there are many places , both in @xcite and here , where we take advantage of this special situation . for edges of higher codimension , one can not conceal the singular geometry so easily , see @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath79 in cylindrical coordinates makes clear that for any @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 ; the corresponding inequality in the original @xmath103 coordinates must be stated slightly differently , as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "we now compute the complex derivatives in these coordinates .",
    "we have @xmath106 and then @xmath107 the other mixed complex partials @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are compositions of the operators in and their conjugates and certain combinations of the @xmath111 . from this",
    "we obtain that @xmath112 since @xmath113 and @xmath114 and all other @xmath115 .",
    "as already described , we shall work with the class of khler metrics @xmath74 that satisfy condition , and which we call asymptotically equivalent to @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath74 is of this type , then @xmath116 for some @xmath78 , hence @xmath117 where @xmath118 here @xmath119 is determined from @xmath120 and @xmath63 , and all coefficients have some specified regularity down to @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , the coefficient matrix @xmath122 is positive definite , with @xmath123 independent of @xmath124 , and the coefficients @xmath125 are bounded as @xmath126 .",
    "thus there are no cross - terms to leading order , and the @xmath127 part of this operator is ` standard ' once we multiply the entire operator by @xmath25 .",
    "one way that this asymptotic structure will be used is as follows .",
    "fundamental to this work is the role of the family of dilations @xmath128 centered at some point @xmath129 corresponding to @xmath130 .",
    "if we push forward this operator by @xmath131 , which has the effect of expanding a very small neighbourhood of @xmath132 , then the principal part scales approximately like @xmath133 while @xmath134 scales like @xmath135 .",
    "hence , after a linear change of the @xmath136 coordinates , @xmath137 where @xmath138 . in particular , @xmath134 scales away completely .",
    "one important comment is that if the derivatives @xmath139 are all bounded , and if @xmath74 satisfies these asymptotic conditions , then so does @xmath140 , where @xmath141 .",
    "a key point in the treatment below , exploited by donaldson @xcite , is that for any khler metric @xmath74 , @xmath142 only involves combinations of the following second order operators : @xmath143 the precise combinations of the derivatives with respect to @xmath144 into their @xmath145 and @xmath146 parts is mostly irrelevant . for later reference",
    ", we therefore set @xmath147 and @xmath148 as a final note , let us record the form of the complex operator in these coordinates , for any khler metric which satisfies the decay assumptions above .",

    "then @xmath163 is non - empty .",
    "let @xmath164 be a smooth hermitian metric on @xmath165 .",
    "we claim that for @xmath166 sufficiently small , @xmath167 to prove this , it suffices to consider @xmath168 near @xmath2 .",
    "use a local holomorphic frame @xmath22 for @xmath165 and local holomorphic coordinates @xmath169 valid in a neighborhood of @xmath132 , such that @xmath170 , so that locally @xmath6 is cut out by @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath171 , and set @xmath172 , so @xmath173 .",

    "then @xmath175 for @xmath166 small , the form @xmath176 is positive definite and satisfies the conditions of , hence is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath177 .",
    "it is useful to record the form of @xmath178 in the @xmath179 coordinates as well .",
    "first note that if @xmath180 is a potential for @xmath158 , then using , @xmath181 next , @xmath182 , hence @xmath183 from these two expressions , it is clear once again that @xmath184 when @xmath185 is sufficiently small .",
    "putting these expressions together shows that @xmath186 is locally equal to @xmath187 the reason for writing the derivatives of @xmath180 and @xmath174 with respect to @xmath85 rather than @xmath87 is because we know that both of these functions are smooth in the original @xmath103 coordinates , and hence so are its derivatives with respect to @xmath103 .",
    "we now use this expression to deduce some properties of the curvature tensor of @xmath74 .",
    "this turns out to be simple in this singular holomorphic coordinate system .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath188 curvature tensor are given by @xmath189 where the indices after a comma indicate differentiation with respect to a variable .",

    "certain aspects of the proof work much more easily in one rather than the other , but we give a complete proof of the existence in either framework . the proof of higher regularity , which shows that these two approaches are ultimately equivalent , is very closely tied , however , to only one of these scales of spaces .",

    "our result below , in the case @xmath34 , is complementary to theirs since it shows how to use their uniform estimate and our analysis to obtain smooth convergence near the edge .",
    "we thank berman for his encouragement to include this result here , prior to the appearance of @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have the following statement .",
    "[ rithm ] under the assumptions of theorem [ conickemainthm ] , the ricci iteration exists uniquely and converges in @xmath251 to a unique edge metric in @xmath214 .",
    "these function spaces encode the strongest possible convergence for this problem , and are defined directly below .      to conclude this section of preliminary material , we review the various function spaces used below .",
    "these are the ` wedge and edge ' hlder spaces , as well as the spaces of conormal and polyhomogeneous functions necessary for our treatment of the the higher regularity theory .",
    "the wedge hlder spaces are the ones used in @xcite , and are naturally associated to the incomplete edge geometry .",
    "the edge spaces , introduced in @xcite are also naturally associated to this geometry and have some particularly favorable properties stemming from their invariance under dilations . using this , certain parts of the proofs",
    "below become quite simple .",
    "the wedge hlder spaces , on the other hand , are closer to standard hlder spaces , and indeed reduce to them when @xmath252 .",
    "they impose stronger regularity conditions .",
    "since we use both types of spaces here , we describe many of the proofs below with respect in both settings in hopes of giving the reader a better sense of their relative advantages .    before giving any of the formal definitions below ,",
    "let us recall that a hlder space is naturally associated to a distance function @xmath253 via the hlder seminorm @xmath254_{d ; 0 , \\gamma } : =   \\sup _ { p \\neq p ' \\atop d(p , p ' ) \\leq 1 } \\frac { |u(p ) - u(p')| } { d(p , p')^\\gamma}.\\ ] ] we only need to take the supremum over points with distance at most @xmath190 apart , since if @xmath255 , then this quotient is bounded by @xmath256 .",
    "the two different spaces below differ simply through the different choices of distance function @xmath253 .",
    "first consider the distance function @xmath257 associated to the model metric @xmath79 ; note that it is clearly equivalent to replace the actual @xmath79 distance function with any other function on @xmath258 which is uniformly equivalent , and it is simplest to use the one defined in the coordinates @xmath98 by @xmath259 note that the angle parameter @xmath63 does not appear explicitly in this formula , but if we were to have included it , there would be a factor of @xmath260 before @xmath261 .",
    "this changes @xmath257 at most by a factor , so we may as well omit it altogether .",
    "now define the wedge hlder space @xmath262 to consist of all functions @xmath28 on @xmath75 for which @xmath263_{d_1 ; 0 , \\gamma } < \\infty.\\ ] ]    the spaces with higher regularity are defined using differentiations with respect to unit length vector fields with respect to @xmath79 ; these vector fields are spanned by @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 . thus @xmath267    there is one potentially confusing point about these spaces , especially if we compare this definition with the equivalent one given in @xcite .",
    "as is evident from the definition above , the space @xmath268 above does _ not _ depend on the cone angle parameter @xmath63 ( at least so long as @xmath63 stays bounded away from @xmath14 and @xmath269 ) .",
    "however , suppose we consider the ( apparently ) fixed function @xmath270 for some @xmath271 in terms of the original holomorphic coordinates . in terms of",
    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath98 , we have @xmath272 for some constant @xmath185 , and hence @xmath273 if and only if @xmath274 , i.e. , @xmath275 .",
    "inequalities of this type appear in @xcite .",
    "this seems inconsistent with the claim that the hlder space is independent of @xmath63 ; the discrepancy between these statements is explained by observing that the singular coordinate change _ does _ depend on @xmath63 , and while the function @xmath276 is independent of @xmath63 , its composition with this coordinate change is not .",
    "equivalently , if we pull back the function space @xmath268 via this coordinate change , then we get a varying family of function spaces on @xmath0 .",
    "we prefer , however , to think of @xmath75 as a fixed but singular geometric object , with smooth structure determined by the coordinates @xmath98 , and with a single scale of naturally associated hlder spaces .",
    "now consider the distance function @xmath277 associated to the _ complete _ metric @xmath278 as before , we can replace the distance @xmath277 by another metric uniformly equivalent to it , which we take as @xmath279 where we only consider @xmath280 .",
    "as before , we do not need to include any factors of @xmath63 .",
    "the hlder norm @xmath281 is now defined using the seminorm associated to @xmath277 .",
    "the higher hlder norms are defined using unit - length vector fields with respect to @xmath282 , which are spanned by @xmath283 .",
    "the corresponding spaces of functions for which these norms are finite are denoted @xmath284 .",
    "we use the subscript @xmath22 here to follow long - established notation @xcite .",

    "the vector fields @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 are also invariant with respect to these dilations .",
    "this means that if @xmath290 , then @xmath291 .",
    "( we assume , of course , that both @xmath292 and @xmath293 lie in the domain of @xmath28 . )",

    ", we also define weighted edge hlder spaces @xmath303    although @xmath304 , elements of @xmath305 need not be continuous at @xmath121 ; an easy example is the function @xmath306 , which lies in @xmath307 for all @xmath243 . on the other hand , elements of @xmath308 are continuous and vanish at @xmath2 if @xmath309 .",
    "we now comment on the differences between these spaces .",
    "since @xmath280 , we have @xmath310 , and hence @xmath311 or equivalently , @xmath312    in fact , elements in the wedge hlder space enjoy significantly more regularity than those in the edge hlder space .",

    "however , there are also some big advantages to using them .",
    "first of all note that if @xmath320 , the function @xmath321 lies in @xmath268 only if @xmath322 , while @xmath323 for all @xmath324 .",

    "the edge spaces more naturally accomodate noninteger exponents .",
    "this is a big advantage when dealing with the singular elliptic equations under consideration here because solutions of such equations typically involve noninteger powers of @xmath331 , and it is quite reasonable to think of these solutions as being infinitely differentiable .",
    "thus , while it is possible to use the wedge hlder spaces for the existence and deformation theory of ke edge metrics , one is then forced to work with a restricted range of hlder exponents , and is then prevented from easily studying the higher differentiability properties of solutions .",
    "we shall see below how these issues are handled easily with the edge hlder spaces .    in the remainder of this article , whenever our discussion applies to both of these spaces , we refer to the ` generic ' singular hlder space @xmath332 , where @xmath333 this @xmath228",
    "should not be confused with the parameter @xmath228 along the continuity path ( [ tycmeq ] ) .      before proceeding",
    ", we also recall some intermediate spaces based on the edge geometry but which provide better control in the tangential ( @xmath334 ) directions . as remarked above ,",
    "if @xmath335 , then @xmath336 to remedy this , we introduce the following hybrid spaces :    for any @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 , define @xmath340 in other words , we still only allow @xmath341 derivatives , but up to @xmath342 of them may be taken with respect to @xmath334 while all the rest must be taken with respect to @xmath50 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "the final set of spaces we define are the spaces of conormal and polyhomogeneous functions .    for any @xmath337 ,",
    "define @xmath343 this is the space of conormal functions ( of weight @xmath344 ) .",
    "thus elements of @xmath345 are bounded by @xmath346 , as are all of their derivatives with respect to the vector fields @xmath50 , @xmath288 and @xmath334 .",
    "next , we say that @xmath347 is polyhomogeneous , and write @xmath348 , if it has an expansion of the form @xmath349 where the coefficients @xmath350 are all @xmath351 , and @xmath352 is a discrete sequence of complex numbers such that @xmath353 , with @xmath354 for all @xmath355 and @xmath356 if @xmath357 .",
    "this expansion can be differentiated arbitrarily many times with the corresponding differentiated remainder .",
    "we say that @xmath28 has a nonnegative index set if @xmath26 .",
    "note finally that if @xmath358 , then @xmath28 is bounded .",
    "[ co - phg ]    these spaces are the correct analogues of the spaces of infinitely differentiable functions in this context . unlike in the smooth setting ,",
    "however , we make a distinction between functions which are infinitely differential ( conormal ) and those which have `` taylor series '' expansions ( i.e. are polyhomogeneous ) .",
    "these function spaces accomodate behavior typical for solutions of degenerate elliptic edge problems , e.g. , functions like @xmath359 where @xmath360 is smooth , @xmath132 is a nonnegative integer and @xmath361 .",
    "we now present the key facts about the linear elliptic theory needed to handle the existence , deformation and regularity theory for canonical edge metrics .",
    "we discuss this from two points of view , on the one hand reviewing the estimates obtained by donaldson in the wedge hlder spaces , and also proving the analogous estimates in the edge hlder spaces as consequences of basic properties of edge pseudodifferential operators , as developed in @xcite .",
    "fix a khler edge metric @xmath74 on @xmath0 with cone angle @xmath362 along the smooth divisor @xmath2 ; we initially suppose that the metric @xmath74 is polyhomogeneous along @xmath6 , though this will be relaxed later . as in the introduction",
    ", we consider the laplacian @xmath363 , or slightly more generally , any operator of the form @xmath364 where @xmath365 is a polyhomogeneous function with nonnegative index set ( so that @xmath365 is bounded ) , or even just a bounded function with some given hlder regularity .    our goal here is to explain how the known polyhomogeneous structure of the schwartz kernel of the inverse for the friedrichs extension of @xmath366 leads to the estimates we need later .",
    "this inverse is a pseudodifferential edge operator , and the theory in @xcite yields rather detailed information about its schwartz kernel .",
    "we now recall certain aspects of this theory and explain how it applies to the problem at hand . in a parallel discussion",
    "we also recall donaldson s estimates and explain the relationship between these two approaches .      as we have already indicated in the definitions of the hlder spaces above",
    ", there is some advantage to considering the pair @xmath367 as a genuinely singular ( stratified ) object ; the general notion of an edge structure is a good way to formulate this .",
    "the general setting is as follows .",
    "let @xmath368 be a compact manifold with boundary , such that @xmath369 is the total space of a fibration , with fibre @xmath25 and base @xmath370 .",
    "for us , @xmath368 is the real blowup of @xmath0 around @xmath6 .",
    "this is a manifold with boundary , where @xmath369 is the unit normal sphere bundle @xmath371 of @xmath6 in @xmath0 , and hence is the total space of an @xmath372 bundle over @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , the real blowup @xmath373 $ ] is the disjoint union @xmath374 , endowed with the unique smallest topological and differential structure so that the lifts of smooth functions on @xmath0 and polar coordinates around @xmath2 are smooth .",
    "this comes equipped with a smooth blowdown map @xmath375 .",
    "there is a slight subtlety in the desription of this smooth structure which we already encountered above , which concerns the fact that there is an incompatibility between the smooth structure provided by the holomorphic coordinates @xmath57 , where @xmath376 locally , in terms of which the metrics we consider have the simplest descriptions _ as khler metrics _ , and the smooth structure provided by the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath98 we defined earlier . indeed , since @xmath42 , we see that functions smooth with respect to @xmath103 are not necessarily smooth with respect to @xmath98 and vice versa , although there is an equivalence between these two smooth structures ( provided by this coordinate transformation ) .",
    "this is closely analogous to a similar change of smooth structures that explains two descriptions of the asymptotic behaviour of the bergman and khler  einstein metrics near the boundary of a strictly pseudoconvex domain @xcite .",
    "the best way to come to terms with this inconsistency is to realize that what is important is _ not _ the smooth structure on @xmath368 but rather the ` polyhomogeneous structure ' , i.e. , the ring of polyhomogeneous functions , since this is invariant under this coordinate change . in any case , continuing on , @xmath369 is defined by @xmath377 , and the @xmath372 fibres are defined by @xmath378 . functions on @xmath368 are polyhomogeneous if they are polyhomogeneous either with respect to @xmath98 or else with respect to @xmath379 , @xmath93 , @xmath136 .    to continue with our description of edge structures ,",
    "define the space of smooth edge vector fields on @xmath368 .",
    "this is the space @xmath380 consisting of all smooth vector fields on @xmath368 which are unconstrained in the interior , but which lie tangent to the fibres at the boundary . for @xmath381",
    "$ ] , in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath380 is generated by @xmath50 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",

    "the operator @xmath389 is an edge operator in the sense defined just above .",
    "a differential edge operator @xmath390 is called elliptic if it is an ` elliptic combination ' of elements of @xmath380 , e.g. , a sum of squares of a generating set of sections plus lower order terms .",
    "this is the case here and we refer to @xcite for a formulation of ellipticity in this setting , and in particular a coordinate - invariant notion of an edge symbol .",
    "if @xmath390 is an elliptic edge operator , its mapping properties are governed not only by its ellipticity , but by two model operators defined at any point of @xmath2 . in the general theory these",
    "are called the indicial and normal operators , @xmath391 and @xmath392 , respectively , and there is an invariant description for these too .",
    "here we simply record that for @xmath389 , @xmath393 where @xmath394 are global affine coordinates on a half - space @xmath395 and @xmath396 .",
    "formally , @xmath392 is obtained by dropping the error term @xmath134 , freezing coordinates at a given point @xmath397 , and replacing the local coordinates @xmath398 by the global affine coordinates @xmath394 ; more invariantly , @xmath392 acts on functions on the inward - pointing normal bundle of the fiber of @xmath369 over @xmath296 .",
    "similarly , @xmath391 is defined by dropping the terms in @xmath392 which have the property that they map any function @xmath399 ( with @xmath400 smooth ) to a function which vanishes faster than @xmath401 .",
    "the only term in the operator @xmath392 above which has this effect is @xmath402 .",
    "in general , both @xmath392 and @xmath391 could depend on @xmath296 ( for example , if the cone angle varies along @xmath2 ) , but here they do not .",
    "note that @xmath403 is the laplacian of the flat model metric @xmath79 .",
    "a number @xmath404 is called an indicial root of @xmath390 ( and also of @xmath366 ) if there is some nontrivial @xmath405 such that @xmath406 ; for @xmath389 , @xmath407 hence , @xmath14 is a ` double ' indicial root , which means that both @xmath408 and @xmath409 , which is special to the fact that @xmath2 has codimension @xmath410 .",
    "it is important that @xmath93 lies on a compact manifold ( namely , @xmath372 ) , since these indicial roots are just the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath411 .",
    "note also that for any @xmath360 and @xmath412 , we always have @xmath413 , and @xmath360 is an indicial root if and only if @xmath414 and @xmath415 ( multiplied by an arbitrary function of @xmath136 ) .",
    "we next describe the basic mapping properties of @xmath366 on weighted hlder spaces ; they follow from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.4 ) applied to the operator @xmath389 .",
    "the mapping @xmath416 has closed range if and only if @xmath417 . [ mappingprop ]    the weights corresponding to indicial roots are excluded because , as it is not difficult to see , at these values this mapping does not have closed range . the emphasis in @xcite is on the fredholm and semi - fredholm theory ( in fact , is never fredholm in our case : when @xmath418 , the nullspace is infinite dimensional , while if @xmath309 is nonindicial , the cokernel is closed but infinite dimensional ) .",
    "this lack of a ` fredholm range ' is again special to an edge of real codimension two .",
    "it is more useful , however , to consider @xmath366 as an unbounded operator acting on a single space , rather than as an operator between two differently weighted spaces .",

    "the canonical self - adjoint _ friedrichs _ extension is defined in the customary way using the coercive quadratic form @xmath427 in our setting we can identify the friedrichs domain @xmath428 , i.e. , the domain of this friedrichs extension , quite explicitly .",
    "one can show , see @xcite , that any @xmath429 has a ` weak ' partial expansion @xmath430 , where @xmath431 for some @xmath70 ; it is weak in the sense that it is an asymptotic expansion in the usual sense ( in particular , with decaying remainder ) only if both sides are paired with a test function @xmath432 ( depending only on @xmath136 ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath28 lies in this friedrichs domain if and only if @xmath433 in general , if @xmath28 does not lie in the friedrichs domain , then this expansion would have an extra term on the right of the form @xmath434 , so the friedrichs condition is simply that this coefficient of @xmath435 vanish for all @xmath436 , i.e. , that the distribution @xmath437 vanish .",
    "a principal source of the difficulties reported in @xcite revolved around the issue of working with such weak expansions .",
    "henceforth we only work with the friedrichs extension of @xmath366 , and denote it simply by @xmath366 .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce using hardy - type estimates that the domain @xmath428 is compactly contained in @xmath438 , which means that @xmath366 has discrete spectrum .",
    "the nullspace is finite dimensional and consists of bounded polyhomogeneous ( provided both @xmath74 and @xmath365 are polyhomogeneous ) functions @xmath439 the generalized inverse of @xmath366 , so @xmath440 where @xmath441 is the finite rank orthogonal projector onto the nullspace .",
    "in contrast to proposition  [ mappingprop ] , we now focus on the mapping @xmath442 which is invertible at least on a subspace of finite codimension .",
    "we commenced with the @xmath438 theory , which is well - known , but now shift to the analogous but less well known analogue in hlder spaces .",
    "thus , proceeding by analogy with these @xmath438 definitions , set @xmath443 note that if @xmath28 is only assumed to be bounded and to satisfy @xmath444 , then for @xmath445 , it is a standard consequence of regularity in the edge theory that @xmath446 .",

    "we prove two main things here .",
    "first , @xmath469 is strictly smaller than @xmath447 , while @xmath450 is strictly larger than @xmath470 ; we characterize these domains in terms of which derivatives lie in @xmath471 .",
    "second , we show that this domain is independent of the operator @xmath366 in the sense that it remains the same if we replace the polyhomogeneous khler edge metric @xmath18 by any metric @xmath472 , where the khler potential @xmath28 itself only lies in @xmath473 , and @xmath474 .",
    "the first of these issues is the analogue of a classical result that the friedrichs domain of the laplacian on a closed smooth manifold @xmath0 is just @xmath475 ; in other words , if @xmath28 is in the friedrichs domain , then _ every _ first and second derivative lies in @xmath438 , and conversely .",
    "this follows from the classical elliptic estimates in sobolev spaces , of course , but is also equivalent to the classical fact that the riesz potentials @xmath476 are bounded operators on @xmath438 . for operators with smooth coefficients ,",
    "the analogous fact is an immediate consequence of the @xmath438 boundedness of pseudodifferential operators of order @xmath14 , since the analogous ` variable curvature riesz potentials ' lie in this class . for metrics and operators with rougher coefficients",
    ", we could use that riesz potentials are singular integral operators ( i.e. , calderon - zygmund operators ) , and invoke the standard boundedness properties of that class of operators on either @xmath438 or hlder spaces .",
    "this outline inverts the history , since the theory of singular integral and pseudodifferential operators , and in particular their boundedness properties , was developed precisely to answer and generalize questions of this type .",
    "if @xmath28 is an arbitrary function in @xmath477 , then it is _ not _ true that every second derivative which appears in the operator @xmath366 applied to @xmath28 lands in @xmath471 .",
    "donaldson s simple yet crucial observation @xcite is that this is not necessary !",
    "as described in  2 , the operator only involves the particular combinations of second derivatives of the form @xmath478 ( no summation ) , or equivalently , using the notation introduced there , the expressions @xmath479 .",

    "a further analysis shows that @xmath590 has a singularity at @xmath591 and polyhomogeneous expansions along the side faces @xmath568 and @xmath569 .",
    "we now recall the general definition of polyhomogeneity .",
    "we do this only on the model orthant @xmath592 , with linear coordinates @xmath593 , but it is easy to see that this definition is coordinate - invariant , so this discussion translates immediately to arbitrary manifolds with corners .",

    "either method requires about the same amount of work .",
    "one seemingly minor point in the statement of proposition  [ strg ] which is important below is the fact that the index set @xmath134 does not contain the element @xmath145 , so in other words , the terms @xmath656 and @xmath657 do not appear in the expansion of @xmath439 at the left and right faces .",

    "we now state the basic boundedness theorem needed to prove proposition [ mainlinearprop ] .",

    "hence @xmath674 carries the full pseudodifferential singularity , while the schwartz kernel of @xmath676 is polyhomogeneous on @xmath552 .",
    "if @xmath677 , then the fact that @xmath678 can be proved by reducing to the standard boundedness of ( ordinary , nondegenerate ) pseudodifferential operators on hlder spaces using scaling arguments .",

    ", we refer to @xcite .    as for the case",
    "when these operators act on @xmath313 , the proof follows directly from proposition  [ bddpsido ] once we show that each @xmath682 satisfies the hypotheses there , specifically that it has nonpositive pseudodifferential order ( this is clear since @xmath499 has order less than or equal to @xmath410 while @xmath439 has order @xmath579 ) and that its index sets are all nonnegative .",
    "we claim that this is true for every @xmath683 , and if @xmath483 , then it is true for every @xmath684 .",
    "the key point is that each of the vector fields @xmath50 , @xmath288 and @xmath685 on @xmath368 lift smoothly via the blowdown map @xmath620 to @xmath552 ; indeed , each of these lifts is a vector field on this blown up space which is tangent to all boundary faces .",
    "thus @xmath686 is tangent to all faces , as is @xmath687 , while @xmath688 differentiates transversely to the left face , but is tangent to all other faces . from this",
    "we can deduce the claim . indeed , one simply needs to check that each operator @xmath683 lifts to an operator on @xmath552 of the form @xmath689 where @xmath690 acts tangentially along @xmath567 and which differentiates transversely to @xmath571 in such a way that it annihilates the leading terms of the expansion there so that the resulting index set remains nonnegative . for example , examining the action along @xmath571 , @xmath264 kills the leading term @xmath691 , and the derivative of the next term @xmath692 is still bounded ; for the action of @xmath265 , we note that the leading coefficient @xmath693 of @xmath694 is independent of @xmath93 , so this term is also good ; a similar case by case check ensures that the lifts of all the @xmath499 have the appropriate properties .",
    "when @xmath483 , we have a bit more leeway since the expansion along @xmath571 still has leading term @xmath691 , but the next term is @xmath695 .",
    "therefore , we can also act on this with @xmath495 , @xmath496 and @xmath497 and still produce an operator with nonnegative index sets .",
    "we remark that donaldson only checks the boundedness of the operators @xmath696 for @xmath697 , and then uses that @xmath698 is a combination of @xmath142 and the other @xmath699 .",
    "our approach , however , shows that the operators @xmath501 are bounded , and when @xmath483 , produces the simpler result that every @xmath502 is bounded on @xmath313 ; in other words , in this case , _ all _ wedge second derivatives of any @xmath530 lie in @xmath313 .",
    "the previous subsections consist of little more than a lot of terminology and the statements of basic results about edge operators , but once these are given , the actual proof of proposition  [ mainlinearprop ] is immediate .",
    "article @xcite seems to give a more elementary proof of this same conclusion in the case of @xmath268 , and it is worth saying a bit more about the similarities and differences between the approaches , as well as the advantages of each .    we have already commented on the two different , but eventually equivalent , methods for constructing the kernel @xmath544 .",
    "there is perhaps little to recommend one method over the other .",
    "the other two steps of the argument in @xcite are in some sense inverted relative to the development here .",
    "our parametrix construction is simply a systematic way to pass from the polyhomogeneous structure of the model inverse @xmath544 to the corresponding structure for the actual inverse @xmath439 .",
    "this requires a certain amount of technical overhead , but the benefit is that one obtains the polyhomogeneous structure of @xmath439 itself , which can be quite useful .",
    "the hlder boundedness for @xmath439 and @xmath544 are then deduced from the same general result about boundedness of edge pseudodifferential operators . as we explained earlier ,",
    "this in turn can be reduced by scaling to the boundedness of ordinary pseudodifferential operators on ordinary hlder spaces .",
    "this takes advantage of the approximate homogeneity structure of these operators and of the edge function spaces .",
    "donaldson s argument , by contrast , first establishes the hlder estimates for the model operator @xmath544 using scaling arguments .",
    "he then briefly notes that these estimates can be patched together to obtain the hlder estimates for the differentiated kernels @xmath700 .",
    "thus the core difference between the approaches is that the patching ( or transition from the model to the actual inverse ) is done either at the level of the parametrix in the first approach , but only at the level of a priori estimates in the second .",
    "we now use the machinery of the last section to prove one of our main results , that under reasonable initial hypotheses , solutions of the complex monge - ampere equation are polyhomogeneous ( theorem [ phgmainthm ] ) .",

    "the proof here is close to the one in this last reference .",

    "the first step is equivalent to standard higher elliptic regularity for monge - ampere equations ; this uses the dilation invariance properties of the edge hlder spaces in a crucial way .",
    "the second step then breaks this dilation invariance by showing that we may also differentiate arbitrarily many times along @xmath6 .",
    "this uses the hybrid spaces introduced in  2.4 .",
    "the final step uses an iteration to show that @xmath28 has a longer and longer partial polyhomogeneous expansion .",
