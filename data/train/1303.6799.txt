    "sorting signed permutations by reversals ( or inversions as biologists call it ) is the first genome rearrangement model introduced in the scientific literature . the hypothesis that reversals change the order and orientation of genes ",
    "so - called genetic factors in that time  arose in a paper published in 1921 @xcite and implicitly was verified by microscopic inferring of chromosomes a couple of decades later @xcite . in the same time",
    ", geneticists realized that `` the mathematical properties of series of letters subjected to the operation of successive inversions do not appear to be worked out '' @xcite .",
    "this computational problem has been rediscovered at the end of the xx .",
    "century , and the solution to it , now called as the hannenhalli - pevzner theorem has been published in 1995 and 1999 @xcite .    the hannenhalli - pevzner theorem gives a polynomial running time algorithm to find one scenario with the minimum number of reversals necessary to sort a signed permutation .",
    "however , there might be multiple solutions , and the number of solutions typically grows exponentially with the length of the permutation .",
    "therefore , a(n almost ) uniform sampler is required which gives a set of solutions from which statistical properties of the solutions can be calculated .",
    "a typical approach for sampling is the markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "it starts with an arbitrary solution , and applies random perturbations on it thus exploring the solution space . in case of most parsimonious reversal sorting scenarios ,",
    "two approaches are considered as perturbing the current solution :    * the first approach encodes the most parsimonious reversal sorting scenarios with the intermediate permutations visited .",
    "then it cuts out a random window from this path , and gives a random new sorting scenario between the permutations at the beginning and end of the window * the second approach encodes the scenarios with the series of mutations applied , and perturbs them in a sophisticated way , described in details later in this paper .",
    "a markov chain for sampling purposes should fulfill two conditions : * ( a ) * it must converge to the uniform distributions of all possibilities , and a necessary condition for it that it must be irreducible , namely , from any solution the chain must be able to get to any another solution and * ( b ) * the convergence must be fast .",
    "the problem with the first approach mentioned above is that it is provenly slowly mixing @xcite .",
    "this means that the necessary number of steps in the markov chain to get sufficiently close to the uniform distribution grows exponentially with the length of the size of the permutation .",
    "therefore this approach is not applicable in practice .",
    "the problem with the second approach is that we even do not know if it is irreducible , nor that it is rapidly mixing . in this paper , we want to take a step towards proving that it is an irreducible markov chain .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ sec : pre ] , we define the problem of sorting by reversals , and the combinatorics tools necessary : the graph of desire and reality and the overlap graph .",
    "then we introduce the pressing game on the black - and - white graphs , and show that they correspond to the shortest reversal scenarios in case of a biologically important subset of permutations .",
    "we finish the section for stating the pressing game conjecture .",
    "if this was proven then this would give a proof for the irreducibility of the markov chain applying the above mentioned second approach . in section  [ sec :",
    "proof ] , we prove the conjecture for linear graphs",
    ". the paper is finished with a discussion and conclusions .",
    "a _ signed permutation _ is a permutation of numbers from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where each number has a @xmath5or @xmath6 sign .    while the number of @xmath4 long permutations is @xmath7 , the number of @xmath4 long signed permutations is @xmath8 .",
    "a _ reversal _ takes any consecutive part of a signed permutation and change both the order of the numbers and the sign of each number .",
    "it is also allowed that a reversal takes only one single number from the signed permutations , in that case , it changes the sign of this number .",
    "for example , the following reversal flips the @xmath9 segment :    @xmath10    the sorting by reversals problem asks for the minimum number of reversals necessary to transform a signed permutation into the identity permutation , ie .",
    "the signed permutation @xmath11 .",
    "this number is called the reversal distance , and the reversal distance of a signed permutation @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 . to solve this problem",
    ", we have to introduce two discrete mathematical objects , the graph of desire and reality and the overlap graph .",
    "the graph of desire and reality is a drawn graph , ie .",
    "not only the topology ( which vertices are connected ) but also its drawing matter .",
    "the overlap graph is a graph in terms of standard graph theory .",
    "the graph of desire and reality of a signed permutation can be constructed in the following way .",
    "each signed number is replaced with two unsigned number , @xmath14 becomes @xmath15 , @xmath16 becomes @xmath17 .",
    "the so - obtained @xmath18 long permutation is framed between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "each number including @xmath19 and @xmath20 will represent one vertex in the graph of desire and reality .",
    "they are drawn in the same order as they appear in the permutation , so the graph of desire and reality is not only a graph , its drawing is also important .",
    "we index the positions of the vertices starting with @xmath3 , and each pair of vertices in positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are connected with an edge .",
    "we call these edges the reality edges .",
    "each pair of vertices for numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are connected with an arc , and they are named the desire edges .",
    "the explanation for these names is that the reality edges describes what we see in the current permutation , and the desire edges tell what neighbors we would like to see to get the @xmath25 permutation : we would like that @xmath3 be next to @xmath19 , @xmath26 be next to @xmath27 , etc .",
    "the overlap graph is constructed from the graph of desire and reality in the following way .",
    "the vertices of the overlap graph are the desire edges in the graph of desire and reality .",
    "the vertices are colored , a vertex in the overlap graph is black if the number of vertices below the desire edge it represents in the graph of desire and reality is odd .",
    "a vertex is white if the number of vertices is even .",
    "two vertices are connected if the intervals that the corresponding desire edges span overlap but neither contain the other . on figure",
    "[ fig : example ] , we give an example for the graph of desire and reality and overlap graph .",
    "the overlap graph might fall into components .",
    "a vertex , as well as its corresponding desire edge is called oriented if the vertex is black , namely , the corresponding desire edge spans odd number of vertices .",
    "a vertex and its corresponding desire edge is unoriented if the vertex is white .",
    "a component is called oriented if it contains at least one black vertex , if the component contains only white vertices , it is called unoriented .",
    "a component is non - trivial if it contains more than one vertex .",
    "some of the non - trivial unoriented components are hurdles .",
    "we skip the precise definition of hurdles here as we do not need it .",
    "a permutation is called fortress , if the number of its hurdles is odd , with some prescribed properties , also not detailed here .",
    "any reversal changes the topology of the graph of desire and reality on two reality vertices .",
    "any desire edge is a neighbor of two reality edges , and we say that the reversal acts on this desire edge if it changes the topology on the two neighbor reality edges .    how do such reversals change the graph of desire and reality and thus the overlap graph ? we set up a lemma below explaining this .",
    "[ lem : press ] let @xmath1 be an orientd desire edge on which the reversal acts .",
    "then the reversal    * change the orientation of any desire edge crossing @xmath1 * change the overlap of any pair of desire edges crossing @xmath1 * the desire edge itself become an unoriented edge without any overlap with any other edges .",
    "the reversal flips one of the legs of each overlapping desire edge , namely , the reality edge connected to the desire edge .",
    "therefore it changes the parity of the vertices below the desire edge and thus the orientation of it .",
    "two edges which are both overlap with @xmath1 but not with each other , can overlap only from the two ends of @xmath1 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : click ] , case * i*. a reversal acting on @xmath1 will flip one - one of their endpoints , so they will indeed overlap .",
    "if two edges overlap with @xmath1 , but by definition not with each other since the interval of one of them contains the interval of the other , then they come from one end of @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to see that after the reversal they will overlap by definition , see fig .",
    "[ fig : click ] , case * ii*. it is also easy to see that overlapping pair of edges which are also overlap with each other are the cases on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : click ] , so after the reversal , they will not overlap .",
    "finally , the oriented edge on which the reversal acts becomes an unoriented edge forming a small cycle with a reality edge , and thus it can not overlap with any other desire edge .",
    "this lemma also shows the connection between sorting by reversals and the pressing game on black and white graphs : a pressing of a black vertex is equivalent with a reversal acting on the corresponding desire edge .",
    "below we define the pressing game on black - and - white graphs :    given a graph @xmath0 with its vertices colored with black and white .",
    "any black vertex @xmath1 can be pressed , which has the following effect : ( a ) all neighbors of @xmath1 change color , white neighbors become black and _ vice versa _ , ( b ) all pair of neighbors of @xmath1 change connectivity , connected pairs become unconnected , unconnected ones become connected , ( c ) and finally , @xmath1 becomes a separated white vertex .",
    "the aim of the game is to transform @xmath2 into an all white , empty graph .",
    "if each component of @xmath2 contains at least one black vertex , then the pressing game always has at least one solution , as it turns out from the hannenhalli - pevzner theorem .    *",
    "( hannenhalli - pevzner ) , @xcite * @xmath28 where @xmath4 is the length of the permutation @xmath12 , @xmath29 is the number of cycles in the graph of desire and reality , @xmath30 is the number of hurdles in the permutation and @xmath31 is the fortress indicator , it is @xmath3 if the permutation is a fortress , otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to see that any reversal can increase the number of cycles in the graph of desire and reality at most by @xmath3 , hence the hannenhalli - pevzner theorem also says if a permutation does not contain any hurdle ( and thus it is not a fortress ) then any optimal reversal sorting path increases the number of cycles to @xmath32 without creating any hurdle . below",
    "we state this theorem .",
    "[ theo : safe - reversal ] let @xmath12 be a permutation which is not the identical permutation and whose overlap graph does not contain any non - trivial unoriented component .",
    "then a reversal exists that acts on an oriented desire edge , thus increases @xmath29 by @xmath3 and does not create any non - trivial unoriented component .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath2 is an arbitrary black - and - white graph such that each component contains at least one black vertex , then at least one black vertex can be pressed without making a non - trivial unoriented component .",
    "the proof can be found in @xcite , and we skip it here .",
    "the proof consider only the overlap graph , and in fact , it indeed works for every black - and - white graph .",
    "a clear consequence is the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath2 be a black - and - white graph such that each component on it contains at least one black vertex .",
    "then @xmath2 can be transformed into the all - white empty graph in the pressing game .",
    "it is sufficient to use iteratively theorem  [ theo : safe - reversal ] . indeed , according to theorem  [ theo : safe - reversal ] , we can find a black vertex @xmath1 , such that pressing it does not create a non - trivial all - white component , on the other hand , @xmath1 become a separated white vertex , and it will remain a separated white vertex afterward . hence , the number of vertices in non - trivial components decreases at least by one , and in a finite number of steps , @xmath2 is transformed into the all - white , empty graph .",
    "consider the set of vertices as an alphabet , any sequence over this alphabet is called a pressing path .",
    "it is a valid pressing path when each vertex is black when it is pressed , and it is successful , if it is valid and leads to the all - white , empty graph . the length of the pressing path is the number of vertices pressed in it . the following theorem is also true .",
    "let @xmath2 be a black - and - white graph such that each component on it contains at least one black vertex .",
    "then each successful pressing path of @xmath2 has the same length .",
    "the proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "we are ready to state the pressing path conjecture .",
    "let @xmath2 be a black - and - white graph such that each component on it contains at least one black vertex .",
    "construct a metagraph , @xmath33 whose vertices are the successful pressing paths on @xmath2 .",
    "connect two vertices if the length of the longest common subsequence of the pressing paths they represent is at most @xmath34 less than the common length of the pressing paths .",
    "the conjecture is that @xmath33 is connected .",
    "the conjecture means that with small alterations , we can transform any pressing path into any other pressing path , whatever @xmath2 is .",
    "the small alteration means that we remove at most @xmath34 , not necessary consecutive vertices from a pressing path , and add at most @xmath34 vertices , not necessarily to the same places where the old vertices were removed from , and not necessarily to consecutive places .",
    "although it is generally not true that only the pressing paths are the reversal sorting paths of a signed permutation , as there might be cycle - increasing reversals not acting on a desire edge , for a class of permutations , it is true . specially , if a signed permutation is such that in its graph of desire and reality each cycle contains only one or two desire edges , then all cycle - increasing reversals act on desire edges .",
    "these signed permutations are the permutations that can be considered in the so - called infinite site model @xcite .    in this paper , we prove the pressing game conjecture for linear graphs . actually , we can prove more , the metagraph will be already connected if we require that neighbor vertices have longest common subsequence at most @xmath27 less than the common length of their pressing paths .",
    "the proof of our main theorem is recursive , and for this , we need the following notations . let @xmath2 be a black - and - white graph , and @xmath1 a black vertex in it .",
    "then @xmath35 denotes the graph we get by pressing vertex @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath36 is a valid pressing path of @xmath2 ( namely , each vertex is black when we want to press it , but @xmath36 does not necessary yield the all - white , empty graph ) , then @xmath37 denotes the graph we get after pressing all vertices in @xmath36 in the indicated order .",
    "finally , let @xmath38 denote the suffix of @xmath36 starting in position @xmath39 .",
    "the simplicity of the linear graphs is that they have a simple structure and furthermore , the pressing game on linear graphs is self - reducible as the following observation states .",
    "[ obs : self - red ] let @xmath2 be a linear black - and - white graph and @xmath1 a black vertex in it . then @xmath35 is also a linear graph and the separated white vertex @xmath1 .    since any separated white vertex does not have to be pressed again , it is sufficient to consider @xmath40 , which is a linear graph .",
    "we are ready to state and prove our main theorem .",
    "[ theo : main ] let @xmath2 be an arbitrary , finite , linear black - and - white graph , and let @xmath33 be the following graph .",
    "the vertices of @xmath33 are the successful pressing paths on @xmath2 , and two vertices are connected if the length of the longest common subsequence of the pressing paths they represent is at most @xmath27 less than the common length of the pressing paths . then @xmath33 is connected .",
    "it is sufficient to show that for any successful pressing paths @xmath41 and @xmath42 there is a series @xmath43 such that for any @xmath44 , the length of the longest common subsequence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is at most @xmath27 less than the common length of the paths , and @xmath47 starts with @xmath48 . indeed , then both @xmath47 and @xmath49 starts with @xmath48 , and both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are successful pressing paths on @xmath52 .",
    "we can use the induction to transform @xmath47 into a pressing path which starts @xmath53 , then we consider its suffix which is a successful pressing path on @xmath54 , etc .    furthermore ,",
    "to show that @xmath48 can be moved to the first position to the current pressing path , it is sufficient to show that it can be moved towards the first position with some series of allowed alterations of the path .",
    "the first question is if @xmath48 is in @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath41 is a successful pressing path of @xmath2 and @xmath48 is a black vertex in @xmath2 ( since it is the first vertex in the valid pressing path @xmath49 ) .",
    "then either @xmath48 is pressed or it become a separated white vertex by pressing a neighbor of @xmath48 . since @xmath2 is a linear graph , the only possibility for",
    "the later case is that the remaining linear part of @xmath2 contains two vertices : @xmath48 and some @xmath55 , both of them are black and connected , and @xmath55 is pressed in the pressing path . but then pressing @xmath48 instead of @xmath55 has the same effect . replacing @xmath55 to @xmath48 in the pressing path",
    "means that the length of the longest common subsequence is one less than the common length of the paths .",

    "however , @xmath48 is black in @xmath2 , since it is the first vertex in the valid pressing path @xmath49 . then there have to be at least one vertex in @xmath57 that made @xmath48 white .",
    "let @xmath65 be the last such vertex in @xmath57 , and let we denote @xmath66 .",
    "we claim that none of the vertices in @xmath67 are neighbors of @xmath65 in @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , if there were a neighbor of @xmath65 in @xmath67 , denote it by @xmath69 , then @xmath69 would become a neighbor of @xmath48 after pressing @xmath65 , and then pressing @xmath69 would make @xmath48 black , and then either @xmath48 was black before pressing @xmath59 , a contradiction , or there were further vertices in @xmath67 making @xmath1 white , contradicting that @xmath65 is the last such vertex . since @xmath67 does not contain a vertex which is a neighbor of @xmath65 in @xmath68 , we can recursively bubble down @xmath65 next to @xmath59 .",
    "we get that the pressing path is now @xmath70 , where @xmath57 is now a different pressing path , and possibly empty , and @xmath58 might also be empty . the topology and the colors of @xmath65 , @xmath59 and @xmath48 in @xmath64 is one of the following :        _ case 2a_. assume that @xmath71 is not empty , then the @xmath72 triplet has at least one neighbor , call it @xmath55 , and @xmath55 either is pressed in @xmath71 , or we can replace a vertex in @xmath71 with @xmath55 such that it is still a successful pressing path on @xmath73 .",
    "so we can assume that at least one neighbor of the @xmath72 triplet is pressed in @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to see that the neighbors of the @xmath74 triplet changes their color in the same way by pressing only @xmath48 and pressing @xmath75 , see figure  [ fig : alter ] .",
    "therefore we can press @xmath48 instead of @xmath76 , and the pressing path @xmath71 will be still valid up to the point when @xmath77 or @xmath78 is pressed .",
    "assume that @xmath77 is pressed before @xmath78 in @xmath71 , and @xmath79 figure  [ fig : finishing2a ] shows that the color of @xmath78 and a possible second neighbor of @xmath77 denoted by @xmath80 will be the same in @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore @xmath83 will be also a successful pressing path on @xmath2 , since no more vertices are affected by the given alteration of the pressing path .",

    "indeed , it is generally true that if a vertex @xmath1 is not in a successful pressing path @xmath36 , then a successful pressing path @xmath88 exists which contains @xmath1 and the length of the longest common subsequence of @xmath36 and @xmath88 is only @xmath3 less than their common length .",

    "the only missing part is case 2b , which seems to be very complicated for general graphs .",
    "a stronger theorem holds for the linear case that is conjectured for the general case .",
    "one possible direction above proving the general conjecture is to study the emerging markov chain on the solution space of the pressing game on linear graphs .",
    "we proved that a markov chain that randomly removes two vertices from the current pressing path , adds two random vertices to it , and accepts it if the result is a successful pressing path is irreducible .",
