    "phase transitions and in particular the melting transition is one of the most fundamental problems in condensed matter and statistical physics .",
    "the most intensively studied model system is the one consisting of charged particles with a pure spherical symmetric repulsive inter  particle interaction ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "examples are the electron wigner solid , colloidal spheres and dusty plasmas . after the discovery of the wigner crystallisation of electrons above the surface of liquid helium by grimes and adams @xcite the interest in the melting of low dimensional systems has increased .",
    "recently the layered close - packed crystalline structure and their structural transition were observed in experiments with dust rf discharge @xcite and with ion layered crystals in ion traps @xcite .",
    "motivated by the theoretical works of nelson , halperin @xcite , and young @xcite who developed a theory for a two stage continuous melting of a two dimensional ( 2d ) crystal and which was based on ideas of berenzinskii @xcite , kosterlitz and thouless @xcite , several experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite were devoted to the melting transition of mainly single layer crystals . in this case",
    "the hexagonal lattice is the most energetically favored structure for potentials of the form @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the dimensionality of the system on the melting transition is another important issue which has been investigated recently .",
    "an important subsystem in this field is the bilayer system consisting of two parallel layers of charged particles with a pure repulsive inter - particle interaction .",
    "the interlayer distance is an additional variable with which the effective interparticle interaction can be altered .",
    "while the classical single layer can crystallise only in a hexagonal lattice it was found that the bilayer system exhibits a much richer structural phase diagram .",
    "previously , the different types of lattices and structural transitions in a multilayer crystal at zero temperature with parabolic lateral confinement was analysed in @xcite .",
    "different classes of lattices of the double - layer crystal were specified in @xcite as function of the interlayer spacing and electron density .",
    "a systematic study of the stability and the phonon spectra of these crystal phases was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the collective modes of the corresponding bilayer liquid state was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the extension of the classical bilayer model to the finite vertical coupled classical dot system was presented in ref.@xcite where a rich collection of structural first and second order phase transitions was found .",
    "the quantum bilayer system was investigated by several groups @xcite .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the melting of the classical bilayer crystal and study the influence of the different crystal structures on the melting temperature .",
    "the equilibrium states of a bilayer crystal at different temperatures ( @xmath2 ) will be investigated using the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation technique .",
    "preliminary resuls of this study were published in @xcite .",
    "the melting of the classical bilayer crystal was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using the lindemann criterion where the mean square displacement was calculated within the harmonic approximation .",
    "it is well - known that the harmonic approximation can only give a rough estimate of the melting temperature .",
    "for example , for the single electron layer using the kosterlitz ",
    "young ( kthny ) theory and inserting the lam coefficients of the @xmath3 lattice one obtains @xmath4 , while inclusion of non linear effects , using monte - carlo simulations @xcite , results into @xmath5 which compares to the experimental result @xmath6 ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this is the motivation to go beyond the harmonic approximation and to investigate the importance of non linear effects on the melting temperature .",
    "using the monte carlo simulation technique has the added advantage that information can be obtained about the topology of the defects which are responsible for melting .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows .",
    "the model system and the numerical approach is given in sec.ii . in sec .",
    "iii we construct the solid  liquid phase diagram for coulomb bilayer crystals . in sec .",
    "iv the influence of screening on melting is studied and we formulate a new criterion for the melting temperature . in sec .",
    "v we show that it gives accurate results for the melting temperature when we use the new melting criterion and the harmonic approximation .",
    "the existence of hysteresis during melting of the 2d single layer crystal is considered in sec .",
    "the topology of defects in the hexagonal type crystal is considered in sec .",
    "the gallery of defects for the square bilayer crystal is presented in sec .",
    "our results are summarised in sec .",
    "in the present study we limit ourselves to infinitely thin bilayers with equal density , @xmath7 , of charged particles in the two layers . in the crystal phase the particles",
    "are arranged in two parallel layers in the @xmath8plane which are a distance @xmath9 apart in the @xmath10direction .",
    "the lattice structure in the top and bottom layers are the same , but the particle sites in opposite layers are staggered ( i.e. closed - packing system ) .",
    "a single layer crystal is a limiting case of a bilayer crystal with @xmath11 and particle density @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the particles interact through an isotropic coulomb or screened repulsive potential @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the particle charge , @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the medium the particles are moving in , @xmath16 the position of the particle with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the screening length .",
    "the type of lattice symmetry at @xmath3 depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mean interparticle distance . for the classical coulomb system ( @xmath21 ) at @xmath22 there are two dimensionless parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 which determine the state of the system .",
    "the classical yukawa system ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath22 is characterised by three independent dimensionless parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "below we measure the temperature in units of @xmath28 and the energy in @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we will also consider the melting of a single layer crystal with a lennard - jones ( @xmath30 ) inter - particle potential and with a @xmath0 repulsive potential as well .    in our simulations",
    "the density of particles @xmath12 remains the same for all interlayer distances @xmath23 while the interlayer distance changes .",
    "the initial symmetry of the structure is set by the primitive vectors , the values of which are derived from a calculation of the minimal energy configuration for fixed @xmath23 at @xmath3 using the ewald method @xcite . in our numerical calculations we took a fragment of lattice ( ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 particles ) and used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the structure and potential energy of the system at @xmath22 are found by the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite in which at some temperature the next simulation state of the system is obtained by a random displacement of one of the particles .",
    "if the new configuration has a smaller energy it is accepted and if the new energy is larger the configuration is accepted if @xmath33 , where the probability @xmath34 with @xmath35 the increment in the energy and @xmath36 is a random number between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we allow the system to approach its equilibrium state at some temperature @xmath2 , after executing @xmath39 ` mc steps ' .",
    "the potential energy at @xmath22 is found by summation over all particles and their periodic images using the ewald method @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was found that the bilayer coulomb crystal at @xmath3 exhibits five different lattices as function of the interlayer distance : @xmath40hexagonal , @xmath41rectangular , @xmath42square , @xmath43rhombic , and @xmath44hexagonal .",
    "it should be noted that the behaviour of the system near the melting point is essentially non - linear and therefore the melting temperature obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite has only qualitative predictive power .",
    "therefore , we revise the melting phase diagram and present a more accurate calculation of it , by performing mc simulation of the melting transition .    we use different criteria to find the critical melting temperature .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mean square displacement of the particles from their equilibrium positions was introduced in @xcite to characterise the system order .",
    "it is well  known that @xmath47 diverges for a 2d system .",
    "we will use a modified parameter @xmath48 as introduced in ref.@xcite , which enables us to minimize the system size effect which gives significant contributions in the usual parameter @xmath47 . for the modified parameter @xmath49",
    ", @xmath50 is defined by the difference in the mean square displacement of neighboring particles from their initial sites @xmath51 and can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 means averaging over mc steps , the index @xmath54 denotes the @xmath55 nearest neighbours of particle @xmath56 in the upper or in the bottom layers . for the hexagonal lattice @xmath57 , while for rectangular , square and rhombic lattices @xmath58 .    for sufficiently low temperatures the particles exibit harmonic oscillations around their @xmath3 equilibrium position , and",
    "the oscillation amplitude increases linearly with temperature , which leads to a linear increase of @xmath48 with @xmath2 .",
    "13(a ) show the modifies parameter @xmath48 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath59 : i ) for the hexagonal single layer crystal ( @xmath60 ) ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , ii ) for the bilayer crystal with a square lattice ( @xmath61 ) ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , and iii ) for a hexagonal type bilayer crystal ( @xmath62 ) ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . at higher temperatures non - linear effects are important and",
    "@xmath48 becomes a nonlinear function of @xmath2 .",
    "the particle oscillation amplitude increases faster than linear with @xmath2 , but the system is not melted , since the particles display still an ordered structure .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath48 with @xmath2 is a manifestation of the anharmonicity of the motion of the particles .",
    "melting occurs when @xmath48 increases very sharply with @xmath2 . in our previous study @xcite we assumed that melting occurs when @xmath63 as was obtained from numerical simulations of melting in a single layer crystal @xcite . from the present study we find that @xmath63 is not a good criterion for melting , except for the case @xmath60 while for @xmath61 and @xmath62 the system",
    "is still ordered when @xmath64 .",
    "note , that we defined @xmath49 , where @xmath65 is the mean inter - particle distance for a single layer crystal with density @xmath12 , for all interlayer distances @xmath23 . in the case",
    "when @xmath66 and the inter  layer particle interaction is negligible small , we obtain @xmath67 at melting because now the particle density in each layer is @xmath68 times smaller .    as a second independent parameter from which we determine the melting temperature we calculated the height of the first peak in the pair correlation function as function of temperature .",
    "the pair correlation function is calculated for the particles in one of the layers ( see fig .",
    "this is shown in fig .  4 for an interlayer separation @xmath61 and three different temperatures .",
    "the height of the first peak in @xmath69 is plotted as function of temperature in figs .",
    "1 - 3(b ) for @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the value of the first peak of the pair correlation function decreases with increasing temperature , and exhibits a quick decrease at @xmath71 .",
    "this is most pronounced for the case of a single layer crystal ( fig .",
    "even in the liquid phase the pair correlation function still has a peak structure due to the local inter - particle correlation . in fig  4 the state of the system just before melting",
    "is denoted by the doted curve and the dashed curve refers to the state after melting .    in the crystalline state the potential energy of",
    "the system increases almost linearly with temperature and only a weak non linear @xmath2-dependence is observed . at larger temperature a quick rise in the energy is clearly seen in figs .",
    "1 - 3(c ) denoting the beginning of melting and is related to the unbinding of dislocation pairs , which we will discuss below . at melting the potential energy",
    "has a very steep rise .",
    "the heat capacity of a 2d structure is determined by @xmath72 , where the total energy @xmath73 includes the kinetic and potential energy .",
    "the heat capacity of the crystal and the liquid phases near melting are very close to each other in two dimensions , and the first derivative of the energy with respect to t taken in the crystal phase and the liquid phase are practically the same .",
    "the potential energy decreases with increasing @xmath23 which is a consequence of the decreasing inter - layer coulomb interaction .",
    "note , that the potential energy difference between the liquid and solid phases near melting for the square bilayer crystal at @xmath61 is of size @xmath74 which is about a factor 2 larger than for a hexagonal lattice , i.e. at @xmath60 , @xmath75 , and at @xmath62 , @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , as follows from the temperature behaviour of the parameter @xmath48 , the peak of the pair correlation function and the potential energy , the square lattice turns out to exibit a substantial higher melting temperature , and consequently is more stable against thermal fluctuations , than the hexagonal one .",
    "the enhanced stability of the square lattice can be understood from an analysis of the defects which are formed during melting and which will be discussed in secs .",
    "vii and viii .    in order to determine the type of melting transition and the melting point the bond  orientational and translational correlation functions",
    "are calculated @xcite which sometimes can also be obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "but our finite fragment of 780 particles ( with periodic boundary conditions ) is too small for a reliable analysis of the asymptotic decay of the density correlation functions .",
    "therefore , we calculate the bond  angular order factor @xmath77 which originally was introduced by halperin and nelson @xcite .",
    "for each layer ( @xmath78 ) we define the bond - angular order factor @xmath79 and the translational order factor @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the angle between some fixed axis and the vector which connects the @xmath54th particle and its nearest @xmath12th neighbour , and @xmath82 is a reciprocal  lattice vector .",
    "the latter we took equal to the smallest reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the total bond - angular order factor of the bilayer crystal is defined as @xmath83 and similar for @xmath84 .",
    "these order factors are shown in figs .",
    "1 - 3(d ) as function of temperature . for low temperatures",
    "the factors @xmath85 ( solid circles ) and @xmath84 ( open circles ) decrease linearly with @xmath2 , and when @xmath77 reaches @xmath86 , both order factors drop quickly to zero at the same temperature as seen in figs .  1 - 3(d ) . from the behaviour of the order factors we can derive the temperature at which order",
    "is lost in the system .",
    "our numerical results show that the bond - order angular order factor : 1 ) decreases linearly with increasing temperature , except very close to the melting temperature , where it decreases faster , and 2 ) it drops to zero just after it reaches the value of 0.45 .",
    "in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "5 we show the melting temperature as a function of @xmath23 , which is the interlayer distance for fixed particle density . all criteria mentioned above gave the same temperature @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath60 we obtained the critical @xmath88 , resulting in @xmath89 .",
    "this critical value was first measured in ref.@xcite and found to be @xmath90 .",
    "later experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite gave critical @xmath91 within this range . as seen in fig .",
    "5 the hexagonal ( i and v ) , the rectangular ( ii ) and rhombic ( iv ) lattices melt at almost the same temperature .",
    "this implies that the inter - layer correlation does not strongly influence the melting temperature , although it determines which lattice structure is stable and has the lowest energy .",
    "note , however that the melting temperature for phase iv and v are slightly smaller than the corresponding temperature for phases i and ii in the given @xmath92 range .",
    "we checked that in the limit @xmath93 @xmath94 , which is reached for @xmath95 .",
    "the general shape of the phase diagramm agrees with the one obtained earlier @xcite using the lindemann criterion where the mean square displacement was calculated within the harmonic approximation .",
    "but there are several important differences : 1 ) the absolute value of the melting temperature was underestimated in ref.@xcite by about a factor of @xmath96 ; 2 ) at the second - order structural phase transition points the melting temperature becomes zero wich was a consequence of the softening of a phonon mode at @xmath3 . with the present monte - carlo simulations we find @xmath97 which is due to the importance of non - linear effects ; 3 ) in ref.@xcite the maximum melting temperature in phase ii was larger than the one in phase iii ( square lattice ) which is opposite to what is found in the present calculation ; and 4 ) the melting temperature in phase iv was smaller than in phase v for @xmath98 , which is opposite to the present results .    for the square bilayer crystal ( iii ) the melting temperature increases with rising @xmath23 and only for @xmath99 we found that @xmath87 starts to decrease with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "it is surprising that the square lattice bilayer crystal has the maximal melting temperature @xmath100 which exceeds the critical temperature of the single layer crystal @xmath101 , where the particle density is two times larger .",
    "the most stable square lattice bilayer occurs at @xmath61 which results into the critical coupling parameter @xmath102 . in the present paper",
    "we will not discuss the temperature induced structural phase transition , but limit ourselves to the melting transition .",
    "we denote in fig .  5 the phase boundaries between the different crystal phases by vertical dotted lines .",
    "the analysis of the stability of the classical bilayer crystal was carried out in ref.@xcite using the harmonic approximation and it was found that near the structural phase transition the melting temperature was strongly reduced due to the softening of a phonon mode which may lead to a re  entrant behaviour .",
    "no such behaviour was found in the present monte - carlo simulaion . near the structural phase transition we found deformed lattice structures with a long wavelength deformation . at present",
    "we can not draw any definite conclusions from it and we need to simulate larger crystal fragments during more monte - carlo steps . but this observation does not influence our conclusions concerning the melting behaviour .",
    "symmetry of the lattice of the bilayer crystal at @xmath3 might depend not only on the interlayer distance , but also on the type of the inter - particle interaction .",
    "the phase diagram corresponding to the lowest energy lattice structures for a bilayer crystal at @xmath3 with screened coulomb inter - particle interaction is shown in fig .",
    "6 as function of the screening length @xmath103 .",
    "notice that the phase boundaries depend only weakly on the screening length . on the other hand ,",
    "the melting temperature reduces considerably with screening as is apparent from fig .  5 in the case @xmath104 ( solid circles ) and @xmath105 ( open triangles ) .",
    "the melting temperature of a single layer crystal with coulomb ( i.e. @xmath106 ) interaction is @xmath101 , with screened one is @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and for @xmath105 it is @xmath109 .",
    "note , that the bilayer crystal with screened inter ",
    "particle interaction has the same qualitative melting curve as the coulomb bilayer crystal ( see fig .  5 ) .    for the case of a screened coulomb interparticle interaction ( @xmath108 )",
    "the change of the potential energy with temperature as referred to the @xmath3 result is shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) for two different inter - layer distances .",
    "notice that the potential energy initially increases linearly with temperature but then near the melting temperature it rises quickly within a very narrow temperatures range .",
    "it is apparent that the square lattice bilayer crystal ( @xmath110 ) has an enhanced melting temperature as compared to the hexagonal lattice ( i.e. @xmath60 ) .",
    "the system looses order just after the bond  angular order factor reaches the value @xmath86 as is apparent from fig .",
    "also , for the screened coulomb interaction the square bilayer lattice exibites an enhanced melting temperature .    from the present numerical results for @xmath85 for a screened coulomb interaction and from previous section for a pure coulomb interaction for single and bilayer lattices we formulate a new criterion for melting which we believe is universal : _",
    "melting occurs when the bond - angle correlation factor becomes @xmath111_. we also checked the validity of this criterion for a single layer crystal with a lennard - jones @xmath112 and a repulsive @xmath113 interaction potential . the results for the translational and the bond  angular factors for single and bilayer systems and for different inter - particle interactions are shown in fig .",
    "8 as function of the ratio @xmath114 .",
    "these results confirm the universality of the proposed criterion .",
    "it is valid for single and bilayer systems and we believe it is also independent of the functional form of the inter - particle interaction .",
    "given the fact that the bond - order angular order factor decreases almost linearly with increasing temperature , and melting occurs when the bond  angular order factor equals @xmath86 we will calculate the melting temperature within the harmonic approximation .",
    "therefore , we reformulate the definition of the angular - bond order factor within the harmonic approximation in terms of eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of the @xmath3 phonon spectrum . previously such a method was used in ref.@xcite in the calculation of the modified lindemann parameter for a finite cluster and in ref.@xcite for the bilayer system . in the present paper",
    "we apply the same algorithm in the calculation of the bond angular order parameter .",
    "we consider a finite crystal fragment with periodic boundary conditions and diagonalize numerically the corresponding hessian matrix .",
    "the theoretical background can be shortly described as follows .",
    "any thermodynamically averaged observable which is a functional of the particles coordinates @xmath115 can be written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a multidimensional vector describing the system coordinates and @xmath118 is the potential energy . within a standard linear approach we expand both @xmath119 and @xmath120 near the equilibrium state @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , and obtain @xmath123 the multidimensional integration can be performed after diagonalisation of the hessian matrix which has the elements @xmath124 and after introduction of the normal mode coordinates .",
    "thus within the harmonic approach the angular  bond order factor is given by the following expression @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 are the eigenfrequencies and the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix formed by the second derivative of the potential energy ; the indices @xmath128 , @xmath129 refer to the nearest neighbours of the particles @xmath12 , @xmath78 , respectively , where the summation is performed over all particles .",
    "the first three eigenmodes have @xmath130 and correspond to the center - of - mass motion and rotation of the system as a whole which we removed from the summation in eq .",
    "the melting temperature is then obtained by taking @xmath131 equal to the value @xmath86 .",
    "the obtained results are shown in fig .  9 by the solid curves for the square lattice ( fig .",
    "9(a ) ) as function of the interlayer distance and the hexagonal ( fig .",
    "9(b ) ) lattice ( @xmath60 ) as function of the screening length .",
    "thus using our new criterion together with the harmonic approximation reproduces @xmath87 rather well and agrees with our mc calculations within @xmath132 for @xmath133 in the case of the square lattice .",
    "near the structural transition the harmonic approximation underestimates the melting temperature due to the softening of the @xmath3 phonon modes ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting questions in the field of phase transitions is whether or not there is a hysteresis behaviour at melting and freezing of the crystal structure .",
    "even if such an hysteresis is found it can be an artefact of the numerical simulation arising from the fact that the equilibrium state of the system is not reached . to shed light on this problem we studied more carefully the melting of the single layer crystal in the temperature range where a rapid increase of the potential energy was found @xmath134 , ( see fig .",
    "we took very small temperature increments of @xmath135 .",
    "at the temperature @xmath136 , which is just below the melting point , during numerical annealing of the system which lasts for @xmath137 mc steps , the potential energy practically remains the same and changes only with @xmath138 of the total energy jump @xmath139 .",
    "note , that the monte - carlo ` time ' step is about a factor 10 larger than that in typical molecular dynamic calculations . at the melting temperature",
    "@xmath140 the energy rises rapidly during @xmath141 mc steps , and then the system remains in the liquid state during @xmath142 mc steps .",
    "we also found such a state of the system at the intermediate temperature @xmath143 when the system switches from solid to liquid and back as function of the simulation time .",
    "the system exhibits a network of grain boundary defects which makes it possible for the system to get back to a defect - free structure at the same temperature ( see fig .",
    "such a type of equilibrium behavior of the system at the critical point was found earlier by morf @xcite .",
    "the potential energy of the system at this temperature and the order factors @xmath131 , @xmath84 are shown in fig .",
    "11 as function of the ` mc time ' .",
    "as function of time the system switches between the solid and liquid state where it looses and regains translational and orientational order .",
    "the existence of this state shows that there is a temperature range ( at least for a crystalline fragment of 448 particles ) in which the crystalline and liquid states have equal probability to occur and , consequently , no hysteresis occurs in the coulomb single layer crystal .",
    "it should be noted that the potential energy changes very rapidly , in an extreme narrow range of temperatures .",
    "whether or not this rapid rise is continuous or discontinuous is not yet clear .",
    "in this section we consider the topology of the defects which are created during melting of a single layer crystal . at low temperature",
    "the probability of defect creation is small and the lattice remains perfect . with rising @xmath2 the energy increases and the system can overpass some potential barrier and we found that during the mc simulation the system transits from one metastable state to another .",
    "the different metastable states differ by the appearance of isomers in the crystal structure which appear with different probabilities . in order to find these isomers in the equilibrium state of our system we choose , during our mc simulation , a number of instant particle configurations",
    ". then we quickly freeze each instant particle configuration which enables us to exclude the ` visual ' oscillation effect , i.e. the displacements of the particles from their lattice configurations due to thermal fluctuations . after freezing each configuration",
    "we find the topology and energy of the isomer and the bond - angular and the translational order factors of this crystal structure .",
    "the isomers at @xmath144 , which is a temperature just before melting , at @xmath145 which is just above melting , and at the intermediate temperature @xmath146 ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) , were obtained . each point in fig .",
    "12(a ) represents one configuration containing an isomer in a single layer ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "similar results are shown in fig .",
    "12(b ) for the square lattice bilayer system ( @xmath61 ) .    with rising temperature first",
    ", point defects such as a ` centered vacancy ' and a ` centered interstitial ' are created at @xmath147 .",
    "these calculated defects as obtained by freezing the instant particle configuration to zero temperature are shown in fig .",
    "13(a , b ) .",
    "point defects appear in pairs in our mc calculations , which are a consequence of the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the total energy of a non bounded pair consisting of a ` centered interstitial ' and a ` centered vacancy ' is @xmath148 .",
    "we checked the accuracy of this value on fragments of 512 and 780 particles which contain only one pair of ` centered interstitial ' and ` centered vacancy ' . in both cases the minimum energy of a pair of uncorrelated point defects was the same within @xmath149 .",
    "the quartet of bound disclinations ( two sevenfold and two fivefold ) also appear at this temperature ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) of ref.@xcite ) and has an energy @xmath150 . the point defects and disclinations bound into a quartet",
    "have only negligible effect on @xmath77 and @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "12(a ) , group 1 ) .",
    "the order factors of the ` cold ' configurations ( freezed to @xmath3 ) containing a ` centered interstitial ' and a ` centered vacancy ' equal @xmath151 and @xmath152 , ( see fig .",
    "it should be noted that in spite of prolonged annealing of the system during @xmath142 mc steps at a temperature @xmath136 , which is just below melting , we did not find more complex isomers than point defects and quartets of disclinations .    at the temperature @xmath140 , which is the melting temperature , ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) we find pairs of disclinations which are created by the dissociation of disclinations which were bound into a quartet ( see fig .",

    "angular order factor remains larger than the translational one . for the energy range @xmath155 ( group 3 )",
    "there are pairs of disclinations aggregating into chains , which are nothing else then grain boundaries ( see fig .",
    "10 ) which have the effect of rotating one part of the crystal with respect to another . in this case",
    ", both order factors become very small .",
    "these defects occur in the system at intermediate temperature @xmath156 when the system exhibits the remarkable property of switching between a quasi  liquid state and a crystalline state during our numerical simulation .",
