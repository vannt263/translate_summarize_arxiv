    "transiting planets are vital to our understanding of the structure of planetary systems , as they allow measurement of the radius of the planet , and the mass of the planet unambiguously when coupled with radial velocity data .",
    "this allows the density and surface gravity to be derived , and the internal structure of the planet may be inferred . on - going transit surveys such as superwasp @xcite ,",
    "hatnet @xcite and xo @xcite are now pushing the number of known transiting planets towards 60 .",
    "most of the transiting planets are hot jupiters , which produce a @xmath61% dip in the flux when transiting their host stars .",
    "however , an earth - sized planet will produce a dip of only @xmath7% , and expensive space - based transit surveys ( e.g. corot , kepler ) are required to reach this level of accuracy .    another method to detect earth - sized planets",
    "is through measuring transit timing variations ( ttv ) .",
    "a transiting planet will maintain a constant period whilst orbiting its host star , excluding tidal effects and general relativity .",
    "therefore , if we measure the time of mid - transit for a given system , and see variations from a constant period , we may conclude that there must be a third body in the system perturbing the orbit of the known transiting body @xcite .",
    "ttv is particularly sensitive when the third body is in a resonant orbit , in which case sub - earth mass planets may be detected .",
    "it is also sensitive to exomoons @xcite and trojans @xcite , and therefore has the potential to provide the first detection of an earth - mass body orbiting a main - sequence star other than our own .",
    "detecting earth - mass bodies in resonant orbits requires the central transit times to be measured to an accuracy of @xmath610 seconds , for which we need high precision light curves obtained at high cadence . in theory , we can measure transit times to several seconds with a moderate - sized telescope , but in practice we are limited by correlated noise in the light curves , which arises from unknown changes in either the ccd sensitivity , telescope optics or observing conditions @xcite .",
    "there may also be real brightness variations in the flux of the target or comparison stars .",
    "when these sources of correlated noise are minimised , it is possible to measure central transit times to @xmath8 seconds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples using space and ground - based photometry , respectively ) .",
    "this allows the detection of earth - mass planets in low - order mean - motion resonance , or more massive planets out of resonance ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we developed the rise ( rapid imager to search for exoplanets ) instrument to obtain high precision light curves of exoplanets for ttv measurements .",
    "rise is a fast readout camera mounted on the 2.0-m liverpool telescope ( lt ) on la palma .",
    "it was commissioned in 2008 february , and since then there have been on going observations to observe exoplanet transits and detect a ttv signal .",
    "first results from rise have been presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g08 ) for wasp-3 , and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g09 ) for tres-3 , where @xmath610 seconds timing accuracy is achieved for the best transits .",
    "hat - p-3 was discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t07 ) , and is a @xmath60.6 @xmath9 mass planet orbiting a k - type dwarf star with a period of @xmath10 days .",
    "the best light curve was taken with the 1.2 m telescope at flwo , and since then there have been no published high quality light curves of this system . here",
    ", we present a further seven rise transit light curves of hat - p-3 , and use them to improve the system parameters .",
    "additionally , we extract the ttv signal in an effort to detect a third body in the system .",
    "in section  [ sect : observations ] we describe the observations and data reduction , and in section  [ sect : modelling ] describe how the light curves are modelled and in particular how the central transit times and uncertainties are found .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sect : results ] , where we use the transit timing residuals to place upper mass limits on a perturbing planet that could be present in the hat - p-3 system without being detected from our observations . finally , in section  [ sect : summary ] we summarise and discuss our results .",
    "five full and two partial transits were observed using the lt and rise from 2009 january 24 to 2009 may 26 .",
    "the rise instrument is described in detail in @xcite and g08 .",
    "it consists of a frame transfer ccd with a relatively large field - of - view ( 9.4 @xmath11 9.4 arcmin@xmath12 ) , and a single wide band filter ( @xmath6 500700 nm ) .    for all observations ,",
    "the instrument was in @xmath13 binning mode , giving a scale of 1.1 arcsec pixel@xmath14 .",
    "for the first two transits , exposure times of 5 seconds were used with the telescope slightly defocused to reduce flat fielding errors and avoid saturating the ccd .",
    "a total of 2520 images were obtained over a 3.5 hour period , allowing @xmath63545 mins both before and after the transit . for the remaining transits ,",
    "exposure times of 4 seconds were used , and the telescope had slightly less defocusing , to allow 3150 images to be taken over a @xmath63.5 hour period for the full transits .",
    "due to observing constraints and weather , less than 3150 images were taken on most nights , and the actual number of images obtained each night is shown in table  [ tab : hatp3_lightcurves ] .",
    "the images have a typical fwhm of @xmath62 - 4 pixels ( @xmath62.2 - 4.4arcsec ) , and the nights were clear for the majority of the observations , except for the night of 2009 april 24 , where large scatter due to clouds can be seen in the light curve .",
    "images were first de - biased and flat - fielded with combined twilight flats using standard iraf routines .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed on the target and comparison stars with pyraf and the daophot package .",
    "the number of comparison stars and aperture size for each of the nights is shown in table  [ tab : hatp3_lightcurves ] .",
    "these varied as the conditions and field orientation changed for each night of observations , and were selected to minimise the out - of - transit rms .",
    "the light curves were then extracted by dividing the flux from hat - p-3 from the sum of the flux from the comparison stars ( all checked to be non - variable ) .",
    "initial estimates of the photometric errors were calculated using the aperture electron flux , sky and read noise .",
    "the light curves were then normalised by dividing through with a linear function of time fitted to the out - of - transit data , setting the unocculted flux of hat - p-3 equal to one .",
    "the normalisation parameters are allowed to vary freely when fitting the light curves , to account for any errors resulting from this procedure .",
    "the light curves , along with their best fit models and residuals ( see section  [ sect : system_parameters ] ) , are shown in figures  [ fig : hatp3_lightcurves_a ] and [ fig : hatp3_lightcurves_b ] in 1 minute bins .",
    "a phase folded light curve generated from the seven rise light curves is shown in figure  [ fig : hatp3_phased_lightcurve ] , again in 1 minute bins .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath15 re - scale factor from red noise analysis ( see section  [ sect : system_parameters ] )",
    ".          whilst not showing a significant ttv signal , upper mass limits may still be placed on the presence of a third body in the system as a function of period ratio , by fitting model timing residuals to the timing residuals measured with rise . the same procedure was used in g09 , where the equations of motion were integrated using a 4th - order runge - kutta method , with the first two bodies representing the star and planet of the hat - p-3 system , and the third body representing a hypothetical perturbing planet .",
    "the transit times were then extracted when the star and transiting planet align along the direction of observation , and the residuals of a straight line fit are the model timing residuals .    due to limitations in computation , we assume the amplitude of the timing residuals is proportional to the mass of the perturbing planet @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the timing residuals increase with increasing eccentricity of the perturbing planet . hence , to set upper mass limits we can assume the planets have initially circular orbits .",
    "this is not necessarily true near mean - motion resonance ( g09 ) , which is discussed later .",
    "the orbits of the planets are assumed to be coplanar throughout .",
    "models were created for an earth - mass perturbing planet , with a perturbing planet to transiting planet period ratio distributed from 0.2 to 5.0 .",
    "the sampling was increased around both the interior and exterior 2:1 resonance ( where we expect to probe for the smallest planets ) , and the transit times were extracted at six directions of observation starting along the y - axis , spaced evenly around the star .",
    "each model was started with the two planets aligned along the y - axis , at opposing sides of the star , and we simulated 2 years of ttvs .",
    "the upper mass limit was determined for each model by scaling the mass of the perturbing planet until the @xmath16 of the model fit increased by a value @xmath17 @xcite from that of a linear ephemeris ( i.e. a straight line ) .",
    "the @xmath16 is then minimised along the epoch , and for a constant added to the residuals , and the mass of the perturbing planet is scaled again until the maximum mass allowed is determined .",
    "this is repeated for each observation direction , and the maximum mass found is assumed as our upper mass limit for each period ratio .",
    "this process was then repeated twice , with the initial mass of the perturbing planet set to the previously determined upper mass limit .",
    "this was found to have little effect on the upper mass limits set , justifying our assumption that the timing residuals scale with the mass of the perturbing planet .",
    "figure  [ fig : upper_mass_plot ] shows a plot of the upper mass limits as a function of the period ratio .",
    "the solid black line is the upper mass limits set from the three - body simulations , and the horizontal dashed line represents an earth - mass planet .",
    "the results show that our data were sufficiently sensitive to probe for masses as small as 0.33 @xmath5 and 1.81 @xmath5 in the interior and exterior 2:1 resonance , respectively .",
    "the greater sensitivity in the interior 2:1 resonance may be explained in terms of the libration cycle of the timing residuals .",
    "the libration period of the interior resonance is @xmath665 orbits of hat - p-3b , which allows most of the libration cycle to be covered by the rise transits .",
    "however , the libration period for the exterior 2:1 resonance is longer , @xmath6200 orbits of hat - p-3b , so only a small portion of the libration cycle is covered by the rise transits . therefore , in the exterior 2:1 resonance , lower mass perturbers are not as easily constrained by the transit times .",
    "g09 found the assumption that the smallest timing residuals occur when the perturbing planet has an initially circular orbit is not valid near mean - motion resonance .",
    "this was tested in the same way by creating a series of models around the resonances with non - zero eccentricity .",
    "a set of models with eccentricities ranging from 0 to 0.23 were created around the exterior 2:1 resonance , and it was found that the amplitude of the timing residuals may drop at low eccentricities by as much as an order of magnitude before rising again at high eccentricities .",
    "this may be partly due to the planets getting perturbed by different amounts from their initial period ratios and overshooting the resonance @xcite , resulting in different period ratios when only varying the initial eccentricities .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the interior 2:1 resonance , but with the residuals only dropping by about a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "this is a similar conclusion to that in g09 , and again suggests that to set true upper mass limits around resonance , the effect of eccentricity needs to be investigated in detail .",
    "these models were then used to place upper mass limits as before , and we found that more realistic upper mass limits would be @xmath60.7 ",
    "1.0 @xmath5 and @xmath630  40 @xmath5 in the interior and exterior resonance , respectively .",
    "some similar sets of models were produced out of resonance , in which the amplitude of the ttv signal does increase with eccentricity of the perturbing planet , and thus the upper mass limits found are valid .",
    "@xcite explore the stability limits in exoplanet systems , and provide an inequality to test whether a system is hill stable ( equation 2 ) .",
    "using this inequality for the hat - p-3 system ( assuming an earth - massed perturber ) , places lower and upper limits on the period ratio of 0.74 and 1.37 , respectively .",
    "the resulting region not guaranteed to be hill stable is marked on figure  [ fig : upper_mass_plot ] by the grey shading , although stable configurations may still occur in this region .",
    "trojan companions may also exist in stable orbits near the 1:1 resonance .",
    "@xcite placed a @xmath18 upper mass limit of @xmath19 earth masses on a trojan companion to hat - p-3b by combining transit observations and radial velocity data .",
    "this paper presents the second transit timing study using the rise instrument on the lt , consisting of seven light curves of the exoplanet system hat - p-3 .",
    "an mcmc algorithm was used to determine the light curve parameters , which were found to be in agreement with the discovery paper , but with a higher precision .",
    "the central transit times and uncertainties were also determined using the mcmc algorithm , and a residual permutation algorithm was used as an independent check on the errors .",
    "uncertainties in the transit times range from @xmath20 seconds , much greater than the typical transit times obtained for tres-3 using rise ( g09 ) .",
    "this is partly due to the shallower transit of hat - p-3 , but also due to the higher levels of systematic noise in the light curves .",
    "the central transit times were found to be consistent with a linear ephemeris , with @xmath21 after removing those light curves with less than 20 minutes of data either before ingress or after egress .",
    "these transit times were then used to place upper mass limits of an additional planet in the system that could perturb the orbit of hat - p-3b yet not be detected by our measurements .",
    "this showed that we probed for masses as low as 0.33 @xmath5 and 1.81 @xmath5 in the interior and exterior 2:1 resonance , respectively .",
    "however , larger planets may exist in low eccentricity orbits in the 2:1 resonances , and further investigation is required to explore true upper mass limits in a higher dimensional parameter space . these are comparable with the mass limits set using the same techniques for tres-3 in g09 , which had many more light curves available , plus transit times with smaller uncertainties .",
    "this is because the period of hat - p-3 is larger than that of tres-3 , and reflects that the sensitivity of the transit timing method increases with the period of the transiting planet .",
    "rise was designed and built with resources made available from queen s university belfast , liverpool john moores university and the university of manchester .",
