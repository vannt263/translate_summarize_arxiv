    "the layered nickelate family la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 has been the focus of many recent investigations on account of its stripe - ordered phase .",
    "this phase is characterized by the segregation of charge carriers into an ordered array of parallel lines separating antiferromagnetic domains of ni@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) spins @xcite .",
    "stripes represent a novel type of complex order , and their properties have been energetically researched since the discovery of stripe order in members of the copper - oxide high-@xmath5 superconductors @xcite .",
    "experiments to establish the basic physics of the stripe phase in model non - superconducting systems can help determine whether or not stripes play an important role in the mechanism of superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "the nature of the spin and charge order in the stripe phase in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 has been characterized in detail over the doping range @xmath6 by electron , x - ray and neutron diffraction @xcite , and it is now of interest to explore the collective spin and charge dynamics over the same range of composition . from such studies",
    "one can learn about the nature of the excited states , and hence gain insight into the microscopic interactions that stabilize stripe order .",
    "in this paper we describe neutron scattering studies of the magnetic order and dynamics in a number of la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 compounds . some of the data for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems have been reported previously @xcite . here",
    "we focus on results obtained with polarized neutrons , and emphasize how certain characteristic features of the data vary with composition .",
    "all the data presented here were collected on the in20 triple - axis spectrometer at the institut laue - langevin . since its upgrade in 2001",
    ", the flux of polarized neutrons on in20 has increased by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this gain has allowed experimentalists to be more ambitious , especially with regard to inelastic scattering measurements .",
    "in20 is equipped with focussing arrays of heusler crystals for both monochromator and analyser .",
    "typical experiments require measurement of the spin - flip ( sf ) and non - spin - flip ( nsf ) scattering , with the neutron polarization @xmath9 in the horizontal scattering plane either parallel or perpendicular to the scattering vector @xmath10 , or with @xmath9 vertical .",
    "for the present measurements the analyser was set to reflect neutrons of fixed final energy 14.7mev .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 were prepared in oxford by the floating - zone method @xcite .",

    "next we discuss two characteristic features observed in the stripe - phase spin dynamics of la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 .",
    "we refer to the energy scans shown in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2 ] .",

    "the spin - flip ( sf ) scattering was measured with @xmath38 , and the sf background was estimated from scans centred away from the magnetic excitation peak .",
    "the measurements were made at temperatures of 2k ( @xmath39 ) , 10k(@xmath8 ) and 13.5k(@xmath7 ) . ]    one feature common to all the scans shown in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2 ] is a reduction in intensity below an energy of @xmath40mev for @xmath41 , or @xmath42mev for @xmath8 .",
    "this reduction is not present in energy scans made at equivalent @xmath35 wavevectors with a large component along the @xmath43 axis ( not shown ) . given that neutrons scatter from spin fluctuations perpendicular to @xmath44 , these observations indicate that the intensity reduction below 47mev is due to the freezing out of the c - axis component of the spin fluctuations .",
    "this points to the existence of a 47mev energy gap due to single - ion out - of - plane anisotropy .",
    "polarized neutrons provide a direct method to check for anisotropy gaps . below an anisotropy gap",
    "one component of the spin fluctuations is frozen out , and the component involved can be identified by polarization analysis .",
    "we measured the sf scattering from the @xmath7 crystal at energies of 3 , 10 , 15 and 26mev , with the three - dimensional wavevector fixed at @xmath45 , @xmath46 = 0 or 1 .",
    "for these measurements the crystal was mounted with the @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] directions in the horizontal scattering plane , and we switched the neutron polarization between three orthogonal directions : ( i ) @xmath49 , ( ii ) @xmath50 in the scattering plane , and ( iii ) @xmath51 vertical ( i.e.parallel to the stripe direction @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "we label the corresponding sf intensities @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively",
    ". for the case @xmath56 , which was used with energies of 10 , 15 and 26mev , it can be shown that @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the components of the dynamic magnetic response function describing spin correlations along the crystal @xmath43 axis ( @xmath58 ) , and parallel to the stripe direction ( @xmath59 ) . at 3mev",
    "the intensity at @xmath60 shows a slight modulation with @xmath46 due to weak inter - layer correlations .",
    "this modulation peaks at odd @xmath46 integers , and we made the 3mev measurement at the @xmath61 intensity maximum .",
    "as far as the crystal orientation is concerned the difference in angle between @xmath62 and @xmath63 is only @xmath64 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is still a very good approximation .",
    "the results of these measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig3 ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath65 is seen to be constant within experimental error for energies from 10mev to 26mev .",
    "the average value of @xmath65 in this energy range is close to that calculated on the assumption of isotropic spin fluctuations about the ordered moment direction @xmath25 away from the stripe direction @xcite .",
    "the point at 3mev , however , is much lower than the others , indicating a strong reduction in out - of - plane spin fluctuations at this energy .",
    "axis ( @xmath58 ) to that parallel to the stripe direction ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the measurements were made by neutron polarization analysis at the two - dimensional magnetic zone centre @xmath66 .",
    "the broken line is the calculated ratio for isotropic spin wave oscillations about an ordered moment direction @xmath25 away from the stripe direction .",
    "the reduction in @xmath65 at low energies is due to the suppression of out - of - plane spin fluctuations below the 7mev gap visible in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2](b ) .",
    "the solid line is a guide to the eye . ]",
    "these results show that the spin fluctuations are predominantly in - plane at energies of 3mev , and isotropic about the direction of the ordered moment at 10mev and above .",
    "this confirms that the 7mev feature in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2](b ) for the @xmath7 crystal is the out - of - plane anisotropy gap .",
    "similar measurements on the @xmath8 crystal showed likewise for the 4mev gap in fig.[pnsxm_fig2](d ) .",
    "we searched for the in - plane anisotropy gap in energy scans at wavevectors nearly perpendicular to the nio layers , but could only put an upper limit on the gap energy of 1mev .",
    "interestingly , the out - of - plane energy gap in undoped la@xmath67nio@xmath2 is 16mev @xcite .",
    "together with the data reported here this indicates that the out - of - plane anisotropy decreases with doping . in a spin - wave model ,",
    "the gap energy varies as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the anisotropy energy and @xmath70 is the total exchange energy per spin . measurements of the overall spin - wave dispersion have established that the intra and inter - stripe ni ",
    "ni exchange interactions differ by only a factor 2 @xcite , so that @xmath70 decreases relatively slowly with doping .",
    "this implies a very considerable decrease in @xmath69 with doping , which has been confirmed by spin - wave analyses for @xmath71 and 0.33 , for which @xmath72mev and @xmath73mev respectively @xcite .",
    "the other notable feature is the dip centred on @xmath74mev and subsequent peak near @xmath75mev in figs .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2](a)(c ) .",
    "this dip  peak structure occurs in an energy range where there is strong scattering from phonons , as evident in the nsf channel shown in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2](b ) , and so neutron polarization analysis is an important tool to isolate the magnetic scattering .",
    "constant - energy scans performed at energies close to 26mev showed that the magnetic response is significantly broader in @xmath76 for @xmath24 than for @xmath7 . since the scans shown in fig .  [ pnsxm_fig2 ] measure the amplitude of the magnetic response it is possible that this broadening has washed - out the @xmath77mev peak for @xmath24 .",
    "there is no sign of the dip  peak structure in the data for @xmath8 , and although the equivalent energy scans for @xmath71 do present a superficial resemblance to those in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2 ] the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that for the case of @xmath71 the signal in this energy range is fully accounted for by a spin wave model with two anisotropy gaps .",
    "the anomalous dip  peak structure in figs .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig2](a)(c ) can not be explained by two anisotropy gaps because , as shown above , the anisotropy gaps for @xmath240.37 are below 10mev .",
    "it is not clear at present what mechanism drives the spin reorientation in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 , but our results show , ( i ) that the reorientation occurs for several doping levels , including compositions in which the stripes are commensurate ( @xmath7 ) and incommensurate ( @xmath28 and 0.5 ) with the host lattice , and ( ii ) that the angle of the ordered moment relative to the stripe direction tends to increase with doping .",
    "the reorientation transition is most prominent for @xmath8 , which has the highest charge ordering temperature ( @xmath78k ) and a slightly - incommensurate checkerboard charge ordering pattern below @xmath79k @xcite .",
    "we also can not offer an explanation for the pronounced decrease in single - ion anisotropy with doping .",
    "we can , however , comment on a possible origin of the dip  peak feature in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "an explanation involving purely magnetic interactions seems unlikely since the feature is most prominent for @xmath7 , whose spins order into a two - sublattice antiferromagnetic structure @xcite .",
    "the zero - field spin wave spectrum of such an ordering contains no gaps other than those due to anisotropy , and we have shown above that for @xmath7 the anisotropy gaps are 7mev and @xmath80mev .",
    "moreover , the polarization of the spin fluctuations is constant over the dip  peak region , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pnsxm_fig3 ] .",
    "hybridization with phonon excitations of the host lattice is a possibility , but seems unlikely given that the anomalous dip is absent for @xmath71 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the evidence so far points to a hybridization with an excitation associated with the stripes , possibly a cooperative motion of the charge domain walls .",
    "finally , we mention that the experiments reported here illustrate well the power of neutron polarization analysis to determine static and fluctuating spin components , and to separate magnetic and non - magnetic scattering unambiguously ."
