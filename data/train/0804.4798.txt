    "as the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe , the rate of emergence of galaxy clusters since the big bang might be expected to be among the most straightforward predictions of cosmological models . yet despite the advent of the era of precision cosmology ushered in by observations of sne and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , significant uncertainty remains in the expected numbers of galaxy clusters at @xmath0 .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies on scales corresponding to clusters are not accurately known , leading to a range of values for @xmath11 , the rms matter fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath12 mpc at @xmath13 .",

    "galaxy clusters contain an unusually high density of galaxies , they provide an efficient means of observing substantial numbers of galaxies at a common distance , offering the hope of constructing the analog of the hertzsprung - russell ( i.e. color - magnitude ) diagram for galaxy evolution .",
    "indeed , studies of the relationship between color and magnitude indicate that clusters are the habitat of galaxies with the oldest and most massive stellar populations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , objects reasonably free of the complications associated with starbursts and dust .",
    "these studies are consistent with an extremely simple formation history for cluster galaxies , in which their stars are formed in a short burst at high redshift , and they evolve quiescently thereafter ( we use the term `` red spike model '' in referring to this scenario - see figure [ m_vs_z ] ) .",
    "studies of the near - ir luminosity functions of cluster galaxies reinforce this picture ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , high redshift galaxy clusters also provide an observational pillar for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .    obtaining substantial samples of galaxy clusters at @xmath0",
    "has proved challenging , largely because such objects are difficult to detect using only optical data .",
    "due to their greatly enhanced rate of star formation by @xmath8 , the uv emission from modest sized field galaxies overwhelms that from the intrinsically red spectra of quiesecent , early type galaxies preferentially found in clusters .",
    "the red sequence cluster survey @xcite uses the observed color - magnitude relationship in cluster galaxies to improve the contrast and has proven highly efficient to @xmath8 , but the optical colors of the red sequence become increasingly degenerate at higher redshifts , as they no longer span the rest 4000  break .",

    "deep near infrared imaging from the flamingos extragalactic survey ( flamex ) is available for half the botes region @xcite , and was used for deriving a prior on the redshift likelihood functions ( see  [ sec : photz ] ) .",

    "object selection for the cluster search was carried out in the @xmath1 m band , because the negative k - correction as the rest  frame @xmath68 m peak shifts into this band leads to a flux which is nearly independent of redshift for @xmath69 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "object detection and photometry was carried out using sextractor @xcite in double  image mode , allowing matched aperture photometry in the other irac bands .",
    "while smaller apertures maximize the depth of the survey , monte carlo simulations showed that 5  diameter aperture magnitudes are necessary to provide sufficiently reliable color measurements and photometric redshifts @xcite . this flux limit ( 5@xmath26 at @xmath53 m in 5 )",

    "the ndwfs catalogs were also generated using sextractor , but run in single - image mode in each band .",
    "detections in the different optical bands and between the optical and irac catalogs were matched if the centroids were within @xmath73 of each other , using the closest optical source if more than one satisfied this criterion .",
    "for very extended objects ( generally at @xmath74 ) , detections in the different bands were matched if the centroids were within an ellipse defined using the second order moments of the light distribution of the object @xcite .",
    "the ndwfs data were taken over several years in variable conditions , and therefore the photometric depths vary somewhat from pointing to pointing .",

    "average 5@xmath26 flux ( magnitude ) limits in a 5aperture ( which is significantly larger than the optimum detection aperture for these data ) were measured via monte carlo simulations to be @xmath76 @xmath71jy  ( @xmath77 mag ) in @xmath58 , @xmath78 @xmath71jy  ( @xmath79 mag ) in @xmath59 , and @xmath80 @xmath71jy  ( @xmath81 mag ) in the @xmath57band @xcite . in the space  based irac shallow survey the depth is more uniform , and in the @xmath82 m band it is @xmath83 @xmath71jy  ( @xmath84 mag ) , also derived from a monte carlo simulation .",
    "although the majority of objects in the @xmath1m - selected catalog are well detected at shorter wavelengths , this is not generally the case for @xmath85 red ellipticals .",
    "objects at these redshifts are often quite faint in the optical as the 4000  break is longward of the @xmath57band ( see figure 1 ) . where sources were observed but not detected , the flux was taken to be zero and a monte carlo 1@xmath26 error was adopted .",
    "this approach is optimal for photometric redshift fitting , where the non - detection provides important contraints on the galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the photometry used for photometric redshift estimation (  [ sec : photz ] ) consists of @xmath86[4.5]$ ] data with the monte carlo photometric errors and limits noted above .",
    "the @xmath87 m and @xmath88 m bands were not used because they do not have the sensitivity to detect @xmath85 cluster @xmath54 galaxies in the irac shallow survey .",

    "all of this falls within the optical ndwfs botes  region .",
    "however , due to haloes around bright objects , shorter observation times for regions at the edges of individual mosaic camera pointings , and residual ccd defects , 0.75 @xmath89 may have lower quality optical photometry and hence photometric redshifts . hence these regions are also excluded from the sample .",
    "finally , 14,044 stars were removed from the catalog using the sextractor stellarity index in the best seeing optical data for each location .",
    "comparison to the star count model of @xcite , as tabulated in @xcite , suggests that @xmath90 of stars were identified via this approach , leaving @xmath91 of the @xmath1 m sample as unrecognized stars .    in summary ,",
    "photometric redshifts were estimated for a total of 175,431 objects brighter than @xmath70 @xmath71jy  ( @xmath92 ) at @xmath53 m in 5   in a 7.25 @xmath89 region .",
    "a full description of the photometric redshift methodology is given in @xcite .",
    "a summary of those aspects most relevant to cluster detection is provided here .",
    "photometric redshifts were computed using an empirical template ",
    "fitting algorithm which linearly interpolates between the four coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) seds ( e , sbc , scd , and i m ) , augmented by the @xcite sb3 and sb2 starburst templates .",
    "these seds were extended to the far  uv and near  ir using @xcite models .",
    "these stellar photospheric models do not include emission from dust , in particular the pah features which dominate the @xmath93 m portion of the spectrum in starforming galaxies , but at @xmath0 the photometry used does not sample these rest wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the large ages ( c. kochanek et al . in preparation ) survey , there are @xmath94 spectroscopic redshifts extending to @xmath95 gleaned from several ongoing surveys in the botes field .",
    "these were used as training sets to adjust the templates and photometric zero points to improve overall redshift accuracy and reliability ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "comparison with these spectroscopic samples shows that an rms dispersion of @xmath96 is achieved for 95% of galaxies to at least @xmath97 .",
    "subsequent follow  up spectroscopy of high redshift candidate clusters (  [ sec : keck ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) verify this accuracy .",
    "a key output of the @xcite technique is the redshift probability function for each object , @xmath98 , derived directly from the redshift - axis projection of the full redshift  sed likelihood surface . to transform these simple redshift likelihood functions into true probability distribution functions ,",
    "a prior consisting of the observed redshift distribution was applied .",
    "this was measured in the flamex region using high ",
    "quality @xmath99[4.5]$ ] photometric redshifts .",
    "comparison to the spectroscopic sample illustrates that the resulting distribution functions are statistically valid in the sense that integrated areas accurately represent redshift probabilities at the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath26 levels .",
    "these @xmath98 functions are the input to the wavelet detection algorithm discussed in ",
    "[ sec : detn ] and are also used in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "note that the @xmath98 distributions shows relatively little dependence on galaxy type @xcite .",
    "the reason is that while all galaxies are selected to have at least 5 sigma detections in [ 4.5 ] , red galaxies are often only marginally detected or even undetected in our optical images , since they have very little blue light .",
    "this is particularly true at @xmath85 where the @xmath100-correction for early types is large in the optical .",
    "blue galaxies have good @xmath101[3.6][4.5 ] photometry , because they have more blue light .",
    "thus even though blue , late - type galaxy sed s have smaller breaks , they have more extensive ( useful ) photometry . these compensating effects lead to effectively type - independent photometric redshifts for @xmath85 galaxies .",
    "we employed a wavelet analysis to identify galaxy clusters within the botes  region .",
    "wavelet decomposition is a commonly used technique for cluster identification in x - ray images ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it provides an effective means of identifying extended sources in the presence of contaminating point sources . in principle",
    ", a similar analysis can be used with optical and infrared data sets , using galaxies rather than x - ray photons to identify extended sources . as is well known ,",
    "galaxy number counts are more susceptible to projection effects than is bremsstrahlung emission from the icm .",
    "this issue is one that must be dealt with for all optical and infrared cluster searches , and consequently most such searches for distant clusters make explicit assumptions about the properties of the distant cluster population , such as an assumed density profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the presence of a red sequence @xcite .",
    "the sdss c4 technique @xcite does not require a _ red _ sequence , but it does demand that the colors of cluster galaxies are similar to one another .",
    "a significant advantage of the botes  data set is that the photometric redshifts permit such assumptions to be minimized .",
    "the full photometric redshift probability distributions @xmath98 were used to construct weighted galaxy density maps within overlapping redshift slices of width @xmath102 , stepping through redshift space in increments of @xmath103 . for each galaxy",
    "the weight in the map corresponds to the probability that the galaxy lies within the given redshift slice .",
    "weighting in this fashion de - emphasizes sources for which the redshift is poorly constrained .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that _ all _ galaxies were included in construction of the density map , and consequently cluster detection should be relatively independent of sed type and hence independent of morphology .",
    "finally , cluster detection will be insensitive to the resolution of the density maps provided that the pixel size is small compared to the angular extent of cluster cores at all redshifts .",
    "a resolution of 12@xmath104 kpc ) per pixel was used , which satisfies this criterion while being sufficiently large to keep computational overhead manageable .",
    "galaxy cluster candidates were detected within each redshift slice by convolving the density map with the wavelet kernel .",
    "we use a gaussian difference kernel of the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 kpc and @xmath107 kpc , and which crosses zero near @xmath108 mpc .",
    "the scale of the kernel is fixed in physical rather than angular units , preserving our ability to uniformly identify comparable systems at different redshifts .",
    "the precise physical values of @xmath26 are subject to refinement , but the selected values effectively isolate overdensities on the scale of clusters or groups .    galaxy cluster candidates were detected in each redshift slice of these wavelet smoothed galaxy density maps using a simple peak - finding algorithm . to establish a consistent significance level for the candidates , 1000 bootstrap simulations were carried out within each redshift slice .",
    "the existing p(z ) distributions , right ascensions , and declinations were repeatedly shuffled , convolved with the wavelet kernel , and candidates detected to find the threshold corresponding to one false positive per redshift slice within the botes  field .",
    "a list of detections above this significance threshold was generated for each redshift slice . because the right ascensions and declinations were shuffled independently , the true correlated background was not preserved .",
    "consequently , the contamination rate may be somewhat higher than the one false positive per redshift slice expected if we had preserved the correlated background .",
    "for the current analysis we accept the somewhat higher contamination rate in exchange for improved completeness , particularly for the highest redshift clusters .",
    "the majority of clusters are detected in multiple redshift slices ( a natural consequence of sampling in slices separated by step sizes finer than the galaxy redshift uncertainties ) .",
    "multiple detections with small separations in positions and redshift slices were considered to be a single cluster , which was assigned an estimated redshift and position corresponding to the slice with the highest statistical significance .",
    "a total of 335 candidates were found in redshift slices with centers from 0.1 to 1.9 , including 98 in slices with @xmath85 .    while the detection technique is on three dimensional overdensities , it is not immune to projection effects .",
    "the expected number of clusters in each cylindrical bin of length @xmath102 and radius 1 mpc ( the radius of the wavelet detection kernel ) was computed to quantify the extent of projection .",
    "this calculation included both the random expectation due to the observed number density and the excess clusters expected due to the observed clustering of this sample @xcite .",
    "the projection rate is most significant for lower redshifts because of the large angular size corresponding to 1 mpc , affecting @xmath109 of systems at @xmath110 to @xmath111 at @xmath112 .",
    "the projection rate decreases to below @xmath113% at @xmath114 and is negligible at @xmath115 .",
    "overall we estimate that @xmath3 of the candidates may be spurious , including the contamination noted in the previous paragraph .",
    "the peak of the summed @xmath98 distribution at the cluster detection location was taken as the initial estimate of each cluster s redshift . to improve this estimate , individual objects within a 1 mpc radius of the cluster which included the cluster redshift within the @xmath116 range of their @xmath98 functions",
    "were considered candidate cluster members . a refined estimate ( @xmath117 ) of the mean cluster redshift",
    "was obtained from the peak of the summed @xmath98 distribution for these members . from this analysis ,",
    "104 candidates have @xmath118 .    in table [ z1table ] and figures 2 - 13 we present 12 of the cluster candidates that were detected via the above criteria , and subsequently spectroscopically confirmed at the keck observatory to lie at @xmath85 ( see  [ sec : keck ] ) .",
    "two of these , iscs  j1434.1 + 3328 and iscs  j1429.2 + 3357 , have @xmath119 but the spectroscopic mean redshifts are @xmath44 and @xmath120 respectively .",

    "it is possible to estimate cluster masses via scaling relations using the velocity dispersion . the line of sight velocity dispersion for the 20 spectroscopic member galaxies in cluster 19 ( iscs  j1433.1 + 3334 ) at @xmath156 is 760 km s@xmath5 in the rest frame , and for the 23 spectroscopic member galaxies in cluster 17 ( iscs  j1432.4 + 3332 ) at @xmath157 it is 734 km s@xmath5 .",

    "clusters 17 and 19 are at the top of this range , again providing mass estimates consistent with those found using the velocity dispersion .",
    "more detailed exploration of this approach will require photometry which takes account of the extent to which a 5  diameter aperture fails to include all of the light from such galaxies , or includes light from multiple galaxies ( as determined from higher spatial resolution imaging ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , out to @xmath8 substantial evidence exists which is consistent with an extremely simple formation history for cluster galaxies , in which their stars are formed in a short burst at high redshift , and they evolve quiescently thereafter ( ie a `` red spike '' model ) .",
    "the colors of luminous cluster galaxies out to @xmath8 typically fall on a tight sequence which is red relative to field galaxies at similar redshift ( the `` red sequence '' ) , with a mean color which evolves as the red spike model predicts .",
    "the most luminous red sequence galaxies are the reddest , a correlation which is attributed to higher metallicity in higher mass galaxies ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation ( i.e the color - magnitude or mass - metallicity relation ) is explained by additional cycles of star formation and enrichment in more massive galaxies , as they are able to retain their gas more effectively against supernovae - driven winds @xcite . in the red spike formation paradigm , this is a natural consequence . in the context of the hierarchical merging galaxy formation models ,",
    "a unique correlation between stellar mass and metallicity is a greater challenge . while the inclusion of feedback ( whether by supernovae or by agn ) in hierarchical models stops the buildup of galaxy mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such models have difficulty reproducing the exact color and slope of the color - magnitude relation in clusters over the full redshift range for which it has been measured .",
    "recent work shows promise , however , as feedback behavior and other `` gastrophysical '' effects are taken more into account ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the onset of the star formation  spike \" is simultaneous for all cluster galaxies , and if the color - magnitude relation is caused by more protracted spikes in more massive galaxies , then as one approaches the star - forming epoch , massive galaxies might be expected to eventually become bluer , reversing the slope of the color - magnitude relation . in fact no measurable change is seen in color - magnitude slope out to @xmath8 ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests either formation redshifts well before @xmath174 , or that the spikes begin earlier in more massive galaxies , perhaps ending rather than beginning simultaneously . the small and unchanging scatter of the red sequence in clusters out to @xmath175 ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also argues for synchronized or very early spikes and against a primarily age - based origin of the color - magnitude relation , since the scatter would increase by a much larger amount , and faster , than has been observed .",
    "testing to what extent red spike models remain consistent with cluster galaxy data at @xmath0 is one of the primary motivations for the present study .",
    "we begin by constructing the color - magnitude relations for the 12 spectroscopically confirmed clusters in table [ z1table ] .",
    "figures [ cmds1 ] and [ cmds2 ] present color magnitude diagrams for the clusters listed in table [ z1table ] . the @xmath7 $ ] color was selected because these filters bracket the 4000  break most tightly at @xmath0 .",

    "evidently the red sequence persists in dense environments to @xmath182 , even when not used as a selection criterion .",
    "in addition there is no indication that the slope of the color - magnitude relation has changed sign , and in fact a non - evolving coma cluster slope appears consistent with the data .",
    "comparing the data for e.g.  cluster 14 ( iscs  j1426.5 + 3339 at @xmath183 ) vs.  29 ( iscs j1432.6 + 3436 at @xmath184 ) suggests real differences in the scatter of the color - magnitude relation do exist .",
    "the presence of luminous galaxies substantially bluer than the red sequence in several clusters , a number of them spectroscopically confirmed , is also noteworthy .",
    "these may represent a population of massive star - forming galaxies which fade onto the red sequence in rich clusters , but is not found in field surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that the very low scatters reported for @xmath185 clusters in e.g. @xcite and @xcite are calculated for galaxies known to have early - type morphologies , using much deeper photometry than the survey / discovery data used here .",
    "further investigation of the color - magnitude relations is deferred to a future paper which will use deeper _ spitzer _ and _ hst _ imaging presently being obtained .",
    "although the survey data used to identify the clusters does not enable accurate photometry of individual galaxies in clusters , we can calculate mean properties for galaxies in each cluster with some confidence . in the next section",
    "we briefly explore the color evolution and color - magnitude relation of the entire cluster sample .",
    "figure [ im3p6vsz ] plots the average @xmath7 $ ] color for galaxies within 1 mpc of the cluster centers , and whose integrated redshift probability distribution in the range @xmath176 exceeds 0.3 . the mean",
    "values are calculated after iteratively clipping @xmath186 outliers . as implied by the color - magnitude diagrams for the spectroscopically confirmed clusters (  [ sec : cmds ] ) ,",
    "the red spike model ( 0.1 gyr burst at @xmath9 ) provides a remarkably good fit to the empirical data , validating the survey design assumptions illustrated in figure [ m_vs_z ] .",
    "much of the increase in @xmath7 $ ] with redshift is due to the change in the rest frame wavelengths observed , and in figure [ im3p6relnevsz ] we plot the average color relative to a no - evolution model ( i.e. the k - corrected color ) .",
    "the no - evolution model is simply the red spike model at z=0 , i.e. at an age of 11.3 gyr for the stellar population .",
    "clearly the evolving red spike model is a better fit to the data than is the k - correction alone .",
    "note that the photometric redshifts (  [ sec : photz ] ) are calculated using _",
    "non_-evolving templates , so this result is not a foregone conclusion , particularly at @xmath0 .",
    "the mean @xmath7 $ ] colors in figure [ im3p6vsz ] include galaxies down to the @xmath187jy survey limit at @xmath1 m , and therefore less luminous galaxies contribute to the mean at lower redshifts .",
    "the color - magnitude relation shows that less luminous galaxies are bluer , and massive galaxies are quite quiescent today , so a constant flux limit will lead to a systematic bias towards more luminous , massive galaxies and redder mean color with increasing redshift . on the other hand",
    "the excellent fit of the red spike model implies that a constant _ luminosity _",
    "limit for the sample would select galaxies with smaller stellar masses at high redshift , since a constant stellar mass , passively evolving , will be more luminous as one approaches the formation redshift . to avoid this bias , in figure [ im3p6relnevsz ]",
    "we also show ( with red squares ) the mean colors for galaxies brighter than the red spike passively - evolving l * in [ 3.6 ] .",
    "it is evident that the mean color of the more luminous galaxies is systematically redder , and hence that the color - magnitude relation continues to hold out to @xmath181 .",
    "the color offset is 0.1 magnitudes , independent of redshift .",
    "the persistence of the essentially unchanged color - magnitude relation slope , with a passively evolving intercept , out to lookback times within 4 gyr of the big bang is a phenomenon that models of cluster galaxy formation must account for .",
    "the implication is that the correlation between high stellar population metallicity and stellar mass is already in place at @xmath181 , and that the star formation era remains well in the past for these galaxies .    in figure [ im3p6relpevsz ]",
    "the mean @xmath7 $ ] colors are plotted with the predicted @xmath7 $ ] color for the red spike model subtracted .",
    "the mean colors are for galaxies more luminous in [ 3.6 ] than the red spike l*. note the red spike model is a good match to @xmath54 galaxy colors in figures [ im3p6vsz ] and [ im3p6relnevsz ] , so the offset in color out to @xmath8 is attributable to the color - magnitude relation .",
    "other effects may be in play . in table 1",
    "the @xmath117 values tend to be lower than the @xmath188 values , which may lead to colors appearing @xmath189 mag redder relative to the red spike model than if @xmath188 were available for all @xmath0 clusters .",
    "the average colors of cluster members may still be redder than shown , however , as no attempt has been made to correct the average cluster colors for field contamination , and field galaxies tend to be bluer than cluster galaxies .",
    "blending issues could lead to colors which are systematically biased .",
    "given these uncertainties , the excellent agreement with the red spike model is the more remarkable .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath0 the trend is towards colors which are increasingly redder than the red spike model , for both the full sample and the spectroscopically confirmed subset , though there is clearly a range .",
    "hence even higher formation redshifts ( as high as @xmath190 ) are favored for most @xmath0 clusters , within the context of red spike models .",
    "figure [ im3p6vsz ] shows that that there are relatively few cluster candidates in the irac sample with @xmath192 .",
    "why is this ?",
    "the red spike model fits , circumstantial evidence from bcg luminosity , and the persistence of the color - magnitude relation suggest that the stellar populations were formed  and assembled ",
    "well before @xmath181 . from figure [ m_vs_z ] , such clusters should be detectable by the irac shallow survey .",
    "a potential selection effect against @xmath115 galaxies is that photometric redshifts in this range have increasingly broad redshift probability distributions , due in part to insufficient depth in photometry at shorter wavelengths .",
    "simulations indicate a factor of two reduction in irac photometric error can help compensate , leading to a similar reduction in photometric redshift error in this redshift range . with the _ spitzer _ deep wide - field survey legacy program now underway ( pi d.  stern ) , such data will be available in the near future .",
    "the tighter redshift probability distributions would improve the contrast of high redshift clusters over the field , allowing them to meet our detection threshold .",
    "but the lack of massive @xmath115 cluster detections may simply reflect a real decline in the space density of such objects .",
    "models for the hierarchical growth of structure predict only about 1 cluster with @xmath193 above @xmath194 for every 5 clusters with @xmath0 .",
    "full exploration of this possibility will require more careful simulation and assessment of our observational selection effects .",
    "we have identified 335 galaxy cluster and group candidates from a @xmath53 m selected sample of galaxies in the irac shallow survey .",
    "candidates were identified by searching for overdensities in photometric redshift slices , and 106 clusters are at @xmath0 .",
    "roughly 10% of these candidates may be expected to arise by chance or from projection effects . to date , 12 clusters have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath0 , as have 61 of the 73 clusters observed with ages at @xmath125 .",
    "for the two @xmath0 clusters with 20 or more spectroscopic members , total cluster masses of several @xmath195 are indicated , and the total mass estimated from the stellar luminosity yields comparable values .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams in @xmath7 $ ] vs. [ 3.6 ] for the @xmath0 spectroscopically confirmed clusters reveal that a red sequence is generally present , even though clusters were not selected for this .",
    "the brightest probable member galaxy ( at the spatial resolution of irac ) in the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath185 clusters remains 1  2 mag brighter than the passively - evolving @xmath54 luminosity .",
    "for the full cluster sample , the mean color of brighter galaxies within each cluster is systematically redder than the mean color of all probable cluster member galaxies , implying that the mass - metallicity relation is already in place at @xmath181 .",
    "the mean @xmath7 $ ] color of probable cluster members is well fit by a simple model in which stars form in a 0.1 gyr burst beginning at @xmath9 . at @xmath0",
    "there is a tendency for mean cluster colors to favor formation redshifts @xmath10 , although a few are consistent with @xmath196 .",
    "this adds to the large body of evidence that galaxies in clusters were established at extremely early times .",
