    "the conformation of individual polymer chains depends on the properties of their environment , _",
    "i.e. _ the solvent  @xcite . in the presence of",
    "a _ poor _ solvent , isolated polymer chains tend to collapse toward compact states , in which polymer - solvent contacts are minimized . for flexible polymers ,",
    "the kinetics of this coil - globule transition have been the subject of much research over the past few decades  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic pathway for flexible polymer collapse has only recently been experimentally confirmed to involve the formation of a pearl necklace and the gradual diffusion of large pearls from the chain ends  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the flexible case , many polymers exhibit substantial bending stiffness , thus adding the ( opposing ) tendency to form extended structures . this makes a compact globule energetically unfavorable for _ semiflexible _ polymers because compact globules involve large amounts of bending .",
    "such chains are described by the persistent or worm - like chain ( wlc ) model  @xcite , examples of which include predominantly biopolymers ( _ e.g. _ f - actin and dna ) but also some synthetic polymers ( _ e.g. _ kevlar ) .",
    "the balance between the tendencies to straighten the filament ( due to a bending energy ) and to condense it ( due to an effective short - range attraction or poor solvent ) is at the heart of the condensation of semiflexible polymers .",
    "the apparent equilibrium collapsed state for semiflexible polymers is well - known : chains with significant bending stiffness can form rings or toroids to avoid incurring the large bending penalty of a spherical shell or a globule .",
    "this condensed state has been suggested and studied theoretically  @xcite , demonstrated in a variety of experimental systems  @xcite , and confirmed by computer simulation  @xcite .",
    "theoretical work has predominantly addressed structural features such as the detailed packing of filaments  @xcite , while dynamical simulations and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) among others have increasingly focused on kinetic aspects and condensation intermediates  @xcite .",
    "a particular set of recent dynamical simulations of isolated chains  @xcite has strongly suggested a possible ( and in fact generic ) pathway for the collapse of semiflexible polymers .",
    "these simulations showed not only the eventual formation of tori from extended chains quenched in poor solvent but demonstrated a series of long - lived , partially collapsed intermediate states .",
    "very similar chain morphologies ( our racquet states ) also appear in other simulation work  @xcite and afm studies of dna condensation  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results , we develop and analyze a hierarchical family of metastable racquet states . in particular , we demonstrate that their relative conformational energies are consistent with the role they play in the simulations : they form an energetically driven cascade of increasingly compact conformations with sharp transitions between them .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : review ] with a brief summary of the dynamical simulation results  @xcite which motivated this analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : intermediates ] addresses the morphology and evolution of the shapes to be analyzed in the remainder of the paper .",
    "our approach to calculating the surface contributions to the conformational energies is developed in section  [ sec : tools ] , followed by the two main sections containing a detailed analysis of torus and racquet states ( sections  [ sec : torus_states ] and  [ sec : racquet_states ] respectively ) .",
    "section  [ sec : racqvstori ] finally compares their relative stability and discusses the qualitative agreement with the dynamical simulation results we set out to understand .",
    "the work described in ref .",
    "@xcite applied a standard brownian dynamics ( bd ) algorithm  @xcite to a bead - and - spring model of a single polymer chain in the plane to capture the most general features of a rather complex and biologically important process , the condensation of dna .",
    "the technical details of that study are discussed elsewhere  @xcite . here",
    ", we merely sketch the gross features and the generic results that motivated our work in this paper .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a simulated chain followed a langevin equation of the form @xmath0 for each bead @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the coefficient of viscous drag ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 the random noise .",
    "each bead is displaced by @xmath5 during a time step @xmath6 .",
    "the potential @xmath7 contains all interactions internal to the chain , including the bending energy , a short - range attractive interaction between beads ( mimicking poor solvent conditions ) and a very stiff longitudinal compliance .",
    "after thermalization of each chain , the solvent quality was quenched at @xmath8 .",
    "previous work  @xcite showed the typical dynamical evolution of a relatively short chain ( a few persistence lengths ) as a progression through well - defined stages identified by three types of conformations : extended chain with thermal undulations , various racquet states ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : annealed ] and  [ fig : schematic ] ) , and the torus or ring .",
    "we also pointed out that the end - to - end distance of the filament as a function of time changes sharply with the conformational transitions between states .",
    "it is important to note that the described conformations persist in time , as seen by quasi - plateaus in the end - to - end distance evolution , each lasting for the considerable time of about @xmath9  bd steps , about one tenth of the entire condensation event .",
    "we can roughly estimate the correspondence between simulation steps and physical time for a particular system . to do this , we express the link length as a fraction of the persistence length and substitute for the local drag coefficient , assuming the viscosity of water . for f - actin",
    ", such an estimate suggests that an entire simulation of @xmath10  bd steps models a filament for about 0.1  seconds . for dna",
    ", this interval corresponds to a fraction of a millisecond .",
    "temporal persistence of racquet structures was seen throughout the simulations , suggesting that metastable intermediates are a general feature in this collapse .",
    "presumably , energy barriers between intermediates are responsible for their local ( meta-)stability but we have not attempted to estimate their size .",
    "the dynamical simulations  @xcite suggest that the mechanism of collapse of semiflexible chains generically involves transitions through a series of long - lived intermediate states . in the absence of thermal fluctuations",
    "these intermediates anneal to certain underlying shapes which are well - defined and allow a straight - forward calculation of their conformational energies .",
    "the crucial element in the underlying shapes is a characteristic looped section which we call a racquet head . for the single racquet , the shape of the head ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : annealed ] ) was produced in the simulation by annealing . while missing the effects of thermal undulations , our calculations of the conformational energies and detailed shapes of the annealed intermediates provide an insightful framework for understanding the simulation results .",
    "annealed shape of a racquet head from the bd simulation , achieved by slowly lowering the effective temperature once the structure has formed .",
    "the shape coincides with the analytical curve to within a line width . ]    in order to simplify the reference to specific states , we label all racquet states by their number of looped sections . thus the rod is the @xmath11 state , the racquet with a single loop at one end the @xmath12 , and so forth , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we refer to the loop formed at the ends of the structure as the `` head '' and to the bundle of filaments connecting heads as the `` neck '' . for the moment we neglect the more subtle question of the exact location of filament ends .",
    "naively one might assume that filament ends coincide with the ends of the neck , since it is straight ; that is , the ends of the filament are expected to span the entire neck as they incur no bending penalty , but generally gain from increasing their overlap .",
    "the picture as described provides an adequate starting point for labeling the states we consider here . among the shapes indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] we distinguish two basic racquet symmetries : even and odd total numbers of heads @xmath13 . for racquets with even @xmath13 , the number of overlaps in the head sections is equal on the two sides , @xmath14 . for racquets with odd @xmath13 , one side ( we arbitrarily call it the left , following fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) has one less @xmath15 than the other : @xmath16 . as a consequence , the filament ends of an even racquet are on opposite sides of the neck .    note that the dynamical simulations modeled the case of fixed experimental conditions after the solvent quench .",
    "the polymer chain is merely exploring a given conformational energy landscape via thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , it can be instructive to consider as a _",
    "gedankenexperiment _ the case of variable filament length , and we use this perspective in our discussion .",
    "a ( reduced ) chain length is also a natural independent variable for the presentation and comparison of states . in this alternative perspective , the evolution of shapes starts with a short filament that gradually lengthens . at first , only the neck grows until the formation of a new head is favored .",
    "the incremental unit of growth between conformations thus consists of one head plus one neck segment .",
    "this procedure can be continued to arbitrary @xmath13 given enough filament . in section",
    "[ sec : dimensionless ] we will see that the appropriate formulation of the problem accomplishes changes in the ( effective ) filament length by adjusting the solvent quality instead of the actual chain length .",
    "schematic `` family '' of racquet states",
    ". the rod can be thought of as a trivial racquet without head ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "all subsequent states are labeled by their numbers of head sections . ]    in the simulations , the actual transition into the torus state could not be resolved in detail .",
    "it is clear however that there are in principle at least two ways in which a loop can form : two chain segments can meet with their tangent angles at an angle of @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the former case leads to a racquet head , while the latter makes a ring that allows the chain to wind up into a torus directly .",
    "since it is more likely for a stiff chain to bend into the smaller angle , one would expect the transition to racquets to be favored , at least for short chains .",
    "statistically , the simulations  @xcite confirm this .",
    "most of the chains studied there were relatively short ( less than 10 persistence lengths ) though a few examples ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : longchain ] ) of longer chains showed qualitatively similar behavior but with increased complexity , such as the display of superstructures of racquets within racquets .",
    "early stages in the evolution of a long chain ( 300-mer , roughly @xmath19 ) showing combinations of the conformational elements seen in shorter chains . ]",
    "having discussed the basic morphology of the intermediate states ,",
    "we turn to the calculation of their conformational energies in the absence of thermal undulations . racquet and torus conformations at zero temperature can be thought of as the underlying shapes , which become modified by fluctuations at finite temperatures .",
    "apart from the bending contributions to the conformational energies , we need to describe the nature of the surface energy by which we model the poor solvent conditions that induce condensation .",
    "this surface energy assumes the packing or bundling of filaments in a hexagonal lattice ( in cross section ) and distinguishes between polymer and solvent exposure .",
    "the local arrangement into a hexagonal columnar phase has been confirmed for example by x - ray diffraction applied to bundles of dna and other charged polymer chains  @xcite and the detailed structure within bundles of semiflexible polymer chains has been studied theoretically  @xcite .",
    "our calculations describe the simplified model with filaments of vanishing thickness ( compared to other length scales in the problem ) , while we model their packing on a perfect hexagonal lattice .",
    "thus we do not take into account any winding defects due to topological constraints or variations in curvature due to the finite filament thickness .",
    "as implicit in the description of a worm - like chain , we assume a uniform bending modulus . in the torus state ,",
    "such an ideal chain forms a circular ring with a single radius of curvature .",
    "furthermore , we assume for both racquet heads and torus that partial filament overhang , an effective non - uniformity in the bending modulus , does not change their shape but only their size . neglecting these higher order corrections",
    "is certainly justified in the limit that the bundling number @xmath13 gets large .      in a hexagonally close - packed bundle ,",
    "each filament in cross section can be thought of as having six sites occupied by either solvent or polymer .",
    "the poor solvent lowers the energy for polymer - polymer relative to polymer - solvent contacts . to express the fact that there is a _ relative _ energetic advantage for filaments to bundle versus being exposed to solvent",
    ", we explicitly evaluate the total number of solvent - exposed sites and express the energy as a surface tension .",
    "particular surface energies are evaluated as follows . to find the coordination number @xmath20 for an @xmath13 bundle ,",
    "consider the total number of surfaces or binding sites in the bundle with hexagonal order ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this number is proportional to the energy of @xmath13 individual filaments completely exposed to solvent . to account for the effect of bundling",
    ", we note that a bond corresponds to the merging of two binding sites on neighboring filaments .",
    "we thus subtract the number of bonds formed from only half the number of sites ( @xmath22 ) to find the coordination number @xmath20 . as an example of this numerology consider the cases for @xmath23 and 10 : for 5 filaments there are 7 bonds , resulting in a coordination of 8 , while 10 filaments make 19 bonds and thus have a coordination of 11 . multiplying by the surface tension parameter @xmath24 finally yields the surface energy per unit length for such a bundle .",
    "differences between subsequent @xmath20 are always either zero or one ( except between @xmath12 and 2 ) .",
    "this creates non - uniformities in the effective binding strengths per unit length , thus favoring particular bundling numbers .",
    "we expect this effect for @xmath13 with the same coordination as their predecessor ( @xmath25 ) but a coordination of one less than the @xmath26 bundle ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is the case whenever an added filament adds three instead of two bonds , thereby filling a shell",
    ". examples of this situation are found for @xmath28 and we refer to them as `` magic '' numbers or filled shells .",
    "cross sections of magic number bundles correspond to arrangements with high degrees of symmetry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hexpack ] .    bundle cross sections of the lowest magic numbers on a hexagonal lattice .",
    "note the arrangements of the``supermagic '' numbers 7 and 19 into perfect hexagons . ]",
    "a few `` supermagic '' numbers ( @xmath29 ) represent bundles with the special symmetry of the equilateral hexagon ; we will not treat these cases separately . in agreement with pereira and williams",
    "@xcite we find that bundles of magic numbers ( and particularly the supermagic ones ) play the role of preferred states with increased stability .      the formulation of the problem as presented contains a characteristic length scale which greatly simplifies the discussion and presentation of our results .",
    "balancing expressions for typical bending and surface energies @xmath30 for a given filament length @xmath31 defines a measure we call the _ condensation length _ @xmath32 .",
    "its role in the behavior of a chain under particular conditions is the following : given the physical parameters @xmath33 and @xmath24 a filament much shorter than @xmath34 will rarely self - intersect and therefore typically form an extended structure , while one much longer than @xmath34 is likely dominated by overlaps and will form collapsed or at least partially collapsed ( intermediate ) structures .",
    "another combination of the two basic parameters @xmath33 and @xmath24 sets an analogous energy scale , the _ condensation energy _ @xmath35 . with these measures , all",
    "conformational energies @xmath36 can be presented in dimensionless units , where physical energies and lengths are normalized by their condensation values : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this formulation also provides a convenient ( experimental ) realization of `` changing the filament length '' . we can vary the reduced length @xmath39 by adjusting the values of @xmath33 and @xmath24 independently",
    "we describe a torus by the following two ( dimensionless ) variables : a filament of length @xmath39 is wound into a circle of constant radius @xmath40 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : torussketch ] . in general",
    ", the torus can have any number @xmath13 of complete windings ( through an angle @xmath18 ) and an amount of extra overhang @xmath41 subject to the condition @xmath42 .",
    "since the entire filament contour length @xmath39 has a constant curvature , the bending contribution to the conformational energy is always @xmath43 .",
    "sketch of a generic torus ( here a 1 + in our labeling scheme ) of radius @xmath40 and overhang @xmath41 . ]",
    "we find it convenient to distinguish forms of the torus with different numbers of complete revolution @xmath13 defined as the largest integer in @xmath44 .",
    "any non - integer portion of this ratio represents overhang of filament beyond complete windings , defined as @xmath45 .",
    "our distinction of different tori by @xmath13 naturally separates cases with different coordination numbers and thus different surface energies . in anticipation of an important distinction that emerges",
    ", we call a torus without extra overhang ( @xmath46 ) an `` exact @xmath13 '' while we refer to the generic torus with finite overhang ( @xmath47 ) as an `` @xmath48 '' .    for the torus",
    "as described , we can then write down the following expression for its total conformational energy @xmath49 + \\sigma\\:[\\alpha_{n+1 } - \\alpha_n]\\ ] ] with the common bending term followed by two surface terms describing the contributions from the complete @xmath13-fold ring and the extra piece of overhang @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "substituting for @xmath41 leads to the torus energy in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 only , which allows us to find the equilibrium size or radius @xmath50 for a particular state @xmath13 by minimization with respect to @xmath40 : note that @xmath51 is positive everywhere .",
    "resubstitution of @xmath50 yields the conformational energy @xmath52 in terms of the single variable @xmath39 .",
    "the expressions found in this way are valid in the ranges of @xmath39 between @xmath13 and @xmath53 times the circumference @xmath54 .",
    "however , a real solution for this equilibrium size need not exist .",
    "this happens exactly for the magic numbers with @xmath55 .",
    "when a real solution for the equilibrium radius does exist , the resulting energy has two terms : one proportional to @xmath56 , the other to @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term is the combination of coordination numbers ( @xmath57 ) which can vanish for @xmath13 just below the magic numbers ( at @xmath58 ) leaving these cases with the functional dependence @xmath56 only .",
    "another consequence of the numerology of hexagonal packing is that different states @xmath13 can share the same energy expressions .",
    "examples are the series @xmath59 and the pairs @xmath60  these cases form a particular class of transitions where @xmath41 grows continuously with @xmath39 .      the above method for finding the optimal torus sizes by minimizing the conformational energy represents the conventional approach to determine metastability . however , there is a somewhat unusual aspect to the problem at hand .",
    "the energy expressions for torus states with different @xmath13 are in general not the same .",
    "this introduces discontinuities in the form of the energy between adjacent states .",
    "consequently , there are not only the conventional minima identified by their vanishing slopes but also another class of solutions with discontinuities in slope at points where the energy expressions to the left and right differ due to the filament coordination .",
    "these are not minima in the usual sense ( for instance , they are not locally quadratic minima ) ; they are stabilized by finite slopes on both sides and do not have the usual signature of a vanishing slope .",
    "our results for the tori are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : toroids ] .",
    "conformational energies of the torus states as a function of filament length in reduced units .",
    "the thinner lines indicate ( metastable ) solutions in regions where they are not the ground state , which in turn is indicated by bold segments .",
    "the dashed line shows the large @xmath13 solution calculated in section  [ subsec : torus_scaling ] . ]    in order to establish the metastability of the tori of different @xmath13 in more detail , we consider the behavior of the energy derivatives with respect to the radius @xmath61 evaluated at the radii where the exact @xmath13 and @xmath53 form .",
    "these derivatives are all monotonic functions ( functional dependence : @xmath62 ) with at most a single zero indicating a limit of metastability . around these zeroes ,",
    "the derivative is generically negative to the left and positive to the right .",
    "when negative , the energy is lowered by increasing the radius @xmath40 , thus driving any overhang @xmath41 to vanish and making the torus an exact @xmath13 . when positive , the opposite is true , driving @xmath41 to grow , making the torus an @xmath48 .",
    "note that there are cases ( notably again for the magic numbers with @xmath55 ) where @xmath63 is negative everywhere .",
    "these cases form an important class in which tori never evolve ( with increasing @xmath39 ) towards states with finite overhangs : they remain metastable ( with complete or exact overlap ) for all lengths beyond some lower limit .",
    "the relative positions of the zeroes in the energy derivatives combine in two fundamental ways , resulting in exact and @xmath48 tori for various ranges of @xmath39 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the various cases can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the rod ( @xmath11 ) is of course a special ( trivial ) case without any bending contribution . due to the absence of any competition between bending and self - affinity ,",
    "the rod is ( at least ) metastable for all lengths and follows a straight line .",
    "the lower limit of the 1 + state is given by the circumference of a single ring that just closes ( @xmath64 ) , a circle with the radius of a condensation length .",
    "the subsequent small @xmath13 states show variations depending on the numerology of the hexagonal coordination numbers . for larger @xmath13",
    "a perhaps generic type of series emerges where @xmath48 become exact @xmath53 which remain metastable to infinity .",
    "thus , in contrast to what we have emphasized here by treating only cases with relatively small @xmath13 in detail , there appear to be only the few tori with @xmath13 below 12 that show variations to the generic pattern of exact ( magic @xmath13 ) tori without extra overhangs .",

    "as @xmath13 grows large , we can neglect such details as partial overhangs ( finite @xmath41 ) since differences between @xmath13 and @xmath53 vanish as @xmath70 .",
    "we assume first that the torus is a perfect cylinder with circular cross section .",

    "we assume that the torus formed has both a perfect hexagonal cross section and an integer winding number ( no partial overhangs ) .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable : it can be shown by direct calculation that the surface tension for a fixed number of filaments on a triangular lattice is smaller for the hexagonal than for the circular cross section .",
    "this is analogous to a wulff construction  @xcite which captures , for instance , the faceting of crystals in solid state physics .",
    "the integer winding number is justified since the difference in the surface energies between @xmath13 and @xmath53 filaments vanishes as @xmath13 becomes very large .",
