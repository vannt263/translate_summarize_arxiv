    "the primary goal of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) mission @xcite is to study the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , an undertaking that requires detailed knowledge of the instrumental angular response and noise , low systematic errors , and absolute calibration at sub - percent levels .",
    "these attributes make _ wmap _  data of natural interest for ancillary studies of sky - based calibration objects .",
    "this paper focuses on _ wmap _   observations of selected planets and fixed celestial objects which have been commonly used as calibrators in the microwave , either by ground- or space - based instruments .",
    "we provide fundamental measurements for these objects which will be of use not only for calibration purposes , but also other studies , such as planetary radiative transfer .    a brief discussion of _ wmap _  planetary radiometric data was made by @xcite , with an earlier discussion of jupiter temperatures by @xcite .",
    "we extend these presentations to include _ wmap _  observations of mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune over a seven - year interval ( 2001 - 2008 ) , in five microwave passbands ranging from @xmath423 to 94  ghz .",
    "we also select five bright celestial sources for more detailed study : cas  a , cyg  a , tau  a , 3c58 and 3c274 .",
    "the _ wmap _  project routinely compiles and distributes a point source catalog , which tabulates mean flux values in those same five passbands for bright sources off the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "however , four of the five objects discussed here ( cas  a , tau  a , cyg  a , 3c 58 ) have low galactic latitudes and are not included in the catalog .",
    "an earlier analysis of three - year _ wmap _  tau  a observations by @xcite included both intensity and linear polarization measurements .",
    "this paper is one of a suite that details the analysis of _ wmap _  seven - year data .",
    "an overview and description of data processing methods is provided by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss galactic foregrounds and techniques for removing them ; an updated point source catalog is included .",
    "analysis of cmb power spectra , best fit models and cosmological interpretations are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite assess potential cmb `` anomalies '' relative to the best - fit six parameter @xmath5cdm model .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : a short discussion of the _ wmap _  instrument , plus data strengths and limitations for calibration source work , is provided in section  [ sec : wmapintro ] .",
    "the paper then divides into two major sections : analysis and results for planets ( section  [ sec : planets ] ) , and then section  [ sec : celsrc ] discusses analysis methods and results for the five bright celestial sources . a closing summary and conclusions follow in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "since its arrival at the earth - sun l2 point in 2001 august , _ wmap _   has produced a well - calibrated , multi - wavelength microwave survey of the entire sky with high sampling redundancy .",
    "detailed descriptions of the mission profile and hardware can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . to assist with clarifying the terminology and analysis methods presented in this paper",
    ", we describe the key features of the mission .",
    "_ wmap _  observes the sky differentially : signal from the sky is simultaneously sampled in two different directions @xmath6 apart and guided by 10 feed horn pairs into 10 receivers , referred to as differencing assemblies ( das ) .",
    "the receivers cover five frequency bands ( k , ka , q , v and w ) with approximate center frequencies of @xmath423 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94  ghz , respectively .",
    "there is one da each for k and ka bands ( k1 , ka1 ) , two das each for q and v bands ( q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 ) and four das ( w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 ) for w band .",
    "the frequency passbands are broad ( @xmath7 fractional bandwidth ) , so that the exact frequency associated with an observation depends on the source spectrum .",
    "an orthomode transducer at the throat of each feed separates the sky signal into two orthogonal polarizations , allowing for reconstruction of both intensity and linear polarization signals .",
    "angular resolution is moderate , ranging from roughly @xmath8 fwhm in w band to @xmath9 fwhm in k band .    as a survey mission , _ wmap _",
    "is not commanded to point at specific targets , but executes a pole - to - pole sky - scanning strategy whose position on the ecliptic advances @xmath10 each day . to facilitate high redundancy in sky coverage",
    ", the spacecraft rotates about a spin axis , which also precesses .",
    "these combined motions produce a @xmath11 wide scan swath which looks like a `` belt '' projected onto the sky , passing through the ecliptic poles .",
    "the scan swath returns to its original starting position on the ecliptic every year , after completing a full - sky survey with multiple observations per sky pixel .    a primary strength of _ wmap _  data is the calibration accuracy , with an absolute calibration error of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the absolute calibration is tied to knowledge of the cmb monopole and the spacecraft orbital velocity , and thus is independent of any reliance on previously established measurements of the sources under study . when coupled with _ wmap _ s temporal and spectral coverage , the accurate flux measurements can provide a useful measure of intrinsic or geometrically induced source variability .",
    "there are some limiting factors , however .",
    "temporal coverage of an object is constrained by the sky - scanning method .",
    "for a fixed source on the ecliptic , the _ wmap _  scan strategy provides for two @xmath13-day windows a year in which to observe that source .",
    "these `` observing seasons '' are spaced roughly six months apart .",
    "while this geometry is modified somewhat for moving objects , only mars is near enough that the orbital motion can extend a single viewing window from 45 days to as much as 60 to 90 days . since _ wmap _",
    "does not dwell on an object , but simply scans as it passes through the viewing swath , the number of observations for an individual object is also limited , which affects the signal - to - noise . finally , _",
    "s moderate spatial resolution , which allows us to characterize the planets as calibrators , also places detailed knowledge of structures such as saturn s rings beyond instrument capabilities .",
    "there are five planets with sufficient signal - to - noise for analysis . listed in order of decreasing signal - to - noise ,",
    "these are jupiter , saturn , mars , uranus and neptune . since _ wmap _",
    "points away from the sun , earth and moon in its l2 orbit , it can not observe mercury or venus .",
    "planets are excluded from the standard map - based products used for _ wmap _  studies of the cmb and galactic foregrounds .",
    "observations of the planets must be extracted from the calibrated time - ordered data ( tod ) , and then undergo quality assessment and background removal before they can be analyzed .",
    "the extraction process gathers all observations from the tod taken within several degrees of each planet and associates ancillary information such as position in the focal plane , attitude , planet viewing aspect and data quality flags with each observation .",
    "observations whose sky positions lie within a @xmath14 radius of other planets or which are of suspect quality are immediately rejected .",
    "in addition , observations are excluded from use if either beam of a da feed - horn pair samples sky coordinates that fall within the boundaries of a spatial processing mask @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this `` galactic masking '' is to mitigate background removal error by excluding observations located near strong - signal , high - gradient regions of the galaxy . for those observations which survive these quality control steps ,",
    "galactic and cmb background signals are subtracted .",
    "the background signal subtracted from each observation is computed from the da - appropriate seven - year mean map ( from which planetary data were excluded ) , using the value from the @xmath15 wide pixel which is closest in spatial coordinates to those of the time - ordered observation .",
    "table  [ tab : planetseasons ] lists the beginning and ending dates of the observing seasons for the five planets , i.e. , when they are directly in the _ wmap _  viewing swath .",
    "the `` sky proximity '' column in the table indicate probable reasons for an unusually high rejection of observations within a season .    as noted in @xcite , planets are `` point sources '' for _ wmap _ and thus the brightness temperature of a planet @xmath16 can be computed via the relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the peak response observed by _",
    "wmap _ , @xmath19 is the main - beam solid angle , and @xmath20 is the solid angle subtended by the planet . changing distance between the planet and _ wmap _ , plus changes in viewing aspect of an oblate planet , will cause @xmath20 ( and also @xmath18 ) to vary with time",
    ". we account for both geometrical effects and compute the brightness temperature relative to a fiducial solid angle @xmath21 via the use of time - dependent geometrical scaling factors @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the factors",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 may be thought of as `` distance correction '' and `` disk oblateness correction '' factors :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are a fixed fiducial disk area and distance , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the projected area of the planetary disk , and @xmath28 the distance of the planet from _",
    ", at the time of each observation .",
    "the projected area of the oblate disk is computed from @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the planet s equatorial radius and @xmath31 is the projected polar radius given by @xmath32^{1/2 } ,    \\label{eq : projrad}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the planetary latitude of _ wmap _  ( `` sub-_wmap _  latitude '' ) .",
    "the fiducial disk area @xmath25 is simply @xmath27 evaluated at @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "planetary radii and north pole directions used to compute @xmath33 are adopted from @xcite ; the polar and equatorial radii are listed in table  [ tab : radii ] . because _ wmap _",
    "is at l2 , @xmath33 is not very dissimilar to that of the sub - earth latitude , @xmath36 .",
    "as the brightest `` point source '' visible to _ wmap _ , jupiter is used to characterize the main beam response of the instrument .",
    "this process and analysis are described in detail in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the end result is a set of seven - year , azimuthally - symmetrized , one - dimensional radial beam profiles per da .",
    "these radial beam profiles are then used to derive window functions used for cmb power spectrum deconvolution .",
    "unlike the rest of the planetary temperatures in this section , the seven - year mean jupiter temperatures are derived from the @xmath37 value of the unnormalized window functions ( which measures @xmath38 ) , coupled with the fiducial solid angle for jupiter @xcite . for all other planetary analysis ,",
    "brightness temperatures are derived using a template - fitting technique , which takes advantage of the high - quality beam information obtained from seven years of jupiter observations .",
    "after the processing steps described above , radial response profiles are produced for each planet , per da , per season , by assigning observations to 0.25 arcmin bins increasing in angular distance from the planet s center .",
    "each bin is assigned a mean value and an error based on instrument noise appropriate to the number of observations within the bin .",
    "the known radial beam response , based on seven - year jupiter data , is used as a fitting template to the seasonal radial profile for each da .",
    "the fit returns @xmath18 for the planet .",
    "the brightness temperature is then derived from @xmath18 , the main - beam solid angle @xcite and the reference solid angle for the planet as per the above equations .",
    "errors include the formal error in the template coefficient and the propagated error in the beam solid angle .",
    "figure  [ fig : radialprofiles ] illustrates sample w1 radial profiles for a single observing season for each of the planets .",
    "the beam template is overplotted in red .",
    "as well as illustrating the technique , the figure is also a useful comparator of signal quality for each planet at w - band .",
    "beam dilution increases with decreasing _",
    "frequency : @xmath39 is roughly 24.6 , 14.4 , 8.98 , 4.20 and 2.10 @xmath40 sr for the k - w bands respectively @xcite .",
    "tabulated brightness temperatures are appropriate for the rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) approximation .",
    "brightness temperatures provided in the tables do not include the cmb contribution blocked by the planet but included in the background .",
    "as noted in the tables , absolute brightness temperature is obtained by adding 2.2 , 2.0 , 1.9 , 1.5 and 1.1 k in bands k , ka , q , v and w respectively @xcite , since in the rj approximation the cmb temperatures are frequency dependent .",
    "_ wmap _  data points shown in comparison to measurements in the literature are converted to absolute brightness .",
    "jupiter is a bright , accessible source whose whole - disk observations have long been used for calibration in the infrared through radio . @xcite",
    "recommend the use of _ wmap _  radiometry of jupiter as the preferred method of transferring the _ wmap _  dipole calibration to another microwave instrument .",
    "for some instruments , jupiter is unfortunately too bright , hence the interest in the use of fainter sources , and a set of observations which tie several common sources together on the same calibration scale .",
    "we continue to recommend jupiter as the primary comparison calibrator , however .",
    "seven - year mean brightness temperatures for jupiter , computed as described in section  [ sec : methods ] , are presented in table  [ tab : juptemp ] .",
    "the seven - year values differ from those of the five - year analysis of @xcite by @xmath0 or less .",
    "the largest changes , which hover near @xmath0 , are for k band and some of the w band das . a detailed explanation of these changes is given in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the change in k band results from improved background subtraction , and the w band changes are driven by small revisions to the beam solid angles , based on modeling .",
    "the seven - year temperatures for w band show a decreased scatter between the individual das compared to five - year , implying an improved calibration .",
    "the jupiter temperature uncertainties listed in table  [ tab : juptemp ] are derived from the quadrature sum of the solid angle error and absolute calibration error of @xmath12 @xcite , as they were in the five - year analysis .",
    "thermal emission from jupiter s atmosphere is the primary signal source at wavelengths spanned by _",
    "wmap_. as such , the observations are helpful for providing constraints on atmospheric models for jupiter , which in turn could be used for calibration purposes",
    ". however , as noted by e.g. , @xcite , there is a fine point to consider : small contributions to the total observed intensity from a synchrotron component up to about 40  ghz are expected .",
    "this non - thermal `` decimetric emission '' arises from charged particles trapped close to jupiter by its strong magnetic field , and dominates the spectrum at frequencies less than about 3  ghz .",
    "estimates in the literature place the synchrotron contribution at 23 ghz near 1% of the total intensity @xcite , with a roughly @xmath41 frequency dependence @xcite . however , the synchrotron emission is known to be variable on a wide range of time scales @xcite , and accurate removal is difficult .",
    "seven - year mean jupiter brightness temperatures are graphically compared against those in the literature in figure  [ fig : jupspec ] .",
    "ground - based observational values are taken from compilations of @xcite and @xcite , along with individual observations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "estimates of the synchrotron emission have been removed from the observations in the figure by many , but not all , of the authors , and not necessarily to the same level .",
    "observations are plotted `` as observed '' .    as an estimate of the stability of jupiter s emission with orbital phase over the seven - year interval , we extend the five - year analysis of @xcite , in which temperatures for individual jupiter observing seasons are computed and compared to the multi - year mean values . individual seasonal temperatures",
    "are derived using the same beam - profile fitting technique which is used for the other planets ( section  [ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "we compute @xmath42 as the mean deviation of all das from their seven - year mean values , and include a @xmath0 standard deviation as a measure of coherency .",
    "these results are listed in table  [ tab : juptime ] . using the _ wmap _  five - year data , @xcite quote an upper limit of @xmath43 based on the largest deviation and scatter seen in the first 10 observing seasons , which occurred in season four . a careful examination of the entries in table  [ tab : juptime ] with the largest deviations and/or scatter ( observing seasons 4 , 11 , 12 ) shows that these particular instances have more to do with template fitting and background subtraction quality than with intrinsic source variability . the two seasons with high scatter ( 4 , 12 )",
    "are those in which the number of available observations for fitting has been significantly reduced because of foreground masking ( `` % masked '' in the table ) , which increases the statistical error in the temperature determination .",
    "season 11 , with the highest @xmath42 , is one in which jupiter is nearly aligned with the galactic center , but outside the processing mask .",
    "this is a region in which background subtraction is subject to greater error because of higher temperature gradients across the pixels in the map used for background removal .",
    "if one ignores these three entries , then an upper limit of @xmath1 is more appropriate .",
    "we also searched for indications that k band might be more intrinsically variable than w band , because of the small synchrotron contribution .",
    "there is no indication of such a frequency dependence in the data , but the upper envelope here is about 0.5% .",
    "the _ wmap _  jupiter observations were analyzed to determine if any linear polarization signal could be detected .",
    "a special version of the beam mapping software was run for jupiter , in which the angle between the polarization axis of each radiometer and the planet s magnetic dipole was computed for each observation . for each differencing assembly , all observations within a tight radius of beam center were accumulated , corrected to peak beam response , background subtracted , loss imbalance corrected , separated by radiometer , and then used to solve for stokes parameters i , q , u and their errors . for a more complete description of the relevant equations , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "normalized stokes parameters q / i and u / i are reported in table  [ tab : juppoln ] , along with their propagated errors and estimated linear polarization fraction , @xmath44 .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct for noise bias in either @xmath45 or its reported error , which is simply the propagated error .",
    "the estimated signal - to - noise is low , with no significant detections in any differencing assembly .",
    "linear polarization of the synchrotron emission at 15 and 22  ghz has been detected by @xcite using the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "they were unable to obtain a synchrotron polarization fraction at 22  ghz , but estimated 20% polarization based on the 15  ghz observations , which implies roughly a 0.2% polarization fraction at k band using a combined thermal and non - thermal intensity .",
    "_  results are consistent with this estimate , but do not provide any further constraint .",
    "mars value as a calibrator depends upon the accuracy to which its whole - disk brightness variations ( both apparent and intrinsic ) can be modeled . much of the perceived variability from earth - orbit is attributable to geometrical factors : the apparent phase as seen by the observer and changes in solar irradiance as mars distance from the sun varies in its elliptical orbit @xcite .",
    "there are a number of additional complexities , however .",
    "the day / night cycle imparts a significant rotational modulation to the observed temperature as the surface heats and cools . in the infrared , variable atmospheric effects including molecular line absorption and dust storms",
    "can be of importance . additionally , the martian surface is itself far from homogenous , with polar ice - caps of changing extent and variations in albedo and thermal inertia on relatively small scales @xcite .",
    "planetary science studies notwithstanding , the astronomical community has most consistently referenced two basic models when calibrating to mars : the `` wright model '' ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the `` rudy model '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) , both developed before the current level of detail available from orbiters such as mars global surveyor ( mgs ) . in the thermal emission regime ( @xmath46 ) , the planet s brightness temperature can be computed to first order as re - emission of absorbed solar energy by a surface layer with a characteristic albedo , emissivity and thermal inertia @xcite .",
    "the wright model uses this approach to predict thermal emission in the 10 - 350  range , with no positional variations of parameters such as albedo and thermal inertia .",
    "the rudy model originates from vla observations at 2 and 6  cm , which sample further into the martian subsurface .",
    "concurrent measurements of the polarized flux are used to estimate radio reflectivities and absorption lengths as a function of planetary latitude , and brightness temperatures calculated via radiative transfer as a function of position on a longitude / latitude grid .",
    "typical errors on @xmath47 quoted for the wright model are @xmath48 , or about @xmath49k , and those for the rudy model at 5%-10% .",
    "we have chosen in this paper to compare the _ wmap _  observations against predictions from the wright model , primarily because of its long history of use and readily available model code @xcite , but also because the seasonal brightness temperatures quoted for _ wmap _  are the resultant average over several weeks of data , which means we are only sampling mean properties at best .",
    "we have modified the 2007 wright model code in three ways : ( 1 ) jpl ephemeris positions are substituted for the lower precision formulae originally used ; ( 2 ) an option is added to use _ wmap _  spacecraft positions rather than those of the earth ; and ( 3 ) computations are extended out to _ wmap _  frequencies .",
    "the first two changes are not critical to the analysis , as the combined modifications introduce at most at 0.6  k difference from the original results .",
    "typically the model predicts brightness temperatures at 3  mm which are a few kelvins lower than those at 350  , and the temperature spread between the extrema of the 5 _ wmap _  frequencies is quite low , of order 0.5 k.    @xcite presented the first five years of _ wmap _  mars observations at 94  ghz .",
    "here we extend the w - band observations to seven years , and include the observations at the other four _ wmap _  frequencies .",
    "mean brightness temperatures for mars at five frequencies and seven _ wmap _  observing seasons derived from the seven - year data are presented in table  [ tab : mars ] .",
    "after correcting to absolute brightness temperature and converting from rayleigh - jeans to planck brightness temperature , the seven seasonal w - band averages are shown in comparison to the wright model predictions at 3.2  mm in figure  [ fig : marswband ] .",
    "this plot is similar to figure  15 of @xcite , whose preliminary analysis found that the wright model was a good predictor of the mean temporal variation , but the model @xmath50 seemed high by roughly 10% .",
    "our results generally agree , but we find that multiplying the wright model by a factor of @xmath51 fits the seven - year data best .",
    "if one uses the wright model tabulated at 350 , the plot looks nearly identical , but the scaling factor is 0.941 , or about a 6% reduction .",
    "a previous comparison by @xcite indicated that the 3  mm whole - disk observations of @xcite were within 7.5% of wright model predictions at 350 . the first _ wmap _",
    "mars observing season occurred during the time of the 2001 july - october massive global dust storm which elevated atmospheric temperatures in the mid - ir by nearly 40  k @xcite .",
    "the effect of dust storms on microwave data is expected to be less of a concern , but we did fit for the model scaling factor both with and without inclusion of the first observing season , with no significantly different results .    the uncertainties on the derived _ wmap _  seasonal brightness temperatures increase with decreasing frequency , which follows as a result of decreasing signal - to - noise in the data .",
    "however , it is possible to extract a trend in temperature with frequency by finding within each season the ratio of the brightness temperature at each frequency to that at w band , and then computing the mean over all seven observing seasons as a function of frequency .",
    "these means are plotted in figure  [ fig : marsfreqdep ] in black .",
    "errors are standard deviations of the mean .",
    "the weak frequency dependence can be characterized roughly as @xmath52 , indicated by the blue line .",
    "the wright model , processed in the same fashion , predicts almost no variation with frequency ( red line ) . such a frequency dependence could be attributed to an emissivity change of @xmath53 over the wavelength interval . in a similar vein , a weak @xmath54 decline in surface emissivity with increasing wavelength was noted by @xcite in the 50 to 180  range , based on analysis of infrared space observatory ( iso ) observations of water vapor absorption lines .",
    "some consideration was given to placing the _ wmap _  observations in a wider context , with the goal of gaining further insight into the model parameters .",
    "a search was made for a dataset that would provide absolutely calibrated , whole - disk observations of mars which spanned both sides of the thermal energy distribution peak and were taken over a reasonably contiguous interval of time .",
    "mars data taken by the cobe / dirbe instrument @xcite for a 146 day interval ( 1990 april 28 - september 20 ) most closely matched these requirements , although no analysis of the publicly available   data appears to have been previously published .",
    "there are six dirbe wavebands which sample the thermal emission portion of the mars spectrum , with effective wavelengths of 12 , 25 , 60 , 100 , 140 and 240 . of these",
    ", the 25   observations can not be used as an independent check of the wright model , since the model itself was the ultimate source of the dirbe absolute calibration in this band ( s.  moseley & w.  glaccum 2009 , private communication , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , while the 12 , 25 , 140 and 240   detectors are well - behaved linear devices , the 60 and 100  detectors are known to suffer non - linear response , and mars is on the bright end of that response .",
    "dirbe is a broad - band photometer , and reports monochromatic flux values at the effective wavelength of each band assuming a constant source spectrum in @xmath55 across the band .",
    "one must apply a `` color correction factor '' to the reported fluxes if the source spectrum is different from that assumed .",
    "the dirbe explanatory supplement provides such factors for gray - body and power - law spectra .",
    "however , in the case of mars , some of the dirbe bands intercept known atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "a significant co@xmath56 absorption centered at 15  lies well within the 12  passband , and grazes the blue edge of the 25   band .",
    "numerous minor water vapor absorptions are known to occur at wavelengths sampled by the 60 and 100  bands @xcite .",
    "we have used spectral data available from the mgs thermal emission spectrograph ( tes ) public archives   and the iso spectrum published by @xcite to form approximate correction factors for the dirbe data at these bands : only the 12  band required significant correction .",
    "for the 140 and 240  bands , color corrections were calculated using the spectrum predicted by the wright model .",
    "a mean flux at each dirbe effective wavelength was evaluated over the 146 day interval , including application of color corrections and scaling to a fiducial solid angle at a distance of 1.5 au ( table  [ tab : dirbemars ] ) .",
    "although the epochs of _ wmap _  and dirbe observations are separated by more than 10 years , the viewing geometry at the time of the dirbe observations is most closely duplicated during _ wmap _  observing season four .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "mean brightness temperatures for this season were also converted to fluxes using the same fiducial solid angle , and both sets of data plotted as a spectrum in figure  [ fig : marsdirbecomp ] .",
    "the spectra predicted by the wright model for the mean time of the two epochs are also shown on the plot .",
    "for clarity , the quoted model errors of about @xmath48 are not shown on the plot .",
    "on the logarithmic scale needed to show both sets of data together , the two model spectra overlay each other . within the quoted data and model errors , the dirbe measurements at 60 and 100   do not match well with the model .",
    "the dirbe 12  data deviate by a little more than @xmath0 , accounting for both data errors and model accuracy . in the case of the 60 and 100  bands ,",
    "we suspect a non - linear response to a bright object is the root cause .",
    "the 12  band has a low absolute calibration error , but there is a significant and uncertain color correction due to the co@xmath56 atmospheric absorption",
    ". ratios of the dirbe fluxes to wright model predictions are presented in table  [ tab : dirbemars ] ; the major source of dirbe error is that of the absolute calibration , which is also listed .",
    "dirbe observations at 140 and 240  agree within the 10% calibration errors , but can not be used to deduce any trend with frequency , such as seen by _",
    "wmap_. we decided to forgo adjustments to the model at this point .",
    "as currently implemented , the wright model may be used to predict microwave observations at _ wmap _  frequencies by applying a `` post - processing '' multiplicative scaling factor to the published values : @xmath57 . for both model and data evaluated at 3.2  mm ,",
    "we have already noted a scaling factor of 0.953 .",
    "we use the mean ratios of the remaining four frequencies to w band ( figure  [ fig : marsfreqdep ] ) as scaling factors for these frequencies , which are in column  2 of table  [ tab : marsmodelresid ] .",
    "the w - band observations can be reproduced to @xmath58 , with confidence decreasing with frequency to @xmath59 at k band .",
    "since the 3.2  mm model values we have computed are not published , we also provide scaling factors to the 350  temperatures , which are derived from the the scaling factor of 0.941 noted earlier and multiplied through by the 3.2  mm scaling ratios .",
    "differences between measurements and the wright model at _ wmap _  wavelengths are not unexpected .",
    "the wright model was designed to predict infrared emission arising from the top layer of the martian surface , whereas the microwave signal originates from subsurface layers of order several centimeters deep ( @xcite ) , with potentially different composition and compaction .",
    "this was recognized by @xcite and @xcite , who recommended a logarithmic interpolation between the wright 350  prediction and the 3.3  mm brightness temperature versus mars - sun distance fit of @xcite , citing agreement with the rudy model within 1.2% for a dielectric constant revised upward from 2.25 to 2.8 . on average ,",

    "the rings also contribute to the microwave signal via a mix of scattering and thermal re - emission of planetary radiation .",
    "the crossover point between the two emission mechanisms occurs near 1  cm @xcite , with thermal emission dominating shortwards and scattering longwards .",
    "optical depths have been measured at a variety of wavelengths : @xcite found that the optical depth of the combined abc rings is roughly gray over a wide frequency range .",
    "voyager i radio occultation observations @xcite at 3.6 and 13 cm produced radial profiles of optical depth for the a and c rings and cassini division , but only approximate results for portions of the b ring with @xmath61 .",

    "this convenient relationship does not effectively characterize the behavior at lower inclinations , however , and so a more complex formulation is needed for the seven - year data .",
    "we adopt a simple empirical model of saturn s microwave emission , variants of which have appeared in the literature for over 30 years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the goal is to provide a predictive formula for the unresolved observed brightness of saturn with as low an error as possible : however , given the _",

    "they interpreted differences between their 1.3  mm and 3  mm data , taken roughly 4 months apart , as possible evidence for atmospheric changes on week to month timescales . in order to estimate potential model bias caused by the assumption of a uniform disk temperature ,",
    "saturn seasonal brightness temperatures were simulated using geometrical models similar to those described in this section , with the addition of a disk latitudinal gradient as described by @xcite .",
    "if one makes the assumption that such a temperature gradient is persistent over seven years and exists at all _ wmap _  frequencies , then such structure would produce a temperature behavior with inclination which is asymmetric about @xmath88 .",
    "this is because the rings would obscure hotter regions in the northern portion of the disk but colder regions in the south , producing a maximum deviation from symmetry of @xmath60% at the largest ring opening angles . since the _ wmap _  seven - year observations sample slightly less than half of the full @xmath72 range ,",
    "this asymmetry would not be evident , and a model fit which assumes a constant disk temperature would use the ring model component to compensate for the disk temperature gradient . for a simulated dataset matching the _ wmap _  seven - year observing seasons , the model fit returns a mean ring temperature biased by less than 1  k , with an unbiased recovery of the mean whole - disk temperature .",
