    "the continuum is suppressed by a multitude of molecular bands , many of which are gravity sensitive , and hence define a ` pseudo - continuum ' that depends on both temperature and gravity . finding a unique temperature and gravity by comparing to model atmospheres is also problematic ; despite great advancements of models in recent years , missing opacities limit their reliability on a detailed level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the reason that their mass estimates are slightly higher is that @xmath31 measured from gravity sensitive features are used directly , which is an independent method to constrain age and mass . as we have detailed above , however , it is also a difficult method , as a small error in @xmath31 results in a large error in derived age ( and mass ) .",

    "3 .   using our temperature estimates , the assumption that oph1622 is of the same age as other members of the ophiuchus star forming region , and the @xcite evolutionary tracks , we derive component masses of @xmath32m@xmath7 and @xmath8m@xmath7 , where the major uncertainty contribution comes from the age ( assumed to be 110myr ) .",
