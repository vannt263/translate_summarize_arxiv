    "the purpose of this article is to reexamine some formal aspects of the problem of calculating the quantum mechanical tunnel splittings in a smooth , symmetric , one - dimensional double well potential , such as that in fig .",
    "readers may justifiably wonder if anything new remains to be said on so mature a subject , and we assure them that , by and large , there is nt .",
    "the physical phenomenon is certainly very well understood , as are the basic mathematical ideas behind the calculations .",
    "we find , nevertheless , that especially in the case of the ground state splitting , there is some confusion regarding the correct wkb answer for this splitting , which is often taken in a form that is less accurate than it needs to be .",
    "in particular , we note that the formula for the splitting in the masterly text book by landau and lifshitz @xcite leads to a prefactor which is incorrect for the ground state @xcite .",
    "a second problem is that the form in which this result is usually presented is poorly suited to calculation of the ground state splitting . in applying it to model problems such as the quartic double well potential , e.g. ,",
    "the unwary student is unnecessarlily led into asymptotic expansions of elliptic integrals , which must then be taken from standard tables of formulas .",
    "because of this confusion , there is also confusion regarding the equivalence of the wkb @xcite and the instanton @xcite methods for calculating tunnel splittings .    like many other problems in physics of a similar nature , the above discrepancies and their resolution are at the same time ",
    "well - known \" and not known at all !",
    "they are well - known to some experts .",
    "thus , the correct answers for the splitting are implicit throughout early wkb studies of the anharmonic oscillator @xcite , and can be ferreted out with some work .",
    "they are also clearly known to many field theorists @xcite , and to authors of more pedagogical articles @xcite . at the same time , the confusion persists , and continues to crop up from time to time .",
    "thus it seems worthwhile to address this issue here .",
    "it should also be stated at the outset that our article is of no interest if one only wants the splitting to  exponential accuracy \" , i.e. , if one only wants the gamow factor . in most physical applications , this is all that can sensibly be done , and the prefactor is best estimated as an  attempt frequency . \" from a mathematical point of view , however , the tunnel splitting is found as an asymptotic approximation in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "an  exponentially accurate \" answer for the splitting @xmath1 is one for which one only has an asymptotically correct result for @xmath2 .",
    "an asymptotically correct answer for @xmath1 itself requires worrying about the prefactor .",
    "more importantly , any formalism which did not give this prefactor , or which was incapable of giving it correctly even in principle , would be regarded as logically unsound .",
    "it is from this perspective that the prefactor is important .",
    "the confusion that is referred to above can be said to pertain solely to this prefactor , and readers who are not concerned with such arcana should stop reading here . on the other hand ,",
    "the wkb analysis presented here is easily incorporated into a graduate level discussion of tunnel splittings , with little additional effort beyond that of the standard treatment , and there is no reason not to do so . the problem may also serve as a  real - life \" physics example of some nontrivial asymptotic analysis .",
    "( to avoid misunderstanding , let us also state at the outset what we mean by wkb theory .",
    "we use the term in the broad sense used by bender and orszag @xcite , or by berry and mount @xcite , i.e. , as a body of mathematical techniques that yield global understanding and systematic asymptotic approximations to solutions of many linear differential equations ,    including schrdinger s equation , and shares ideas with other methods such as asymptotic matching and patching , boundary layer theory , etc .",
    "some readers may , however , define wkb to encomapss only the approximate exponential form ( [ psi01 ] ) ( and its oscillatory counterpart ) and connection formulas at linear turning points .",
    "a subset of these readers may recognize that our treatment in sec .",
    "ii is tantamount to the use of quadratic turning point @xcite connection formulas ( for which see berry and mount @xcite ) , and object that this goes beyond wkb .",
    "such a semantic restriction of the scope of the term ` wkb ' , should in our view , be avoided .",
    "since the method did not originate with wentzel , kramers , and brillouin , but had antecedents in the work of jeffreys , rayleigh , carlini , green , liouville , and perhaps others , there is no compelling historical reason for this restriction ( as opposed to say , the usages ` einstein model ' for lattice specific heat , or the ` kronig - penney model ' for electrons in a periodic potential ) , and it is surely more useful to present the subject to students as one which allows for systematic improvement , and is not a closed subject of study even today . )    it is with this motivation that we revisit the problem of calculating tunnel splittings in symmetric double well potentials .",
    "the article has three distinct aims .",
    "the first is to carefully calculate the prefactor multiplying the exponential of the turning - point - to - turning - point action integral in the standard wkb expression for the splitting @xmath1 .",
    "the correct formula is eq .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) below .",
    "our second aim is to present another formula [ see eqs .",
    "( [ simp][defa ] ) ] for the ground state splitting @xcite , that reduces everything to the evaluation of two integrals involving the potential @xmath3 , and does not require looking up any asymptotic expansions . the last aim is to show that the correct wkb and instanton @xcite methods do yield the same ground state splitting .",
    "we will do this by starting with coleman s instanton method expression for the splitting @xcite and showing that it reduces to our simple formula .",
    "we expect that our wkb based disucssion will be accessible to students who have seen some graduate level quantum mechanics , even though our starting formula for the splitting is rarely ever mentioned in the common text books .",
    "one book where it does appear is again that of landau and lifshitz @xcite , who give an exceptionally lucid and self - contained discussion .",
    "we will comment further on this formula when we come to it in sec .",
    "ii , and give a separate derivation of it in appendix a. the instanton formalism , and the path integral approach to quantum mechanics upon which it is in turn based , are less likely to be familiar , but clear and accessible discussions have been given in this journal by holstein @xcite , and by holstein and swift @xcite .",
    "the former discusses exactly the same problem as us , namely , the tunnel splitting , but for the special case of a quartic double well .",
    "we enthusiastically recommend coleman s somewhat longer but authoratitive article on instantons @xcite to readers who wish to learn more about this technique . a related paper by carlitz and nicole @xcite",
    "may also be read profitably .",
    "a plan of our paper and summary of our results is as follows .",
    "we consider a potential which is smooth , reflection symmetric about @xmath4=0 [ @xmath5 , and which has quadratic minima at @xmath6 . the correct wkb answer for the ground state splitting is @xcite = .",
    "[ wkbok ] here , @xmath7 is the frequency of small amplitude oscillations in the wells about @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the classical turning points given by the equation v(a ) = e_0 = + o ( ) , [ ctp ] and @xmath10 is the momentum p(x ) = [ 2 m ( v(x ) - e ) ] ^1/2 .",
    "[ mom ] note that @xmath11 is imaginary in the classically forbidden region @xmath12 , and that we have taken @xmath13 .",
    "the proof of eq .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) is given in sec .",
    "this entails matching the wkb wavefunction in the classically forbidden region to the exact harmonic oscillator wavefunction near the classical turning point , rather than use the connection formulas .",
    "this matching calculation may actually be found in a paper by furry  @xcite , but we include it because it is very short , and so as to have the complete argument in one place in a consistent notation .",
    "prefactor corrections similar to those in eq .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) accompany the excited states too , and are discussed in appendix b.    the expression ( [ wkbok ] ) is not easy to use because the integrand in the exponential is close to a singularity near the limits , which means that the next to leading dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath14 is not manifest .",
    "in fact , the true preexponential factor varies as @xmath15 , and this is not obvious from eq .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we shall , therefore , carefully extract the singular contributions to the action integral from the end points , and show that the splitting may be written for a general potential as = 2 ( ma^2 ) ^1/2 e^a e^-s_0/ , [ simp ] where @xmath16 ( note the limits of integration ) is the action integral s_0 = _ -a^a ( 2mv(x ) ) ^1/2 dx , [ s0 ] and a = _ 0^a dx . [ defa ] this expression does not have the complexities mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the prefactor is apparent , and the answer involves only integral functionals of @xmath3 .",
    "these formulas will be applied to two model problems in sec .",
    "v.    in sec .",
    "iv , we turn to the instanton approach @xcite . here , the splitting is expressed as = 2k ( s_0 2 ) ^1/2 ( -s_0/ ) , [ inst ] where @xmath16 is as in eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) , and k = ^1/2 [ vvdet ] is the ratio of fluctuation determinants . here , @xmath17 is the instanton , which obeys the ( euclidean ) classical equation of motion m d^2 x_cl ( ) d^2 - v(x_cl ) = 0 , [ eom ] with the boundary conditions @xmath18 , and the additional condition @xmath19 to fix the time translation degree of freedom .",
    "further , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the prime on the det in eq .",
    "( [ vvdet ] ) means that the zero eigenvalue of the operator argument is to be excluded from a product of all eigenvalues .",
    "a short and pedagogical discussion of the instanton method may be found in holstein @xcite .",
    "holstein does not explain how to calculate the quantity @xmath22 ( which is proportional to his quantity @xmath23 ) , so a few remarks that help elucidate its nature may not be out of place .",
    "note first , that each determinant appearing in eq .",
    "( [ vvdet ] ) is of a one - dimensional schrodinger - like operator , in which @xmath24 plays the role of position , and either @xmath25 or @xmath26 plays the role of the potential energy . next we note , that the determinant of such an operator may be defined as an infinite product of all its eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum of operators at hand may be rendered completely discrete by adding hard walls at @xmath27 , and letting @xmath28 at the end .",
    "this scheme has the advantage that it allows us to put the eigenvalues of both operators in one - to - one correspondence .",
    "this in turn enables us to argue that one eigenvalue is missing in the denominator , and since the eigenvalues have the dimensions of @xmath29 or @xmath25 , we see that @xmath22 has the dimensions of frequency . for a smooth potential @xmath3 ,",
    "the curvature @xmath26 is never very different from @xmath25 in the interval @xmath30 , so there is only one frequency scale in the problem .",
    "it follows that @xmath22 is of order @xmath7 .    to the author s knowledge ,",
    "the equivalence of eqs .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) and ( [ inst ] ) has only been shown for particular examples , such as the quartic double well potential .",
    "a general demonstration is lacking , although it is implicit in the fact that both methods start from the same point and are correctly executed .",
    "a direct demonstration is therefore of some value .",
    "secondly , eq .  ( [ inst ] ) is complicated just as eq .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) was .",
    "indeed , the ratio of determinants seems more intimidating and harder to calculate than the integral in eq .",
    "( [ wkbok ] ) .",
    "original calculation @xcite for @xmath22 is quite involved , and while it has been greatly simplified by coleman @xcite , it still requires solving the auxilliary problem of finding the instanton @xmath17 .    to relate the instanton and wkb answers ,",
    "ws therefore show in sec .",
    "iv , that coleman s result for @xmath22 may be expressed in terms of the integral @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ defa ] ) .",
    "thus , although we do not provide a complete derivation of the instanton result for @xmath1 , once coleman s formulas are accepted , our analysis shows the equivalence of the two approaches .",
    "our starting point is the formula @xcite = 2 ^ 2 m _ 0(0 ) _0(0 ) , [ herr ] where @xmath32 is an approximate solution to schrdinger s equation with energy @xmath33 , which is localized in the right hand well , and decays away from that well , in the _ entire _ central , classically forbidden region .",
    "further , it is normalized to yield unit total probability in the right hand well .",
    "note that it is not necessary to examine or specify the behaviour of @xmath32 near @xmath34 .",
    "lastly , @xmath35 .",
    "we digress briefly at this point to comment on the formula ( [ herr ] ) , which does not seem to be widely known .",
    "it is sometimes named after conyers herring , who derived it ( in a slightly more general form , in fact ) in the course of evaluating the _ g_-_u _ splitting of the two lowest electronic states of the h@xmath36 molecular ion @xcite .",
    "the actual derivation is simple , and very similar to the usual half - page of analysis used to argue that the the hamiltonian operator in the position representation is hermitean and has real eigenvalues , and so we refer readers to landau and lifshitz @xcite for the details .",
    "instead , we present an alternative derivation in appendix a.    resuming our argument , we note that the wkb approximation for @xmath32 in the region @xmath37 is _ 0(x ) = c_0 _ 0^x | p(x)| dx , [ psi01 ] where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a constant to be found by matching on to the solution in the well . to the accuracy of this solution , @xmath40 , so that = 2c_0 ^ 2 . [ csq ]",
    "to find @xmath39 , we first note that near @xmath41 , @xmath32 is very accurately given by the ground state harmonic oscillator wave function _ 0(x ) = ( m ) ^1/4 .",
    "[ psi02 ] in fact , this form holds well into the forbidden region , and so can be directly matched to eq .",

    "( [ wkbok ] ) .",
    "landau and lifshitz obtain @xmath39 by using connection formulas near a linear turning point , and the standard wkb result for the normalization of a bound state .",
    "for the ground state , this procedure is not accurate enough , and we must proceed as above .",
    "( some readers may recognize in our procedure , the use of quadratic turning point formulas @xcite . )",
    "once this is realized , similar prefactor corrections are expected for the low lying excited states .",
    "these corrections are obtained in appendix b.",
    "in this section we will show that the wkb expression ( [ wkbok ] ) leads to the simpler result ( [ simp][defa ] ) .",

    "use of this formula greatly simplifies the labour required to solve all the standard double - well problems : the double square well with infinite side walls @xcite , the double delta function @xcite , and the double harmonic oscillator with a kink @xcite . for smooth potentials , where wkb is indicated",
    ", it is far superior to the approach where one uses connection formulas at all four turning points @xcite . further , the formula brings out the physical point that a tunnel _ splitting _ is intimately related to a tunneling _ amplitude _ , since it relates the amplitude to make a transition between wells per unit time , @xmath132 , to the probability current .",
    "the reader will also have noticed that the above argument can not be carried out for an asymmetric potential , and indeed the very concept of tunnel splitting is then very delicate .",
    "a tunneling amplitude can of course still be defined , but since this amplitude is exponentially small in general ( on account of the gamow factor ) , mixing between left and right well states will be negligible unless the bottoms of the two wells are tuned to the same exponential sensitivity .",
    "the mathematical formulation of these points leads to extremely unpleasant transcendental equations , and the situation is not significantly improved in the case of symmetric potentials if one approaches the problem solely in terms of enforcing continuity of the wave function and its derivative .",
    "it is probably because of this fact that most introductory or intermediate quantum mechanics texts do not consider double - well tunnel splittings when they discuss the wkb method .",
    "use of herring s formula ( with or without wkb ) would make the problem much more tractable , and its widespread adoption is thus greatly to be desired .",

    "the essential part is to find @xmath148 in the classically forbidden region and match it onto the @xmath133th harmonic oscillator state in the vicinity of the well @xmath149 .",

    "the key requirement is that the correction terms be small compared to the unperturbed wavefunction near the turning point @xmath155 .",
    "the dominant corrections are those that entail the hermite polynomials of order @xmath156 through @xmath157 .",

    "for example , many workers in the field of macroscopic quantum tunneling , including the author , have often been puzzled and frustrated that the final formula in this book does not yield the same ground state splitting as the instanton approach for the quartic double well .",
