    "as intermediate - mass stars ascend the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , the combination of a convective mantle with the occurrence of thermal pulses in the interior of the star causes nuclear burning products to be transported to the photosphere of the star ( @xmath4 dredge - up ) .",
    "it may enhance the carbon over oxygen ratio in the photosphere . when this ratio exceeds unity , a carbon star is born .",
    "two decades ago it was realised that in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , where reliable luminosities for individual stars could be obtained , no carbon stars were known more luminous than @xmath5 mag , whereas the agb extends up to @xmath6 mag ( e.g.  iben 1981 ) .",
    "this was surprising , as the lower metallicity in the lmc was thought to increase the efficiency of @xmath4 dredge - up .",
    "recent studies confirm the lack of optically bright carbon stars in the lmc ( costa & frogel 1996 ) .",
    "three solutions were suggested : ( 1 ) high mass - loss rates yield a cut - off to the agb evolution at @xmath7 mag , ( 2 ) nuclear burning at the bottom of the convective mantle of massive agb stars ( hot bottom burning , or hbb ) prevents the dredge - up of carbon ( iben & renzini 1983 ; wood et al .  1983 ) , or ( 3 )",
    "luminous carbon stars have become obscured by their dusty circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "the first solution is ruled out by the detection in the lmc of li - rich stars with luminosities between @xmath8 and @xmath9 mag ( smith et al .",
    "1995 ) and agb star luminosities in clusters in the lmc ( aaronson & mould 1985 ; westerlund et al .",
    "hbb has been commonly accepted as the solution ( boothroyd et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that massive carbon stars are dust - enshrouded , by searching for obscured agb counterparts of iras point sources in the lmc and smc , ( loup et al .",
    "1997 ; zijlstra et al .  1996",
    "; van loon et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a : papers i to iv ) .",
    "chemical types could only be identified for a few stars .",
    "hence the luminosity distributions of obscured oxygen - rich and carbon stars in the lmc are not well defined .",
    "one very luminous carbon star candidate was found in the lmc , the obscured agb star iras04496@xmath106958 ( paper iv ) .",
    "remarkably , trams et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) recently presented iso spectra showing that the cse of this object also contains an oxygen - rich dust component .    in this paper , we present ground - based l - band ( 3 @xmath0 m ) spectra of obscured agb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we had the opportunity to do these observations as a result of an exchange of observing time between the european southern observatory ( eso ) and the cerro tololo inter - american observatories ( ctio ) .",
    "absorption between 3.0 and 3.3 @xmath0 m is due to hcn and c@xmath1h@xmath1 molecules in the extended atmospheres of carbon stars , whilst oxygen - rich , m - type , stars display a featureless continuum at this wavelength ( merrill & stein , 1976a , b , c ; noguchi et al .",
    "1977 ; ridgway et al .  1978 ) .",
    "we show the spectrum of iras04496@xmath106958 , confirming its carbon star nature .",
    "we also use the 3 @xmath0 m spectra of other luminous obscured agb stars in the lmc and smc to classify them as carbon or m star .",
    "these are the first 3 @xmath0 m spectra of extra - galactic stars to be presented in the literature .",
    ".observing log of 3 @xmath0 m spectroscopy of obscured agb stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we list iras and li ( schwering & israel 1990 ) designations , and alternative names .",
    "iras00393@xmath107326 is a faint source catalogue entry , iras05203@xmath106638 is from reid ( 1991 ) .",
    "julian dates are @xmath11 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have determined the equivalent width @xmath12 of the 3 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "the continuum can be estimated near 2.9 and 3.3 @xmath0 m , which is also the major source of uncertainty .",
    "errors ( 2-@xmath13 ) were estimated by measuring @xmath12 for the highest and lowest continuum levels that are still compatible with the data .",
    "the results are listed in table 2 , together with the @xmath3 colours .",
    "the smc photometry is from groenewegen & blommaert ( 1998 ) .",
    "we plot the @xmath14 versus the @xmath3 colours ( fig .",
    "the scatter of the m - type stars around @xmath15 @xmath0 m gives a good impression of the accuracy of the estimates of @xmath14 .",
    "all carbon stars are well separated from the oxygen - rich m - type stars . despite the larger than typical error on @xmath14 for iras05128@xmath106455 ,",
    "it is evident that it is a carbon star",
    ". we also plot equivalent widths that we measured for the galactic carbon stars from groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    in the lmc ,",
    "the @xmath3 colours of the carbon stars are redder than those of the m - type stars .",
    "as we could only take spectra of stars that were sufficiently bright in the l - band , bolometrically faint stars only entered our sample if they had red @xmath3 colours .",
    "the carbon stars in our sample are , on average , somewhat less luminous than the m stars . as the inner radius of the cse scales with luminosity , at a given mass - loss rate , the cses of the carbon stars are optically thicker than the cses of the m stars .",
    "the three bluest carbon stars show the strongest absorption feature . the absorption is formed predominantly within the dust - free inner region of the cse .",
    "the redder carbon stars have stronger dust continuum emission , decreasing the contrast between the absorption feature and the continuum ( ridgway et al.1983 ) .",
    "the dust continuum emission becomes important for sources with dust optical depths corresponding to @xmath16 mag .",
    "this trend is prominent in our data of magellanic cloud stars , and matches well with the milky way stars of groenewegen et al .",
    "1994 ( see also noguchi et al .  1981 , 1991 ) .",
    "the 3 @xmath0 m absorption in the smc source iras00554@xmath107351 is relatively weak .",
    "note that the galactic carbon star iras21377@xmath175042 has @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 @xmath0 m , which would make it indistinguishable from m - type stars with the typical signal - to - noise in our data .",
    "however , it has very blue ir colours and no molecular emission could be detected at mm wavelengths ( groenewegen et al .",
    "1994 ) , which makes it a highly peculiar object .",
    "it is unlikely to encounter such a star in our sample of stars .      in table 2",
    "we also list the bolometric magnitudes .",
    "we determined bolometric magnitudes for the smc stars in the same way as for the lmc stars ( papers ii , iii & iv ) by spline fitting to the spectro - photometric energy distribution ( see whitelock et al .",
    "the accuracy of this method is @xmath20 mag .",
    "the near - ir photometry are single - epoch data , and time - averaged luminosities may differ from the values presented here .",
    "bolometric amplitudes of galactic carbon stars are @xmath21 mag ( le bertre 1992 ) and probably similar to those of galactic oh / ir stars ( le bertre 1993 ) , hence we expect single - epoch luminosities to be within 0.3 mag of the time - averaged luminosity .",
    "we adopt distance moduli of 18.7 and 19.1 mag for the lmc and smc ( feast 1998 ) .",
    "these constitute a rather long distance scale , with the average estimate for the distance moduli for the lmc and smc being 18.55 and 18.97 mag , respectively ( walker 1998 ) .    in fig .  4 we plot a histogram of the luminosities of the carbon stars and m stars in our sample .",
    "we note that due to the small number of stars , and a possible bias towards carbon stars when we selected the stars , one should not over - interpret these histograms as the luminosity functions of obscured m - type and carbon stars in the mcs .",
    "however , there is no indication for a deficit in carbon stars brighter than @xmath8 mag : carbon stars do exist up to the highest agb luminosities : @xmath6 mag . iras04498@xmath106842 and",
    "iras05298@xmath106957 may be luminosity enhanced due to the effects of hbb , or they may actually be red supergiants .",
    "luminous carbon stars may be formed after the agb star has become obscured by its dusty cse . when mass loss has reduced the stellar mantle below a critical mass , hbb switches off ( boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ) .",
    "if such a star experiences another thermal pulse before leaving the agb , it may become a carbon star , after all ( frost et al .",
    "1998 ; marigo et al .",
    "this scenario is consistent with our spectroscopic confirmation of luminous carbon star candidates that are dust - enshrouded as a result of their agb mass loss .",
    "the most luminous of these , iras04496@xmath106958 , has an estimated @xmath22 mag .",
    "however , we note that this object is peculiar in that it has a ( minor ) oxygen - rich dust component in its cse ( trams et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .    as the most luminous carbon star in the lmc is not experiencing hbb",
    ", its luminosity must not exceed the classical limit to the agb luminosity : @xmath23 mag ( wood et al .",
    "1983 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ) .",
    "this sets an upper limit to the distance modulus of the lmc of 18.8 mag .",
    "differences in metallicity may be expected to affect the molecular and dust abundances in the cses . yet",
    "carbon stars in the lmc and the milky way appear to follow the same sequence of @xmath14 versus @xmath3 .",
    "we here investigate whether this can be understood .    the observed @xmath24 is to a good approximation a dilution factor @xmath25 smaller than the @xmath26 in the purely photospheric spectrum : @xmath27 where the diluted flux @xmath28 is given by : @xmath29 with the photospheric flux @xmath30 , dust emission source function @xmath31 , and optical depth @xmath32 .",
    "we see that @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath32 ( times the ratio of @xmath34 ) .",
    "the difference between the observed @xmath3 and the photospheric @xmath35 colour is also proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "hence , for a given @xmath26 , when the metallicity decreases , so does the optical depth of the cse .",
    "the @xmath3 colour becomes bluer , and the carbon star shifts along  not away from  the @xmath14 versus @xmath3 sequence .",
    "the fact that carbon stars in the lmc and the milky way appear to follow the same sequence of @xmath24 versus @xmath3 therefore implies that @xmath26 is independent of metallicity .",
    "as the 3 @xmath0 m absorption is caused by hcn and c@xmath1h@xmath1 molecules , we now investigate how their abundances are expected to depend on metallicity .    as c@xmath1h@xmath1 associates at lower temperatures and gas pressures than hcn ( ridgway et al .",
    "1978 ) , free carbon is expected to be preferentially locked into hcn .",
    "we assume that the number of carbon atoms that are left after all oxygen is consumed in the formation of co molecules , the free carbon abundance @xmath36(c@xmath10o ) , will combine with the available nitrogen atoms @xmath36(n ) to form hcn molecules .",
    "the free carbon abundance is determined by the initial free carbon abundance , @xmath37(c@xmath10o ) , and the production and dredge - up of carbon during the thermal - pulsing agb , @xmath38(c ) .",
    "likewise , the nitrogen abundance is determined by the initial nitrogen abundance , @xmath37(n ) , and the production and dredge - up of nitrogen , @xmath38(n ) .",
    "the latter takes place already before the thermal - pulsing agb , but is especially important when hbb occurs .",
    "the initial abundance is proportional to the metallicity @xmath39 .",
    "both the free carbon and the nitrogen abundance can be written in identical form : @xmath40 it is not well known what is the metallicity dependence of @xmath38 . with @xmath41 , the hcn abundance ratio between a carbon star in the lmc and a corresponding carbon star in the milky way ( mw ) can be written as @xmath42 where the enrichment term @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    initially there is more oxygen than carbon , and @xmath45(c@xmath10o ) is negative . to make a carbon star , @xmath38(c ) must exceed .",
    "with the same value for @xmath43(c)@xmath46 in the lmc and the milky way , eq .",
    "4 implies that more hcn would be produced in the lmc than in the milky way if the free carbon abundance limits the hcn abundance , much in the same way that it is easier to make carbon stars at lower metallicity because there is less oxygen to bind into co. if , however , the nitrogen abundance limits the hcn abundance , then , as @xmath45(n ) and thus @xmath43(n ) are positive , eq .  4 implies that less hcn will be produced in the lmc than in the milky way unless the nitrogen enrichment term @xmath43 is larger at lower metallicity .",
    "the question now is which species is more abundant in magellanic carbon stars : nitrogen or free carbon ?",
    "the photospheric abundance of a carbon star near the end of its agb life resembles that of the pn that will be ejected . of the @xmath47 pne in the lmc@xmath17smc",
    "for which leisy & dennefeld ( 1996 ) measured abundances , @xmath48 have @xmath36(c@xmath10o)@xmath49 , i.e.  their progenitors left the agb as carbon stars .",
    "all of these have @xmath36(c@xmath10o)@xmath50(n ) , the only exception being smp47 in the lmc of type i ( nitrogen - enhanced ) .",
    "this would suggest that in the mcs , @xmath36(hcn ) in carbon stars is limited by @xmath36(n ) , not by @xmath36(c@xmath10o ) .",
    "however , the pne in the mcs are all less luminous than about 10,000 l@xmath51 , corresponding to the luminosity of the faintest carbon star in our sample .",
    "the only more luminous pn in the lmc is smp83 , which is oxygen - rich ( dopita et al .",
    "1993 ) . in luminous agb stars with massive cores",
    ", hbb enhances the nitrogen abundance .",
    "this starts to be effective around @xmath8 mag , where the optical luminosity function of carbon stars in the mcs truncates .",
    "however , when mass loss continues , hbb diminishes .",
    "stellar evolution codes show the n / o to decrease again , whilst the c / o increases ( marigo et al .",
    "if an agb star becomes a carbon star only after having experienced hbb , nitrogen may not be as over - abundant as observed for instance in pne of type i  that are usually oxygen - rich .",
    "so we can not be sure whether our sample of magellanic carbon stars also have @xmath36(c@xmath10o)@xmath50(n ) .",
    "anyway , any surplus of carbon ends up in c@xmath1h@xmath1 .",
    "thus , all carbon contributes to the 3 @xmath0 m absorption , either through hcn or c@xmath1h@xmath1 .",
    "if this is correct , then the strength of the 3 @xmath0 m absorption is determined by the free carbon abundance , no matter what the nitrogen abundance is .",
    "hence , in analogy to eq .",
    "4 we expect the 3 @xmath0 m absorption to be stronger in the lmc than in the milky way , in disagreement with our observations . if the carbon enrichment is much larger than the initial carbon abundance ( @xmath43(c)@xmath52 ) the differences in 3 @xmath0 m absorption strength may be too small to appreciate in our data .",
    "alternatively , the carbon enrichment may be less at lower metallicity .",
    "another explanation may lie in the fact that stellar photospheres are warmer at lower metallicity .",
    "the rotational bands of hcn and c@xmath1h@xmath1 are excited at temperatures between @xmath53 and 1500 k ( ridgway et al.1983 ) , which occurs more distant to a warmer stellar photosphere .",
    "the 3 @xmath0 m band strength may be weakened by this effect , canceling the expected increase in strength due to the more abundant free carbon at lower metallicity .",
