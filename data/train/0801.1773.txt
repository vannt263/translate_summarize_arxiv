    "the hubbard model @xcite for strongly correlated electrons has been used for a wide variety of phenomena , ranging from high temperature superconductivity @xcite to the metal insulator transition or antiferromagnetism .",
    "solving this model is a major theoretical challenge .",
    "this is due to the complexity of the effective electron interaction , typically characterized by the competition of different channels , like the antiferromagnetic or @xmath1-wave cooper - pair exchange channels @xcite .",
    "so far , the development of @xmath1-wave superconductivity is still a controversial issue .",
    "although several many - body techniques predict the emergence of a @xmath1-wave instability as leading instability in certain parameter ranges , see e. g. @xcite , numerical studies have difficulties to detect superconductivity @xcite , as a consequence of both finite size and temperature limitations .",
    "the @xmath1-wave - pairing interactions are absent in the microscopic hubbard model . as a plausible mechanism leading to @xmath1-wave pairing the exchange of effective",
    "antiferromagnetic bosonic degrees of freedom has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this idea was also suggested by @xcite on the basis of a phenomenological spin - spin susceptibility .",
    "the generation of the interaction in the @xmath1-wave channel has been investigated extensively by the functional renormalization group study of a momentum dependent four electron vertex @xcite .",
    "our investigation employs non - perturbative flow equations , based on exact renormalization group equations for the average action or flowing action @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is complementary to studies of the electron vertex by focussing explicitely on the role of the antiferromagnetic bosons , using the technique of partial bosonization during the flow @xcite .",
    "we investigate the two - dimensional hubbard model with nearest and next to nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "the aim of this note is the derivation of an effective coarse grained model , valid at intermediate length scales @xmath2 larger than the lattice distance @xmath3 , but smaller than the scale of macroscopic physics .",
    "our effective model will be based on a description of the electron interactions by the exchange of collective bosons . near half - filling a model with exchange of antiferromagnetic boson has been used @xcite for a quantitative computation of effective antiferromagnetic order below the effective critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it is advocated that in two dimensions the size of the ordered domains increases exponentially as the temperature decreases towards zero . for",
    "@xmath5 this size exceeds the size of a typical experimental probe .",
    "for all practical purposes the physics is then the same as for an ordered system .",
    "this includes the existence of long range fluctations associated to goldstone bosons . for @xmath6 short range antiferromagnetic order is found , with a typical domain size smaller than the experimental probe .",
    "here @xmath7 denotes the pseudo - critical temperature below which short range antiferromagnetic order sets in . in this paper",
    "we extend this approach by including the exchange of collective bosons consisting of cooper - pairs in the @xmath1-wave channel .",
    "they are assumed to be a crucial ingredient for the understanding of the hubbard model away from half filling .",
    "their condensate would lead to superconductivity .",
    "we have investigated earlier the phase transition to superconductivity in an effective @xmath1-wave exchange model @xcite .",
    "the phase transition is found to be of the kosterlitz - thouless type @xcite , characterized by ( modified ) essential scaling above @xmath4 , a jump of the superfluid density at @xmath4 , and a gapless excitation with temperature dependent anomalous dimension below @xmath4 .",
    "the present note constitutes a step for establishing such an effective model as a coarse grained version of the microscopic hubbard model .",
    "this mapping is not yet complete , since we concentrate here only on the generation of the effective electron interaction in the @xmath1-wave channel and its bosonization , while a more detailed investigation of the propagators and interactions of the @xmath1-wave bosons is postponed to a subsequent publication .",
    "the partially bosonized model opens the door for a straightforward computation of the flow below the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath7 , where local order sets in and higher order boson interactions ( e.g. corresponding to eight - fermion interactions ) play an important role .",
    "the low temperature region is notoriously difficult for a purely fermionic description since the four fermion interaction diverges as the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath7 is approached from above .",
    "also the important effect of higher fermionic operators can be taken into account most conveniently in a partially bosonized formulation @xcite . in the partially bosonized description",
    "the divergence of the four fermion interaction is due to a boson `` mass term '' or `` gap '' changing from positive to negative values during the flow .",
    "a negative mass term indicates local order , since at a given coarse graining scale @xmath8 the effective potential has a minimum for a nonzero value of the boson field .",
    "if this order persists for @xmath8 reaching a macroscopic scale , the model exhibits effectively spontaneous symmetry breaking , associated in our model to antiferromagnetism or @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "on the other hand , the partially bosonized formulation introduces some bias into the renormalization group procedure by focussing on one or several boson exchange channels .",
    "this can be circumvented in the purely fermionic renormalization group flow . however",
    ", this bias can be systematically reduced by the introduction of further bosonic fields , which yield additional resolution for the description of the interaction between the electrons .",
    "the present approach constitutes a first step into this direction and is thus complementary to references @xcite .",
    "we use a functional integral framework and investigate the effective average action @xmath9 @xcite , which includes all quantum and thermal fluctuations with momenta @xmath10 .",
    "this is realized by introducing an infrared cutoff @xmath11 which suppresses the fluctuations with @xmath12 .",
    "this cutoff will be removed at the end for @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    "one recovers the usual effective action ",
    "the generating functional for the one particle irreducible green functions . for @xmath15 , or @xmath16 , with @xmath17 a suitable ultraviolet scale , the fluctuation effects are negligible and @xmath18 becomes the microscopic or classical action @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the scale dependent average action @xmath9 interpolates between the microscopic action @xmath20 and the full quantum effective action @xmath21 , @xmath22    the @xmath8-dependent flow of the average action obeys an exact renormalization group equation @xcite , @xmath23=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{str}\\{[\\gamma^{(2)}_k[\\chi]+r_k]^{-1}\\partial_kr_k\\ } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the `` supertrace '' @xmath24 runs over field type , momentum and internal indices , and has an additional minus sign for fermionic entries .",
    "the functional differential equation ( [ eq : flowequation ] ) involves the full inverse propagator @xmath25 $ ] ( second functional derivative of @xmath9 ) , regulated by @xmath11 .",
    "approximations to the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flowequation ] ) proceed by a truncation on the rhs with a suitable ansatz for the form of @xmath9 .    on the microscopic level",
    ", the hubbard model is defined as a purely fermionic model for electrons on a lattice .",
    "however , it is well known that also bosonic degrees of freedom , e.g. cooper - pairs , play an important role on larger length scales .",
    "hence , the question arises how the optimal description of the relevant degrees of freedom on all scales can be achieved within a functional renormalization group study . on the one hand , we want to accommodate the purely fermionic model at high momentum scales .",
    "on the other hand , we want to study phase transitions and critical behavior for the macroscopic physics . in the vicinity of the critical temperature",
    "the long range fluctuations are dominated by bosonic composite operators . in order to exploit directly the importance of the collective bosonic degrees of freedom ,",
    "we employ partial bosonization as motivated by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking can then be described simply by nonzero expectation values of suitable bosonic fields . in a purely fermionic description",
    "the four fermion coupling often diverges for temperatures below a pseudo - critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this indicates the onset of local order for @xmath26 . in the partially bosonized version",
    "this simply translates to a vanishing `` mass parameter '' or gap for the bosons , and does not constitute an obstacle for investigations at @xmath26 .",
    "antiferromagnetic order for the two - dimensional hubbard model at half filling has been successfully described in this framework @xcite .",

    "we will see that a vanishing of @xmath49 corresponds to a diverging effective four fermion coupling , while negative @xmath49 leads to a minimum of @xmath50 at @xmath51 , and therefore indicates spontaneous symmetry breaking . in the renormalization group treatment , @xmath49 and @xmath52 become @xmath8-dependent running couplings . a situation with @xmath53 for @xmath54",
