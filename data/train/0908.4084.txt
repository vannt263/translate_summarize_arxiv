    "starburst galaxies are hosts of intense star formation activity with star formation rates ( sfr ) more than a factor of 3 compared to the milky way ( sfr@xmath310m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "the stellar population of the starbursts , especially the number of massive stars and the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) , directly affect the hardness of the ionization field in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "therefore , ratios of emission lines of different excitation levels are powerful tools to study the properties of the ionization field and to infer the stellar population of the starbursts .",
    "infrared emission - line ratios are of particular interest and have been explored extensively with the infrared space observatory ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and far - ir .",
    "the advent of the spitzer space telescope with its improved sensitivity opens new avenues in this direction , enabling detailed studies of large samples of quiescent and star forming galaxies @xcite , as well as more complex dust enshrouded infrared luminous sources which often host an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) @xcite .    estimating the hardness of the ionization field plays a key role in determining the dominant power source at the centers of galaxies .",
    "nuclear starbursts and accreting super - massive black holes ( smbh ) are often intertwined and coexist , as best demonstrated in the case of ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs)(see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the radiation of an agn , produced from the accretion of gas and stars onto the smbh , has a much harder spectrum compared to the one produced by the massive young stellar populations .",
    "therefore , the hardness of the radiation field has been a key parameter addressed by previous diagnostic methods to determine the energy source in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the study of the ionization field of galaxies with massive starbursts , the case of low - metallicity blue compact dwarfs ( bcds )",
    "is particularly interesting .",
    "bcds are galaxies characterized by their blue optical colors ( m@xmath6@xmath7 - 18mag ) , small linear sizes ( @xmath71kpc ) and low luminosities @xcite .",
    "even though bcds are defined based on their morphological properties , they have been ubiquitously found to have low oxygen abundances as measured from the ionized gas in hii regions .",
    "it is well established that the hardness of the stellar radiation increases with decreasing metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the ionization field of bcds is generally much harder compared to a typical starburst .",
    "it is also known that the mass of a super massive black hole ( smbh ) is correlated with the mass of the bulge of the host galaxy @xcite while only a fraction of the most massive smbh are actively emitting radiation as a result of mass accretion @xcite .",
    "bcds in general are not massive enough to host such an active smbh , with possibly only a few exceptions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the excitation mechanism for the hard radiation field in bcds is likely significantly different from the one responsible for the radiation field produced by an agn .",
    "furthermore , unlike starburst galaxies which are often obscured by dust , an analysis of a large sample of bcds suggests that in bcds nearly always the young massive stars which ionize the interstellar medium are easily detected and their dust extinction measured from the optical balmer lines is typically fairly low @xcite .",
    "there might be exceptions indicated from the mid - ir observations , with sbs0335 - 052e as the most extreme case .",
    "however , this is rather a unique galaxy and deviates from the usual trends seen in bcds for different reasons as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "understanding the differences in the excitation mechanism between bcds and agns can provide insightful clues to decipher the power source in a starburst galaxy also hosting an agn .",
    "identifying those differences from the mid - ir spectral features is one of the main motivations behind the present work .",
    "bcds are often much fainter than typical starburst galaxies in the infrared .",
    "up until the launch of the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope @xcite , studies of starburst galaxies in the ir have included only a handful of bcds @xcite . the superb sensitivity of the _ spitzer _  allows us to observe a large sample of bcds ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we provide the ionized gas diagnostic analysis of the low metallicity bcds accessible to the high - resolution modules of the infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we contrast the bcd sample with typical starbursts and agns , to probe the excitation mechanism in these types of objects and understand where the difference comes from .    in  2 , we introduce the sample and the data reduction method . in  3 , we study the high - ionization emission lines , and propose a new diagnostic diagram to determine the energy source in a galaxy . in  4 , we focus on other infrared emission lines and compare various excitation diagnostic diagrams of starbursts and bcds .",
    "our findings are summarized in  5 .",
    "we have compiled a sample of 12 bcds and observed them in starring mode with the high - resolution modules ( short - high , sh : 4.7@xmath8@xmath911.3@xmath8 and long - high ,",
    "lh : 11.1@xmath8@xmath922.3@xmath8 ) of the irs as part of the instrument team s guaranteed time observation ( gto ) programs .",
    "the galaxies were drawn from the sample of @xcite .",
    "we exclude tol1214 - 277 as it is too faint and its high - resolution spectrum has low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we also exclude cg0752 , cg0563 , and cg0598 as they do not show typical bcd signatures .",
    "the characteristics of individual objects in the sample and analysis based on their _ spitzer _  low - resolution spectra are presented in @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution module slits were centered on the nucleus of each galaxy , as was the case of the low - resolution observations @xcite .",
    "the data were processed by the _ spitzer",
    "_  science center ( ssc ) data reduction pipeline version 13.2 .",
    "individual pointings to each nod position of the slit were co - added .",
    "the median of the combined images were extracted using the full slit extraction method of the _ irs _ data analysis package smart @xcite . then the extracted spectra were flux calibrated by multiplying them with a relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) , which was created from the _ irs _ standard star , @xmath10 dra , for which accurate templates were available @xcite .",
    "note that emission from the sky background has not been subtracted from our spectra due to the lack of dedicated sky observations , thus discontinuity exists in some source spectra between sh and lh , however , this will not affect the results of our analysis since our conclusions are based on ratios of emission lines observed in the same module .    in the appendix",
    ", we include close up plots of strong and weak emission lines visible in the irs high - resolution spectra of bcds . in order to measure the line strengths ,",
    "a gaussian profile is fitted to the lines above a local continuum fitted by an one - order polynomial .",
    "the [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m and [ feii]25.99@xmath0 m are close to each other and they are fit together using a two - gaussian profile with fixed rest - frame wavelengths . the measured line strengths for the bcd sample are listed in table  [ tabline ] .",
    "the errors are estimated based on the error propagation of the gaussian fit assuming the error of the flux as the root mean square ( @xmath11 ) of the continuum fit .",
    "note that this does not take into account all the systematic uncertainties , especially the flux calibration .",
    "we estimate these to be 5% and choose it as our minimum uncertainty .",
    "the upper - limits are obtained by measuring the flux of a gaussian with a height three times the local @xmath11 , and with a fwhm equal to the instrumental resolution .",
    "no extinction correction has been performed in our analysis .",
    "the corrections are typically minor for mid - ir fine - structure line ratios , except for ratios involving lines found close to the silicate features , such as the [ siv]10.51@xmath0 m line . in the analysis of diagrams involving the [ siv ] line ( see figure  [ sratio_neratio ] ) , we provide arrows indicating the effects of an a@xmath12=30 mag of extinction , assuming a uniform dust screen and a @xcite extinction curve ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in order to study the ionization field of starbursts over a broad range of physical properties , we also examine a sample of 24 local starbursts observed in staring mode with the irs high - resolution modules .",
    "the details of the sample , their high - resolution spectra and line measurements are described in @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that even though we broadly use the term `` starburst '' when referring to them , some may also have a weak agn component .",
    "in addition , we created a comparison sample of typical agns to investigate how the difference in the excitation mechanism of the gas , namely the radiation produced by an accretion disk versus massive young star formation , is reflected in the mid - ir emission lines .",
    "it is not our intention to have an agn sample that is complete , but rather one that is representative of typical agns .",
    "hence , we choose bona - fide agns , with no ambiguity in their classification , where the nuclear emission is known to dominate the integrated spectra of their host galaxies .",
    "we select from the type 1 sources ( quasars and seyfert 1s ) used in @xcite for which irs high - resolution observations are available .",
    "we also examine the strength of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission in their mid - ir spectra and exclude sources with strong pah features , since this would suggest a significant contribution from star forming regions in the disk of the host galaxy . among those sources with weak pah emission , we choose 10 agns that show strong mid - ir emission lines , in order to obtain the best s / n possible in our measurements .",
    "the agn irs spectra were extracted and the emission lines measured in the same way as the bcds ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , whenever applicable , we also compare the properties of emission lines in bcds with those in low - redshift ulirgs as well as hii regions found in our galaxy , and in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc / smc ) . the sample and line measurements of the low - redshift ulirgs are taken from @xcite , and the hii region data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the irs high - resolution spectra of bcds are rich in fine - structure emission lines .",
    "all bcds display strong [ neiii]15.56@xmath0 m , [ siii]18.71@xmath0 m , and [ siv]10.51@xmath0 m emission .",
    "the [ neii]12.81@xmath0 m line is well detected in about half of the bcd sample , but it is not seen in sbs0335 - 052e , tol65 , and viizw403 . in the comparison samples of starbursts and agns , all these lines are strong and we discuss their relative flux ratios in  4 .",
    "the presence of high - ionization emission lines is of great interest , since their excitation often requires extreme conditions .",
    "one particular case is the [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m line which has an ionization potential ( ip ) of 54ev , just above the heii edge , and therefore it can not be readily generated in the hii regions surrounding main - sequence stars .",
    "however , the [ oiv ] line had already been detected in several starburst galaxies with iso ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a possible explanation for this was that the [ oiv ] emission is due to a dust enshrouded agn as the hard radiation field produced by the agn can easily provide the energy needed to ionize o@xmath13 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that at least in some starburst systems ( such as the outer regions of m82 ) , the [ oiv ] can not be attributed to a weak agn .",
    "instead it must be due to either very hot stars , such as the wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( see also * ? ? ? * ) or to the ionizing shocks associated with the starburst activity .    with the superb sensitivity of the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope , we now find that the [ oiv ] line is fairly common in our bcd sample as well as the comparison sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "we detected [ oiv ] emission in 8 of the 12 bcds , and in 21 of the 24 starbursts ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is very interesting since , as we will discuss in the following sessions , line ratios involving [ oiv ] provide a good diagnostic tool for identifying the presence of an agn ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "25.89@xmath0m/[siii]33.48@xmath0 m as a function of [ neiii]15.56@xmath0m/[neii]12.81@xmath0 m , for bcds ( diamonds ) , starbursts ( squares ) , agns ( crosses ) , and ulirgs ( plus signs ) .",
    "a circle around a symbol indicates that [ nev]14.32@xmath0 m emission has been detected , while a filled symbol implies that this galaxy also has been classified as a wolf - rayet ( wr ) in the optical ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "the error bars of the line ratios in this and all subsequent plots are similar to the symbol size .",
    "the galaxies appear to be localized on two branches .",
    "one branch consists mainly of agns , or starbursts / ulirgs hosting an agn , while the other mainly contains bcds or pure starburst galaxies .",
    "two dashed lines are drawn as a guide to identify the two branches .",
    "[ os3_neratio ] ]    in figure  [ os3_neratio ] , we plot the line ratios of [ oiv]25.89@xmath0m/[siii]33.48@xmath0 m as a function of [ neiii]15.56@xmath0m/[neii]12.81@xmath0 m for our bcds , starburst galaxies agns and ulirgs .",
    "we choose to use the line ratio of [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m and [ siii]33.48@xmath0 m because of their large difference in the ionization potential , and the absence of aperture effects , as both lines reside in the same irs long - high module ( see also figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we use the [ neiii]/[neii ] line ratio as the other variable , as it is commonly used as an indicator of the strength of the euv radiation field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since both [ neiii ] and [ neii ] lines are of the same element , the ratio is independent of the gas abundance .",
    "we clearly see that the [ oiv]/[siii ] ratio separates agns from bcds , with agns having in general a factor of 10 higher [ oiv]/[siii ] ratios than bcds , even though they have similar [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios .",
    "starburst galaxies display smaller [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios than agns and bcds , but their values of the [ oiv]/[siii ] ratio vary . in particular , it appears that starburst galaxies populate two branches with a common origin ( the dashed lines in figure  [ os3_neratio ] ) , one pointing towards the locus of agns and the other to the bcds . among the starburst galaxies ,",

    "the galaxies ic342 , ngc3556 , and ngc4818 have no detected [ oiv ] emission and their upper limits are indicated with arrows on the plot .",
    "given that the gas in agns and bcds is excited by distinctly different physical mechanisms , the fact that they are found at the corresponding ends of the two branches of the diagram , also suggests that the excitation mechanisms leading to the [ oiv ] line emission in starbursts galaxies populating the two branches is different .",
    "this could be understood if the mid - ir emission of starbursts in the upper branch is due to some agn component , while in starbursts of the lower branch is only due to the reprocessing of pure stellar radiation .",
    "therefore , such a diagram can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the origin of the dust enshrouded energy source in star forming galaxies .",
    "interestingly , among the starbursts located in the upper branch , six also have detected [ nev]14.32@xmath0 m emission ( see * ? ? ?",

    "five galaxies ( ngc520 , ngc253 , ngc1614 , ngc4676 and ngc7252 ) which do not have a confirmed agn signature so far , are located in the lower left corner of the plot , where the two branches merge . since at this area of the plot classification is more ambiguous , it is possible that a weak agn component could be present , even though its [ nev ] emission is too weak to be detected .",
    "unfortunately , in most of the ulirgs with available irs high resolution spectroscopy , their [ siii]33.48@xmath0 m emission lines are redshifted out of the wavelength coverage of the irs ( see * ? ? ?",

    "that have both [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m and [ siii]33.48@xmath0 m detected , 9 are located on the upper branch and they all have detected [ nev ] emission .",
    "iras09022 - 3615 is the only ulirg with no [ nev ] detection and it is located between the two branches .",
    "this is again consistent with the assertion that star forming galaxies with an agn component do follow the upper branch .",
    "the lower branch of the diagram seems to be populated by sources in which the ionizing radiation is due only to stellar photospheres .",
    "in addition to the bcds , the pure starburst galaxies ngc7714 , ngc3310 , and ngc1222 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) are located in the lower branch before the two branches merge .",
    "moving along the branch towards higher values of the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , the metallicity overall decreases ( see  4 ) .",
    "the harder radiation field produced by the low metallicity environment strongly increases the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio ( by up to a factor of 100 ) , but increases only moderately the [ oiv]/[siii ] ratio ( by a factor of 10 ) .",
    "this was also noticed by @xcite , who indicated that low - metallicity dwarfs exhibit relatively stronger [ oiv ] than low - excitation starbursts , but the effect is not very pronounced compared to the large excitation difference as measured by the [ neiii]/[neii ] .",
    "one galaxy with a detected [ nev ] emission ( ngc3628 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is on the lower branch .",
    "we note though that its location is also at the far left where the two branches merge , and as a result it does not contradict our bifurcation scheme .",

    "[ os3_sratio ] ]    as with the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , the ratio of [ siv]10.51@xmath0m/[siii]18.71@xmath0 m has also been widely used as a probe of the hardness of the ionization field . when plotting the [ oiv]25.89@xmath0m/[siii]33.48@xmath0 m as a function of the [ siv]/[siii ] line ratio , we observe a similar bifurcation signature ( see figure  [ os3_sratio ] ) .",
    "the sources located on the upper and lower branches in figure  [ os3_sratio ] are the same to the ones found on the upper and lower branches in figure  [ os3_neratio ] .",
    "the separation of the two branches though is not as clear as in figure  [ os3_neratio ] , mainly because of the narrower range of the [ siv]/[siii ] values for our sample than the range of the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios .",
    "in addition , in several starbursts ( 8 out of the 24 galaxies ) no [ siv ] emission was detected , thus making a clear definition of the merging points of the two branches challenging .",
    "close examination of the [ oiv]/[siii ] vs. [ neiii]/[neii ] diagram presented in the previous section suggests that it can be used as an agn - starburst diagnostic , similar to the log([nii]/h@xmath1 ) vs. log([oiii]/h@xmath2 ) diagram ( e.g. the bpt diagram , * ? ? ?",

    "we have already shown in  3.2 and  3.3 that the [ oiv ] diagram can successfully identify galaxies where an agn contributes to their mid - ir spectrum as they are placed on the upper branch of the figure  [ os3_neratio ] . in this section",
    ", we present a preliminary analysis on the nature of the [ oiv ] emission in the starburst galaxies and bcds of the lower branch , focusing on the interpretation of models which include wr stars and shocks . more detailed study on this subject will be presented in an upcoming paper .",

    "they show features of wr stars in their optical spectra , most commonly the broad heii@xmath22 emission which has an ip of @xmath23ev , similar to [ oiv ] . therefore , identifying correlations between wr features and [ oiv ] emission could , in principle , reveal the contribution of those stars .",
    "we cross - matched our bcds with the wr galaxy catalog presented in @xcite and found that seven bcds ( izw18 , sbs0335 - 052e , um461 , iizw40 , ngc1569 , mrk1450 , and ngc1140 ) as well as two starbursts ( ngc1614 and ngc7714 ) have reported wr features .    unfortunately , this wr galaxy sample is small , and there are no consistent measurements of the optical wr features from the literature .",
    "thus a direct correlation of the wr strength and the [ oiv ] line emission could not be established . in figure  [ os3_neratio ]",
    "we have marked these wr galaxies @xcite as filled symbols .",
    "it appears that at least the detections of wr signatures are not closely associated with high [ oiv]/[siii ] ratios , instead , they appear to be more correlated with high [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios .",

    "we perform a tentative exploration of the contribution of those stars to the presence of the o@xmath13 ion in our lower branch galaxies with starburst 99 ( leitherer 1999 ) and cloudy ( ferland 2001 ) .",
    "we use starburst 99 to model the stellar radiation field of an instantaneous burst of star formation aging from 1 to 10 myrs .",
    "all stars have a metallicity of 1/3 z@xmath4 and the follow a salpeter imf . the output from starburst 99",
    "is used as input to cloudy in order to estimate the flux of the mid - ir emission lines .",
    "the models predict that the presence of considerable [ oiv ] emission is directly related to the appearance of the wolf - rayet phases , becoming strong around 4 myrs after the onset of the burst and fading to undetectable levels 2 myrs later .",
    "on the other hand , the [ neiii ] line is related to the presence of massive main sequence o stars but also becomes very weak after 6 myrs .",
    "both [ neii ] and [ siii ] lines are still strong after 10 myrs .",
    "consequently the [ oiv]/[siii ] and [ neiii]/[neii ] line ratios peak around 4 - 5 myrs after the onset of the burst with values of @xmath140.6 and 40 respectively .",
    "the value of 0.6 for the [ oiv]/[siii ] line ratio agrees with the highest value observed in the galaxies of the lower branch in figure  [ os3_neratio ] , but the predicted [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is about a factor of 4 higher than the observed value .",
    "clearly a more systematic study exploring thoroughly the parameter space of the models and comparing them to larger sample of galaxies with mid - ir measurements is required to further investigate this discrepancy .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the mid - infrared emission lines for a sample of 12 low metallicity blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies based on high resolution observations obtained with infrared spectrograph on board the _ spitzer _  space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our sample with a local sample of typical starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , to study the ionization field of starbursts over a broad range of physical parameters and examine its difference from the one produced by agn . the high - ionization line [ oiv]25.89@xmath0 m is detected in most of the bcds , starbursts , and agns in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a diagnostic diagram of the line ratios [ oiv]25.89@xmath0m/[siii]33.48@xmath0 m as a function of [ neiii]15.56@xmath0m/[neii]12.81@xmath0 m which can be useful in identifying the principal excitation mechanism in a galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in this diagram split naturally into two branches . </S>",
    "<S> classic agns as well as starburst galaxies with an agn component populate the upper branch , with stronger agns displaying higher [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios . </S>",
    "<S> bcds and pure starbursts are located in the lower branch . </S>",
    "<S> we find that overall the placement of galaxies on this diagram correlates well with their corresponding locations in the log([nii]/h@xmath1 ) vs. log([oiii]/h@xmath2 ) diagnostic diagram , which has been widely used in the optical . </S>",
    "<S> the two diagrams provide consistent classifications of the excitation mechanism in a galaxy . on the other hand , the diagram of [ neiii]15.56@xmath0m/[neii]12.81@xmath0 m vs. [ siv]10.51@xmath0m/[siii]18.71@xmath0 m is not as efficient in separating agns from bcds and pure starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis demonstrates that bcds in general do display higher [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ siv]/[siii ] line ratios than starbursts , with some reaching values even higher than those found at the centers of agns . despite their hard radiation field </S>",
    "<S> though , no [ nev]14.32@xmath0 m emission has been detected in the bcds of our sample . </S>"
