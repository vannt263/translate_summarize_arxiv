    "@xcite in addition to the appearance of a peak at @xmath4 , another well defined peak was noticed at 20 k. this peak was defined as spin reorientation temperature ( @xmath10 ) and this appeared when external magnetic field was non - coincident with the easy - axis direction .",

    "@xcite recently , a theoretical investigation of mce was performed in detail on hoal@xmath1 where a valley was predicted in thermal variation of mce .",
    "@xcite this valley was suggested due to spin reorientation at low temperature from @xmath3 easy direction toward applied field direction along @xmath2 .    in this article , we present magnetocaloric properties of single crystalline hoal@xmath1 both from the temperature and field dependent magnetization and mr results along @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions . a large anisotropy in magnetic and magnetoresistance results along major crystallographic axes is evidenced below @xmath4 , although hoal@xmath1 has cubic laves phase structure .",
