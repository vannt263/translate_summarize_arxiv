    "these attractive forces , although weaker in magnitude than ionic or covalent bonds between atoms or molecules , are ubiquitous across nature and can play a central role in soft matter and biophysical systems .",
    "examples range from protein folding@xcite to the adhesive properties of gecko feet@xcite .",
    "while the present work can not describe the contact regime where the van der waals force is strongest , it does suggest that noncontacting regions may contribute more than previously suspected to the energetics , in cases where pi - conjugation , for example , may lead to near - metallic behavior in low - dimensional structures .",

    "tube attraction is important in a description of the cohesive energetics of nanotube bundles@xcite .",
    "recently the differing asymptotic behavior of vdw interactions for conducting systems , compared to insulating systems with identical geometry , has been displayed for various systems @xcite .",
    "the simplest standard techniques applied in computing the vdw interaction are based on the pairwise summation of all @xmath0 contributions @xcite between microscopic elements separated by distance r , and so inherently assume local properties of the two materials .",
    "more sophisticated techniques @xcite when coupled with the usual assumption of a local bulk  like dielectric function within the boundaries of the constituents , still lead to an interaction asymptotically equivalent to a sum of @xmath0 contributions .",
    "recently , progress has been made in formalisms that describe both the contact region of electron cloud overlap , as well as a dispersion contribution at large distances @xcite .",
    "however these theories predict the usual asymptotic @xmath1 behavior and so could still be improved with respect to description of low - dimensional systems with a small or zero electronic energy gap .    for a determination of the vdw interaction between highly anisotropic systems of metallic nature ,",
    "a pairwise summation method fails to incorporate the long wavelength , incompletely screened electron density fluctuations .",
    "these lead to unexpected power laws for the vdw interaction as a function of separation @xcite .",
    "the effects of this physics appear in calculations on parallel 1d electron gases @xcite , on two dimensional electron gases @xcite , and in graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "more recently this has been highlighted as a more general phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the greatest underestimation of the vdw interaction occurs between distant parallel quasi one  dimensional conductors @xcite .",
    "the coupled plasmon approach addresses the shortfalls of the pairwise summation technique , incorporating polarization between multiplets of atoms in the system and also electron movement within the wires . in modelling the electronic motions as coupled plasmons , large electron displacement across many atoms in a system",
    "is allowed to occur , providing a less constrained representation of electron movement .",
    "plasmon frequencies can be determined by application of electron hydrodynamics and the vdw dispersion energy then corresponds to the separation dependent part of the sum of zero point plasmon energies .",
    "this approach has been employed previously in determination of the vdw interaction between systems of thin parallel metallic plates and also thin parallel metallic wires .",
    "the sum of plasmon energies is also known to provide an approximation to the full correlation energy in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "( see e.g. [ 13 ] ) .",
    "a full rpa energy calculation would thus provide a natural and seamless extension to the present method , valid at all separations including the regime of full electronic cloud overlap .",
    "for two thin parallel metallic plates of infinite area , separated by a distance greater than the thickness of the plates , bstrom and sernelius @xcite , and dobson and wang @xcite have applied the coupled plasmon approach to obtain a dispersion energy of dependence @xmath2 on the separation distance d of the metal slabs .",
    "this result is in agrement with the appropriate limit of microscopic random phase approximation calculations for a pair of two dimensional electron gases performed by sernelius and bjrk @xcite .",
    "a pairwise summation analysis for this system of thin parallel metallic plates gives a @xmath3 dependence of the vdw attraction , notably smaller at large separation than the @xmath2 dependence derived by applying the coupled plasmon approach .",

    "the dispersion interaction , calculated by a standard sum of @xmath0 contributions between microscopic elements separated by distance @xmath4 , has a @xmath5 dependence on the separation distance , @xmath6 , of the two wires .",
    "however an analysis of the zero  point energy of the delocalized coupled one  dimensional plasmon modes parallel to the long axis , modelled for wires of length @xmath7 , finds the vdw interaction to have a @xmath8 dependence on separation distance , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the smearing radius of a wire , representing the finite extent of the electronic wave  function or electronic density fluctuation on the wire in the direction perpendicular to the long axis .",
    "the analysis assumes an electron mean free path greater than the separation distance of the wires , which can be satisfied by bismuth nanowires@xcite and conducting nanotubes@xcite .",
    "the vdw interaction ( [ parallelwires ] ) is almost three powers of @xmath6 greater than that obtained in a standard pairwise summation framework .",
    "this highlights the importance of including electron movement and screening from subsequent polarization of electron pairs in conducting systems .",
    "the occurrence of an enhanced dispersion interaction in metallic systems might have repercussions , particularly in nanotechnology .",
    "the above considerations suggest metallic and non  metallic nanotubes could experience different cohesive forces , for example though analysis beyond the present methods would be needed to explore this possibility in the case of electron cloud overlap . in the present paper",
    "we explore another case @xcite where a sum of @xmath0 contributions does not yield a correct description of the vdw interactions .",
    "we consider two linear structures ( `` wires '' ) , each of length @xmath10 , in a collinear `` pointing '' configuration as shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath6 is the separation between the near ends of the wires , while @xmath11 is the distance between the centers of the wires .",
    "@xmath9 is an effective radius of the wire , discussed further below .",
    "our motivation for looking at this case was threefold .",
    "firstly , there is intrinsic interest in the cohesive properties of nanostructures of all kinds , and the present work is particularly relevant to the interactions of carbon nanotubes , a technologically important case .",
    "secondly , recent work @xcite has suggested that van der waals forces may be involved in the surprisingly strong force that tends to make the tips of iron micro ",
    "whiskers grow towards one another during fluidized  bed iron ore reduction processes .",
    "while it is not clear that the electron mean free path in these cases is sufficiently long to validate the assumptions of the present work , it is interesting that our approach can predict vdw forces between linear conducting systems in the appropriate `` pointing '' geometry , that are enhanced compared with standard vdw theory .",
    "thirdly , a numerical investigation of wires of finite length allows us to look at a region of relatively close coupling where , although the electronic clouds are not permitted to overlap , we are still far from the truly asymptotic regime where a single power law describes the force .",
    "we find that the dispersion interaction between the wires shows strong differences between metallic and insulating cases even in this non - asymptotic regime , reinforcing asymptotic results @xcite already known in other geometries .",
    "we further find that the greater interaction at large distances in the metallic case does _ not _ imply a lesser interaction at small distances in the metallic case , contrary to a false expectation based on a single power law at all distances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the analytic work will be presented in section [ analytics ] , and section [ numerics ] then outlines the numerics .",
    "our results and discussion compare the dispersion interaction between wires in the `` pointing '' geometry for insulators and conductors and are presented in section [ resultsanddisc ] .",
    "the principal findings and future prospects are discussed in the final section .",
    "we evaluate the dispersion interaction between the two wires by the coupled  plasmon approach ( see e.g.  ref .  [ 12],[13],[14 ] ) .",
    "plasmons are quantized versions of the wavelike collective motions of the electrons .",
    "the equilibrium /ground state of the wire is described by a constant electron number density per unit length , @xmath12 .",
    "plasma waves entail a perturbation @xmath13 to the number density , where we have defined a variable x ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) to label positions along the wire .    here",
    "we neglect electronic radial and azimuthal motions  i.e.those perpendicular to the long axis .",
    "these are frozen out by quantum effects in atomically thin systems , but can be present in other cases .",
    "we do not consider them here because , for the thin linear systems of interest here , they consist of spatially constrained electronic motions leading to conventional van der waals force laws . by contrast",
    "the unconstrained electronic motions along the wire will be shown below to lead to an unconventional , enhanced long ranged van der waals interaction that is the principal focus of attention here . for example , the azimuthal electronic motions have been considered by rotkin and hess @xcite , in the case of two long parallel nanotubes .",
    "they considered only small separations between the tubes and found these modes to give a more rapidly decaying van der waals interaction as a function of nanotube separation @xmath6 , compared to the purely longitudinal modes investigated in [ 11 ] .",
    "thus we expect that our neglect of the electronic motions perpendicular to the long axis will not affect the long  ranged forces that we are investigating here .        to describe the electronic motions along the wire we use a conventional hydrodynamical picture , valid even for degenerate quantal electrons in the limit of long  wavelength perturbations . during the plasmon motion , the electron fluid element that was at position @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in the unperturbed state of the wire ( bold lines in fig .",
    "1 ) is displaced to position @xmath15 ( dotted lines in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in the simplest hydrodynamical model ( correct to lowest order in the wavenumber @xmath16 of the wave ) the motion of the fluid element is described by newton s second law for a a free mass under the action of a mean potential energy function @xmath17 generated by the coulomb interaction with other fluid elements : @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the electron effective mass for motion along the wire .",
    "an element of electron fluid at a point on any wire will experience a coulomb potential due to electrons at every other point on that wire and also due to those at every point on the adjacent collinear wire .",
    "considering plasmons in one dimension , evidently the fourier transform of the coulomb potential does not converge .",
    "however , by recognizing that the one electron wavefunctions are of finite extent in the direction perpendicular to the wire , we can examine a symmetrically ` smeared ' version of the wire with finite smearing radius , @xmath9 . while we apply a radially smeared pair potential , expressed explicitly as @xmath20 in our work to follow , any expression that saturates the coulomb interaction for @xmath21 would give similar results for the long - wavelength fluctuation phenomena that drive the unusual effects to be explored here .",
    "the force on an element of electron fluid at a point in time can be expressed using the radially smeared pair potential , @xmath22 , as : @xmath23 this applies for either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "we apply a linearized form of the continuity equation , @xmath26 to describe the perturbation to the electron number density in terms of the equilibrium number of electrons per unit length of wire , @xmath27 .",
    "plasmon movement within metallic wires is confined by requiring zero electron displacement at the wire ends .",
    "an alternative analysis , in which the zero boundary condition occurring at the wire ends is naturally inherent , could be obtained by applying a sine  basis decomposition .",
    "note that different boundary conditions , such as allowing the electron gas to move out over the ends of the uniform positive background , which would then cause a restoring force , could be applied instead , and possibly would provide a further alternative description of the plasmon modes .",
    "we seek time  periodic separable solutions of ( [ newtonii ] ) in the form @xmath28    the left ",
    "right symmetry evident in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] requires that there exist even solutions for which @xmath29 and also odd solutions for which @xmath30 .",
    "we used this property and put ( [ xx ] ) and ( [ lincontinuity ] ) into ( [ newtonii ] ) . integrating by parts and using the explicit form of the smeared coulomb potential ( [ cp ] ) we obtained    @xmath31    eq .",
    "( [ dimensionedeqmotionnopressnopin ] ) holds for either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , and is an eigenvalue equation for the frequencies @xmath34 of self - sustaining plasma oscillations , ( plasmons ) corresponding to coupled charge density fluctuations on the two wires .",
    "the dispersion energy @xmath35 is then the part of the total plasmon zero - point energy that depends on the separation @xmath6 between the wires .",
    "thus    @xmath36    application of numerical techniques is necessary to solve for the eigenfrequencies @xmath37 , as the broken translational symmetry of the collinear wire geometry with a gap prevents fourier transformation being used to solve the integral equation ( [ dimensionedeqmotionnopressnopin ] ) analytically in k  space .",
    "although the eigenvalue problem ( [ dimensionedeqmotionnopressnopin ] ) derived from the expression for the force felt on an element of electron fluid at a point could now be solved to give us odd and even solutions for the plasmon frequency , we extend this to incorporate the contribution to the force felt by an element of electron fluid from the internal pressure of the electron fluid . this electronic pressure is caused mainly by velocity deviation of electrons in a fluid element from the average velocity .",
    "it is the electron pressure term that distinguishes our formalism from a purely classical newton ii approach , and it introduces the quantal and pauli - principle physics ( electron degeneracy pressure ) into the formalism .",
    "we expect it should give higher frequencies to the plasmon modes with rapid spatial variation . without the pressure term",
    "the theory correctly describes the response of a free electron gas in the limit of long wavelength , and it agrees with the corresponding limit of the quantal lindhard response .",
    "this limit was adequate in [ 12 ] because there the treatment was limited to the asymptotic regime of distant interactions between infinitely long wires , where the long - wavelength fluctuations completely dominate .",
    "here we want to explore wires of finite length at finite separations . while the new phenomena which we expose will still turn out to be due to long - wavelength fluctuations , a detailed treatment needs to account , for example , for the reduced polarizability of a short wire of length @xmath10 resulting from the requirement to excite wavelengths of @xmath38 in order to polarize its electron gas . for this reason",
    "we introduce the plasma pressure , in the simplest available model . in some regimes it also aids in achieving numerical stability of the solutions .    the excess pressure due to a density perturbation @xmath39 is usually modelled from an analysis of the free fermi gas @xcite as @xmath40",
    "here @xmath39 is the three dimensional density perturbation and @xmath41 is a velocity of the order of the fermi velocity of the metal .",
    "we take @xmath42 .",
    "the pressure can now be expressed in terms of the equilibrium pressure @xmath43 , and the perturbation to the electron number density per unit length , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 .",
    "now @xmath41 is of order of the fermi velocity of the metal composing a wire .",
    "the pressure force per electron , to be added to the right side of ( [ newtonii ] ) , is then @xmath46 where from the linearized continuity ( eq ( [ lincontinuity ] ) ) , the perturbation to the electron number density has again been expressed as a function of the equilibrium number density , @xmath47 and the displacement , @xmath4 of an electron fluid element .",
    "the prior analysis , applying a coupled plasmon approach , accounts for conduction of electrons and so provides a more complete description in evaluating the vdw interaction between two conducting collinear wires .",
    "however , we would expect the pairwise summation method of individual @xmath0 atomic contributions , which does not allow for electron movement along the wires , to remain an apt description of the dispersion interaction between insulating wires with a sufficiently large gap .",
    "we therefore applied two different modifications to the theory described above : each is designed to explore the difference between metallic and non - metallic wires .",
    "\\(a ) a modified pairwise additive approach was applied to calculate the dispersion interaction between two collinear insulating wires . using ( [ dimensionedeqmotionnopressnopin ] ) , ( [ pressforce ] ) and",
    "( [ dimensionededisp ] ) , we first calculated numerically and tabulated the dispersion interaction energy @xmath48 of short metallic wires of length @xmath49 with separation @xmath50 between the ends .",
    "( for fixed @xmath51 we found @xmath52 to be of the conventional form @xmath53 as expected :  see the results section below ) .",
    "we then modelled a long _ insulating _ wire of length @xmath54 @xmath55 by a collection of short wire segments of equal length @xmath56 , placed end to end , but with electrons not allowed to flow from segment to segment .",
    "this crudely represents individual atoms or bonds on an insulating wire , as electron movement along the wire is restricted , now being confined to within each wire segment . assuming the mutual polarization between any two wire segments is not affected by any other wire segment composing the collinear wire system , the pre - tabulated dispersion interaction @xmath57 can be used between any two segments of length @xmath56 lying in opposite wires , and separated by distance @xmath58 .",
    "summation of the dispersion interaction between each segment on one wire and all segments on the opposite wire ( as illustrated in fig .",

    "numerical convergence of the dispersion interaction with respect to @xmath76 was also verified .",
    "a larger @xmath76 corresponds to dividing the integral into more partitions ; consequently , as more `` points '' along the wire are sampled , larger @xmath76 means plasmon modes with shorter wavelengths are also sampled .",
    "the lowest plasmon mode wavelengths are expected to contribute negligibly to the dispersion interaction , so for sufficiently large @xmath76 numerical convergence of the vdw interaction should be evident .",

    "increasing the internal pressure , corresponding to using a larger fermi velocity , gives a more rapid convergence of the dispersion interaction with respect to @xmath76 and a weaker vdw attraction between the two wires .",

    "the basic approach described above should apply to any system where there is an essentially one - dimensional electron gas with long mean free path , such as a metallic nanowire or the conduction band of a metallic ( n , n ) carbon nanotube .",
    "the results using ( [ dimlessequmotion ] ) are dimensionless and therefore universal in a sense",

    "our dimensionless lengths are defined in terms of the coulomb smearing length @xmath9 , which is taken to be the radius of the quasi-1d electron gas , e.g. the tube radius in the nanotube case .",
    "it is also necessary to choose the dimensionless input parameters @xmath124 , @xmath125 to suit the particular system .    for the numerical work below we chose parameters roughly appropriate to the conduction band of a ( 5,5 ) single - walled carbon nanotube .",

    ", width=302 ]    for each chosen value of @xmath158 , the plot settles down to a constant value @xmath172 for @xmath173 , which confirms the expectation .",
    "this basic @xmath159 behavior is observed both for metallic wires and for semiconducting wires ( modelled by adding a pinning force as described above ) .  for a given wire length @xmath174 , the coefficient @xmath175 depends considerably on the pinning frequency @xmath151 i.e. metallic wires ( @xmath176 ) attract more strongly than insulating ones with the same concentration of van der waals interacting electrons , but still with a @xmath159 law for the energy .",
    "much more interesting is the behavior of the dispersion energy when the separation @xmath154 is less than the length @xmath158 . here",
    "a single dipole does not adequately represent the electronic response of a wire , and consequently no single power law @xmath177 emerges for the energy @xmath178 because a multipolar expansion would be required in order to generalize the dipolar argument .",
    "we are therefore out of the `` asymptotic '' region of a distant vdw interaction , though still not in a region of electronic cloud overlap . in this regime",
    ", a conventional approach would be to sum ( integrate ) contributions of form @xmath179 from small segments of the two wires at positions @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively .",
    "this approach predicts that , for fixed @xmath154 , the dispersion energy for increasing wire length @xmath158 will saturate rapidly as soon as @xmath158 exceeds @xmath154 , to a value proportional to @xmath182 .",
    "we find that this saturation does occur for insulating wires , as modelled either with a substantial pinning frequency @xmath151 , or by cutting a metallic wire into mutually insulated pieces shorter than the separation .",
    "it is definitely not  true for intact metallic wires ( @xmath164 ) as modelled by our full numerical coupled - plasmon approach . in the metallic case",
    "the interaction continues to grow with wire length and still has not saturated for wires many times longer than the separation .",
    "these findings are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    ".,width=302 ]    we also investigated the behavior of our coupled - plasmon interaction right down to zero separation of the wires :  see fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "of course a realistic treatment of this regime would require the inclusion of covalent and other forces that are not described in our formalism and that are specific to the particular quasi-1d system .",
    "furthermore a detailed plasmon treatment even of the dispersion part of the energy in this regime would require electronic response functions beyond the long - wavelength description that we have used .",
    "however our results establish the important result that our method saturates naturally to a finite value at contact , unlike empirical van der waals correction schemes of the @xmath183 type , which have to be cut off in a somewhat arbitrary manner to avoid divergence .",
    "another significant conclusion from our numbers in this small - separation regime concerns the relative strength of the dispersion energy for metallic and nonmetallic cases . because the analytic results in various geometries @xcite for the metallic interaction fall off with a lower power and hence dominate the insulating result at large distance",
    ", one might speculate that the opposite ordering holds at small separation - i.e. that the insulating interaction is stronger than the metallic one at small separation .",
    "however such an argument depends on the assumption of the same single power law for small separations as well as large .",
    "this is not the case , and at small separations @xmath184 a power series rather than a single power would be required for this type of analysis .",
    "in fact our results show that the metallic attraction is stronger than the insulating one at all separations , for constant electron number density .",
    "we have explored the dispersion interaction between two collinear one - dimensional electronic systems ( `` wires '' ) separated by a vacuum gap , in the electromagnetically non - retarded regime .",
    "we considered the metallic case and also two models of an insulating / semiconducting case .",
    "the metallic case was modelled via free one - dimensional electrons with an electronic pressure term , but this model was also matched to a quantum band model for the electrons for the purpose of modelling the conduction electron bands in carbon nanotubes .",
    "for the insulating cases , either a harmonic pinning force was added to the equations , or a model of very short , mutually insulated metallic pieces was used , with rather similar results to the case of a pinning force .",
    "our calculations provide significant insight additional to that previously obtained from asymptotic dispersion energy calculations @xcite on low - dimensional systems with at least one infinite spatial dimension .",
    "these previous analytic calculations were all performed for the asymptotic regime where a single power law ( sometimes multiplied by a logarithm ) suffices to describe the dispersion energy as a function of separation @xmath6 .",
    "these previous works showed that the distant interaction in these highly anisotropic systems shows major qualitative differences between the metallic and insulating cases . specifically , the power law is different in the two cases , with the metallic interaction being stronger in the asymptotic regime studied .",
    "in contrast to those fully asymptotic calculations , we treated wires of finite length @xmath10 , with a finite separation @xmath6 between their ends , a regime where a single power law in @xmath6 does not describe the interaction . unlike the asymptotic cases , we find that the interaction at finite separations is a continuous function of the pinning frequency ( i.e. a continuous function of the electronic energy gap ) .",
    "our coupled - plasmon dispersion energy does however remain a strong function of the gap right down to the limit of contacting wires , where it remains finite , unlike asymptotic formulae for the same quantity . in particular",
    "we find a large difference between the attractive dispersion energy of the most polarizable electron bands of metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes .",
    "the dispersion energy was found to decrease monotonically with energy gap at all values of @xmath10 and @xmath6 that we studied .",
    "we also found that a conventional pairwise summation of terms of form @xmath185 is not an adequate description of metallic wires , with a major discrepancy between this model and our coupled - plasmon results .",
    "specifically , the coupled - plasmon energy , while similar to the summation approach for very short wires , continues to grow with length @xmath10 at fixed separation @xmath6 , while the @xmath186 energy saturates rapidly to an @xmath187 value that is much smaller than the coupled - plasmon energy .    a more detailed microscopic model , including a detailed orbital description with pauli repulsion and non - dispersive bonding forces , will be required to describe the cohesive forces at distances where the electronic clouds overlap .",
    "the present results suggest , however , that long - wavelength coupled charge fluctuations will still enhance the van der waals force at these distances , necessitating a highly nonlocal model of the coulomb screening even in this limit . theories that yield a @xmath188 asymptotics can not be relied upon to achieve this ."
