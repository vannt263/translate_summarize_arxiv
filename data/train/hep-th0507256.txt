    "the cosmological implications of superstring theory have been under attentive consideration in the last few years from various viewpoints @xcite .",
    "this involves the classification and the study of possible time - evolving string backgrounds which amounts to the construction , classification and analysis of supergravity solutions depending only on time or , more generally , on a low number of coordinates including time . in this context",
    "a quite challenging and potentially highly relevant phenomenon for the overall interpretation of extra  dimensions and string dynamics is provided by the so named _ cosmic billiard _",
    "phenomenon @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this is based on a profound link between the features of time evolution of the cosmological scale factors and the algebraic structure of string theory duality groups . as it is well known , the dualities that unify the various perturbative quantum string models into a unique m - theory are elements of a unified group @xmath9 which is the suitable restriction to integers of a corresponding lie group @xmath10 encoded in the low energy limit of superstrings , namely supergravity .",
    "the group @xmath11 appears as isometry group of the scalar manifold @xmath12 emerging in compactifications of @xmath13dimensional supergravity to lower dimensions and crucially depends on the geometry of the compact dimensions and on the number of preserved supersymmetries @xmath14 . for @xmath15 the scalar",
    "manifold is always a homogeneous space @xmath16 and what actually happens is that the cosmological scale factors @xmath17 associated with the various dimensions of space  time can be interpreted as exponentials of those scalar fields @xmath18 which lie in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath19 , while the other scalar fields in @xmath16 correspond to positive roots @xmath20 of the lie algebra @xmath19 . in this way the cosmological evolution is described by the motion of a _ fictitious ball _ in the csa of @xmath19 .",
    "this space is actually a billiard table whose walls are the hyperplanes orthogonal to the various roots .",
    "the fictitious ball bounces on the billiard walls and this means that there are inversions in the time evolution of scale factors .",
    "certain dimensions that were expanding almost suddenly begin to contract and others do the reverse .",
    "such a scenario was introduced by damour , henneaux , julia and nicolai in @xcite , and in a series of papers with collaborators @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , which generalize classical results obtained in the context of pure general relativity @xcite,@xcite . in this approach",
    "the cosmic billiard phenomenon is analyzed as an asymptotic regime in the neighborhood of space - like singularities and the billiard walls are seen as delta function potentials provided by the various @xmath21forms of supergravity localized at sharp instants of time .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the fundamental mathematical setup underlying the appearance of the billiard phenomenon is the so named _",
    "solvable lie algebra parametrization _ of supergravity scalar manifolds , pioneered in @xcite and later applied to the solution of a large variety of superstring / supergravity problems , including the structure of supersymmetric black - hole solutions @xcite,@xcite , the construction of gauged sugra potentials@xcite , @xcite and several other issues ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed we pointed out in those papers that , thanks to the solvable parametrization , one can establish a precise algorithm to implement the following programme :    1 .",
    "reduce the original supergravity in higher dimensions @xmath22 ( for instance @xmath23 ) to a gravity - coupled @xmath24model in @xmath25 where gravity is non  dynamical and where the original higher dimensional bosonic field equations reduce to geodesic equations for a solvable group - manifold metrically equivalent to a non compact coset manifold @xmath26    \\cong \\mathrm{u / h}$ ] .",
    "2 .   utilize the algebraic structure of the solvable lie algebra @xmath27 in order to integrate analytically the geodesic equations .",
    "in particular we introduced in @xcite a general method of integration , named the _",
    "@xmath28-compensator method _ which reduces the geodesic differential equations to a triangular form and hence to quadratures when @xmath16 is maximally split , which is always the case when supersymmetry is maximal ( @xmath29 ) 3 .",
    "dimensionally oxide the solutions obtained in this way to exact time dependent solutions of @xmath22 supergravity .",
    "in particular we showed in @xcite that the oxidation process is not unique but is algebraically classified by the embedding of _ weyl orbits _ of subalgebras @xmath30 . indeed the analytic structure of the solution is fully determined only by the algebraic structure of @xmath31 .",
    "its physical interpretation varies and depends on the explicit embedding @xmath32 . in this way",
    "each solution in @xmath25 corresponds to an entire orbit of higher dimensional backgrounds , very different from one another , but dual to each other under transformations of the weyl group @xmath33 .    within this approach",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the _ cosmic billiard phenomenon _ is indeed a general feature of exact time dependent solutions of supergravity and has _",
    "smooth realizations_. calling @xmath34 the @xmath35component vector of cartan fields ( where @xmath35 is the rank of @xmath19 ) and @xmath36 its projection along any positive root @xmath37 , a _ bounce _ occurs at those instant of times @xmath38 such that : @xmath39 namely when the cartan field in the direction of some root @xmath37 inverts its behaviour and begins to shrink if it was growing or viceversa begins to grow if it was shrinking .",
    "since all higher dimensional bosonic fields ( off - diagonal components of the metric @xmath40 or @xmath21forms @xmath41}$ ] ) are , via the solvable parametrization of @xmath16 , in one - to - one correspondence with roots @xmath42 , it follows that the bounce on a _ wall _ ( hyperplane orthogonal to the root @xmath37 ) is caused by the sudden growing of that particular field @xmath43 .",
    "indeed we showed in @xcite that in exact smooth solutions which we were able to obtain by means of the compensator method , each bounce is associated with a typical bell - shaped behaviour of the root field @xmath43 and that the whole process can be interpreted as a temporary localization of the universe energy density in a _ lump _ on a spatial brane associated with the field @xmath43 .",
    "although very much encouraging the analysis of @xcite was still limited in three respects :    a : :    the dimensional reduction process which is responsible for making    manifest the duality algebra @xmath44 and hence for    creating the whole algebraic machinery utilized in deriving the    _ smooth cosmic billiard solutions _ was stopped at @xmath3 ,    namely at the first point where all the bosonic degrees of freedom can    be represented by scalars . in @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath19 is still a finite dimensional lie algebra and    the whole richness of the underlying algebraic structure is not yet    displayed .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , in @xmath6 and    @xmath45 , the algebra @xmath19 becomes a    ka  moody algebra , affine or hyperbolic , respectively .",
    "the smooth    billiard dynamics has to be reconsidered and extended in view of this .",
    "b : :    the constructions of @xcite depend , in some crucial points , on the    assumption that the coset @xmath16 corresponds to a    pair    @xmath46 of lie algebra and lie subalgebra which is _ maximally split_.    this is always the case for maximal supersymmetry    @xmath47 but it is not true for    @xmath14 . extending the @xmath28-compensator    method to _ non maximally split pairs _    @xmath46 is necessary in order to discuss billiard dynamics in lower    susy theories and hence in compactifications of string theory on    internal manifolds @xmath48 with    restricted holonomies and @xmath49-structures , with or without    fluxes .",
    "c : :    the solutions considered in @xcite were solutions of the pure    @xmath24model , namely of pure , ungauged supergravity .",
    "the    extension also to _ gauged supergravities _ is mandatory in order to    make contact with potentially realistic models , in particular with    currently considered flux compactifications .",
    "@xcite    in a recent paper @xcite we have begun to address point @xmath50 of the above list .",
    "there we have shown that the mechanism outlined several years ago by nicolai @xcite as the origin of the ka moody extension of the duality algebra which appears in @xmath3 when you step down to @xmath6 , namely the existence of two non - locally related dimensional reduction schemes @xmath51 , the ehlers reduction and the maztner missner reduction , can be formulated in a general set up which provides a regular scheme of analysis both at the algebraic and at the field theoretical level and which applies to all supergravity theories . in particular",

    "indeed as we have pointed out in @xcite and recalled in table [ tavolona ] taken from @xcite , the tits satake projection commutes with the c - map produced by the dimensional reduction  la ehlers and we have the correspondence : @xmath519 where @xmath520 is the ehlers group coming from the dimensional reduction of pure gravity and @xmath521 denotes the symplectic representation to which vector fields are assigned in @xmath56 .",
    "what is actually preserved in the c - map is the paint group @xmath522 .",
    "hence the dynamical walls are those associated with the tits satake projected model but they come , in the true supergravity theory , in _ painted copies _ , for instance , within the context of our example , the copy @xmath397 and the copy @xmath523 .",
    "the paint group rotates these copies into each other .",
    "the explicit form taken by the diagram ( [ gendecompo2 ] ) in the worked out example studied by the present paper is : @xmath524 the representation @xmath525 of @xmath526 is that of an antisymmetric symplectic traceless tensor : @xmath527 on the other hand the invariance of the paint group through dimensional reduction and oxidation can be easily checked as follows .",
    "first of all we note that @xmath500 is both a subgroup of @xmath205 and of @xmath528 as it is easily verified through the subgroup chain : @xmath529 secondly we note that the non maximally split coset manifold ( [ so12starmanif ] ) appearing in @xmath56 has dimension @xmath189 and rank @xmath530 .",
    "this means that out of the @xmath189 positive roots there are three , @xmath531 , @xmath532 and @xmath533 that are orthogonal to the @xmath530 non  compact cartan generators . together with the three compact cartan generators they make up the same @xmath267 _ paint _",

    "furthermore the remaining @xmath534 non compact roots which together with the @xmath530 non compact cartans span the solvable lie algebra of @xmath535 are accounted for in the following way .",
    "the tits satake projection of @xmath194 is the maximally split lie algebra @xmath536 .",

    "the long roots of @xmath526 correspond to roots of @xmath194 that are singlets under the paint group , while the short ones correspond to roots of @xmath194 which arrange into the following @xmath361 dimensional representation @xmath543 in @xmath3 we have @xmath226-copies of the representation @xmath544 while in @xmath56 we just have @xmath545copies of the same .",
    "it is instructive to compare how the total number of roots is retrieved in the two cases : @xmath546 in eq.([comparus ] ) the second and fourth lines recall that each of the short roots of either @xmath185 or @xmath526 has @xmath226 preimages in the @xmath56 algebra which arrange into a triplet plus a singlet with respect to the diagonal subgroup @xmath547 .",
    "this shows how the structure of the paint group filters through the dimensional reduction .",
    "we can analyze this phenomenon also at the level of the symplectic representation @xmath55 to which the vector fields are assigned .",
    "for the full @xmath101 supergravity model , this representation is the spinorial @xmath548 of @xmath194 .",
    "following the general discussion given in our recent paper @xcite , the @xmath193 weights of this representation are in one to one correspondence with the roots of @xmath183 which have non vanishing grading with respect to the highest root @xmath549 $ ] in the numbering of appendix [ benissimo1 ] .",
    "this root set subdivides into @xmath550 where @xmath551 roots are tits - satake projected into @xmath551 long roots of @xmath185 , while @xmath244 are tits - satake projected into @xmath540 short roots of the same .",
    "the @xmath552-dimensional representation of @xmath526 is just made by these @xmath553 roots of @xmath375 which have non vanishing grading with respect to its own highest root @xmath554 .",
    "indeed , as we have noted in @xcite the tits satake projection of the highest root is the highest root of the target algebra .",
    "the above discussion provides the essential tools to perform the dimensional oxidation of the solutions we have found to full fledged solutions of supergravity models in @xmath56 or even in higher dimensions .",
    "we do not address this issue in the present paper leaving it for further publications where we also plan to provide a systematic analysis of the tits satake projection for all supergravity theories linking it to the properties of the compactification manifolds .",
    "we deem that the present detailed case - study has illustrated the role of the * dimensional reduction invariant paint group * in reducing the study of billiard dynamics to simpler maximally split cosets .",
    "in this paper we have considered one of the two necessary extensions of the analysis of _ smooth cosmic billiards _ initiated by us in @xcite : that to supergravity theories with lesser supersymmetry than the maximal one . the other necessary extension is the further reduction to @xmath555 dimensions , which we have recently addressed in @xcite by studying the universal field  theoretical mechanism of the affine extension .",
    "as displayed in the systematic analysis presented by us in @xcite , lesser supersymmetry involves a general new feature : cosets that are not maximally split and correspond to non maximally non compact real sections of their isometry algebra . for these cosets",
    "the _ compensator method _ devised by us in @xcite can not be directly applied .",
    "yet we have shown in this paper that the dynamical problem can be reduced , also in these cases , to a problem which can be solved with the compensator method .",
    "in fact the original system can be reduced to a maximally split one , performing the tits  satake projection of the original lie algebra .",
    "the solutions of the projected system ( that can be easily found with the compensator method ) are also solutions of the complete one .",
    "moreover , we also showed that many other solutions can be obtained from these by global rotations of a suitable compact group that we named _",
    "paint group_. although we do not have the general integral for these cases , we showed how to obtain a large class of solutions that , probably , are the most relevant from the physical point of view",
    ". + tits satake projection of the original lie algebra has emerged as a central token in discussing cosmic billiards for lesser supersymmetry .",
    "we have illustrated its role by an in depth analysis of a specific example that of @xmath101 supergravity . through this case - study",
    "we were able to extrapolate the main general features that apply to all supergravity models and which we plan to study systematically in a future publication .",
    "in particular we have elucidated the key role of the @xmath0 group , a notion not yet introduced in the literature and leading to the idea of _ painted billiard walls_. the main property of @xmath0 is that it commutes with the c - map , namely with dimensional reduction .",
    "hence it filters through dimensional oxidation and can be retrieved in higher dimensional supergravity .",
    "the main research line that streams from our results is the analysis of the tits satake projection and of its kernel ( the paint group ) in more general contexts , in particular in the context of generic special khler geometry , of which our case study is also an example ( see for instance @xcite for a review ) . furthermore keeping in mind the generic interpretation of the scalar manifold",
    "@xmath12 as _ moduli space _ for the geometry of the _ compactification manifold _ , a calabi yau @xmath556 in the case where @xmath12 is special khlerian , it is challenging to obtain the interpretation of the tits satake projection at the level of the compact manifold geometry .",
    "this , as already stressed , we plan to do in the immediate future .",
    "it is at the same time quite interesting to consider the interplay between the tits satake projection and the gauging of supergravity models which is also on agenda .",
    "as we have illustrated in this paper we can easily obtain smooth realizations of the cosmic billiard with several bounces . the number of these bounces , however , is finite , as long as we deal with finite algebras , namely as long as we discuss higher dimensional configurations from a @xmath3 perspective .",
    "this is so because bounces are created , as we have shown , by compact group rotations along different generators and there is a finite number of them if the number of roots is finite .",
    "in order to see infinite bounces and may be chaos we have to have infinitely many roots , namely we have to look at higher dimensional supergravity from a @xmath6 or @xmath45 perspective .",
    "this requires to consider the affine or hyperbolic ka  moody extensions which we have addressed in the recent paper @xcite . yet , as touched upon there and readdressed in the present example here , the tits satake projection commutes with the affine extension and in general with dimensional reduction , which preserves the structure of the paint group @xmath0 .",

    "<S> the derivation of smooth cosmic billiard solutions by means of the compensator method , introduced by us sometimes ago , is extended to the case of supergravity with non maximal supersymmetry . here a new key feature is provided by the non - maximal split nature of the scalar coset manifold . to deal with this </S>",
    "<S> , one has to consider the theory of tits satake projections leading to maximal split projected algebras , where the compensator method can be successfully applied and interesting solutions that display several smooth bounces can be derived . the generic bouncing feature of all exact solutions can thus be checked . from the analysis of the tits satake projection emerges a regular scheme applicable to all non maximal supergravity models and in particular a challenging so far unobserved structure , that of the paint group @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter , which is preserved through dimensional reduction , provides a powerful tool to codify solutions of the exact supergravity theories in terms of solutions of their tits satake projected partners , which are much simpler and manageable . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the dynamical walls on which the cosmic ball bounces come actually in _ painted copies _ rotated into each other by the paint group . </S>",
    "<S> so the effective cosmic dynamics is that dictated by the maximal split tits satake manifold _ plus paint_. in the present paper we work out in all minor details the example provided by @xmath1 supergravity , whose scalar manifold is the special khlerian @xmath2 c - mapping in @xmath3 to the quaternionic @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice was not random . </S>",
    "<S> it is the next one after maximal supergravity and at the same time can be reinterpreted in the context of @xmath5 supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> we plan indeed , in a future publication , to apply the results we obtained here , to the discussion of the tits satake projection within the context of generic special khler manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on the merging of the tits - satake projection with the affine ka  </S>",
