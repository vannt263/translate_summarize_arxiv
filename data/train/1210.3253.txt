    "one dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic spin chains have attracted a lot of attention in the last decades , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a strong quantum character of these systems implies that they can show many fascinating phenomena , not existing in systems of higher dimension .",
    "also , many magnetic properties can be exactly calculated , owing to their low dimensionality .",
    "more recently , magnetic field effects have been particularly focused on , since the application of a magnetic field can bring new behaviors , such as magnetization plateaus , bose - einstein condensation , or novel field - induced magnetic orderings.@xcite such novel phenomena were indeed observed respectively in _",
    "e.g. _ the following systems of weakly - coupled spin chains : azurite containing distorted diamond spin-1/2 chains,@xcite cu(no@xmath2)@xmath32.5h@xmath0o containing alternating spin-1/2 chains,@xcite and @xmath4 , commonly abbreviated ndmap , containing anisotropic haldane spin-1 chains.@xcite a great deal of experimental work has been performed on spin-1/2 and spin-1 quantum 1d systems , but very little on systems of higher spin .",
    "the quasi-1d spin-3/2 screw chain antiferromagnet baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 is particularly interesting since it possesses a strong anisotropy , some sizable frustration , and , in spite of a larger spin , strong quantum effects .",
    "namely , the low - temperature magnetic state of the co@xmath5 ion ( @xmath6 ) in a distorted octahedral environment , as it is the case in this compound , is described by a highly anisotropic effective spin @xmath7.@xcite as a result , quantum fluctuations play an important role in this compound .    in zero magnetic field , baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits upon cooling a transition from a 1d magnetic behavior to a 3d antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath8  k , as first evidenced by he _",
    "et al._@xcite from magnetic and specific heat measurements .",
    "this system also presents a strong magnetic anisotropy , as shown from a twice larger susceptibility when the field is applied along the @xmath9axis ( chain direction ) , as compared to the one in a field applied perpendicular to the @xmath9axis.@xcite all these results indicate that the chain @xmath9axis is the magnetic easy axis in this compound . from magnetization measurements performed in a field applied along the @xmath9axis ,",
    "a field - induced order - to - disorder transition occurring above 1.8  k ( critical field @xmath10  t at 1.8  k ) , instead of a spin - flop transition , was then evidenced,@xcite before the saturation is reached at @xmath11  t.@xcite kimura _",
    "et al._@xcite attributed this order - to - disorder transition to the quantum phase transition characteristic of the @xmath7 1d xxz antiferromagnet with ising - like anisotropy model , whose hamiltonian is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) denotes the @xmath15-th component of the spin residing at the site @xmath16 of the chain , @xmath17 is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction along the chain , @xmath18 is the bohr magneton , @xmath19 is the longitudinal applied magnetic field ( @xmath20axis ) , @xmath21 is the electron @xmath21-factor along the @xmath9axis , and @xmath22 is an anisotropic parameter ( @xmath23 for the ising - like case ) .",

    "alternatively , the transverse component of the correlation function can be said to decay with the exponent @xmath40 , while the longitudinal component decays with the exponent @xmath41 .",
    "relation  ( [ fermiwavevector ] ) implies that the value of @xmath36 can be tuned by the applied magnetic field @xmath19 , through @xmath33 .",
    "the longitudinal correlation function is thus incommensurate with the chain , while the transverse correlation function always appears at the wave number @xmath42 , so that it is staggered .    when spin chains are weakly coupled , a long - range order of the spins sets in at low enough temperature . for the isotropic heisenberg case ( @xmath43 ) , the relation @xmath44 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath45 ) is always satisfied in the presence of a magnetic field , and thus the transverse fluctuation of eq .",
    "( [ transverse ] ) is dominant , implying a long - range ordering of the @xmath46 spin components ( nel order ) .",
    "however , for the ising - like case , the relation @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) holds above @xmath49 in the low field region of the gapless phase indicating a dominance of the longitudinal incommensurate correlation [ see eq .",
    "( [ longitudinal ] ) ] , before @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) becomes satisfied at higher field : an inversion of the tll exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 occurs at some critical field @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , a long - range ordered phase with a longitudinal incommensurate structure is predicted theoretically between @xmath49 and @xmath52 before the establishment of a transverse staggered ordered phase at @xmath53 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ longitudinal ] ) , the magnetic structure propagation vector of the longitudinal incommensurate order is expected to be : @xmath54 as @xmath33 varies with the field , the propagation vector follows this variation .",

    "the nmr observations in this new phase were explained involving a new type of order ( named ferromagnetic sdw in their work ) , where the chains with lsdw are ferromagnetically coupled both along the @xmath239axis and along the @xmath240axis , with a long - wavelength amplitude modulation in the @xmath252 plane .",
    "@xcite describing the interchain exchange couplings , the authors were able to develop a model that reproduces both the lsdw ( named columnar sdw in their work ) and ferromagnetic sdw orders .",
    "following these nmr observations and their interpretation , the ferromagnetic sdw phase was searched in our last neutron diffraction experiment at @xmath234  t and @xmath185  mk , by scanning the reciprocal lattice around positions compatible with this phase .",
    "unfortunately , no signal was observed and additional measurements are thus needed .",
    "the field - induced magnetic properties of the ising - like spin chain system baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 have been studied in detail by means of single - crystal neutron diffraction .",
    "our study was performed with a careful analysis of the magnetic domains distribution , allowing a full determination of the magnetic arrangements in both the nel and lsdw phases , at @xmath68 and 4.2  t , respectively .",
    "the determination of the magnetic structure in the incommensurate phase at 4.2 t is the first direct evidence of this predicted lsdw ordering in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the field - induced transitions from the nel to the paramagnetic phase and to the lsdw phase at lower temperature were studied by following the positions and intensities of chosen magnetic reflections up to 12  t and down to 50  mk .",
    "the phase boundary was found to be first - order for the nel - lsdw transition and second - order for the nel - paramagnetic transition , where critical exponents could be extracted from the field and temperature scans , confirming that baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 belongs to the 3d ising universality class .",
    "a complete investigation of the @xmath19-@xmath65 phase diagram as well as the field - dependence of the magnetic propagation vector was performed and found to compare perfectly to the tll predictions up to 8.75  t. a departure from the prediction is observed above 8.75  t where the lsdw magnetic satellites disappear .",
    "this is well below the expected transition to the transverse staggered long - range order , a discrepancy already pointed out by nmr studies and calling for further investigations .",
