    "colloidal particles , trapped at fluid interfaces by adsorption energies much larger than the thermal energy , can form effectively two - dimensional colloidal monolayers @xcite . during the last two decades",
    "these systems have received significant attention both in basic research as well as in applied sciences .",
    "on one hand , these monolayers serve as model systems for studying effective interactions , phase behaviors , structures , and the dynamics of condensed matter in reduced dimensionality @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "self - assembled colloidal monolayers find applications in optical devices , molecular electronics , emulsion stabilization processes , and as templates in the fabrication of new micro- and nanostructured materials .",
    "therefore , a reliable description of the lateral inter - particle interaction at all distances @xmath0 , which governs the structure formation of colloids at fluid interfaces , is of primary importance .    in his pioneering work pieranski @xcite",
    "showed that the electrostatic _ repulsion _ of charged colloids at such interfaces is dominated by a long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction , due to an asymmetric counterion distribution in the two adjacent media , in addition to the screened coulomb interaction also present in bulk systems . later both the power - law and the exponential contributions",
    "have been calculated within the framework of linearized poisson - boltzmann theory assuming point - like particles @xcite .",
    "it turned out that , whereas the interaction energy for charged particles always decays asymptotically @xmath1 , the prefactor depends on whether the interaction originates from charges on the polar @xcite or on the apolar @xcite side of the fluid interface .",
    "in addition there are experimental indications of an _ attractive _ long - ranged lateral interaction which can not be interpreted in terms of a van der waals force @xcite .",
    "attempts were made to explain it in terms of a deformation - induced capillary interaction , but a complete and final picture has not yet been reached @xcite . here , we focus on the electrostatic contribution to the interaction .    whereas pieranski s work has been extended in numerous directions , almost all subsequent studies",
    "have discussed exclusively the case of colloidal particles being far away from each other . in this asymptotic limit",
    "the superposition approximation has been assumed to be reliable , according to which one approximates the actual electrostatic potential ( or interfacial deformation ) for a pair of particles by the sum of the potentials ( or deformations ) of the two single particles .",
    "however , for a dense system or during aggregation , particles can come close to each other such that this superposition approximation is no longer justified .",
    "for the deformation induced attractive part of the interaction , the validity of this approximation has been discussed for both large @xcite and small @xcite separations .",
    "but so far for the repulsive electrostatic interaction no investigations of small - distance deviations from the superposition approximation have been reported , although a systematic multipole expansion of the electrostatic potential around a single inhomogeneously charged particle trapped at an interface is available @xcite .    here",
    ", we assess the quality of the superposition approximation for the electrostatic interaction between two colloidal particles floating close to each other at an electrolyte interface by considering a simplified problem ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) which offers the possibility to obtain exact analytic expressions .",
    "accordingly , first , the interface is assumed to be planar , i.e. , no deformations of the fluid interface are considered , which are typically of the order of nanometers for micron - sized particles @xcite .",
    "second , due to the small particle - particle distances to be studied , the curvature of the colloidal particles is ignored in the spirit of a derjaguin approximation @xcite by considering the effective interaction between two charged , planar , and parallel walls .",
    "third , a liquid - particle contact angle of @xmath2 is assumed ; this value is encountered for actual systems @xcite .",
    "we have derived an exact analytic expression for the electrostatic potential of this model within linearized poisson - boltzmann theory , which is then used to calculate the surface interaction energies per total surface area and the line interaction energy per total length of the two three - phase contact lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",

    "consider a three - dimensional cartesian coordinate system such that the two charged planar walls , which mimic the colloidal particles , are located at @xmath9 and the fluid interface is at @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "the electrolyte solution present at @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is denoted as medium `` 1 '' ( `` 2 '' ) . for simplicity here we consider binary monovalent electrolytes only , i.e. , there are only two ionic species of opposite sign like @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "generically the ions and the molecules are coupled such that the molecular and ion number densities vary on the scale of the bulk correlation length which is much smaller than the debye length which sets the length scale for the variation of the charge density @xcite .",
    "thus the number densities in both media vary only close to the walls or to the fluid interface at distances of the order of the bulk correlation length , which , away from critical points , is of the order of the size of the fluid molecules and of the ions and falls below the length scale to be considered here .",

    "the local charge density of the ions is _ not _ uniform in media `` 1 '' or `` 2 '' because this quantity varies on the scale of the debye lengths , which are typically much larger than molecular sizes . since the slab formed by the two walls at @xmath9 is a model of the space in between two colloidal particles trapped at the fluid interface , it is appropriate to describe the ions within a grand canonical ensemble , the reservoirs of which are given by the bulk electrolyte solutions far away from the fluid interface . within a simple density functional theory , which ( i ) considers uniform solvents in the upper and the lower half space , ( ii ) assumes low ionic strength in the bulk ( which facilitates the description of the ions as point - like particles ) , and ( iii ) describes deviations of the ion densities from the bulk ionic strengths only up to quadratic order , one derives the linearized poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation @xmath22 to be fulfilled by the electrostatic potential @xmath23 in medium @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions are : ( i ) the electrostatic potential should remain finite for @xmath25 , ( ii ) the electrostatic potential and the normal component of the electric displacement field at the fluid interface should be continuous , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and ( iii ) due to global charge neutrality the normal component of electric displacement field at the walls correspond to the surface charge densities , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to note that in our model the fluids are confined to the space between the two walls such that outside the fluid slab the electric field vanishes .    in order to determine the electrostatic potential we first split the whole problem into three sub - problems ( see appendix  [ app : a ] ) : ( i ) only the fluid interface is present in the absence of any walls , ( ii ) two charged walls with homogeneous surface charge densities @xmath10 and the uniform medium `` 1 '' in between , and ( iii ) two charged walls with homogeneous surface charge densities @xmath11 and the uniform medium `` 2 '' in between . by adding the solution of problem ( ii ) and the solution of problem ( i ) for the upper half - space and by adding the solution of problem ( iii ) and the solution of problem ( i ) for the lower half - space , one obtains potentials in the two media which satisfy all the boundary conditions listed above except the continuity of the potential at the interface . in order to fulfill also the latter one , we construct a correction function which ( i ) is a solution of the linearized pb equation , ( ii ) keeps all boundary conditions unchanged which are already satisfied , and ( iii ) leads to continuity of the potential at the interface .",
