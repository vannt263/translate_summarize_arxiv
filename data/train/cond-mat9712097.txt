    "this extensive study of the sound produced in single bubble cavitation is prompted by the recent interest in sonoluminescence ( sl ) , i.e. the conversion of externally applied sound in a liquid into light @xcite .",
    "it has been generally accepted that the sl light emission is intimately connected to the dynamics of the gas - liquid interface , though the specific mechanism producing the light flashes has not been uniquely identified .",
    "we present here a nonperturbative study of the sound radiated from the subsonically moving phase boundary between the gas bubble and the liquid in which it is immersed . in our approach",
    "we rely on the standard treatise of the subject @xcite . apart from the importance of sound emission as the primary damping mechanism under the extreme conditions of sonoluminescence",
    ", the sound signal can be used as another diagnostic tool to study the bubble dynamics . for detailed accounts of related previous theoretical studies of the cavitation sound",
    "see refs.@xcite , including references to earlier work .",
    "we proceed here in two distinct steps :    * to begin with , the motion of the gas - liquid phase boundary is assumed to be given and we determine the resulting sound field . *",
    "secondly , we consider the feedback effect of the radiated sound field onto the phase boundary dynamics , i.e. we describe the motion of the bubble selfconsistently .",
    "the ( multi-)bubble cavitation has been studied intensely for some time , because of important applications and interesting underlying fluid dynamics @xcite . the discovery of well controlled experimental conditions by gaitan and crum @xcite permitting the study of a single gas bubble over long periods of time , together with the ability to drive it externally by acoustic waves , has focused the experimental interest on the single bubble sonoluminescence ( sbsl ) phenomenon .",
    "the remarkable finding here is that light is produced in very short pulses @xcite : a million photons of several ev energy are emitted within 50ps by apparently about @xmath0 atoms / molecules from a gas bubble of sub-@xmath1 m radius .",
    "the standard theoretical tool in the study of the bubble surface dynamics is the rayleigh - plesset ( rp ) equation , representing the motion of the gas - liquid interface by the time dependent ( spherical ) bubble radius @xmath2 .",
    "several mechanisms which damp the collective motion of the bubble - liquid system have been incorporated in modern approaches : viscosity of the liquid and sound damping @xcite .",
    "effects of the ` rectified ' mass diffusion @xcite and heat conductivity , see e.g. ref.@xcite , play also an important role in establishing the parameter regime for stationary sbsl , but will not be further discussed here . in the sbsl cycle",
    "the sound emission produced during the violent bubble collapse turns out to be the most important energy loss mechanism @xcite .",
    "less than half of the energy in the bubble is dissipated by the viscous friction .",
    "only a comparatively tiny fraction of the energy delivered to the bubble by the external sound wave is radiated in form of the visible light @xcite .",
    "we will use the linear acoustic approximation ( see section 2.1 ) , which describes the subsonic propagation of density perturbations in a fluid neglecting the effects of sound wave dispersion and absorption @xcite .",
    "this approximation does not allow us to study situations involving shock wave formation in the liquid .",
    "in section 2.2 we solve the sound wave equation for the velocity potential exactly for any given @xmath2 .",
    "our derivation is formally exact provided the assumptions of non - dissipative fluid dynamics are valid .",
    "our expressions account in full for retardation and allow an arbitrary incoming sound field .",
    "the key result is the exact form of the pressure amplitude radiated from the moving bubble surface into the surrounding liquid , see eq.([pressure ] ) . in order to compare with earlier analytical and numerical work we also derive in section 2.3 the perturbative expansion of our general results in powers of @xmath3 , i.e. bubble wall velocity divided by liquid sound velocity .    in the subsequent section 3",
    "we describe a model of the bubble interior which is motivated by the approximately homologous dynamics observed in numerical hydrodynamic simulations @xcite : the gas density distribution and velocity field have been found to show a simple scaling behavior , in terms of the scaled radius variable @xmath4 and with @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these numerical results have recently motivated development of a semianalytic approach for the coupled bubble - liquid system , based on a lagrangian variational principle @xcite , of which a simpler variant will be used here . this allows to assess the order of magnitude of the feedback effects of the bubble interior dynamics .    with this preparation",
    "we can proceed to the second step indicated above in section 4 , i.e. the derivation of a selfconsistent bubble equation of motion .",
    "there exists already a variety of equations generalizing the rayleigh - plesset equation , see e.g. @xcite , and more recent ones which consider the case of the externally driven damped nonlinear bubble oscillations in the sbsl parameter regime @xcite . in our selfconsistent approach ( section 4.1 ) we make extensive use of the results obtained in section 2 .",
    "we incorporate the external sound field in section 4.2 according to standard experimental conditions realized to date . in section 4.3",
    "we derive a nonperturbative equation , eq.([reqgen3 ] ) , which is formally valid to all orders in @xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) , however , subject to the linear acoustic approximation scheme .",
    "we incorporate the bubble interior using the vanderwaals equation of state and allow also for a realistic equation of state ( eos ) of the liquid .",
    "our derivations are based on the navier - stokes equation and , thus , take the effects of the liquid and gas viscosities consistently into account .",
    "we illustrate our formal results in section 5 by studying numerically the properties of an air bubble in water externally driven by an ultrasound field with system parameters in the typical sbsl regime @xcite .",
    "we show in detail there that the various ( nonperturbative ) corrections incorporated in the bubble equation of motion generally result in sizeable corrections of the maximal bubble surface velocity during the collapse .",
    "they tend to make the bubble collapse less violent than seen in previous perturbative descriptions . in section 5.3",
    "we compute the outgoing compression wave emitted from the bubble surface into the surrounding liquid and consider the validity of the acoustic approximation .",
    "we present final remarks and conclusions accompanied by a brief summary of our work in section 6 .",
    "we reexamine here the sound radiation originating from a moving phase boundary between two non - viscous fluids , separated by an idealized wall of vanishing thickness .",
    "references to earlier work on this subject are surveyed in refs.@xcite .",
    "related issues were studied recently in refs.@xcite . in distinction to these approaches ,",
    "we derive exact expressions for the sound field emitted from a spherical boundary undergoing arbitrary motion .",
    "we begin in the next subsection by recapitulating some aspects of nonviscous hydrodynamics which lead to the ( acoustic ) approximation scheme used here in describing the sound generation and propagation .",
    "the linear acoustic approximation is based on the assumption that the sound field causes only small perturbations of the ambient state of the fluid characterized by a vanishing velocity field and constant density and pressure ref.@xcite .",
    "thus we shall not consider here nonlinear phenomena , such as the dispersion and absorption of sound waves in the medium and , in particular , the formation of supersonic shock waves .",
    "we shall see quantitatively in section 5 that this scheme is fairly well satisfied , though the amplitude of the generated sound field typically reaches up to @xmath7atm near to a sbsl bubble .",
    "the basic equations of nonviscous hydrodynamics are :    1 .   the continuity equation for the fluid density @xmath8 , which assures the conservation of mass : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the local fluid velocity .",
    "the euler equation , arising from newton s equation of motion for a small fluid cell : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the local pressure in the nonviscous fluid and the comoving derivative is defined by @xmath13 .",
    "later we will consider the navier - stokes generalization for viscous flow , see eq.([navierstokes ] ) .",
    "3 .   in the absence of entropy production",
    "the set of equations is closed by the eos relating the pressure to the density .",
    "for example , the ideal gas eos is : @xmath14=k\\rho^\\gamma \\;\\;,\\quad \\gamma\\equiv c_p / c_v \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where the adiabatic index @xmath15 denotes the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure and volume , respectively .",
    "had we allowed that the sound waves disturb the medium and generate entropy , we would require an eos with two variables , e.g relating the pressure to the mass and energy densities . in this case",
    "we would have to introduce additionally the energy conservation in differential form , in order to close the set of equations .    in the following we study small - amplitude , acoustic perturbations of an ambient state of the fluid ( liquid , gas ) characterized by the ambient solutions to eqs.([continuity])([eos ] ) , @xmath16 . in order to obtain equations governing the perturbations @xmath17 ,",
    "we set : @xmath18 inserting these expressions into eqs.([continuity])([eos ] ) , a coupled set of equations results which relates various powers of the perturbations .",
    "the description of perturbations can be further simplified by assuming a particularly simple ambient state : @xmath19 i.e. a homogeneous state independent of time ( quiescent state ) .",
    "then , the equations linearized in the perturbations become : @xmath20 \\label{euler1 }   & \\;&\\rho_0\\partial_t\\vec{v}^{\\;*}=-\\nabla p^ * \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 2ex ]   \\label{eos1 } & \\;&p^*=\\gamma k\\rho_0^{\\gamma -1}\\rho^*=c^2\\rho^*\\;\\ ; , \\quad c^2\\equiv\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial\\rho } \\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we made use of a taylor expansion in order to obtain eq.([eos1 ] ) and introduced the ( constant ) sound velocity @xmath21 for the ambient fluid state . combining eqs.([continuity1])([eos1 ] ) , we obtain the well known wave equations : @xmath22    next , we introduce the velocity potential @xmath23 .",
    "consider the curl of eq.([euler1 ] ) : @xmath24 i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "thus , if the vorticity of the velocity field perturbation @xmath26 vanishes initially , then it remains zero always .",
    "in this case we can write : @xmath27 where the relation between the velocity potential and the pressure perturbation is chosen such that the linearized euler equation , eq.([euler1 ] ) , is automatically satisfied .",
    "inserting the eos , eq.([eos1 ] ) , in the linearized continuity equation , eq.([continuity1 ] ) , and using eq.([potential ] ) , one obtains the wave equation for the velocity potential : @xmath28 for simplicity , we suppress from now on the index @xmath29 introduced in eq.([perturb ] ) .      assuming spherical symmetry and using spherical coordinates , the velocity potential is seen to satisfy the usual scalar spherical wave equation : @xmath30 the generic solutions ( regular at infinity ) are out- and ingoing spherical waves : @xmath31 for the spherically symmetric bubble wall located at the position @xmath32 the boundary condition is : @xmath33 where we introduced the notation @xmath34 . in general , the solution of the wave equation , eq.([sphwavesol ] ) , will be composed of a linear superposition of in- and outgoing spherical waves .",
    "we shall allow for the possibility of an incoming acoustical wave , @xmath35 , e.g. as part of the external driving sound field , and rewrite eq.([boundary ] ) in more detail : @xmath36 where @xmath37 has been substituted by an outgoing spherical wave , cf .",
    "eqs.([sphwavesol ] ) ; henceforth we use the abbreviation @xmath38 .",
    "the external field @xmath35 is kept arbitrary in the derivations to follow , but will be incorporated according to a physically relevant example in section 4.2 .    in principle , there will be also a sound field generated by the moving phase boundary which will travel into the interior , to be reflected at the center of the bubble ( @xmath39 ) , and then return . its description , i.e. pertaining to the bubble interior , requires a suitable modification of the present approach , see section 3 .    with @xmath40 given by other dynamics ,",
    "our objective now is to determine implicitly the outgoing velocity potential @xmath37 . for this purpose we recast eq.([boundary1 ] ) into the form of an ordinary linear first - order differential equation with known time dependent coefficients : @xmath41 where we used of the following substitutions and simple relations : @xmath42   \\label{fprime }   & \\;&f'(t - r / c)=\\frac{df}{dt_-}\\frac{dt_-}{dt } \\frac{1}{\\dot t_- } = \\frac{\\dot f(t_-)}{1-\\dot r / c }   \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 2ex ] \\label{f }   & \\;&f(t)\\equiv f(t_-(t))\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\ ;      \\dot f(t)=\\dot f(t_-(t ) )   \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([boundary2 ] ) we note the retardation factor originating in eq.([fprime ] ) .",
    "the general solution of eq.([boundary2 ] ) is elementary : @xmath43 \\label{boundary2sol }   & \\;&-r(t)\\int_{t_0}^t{d}t''[c-\\dot r(t'')]\\dot { \\cal r}(t '' ) \\,\\mbox{\\large e}^{-\\int_{t''}^t{d}t'\\frac{c}{r(t ' ) } } \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the integration constant .",
    "it is fixed by the requirement that no outgoing wave should be excited before the bubble wall is set into motion at @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , with @xmath46 , we find @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting constraint @xmath48 is most conveniently implemented by a step function factor @xmath49 .    using eqs.([sphwavesol]),([f ] ) , we can recover from the above solution the outgoing velocity potential . to do this",
    "we will need the inverse function @xmath50 of @xmath51 , eq.([tretard ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 is a single - valued function , if and only if @xmath53 is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing with time . for subsonic bubble wall motion @xmath51 is strictly increasing , since @xmath54 , and @xmath52 is strictly increasing in this case .",
    "this allows us to perform variable substitution at will and we obtain : @xmath55\\dot{\\cal r}(t'')\\ , \\mbox{\\large e}^{-\\int_{t''}^{s }         dt'\\frac{c}{r(t')}}\\;\\;,\\\\ \\label{defs } s&\\equiv&\\tilde t(t - r / c)=t-\\frac{r - r(s)}{c}\\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the retardation effect seen here can be evaluated more explicitly . for example : @xmath56   \\label{ttilde2 }    \\tilde{t}(t - r / c)&\\approx&t-\\frac{r - r(t)}{c }   \\;\\;,\\;\\;\\;r\\stackrel{>}{\\approx}r(t )   \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to calculate the velocity and pressure fields , we require the derivative of @xmath57 : @xmath58 then , differentiating eq.([phioutexp ] ) , we obtain ( @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 \\nonumber \\\\ [ 2ex ] \\label{velocity }   & = & \\left\\{\\frac{r\\dot { \\cal r}}{r}+(\\frac{1}{r}- \\frac{1}{r})\\frac{f}{r } \\right\\}_{\\tilde{t}(t- r / c)}+\\partial_r\\phi_{in}(r , t )   \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 4ex ] p(r , t)&=&-\\rho_l\\partial_t[\\phi_{out}(r , t)+\\phi_{in}(r , t ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ [ 2ex ] \\label{pressure } % \\label{pexact } & = & \\frac{c\\rho_l}{r}\\left\\ { r\\dot { \\cal r } + \\frac{f}{r}\\right\\}_{\\tilde{t}(t - r / c ) }   -\\rho_0\\partial_t\\phi_{in}(r , t )   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all functions within the braces are to be evaluated at the indicated time - argument @xmath61 ; henceforth @xmath62 denotes the ambient density of the liquid .",
    "we recall that @xmath12 is the pressure perturbation due to the generated sound field , to be added to the ambient pressure .",
    "the results obtained for the velocity potential and the velocity and pressure fields , eqs.([boundary2sol])([pressure ] ) in section 2.2 , involve an integration over the history of the bubble wall motion .",
    "thus the corresponding nonlinear differential equation describing it selfconsistently ( section 4 ) could be expected to become nonlocal in time ( see , however , section 4.3 ) . in any case , for sufficiently slow motion a local approximation can be justified , see refs.@xcite and earlier references therein ; this approach leads to a popular generalization of the rp equation .",
    "therefore , our next objective is a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath3 of our general expressions , in particular of the velocity potential , eq.([phioutexp ] ) .",
    "let us consider an integral of the form ( in our case @xmath63 : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , cf .",

    "in section 4 we want to derive the equation of motion of the phase boundary ( bubble surface ) self - consistently . for this purpose",
    "we need to understand the dynamics of the interior of the bubble . in distinction",
    "to section 2 , presently we have to take into account that the density , pressure , and velocity fields inside the bubble may change by several orders of magnitude during different phases of the ( periodic ) bubble motion .",
    "therefore , a linearization of the hydrodynamic equations of motion around a homogeneous and time independent ambient state , as performed in section 2.1 , is not applicable here .    in the hydrodynamic studies of the interior motion",
    "the emphasis has been to understand the development of the extreme conditions inside the bubble @xcite .",
    "chu noted that for an important part of the sbsl cycle the bubble motion is ( nearly ) homologous , i.e. the shape of the density distribution and the velocity field of the gas scale in an appropriate way with the radius @xmath83 and surface velocity @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations in the sbsl parameter regime indicate a homologous contraction ( and its stability ) until the onset of shock wave formation and independently of the details of the eos used .",
    "this stability of the homologous motion may be related to the fact that only for the homologous motion there is no energy loss due to viscosity inside the bubble ( see eq.([viscinside ] ) and below ) .",
    "we solve the continuity and euler equations , eqs.([continuity ] ) and ( [ euler ] ) of section 2.1 respectively , by approximating the density and velocity fields with suitable scaling functions .",
    "we neglect dissipative effects in the bubble , such as viscosity , heat conduction , and radiation transfer especially . presently , we are interested in a semiquantitative analysis of the bubble interior .",
    "this seems sufficient for our later derivation of the overall bubble dynamics : the motion is largely determined by the dynamics of the fluid , since only a minor fraction of the relevant total energy resides in the interior at any time . for a detailed understanding of the microscopic processes leading to sonoluminescence inside the bubble ,",
    "however , the dissipative effects will be essential ingredients .",
    "it turns out , see refs.@xcite , that for a time independent shape of a properly scaling density distribution the velocity potential is : @xmath85 in terms of the bubble radius @xmath2 , which yields : @xmath86 i.e. a linear radial velocity profile . the continuity equation , eq.([continuity ] ) , takes the form : @xmath87 where we introduced the homologous ansatz : @xmath88 with @xmath4 denoting the scaling variable . here",

    "we refer the reader to refs.@xcite for the variational improvement of the strictly homologous dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) which we will pursue here , with a time independent yet scaling density profile function .    in order to determine the scaling function @xmath94",

    "we integrated numerically the nonperturbative eq.([reqgen3 ] ) for a homologous bubble , in which case @xmath272 according to eq.([i ] ) .",
    "however , the gas pressure entering through eq.([hl ] ) is evaluated here for a homogeneous bubble for the moment ; we shall consider the effect of the inhomogeneity in section 5.3 .",
    "we note that on the scale of fig.1 , the @xmath2 curves calculated with the other equations derived in this work or the one used before in refs.@xcite , for example , can not be discriminated for our typical parameter set .",
    "therefore , we will in the following pay more attention to @xmath270 , which is much more sensitive to the differences between the various equations of motion .",
    "the equations of motion which have been used to study driven gas bubbles in liquids in the sbsl parameter regime incorporated effects of the sound emission only in the lowest order in @xmath273 so far , see e.g. refs.@xcite and further references therein . in view of the high velocities of the bubble surface reached during the collapse phase , which may reach @xmath274 ( @xmath275 ) ,",
    "as indicated in fig.1 , we study here how the various approximate treatments of sound damping compare to the nonperturbative eq.([reqgen3 ] ) .",
    "the bubble interior is treated here as explained in the context of fig.1 above .",
    "the individual sections in fig.2 show the surface velocity @xmath270 at the first bounce ( left column ) and the second bounce ( second column ) for different amplitudes of the driving pressure ( top to bottom ; @xmath276 in units of @xmath101 ) ; the origin of the time - axis is arbitrarily chosen for the first bounce , the delay until the corresponding one for the second bounce is indicated in each case .",
    "the results are obtained from the nonperturbative equation ( full line ) , and its lowest order in @xmath3 perturbative expansion ( dashed line ) , cf .",
    "eq.([reqgenperturb ] ) , respectively . in the latter case",
    "also the retardation shifting the time argument of the driving pressure term , see eq.([ddg ] ) , has been neglected , in conformity with earlier work .",
    "it is obvious from fig.2 that characteristic phase shifts result w.r.t . to the cycle timing set by the external driving pressure and between the first and subsequent bounce(s ) .",
    "physically most important is the fact that within the perturbative treatment the maximal surface velocity during the collapse is overestimated by a considerable amount , e.g. @xmath277 for the first bounce at @xmath269 .",
    "this implies that the collapse is significantly less violent than has been concluded from previous theoretical treatments of the bubble dynamics . in particular , quantitative sbsl estimates derived from models which couple the perturbatively corrected rayleigh - plesset equation , cf .",
    "eq.([reqfinal ] ) , to a full hydrodynamic simulation of the bubble interior may need a revision @xcite .",
    "we are led to this conclusion also from the various other corrections to be discussed shortly .",
    "the origin of the retardation of the first bounce in the perturbative approach is shown in fig.3 to be due to the neglect in the perturbative expansion of the time retardation effect . when the retardation is included as in eq.([ddg ] ) , then the positions of the first perturbative and nonperturbative bounce coincide",
    ". however , the perturbative expansion including the retardation effect continues to introduce an overestimate of the collapse velocity .",
    "this is leading to a remaining phase shift of 15 - 20 ns between first and subsequent bounce(s ) , as seen in the bottom portion of fig.3 .      in order to demonstrate the influence of the behavior of the bubble interior on the overall dynamics of the coupled bubble - liquid system , beyond just providing the pressure resisting the collapse",
    ", we consider here how the homologous bubble description developed in section 3 compares with the usual simpler homogeneous matter distribution model of the bubble interior .",
    "we exploit here the presence of a fixed point @xmath278 , eq.([rhostar ] ) , where the density remains nearly constant .",
    "presence of this fixed point can not be expected in general , however , we presently make this assumption based on our numerical experience with the description of homologous and adiabatic changes of the interior distributions .",
    "we can evaluate eq.([eulerint1 ] ) conveniently integrating from @xmath279 to @xmath83 . with @xmath280 , see eq.([eosw ] ) , which denotes the gas pressure of the corresponding homogeneous bubble , we obtain the following approximate result for the homologous gas pressure at the bubble surface : @xmath281    employing this expression for the gas pressure in the nonperturbative equation of motion ( [ reqgen3 ] ) , we find the results depicted in fig.4 ( full line ) , where also the behavior of a homogeneous bubble ( dashed line ) is shown for comparison . we observe only a rather small effect on @xmath2 , except for a 1.5ns shift of the minimum .",
    "however , similarly to the effects illustrated in fig.2 , we find here another sizeable reduction of the maximal collapse speed ( @xmath282 ) .",
    "the maximum of the gas pressure at the homologous bubble surface is reduced by about 5% , as compared to the homogeneous one , which amounts to @xmath283atm . however , the maximal gas density at the surface is much less affected and reaches approximately one half liquid density in our calculational example .      as a further application of our study of the sound field imposed on and rescattered by a typical sbsl bubble",
    "we evaluate it at a given distance away from the bubble , where it can be measured by a hydrophone , which preferably should be sensitive to the highest expected sound frequencies @xcite .",
    "perturbatively , it is most convenient to obtain the sound pressure using eq.([pressure ] ) or ( [ pressureout ] ) in the form : @xmath284 where @xmath285 and @xmath57 can be further evaluated with the help of eq.([ttilde1 ] ) or eq.([ttilde2 ] ) , whichever applies .",
    "the pressure difference on the r.h.s .",
    "here can then be computed easily from the solution of the perturbative equation of motion ( [ reqfinal ] ) , cf .",
    "section 5.1 , since it is implicitly part of it .",
    "the result at the lowest nontrivial order in @xmath3 is shown in fig.5 , for @xmath286 mm away from the center of the bubble .",
    "we clearly see the outgoing compression spikes riding on the sinusoidal driving pressure , which are caused by the bubble collapse and successive bounces . on the pressure scale of this figure ( cutting off the first maximum )",
    "the nonperturbative result would be indistinguishable from the perturbative calculation .",
    "we calculate the pressure field nonperturbatively beginning with eq.([pressureoutpert ] ) , as before .",
    "however , we proceed in this case by using the pressure boundary condition , eq.([stressboundarygen ] ) , in order to calculate @xmath287 .",
    "the term @xmath288 , in particular , can be evaluated in the long - wavelength limit ( neglecting a cross term between viscosity and compressibility ) to yield @xmath289 , while all other terms are straightforward to obtain from the numerical solution of the nonperturbative eq.([reqgen3 ] ) ; cf .",
    "the remarks explaining the calculation of fig.1 in section 5.1 .    in fig.6",
    "we show the nonperturbative evaluation of the first sound pressure spike at @xmath286 mm . for comparison , also",
    "the somewhat earlier and considerably stronger spike given by the perturbative calculation , cf .",
    "fig.5 , is shown .",
    "if we correct the calculated amplitude here for the geometric dispersion , then the pressure at @xmath290 m reaches @xmath291atm at maximum .",
    "applying the generic damping factor of @xmath292 for the absorption of a ( 300mhz ) pulse travelling 1 mm , we arrive approximately at the pressure amplitude measured experimentally for an sbsl bubble under similar conditions as assumed in our calculation @xcite .",
    "however , another interesting aspect here is the rise time of the sound signal , i.e. from one - half to maximum amplitude , which takes only 40ps ( decay time 260ps ) .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude below what has been resolved in the above cited experiments .    finally , in view of the pressure spike results presented here",
    ", it seems worth while to check one of our basic assumptions , which is the linear acoustic approximation , section 2.1 .",
    "it is underlying the linear wave equation for the velocity potential , eq.([sphwave ] ) , which forms the basis of our study of the emitted sound field .",
    "whereas dispersion and absorption can be incorporated in a linearized approximation , genuinely nonlinear effects are beyond our present scope @xcite .",
    "the linear approximation requires that perturbations of the ambient state of the fluid are relatively small . employing the adiabatic liquid eos ( [ eosl ] ) for water and considering the maximum of the pressure amplitude obtained here ,",
    "see fig.6 , we obtain a maximal compression and ratio of sound speeds : @xmath293 respectively .",
    "whereas the compression may appear to be quite tolerable , the temporary increase of the sound speed and its implications for the damping of the bubble motion , when the sound pulse is launched from the collapsing bubble surface , obviously deserve further study .",
    "furthermore , one may wonder about the behavior of the water next to the bubble surface , when it is exposed to the `` cold shock '' indicated by our results , i.e. several @xmath7atm pressure increase within less than 50ps .",
    "the aim of our present work has been to reconsider the sound emission from the highly nonlinear , large amplitude motion of the interface between the gas inside and the liquid outside a cavitating bubble .",
    "previous studies typically evaluated the radiated sound field in lowest order of a perturbation expansion in @xmath3 , i.e. valid for slow bubble wall motion as compared to the sound velocity in the liquid . generally , it is believed that @xmath270 reaches up to ( or even exceeds ) the sound velocity for externally driven bubbles in the parameter regime where sonoluminescence is observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "this necessitates a nonperturbative treatment , such as ours , cf .",
    "section 2.2 and see eq.([pressure ] ) , in particular .",
    "we anticipate that the sound signal from a nonlinearly oscillating bubble wall may provide an important additional diagnostic tool .",
    "it should reflect the essential short - time scale(s ) of this motion , which vary over several orders of magnitude @xcite , with current technology limiting the resolution in the @xmath294 range , i.e. less than about 10ns .",
    "this may be particularly valuable in cases where light scattering methods @xcite do not truly reflect the motion of a sharply defined bubble wall or are not applicable at all , such as for liquid metals @xcite .",
    "we recall that based on section 3 we describe the bubble interior using homologous profile functions for the density and velocity distributions .",
    "these allow for a more realistic study of the dynamics and particular properties of the high compression phase of strongly driven bubble oscillations , the importance of which has been shown earlier @xcite .",
    "presently we employ only a simplified version of the semianalytic variational approach developed in refs.@xcite . in any case , our derivation of eq.([reqgen3 ] ) allows to incorporate easily any more precise model of the bubble interior ; and it may be possible to extend this approach in order to account for the important effects of heat conductivity and mass diffusion .    our numerical examples obtained in section 5 employ as another approximation the homologous solutions with the usual adiabatic vanderwaals eos .",
    "these eos become questionable when the energy density reaches the ionization regime .",
    "the dynamic behavior of the gas mixtures within a rapidly oscillating bubble , here assumed to remain that of a di - atomic gas ( air ) , deserves further study . in parallel to the cyclic in- and outgassing from the liquid into the bubble ( `` rectified diffusion '' ) , it remains to be seen whether an essential amount of liquid vaporizes at the bubble surface and recondenses during an oscillation cycle .",
    "related effects may help to explain the observed sensitivity of sonoluminescence to experimental parameters such as temperature in particular @xcite .",
    "in general , transport phenomena within the bubble and across the phase boundary have to be incorporated whenever the motion becomes fast compared to characteristic relaxation times @xmath295 , @xmath296 , where @xmath297 denotes the scale of a corresponding gradient ( e.g. mass density , partial pressure , temperature , etc . ) . in particular ,",
    "shock waves may be launched into the bubble interior @xcite or exterior @xcite , the description of which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "one may speculate whether or not the liquid ( water ) may be trapped in a metastable state w.r.t .",
    "solidification into a high - density phase ( of ice ) and in which form the corresponding binding energy would be released most efficiently .",
    "presumably it stays at or close to the ambient temperature @xcite .",
    "assuming an effective sound velocity of 2000 m/s , the 300ps mean half width of the pressure pulse obtained in section 5.3 corresponds to a spatial shell width of 0.6@xmath1 m , i.e. about the vanderwaals hard core radius employed in our calculations .",
    "near the collapsed state with @xmath298 m such a shell contains about @xmath299 water molecules , i.e. only about an order of magnitude more particles than assumed ( in the gas ) inside .",
    "furthermore , the sound pulse amplitude decreases exponentially away from the bubble surface ( besides geometric dispersion @xmath300 ) due to absorption in the liquid @xcite .",
    "then , assuming an extremely conservative decay @xmath301/.434)$ ] , one immediately estimates that the energy dissipated in this first shell ( proportional to square of amplitude decrease ) amounts to about 3/1000 of the pulse energy .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude times the energy emitted in the form of visible light by a sbsl bubble @xcite .",
    "the small spatio - temporal extension of the region where this energy has to be dissipated , and how , definitely deserves further study .",
    "this should provide an improved starting point for the exploration of essential aspects of the violent bubble collapse which may help to elucidate the nature of sonoluminescence .",
    "we hope to come back to one or the other of these fascinating aspects of sbsl bubbles which are especially related to their sound field in our future work .",
    "we note that while in principle the effect of a dynamic treatment of the bubble interior on the behavior of @xmath2 , which we introduced in section 5.2 and fig.4 , should be part of a full hydrodynamic simulation @xcite , the sound emission discussed in section 5.1 had not been treated properly in any of the approaches prior to our work . in view of the numerical results presented in section 5",
    "it is obvious that the nonperturbative treatment of the emitted sound field as proposed here , which accounts for about 50% of the damping of the driven bubble oscillations , is mandatory . in particular , the standard perturbative calculations tend to overestimate the maximally reached surface velocity during the collapse phase considerably .",
    "thus a crucial aspect of the `` preparation phase '' for the unknown light emission process can be described more accurately employing the nonperturbative equation of motion derived in section 4.3 , eq.([reqgen3 ] ) .",
    "this seems particularly relevant for detailed hydrodynamic studies of the bubble interior , in which the exterior has been described by the perturbative rayleigh - plesset equation before @xcite .",
    "our numerical results for the nonperturbative sound pulse emitted by an air bubble in water ( section 5.3 ) fit qualitatively the first experimental observations reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as we pointed out at the end of section 5.3 , they also indicate the limitation of our present derivations . whereas the bubble equation of motion , eq.([reqgen3 ] ) ,",
    "is derived from the intrinsically nonlinear navier - stokes equation , in the form of eq.([reqgen ] ) of section 4.3 , our considerations of the emitted sound field are based on the acoustic approximation ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "therefore , we still neglect important sound absorption and dispersion effects in the liquid . using the realistic eos for water , eq.([eosl ] ) in section 4.1",
    ", we indicated in eqs.([ratios ] ) the compression of the liquid and the corresponding increase in the density dependent sound velocity which are induced by the outgoing pressure spike next to the bubble surface .",
    "it seems desirable to study in the future the importance of nonlinear effects on the propagation and fate of the extremely strong sound pulse emitted .",
    "there are published results on full hydrodynamic simulations of the coupled bubble - liquid system , which include especially the exterior fluid @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , so far no attention has been paid to the unusual behavior of the liquid which may be caused by the pressure spike of @xmath302atm launched from the bubble surface , independently of whether there are shock waves generated in the bubble interior or not .",
    "we obtained such amplitudes in typical examples with generic sbsl parameters , where particularly their rise time of only about 40ps seems quite astounding , but also reminiscent of the shortness of the sbsl light pulses .",
