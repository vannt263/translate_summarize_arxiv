    "then we will do the same for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "let us first define the random matrix ensemble that we will consider in these lectures .",
    "the * gaussian unitary ensemble * ( gue ) of random matrices consists in @xmath1 hermitian matrices distributed according to @xmath2 where the reference measure @xmath3 is the product lebesgue measure over the ( not constrained by symmetry ) entries of the matrix @xmath4 , namely , and @xmath5 is the normalisation constant .",
    "the name gue derives from the fact that the measure ( [ eqgue ] ) is invariant over the unitary transformations and has a gaussian form .",
    "the gue measure has the nice ( and special ) property that , on top of being unitary - invariant , the entries of the matrices are independent .",
    "indeed , another way to define ( [ eqgue ] ) is to set the upper - triangular entries of the matrix @xmath4 to be independent and gaussian distributed with @xmath6 for , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , for @xmath9 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath10 in front of the trace in ( [ eqgue ] ) can be freely chosen : the only difference is a global scaling of the eigenvalues . with the choice in ( [ eqgue ] ) , the largest eigenvalue of a @xmath1 matrix has fluctuations of order @xmath11 around the deterministic value @xmath12 .",
    "also , the eigenvalues density remains of order @xmath13 in the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "another standard choice in random matrix literature consists in choosing the prefactor to be @xmath13 , then the eigenvalues are scaled down by a factor @xmath14 , i.e. , the fluctuations are of order @xmath15 around @xmath16 .",
    "this choice is natural since the law of the entries are independent of @xmath17 .",
    "finally , setting the prefactor to be @xmath17 , the largest eigenvalue fluctuates in a scale @xmath18 around @xmath19 .",
    "this choice is natural if one wants to study the support of the spectrum , that remains bounded in the @xmath20 limit .",
    "the unitary invariance of ( [ eqgue ] ) allows to compute explicitly the measure of the eigenvalues , because the measure ( [ eqgue ] ) written in terms of the eigenvalues and of the angular variables becomes a product measure .",
    "the result is the following .",
    "[ lemgueonept ] let @xmath21 denote the @xmath17 eigenvalues of a gue random matrix .",

    "the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue for gue were characterized by tracy and widom :    let us denote by @xmath24 the largest eigenvalue of a @xmath1 gue matrix .",
    "then , @xmath25 is a non - degenerate distribution function , called * gue tracy - widom distribution*. it can be characterized by the fredholm determinant @xmath26 with @xmath27 , the * airy kernel*. @xmath28 is the airy function , the solution of @xmath29 with @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",

    "the dynamics in continuous time is as follows .",
    "particles jump on the neighboring right site with rate @xmath13 provided that the site is empty .",
    "this means that jumps are independent of each other and take place after an exponential waiting time with mean @xmath13 , which is counted from the time instant when the right neighbor site is empty .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath57 a particle configuration , @xmath58 . let @xmath59 : @xmath60 be a function depending only on a finite number of @xmath61 s .",

    "the first proof of theorem  [ thmtasep ] goes back to  @xcite for the one - point and it was improved to a functional limit theorem in a discrete time setting in  @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "the result was for a last passage percolation .",
    "however , along the characteristics of the burgers equation , the decorrelation happens in a macroscopic scale ( one has to move away of order @xmath74 to see a fluctuation of order @xmath81 ) , in particular it is much slower than in the spatial direction ( where it is enough to move away of order @xmath82 ) .",
    "this is phenomenon is also known as * slow - decorrelation *  @xcite . using this fact one can deduce theorem  [ thmtasep ] for joint distributions from the last passage percolation result as shown in  @xcite .",
    "in these lectures we will address the question of the reason why the tracy - widom distribution and the airy@xmath0 process arises both in the gue model of random matrices and in tasep .",

    "denote by @xmath490 the @xmath73th smallest eigenvalue of the principal submatrix obtained from the first @xmath210 rows and columns of a gue matrix . in our context , these principal submatrices are usually referred to as minors , and not ( as otherwise customary ) their determinants .",
    "the result is well known : _ given the eigenvalues @xmath491 , @xmath264 , of the @xmath1 matrix _ , the gue minors eigenvalues are uniformly distributed on the set @xmath492 as shown in  @xcite .",
    "note that this is the continuous analogue of @xmath93 , see figure  [ figgueminors ] for an illustration .",

    "the natural question , in view of what we made with the interlacing particle system , is whether one can combine the two above special cases and get the correlation functions for space - like paths as above .",
    "there are two aspects to be considered .",
    "the first is to determine whether the evolution of the minors eigenvalues can be described by a markov process .",
    "it is known that it is not the case if one takes at least three consecutive minors  @xcite . however",
    ", along space - like paths the evolution is indeed markovian as shown in section 4 of  @xcite .",
    "the second issue concerns the correlation functions and if they have any similarities with the ones for the interlacing particle system defined above .",
    "the answer is affirmative . for @xmath516",
    "we denote by @xmath517 the @xmath475 minor of @xmath478 , which is obtained by keeping the first @xmath89 rows and columns of @xmath478 .",
    "denote by @xmath518 the eigenvalues of @xmath517 .",
    "then , at any time @xmath74 , the interlacing property ( [ eq18 ] ) holds .",
    "moreover , along space - like paths the eigenvalues process is markovian with correlation functions given as follows .",
    "[ thmmaingue ] for any @xmath519 , pick @xmath210 ( distinct ) triples @xmath520 such that @xmath434 and @xmath435 .",
    "then the eigenvalues point process is determinantal .",
    "its correlation kernel is given by where @xmath521}\\\\ & + \\frac{2}{(2\\pi{{\\rm i}})^2}\\oint_{|z|=\\delta/2}{\\mathrm{d}}z \\int_{{{\\rm i}}{\\mathbb{r}}+\\delta}{\\mathrm{d}}w \\ , \\frac{e^{w^2t_1 - 2x_1w}}{e^{z^2t_2 - 2x_2z } } \\frac{1}{w - z}\\frac{w^{n_1}}{z^{n_2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath449 .",
    "notice that this is exactly the kernel ( [ eq3.43 ] ) obtained above .",
    "the large @xmath522-asymptotics along space - like paths can be made by steep descent analysis as explained in section  [ sectasymptanalysis ] .",
    "here we present a scaling with varying levels and times for which the airy@xmath0 process arises . for asymptotics at fixed time see also  @xcite .",
    "consider the scaling @xmath523 where @xmath524 and @xmath525 . from the macroscopic picture one obtains that the smallest eigenvalue is at level @xmath526 and time @xmath527 is around @xmath528 plus fluctuations of order @xmath529 ( for the largest eigenvalue it is similar ) .",
    "thus consider the scaling @xmath530 this scaling limit corresponds to consider the rescaled smallest eigenvalues @xmath531 the accordingly rescaled correlation kernel is therefore given by @xmath532 with @xmath270 given in theorem  [ thmmaingue ] .",
    "for the asymptotic analysis , the critical point is @xmath533 .",
    "the change of variable @xmath534 and with @xmath535 and the control of the error terms leads eventually to @xmath536 with @xmath537 and @xmath538 .    by further controlling the tails of the kernel one",
    "obtains the convergence of the fredholm determinants .",
    "in particular , one obtains for the distribution of the smallest eigenvalues @xmath539 in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "the link between growth models and random matrices goes back to  @xcite .",
    "tasep can be interpreted as a stochastic growth model , by defining a height function whose discrete gradient is given by @xmath540 with @xmath61 the tasep occupation variable .",
    "then , tasep is a model in the so - called kpz universality class ( where kpz stands for kardar - parisi - zhang  @xcite ) , see also the review  @xcite .",
    "as for random matrices , where the different symmetry for goe and gue ensembles have different limiting distributions , also for growth models the limiting law differs depending on whether the initial condition is translation invariant or not , see the review  @xcite for more details .",
    "another solvable model and well - studied model in the kpz class is the polynuclear growth model , see  @xcite .",
    "a different way of analyzing tasep is to use the link to a directed last passage percolation ( lpp ) and then use the non - intersecting line ensembles approach  @xcite . for multi - point distributions , one can transfer the lpp results to distributions of particle positions or height function using the slow - decorrelation results  @xcite .",
    "the non - intersecting line ensemble approach is successful only for `` step - like '' initial condition or two - sided bernoulli , but not for `` flat '' initial condition .",
    "the latter can be analyzed using the interlacing structure too  @xcite .",
    "the tracy - widom distribution and the airy@xmath0 process shows up also in random tiling models like the aztec diamond  @xcite . it is not an accident .",
    "indeed , the construction of the markov chain explained in this lectures works also for a particle system that generates the uniform measure on aztec diamond  @xcite ( this is used for the java simulation in  @xcite , and is related to the shuffling algorithm  @xcite ) .",
    "we saw in these lectures the situations where the eigenvalues measure coincide with the measure on the interacting particle system .",
    "the connection is however restricted to space - like paths and for gue .",
    "the goe tracy - widom distribution  @xcite arises in tasep for periodic initial condition for tasep .",
    "however , the ( determinantal ) measure on interlacing points is not a positive measure , so that the fixed level measure is not a probability measure coming from some random matrix model .",
    "also , it is known that the joint distributions of particle positions with periodic initial condition is asymptotically governed by the airy@xmath541 process  @xcite , which does not give the joint distributions of the largest eigenvalue of goe dyson s brownian motion  @xcite .      in these lectures we focused at the scaling limit for the edge of the interlacing particles .",
    "if we focus in the middle , one finds the sine kernel .",
    "also , interpreting the system as a two - dimensional interface , it leads to a model in the @xmath542-dimensional anisotropic kpz class  @xcite ( another model in this class is  @xcite ) . in the bulk",
    "the height function is gaussian in a @xmath543 scale and one sees the gaussian free field ( gff ) as shown in  @xcite ( see  @xcite to learn more about the gff ) .",
    "the fact that the particle process and the minor process in general are different , can be seen also from the works of borodin where he obtain the analogue of the gff for the minors of wigner matrices  @xcite .",
    "finally , the abstract formalism of  @xcite was carried over to a new ground of the so - called macdonald processes and applied to difference operators arising from the ( multivariate ) macdonald polynomials  @xcite .",
    "this lead to a conceptual new understanding of the asymptotic behavior of random polymers in random media and finding explicit solutions of the ( nonlinear stochastic partial differential ) kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "here we give some results on transition probabilities which are translation invariant .",
    "they are taken from section  2.3 of  @xcite .",
    "our cases are obtained by limits when all @xmath544 s goes to the same value , say @xmath13 .",
    "[ propapp1 ] let @xmath546 be non - zero complex numbers and let @xmath547 be an analytic function in an annulus @xmath548 centered at the origin that contains all @xmath549 s .",

    "then , for @xmath551 , @xmath552 where @xmath553          [ propapp2 ] let @xmath546 be non - zero complex numbers and let @xmath547 be an analytic function in an annulus @xmath548 centered at the origin that contains all @xmath549 for @xmath559 and assume that @xmath550 for all @xmath559 .",
