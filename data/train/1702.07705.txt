    "relativistic heavy ions are accompanied by high photon fluxes due to their large electric charge and the strongly lorentz contracted electric fields . in relativistic heavy ion collisions",
    ", these fields can produce photonuclear interactions .",
    "when the nuclei collide and interact hadronically , strong interactions obscure these electromagnetic interactions .",
    "however , at impact parameters large enough so that no hadronic interactions occur , the photonuclear interactions can be seen ; these are ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) .",
    "the photon flux is well described within the weizscker - williams formalism @xcite .",
    "since they come from nuclei , these photons are nearly real , with virtuality set by the nuclear radius @xmath8 . for gold , @xmath9  ( gev / c)@xmath10 .",
    "vector meson photoproduction may be modeled by the photon fluctuating to a quark - antiquark pair which then scatters from the target nucleus , emerging as a real vector meson .",
    "a more detailed model treats the photon as a combination of fock states : a bare photon with virtual @xmath11 pairs , plus higher virtual states .",
    "this model described the photoproduction measurements performed at hera @xcite and is also applicable in the upc environment .",
    "the cross - section for upc photoproduction can be found by convoluting the photon flux ( with the constraint that there be no hadronic interactions ) with the photon - nucleon cross - section . for nuclear targets , one needs to account for the possibility of multiple dipole - target interactions , usually via a glauber calculation .",
    "the first calculation of upc photoproduction cross sections used hera data on @xmath12 as input to a classical glauber calculation to predict the cross section with heavy ion targets @xcite .",
    "it correctly predicted the @xmath6 photoproduction cross section at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , at energies of 62 gev / nucleon - pair @xcite , 130 @xcite and 200 gev / nucleon - pair @xcite , and up to 2.76 tev / nucleon - pair at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a later calculation treated the @xmath11 pair as a dipole in a quantum glauber calculation , which found a cross section about 50% higher , in tension with the data @xcite .",
    "recently , a modification of the quantum glauber calculation has been proposed , in which nuclear shadowing reduces the calculated @xmath6 cross section @xcite .",
    "this calculation matched the data quite well .",
    "other calculations include nuclear saturation mechanisms , including the color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "two - photon production of @xmath0 pairs also occurs , but the cross section is much smaller than for photonuclear interactions @xcite .    for photoproduction of @xmath6 mesons in gold - gold collisions at a center of mass energy of 200 gev / nucleon - pair at rhic , the rapidity range @xmath13 corresponds to photon - nucleon center - of - mass energies from 9 to 18 gev , depending on the rapidity and final state transverse momentum . in this region ,",
    "the @xmath1 photoproduction cross section increases slowly with collision energy and the @xmath12 cross section is well described by the soft - pomeron model @xcite ; the @xmath14 cross - section is almost independent of energy @xcite .    because of the high photon flux",
    ", these upc events have a high probability to be accompanied by additional photon exchanges that excite one or both of the ions into giant dipole resonances ( gdrs ) or higher excitations .",
    "the gdrs typically decay by emitting a single neutron , while higher resonances usually decay by emitting two or more neutrons @xcite .",
    "these neutrons have low momentum with respect to their parent ion , so largely retain the beam rapidity .",
    "for heavy nuclei , the cross section for multi - photon interactions nearly factorizes @xcite , with the combined cross section given by an integral over impact parameter space : @xmath15 p_1(b , a^*)p_2(b , a^*)p(b,\\rho^0),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the respective probabilities for having a hadronic interaction , exciting each of the ions and producing a @xmath6 .",
    "each photon - mediated reaction occurs via independent photon exchange , so all four probabilities are tied together only through a common impact parameter @xcite .",
    "the photonuclear cross sections are based on a parameterization of data @xcite .",
    "a unitarization process is employed to account for the possibility of multiple photons exciting a single nucleus .",
    "experimentally , requiring mutual coulomb excitation along with dipion production leads to a trigger with a higher purity , allowing more events to be collected than for the dipion state by itself .",
    "this letter reports on the measurement of exclusive @xmath6 and @xmath2 meson and direct @xmath0 photoproduction in upcs between gold ions using the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) detector at a center - of - mass energy of 200 gev / nucleon - pair .",
    "the current data sample is about 100 times larger than in previous rhic measurements @xcite , allowing for much higher precision studies and two main new results .",
    "first , the @xmath20 invariant mass distribution can not be fitted with just @xmath6 and direct @xmath0 components ; an additional contribution from photoproduction of @xmath2 , with @xmath5 is required for an acceptable fit .",
    "the second result is the observation of a detailed diffraction pattern , clearly showing the first and second minima , with a possible third .",
    "this diffraction pattern can be used to determine the distribution of the hadronic interactions in gold nuclei .",
    "this analysis uses an integrated luminosity of @xmath21b@xmath22 of data collected in 2010 .",
    "four types of star subsystems were used for triggering and event reconstruction in the analysis : the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , time of flight system ( tof ) , beam beam counters ( bbcs ) , and east and west zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) .",
    "the star tpc @xcite efficiently detects charged tracks from mid - rapidity to pseudo - rapidities beyond @xmath23 , using 45 layers of pad rows in a 2 m long cylinder . in the 0.5 t solenoidal magnetic field , the momentum resolution is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is in gev / c @xcite .",
    "the tpc can also identify charged particles by their specific ionization energy loss ( @xmath26 ) in the tpc gas .",
    "the @xmath26 resolution is 8% for a track that crosses 40 pad rows .",
    "this gives good pion / kaon / proton separation up to their respective rest masses .",
    "the tof surrounds the tpc , covering the pseudorapidity region @xmath27 @xcite . for this analysis ,",
    "the tof was used to reject tracks that are out of time with the beam crossing .",
    "the other detector components were used solely for triggering . at higher rapidities , charged particles",
    "are detected using the two bbcs , one on each side of the nominal interaction point .",
    "each is formed with 18 scintillator tiles arranged around the beam pipe , covering a pseudo - rapidity window of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the zdcs are small hadron calorimeters installed downstream of the collision region to detect neutrons at or near beam rapidity @xcite .",
    "the trigger @xcite selected 38 million events with low multiplicity in the central detector , along with one to roughly four neutrons in each zdc , along the lines described in @xcite .",
    "it required low activity in the tof detector ( at least two and no more than six hits ) , no charged particles detected in the bbc detectors and finally , showers in both zdc detectors .",
    "the zdc signals were required to be between 50 and 1200 adc counts , corresponding to an energy deposition between 1/4 and about 4 beam - energy neutrons .",
    "the one - neutron peak was centered at 198 counts , with a width ( @xmath29 ) about 55 counts , making the zdcs almost fully efficient for single neutrons .",
    "the analysis selected events containing a pair of oppositely charged tracks that were consistent with originating from a single vertex , located within 50 cm longitudinally of the nominal interaction point .",
    "the tracks were required to have at least 14 hits in the tpc ( out of a possible 45 ) , and have @xmath26 values within 3@xmath30 of the expected @xmath26 for a pion . both tracks in each pair were required to have a valid hit in the tof system to reject tracks from other beam crossings .",
    "this requirement also limited the track acceptance largely to the region @xmath31 .",
    "the 384,000 events with a @xmath0 pair invariant mass in the range @xmath32 gev / c@xmath33 were saved for further evaluation .",
    "the largest backgrounds for this analysis are low - multiplicity hadronic interactions ( peripheral ion - ion collisions ) .",
    "other backgrounds come from other upc reactions or from cosmic - rays accompanied by in - time mutual coulomb excitation .",
    "pure electromagnetic production of @xmath34 pairs contribute less than 4% to the @xmath6 peak @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath35 produces a @xmath0 pair with a larger @xmath36 than for coherent photoproduction , and a pair invariant mass that is usually below 600 mev .",
    "it was a 2.7% background in a previous analysis @xcite , and , due to a higher cut on the pair invariant mass , should be smaller here .",
    "we neglect these minor backgrounds here ; they are well within the overall systematic errors .",
    "the hadronic background is estimated from the like - sign pion pairs .",
    "figure [ fig : pionpairpt ] compares the transverse momentum ( @xmath36 ) distribution of the @xmath0 pairs ( black histogram ) with the corresponding distribution for like - sign pairs ( red histogram ) in vertices recorded with only two tracks .",
    "the signal distribution has a prominent peak for @xmath37 mev / c , from coherent photoproduction of pion pairs from the gold nucleus .",
    "the reconstructed events are corrected for acceptance and detection efficiency using a detailed simulation of the star detector . a mix of @xmath6 mesons and non - resonant @xmath0 events",
    "are generated using the starlight monte carlo @xcite which reproduces the kinematics of the processes , including the mass and rapidity distributions .",
    "the generated events are passed through a complete geant @xcite simulation of the detector and then embedded in ` zero bias ' star events .",
    "zero - bias events are data from randomly selected beam crossings .",
    "this embedding procedure accurately accounts for the detector noise and backgrounds , including overlapping events recorded in the star tpc during its sizable active time windows . as fig .",
    "[ fig : validation ] shows , the agreement between the monte carlo and data is very good .",

    "the simulated upcs were run through a geant simulation of the detector , embedded in randomly triggered ( zero - bias ) events , and subject to the same reconstruction programs as the data . ]",
    "the event reconstruction efficiency depends only weakly on the pair mass and pair @xmath36 , but depends fairly strongly on rapidity .",
    "the rapidity dependence has a bell shape with a maximum of 13% efficiency at @xmath38 .",
    "it is slightly asymmetric because of inefficiencies in one of the tpc east ( rapidity @xmath39 ) sectors .",
    "one uncertainty in the reconstruction efficiency stems from uncertainties in the actual ( ` as - built ' ) positions of the tof slats , which may not be completely accurately reflected in the simulations . while this uncertainty may affect the measured @xmath40 , particularly at large rapidity",
    ", it does not significantly affect the pair @xmath36 or mass acceptance uncertainties .",
    "this analysis considers two classes of nuclear breakup : single neutrons ( 1n ) , associated with giant dipole resonances , or more than one neutron ( xn ) , from a broad range of photonuclear interactions .",
    "figure [ fig : zdcfit ] shows the adc distribution from the west zdc for events that satisfy a cut which selects events with a single neutron in the east zdc and a photoproduced @xmath1  with @xmath41 and @xmath42 mev / c .",
    "table [ tab : neutroncs ] shows the cross - sections for coherent @xmath6 photoproduction accompanied by different numbers of neutrons .",
    "there is some non - linearity in the system .",
    "the cross sections are determined by applying a window to one zdc spectrum and fitting the neutron spectrum in the other , and then reversing the procedure .",
    "the fits included events with one , two , three , or four neutrons in each zdc .",
    "the one and two neutron peaks are very clear , but the higher peaks are less obvious .",
    "the two results are averaged , and the difference is used as an estimate of the systematic error .",
    "statistical errors are @xmath43 and are not listed .",
    "systematic errors arising from the event - selection cuts were added in quadrature to the quadrature sum of the relevant common uncertainties listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : common ] ( 17% ) .",
    "the limited zdc window led to a relatively high yield of photoproduced @xmath6 per trigger , but the cost was that it did not cover the full neutron number spectrum .",
    "so , we used the @xmath44  events to normalize the xnxn cross section , based on the starlight @xcite calculation of the cross section ratio .",
