    "macroscopic study of pattern - forming and clustering properties of mobile species starts with examining their collective behavior and applying the physical laws to drive mathematical models . from this perspective , the dynamics of any mobile species in space is characterized by elements such as concentration , proliferation , degradation , and random and directional movement , following physical rules such as the conservation principle .    in the study of mobile biological species , directional movement based on chemical signals ,",
    "known as chemotaxis , plays an important role .",
    "a pioneer mathematical model of chemotaxis is due to keller and segal in 1970 @xcite .",
    "they proposed a system of four strongly coupled parabolic differential equations to describe aggregation of cellular slim molds . since then their model and its variants have been the subject of many studies , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the focus of this work will be on a main variant of the classic keller - segal model .",
    "based on previous studies of the semi - solid medium experiments @xcite , this work will focus on the diffusion - chemotaxis models with proliferation source @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the population density of biological individuals , and @xmath2 is the chemoattractant concentration ; system parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive constants representing the diffusion and chemotactic coefficients respectively ; and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive constants . here",
    "@xmath7 is a nonlinear proliferation source term .",
    "the equation is defined on a rectangular domain @xmath8 and is supplemented with no - flux boundary conditions .",
    "an essential component in pattern - forming behavior of the modified ks system is phase transition .",
    "the presentence of the chemotaxis source term , @xmath7 , will allow finite amplitude patterns to continue to exist in a longer time - scale @xcite",
    ". however , persistence of patterns is not rigorously known . in this work",
    "we follow the general framework proposed by t. ma and s. wang in their studies of phase transitions of dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "strongly motivated by phase transition problems in nonlinear sciences , their dynamic transition theory aims at finding a full set of transition states .",
    "the set of transition states is represented by a local attractor near or away from the basic state .",
    "in fact , the fundamental element of their theory is the introduction of a dynamic classification scheme for phase transitions .",
    "dynamic transitions are classified into three types : continuous ( type - i ) , jump ( type - ii ) and mix ( type - iii ) .",
    "the greatest advantage of this classification scheme and the related dynamic transition theory is that it provides a complete set of the transition states and their dynamic properties .",
    "once the type of the dynamic transition is determined for a given equilibrium system , the order of transitions in the classical sense immediately becomes transparent , leading to precise understanding of the underlying physical system .",
    "another important feature of the present work concerns the existence and persistence of hexagonal patterns .",
    "in fact we will derive the necessary conditions for formation of hexagonal patterns when two modes become unstable . in this work",
    "we will derive transition equations which give a larger picture of the dynamics ; this study will underline the transient states and include the final steady state bifurcated solutions from the trivial solution ; thus we will be able to understand the connection between these components since the transition equations will provide a comprehensive picture of the main qualitative dynamics .",
    "it should be mentioned that the bifurcation analysis of the diffusion - chemotaxis models with proliferation source has been conducted in several works , see @xcite ( and references therein ) where the bifurcation problem of the stationary system has been studied ; also see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is also known that hexagonal patterns can emerge from three unstable modes with no restriction on the geometry of the spatial domain ; and , in fact , the existence of hexagonal patterns with three unstable modes has been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "consider a bacterial species which moves in a medium where two main components lead its macroscopic behavior , namely a chemoattractant and a stimulant .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is the population density of biological individuals , @xmath2 is the chemoattractant concentration , and @xmath9 is the stimulant concentration . it is discussed that the physical laws will lead us to the following model which is a modification of the original keller - segel system : @xmath10    where @xmath11 , and @xmath4 , @xmath12 s , @xmath3 s , and @xmath13 s are all positive constants , and @xmath14 is the nutrient source .",
    "when the stimulant @xmath9 is ample , that is @xmath15 , the last equation in the above system can be ignored .",
    "we also have @xmath16 the following change of variables @xmath17 result in a non - dimensionalized system ( after dropping the primes ) : @xmath18[l]{\\qquad\\fbox{\\rm eq.uv } }                            \\else                               \\marginpar{\\vspace{0.7\\baselineskip }                                          \\hspace{-1.1\\textwidth }                                          \\fbox{\\rmeq.uv } }                            \\fi                         \\fi                         \\label{eq.uv }                        } \\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
