    "trapped waves in open geometries have been known for sixty years now @xcite .",
    "ursell @xcite , in a theoretical and experimental study of  beach \" waves in a particular semi  infinite canal , found that the system has discrete , continuous and mixed spectra , and predicted the existence of a confined resonance at a discrete frequency , while at a cutoff frequency the resonance extends a long way down the canal .",
    "these waves can be described by the helmholtz equation subject to dirichlet boundary conditions and therefore similar confinement properties are expected in the solutions of analogous acoustic or electromagnetic problems . indeed ,",
    "about fifteen years after ursell , long - lived resonance modes in open laser systems were reported@xcite .",
    "even more , since this setup is equivalent to that of electrons in open configurations described by the time - independent schrdinger equation , by 1984 , several studies already suggested that confinement is also a feature of the two - dimensional transport of charge carriers in ultrafine metal and semiconductor devices@xcite . from then on , many theoretical and experimental studies have shown that , generally , by bending and crossing waveguides and quantum wires , bound ( confined , trapped ) states can be obtained with energies below the continuous spectrum@xcite .",
    "moreover , many similar quantum wire systems have been found with bound states embedded into the continuum@xcite .",
    "bound states just below the continuum may strongly influence the scattering of waves and charge carriers .",
    "this allows to detect them and it is also the source of new phenomena and applications . for instance , mesoscopic systems with similar geometries are common in nanoelectronics and it has been shown experimentally that they exhibit suppression ( `` quenching '' ) of the hall resistance@xcite , and enhanced bend resistance@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the above mentioned bound states exist only due to a particular symmetry , when this symmetry is broken , resonances could be expected to arise .",
    "therefore , the confinement of electromagnetic radiation at the intersection of coupled waveguides opens a window for a new kind of resonator , which combines a very simplified spectrum to high performances@xcite .",
    "similar phenomena should be also relevant for the performance of novel kinds of ( cold ) atom@xcite , phonon@xcite and laser waveguides@xcite .",
    "even more , the possibility of geometrically inducing confined states allows for the design of unused ways to create a bose - einstein condensate in a quasi - one dimensional bose gas@xcite .",
    "last but not least , besides the possible practical applications , it should be noted that such systems constitute a very interesting theoretical framework for studying the correspondence between classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "note that , in this kind of arrangements , classical motion of point particles with finite energy is typically unbound because there are not forbidden regions along the wires .",
    "therefore , a phase - space semiclassical approximation to dynamics seems to be not valid here , and this is particularly relevant if the corresponding classical motion exhibits chaos@xcite .",
    "a relevant question , from both the theoretical and experimental point of view , is how strongly depend the properties of the bound states on the perturbation of the structure and , this way , on the mechanical imperfections .",
    "amongst other factors , is perhaps the symmetry of the configuration what plays the fundamental role since it controls the coupling with the propagating modes .",
    "some studies suggested that the isolated bounded modes are not affected by the level of symmetry and thus , they can exist under very general conditions@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a comprehensive analysis of the role of symmetry is still lacking .    in a classical paper written more than twenty years ago schult , ravenhall and wyld@xcite studied the problem of an electron which can freely move in a two dimensional symmetric region of orthogonally crossed wires of finite width and infinite length .",
    "they showed that the ground state of this system corresponds to a state where the electron is confined in the region of the crossing , with an energy which falls below the threshold of the continuum , @xmath0 . using two different numerical approaches ( finite differences and a mode expansion ) they estimated the ratio between the ground state energy and the threshold energy , @xmath1 .",
    "they also identified a second bound state , with odd - odd symmetry , corresponding to a ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the energy of this second state falls below the threshold of the continuum for odd - odd states .",
    "these results were later confirmed by avishai et al.@xcite .",
    "more recently , amore , fernndez and rodriguez@xcite , have used the conformal collocation method ( ccm)@xcite to obtain a precise value for the ground state of the infinite cross , using a non uniform grid .",
    "they obtained @xmath3 .",
    "trefethen and betcke@xcite , on the other hand have obtained a precise value for the second bound state , @xmath4 ( notice that these authors report the value of @xmath5 , from which the ratio can be obtained ) .",
    "different geometries are closely related to the symmetric cross .",
    "bulgakov and collaborators have studied the properties of a configuration of non - orthogonal (  scissor - shaped \" ) crossed wires , observing the emergence of multiple bound states below the continuum as the angle between the arms is reduced  @xcite .",
    "a particular case of t - shaped waveguide is obtained from the symmetric cross by desymmetrizing the region for even - odd modes , although this particular system does not support bound states .",
    "nazarov  @xcite , analyzed the bound states of a similar configuration , but with arms of different widths .",
    "taking into account the above mentioned relevance of the symmetries for the spectrum , in this paper we study a different modification of the case discussed by schult et al.@xcite , considering an asymmetric cross , with orthogonal arms of different width .",
    "our goal is to investigate the behavior of the bound states of this system , as one of the arms is enlarged , and the possibility of the disappearance of these states or the appearance of new bound states .",
    "the related l and t shaped configurations are also analyzed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_1 ] we describe the system of the asymmetric cross and we make qualitative predictions on the behavior of the bound states as one of the arms is enlarged ; in section [ results ] we present the numerical results , which have been obtained using a collocation method ; finally , in section [ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , schult , ravenhall and wyld@xcite have proved that an electron which moves freely in an infinite symmetric cross is localized in the central region of the cross when it finds itself in the ground state .",
    "they also discovered a second localized state , which is the lowest energy state with odd - odd symmetry .",
    "the goal of our paper is to investigate the behavior of these modes ( as well as the possible appearance of further localized states ) , as the width of one of the two arms is changed , thus obtaining the asymmetric cross , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "[ fig_1 ]    in particular , we ask ourselves whether the localized modes of the symmetric cross can survive to arbitrary perturbations of this kind : what happens when one of the arms is much smaller than the other ? would we still have bound states ? what does this imply for the l and t shaped configurations ?    to answer our questions we need to solve the scalar helmholtz equation -  _ n(x , y ) = e_n _ n(x , y )  , [ eq_1 ] where @xmath6 and we are using @xmath7 .",
    "the wave functions obey dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath8 .",
    "we have called @xmath9 and @xmath10 the widths of the two arms , defining @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 one recovers the symmetric cross ) .    before trying to answer our question in a quantitative way",
    ", we may attack the problem qualitatively .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath13 , meaning that the width of the horizontal arm is much larger than the width of the vertical arm , and assume that there is at least one localized solution to eq.([eq_1 ] ) .",
    "this situation is represented in fig.[fig_2 ] :    .",
    ", width=188 ]    [ fig_2 ]    the grey regions in this plot represent the forbidden region , where the eigenfunctions of eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) must vanish identically ; we assume that the dimensions of the red rectangle are large enough so that the localized wave functions are exponentially small outside the rectangle .    under these assumptions ,",
    "one may attempt an approximate solution of the original problem inside the rectangle , and thus obtain accurate approximations to the bound states of eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) , if they exist .",
    "the fundamental idea is to represent eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) as a schrdinger equation _",
    "n(x , y ) = e_n _ n(x , y )  , [ eq_2 ] with v(x , y ) & = & \\ {    ccc 0 & , & ( x , y ) + & , & ( x , y )    .  .",
    "to allow numerical calculation the exact potential @xmath14 is replaced by an approximate potential @xmath15 : ( x , y ) & = & \\ {    ccc 0 & , & ( x , y ) + v_0 & , & ( x , y )    .  , which takes a large but finite value @xmath16 in the forbidden region .",
    "if @xmath16 is large enough ( much larger than the energies of the lowest states ) , the wave functions of these states are exponentially suppressed in the classically forbidden region ( the grey region in the figure ) , and the contribution from this region becomes negligible .",
    "the advantage of reformulating the problem in this way should be clear , since we may now work on the entire rectangle , @xmath17 , and use the orthonormal basis _",

    "kaufman , kosztin and schulten  @xcite have used this approach to calculate approximations to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the negative laplacian on finite domains , applying the rayleigh - ritz method to the schrdinger equation with @xmath19 on a rectangular domain fully enclosing the region .",
    "the accuracy of this method clearly depends both on the finite value of the potential step @xmath16 used in the numerical calculation and the ratio between the areas of @xmath20 and the portion of area of @xmath21 falling inside @xmath20 ( which we call @xmath22 ) : if the area of @xmath20 is much larger than the area of @xmath22 , a large number of basis functions will be needed in the calculation to achieve a suppression of the wavefunctions in the classically forbidden regions .",
    "since we are interested in the limit @xmath23 , we may use a simpler and more direct approach : provided that the rectangle @xmath20 is very thin , the lowest modes of eq.([eq_2 ] ) on @xmath20 will be dominated by the longitudinal modes of the basis , with negligible contributions from the transverse excited modes .",
    "this observation justifies the possibility of using a portion of the hilbert space of the problem , corresponding to the states @xmath24 .    in this limit the  high  energy \" modes essentially decouple from the problem and we may work with an effective hamiltonian , obtained by averaging the original hamiltonian with respect to the mode @xmath25 : _",

    "] , we may easily convince ourselves that the effective potential of figs.[fig_3 ] and [ fig_5 ] corresponds to a finite well potential with a infinite wall on one side ( see the left plot of fig.[fig_6 ] ) , whereas the case of fig.[fig_4 ] is analogous to the one of fig.[fig_2 ] .",

    "admit localized solutions when the potential well is either very narrow or very shallow .",
    "these simple arguments allow us to make the following predictions :    * the fundamental mode of the symmetric cross stays always bounded , as the width of one of the two arms is increased arbitrarily , but remains finite ; * the fundamental mode of a domain with the shape of an infinite l ( which is the lowest energy odd - odd mode of the symmetric cross ) is bounded , but becomes unbounded as the width of any of the two arms is increased , while keeping fixed the width of the other arm ; * the fundamental mode of an infinite t shaped domain ( even - odd modes of the asymmetric cross ) , shown in fig.[fig_4 ] , is not bound for the symmetric cross , but it becomes bound as the width @xmath27 , but remains finite ; * the fundamental mode of the  rotated \" t of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ( odd - even modes of the asymmetric cross ) , is not bound either for the symmetric cross or as @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the predictions regarding the t - shaped infinite domain in fig.[fig_4 ] are in agreement with the findings of nazarov @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we describe the numerical methods that we have used to test these predictions and we present the numerical results obtained with these methods .",
    "the correctness of the analysis in the previous section strongly depends on the assumption of the decoupling of the  high - energy \" modes which leads to an effective one - dimensional problem . however , we are interested in any perturbation of the symmetry , not only the large ones given by @xmath13 .",

    "the maximum size of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is essentially dictated by the total number of collocation points corresponding to this choice .",
    "on the other hand , excessively large values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 should be avoided , since they increase the number of collocation points and therefore the computational power needed in the calculation .",

    "a drastic reduction of the number of functions however can be achieved by considering only functions which are peaked at points internal to the cross .    a second observation concerns the choice of @xmath47 , i.e. the number of collocation points in each orthogonal direction : although in principle , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) can take any integer value , it is convenient to pick values of @xmath47 which allow to sample exactly the border of the cross .",

    ", this seems to imply that adding just a very small perturbation on a very large one - dimensional quantum wire or waveguide may have a striking impact on the transport of charge carriers or waves along it .",

    "finally , for the t - shaped configuration no bound state arises when the width of the horizontal arm is decreased towards zero .",
    "how strong are these effects as to be observable and appliable will depend on how strong is the departure of the actual experimental setup from the ideal configurations considered . nevertheless , if the dependence on the symmetry found here is confirmed by future experiments , then it could be used as a switch - like mechanism for trapping and untrapping waves and charge carriers .",

    "<S> the behavior of bound states in asymmetric cross , t and l shaped configurations is considered . </S>",
    "<S> because of the symmetries of the wavefunctions , the analysis can be reduced to the case of an electron localized at the intersection of two orthogonal crossed wires of different width . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations show that the fundamental mode of this system remains bound for the widths that we have been able to study directly ; moreover , the extrapolation of the results obtained for finite widths suggests that this state remains bound even when the width of one arm becomes infinitesimal . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a qualitative argument which explains this behavior and that can be generalized to the lowest energy states in each symmetry class . in the case of odd - odd states of the cross we find that the lowest mode is bounded when the width of the two arms is the same and stays bound up to a critical value of the ratio between the widths ; in the case of the even - odd states we find that the lowest mode is unbound up to a critical value of the ratio between the widths . </S>",
    "<S> our qualitative arguments suggest that the bound state survives as the width of the vertical arm becomes infinitesimal . </S>"
