    "the existence of @xmath0-nuclear bound states , such as @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 has been predicted by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "they constructed a phenomenological @xmath5 potential , using experimental data on free @xmath5 scattering lengths and on kaonic hydrogen x - rays , with the peculiar ansatz that the @xmath6 resonance is a @xmath5 bound state , instead of a simple baryon with a three - quark structure . in this model the strongly attractive @xmath5 interaction , in the isospin @xmath7 state , may lead to tremendously condensed systems with a cluster structure and a central nucleon density as high as 1.5 @xmath8 . in this model very narrow ( @xmath9 100 mev ) and",
    "deeply bound ( @xmath10 mev ) kaon states ( dbks ) are expected .",
    "the debate on their existence is still open and different theoretical approaches , quite in disagreement , have been developed ( see @xcite for a summary of theoretical issues ) .",
    "the main question concerns whether the potential is shallow or deep and , then , if the decay width is narrow enough , compared to the binding energy , to allow their observation .",
    "furthermore , since final state interactions ( fsi ) could fake a signal , positive experimental results could be attributed to such an effect .",
    "since dbks are very dense systems , made of a strange particle and a few nucleons , the study of this system is related to kaon condensation @xcite and is important to understand astrophysical objects such as the neutron stars , where the nuclear density could reach ten times the ordinary one and where strangeness degrees of freedom could play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "this could lead to the formation of strange quark matter , which could be more stable than the ordinary nuclear matter . for this reason , even after some years , the study of dbks keeps on being a hot topic in hadron physics .",
    "the first observation of a few hints for the lightest nuclear dbks , the @xmath1 , was done by the finuda experiment @xcite at the da@xmath11ne @xmath12 collider in frascati , stopping @xmath13 of low energy in very thin targets of @xmath14-shell nuclei . here , a narrow peak ( @xmath15 mev ) has been observed in the @xmath16p invariant mass spectrum at a mass @xmath172.26 gev / c@xmath18 corresponding to a binding energy b @xmath19 mev .",
    "therefore , the @xmath16p pairs , which exhibit a clean back - to - back topology , have been interpreted as the decay products of such a state .",
    "new analyses of old experiments , such as obelix @xcite at cern with @xmath20 annihilations at rest and disto @xcite at saturne with the exclusive @xmath21 production at @xmath22 = 2.85 gev , claim the observation of dbks .",
    "nevertheless , their existence has not been established yet and further measurements are planned in the near future at several facilities . since all of them uses kaon beams interacting with nuclear targets or heavy ion collisions , where the formation of the nuclear kaonic state occurs in the nuclear medium , new experiments in different environments could help to find out signatures of the existence of such states .",
    "in particular , a search of production of dbks in the vacuum , rather than in the medium , can be performed at b - factories , in the direct decays of the lightest bottomonium .",
    "in the bottomonium spectrum below the @xmath23 threshold there are three states , the @xmath2 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the large mass of these resonances ( @xmath26 gev / c@xmath18 ) is suitable to produce baryons and anti - baryons , and few - body bound systems , as well .",
    "it should be noted that the branching ratio for the strong decays of @xmath2 amounts to @xmath27 .",
    "these direct decays proceed via three gluons , hence the decay products are the result of their hadronization .",
    "these glue - rich decays might also produce exotic multiquark states .",
    "for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 resonances , direct radiative decays , both e.m . and",
    "hadronic , compete with the gluon annihilation modes ; but these states can be used to produce the @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known , since many years , that baryon production from @xmath28(1s ) is enhanced with respect to the continuum hadronization @xcite . in particular , the cleo experiment @xcite at cesr , studying the inclusive production of baryons / antibaryons in @xmath12 collisions at @xmath29 gev , finds that the enhancements of per - event total particle yields for @xmath16 hyperon , proton and antiproton are about a factor of two in the @xmath30 decays as compared to the non resonant nearby @xmath31 continuum ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the enhancement for @xmath16 production is the highest one ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "these results are not accounted for by the jetset 7.3 fragmentation model . for the decays through gg@xmath34 the enhancements are smaller ( except for @xmath16 s which is a factor @xmath17 2 ) and more in agreement with jetset expectations .",
    "most interesting , concerning the differences between quark / gluon - fragmentation in the @xmath29 gev energy range , is the experimental evidence of bound state production , such as deuteron ( @xmath35 ) and antideuteron ( @xmath36 ) , in gluonic decays of @xmath28(1s ) and @xmath28(2s ) , that was first observed by argus @xcite with very low statistics and , recently , by cleo @xcite . in particular",
    ", cleo finds that the branching ratio @xmath37(@xmath38 ) is of the order of 3@xmath3910@xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the results show that @xmath36 production is at least three times more likely in the hadronization of @xmath41 ( for n = 1 , 2 ) through ggg and gg@xmath34 , compared to the hadronization of @xmath31 for the continuum production , where only an upper limit of 1@xmath3910@xmath40 has been evaluated from the @xmath42 cross section . besides ,",
    "an upper limit of 1@xmath3910@xmath40 has been measured for the production of @xmath36 from @xmath43 .",
    "cleo also investigated how often the @xmath36 baryon number is compensated by a @xmath35 or by a combination of two nucleons ( n , p ) : the first case occurs 1% of the times . since the theoretical description of @xmath35 or @xmath36 formation is based on the statistical coalescence model @xcite , where a @xmath44 and @xmath45 close to each other in phase space bind together , a precise determination of such a percentage is important , because double coalescence is unlikely and a different production mechanism , such as a primary ( globally ) production might be involved",
    ".    it can be also interesting to note that in heavy ion collisions the formation of bound systems , such as light nuclei / anti - nuclei or hypernuclei / anti - hypernuclei , occurs through coalescence processes .",
    "for instance , the star @xcite experiment at rhic has measured the ratios of the yields of anti-@xmath46 and @xmath46 and of anti-@xmath47 and @xmath47 in au - au collisions at @xmath48 = 200 gev , which amount to @xmath17 0.5 , favouring the coalescence hypothesis . at star (",
    "anti)hypernuclei are produced with similar yields of ( anti)nuclei , different from what happens at lower energies .",
    "recently , the hunt for dbks is also started in heavy ion collision experiments @xcite , but their identification in the medium is a challenge .",
    "since bound state systems , such as antideuterons , have been found in the decays of @xmath49 , with n = 1 , 2 , we propose to search for dbks at the future superb factory @xcite , which will be built in the tor vergata university campus in rome . here",
    ", large numbers of heavy leptons and heavy quark mesons will be produced using an e@xmath50e@xmath51 asymmetric collider , operated at a c.m .",
    "energy corresponding to the rest mass of the bottomonium resonance @xmath43 with a luminosity of 10@xmath52@xmath53s@xmath54 , looking for new physics . thanks to the nano - beam scheme , at lnf - infn , an unprecedented integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath55/year will be achieved .",
    "a magnetic spectrometer will be installed at the machine , covering a large solid angle and designed to detect and fully reconstruct both charged and neutral particles with high efficiency and energy resolution .",
    "operating the machine at an energy below the @xmath23 threshold it will be possible to select the rest mass of @xmath28(ns ) ( with n = 1 , 2 , 3 ) in order to study the production of dbks in the decays which proceed through the hadronization of three gluons .",
    "the lightest nuclear dbks , the @xmath13pp , can be identified through its @xmath56 decay mode , searching for a narrow peak ( @xmath9 100 mev / c@xmath18 ) at a mass of about 2.25 gev / c@xmath18 in the @xmath56 invariant mass spectrum and measuring the @xmath57 angular correlations , which can give imporant hints on the nature of the event .",
    "we can rely on the high performance of the superb apparatus for particle i d and full topological event reconstruction for an effective identification of the dbks .    since there is",
    "no medium , fsi are negligible with respect to experiments using kaon beams on nuclear targets or heavy ion collisions .",
    "moreover , we expect that the identification from the vacuum is easier and cleaner than in heavy ion collisions .",
    "nowadays , the study of kaonic nuclear states is a hot topic in hadron physics , because their existence is related to kaon condensation and to the physics of the core of neutron stars .",
    "theoretical models disagree about the possibility to observe such states and only scarce experimental measurements in the nuclear medium are available .",
    "more and new experiments in different environments would be useful for a comparative analysis of the results .",
    "search of the light @xmath1 state could be extended from the nuclear medium to the vacuum , looking for its production in the strong decays of @xmath2 at future b - factories , taking advantage of the high luminosity of these machines .",
    "measurements of the production yields of this state from the lightest bottomonium should give important clues , not only about the nature of these states , but also about the hadronization processes of quarks and gluons .",
