    "<S> homodyne and heterodyne detection are the `` twin - pillars '' of quantum displacement sensing using optical cavities , having permitted major breakthroughs including detection of gravitational waves and of the motion of quantum ground - state cooled mechanical oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> both can suffer disadvantages as diagnostics in quantum optomechanics , either through symmetrisation ( homodyning ) , or loss of correlations ( heterodyning ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for modest heterodyne beat frequencies ( @xmath0 ) , judicious sampling of the autocorrelation of the measured current time trace yields a hybrid , combining both homodyne and heterodyne spectral components ; it is also possible to control whether the recovered correlations appear in isolation or interfere with the original sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is straightforward but surprisingly robust : we simulate experimental realisations with explicit stochastic numerics and find excellent agreement with analytical quantum noise spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we term retrospective recovery of lost correlations in optomechanics `` r - heterodyning '' : as the method simply involves post - processing of a normal heterodyne time signal , there is no additional experimental constraint other than on the magnitude of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the extraordinary sensitivity of cavity - mediated detection was demonstrated by the recent ligo detection of gravitational waves @xcite which sensed displacements even down to order @xmath2 m. earlier versions of ligo employed a radio - frequency ( rf ) heterodyne detection system , but this was later replaced by a homodyne scheme @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the related field of quantum cavity optomechanics has also exposed a rich seam of interesting phenomena arising from the coupling between the mode of a cavity and a small mechanical oscillator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several groups have successfully cooled a mechanical oscillator @xcite down to its quantum ground state ( or very close to it ) hence to mean phonon occupancy @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> read - out of the temperature was achieved by detection of motional sidebands in the cavity output by homodyne or heterodyne methods .    </S>",
    "<S> an important herald of quantum optomechanics is the appearance of asymmetric displacement sidebands ; these have been detected experimentally and extensively investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> albeit indirectly @xcite , the observations mirror an underlying asymmetry in the motional spectrum : an oscillator in its ground state @xmath4 , can absorb a phonon and down - convert the photon frequency ( stokes process ) ; but it can no longer emit any energy and up - convert a photon ( anti - stokes process ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is most readily investigated with heterodyne detection @xcite since , for homodyne detection two separate experiments are required whereby a probe scans the sideband with two separate frequencies ( blue and red detuned ) .    </S>",
    "<S> sideband asymmetry has become an important tool in optomechanics and has now been used to establish cooling limited by only quantum backaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ponderomotive squeezing , whereby narrowband cavity output falls below the technical imprecision noise floor is also of much current interest @xcite though is also observed in oscillators in a high thermal state .        in balanced homodyne or heterodyne detection , the output field of a cavity </S>",
    "<S> is amplified by beating with a reference local oscillator @xmath5 of amplitude @xmath6 much larger than cavity output amplitudes , and is subsequently detected as a current which ( normalised to @xmath6 ) takes the form : @xmath7 homodyne detection corresponds to @xmath8 so leads to detection of a single quadrature @xmath9 , permitting experimental investigation of quantum squeezing @xcite observed typically in the power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath10 of the current . </S>",
    "<S> the wiener - kinchin theorem permits calculation of the psd via the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the current : @xmath11 noting that for the real current @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in actual optomechanics experiments , the finite - time ft above is used for long time traces @xmath13 ; the interesting dynamical features like sidebands , have width of order @xmath14 , the total damping combining intrinsic mechanical ( @xmath15 ) and optical ( @xmath16 ) damping and to resolve them we need @xmath17 . the actual measured current @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , is obtained as a real time series of data at different times .    for </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 one obtains the homodyne current @xmath20 , which can be written : @xmath21 the last two terms represent coherent contributions which make the homodyne psd strongly depend on the measured quadrature . as illustrated in fig.[fig1](b ) the psd varies sharply with @xmath22 and its value drops below the technical imprecision noise floor in between the white lines in the figure , an effect termed ponderomotive squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> the measured current is the single - sided symmetrised version @xmath23 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for @xmath24 , heterodyne detection yields the psd : @xmath25 for experimental time - traces where @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the rotating quadratures @xmath27 lead to averaging out in time and loss of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 components , as may be seen by comparison with eq.[homo ] and there is no longer any dependence on @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the sidebands are shifted : if the cavity output is modulated by dynamics of characteristic frequencies @xmath30 , the heterodyne current exhibits sidebands peaked near @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in fig 1(b ) we compare homodyne and heterodyne psds ( on a log scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the homodyne psd show a strong dependence on the detection quadrature , while in contrast , the heterodyne spectra are completely insensitive to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the heterodyne psds show two , rather than one , sidebands near @xmath33 . although the spectrum is symmetric about @xmath34 , in the quantum regime , the sidebands are not symmetric about @xmath1 : stokes / anti - stokes sideband asymmetry , a halmark of quantum optomechanics , is thus seen in current experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that as the dynamics is given in the frame rotating at the frequency @xmath35 of the laser driving the cavity , all frequencies represent shifts about @xmath36 : there are no absolute negative frequencies ) as @xmath34 in fact @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison between eq.[heterodynepsd ] and eq.[homo ] shows that the first equation does not reduce to the latter as @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the fact that the transition is abrupt : since @xmath39 , the additional correlations are fully averaged out . </S>",
    "<S> optomechanics experiments do not easily probe the heterodyne - homodyne transition . since @xmath40 the heterodyne sidebands of fig.[fig1](b ) become unresolvable as @xmath38 , before the correlations reappear in the true @xmath8 limit . </S>",
    "<S> hence one may define an @xmath8 but _ heterodyne _ spectrum : @xmath41 arising from the merging of sidebands as @xmath42 , which contains no additional correlations ; there is simply a single peak which is invariant with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the output current is coherent and the cavity noises in typical optomechanical experiments are still stationary : the damage arises purely in the heterodyne time - averaging step .    </S>",
    "<S> hence we show in the present manuscript that for arbitrarily long @xmath43 but modest @xmath44 there is a robust and completely straightforward procedure to recover the lost correlations and to obtain a spectrum : @xmath45 \\label{rheterodyne}\\ ] ] which includes both heterodyne and homodyne features ; as the @xmath46 is a simple @xmath22 invariant peak , it can be estimated or measured , and hence the homodyne spectrum @xmath47 can also be recovered to a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this is distinct from any electronic demodulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the heterodyne spectrum is relatively unperturbed . as seen in fig.[fig1](d ) one may obtain a spectrum ( middle panel ) that simultaneously exhibits quantum sideband asymmetry as well as quantum squeezing : the recovered @xmath22 dependence is evident from the plots .        </S>",
    "<S> the first step to test this approach is to generate an explicit stochastic simulation of heterodyne current time series @xmath48 , for @xmath49 which would be measured experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we can then compare numerical spectra with analytical solutions of eqs.[homo],[heterodynepsd ] and eq.[rheterodyne ] . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic langevin numerics were previously developed to accurately simulate levitated optomechanics experiments @xcite . here , they are refined to accurately reproduce correlations between input noise to the cavity and the cavity filtered noises making the computations more laborious , ( @xmath50 with typically 100 stochastic realisations ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider two optical modes ( for cooling , one for detection ) and obtain the analytical quantum noise spectra for the two - mode problem as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> excellent quantitative agreement was obtained , especially for input optical noise @xmath51 levels very slightly higher than shot noise ( e.g. taking @xmath52 in @xmath53 rather than @xmath54 ) in both the semiclassical stochastic numerics and the quantum analytical solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> we express the normalised psd of the current @xmath55 using the usual ` initial - time ' form of the autocorrelation : @xmath56 without loss of generality we usually take @xmath57 for a stationary spectrum and set @xmath58 . however , if we for example , we consider the @xmath59 terms in the heterodyne measurement , we obtain @xmath60 and the integral over @xmath61 ensures the contribution is zero </S>",
    "<S> . however we obtain the most interesting results from the less usual ` mean - time ' form :    @xmath62    where we pivot the lag times @xmath63 symmetrically about the mean time . </S>",
    "<S> we then simply sample only values of @xmath64 , for @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is straightforward : restricting ourselves to @xmath66 clearly protects the correlation term . </S>",
    "<S> however , surprisingly , sampling @xmath67 or even @xmath68 is still effective , primarily because the @xmath69 sampling eliminates the imaginary @xmath70 contribution . </S>",
    "<S> as a result we can retain one third of the data points ( or even half ) and still obtain excellent results : the key is to ensure sampling which eliminates complex contributions , ensuring @xmath59 ( or equivalently @xmath71 ) is real . </S>",
    "<S> we term this @xmath72-sampled rheterodyne .    </S>",
    "<S> the term is normalised appropriately by a constant normalisation prefactor of order @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is illustrated schematically in fig.[fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent quantitative agreement with analytical calculation of @xmath74 $ ] is shown for a steady state phonon occupancy of about @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the signal to noise ratio is of of course worse by a corresponding factor of 2 or so . </S>",
    "<S> while practical implementation would ideally involve storing the lo phase with time in each experiment , this is not essential : the method involves post - processing of a standard heterodyne output , and 1-dimensional fourier transforms are computationally simple , so a few fts suffice to identify the correct sectors ( provided the lo phase is deterministic ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting feature is that in eq.[rhetav ] the fourier term @xmath76 is unshifted by @xmath1 , unlike for the main peaks ; hence mean - time sampled rhetrodyne , the homodyne component can be fully isolated from the heterodyne sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly fig.[fig2](c ) illustrates the effect , on exactly the same measured current of ( i ) standard heterodyne ( fourier transform of the full autocorrelation function ( ii ) @xmath72-sampled heterodyne ( iii ) @xmath61 ( initial time ) sampled rheterodyne as in eq.[rhetaa ] . </S>",
    "<S> the initial - time sampled psd is harder to understand in terms of the underlying heterodyne and homodyne constituents ( while in comparison the @xmath72-sampled results combine three component spectra @xmath77 which are all independently measurable quantities ) , but its behaviour is compared with standard heterodyne in fig.[fig2](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the recovered correlations may either be isolated or shifted to interfere with the main peaks .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions _ in the present work we propose a procedure which , despite its simplicity , significantly augments the information obtained via heterodyne detection , especially as a diagnostic of dynamics which modulated the cavity output . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this extremely simple post - processing method is straightforward to realise experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> implications for quantum sensing will be explored in future work ; if useful the work may stimulate more sophisticated sampling methods which allow larger values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge helpful discussions with erika aranas . </S>"
