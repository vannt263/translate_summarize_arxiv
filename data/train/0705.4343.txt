    "a fundamental but unresolved issue with planet formation is how the mass of a giant planet is fixed . in the solar system there are four giant planets , which are characterized by their massive hydrogen / helium envelopes .",
    "jupiter and saturn consist mostly of hydrogen / helium , while uranus and neptune are mostly of ice but have significant amounts of hydrogen / helium .",
    "the giant planets are different in mass : jupiter s mass is @xmath0 , saturn s mass is @xmath1 , and uranus and neptune s masses are @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the extrasolar planets detected so far also range in mass from about one neptune mass to @xmath3 10  @xmath4 ; those planets are believed to have massive hydrogen / helium envelopes like the giant planets in the solar system .",
    "there are two competing ideas for the formation of giant planets , the core accretion model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the disk instability model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the core accretion model , a rocky / icy core first forms through collisional aggregation of planetesimals , followed by envelope formation due to substantial accretion of gas from the circumstellar ( protoplanetary ) disk . in the disk instability model ,",
    "density fluctuation of the disk gas grows to form a gaseous planet , followed by core formation due to sedimentation of heavy elements in its interior .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of both models are discussed in several literatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is not repeated here .",
    "in this paper we consider giant planet formation in the context of the core accretion model .    in the core accretion model ,",
    "the process of the accumulation of the envelopes is divided into two phases , the _ subcritical - accretion _ and _ supercritical - accretion _",
    "phases , in terms of the dominant energy source .",
    "the transition from the former to the latter occurs when the mass of a core reaches a critical value . in the subcritical - accretion phase , incoming planetesimals supply energy to the envelope so that the envelope is in the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the core accretion thus controls the gas accretion in this phase .",
    "the phase 2 found by @xcite is a part of the subcritical - accretion phase . in the supercritical - accretion phase ,",
    "the energy supplied by planetesimals is insufficient to keep the hydrostatic structure of the envelope , so that the envelope substantially contracts and releases its gravitational energy , resulting in runaway accretion of the disk gas .",
    "the supercritical - accretion phase can be further divided into two subphases . in the former subphase ,",
    "the gas accretion is controlled by contraction of the envelope and thus occurs on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale @xcite . however , because the gas accretion driven by the envelope contraction accelerates rapidly with time , the supply of the disk gas inevitably becomes unable to keep up with the demand of the contracting envelope .",
    "thus , in the latter subphase , the disk - gas supply limits the gas accretion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tw02 ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on the gas accretion in the latter subphase of the supercritical - accretion phase , i.e. , the phase in which the kelvin - helmholtz contraction of the envelope is under way but the gas accretion is limited by disk - gas supply . after the onset of the runaway gas accretion ( i.e. , in the supercritical - accretion phase ) , the planet always experiences the limited gas supply ( i.e. , the latter subphase ) by the end of its growth .",
    "although there is an idea that the masses of uranus and neptune were fixed in the subcritical - accretion phase because of dissipation of the disk gas @xcite , we will explore another possibility that the masses of those planets were fixed in the supercritical - accretion phase .",
    "one idea is that the mass of a giant planet is completely fixed when the planet opens a gap in the disk . from a physical point of view , the gap opens when the gravitational scattering by the planet overwhelms both viscous diffusion ( the viscous condition ) and push due to pressure gradient ( the thermal condition ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in normal protoplanetary disks , the final mass of a giant planet",
    "is determined by the thermal condition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is equivalent to the condition that the hill radius is equal to the disk scale height at the planet s location .",
    "the final mass is thus determined only by temperature of the disk gas for given stellar mass and planet s location . in protoplanetary disks similar to the minimum - mass solar nebula @xcite",
    ", the thermal condition yields the final mass of approximately one jupiter mass at 5  au , but predicts that the masses of giant planets increase with the semi - major axis , which is in clear contradiction to the current configuration of the solar system .",
    "furthermore , because , in reality , the gap is not vacuum but a low - density region , continuous gas accretion through the gap takes place , as suggested by several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of the subsequent accretion on the final masses of giant planets have been poorly understood .",
    "another idea is that gas accretion is truncated by depletion of the disk gas before gap opening ( e.g. , viscous dissipation and photo - evaporation of the disk gas ) .",
    "this means that the final mass of a giant planet is the total mass of the disk gas that the planet has captured until the disk gas dissipates completely .",
    "this may be responsible for the current configuration of the solar system , since it takes longer time for outer giant planets to accrete principally because of their long orbital periods .",
    "however , there have been no quantitative studies of this possibility .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to gain a systematic understanding of how the final mass of a giant planet is determined .",
    "specifically , we clarify ( 1 ) how much the mass of an accreting giant planet increases via slow , continuous accretion through the gap , ( 2 ) when and where disk dissipation dominates gap opening , and finally ( 3 ) how the final masses of giant planets depend on several disk parameters .",
    "to do so , we simulate the long - term accretion of a giant planet in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "the essential ingredients of the modeling are global viscous evolution of the disk and the flow pattern of the accreting gas , as described below ; especially , the latter effect was completely neglected by previous studies .",
    "furthermore , we derive analytical formulas for the final masses of giant planets and the boundaries between several different regimes .    during the viscous evolution of the disk ,",
    "gas radially migrates from outer regions to the site of giant planet formation . the mass flux limits gas accretion onto giant planets in some situations .",
    "because of limited cpu speed of computers , azimuthally - averaged one - dimensional simulations of the disk evolution are inevitable to follow the long - term accretion .",
    "several previous studies simulated the radial mass flux in viscously evolving disks and then calculated gas accretion rate onto giant planets . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also simply assumed that gas accretion rate onto giant planets is always proportional to the viscous mass flux .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used an approximate formula for gas accretion rate that fits the results of two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of disk gas with an embedded planet done by @xcite and @xcite . however , the formula was derived based on a limited number of numerical simulations .",
    "hence , it is in question whether the formula applies in a variety of situations .    to understand the detailed pattern of accretion flow and to obtain the gas accretion rate onto the planet , several workers ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) performed two- or three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of interaction between a planet and disk gas .",
    "since they simulated global disks , the effect of gap formation on accretion rate was automatically included . however , because of the time - consuming simulations , they did not simulate the growth of giant planets on timescales of the viscous disk evolution .",
    "this study is clearly different from the previous studies in that this study includes the effects of the flow pattern of the accreting gas in simulating long - term growth of planets embedded in globally evolving disks .",
    "to do so , we use the empirical relation between gas accretion rate and unperturbed surface density that was derived by tw02 ( see  3 for the details ) .",
    "they carried out detailed two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of gas accretion flow onto a planet .",
    "they demonstrated the importance of the local flow pattern on the accretion rate .    in this paper",
    ", we first derive an analytical formula for radial surface density distribution of protoplanetary disks with an embedded planet in  2 .",
    "next , we describe how to include the effect of the flow pattern of accreting gas , following tw02 , to calculate gas accretion rate onto giant planets in  3 . in  4",
    ", we simulate the long - term accretion of giant planets , based on the prescription given in   2 and 3 , and obtain the final masses of giant planets for wide ranges of several disk parameters .",
    "also , we derive analytical approximate formulas for the final masses of giant planets and the boundaries between several regimes . finally , we conclude this paper in  5 .",
    "we consider a planet embedded in a gas disk , both of which are assumed to rotate with the keplerian velocity around a star .",
    "we derive an approximate formula for azimuthally - averaged surface density as a function of radial distance to the central star , @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt a local coordinate system in which all quantities except the surface density are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "we assume steady states and no mass flow toward the central star .",
    "we do not consider migration of the planet .",
    "the validity of these assumptions are discussed in  [ sec_remarks ] .",
    "we employ a local coordinate system co - rotating with the planet on a circular keplerian orbit around the central star ( a local shearing - sheet approximation ) .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is the planet s position .",
    "the @xmath6 axis is on the line from the star through the planet ; the direction of the @xmath7 axis is the same as that of the velocity vector of the planet .",
    "the equation of motion of the disk gas in the @xmath7 direction in this coordinate system is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is surface density , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are velocities in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions , @xmath12 is viscosity coefficient , and @xmath13 is force acting on gas per unit mass .",
    "here we have omitted the advection term in the @xmath7 direction because of axisymmetry .",
    "we also eliminate all the terms on the left - hand side of this equation on the assumptions of steady states @xmath14 and no mass flow @xmath15 .",
    "hereafter we consider only @xmath16 because of symmetry .",
    "to derive an analytical formula for @xmath17 , we assume that @xmath11 is equal to the keplerian velocity , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the keplerian angular velocity at the planet s position .",
    "this assumption will be found to be reasonable later .",
    "equation ( [ eom - y ] ) is thus transformed into @xmath20    the gravity of the planet perturbs the motion of the disk gas .",
    "we follow the impulse prescription ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that approximates scattering of the disk gas as small - angle scattering of a particle by a point - mass object . on the prescription ,",
    "@xmath13 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the distance of the planet from the central star and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the masses of the planet and the central star , respectively .",
    "this approximation is inappropriate for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 namely , the hill radius , because this region is what is called the horse - shoe region , in which gas is not pushed away from the planet .",
    "however , since the gas in the horse - shoe region has no contribution to the accretion flow of interest ( see in  [ sec_accretion_rate ] ) , we neglect such a region .",
    "note that @xcite proposed a more elaborate formula for the torque ( a @xmath7-direction force in our formulation ) that includes the radial transfer of torque through waves , which they found in their two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "however , since the formula is unable to apply for wide ranges of the parameters , as they mentioned , we do not use their formula in this study .    substituting equation ( [ vydot ] ) into equation ( [ vy_balance ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath27   \\equiv \\sigma_{\\rm vis}(x ) , \\label{sigma_vis}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the surface density at infinity ( i.e. , far away from the planet s orbital radius ) and @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30^{1/3 }    r_{\\rm p } \\label{ell } \\\\   & = & 0.146    { \\left(\\frac{{\\nu}}{{10^{-5}r_{\\rm p}^2\\omega_{\\rm p}}}\\right)^{-1/3 } }    { \\left(\\frac{{m_{\\rm p}}}{{10^{-3}m_\\ast}}\\right)^{2/3 } }    r_{\\rm p}. \\label{ell_typical}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this surface density profile is basically the same as that derived by @xcite , except for the value of the coefficient .    the dynamical stability of the surface density profile given by equation ( [ sigma_vis ] ) must be checked using the well - known rayleigh criterion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the surface density profile to be stable , in the local coordinate system",
    ", @xmath31 must be fulfilled .",
    "the velocity @xmath11 can be obtained by solving the equation of motion for the @xmath6 component , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is sound speed . substituting equation  ( [ sigma_vis ] ) into equation  ( [ x_balance ] ) , we obtain @xmath34 , \\label{v_y_vis}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the disk scale height defined as @xmath36 . from equations  ( [ rayleigh_on_local ] ) and ( [ v_y_vis ] )",
    ", we find that condition  ( [ rayleigh_on_local ] ) is not fulfilled for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 in the region @xmath39 , the density gradient thus has to be small enough to satisfy the rayleigh condition : the density profile would be relaxed to be marginally stable for the rayleigh condition . integrating @xmath40 inward from @xmath41 we obtain @xmath42 in the region @xmath43 .",
    "substituting this into equation ( [ x_balance ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath44 for @xmath39 .    in summary ,",
    "the equilibrium profile of surface density is given as @xmath45 an example of the density profile is shown in fig.[fig_typical_sigma ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we have assumed @xmath18 in deriving equation ( [ sigma_vis ] ) .",
    "however , based on equation ( [ v_y_vis ] ) , the velocity at @xmath46 is @xmath47 this means that the maximum deviation from the keplerian shear velocity , @xmath48 , is less than 10% of the absolute value .",
    "hence the assumption of the keplerian shear velocity is reasonable for @xmath49 .",
    "finally we briefly describe the dependence of the surface density on the parameters .",
    "figure [ fig_surface_densities ] shows the surface density as a function of @xmath50 for several different values of planetary mass @xmath23 ( a ) , viscosity @xmath12 ( b ) , and scale height @xmath35 ( c ) .",
    "figures [ fig_surface_densities]a and 2b show the gap becomes deeper and wider with increasing planetary mass and decreasing viscosity .",
    "the width and depth of the gap are determined by competition between gravitational scattering by the planet and viscous diffusion of the disk gas .",
    "the gap becomes wider and deeper when planet s gravity is stronger or viscous diffusion is less efficient . from a mathematical point of view , this is because both @xmath51 and @xmath52 depends on @xmath23 and @xmath12 in the form of @xmath53 through @xmath29 .",
    "as for the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_surface_densities]c ) , all the curves are independent of @xmath35 for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 which is independent of @xmath35 ( see eq.[[sigma_vis ] ] ) . in other words , surface density in @xmath54 is determined by the balance between viscous torque and gravitational torque from the planet and has nothing to do with pressure .",
    "on the other hand , difference in surface density appears at @xmath56 , where @xmath9 is determined by the rayleigh condition ( see eq.[[sigma_r ] ] ) and thus depends on all of @xmath35 , @xmath12 , and @xmath23 through @xmath41 .",
    "in this study , we describe the gas accretion rate onto the planet , @xmath57 . through a series of local high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the gas accretion flow onto giant planets in protoplanetary disks , tw02 obtained an empirical relation between accretion rate normalized by unperturbed surface density and @xmath58 , which is the only one parameter of the local system ( see eq.[18 ] of tw02 ) .",
    "furthermore , tw02 demonstrated that only the gas in the two bands at @xmath59 accretes onto the planet .",
    "thus , writing equation ( 18 ) of tw02 in the explicit form , for @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 which is the area , the gas in which is to be accreted onto the planet per unit time ( hereafter the _ accretion area _ ) , and @xmath63 .    the reason why small @xmath35 or large @xmath23 yields high @xmath64 is explained as follows .",
    "disk gas loses its energy by passing through spiral shocks around the planet and consequently accretes onto the planet .",
    "small @xmath35 ( i.e. , small sound velocity ) or large @xmath23 ( i.e. , strong perturbation on gas motion ) yields a large mach number of the disk gas , which results in strong shocks .",
    "in addition , an increase in @xmath23 expands the planetary feeding zone , resulting in large @xmath57 .",
    "note that the position of the accretion band , @xmath65 , is located at @xmath66 in the highest - mass case of tw02 ( i.e. , @xmath67 in their notation ; see fig",
    ". 7 of tw02 where @xmath65 is shown to depend slightly on @xmath58 ) .",
    "when @xmath68 , a gap exists around the planetary orbit . in such situations ,",
    "appropriate choice of @xmath65 is crucial in determining @xmath57 because a small difference in @xmath69 makes a large difference in @xmath70 and thus @xmath57 , while choice of @xmath65 has little influence on @xmath57 in low - mass cases .",
    "that is why we adopt the value of @xmath71 for the highest - mass case of tw02 .",
    "note also that , as shown by @xcite , the gas accretion rate obtained by two - dimensional simulations are usually higher than that obtained by three - dimensional simulations .",
    "thus the accretion rate given by equation ( [ mdot ] ) could be overestimated .",
    "we will discuss this issue in ",
    "[ sec_remarks ] .",
    "in this section we show the evolution of the growth rate and mass of an accreting planet . to gain a proper understanding of the basic behavior of the planetary accretion ,",
    "we first explore two simple cases with no disk dissipation ( i.e. constant @xmath28 ) and with exponentially - decreasing @xmath28 in   [ sec_without_dissipation ] and [ sec_with_dissipation ] , respectively .",

    "finally we integrate @xmath77 with respect to time using @xmath70 and @xmath74 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ mdot ] ] ) to obtain the time evolution of the planetary mass .",
    "we first show the evolution of the planetary mass without global disk dissipation . in this case",
    "the input parameters are @xmath78 , @xmath72 , and @xmath79 .",
    "figure [ fig_nine_figures ] shows the evolution of the planetary mass and the gas accretion rate for several values of the three parameters . without global disk depletion ,",
    "the only way to suppress gas accretion is opening a deep gap around the planetary orbit by the planet itself . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_nine_figures ] , the evolution can be divided into two phases .",
    "the first phase is growth without a gap ( pre - gap phase ) , while the second phase is growth with a deep gap ( post - gap phase ) .",
    "properties of the evolution in both phases can be explained in analytical ways below .    in the pre - gap phase , @xmath57 is almost proportional to @xmath80 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_nine_figures](c),(f),(i ) ) . in this phase ,",
    "the planetary mass is insufficient to open a gap , so that @xmath81 . then we can easily integrate equation  ( [ mdot ] ) with equation ( [ adot ] ) : @xmath82 ^ 4},\\ ] ] where @xmath83 corresponds to 0.29 in equation  ( [ adot ] ) and @xmath84 is the initial mass of the planet that corresponds to the mass beyond which the gas accretion is limited by disk - gas supply .",
    "this equation implies that if @xmath70 is constant , the gas accretion rate diverges at a time @xmath85 @xmath86 corresponds to the end of the pre - gap phase . in the post - gap phase ,",
    "@xmath57 decreases with @xmath23 in an exponential fashion ( see figs .  [ fig_nine_figures](c),(f),(i ) ) .",
    "such a steep decrease in @xmath57 is due to a steep decrease in @xmath70 with respect to @xmath23 via @xmath29 , @xmath41 , and @xmath87 ( see eqs.[[sigma_vis ] ] and [ [ sigma_r ] ] ) . we can derive approximate expressions for the accretion rate in this phase , which shows @xmath57 is inversely proportional to time as shown in figs .",

    "@xcite used a formula in which the gas accretion rate onto the planet is 0.3 times the radial mass flux of the disk gas due to global viscous diffusion .",

    ", the effective disk lifetime , @xmath162 , is the shorter one of the two timescales , so that we here define @xmath163    the other limit is the total mass of the disk .",
    "this limit does not appear in fig.[fig_final_mass_contour ] ( i.e. , the case without global viscous evolution ) .",

    "[ fig_final_mass_contour_with_ss ] .",
    "this is simply because the two limits described above are more severe than the condition of @xmath124 in the cases shown in figure [ fig_final_mass_contour_with_ss ] .",
    "however , when @xmath105 is smaller , the boundary determined by @xmath166 moves rightward , so that the vertical steep boundary determined by @xmath166 emerges even in the case with global disk evolution described in this subsection .      in figure  [ fig_final_mass_contour_with_ss ] , the dependence of the final mass was shown for the normalized disk parameters .",
    "however , one might want to know its dependence on semi - major axis .",
    "we thus show the final mass as a function of semi - major axis in figure  [ fig_final_mass_vs_a - primitive ] for a typical case with @xmath167 , @xmath127 at 1au , @xmath168yr , @xmath169au , @xmath170 , which corresponds to 10 earth masses in the solar mass system , and @xmath171 , which yields a surface density roughly 0.1 times that of minimum mass solar nebula at 1au .",
    "in addition to the final mass given by equation  ( [ m_final ] ) , two kinds of the mass defined by @xmath172 are shown to clarify the limiting process for the final mass .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_final_mass_vs_a - primitive ] , the final mass ( solid line ) is determined basically by the smaller of @xmath173 ( dotted line ) and @xmath174 ( dashed line ) , although the limiting process varies with time .",

    "the final mass given by equation  ( [ m_final_gap ] ) is determined principally by @xmath12 and increases with @xmath12 .",
    "this is because larger planetary mass is required for the planet to open a gap in the case of higher viscosity . since @xmath183 and @xmath184 in our disk model , @xmath185 , which is consistent with the result shown in fig .",

    "radial mass flux due to viscous diffusion is uniform where @xmath188 , so that the final mass is usually insensitive to @xmath22 . in the case with @xmath158 , which is the case of fig .",
    "[ fig_final_mass_vs_a - primitive ] , most of the disk gas is transferred toward the central star by viscous diffusion , thus the final mass is roughly the disk mass ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath190 on the other hand , when @xmath191 , evaporation dominates viscous diffusion in disk dissipation .",
    "in this situation , the final mass at @xmath192 is given by @xmath193 note that , even when @xmath191 , the gas accretion rate onto the planet is limited by viscous diffusion .",
    "in the outer region ( @xmath194 100au ) , the final mass suddenly decreases to @xmath195 .",
    "this is because the planetary growth finishes in the pre - gap phase because of the dissipation of the disk gas ( i.e. , @xmath196 ) .",
    "we call this region the _ no - growth region_.    the positions of the boundaries between the three regions are given as follows . at the boundary between the gap - limiting region and the diffusion - limiting region ( its position being denoted by @xmath197 ) , @xmath198 . when @xmath199 , from equations  ( [ m_final_gap ] ) and ( [ m_final_diff_1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath200 here we have assumed the log factor in equation  ( [ m_final_gap ] ) is constant .",

    "the discussion above suffices to understand this figure .",
    "note that there is a hollow at @xmath3 50  au in the case where the value of @xmath135 is lower by a factor of 10 than its nominal value ( thick short - dashed line ) .",
    "this is , however , artificial . in the self - similar solution",
    "we have adopted , the direction of the radial gas flow due to viscous diffusion changes at @xmath210 , which means that the mass flux is zero at the point , and the accretion rate onto the planet is also zero accordingly ( see eq .  [ [ mdot_p_min ] ] ) . since @xmath139 increases with time ( see eq.[[tilde_tau_ss ] ] ) , the point moves outward with time .",
    "when @xmath211 , the point moves significantly with time and integration of mass flux at a particular point eliminates the effect .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath212 , the point hardly changes before the exponential depletion ; the planet around @xmath213 thus can not grow significantly .    another important aspect is on the final mass in the gap - limiting region .",
    "we can see that the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath120 agrees with that of the mass given by the viscous condition for gap opening @xcite : @xmath214 the dependence also agrees with that of @xmath180 , which is the mass when @xmath70 is @xmath215 in the case of @xmath216 ( see eq.[[m_trans ] ] ) , and re - written as @xmath217 both of the two masses indicate gap - forming masses and they agree with each other within a factor of about 2 .",
    "however the final mass shown in our model is larger by a factor of 10 than @xmath218 or @xmath219 .",
    "this is because the two masses correspond to the masses at which a gap is about to form and does not mean the masses at which growth stops .",
    "a further increase in @xmath23 after reaching @xmath220 or @xmath180 is reflected in the @xmath221 term in equation ( [ m_final_gap ] ) .",
    "we have assumed that the distribution of the disk gas around the planetary orbit ( i.e. , the surface density ) is always in the equilibrium state that is determined by the balance between viscous stress and gravitational scattering by the planet .",
    "however , for the equilibrium state to be achieved , non - equilibrium distributions must be relaxed by diffusion .",
    "the diffusion timescale , @xmath222 , is estimated by the gap width ( @xmath223 ) divided by the viscosity as @xmath224 this timescale should be compared with the typical growth timescale ( i.e. , @xmath86 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ tau_div ] ] ) .",
    "the comparison indicates that @xmath225 in most of the cases presented in this paper .",
    "hence the assumption is appropriate unless quite low viscosities ( yielding large @xmath222 ) or high surface densities ( yielding small @xmath86 ) are considered .    the empirical formula for the accretion rate based on local two - dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic simulations ( tw02 ) can be different from that derived based on more realistic simulations including , for example , three - dimensional accretion flow @xcite , non - isothermal equation of state ( tw02 ) , and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the modification would change the form of @xmath226 , which would yield quantitatively different results . however , even in that case , following our prescription given in this paper , one can easily calculate the mass evolution of planets in a similar way . the formula given by tw02",
    "can be considered as the highest limit ; thus , for example , @xmath204 is expected to shift inward if more realistic models for the accretion rate are used .",
    "we compare the accretion rate eq.[[mdot ] ] with those obtained by global simulations @xcite .",
    "although the value of our accretion rate are usually larger ( by up to a factor of 10 ) than those given by the simulations , the dependence on viscosity and planetary mass is consistent .",
    "we have not taken into account a limit in terms of geometry of the accretion flow , namely a within which equation ( [ adot ] ) is applicable .",
    "we can make a simple estimate of the maximum accretion rate if we assume all the gas within @xmath227 in @xmath228 and @xmath229 in @xmath230 accrete to the planet , where @xmath231 at @xmath232 is the point where potential energy on the rotating frame is the same as that at the lagrange points l1 or l2 . in this case , the maximum accretion rate ( normalized by surface density ) is given by @xmath233 and thus @xmath74 ( eq.[[adot ] ] ) becomes larger than the maximum value when @xmath234 although planetary mass can be larger than @xmath235 depending on the parameters , such a massive planet should already has a deep gap , so that the accretion rate is reduced greatly when the planetary mass reaches @xmath235 .",
    "consequently the geometric effect has no significant influence on the final mass .",
    "note that the discussion here is based on an approximation that streamlines can be well described by particle motions on the framework of the restricted three - body problem . since this approximation is not valid when @xmath236 @xcite , it is not applicable for small mass planet s cases .",
    "however , we consider the upper limit of applicable mass , where the planet mass is , in most cases , large enough to satisfy @xmath237 , so that the approximation is valid for the situations that we consider here .",
    "in this paper , we have put off the issue of planetary migration .",
    "since we consider a phase in which a gap exists around the planet , we may have to consider the type ii migration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially in the gap - limiting region ( e.g. , @xmath238  au in figure [ fig_final_mass_vs_a - primitive ] ) . the deep gap created by the planet blocks the accretion flow toward the central star .",
    "it follows that the planet is pushed inward by the gas exterior to the planet s orbit .",
    "inclusion of the effect of planetary migration is our future work .",
    "to gain a systematic understanding of the final masses of gas giant planets , we have simulated the long - term accretion of gas giant planets after the onset of the supercritical gas accretion in a variety of situations , depending on four disk parameters such as disk mass , viscosity , scale height , and semi - major axis .",
    "to do so , we have made a semi - analytical model to simulate the mass evolution , which enabled us to study the final mass of gas giant planets for extensive ranges of all the parameters .",
    "we have first made a 1d analytical model of the equilibrium surface density profile around a protoplanet , from consideration of the balance of torque and the dynamical stability (  [ sec_surface_density ] ) . combining the surface density profile with an empirical formula for gas accretion rate that was obtained on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations by tw02",
    ", we have obtained a formula for gas accretion rate as a function of planetary mass , viscosity , scale height , and unperturbed surface density (  [ sec_accretion_rate ] ) .",
    "we have then integrated the gas accretion rate numerically with respect to time to simulate the long - term accretion of gas giant planets (  4 ) . to understand the basic behavior of the planetary accretion , we have explored two simple cases with no disk dissipation (  [ sec_without_dissipation ] ) and with exponentially - decreasing surface density (  [ sec_with_dissipation ] ) . finally , we have simulated the long - term accretion of gas giant planets embedded in a viscously evolving and evaporating disk to obtain the final mass of gas giant planets as a function of semi - major axis (  [ sec_self - similar ] ) .",
    "we have consequently found the following three different regions depending on limiting processes on the final mass .    in the inner region ( @xmath239 ; see eqs .",
    "[ [ r_b_1 ] ] & [ [ r_b_2 ] ] ) , the planet grows quickly to form a deep gap to suppress the gas accretion from the disk by itself within the disk lifetime ( _ gap - limiting _ region ) .",
    "we have found the final mass in this region is roughly 10 times larger than that determined by the viscous condition for gap opening @xcite .",
    "this is because the condition for gap opening only expresses the condition when a gap begins to form , and is by no means equivalent to the condition that the growth is terminated .    in the intermediate region ( @xmath240 ;",
    "see eqs .",
    "[ [ r_edge_1 ] ] & [ [ r_edge_2 ] ] ) , radial transfer of the disk gas toward the planetary orbit limits the gas accretion before the planet opens a deep gap ; the final mass is thus limited by viscous diffusion of the disk ( _ diffusion - limiting _ region ) .",

    "<S> we construct an analytic model for the rate of gas accretion onto a planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk as a function of planetary mass , disk viscosity , disk scale height , and unperturbed surface density in order to study the long - term accretion and final masses of gas giant planets . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive an analytical formula for surface density profile near the planetary orbit from considerations of the balance of force and the dynamical stability . using it in the empirical formula linking surface density with gas accretion rate that is derived based on hydrodynamic simulations of tanigawa & watanabe ( 2002 , apj 586 , 506 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we then simulate the mass evolution of gas giant planets in viscously - evolving disks . </S>",
    "<S> we finally determine the final mass as a function of semi - major axis of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the disk can be divided into three regions characterized by different processes by which the final mass is determined . in the inner region , the planet grows quickly and forms a deep gap to suppress the growth by itself before disk dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the final mass of the planet in this region is found to increase with the semi - major axis in a similar way to the mass given by the viscous condition for gap opening , but the former is larger by a factor of approximately 10 than the latter . in the intermediate region , </S>",
    "<S> viscous diffusion of the disk gas limits the gas accretion before the planet form a deep gap . </S>",
    "<S> the final mass can be up to the disk mass , when disk viscous evolution occurs faster than disk evaporation . in the outer region </S>",
    "<S> , planets capture only tiny amounts of gas within the lifetime of the disk to form neptune - like planets . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytic formulae for the final masses in the different regions and the locations of the boundaries , which are helpful to gain a systematic understanding of the masses of gas giant planets . </S>"
