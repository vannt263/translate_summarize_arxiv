    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are among the most fascinating and intensively studied objects in the galaxy .",
    "they are typically populated by millions of stars , whose age , distance and chemical abundance are well known , thus making gcs the ideal benchmark to study stellar and dynamical evolution and to understand how these two apparently independent evolutionary channels can influence each other .    while the main engine of stellar evolution are stellar thermonuclear reactions , the long - term dynamical evolution of gcs",
    "is driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "the typical time - scale in which two - body processes take place in stellar systems depends on their masses and radii @xcite and for gcs it is typically significantly shorter ( 1 - 2 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than their age",
    ". therefore gcs may have experienced basically all the phases of dynamical evolution .",
    "indeed they survive the early and violent expansion triggered by primordial gas expulsion and mass loss due to stellar evolution , then they evolve toward higher central densities , eventually reaching core collapse while loosing stars through the boundary set by the tidal field of their host galaxy @xcite .",
    "because of two - body relaxation , heavier objects tend to sink toward the cluster centers ( mass segregation ) , while less massive stars are forced toward more external orbits .",
    "hence , one possible observational approach to trace the dynamical state of star clusters is to look at the radial variations of the luminosity function ( lf ) and@xmath4or mass function ( mf ) of main sequence ( ms ) stars  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this method only allows to look for the effect of mass segregation in a range of masses between @xmath5 ( the present - day mass of stars located at the ms turn - off point of gcs ) down to the mass corresponding to the limiting magnitude of observational data .",
    "because of the effect of mass segregation , the slope @xmath2 of the mf is expected to become steeper as the distance from the cluster center increases  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example in @xcite we studied the radial distribution of the mf slope in m10 .",
    "we found @xmath2 to drop from 0.7 in the center to -0.9 in the external regions .",
    "supported by n - body simulations , we interpreted this radial change of the mf slope as a clear sign of mass segregation in m10 . the obvious weakness in this approach",
    "is the need of very deep and accurate photometric measurement , even in the very central regions of the clusters where stellar densities seriously challenge the spatial resolution capabilities of even space - based observations .",
    "similarly , internal dynamics can be probed by means of massive `` test particles '' like blue straggler stars ( bsss ) , binaries and millisecond pulsars @xcite . among them",
    "bsss have been widely used for this purpose since they are relatively bright ( and hence easily observable ) and they are a typical population of any gc .",
    "@xcite have shown that the bss radial distribution can be efficiently used to rank clusters according to their dynamical age and defined an empirical tool ( `` the dynamical clock '' ) able to extract information about the dynamical state of gcs on the basis of only the position of the observed minimum in the bss radial distribution .",
    "three families have been identified in this way .",
    "_ family i _ clusters are dynamically young , not showing significant signs of mass segregation and having a flat bss radial distribution ( when properly compared to normal stars or to the sampled light ) . on the contrary , _ family ii _ and _ family iii _",
    "gcs are classified as dynamically intermediate and old , as they show bimodal and monotonically decreasing bss radial distributions , respectively .",
    "as expected , the large majority of the gcs studied so far are in a dynamically evolved state , with only a few notable exceptions ( @xmath6 centauri , ngc 2419 , palomar 14 , ngc 6101 , arp 2 and terzan 8 ; * ? ? ?",

    "in general a good agreement has been found among different indicators ( see for example beccari et al .",
    "2006 and 2013 for the cases of m62 and ngc 5466 , respectively ; dalessandro et al .",
    "2008 and bellazzini et al .",
    "2012 for ngc 2419 ) .",
    "in particular , we have recently performed a detailed analysis of the dynamical state of ngc 6101 @xcite , studying three different dynamical indicators ( the bss and the binary radial distributions and the radial variation of the lf and mf ) and we consistently found a significant lack of mass segregation in this system .",
    "opposite results from different indicators are obtained , instead , for the case of palomar 14 .",
    "in fact , based on the analysis of the radial distribution of bsss @xcite concluded that this cluster is not relaxed yet , while @xcite revealed a non - negligible variation of the mf slope across the cluster inner regions .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the two results can be reconciled with the hypothesis that the cluster was either primordially mass segregated and/or used to be significantly more compact in the past  @xcite .",
    "palomar 14 is one of the most remote gc in the galaxy ( @xmath7 kpc ) , which makes it very hard to sample the ms at masses below 0.5 m@xmath8 even with 8 m class telescopes .",
    "this fact once more suggests that the bsss are a privileged sample of test particles to study the cluster s dynamics being these massive stars more than 6 magnitudes brighter with respect to the low mass end of the ms .    in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper i ) we studied the bss population of the galactic gc ngc 5466 , finding that it shows a bimodal radial distribution with a mild central peak and a minimum located at only @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cluster s core radius  @xcite . in the framework of the `` dynamical clock '' ( ferraro et al . 2012 ) , we interpreted this feature in terms of a relatively young dynamical age .",
    "interestingly , we found that also the radial distribution of binary stars seems to display a bimodal behaviour , with the position of the minimum consistent with that of bsss . in this paper",
    "we present the first analysis of the lf and mf along the entire radial extension of ngc 5466 , obtained by combining deep high - resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations and ground - based large binocular telescope ( lbt ) data .",
    "we compare these new results with those obtained in paper i and we discuss their implication for our understanding of the dynamical state of this system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec_obs ] we describe the observations and data - analysis procedure , in section [ sec_lum ] we derive the lf and the slope of the mf of ngc 5466 at different distances from the cluster center and in section [ sec_disc ] we discuss the obtained results in the framework of the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "this work is based on the combination of deep high - resolution observations obtained with the hst advanced camera for survey ( acs ) , and wide - field images acquired with the large binocular camera ( lbc ) mounted at the lbt .",
    "the adopted reduction procedures are described in paper i , where the photometric data - set used here is referred as the `` deep sample '' ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "briefly , we used the acs images to sample the cluster ms in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands from the turn - off ( v@xmath1320.5 ) down to v@xmath14 , in the first @xmath15 from the cluster center .",
    "the deep lbc data allowed us to obtain a photometric catalog in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands sampling the ms down to comparable magnitudes in an area extending out to the cluster s tidal radius ( @xmath18 ; miocchi et al .",
    "2013 ) . in figure",
    "[ maps ] we show the position of the field of view ( fov ) of the hst and the lbt data - sets with respect to the cluster center derived in paper i. the data reduction of the whole data - set was performed through a standard point spread function ( psf ) fitting procedure , by using daophotii / allstar @xcite .",
    "we independently calibrated the acs instrumental magnitudes into the vegamag system adopting the standard procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we transformed the instrumental @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes of the lbc sample into the johnson / kron - cousins standard system by means of more than 200 stars in common with a photometric catalog previously published by @xcite .",
    "finally the @xmath11 filter was transformed into the johnson @xmath17 magnitude using the stars in common between the acs and the lbc catalogs .",
    "this provides us with a homogenous @xmath17 magnitude scale in common between the two data - sets .    in figure [ cmd_deep ]",
    "we show the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) obtained with the acs and the lbc photometric catalogs ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "as already discussed in paper i , a narrow ms is very well defined in both data - sets , witnessing the exquisite quality of the ground - based images with respect to the acs ones .",
    "the ms mean ridge lines for the two data - sets is also shown ( grey solid lines ) . in the same figure",
    "we also indicate the range of stellar masses sampled by our photometry .",
    "the transformation of the observed @xmath17 magnitudes into solar masses is done adopting the mass - to - light law of ms stars from the the best - fit isochrone of metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath19 and [ @xmath2/fe]@xmath20 from @xcite , and assuming a distance modulus @xmath21 and a reddening @xmath22 from @xcite .",
    "the same model was already used in paper i to study the radial distribution of the bss and binary fractions in ngc 5466 .",
    "the photometric completeness of the data - set is evaluated through the use artificial star experiments already described in paper i. in short , following the recipe from @xcite , a number of artificial stars with @xmath17 and @xmath23 , or @xmath17 and @xmath16 magnitudes ( depending on the data - set ) were randomly extracted from the observed lfs and spatially added to the science frame in a grid of cells of fixed width ( five times larger than the typical full with at half maximum of the stars ) in order to not introduce extra stellar crowding from the simulated stars on the images .",
    "once the artificial stars are added to the images , the photometric reduction is repeated following the same strategy adopted for the original science frames . in particular",
    ", we extracted from the catalogue of artificial stars the objects located inside a 2.5@xmath24 selection box from the ms mean ridge line .",
    "this sigma - clipping selection will be later done on the catalogue of real star , to extract bona - fide ms stars to be used to estimate the cluster s lf ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_lum ] ) .",
    "finally , the completeness is defined as the ratio between the number of simulated and recovered stars in a given magnitude bin , within the range @xmath25 and a radial distance @xmath26 from the cluster center .    in figure [ compl ]",
    "we show the photometric completeness ( @xmath27 ) of the acs and lbc data - sets ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) in seven radial regions .",
    "the acs data allow us to sample the ms with a 50% completeness ( @xmath28 ) down to @xmath29 , corresponding to a stellar mass of @xmath30 .",
    "the seeing - limited ground - based images are obviously more affected by stellar crowding even in a fairly loose gc like ngc 5466 .",
    "in particular , in the first radial annulus ( region d ) , the completeness newer reaches the 100% level and it drastically drops below 50% for stellar masses",
    "we therefore decided not to include this radial bin in the study of the cluster s mf .",
    "moreover , although the last radial bin covers a wide area , we find no significant variations in the photometric completeness and we decided to derive a unique lf in that region .",
    "we can thus assume that a single lf / mf is well representative of the entire region .",
    "hence , the lf and mf of ngc 5466 are calculated in six areas , namely a , b , c , e , f and g.",
    "to derive the lf we first selected a catalog of bona - fide ms stars , i.e. all stars with @xmath32 observed within 2.5@xmath24 from the ms mean ridge line , where @xmath24 is the combined photometric uncertainty in the two bands .",
    "the sample of stars selected in this way is mostly populated by genuine single ms stars . while a fraction of binary systems will most likely contaminate the selection , these are mostly binaries characterised by a low mass ratios , whose mass ( and light ) budget is largely dominated by the primary star  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the acs and lbc catalogs obtained from this selection contain 19,685 and 7,498 stars respectively .",
    "the lf has been obtained by counting the number of stars with @xmath32 in steps of 0.5 mag .",
    "the lower @xmath17-magnitude limit in each radial region corresponds to the value where the completeness is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "a catalogue of simulated stars from the galactic model of @xcite has been used to take into account the contamination from field stars .",
    "we properly propagated the observer photometric uncertainties to the simulated catalogue .",
    "the completeness- and field - contamination - corrected lfs determined in the six considered areas are shown in figure [ fig_mf ] .",
    "the solid lines represent the theoretical lfs obtained by multiplying a simple power - law mf of the type @xmath34 by the derivative of the mass - luminosity relationship of the best - fit isochrone ( see section [ sec_obs ] ) .",
    "with such a notation , the salpeter imf would have a slope @xmath35 , and a positive index implies that the number of stars decreases with decreasing mass .",
    "the best - fit models to the observed lfs have been determined by means of a @xmath36 statistical test , as the ones with the mf slopes yielding the lowest reduced-@xmath36 .",
    "we generated a large number of theoretical lfs using mf power - law indexes ( @xmath2 ) ranging from -2 to 2 , in steps of 0.1 .",
    "the star counts in the magnitude range @xmath37 have been used to normalize the theoretical lfs to the observed one in each annulus , while the fit was performed down to @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath39 ) in all cases .",
    "the choice of such a lower luminosity limit is mostly driven by the need of a compromise between sampling the largest range of stellar masses , while dealing with regions characterized by very different photometric completeness . in this sense ,",
    "the best - fit models in regions e and f are partially extrapolated ( in the lowest masses regime ) , while the lbc observations in region g ( the most external one ) sample a mass range that is perfectly compatible with the one covered by the acs data .",
    "the mf power - law indexes corresponding to the best - fit lf models for the six regions are , from the central area ( a ) to the most external one ( g ) : @xmath40 , with uncertainties of the order of 0.05 ( see labels in fig .",
    "[ fig_mf ] ) .",
    "this is the first time that the lf and the mf have been determined over the entire radial extension of ngc 5466 .",
    "we find that the mf slope varies only mildly from @xmath41 in the very center , to @xmath42 out to the cluster tidal radius .",
    "as shown in the left - hand panel of fig . [ fig_mf ] , the slope of the mf is essentially constant within the hst fov ( which corresponds to almost twice the core radius , @xmath43 ; @xcite ) , with only a very mild increase in the innermost region .",
    "it seems to stay constant even out to @xmath44 ( although the area between @xmath45 and @xmath46 could not be investigated with the available data - sets ) , a distance sampled by region e , which also includes the cluster half - mass radius ( @xmath47 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    quite interestingly , the mf slope measured in region e ( @xmath48 ) is in very good agreement with the value of the _ global _ mf index predicted by the relation between @xmath2 and the central concentration parameter @xmath49 shown in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , ngc 5466 has a concentration parameter @xmath50 @xcite , corresponding to a global mf index @xmath51 ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "such an agreement is indeed expected , since the actual mf near the half - mass radius should be only marginally affected by mass segregation and should therefore be representative of the global mf of the cluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . on the other hand , these values are not compatible with the global mf index @xmath52 estimated by @xcite , who used only acs data and corrected the mf for the effects of mass segregation using a set of multi - mass king models .    as we move outwards , @xmath2 ( slowly ) decreases",
    "this can be also appreciated in figure [ fig_lf ] , where the lf measured in the different regions of the acs and the lbc fovs are over - plotted . in the areas sampled by the acs data ( a , b and c ) ,",
    "the shape of the lf is the same , while in the regions covered by the lbc observations ( e , f and g ) the most external lf ( dotted line ) shows an excess in the star counts at the low - mass end , with respect to the lfs measured in the other two regions ( solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "such a behaviour in the most external bin is in agreement with what expected for a cluster moderately affected by mass segregation .",
    "the conclusion in favour of a cluster not heavily affected by dynamical evolution ( i.e. , a dynamically - young system ) is also supported by the comparison with the results that we obtained from a similar analysis performed in the gc m10 .",
    "in @xcite we studied the radial distribution of the mf slope of m10 in the same mass range considered here , and out to 5 times the cluster core radius ( @xmath53 , or @xmath54 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found that , from the center out to @xmath55 , the mf index varies as : @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the gradient of @xmath2 in m10 , defined as the absolute value of difference between its central value and the one at @xmath55 , is @xmath57 . in the case of ngc 5466",
    ", the same quantity can be calculated as the difference between the value of @xmath2 in region a ( @xmath58 , ) and that measured in region f ( @xmath59 ) , which includes the @xmath60 ( approximately @xmath61 ) distance from the cluster center .",
    "hence , in the case of ngc 5466 we obtain @xmath62 , meaning that the variation of the mf slope is more than a factor of 2 shallower in ngc 5466 than in m10 .",
    "such a comparison indicates that two - body relaxation processes worked more efficiently in shaping the mass distribution of ms stars in m10 , with respect to what happened in ngc 5466 .",
    "note that the two clusters have quite different concentrations and global mf  @xcite .",
    "so , it is possible that this difference is reflected in the observed @xmath63 variation . to test this possibility ,",
    "for both clusters we fit the surface brightness and the mf in the radial bin containing the half - mass radius ( where the mf slope should resemble the actual slope of the global mf ) using a set of multi - mass king - michie models  @xcite .",
    "these models have been constructed assuming 8 mass bins ranging from 0.1 @xmath64 to the mass at the red giant branch ( rgb ) tip and standard assumptions on the fraction of remnants  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the theoretical mf slopes have been then estimated in the same radial bins adopted in the observations and are shown in fig .",
    "[ comp ] ( open squares ) together with the observed ones ( solid circles ) .",
    "while the observed variation of @xmath2 in m10 ( grey solid circles ) is slightly steeper than what predicted by models ( grey open squares ) , the opposite is happens for ngc  5466 which appears to be under - segregated with respect the best - fit model in the same radial range .",
    "it is important to remark here that , according to  @xcite , the core binary fraction in ngc 5466 is @xmath65 , while it is only @xmath66 in m10 . in  @xcite , through a set of realistic n - body simulations , we showed that binaries play a non negligible role in the dynamical evolution of the cluster , acting as energy source that quenches the effect of mass segregation in a cluster .",
    "hence , the difference in the binary fraction in the two clusters can be at the origin ( at least partially ) of the different behaviour between the observed and the predicted radial distribution profiles of @xmath2 .",
    "nonetheless , the models shown in fig .  [ comp ] account for the different concentrations and mfs , since the same recipe for mass segregation is adopted .",
    "hence the opposite systematic deviations that the observed data show with respect to the predicted behaviours indicate an actual difference in the efficiency of mass segregation which appears to be stronger in m10 than in ngc  5466 .",
    "this result is per se not a surprise .",
    "in fact , adopting the cluster s structural parameter from  @xcite and the equations 10 and 11 from @xcite , we calculate the clusters core and half - mass relaxation times ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) to be 2.6 and 19.9 gyr for ngc 5466 , and 0.3 and 1.9 gyr for m10 , respectively .",
    "hence , the comparison of the expected evolutionary time - scales already suggests that ngc  5466 should be dynamically younger that m10 .",
    "the study proposed in this paper offers a new observational proof of the different dynamical states of the two clusters .    very interestingly",
    ", the same conclusion is obtained also from the study of the radial distribution of bsss and binary systems ( see paper i for ngc 5466 , and @xcite for m10 ) . in particular , @xcite showed that the radial distribution of bsss , normalized to that of a `` normal '' stellar population taken as proxy of the distribution of the cluster s stars , is an efficient tracer of the dynamical evolution of the hosting cluster .",
    "in fact , the position of the minimum ( @xmath69 ) of the bss radial distribution marks the distance at which dynamical friction has already been effective in segregating bsss towards the cluster centre . through the comparison among the values of @xmath69 measured in several galactic gcs , @xcite defined the so - called `` dynamical clock '' , an empirical tool able to rank gcs according to their dynamical age . in this context , in paper i we have shown that @xmath69 is @xmath9 in ngc 5466 , while it corresponds to @xmath70 in m10 @xcite .",
    "according to the dynamical clock , ngc 5466 is therefore classified as an `` early family ii '' gc , while m10 is ranked in the `` evolved family ii '' sub - class , where dynamical friction has been more effective in shaping the radial distribution of bsss .",
    "all the three different and independent dynamical indicators studied so far ( namely , the radial trend of the mf slope presented in this work , and the radial distributions of bsss and binaries studied in paper i ) therefore agree upon showing that ngc 5466 is a gc that just started to evolve dynamically .                                                                                                                                                                                                  , from the acs",
