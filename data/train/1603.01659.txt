    "the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) wireless networks are expected to provide ubiquitous services to a larger number of simultaneous mobile devices with device density far beyond the current wireless communication systems . to cope with these challenges ,",
    "ultra - dense low power nodes and cloud computing are regarded as two of the most promising techniques@xcite .",
    "leveraged on low power node and cloud computing , the cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) , first proposed in@xcite , is expected to revolutionize the architecture and operations of future wireless systems , and it has attracted considerable amount of attentions in both academia and industry@xcite@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cran_rchitecture ] , a large number of remote radio heads ( rrhs ) are densely deployed in the space domain for c - rans .",
    "each rrh is configured only with the front radio frequency ( rf ) components and some basic transmission / reception functionalities .",
    "the rrhs are connected to the baseband unit ( bbu ) pool through high - bandwidth and low - latency fronthaul links to enable real - time cloud computing .",
    "the c - rans can act as a platform for the practical implementation of coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission concepts@xcite . specifically",
    ", the bbu pool computes the beamforming weight coefficients for different rrhs , and sends the precoded data to various active rrhs .",
    "then the active rrhs cooperatively transmit the precoded data to different ues .",
    "the signals observed at each ue are superpositions of signals from multiple active rrhs .",
    "the beamforming weight coefficients are designed to steer the data to their intended receivers in the spatial domain .",
    "that is , for a given ue , the desired signals are combined coherently yet the interfering signals are combined out - of - phase . here",
    "the joint beamforming aims to improve the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) in order to significantly improve the spectral efficiency of c - rans .",
    "various beamforming designs have been studied for comp in c - rans with different optimization objectives and constraints recently .",
    "in@xcite and@xcite , the number of active front haul links is minimized under a sinr constraint for each user equipment ( ue ) and a power constraint for each rrh .",
    "the problem is solved by minimizing an approximate of the original combinatorial objective function .",
    "the works in@xcite and @xcite aim to jointly optimize the set of rrhs serving each user and the corresponding beamformers , under the constraint of front haul capacity . specifically , power minimization is studied in@xcite and sum rate maximization is considered in@xcite .",
    "the design problems in@xcite@xcite fundamentally differ from that in@xcite@xcite in that they explicitly consider the fronthaul capacity .",
    "the problem of minimizing the overall power consumption and comp operational costs by joint user association and downlink beamforming was studied in@xcite , where the problem was addressed using a mixed integer second - order cone program framework .",
    "similar problem has been studied in@xcite , where the user association and beamforming were considered in both downlink and uplink c - rans . as existing solutions considering only the downlink like@xcite can not be modified in a straightforward way to solve the problem in@xcite , efficient algorithms were proposed utilizing the uplink - downlink duality result .",
    "the dense deployment of rrhs imposes new technical challenges for the design and implementation of large scale c - rans . with the centralized processing at the bbu pool ,",
    "the power consumed by the fronthaul links that provide high - capacity connections with bbu pool becomes comparable to that for transmission@xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce power consumption of the entire network , we can reduce the number of active rrhs by putting some of the rrhs into the sleep mode .",
    "the fronthaul links of sleeping rrh will also be turned off to save power consumption .",
    "therefore , the scheduling of rrh activation plays a critical role in the development of energy - efficient c - rans .",
    "related problem has been studied in@xcite , where two efficient group sparse beamforming algorithms were proposed to obtain the subset of active rrhs and their corresponding beamformers .",
    "the works in@xcite compares the energy efficiencies of two different downlink transmission strategies in c - rans by taking the rrh transmission power , rrh activation power , and load - dependent fronthaul power into considerations .",
    "compared with the optimal exhaustive search method , the computational complexity of the algorithms in@xcite can be significantly reduced , which , however , can still be very intensive for large - scale c - rans .",
    "this is due to the fact that a series of convex problems ( e.g. sdp , socp ) have to be solved centrally using standard cvx solvers .",
    "furthermore , the aforementioned literatures are typically based on snapshot - based static models , which indicates that the stochastic and time - varying features are not considered into the formulations .",
    "therefore , only the physical layer performance metrics such as power and throughput are optimized and the resulting control policy is only adaptive to channel state information ( csi ) . in practice , delay is also a key metric to measure the quality - of - service ( qos ) , which has also been neglected in these literatures . intuitively , there is a fundamental tradeoff between power consumption and queuing delay@xcite , thus it is important to jointly consider power consumption and delay to balance their tradeoff and to meet various performance requirement in c - rans .    in practice ,",
    "the stochastic control and delay analysis are usually investigated from the queue stability perspective in a time - varying system using the lyapunov optimization technique .",
    "many existing literatures have focused on stochastic optimization for time - varying wireless networks .",
    "a fundamental approach to stochastic resource allocation and routing for heterogeneous data networks was presented in@xcite , where the flow control is crucial to ensure no network resources are wasted whenever the traffic rates are inside or outside the capacity region .",
    "the authors of@xcite investigated stochastic control for wireless networks with finite buffers , where the joint flow control , routing , and scheduling algorithms can achieve high network utility and deterministically bounded backlogs inside the network .",
    "the delay analysis was conducted in@xcite for suboptimal scheduling in one - hop wireless networks with general interference set constraints and time - correlated traffic arrivals .",
    "there also have been lots of works that focus on optimizing power under queue stability and interference constraints@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , these works generally adopt highly simplified physical - layer models for wireless channels , such as interference avoidance constraint or simple channel - rate mapping function .",
    "they do not consider the complex non - linear relationship between signal power , interference power , and system throughput as in practical systems , which makes the system design much more challenging .",
    "this paper fundamentally differs from previous works in that we consider a power minimization problem by designing queue - aware joint optimization algorithms for c - rans where both rrh activation set and beamforming vector are adaptive to queue state information and channel state information .",
    "in addition , the non - linear impacts of interence are explicitly quantified during the system design .",
    "therefore , existing solutions can not be readily applied to the c - ran setting considered in this paper .    motivated by these facts , we propose to study dynamic joint rrh activation and beamforming for c - rans by considering random traffic arrivals , queuing delays , and the time - varying fading channels . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first such work in c - rans . unlike the static optimization problems studied in the literatures , the problems considered in this paper are formulated as stochastic optimizations , which are notoriously difficult to solve but are important for practical systems .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    the stochastic optimization of joint rrh activation and beamforming is developed for practical c - rans .",
    "a wide range of detailed operations and constraints , such as beamforming , rrh activation , time - varying channel , random traffic arrivals , and fronthaul power consumption , are considered in the formulation . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first paper that achieves stochastic control of power and delay by considering realistic system operations across multiple protocol layers .    to tackle the np - hardness of the optimization problem , two low - complexity algorithms",
    "are proposed using the group sparse beamforming ( gsb ) approach and the relaxed integer programming ( rip ) approach , respectively .",
    "both algorithms can be implemented in a parallel manner with closed - form expressions , thus they are scalable to large - scale c - rans .",
    "the delay and power performance of the two proposed algorithms are numerically evaluated .",
    "significant performance gains are achieved by the proposed algorithms due to the fact that they are adaptive to the queue state information .",
    "the proposed algorithms can provide a flexible and efficient means to control the delay - power tradeoff on demand .",
    "all these make the proposed algorithms attractive and useful in practical applications .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the system model and formulate the stochastic optimization problem . in section iii ,",
    "the lyapunov optimization is introduced and utilized to obtain a penalized weighted sum rate maximization problem for each slot .",

    "it is worth noting that as we focus on the issue of power - delay tradeoff in this paper , we assume that the fronthaul links are provisioned with sufficiently high capacity and negligible latency .",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the stochastic optimization of cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) by joint remote radio head ( rrh ) activation and beamforming in the downlink . unlike most previous works that only consider a static optimization framework with full traffic buffers , we formulate a dynamic optimization problem by explicitly considering the effects of random traffic arrivals and time - varying channel fading . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic formulation can quantify the tradeoff between power consumption and queuing delay . </S>",
    "<S> leveraging on the lyapunov optimization technique , the stochastic optimization problem can be transformed into a per - slot penalized weighted sum rate maximization problem , which is shown to be non - deterministic polynomial - time hard . </S>",
    "<S> based on the equivalence between the penalized weighted sum rate maximization problem and the penalized weighted minimum mean square error ( wmmse ) problem , the group sparse beamforming optimization based wmmse algorithm and the relaxed integer programming based wmmse algorithm are proposed to efficiently obtain the joint rrh activation and beamforming policy . </S>",
    "<S> both algorithms can converge to a stationary solution with low - complexity and can be implemented in a parallel manner , thus they are highly scalable to large - scale c - rans . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , these two proposed algorithms provide a flexible and efficient means to adjust the power - delay tradeoff on demand .    cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) , lyapunov optimization , penalized weighted minimum mean square error ( wmmse ) , lagrangian dual decomposition . </S>"
