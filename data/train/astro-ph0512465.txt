    "the redshift interval from @xmath8 to @xmath9 accounts for roughly half of the age of the universe and provides a valuable baseline over which to study the final stages of galaxy assembly . from many surveys spanning this redshift range ,",
    "it is now well - established that the global star formation rate ( sfr ) declines by an order of magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting characteristic of this evolution in sfr is the fact that sites of active star formation shift from including high mass galaxies at @xmath10 to only lower mass galaxies subsequently .",
    "this pattern of star formation , referred to by @xcite as `` downsizing , '' seems contrary to the precepts of hierarchical structure formation and so understanding the physical processes that drive it is an important problem in galaxy formation .",
    "the observational evidence for the downsizing of star formation activity is now quite extensive .",
    "the primary evidence comes from field surveys encompassing all classes of galaxies to @xmath8 and beyond @xcite .",
    "however , the trends are also seen in specific populations such as field spheroidals , both in their stellar mass functions @xcite and in more precise fundamental plane studies @xcite which track the evolving mass - to - light ratio as a function of dynamical mass .",
    "the latter studies find massive spheroidals completed the bulk of their star formation to within a few percent prior to @xmath111 , whereas lower mass ellipticals continue to grow by as much as 50% in terms of stellar mass after @xmath12 .",
    "finally , detailed analyses of the spectra of nearby galaxies suggest similar trends @xcite .",
    "downsizing is important to understand as it signifies the role that feedback plays in the mass - dependent evolution of galaxies . as a consequence ,",
    "its physical origin has received much attention theoretically .",
    "recent analytic work by @xcite , for instance , suggests that the distinction between star - forming and passive systems can be understood via several characteristic mass thresholds governed by the physics of clustering , shock heating and various feedback processes .",
    "some of these processes have been implemented in numerical and semi - analytic models , including mass - dependent star formation rates @xcite , regulation through feedback by supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , most models have , until now , primarily addressed the mass distinction between star - forming and quiescent galaxies as defined at the present epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "quantitative observational measures of the _ evolving mass dependence _ via higher redshift data have not been available .",
    "this paper is concerned with undertaking a systematic study of how the mass - dependent evolution of galaxies progresses over a wide range of epochs .",
    "the goal is to quantify the patterns by which evolution proceeds as a basis for further modeling .",
    "does downsizing result largely from the assembly history of massive early - type galaxies or is there a decline in the fraction of massive star - forming systems ? in the quenching of star formation , what are the primary processes responsible and how are they related to the hierarchical framework of structure assembly as envisioned in the cdm paradigm ? does downsizing ultimately result from internal physical processes localized within galaxies such as star formation and agn feedback , or is it caused by external effects related to the immediate environment , such as ram pressure stripping and encounters with nearby galaxies in groups and clusters ?    in this paper , we combine the large spectroscopic sample contained in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite with stellar masses based on extensive near - infrared imaging conducted at palomar observatory to characterize the assembly history and evolution of galaxies since @xmath13 . our primary goal is to quantify the downsizing signal in physical terms and test its environmental dependence so that it is possible to constrain the mechanisms responsible .",
    "a plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section @xmath14[data ] presents the observations and characterizes the sample while @xmath14[methods ] describes our methods for measuring stellar masses , star formation activity and environmental density .",
    "we discuss how we estimate errors in the derived mass functions in @xmath14[mfn_description ] and present our results in @xmath14[results ] .",
    "we discuss our interpretations of the results in @xmath14[discussion ] and conclude in @xmath14[conclusions ] .",
    "where necessary , we assume a chabrier imf @xcite and a standard cosmological model with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "constraining the processes that govern downsizing requires a precise measure of the evolving stellar mass function of galaxies as a function of their physical state and environmental density .",
    "achieving this ambitious goal requires multi - wavelength observations capable of revealing quantities such as the ongoing star formation rate in a large enough cosmic volume to reliably probe a range of environments . among these requirements ,",
    "two observational components are absolutely essential : a large spectroscopic survey and near - ir photometry .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts not only precisely locate galaxies in space and time , but enable the reliable determination of restframe quantities such as color and luminosity .",
    "this in turn allows for accurate comparisons to stellar population templates which provide stellar mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath20 ) and the opportunity to convert from luminosity to stellar mass . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "relying on photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath21 ) decreases the typical precision of stellar mass estimates by more than a factor of three , with occasional catastrophic failures that lead to errors as large as an order of magnitude .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are also crucial for determining accurate environmental densities @xcite . even with the most optimistic photometric redshift uncertainties of @xmath22combo-17",
    "specifies @xmath23 @xcite  a comparison between photo-@xmath21 density measurements and the real - space density in simulated data sets gives a spearman ranked correlation coefficient of only @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 signifies perfect correlation , see * ? ? ?",
    "this uncertainty has the effect of smearing out the density signal in all but the lowest density environments in photo-@xmath21 samples . for the spectroscopic deep2 sample used in this paper , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "spectroscopic observations also provide line diagnostics that can discriminate the star formation activity occurring in galaxies . given the various timescales involved , it is useful to identify ongoing or recent star formation activity by considering various independent methods including restframe @xmath2 color , the equivalent width of [ oii ] @xmath283727 , and galaxy morphology . comparisons between the different indicators highlight specific differences between early- and late - type populations defined in different ways .",
    "in addition to spectroscopy , the second essential ingredient in this paper is near - ir photometry . as suggested by @xcite and",
    "first exploited by @xcite , near - infrared and especially @xmath1-band photometry traces the bulk of the established stellar populations and enables reliable stellar mass estimates for @xmath29 . with the addition of sed fitting from multi - band optical photometry",
    ", the uncertainty in such estimates can be reduced to factors of 23 based on @xmath1-band observations out to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the importance of @xmath1-band observations is highlighted for galaxies with @xmath31 , where the typical stellar mass uncertainty using the same technique applied to photometry with the z - band as the reddest filter would be worse by a factor of 34 ( bundy et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "uncertainties from optical mass estimates become even less secure as the redshift increases and increasingly bluer portions of the restframe sed are shifted into the reddest filter bands .",
    "thus , the combined lack of @xmath1-band photometry and spectroscopic redshifts leads to stellar mass errors greater than factors of 510 with catastrophic failures off by nearly two orders of magnitude .    because of these factors , the combination of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey with panoramic ir imaging from palomar observatory represents the ideal ( and perhaps only ) data set for tracing the evolution of accurately measured stellar masses and various indicators of star formation activity across different environments to @xmath32 .",
    "we provide details on the specific components of this data set below .      the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite utilizes the deimos spectrograph @xcite on the keck - ii telescope and aims to measure @xmath3340,000 spectroscopic redshifts with @xmath29 for galaxies with @xmath34 .",

    "we describe the salient points of this survey here and will provide further observational details in a later article ( bundy et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the palomar survey commenced in fall 2002 and was completed after 65 nights of observing in october 2005 . using contiguously spaced pointings ( each with a camera field - of - view of 86@xmath3686 ) tiled in a 3@xmath365 pattern , we mapped the central third of fields 24 to a median 80% completeness depth greater than @xmath48 , with 5 pointings deeper than @xmath49 . the imaging in fields 24 accounts for 0.9 square degrees or 55% of the palomar _ k@xmath50_-band  survey .",
    "the remainder of the data was taken in the egs where the _ k@xmath50_-band  data covers 0.7 square degrees , but to various depths .",
    "the egs was considered the highest priority field in view of the many ancillary observations  including hst , spitzer , and x - ray imaging  obtained there .",
    "as the orientation of the wirc camera is fixed on the sky and the egs traces a @xmath3345 degree strip 16  wide , to fully cover the spectroscopic field in the e  w direction requires rows of three wirc pointings .",
    "s direction requires about 12 different positions , so , in total , 35 wirc pointings were used to map the egs in the _ k@xmath50_-band .",

    "first , the average difference between the mag_auto values of a given galaxy and its corresponding magnitude measured in a 4  diameter aperture is @xmath40.03 mag fainter at the highest redshifts compared to the lowest redshifts in the sample .",
    "this effect leads to a systematic underestimate of 0.01 dex in stellar masses at high-@xmath21 compared to low-@xmath21 .",
    "in addition , mag_auto systematically underestimates the total magnitude of blue galaxies ( defined by restframe @xmath54 color , see [ u - b ] ) in the lowest redshift interval as compared to red galaxies .",
    "the magnitude of this effect , which likely results from the more extended nature of typical blue galaxies , is also @xmath40.03 mag but is not significant in the middle or high redshift intervals . considering these systematic effects contribute less than 0.01 dex to the final stellar mass estimates , we do not explicitly correct for them .",

    "magnitudes measured with aper are consistent with sextractor aperture magnitudes , and experimentation with color - color diagrams and photometric redshifts demonstrated that the 2  diameter colors exhibited the least scatter .",

    "photometric errors enter the stellar mass analysis by determining how well the template seds can be constrained by the data .",
    "larger photometric uncertainties `` smear out '' the portion of the model grid that fits an observed galaxy with high probability .",
    "this is reflected in a wider stellar mass probability distribution .",
    "additional uncertainties in the _ k@xmath50_-band  luminosity ( from errors in the observed total _ k@xmath50_-band  magnitude ) lead to final stellar mass estimates that are typically good to 0.20.3 dex .",
    "the largest systematic source of error comes from the assumed imf , in this case that proposed by @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses we derive using this imf can be converted to salpeter by adding @xmath330.25 dex , although we note this offset represents an average with a scatter across the models in our grid of @xmath330.06 dex .      in this paper , we adopt two independent approaches for identifying those galaxies that are undergoing , or have recently experienced , active star formation .",
    "the first is the restframe @xmath2 color , estimated with the same methods as in @xcite and based on the imcat photometry measured for the cfht @xmath35 data .",
    "the @xmath76-corrections , which translate observed @xmath35 colors into restframe @xmath2 values , are determined by comparison to a set of 43 nearby galaxy seds from @xcite .",
    "second - order polynomials were used to estimate @xmath2 and @xmath76-corrections as a function of observed color .",

    "we note that the proportion of red galaxies at high-@xmath21 in figure [ ub ] is in part suppressed by the @xmath37-band selection limit of @xmath78 ( selection effects are discussed in detail in @xmath14[completeness ] ) .    for galaxies with @xmath79 , the [ oii ] 3727   emission line falls within the spectroscopic range probed by the deep2 survey and this can be used to provide a second , independent estimate of the sfr . for these galaxies",

    "in addition , equation [ eq_sfr ] was optimized for a sample of compact emission line galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * ) which likely differs in the amount of extinction and typical [ oii]/h@xmath83 ratio compared to the sample here , yielding sfr estimates that could be systematically off by a factor of @xmath333 .",
    "moreover , recent work by @xcite demonstrates that sfr s based on re - radiated ir radiation can be orders of magnitude larger than optical / uv estimates , and studies of the agn population in deep2 indicate that [ oii ] emission is often associated with agn , further biasing [ oii]-based sfr estimates @xcite .",
    "future efforts , especially those utilizing the multi - wavelength data set in the egs , will be useful in refining the sfr estimates . in the present paper , we accept the limitations of equation [ eq_sfr ] for determining absolute sfr s , noting that our primary requirement is not a precision estimate of the sfr for each galaxy but only the broad division of the field population into active and quiescent subsets .",
    "in support of this last point , figure [ ub ] compares the @xmath2 and [ oii ] star formation indicators directly in the two higher redshift bins where both diagnostics are available .",
    "the solid histogram traces the full @xmath2 distribution with the vertical dashed line ( and shading ) indicating the median and 1@xmath66 range of the color bimodality discriminant ( the range results from the dependence on @xmath81 in equation [ col_lim ] ) . using the independent diagnostic of the [ oii ] equivalent width",

    "the fact that a non - zero fraction of blue galaxies is made up of the low @xmath84}}$ ] population is likely indicative of the 12 gyr timescale required for galaxies to join the red sequence and suggests that even minor episodes of star formation can lead to blue restframe colors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the median value of the measured [ oii ] sfr increases in the high-@xmath21 bin .",

    "this agreement is expected because the restframe color and sed fitting are both determined by the observed colors .",
    "such consistency demonstrates that the measured physical properties that we use to divide the galaxy population are also reflected in the best - fit sed templates that determine stellar mass ( see @xmath14[masscode ] ) .      charting galaxy evolution over a range of environments represents a key step forward that can only be achieved through large spectroscopic redshift surveys such as in the deep2 survey .",
    "@xcite rigorously investigate the question of how to provide precise environmental density estimates in the context of redshift surveys at @xmath86 .",
    "that work clearly shows , via comparisons to simulated samples , that large samples with photo-@xmath21 s are very poorly suited to providing accurate density measures in all but the most underdense environments .",
    "specifically , @xcite find that for environmental studies at high-@xmath21 , the projected @xmath87-nearest - neighbor distance , @xmath88 , offers the highest accuracy over the greatest range of environments .",
    "this measure is the field counterpart to projected density estimates first applied to studies of cluster environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the statistic is defined within a velocity window ( @xmath89 km s@xmath18 ) used to exclude contaminating foreground and background galaxies .",
    "it is therefore particularly robust to redshift space distortions in high density environments without suffering in accuracy in underdense environments .",
    "in addition , the effect of survey boundaries on @xmath88 is easily understood and mitigated by excluding a small strip around survey edges .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize the projected @xmath90-nearest - neighbor distance , @xmath7 , excluding galaxies closer than 1 @xmath91 mpc ( @xmath333 ) from a survey boundary . the choice of @xmath92 does not significantly affect @xmath88 which has a weak dependence on @xmath93 in both high and low density environments for @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the effects of survey target selection must be carefully considered because they can introduce biases as a function of redshift .",
    "@xcite find that the sampling rate and selection function in the deep2 survey equally probes all environments at @xmath12 in a uniform fashion .",
    "although the deep2 survey secures redshifts for roughly 50% of galaxies at @xmath95 , its sparse selection algorithm does not introduce a significant environment - dependent bias .",
    "however , the absolute value of @xmath7 will increasingly underestimate the true density with increasing redshift as the sampling rate declines . to handle this effect , we first convert @xmath7 into a projected surface density , @xmath96 , using @xmath97 .",
    "we then calculate the _ relative _ overdensity at the location of each galaxy by dividing the observed value of @xmath96 by the median surface density calculated in bins of @xmath98 .",
    "the relative overdensity is thus insensitive to the deep2 sampling rate , providing a reliable statistic that can be compared across the full redshift range of the sample @xcite .",
    "we note that a small bias in this statistic may be introduced by the fact that deep2 preferentially selects blue galaxies as the redshift increases .",
    "tests indicate this effect is smaller than the typical density uncertainty ( a factor of @xmath333 ) and is not likely to be important given the coarse density bins we use to divide the sample .",
    "further details are provided in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the relative overdensity for our primary sample is plotted in figure [ dens_dist ] . in the analysis that follows , we consider two ways of dividing the sample by environmental density . in the first ,",
    "we separate galaxies according to whether they lie in regions above or below the median density ( corresponding to a measured overdensity of zero in figure [ dens_dist ] ) .",
    "this is the simplest criterion but does mean the bulk of the signal is coming from regions which are not too dissimilar in their environs .",
    "in the second approach , we divide the density sample into three bins as indicated by the vertical dotted lines in figure [ dens_dist ] .",
    "the thresholds of 0.5 dex , or 0.77@xmath66 , above and below the median density were chosen to select the extreme ends of the density distribution where the field sample begins to probe group and void - like environments that are 3100 times more or less dense than average .",
    "the conclusions presented in @xmath14[results ] are not sensitive to the precise location of these three thresholds .",
    "the deep2/palomar survey presents a unique data set for constraining the galaxy stellar mass function at @xmath12 .",
    "previous efforts have so far relied on smaller and more limited samples , often without spectroscopic redshifts . only via the combination of size , spectroscopic completeness , and depth , does the current sample enable us to study the evolving relationships between stellar mass , star formation activity , and local environment in a statistically robust way .",
    "our primary tool in this effort is charting the galaxy stellar mass function of various populations .    deriving the stellar mass function in a magnitude limited survey",
    "requires corrections for the fact that faint galaxies are not detected throughout the entire survey volume .",
    "the @xmath99 formalism @xcite is the simplest technique for handling this problem but does not account for density inhomogeneities that can bias the shape of the derived mass function .",
    "while other techniques address this problem ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they face different challenges such as determining the total normalization . for sufficiently large samples over significant cosmological volumes ,",
    "density inhomogeneities cancel out and the @xmath99 method produces reliable results . considering this and the fact that we wish to use our data set to explicitly test for the effects of density inhomogeneities , we adopt the @xmath99 approach , which offers a simple way to account for both the @xmath37 and _",

    "k@xmath50_-band  limit for that particular redshift interval , and @xmath111 is the redshift at which the galaxy would no longer satisfy the @xmath37-band limit of @xmath34 .",
    "we use the sed template fits found by the stellar mass estimator to calculate @xmath110 and @xmath111 , thereby accounting for the @xmath76-corrections necessary to compute accurate @xmath99 values ( no evolutionary correction is applied ) .    in constructing the @xmath99 mass functions",
    ", we also weight the spectroscopic sample to account for incompleteness resulting from the deep2 color selection and redshift success rate .",
    "we closely follow the method described in @xcite , but add an extra dimension to the reference data cube which stores the number of objects with a given _",
    "k@xmath50_-band  magnitude .",
    "thus , for each galaxy @xmath100 we count the number of objects from the photometric catalog sharing the same bin in the @xmath42/@xmath43/@xmath112/_k@xmath50_-band  parameter space as well as the fraction of these with attempted and successful redshifts . as mentioned in @xmath14[deep2 ] ,",
    "@xmath430% of attempted deep2 redshifts are unsuccessful , mostly because of faint , blue galaxies beyond the redshift limit accessible to deep2 spectroscopy @xcite",
    ". failed redshifts for red galaxies are more likely to be within the accessible redshift range but simply lacking in strong , identifiable features .",
    "we therefore use the `` optimal '' weighting model @xcite , which accounts for the redshift success rate by assuming that failed redshifts of red galaxies ( defined by the @xmath2 color bimodality ) follow the same distribution as successful ones , while blue galaxies with failed redshifts lie beyond the redshift limit ( @xmath30 ) of the sample .",
    "the final weights are then based on the probability that a successful redshift would be obtained for a given galaxy .",
    "they also account for the selection function applied to the egs sample to balance the fraction of redshifts above and below @xmath113 . with the weight , @xmath114 , calculated in this way",
    ", we determine the differential galaxy stellar mass function :    @xmath115      to estimate the uncertainty in our mass distribution we must account for several sources of random error and model their combined effect through monte carlo simulations .",
    "different error budgets are calculated for the primary spectroscopic and photo-@xmath21 supplemented samples via 1000 realizations of our data set in which we randomized the expected errors .",
    "in both samples we model uncertainties in @xmath99 arising from photometric errors , and simulate the error on the stellar mass estimates , which , as described in @xmath14[masscode ] , is typically 0.2 dex and is encoded in the stellar mass probability distribution of each galaxy .    for the primary spectroscopic sample , errors on the rest - frame @xmath2 colors are estimated by noting the photometric errors for a given galaxy .",
    "we do not model the uncertainty in the [ oii ] sfr because unaccounted systematic errors are likely to be greater than the random uncertainty of measurements of the [ oii ] equivalent width .",
    "we stress again that these diagnostics are only used to separate the bimodal distribution into active and quiescent components .    for the photo-@xmath21 supplemented sample , we model redshift uncertainties using @xmath116 for the @xmath34 ann@xmath21 subsample and @xmath117 for the @xmath118 bpz subsample . the bpz uncertainty is slightly higher than measured in the comparison to the spectroscopic sample because we expect a poorer precision of bpz on objects with @xmath119 .",
    "these redshift uncertainties affect the distribution of objects in our redshift bins as well as the monte carlo realizations of stellar mass estimates in the photo-@xmath21 sample .",
    "the final uncertainty at each data point in the stellar mass functions from both the spectroscopic and photo-@xmath21 supplemented samples is estimated conservatively as the sum , in quadrature , of the 1@xmath66 monte carlo errors and the poisson errors .",
    "we now turn to cosmic variance .",
    "because our sample is drawn from four independent fields , it is possible to estimate the effects of cosmic variance by comparing the results from different fields in each of our three redshift bins : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath120 . for the spectroscopic sample with @xmath44",
    ", we can compare the egs to the sum of fields 2 , 3 , and 4 , yielding two subsamples with roughly equal numbers of galaxies .",
    "we compare the total and color - dependent stellar mass functions of these two subsamples and divide the median of the differences measured at all data points by @xmath121 to estimate the cosmic variance .",
    "unfortunately , galaxies with @xmath122 come only from the egs .",
    "the cosmic variance estimate here is derived by performing the same calculation on three subsets of the egs sample and dividing it by @xmath123 .",
    "of course , cosmic variance on the scale of the egs itself is not included in this estimate .",
    "for the three redshift intervals , this method provides _ average _ 1@xmath66 systematic cosmic variance uncertainties of 29% , 12% , and 26% .",
    "in addition to these rough estimates , we have checked that the observed density distribution is not affected by cosmic variance .",
    "based on the density - dependent mass functions from different fields , there is no evidence of a single structure or overdensity in one of the fields that would bias our results .",
    "we also note that the type - dependent mass functions are , to first order , affected by cosmic variance in the same way as the total mass functions .",
    "thus , while absolute comparisons between different redshift intervals must account for cosmic variance errors , comparisons using the relative or fractional abundance of a given population are less susceptible to this uncertainty .",
    "for example , comparisons between different fields of the abundance of blue galaxies at @xmath124 with masses near @xmath125m@xmath85  ( see @xmath14[results ] ) suggest that the absolute measurement is uncertain at the @xmath3340% level , while the relative measurement made with respect to the total abundance of galaxies is uncertain only at the @xmath3315% level . for red galaxies in this same bin ,",
    "the standard deviation for the relative fraction is 10% , but increases to 25% for the measurement of their absolute abundance .",
    "we now turn to the important question of the redshift - dependent completeness of the stellar mass functions in our sample .",
    "incompleteness resulting from the deep2 selection technique is corrected for by applying weights to galaxies within the spectroscopic sample , as described in @xmath14[mfn_description ] .",
    "the @xmath37 and _ k@xmath50_-band",
    "limits of this sample also introduce incompleteness effects , however , that can not be corrected through weighting . instead , we adopt two approaches to determine how the incompleteness from our magnitude limits affects the derived mass functions .",
    "first , we consider the likelihood of observing model galaxies of known mass and color based on the @xmath37 and _",
    "k@xmath50_-band  magnitude limits of the primary spectroscopic sample .",
    "we follow previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and track the stellar mass of a template galaxy with a reasonable maximum @xmath20 ratio determined by models with solar metallicity , no dust , and a burst of star formation beginning at @xmath126 that lasts for 0.5 gyr and is then truncated .",
    "we set the luminosity according to the @xmath37 and _ k@xmath50_-band  limiting magnitudes .",
    "the maximum stellar masses of these model galaxies provide estimates of our completeness limits .",
    "we consider two realizations . in the first",
    ", the model is placed at the low-@xmath21 edge of each redshift interval where the intrinsically faintest galaxies would be detected ( such galaxies have high @xmath99 weights ) . in the second ,",
    "more conservative limit , the model is placed at the high-@xmath21 edge of the interval , representing the faintest systems that could be detected across the entire redshift bin .",
    "the results indicate that the _",
    "k@xmath50_-band  limit ensures completeness above @xmath127m@xmath85  at all redshifts , while the @xmath37-band limit primarily affects our high-@xmath21 sample below @xmath128m@xmath85 .",
    "we discuss these limits in detail below .",
    "our second approach is to measure the effects of incompleteness directly by comparing our primary spectroscopic sample with @xmath34 to the fainter sample with @xmath118 , supplemented by photometric redshifts .",
    "this approach is particularly useful for investigating the way in which the @xmath37-band limit introduces a bias against red galaxies , especially at @xmath129 .",
    "this bias could mimic the effect of downsizing by suppressing the fraction of red galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "the behavior of model galaxies ( described above ) as well as the comparison to a fainter sample both yield consistent estimates for the sample completeness which we will show does not compromise our results .",
    "figure [ rk ] compares the distribution in 20 diameter @xmath130 vs total @xmath131 color - magnitude space of the primary spectroscopic sample with @xmath34 ( solid color circles ) to that for the fainter @xmath118 sample ( small black dots ) supplemented with photometric redshifts .",
    "as expected , in the low redshift bin , the majority of the @xmath118 sample is contained within the spectroscopic limit of @xmath78 ( although the photo-@xmath21 sample includes many more galaxies with @xmath34 that were not selected for spectroscopy ) .",

    "while the full range of @xmath130 colors is included in the primary sample , a color bias is introduced because the reddest galaxies are no longer detected at @xmath132 .    to demonstrate how this color bias affects the mass completeness of the sample , the left - hand panels in figure [ mass_complete ] chart the stellar mass completeness of the photo-@xmath21 supplemented sample limited to @xmath34 as compared to the full sample with @xmath118 . with increasing redshift , the fraction of galaxies satisfying @xmath34 decreases .",
    "this results in a loss of detected galaxies below a given mass which corresponds closely to the conservative limits based on model galaxies placed at the high-@xmath21 edge of each redshift interval , as described above and indicated by the dotted vertical lines in figure [ mass_complete ] .",

    "we now divide the sample by environmental density to investigate how this evolution depends on the local environment .    in figure [ mfn_col_dens ] , we plot galaxy stellar mass functions for the samples shown in figure [ mfn_tot_col ] , split into low - density environments on the left - hand side and high - density environments on the right - hand side .",

    "the absence of a strong environmental trend in the downsizing pattern of massive galaxies is a surprising result that warrants further scrutiny .",
    "although no strong dependence was seen in the fundamental plane analysis of @xcite , their density estimates were much coarser and based on photometric redshifts .",
    "local work utilizing the sdss by @xcite demonstrated differences in galaxy properties as a function of environment , but covered a much larger dynamic range in density than is accessible with our sample .",
    "we emphasize that the results of this work focus primarily on field galaxies , and , with the typical volumes probed ( @xmath3310@xmath191 mpc@xmath63 ) , only rich groups are included at the highest densities .",
    "deep2 is too small to probe cluster scales .",
    "it is important to note that individual density measurements , even in our spectroscopic analysis , can exhibit uncertainties of a factor of 3 , so there is some overlap expected between the above- and below - average density regimes in figure [ mfn_tot_col ] .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , the comparison above is inevitably dominated by galaxies near the median density ( figure [ dens_dist ] ) , and so we adopt a second , more stringent approach that divides the distribution into three , more extreme density bins . in this way , we can sample the full dynamic range of our survey .",
    "as described in @xmath14[density ] , we define a second set of density thresholds at @xmath1920.5 dex from the median density and construct mass functions for the extreme high- and low - density regimes .",
    "we plot the results in figure [ frac_densx ] , which again shows the fractional contribution of the red and blue populations to the total mass function .",
    "this time , the samples are also divided by density , with the high density points connected by solid lines and the low density points connected by dotted lines .",
    "figure [ frac_densx ] illustrates a more substantial environmental effect in the mass - dependent evolution of the sample that in each redshift interval is suggestive of local environmental trends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our observations allow us to investigate how these trends evolve with time .",
    "we find that the rise of the quiescent population and the evolution of @xmath179 appears to be accelerated in regions of high environmental density .",
    "this effect does not depend on the particular choice of the density threshold , although the differences between the two environments grow as more of the sample near the median density is excluded from the analysis .",
    "the difference in @xmath179 between these two environments is roughly a factor of 23 .",
    "we caution that interpreting the results in the high-@xmath21 bin is difficult because the effects of completeness and weighting are most important here .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath179 values in the two density regimes are more similar in the high-@xmath21 bin ( an offset of @xmath330.1 dex ) might suggest that the structural development or physical processes that lead to the density dependence at lower redshifts are not fully in place before @xmath12 .    the environmental dependence observed in figure [ frac_densx ] does not occur because of the high - density regime alone ,",
    "as one might expect given the potential presence of dense structures in the sample .",
    "the environmental effect is less strong but still apparent in comparisons between the high and middle density regimes as well as between the middle and low density regimes .    in summary , our various measures of downsizing , @xmath179 and @xmath3 ,",
    "depend strongly on redshift ( they evolve by factors of @xmath3335 across the full redshift range ) , but less so on environmental density for most field galaxies ( less than 25% ) . in support of previous inferences on the role of environment based on local studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this direct measurement of density - dependent evolution is particularly striking and serves to emphasize that galaxy mass , not environmental location , is the primary parameter governing the suppression of star formation and hence producing the signature of downsizing .",
    "figures [ mfn_tot_col ] and [ frac_col ] demonstrate a clear feature of the downsizing signal observed since @xmath12 , namely the increase in the number density of massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "although our results are consistent with previous studies which found a rise in the red galaxy abundance of a factor of @xmath426 , depending on mass @xcite , the present work represents a significant step forward not only in its statistical significance and precision by virtue of access to the large spectroscopic and infrared data set , but also in clearly defining the mass - dependent trends .    in discussing our results we begin by considering the processes that might explain the present - day population of early - type galaxies . in order to reconcile the significant ages of their stellar populations implied by precise fundamental plane studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with hierarchical models of structure formation , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others have introduced the interesting possibility of `` dry mergers''assembly preferentially progressing via mergers of quiescent sub - units .",
    "while dry mergers clearly occur @xcite , our results suggest that they can not be a substantial ingredient in the assembly history of massive quiescent galaxies .",
    "as shown in figure [ mfn_tot_col ] , the observed increase in the number of quiescent systems is almost perfectly mirrored by a decline in star - forming galaxies such that the total mass function exhibits little evolution over @xmath0 compared to that of the red and blue populations .",
    "a simple transformation of one into the other is sufficient to high precision .",
    "for example , simply interchanging the numbers of red and blue galaxies in the high-@xmath21 bin in the mass range @xmath193 , leads to a prediction for the number density in the middle-@xmath21 bin that is accurate to within @xmath3325% , well within the cosmic variance uncertainty .",
    "in addition , galaxies defined as blue or late - type with masses near @xmath3 tend to be among the reddest and least star - forming , suggesting they are likely candidates for becoming early - type systems .",
    "it is conceivable that the dry merger rate is mass - dependent and conspires to move galaxies along the mass function in a way that leaves its shape preserved .",
    "this would imply the presence of massive galaxies at low redshift that are not seen in our sample .",
    "for example , using the approximate dry merger rate estimate from @xcite of 1.3 mergers every 6.3 gyr , @xmath3325% of red galaxies would have to experience a major dry merger ( in reality , this rate , calculated over @xmath194 , might be expected to be higher at @xmath12 ) between the high-@xmath21 and middle-@xmath21 bins .",
    "if we apply this rate of assembly to the red population in our high-@xmath21 bin at @xmath195 , we find that the total mass function in the middle-@xmath21 bin at @xmath196 should be higher by approximately 60% compared to what is observed .",
    "while this one data point represents only a @xmath42@xmath66 result , similar arguments apply across the mass function and between the middle-@xmath21 and low-@xmath21 bins .",
    "more detailed modeling of the effect of merger rates on the mass function will be presented in a further paper ( bundy et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "most difficult for the dry merger hypothesis as a key feature of galaxy formation is the weak environmental dependence we observe in the downsizing signal . given a mechanism has to be found to preferentially bring quiescent sub - units together",
    ", one would expect a strong density dependence in the dry merger rate .",
    "by contrast , in our large sample it is clear that the majority of quiescent galaxies were assembled in a manner more sensitive to mass than environment .",
    "finally , our results show that downsizing is not only a feature of the star formation histories of massive quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is also apparent in the way their abundance increases .",
    "this observation is of particular interest for galaxy formation models based on the hierarchical @xmath197cdm framework . by incorporating agn feedback effects into the semi - analytic models from the munich group ,",
    "@xcite predict star formation histories for massive ellipticals that follow the downsizing trend in which more massive galaxies host older stellar populations . however , as shown in figure 5 from @xcite , these models still predict a hierarchical mass assembly history for ellipticals .",
    "the problem in comparing the predictions of @xcite to our results ( figure [ frac_col ] , for example ) is that the simulated ellipticals in @xcite are defined by their appearance at @xmath9 , not the redshift at which we observe them . while the observations presented here suggest a top - down pattern in the growing abundance of early - types , it is not yet clear how significant a problem this may be for current semi - analytic models .",
    "the results of this paper reveal important clues as to the nature of downsizing and , via a clear measurement of the trends , will assist in constraining and ruling out several of the popular explanations .",
    "a detailed comparison with such models is beyond the scope of the current paper but we discuss some of the key issues here .",
    "first we wish to dismiss a possible suggestion that our discovery of the quenching mass threshold is somehow an artifact of our selection process .",
    "for example , it might be argued that our result could arise from a uniform decrease in the incidence of star formation at all masses combined with a survey selection effect in which rare , massive objects are seen only at higher redshifts because of the larger volumes probed .",
    "our results exclude this possibility .",
    "first , our sampled volumes are relatively similar ( only a factor of @xmath334 difference between low-@xmath21 and high-@xmath21 ) , and we demonstrate that the fraction of star - forming galaxies depends not only on redshift but mass as well .",
    "figure [ mfn_evol_col ] illustrates this point . here",
    "we divide the sample into smaller redshift intervals and follow the evolution of the red and blue populations in the three largest stellar mass bins , charting the fractional contribution of the two populations to the combined mass function .",
    "the highest mass bin contains the largest fraction of quiescent galaxies at almost every redshift , and the transformation of the active population into passively - evolving systems occurs first in the high mass bin and later at lower masses .",
    "the rate of change in the incidence of star formation is clearly mass - dependent .",
    "turning now to physical explanations , we have shown in @xmath14[mq ] that the quenching mass threshold , parametrized by @xmath3 , provides a very useful description of how the fraction of star - forming galaxies evolves .",
    "the question then is what mechanism is responsible for this quenching ?",
    "can it adequately reproduce the quantitative trends observed , for example the environmental dependence ?",
    "merging may provide a starting point for answering this question and explaining the transformation of late - types into early - types .",
    "merging between disk systems has long been thought to be an important mechanism by which ellipticals form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the similar behavior of the morphological and color - defined values of @xmath3 in figure [ mtr_mq ] suggests that the same process governing the growth of ellipticals may also broadly explain the rise of quiescent galaxies in general .",
    "however , as argued above , significant merging is likely to affect the _ shape _ of the total mass function which does not appear to evolve strongly in our sample . merging may be occurring at masses below our completeness limit , but the observed evolution in the relative mix of early- and late - type galaxies suggests a process that quenches star formation first with morphological transformation following later .",
    "this would lead to higher values for @xmath3 in the morphological samples , as observed .",
    "merger - triggered quenching has further difficulties .",
    "fundamentally , the hierarchical merging of dark matter halos is expected to proceed from low mass to high mass , not the other way around .",
    "one solution to this difficulty would be to appeal to the fact that merging and assembly rates are accelerated in regions of high density ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) which also host the most massive systems . over a range of environments ,",
    "downsizing could arise naturally from the fact that massive galaxies live in these accelerated environments . however",
    ", we find no significant density dependence in the bulk of our sample ( figure [ mfn_col_dens ] ) , with downsizing appearing in all environments .",
    "this suggests that density - dependent merger rates are not the answer and that an internal feedback process on galactic scales is largely responsible for driving the downsizing pattern .",
    "many groups have recently suggested that internal agn feedback may be the missing ingredient .",
    "triggered perhaps by merging , energy deposited by",
    "the agn effectively quenches further star formation , eventually transforming late - type galaxies into early - types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are at least two current implementations of this process .",
    "in the explosive model , energy from an intense `` quasar phase '' ( usually triggered by merging ) heats and expels gas in the halo that would otherwise be available for star formation @xcite .",
    "while inspired by hydrodynamic simulations , it is not clear how the downsizing mass scale could arise from this model or what prevents future cooling of the expelled gas . in the `` radio feedback '' model , low luminosity agn energy couples to hot gas in halos with masses greater than @xmath198 in which the cooling time is longer than the dynamical time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a long - term suppression of star formation in massive halos and , on even larger scales , cooling flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models produce older stellar populations in more massive galaxies but still predict that low mass early - types ( as defined at @xmath9 ) assemble first ( see figure [ frac_col ] ) .",
    "while a possible mass scale is provided in @xmath198 that may help drive the downsizing signal , the physical mechanism that couples the radio feedback to the hot gas is not well understand . beyond simulations and formation models incorporating agn , additional evidence for",
    "the role of agn feedback comes from phenomenological studies that relate observations of black hole mass , the quasar luminosity function , and the properties of galaxies in a consistent framework ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of the physical explanation for downsizing in the star formation activity of galaxies ( and several may be necessary ) , it is clear that precise quantitative measures of the evolving mass distribution and its dependence on the basic parameters explored here will provide the ultimate test of these theories .      in this section",
    "we step back from specific models of galaxy formation and explore in a more general sense the kinds of processes that may reconcile downsizing with hierarchical structure formation . over the past decade",
    "there has been strong confirmation from many independent observations that the large - scale structure of the universe matches the basic predictions of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model in which dark matter `` halos '' harbor galaxies and grow through constant , hierarchical merging with other halos .",
    "the masses of all halos increase monotonically with time , but at every epoch , it is the largest halos that are growing most actively and that are also the last to have assembled .",
    "thus at first examination , downsizing , in which star formation proceeds from high - mass to low - mass systems , seem at odds with the cdm picture .",
    "several processes may be contributing to reversing the bottom - up trend in cdm structure formation to produce what appears to be a top - down pattern in galaxy formation .",
    "the first is a gradual effect resulting from the accelerating expansion of the universe which causes halo growth rates to slow once the universe reaches a scale factor @xmath199 .",
    "the second is the physics of gas cooling , which selects a characteristic mass scale for galaxy formation .",
    "gas can not cool rapidly , and by implication stars can not form efficiently , until structure formation produces halos with virial temperatures in excess of @xmath200  k .",
    "this sets the epoch for the onset of galaxy formation at @xmath20120 .",
    "once gas temperatures increase to @xmath202@xmath203  k , cooling once again becomes inefficient , turning off star formation in the most massive halos .",
    "this then marks the end of galaxy formation , as more and more mass builds up in group and cluster halos above this cooling limit .",
    "more detailed numerical or semi - analytic models of galaxy formation show that the cooling delay alone is insufficient to reduce star formation to observed levels , particularly in massive halos , and that other forms of feedback are required .",
    "while the details remain controversial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the net effect of this feedback is to place an upper limit on the range of halo masses over which active star formation can take place .",
    "this limit helps explain why star formation in galaxies is rarer at the present - day than it was at @xmath20412 . however , as discussed in @xmath14[origin ] , it is less obvious how to explain the observed decline in the _ mass scale _ of star - forming galaxies .    to help gain insight into this question , we can attempt to relate various galaxies in our sample to dark matter halos .",
    "models of the halo occupation distribution function predict that galaxies with the range of stellar masses sampled here ( @xmath20512 , corresponding to @xmath20611.2 ) should reside in dark matter halos of mass @xmath207@xmath208 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and furthermore that 75 - 80% of these galaxies will be `` central , '' that is the dominant galaxies within their halo , rather than satellites @xcite .",
    "these models suggest that the objects in the three mass bins in figure [ mfn_evol_col ] correspond approximately to central galaxies in galaxy , group , and cluster halos .    in the top panel of figure [ mean_age ]",
    "we show the comoving number density of halos of mass @xmath209 and 14.5 as a function of redshift ( three lines , from top to bottom ) .",
    "the numbers are roughly consistent with the comoving number densities of galaxies in our three mass bins , although the most massive stellar objects are more abundant than @xmath210 halos and may therefore reside in slightly less massive systems .",
    "the bottom panel shows the mean ages of halos in the three mass bins as a function of observed redshift .",
    "the mean age here is defined as the time elapsed since half of the halos in that mass range had first built up 90% or 50% of their current mass in a single progenitor ( solid and dashed curves respectively ) , calculated using equation 2.26 from .    by comparing figure [ mean_age ] to figure [ mfn_evol_col ] we can gain insight into the relationship between the assembly of dark matter halos and the process that drives the observed mass - dependent decline of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the fraction of the most massive blue galaxies declines from nearly 100% to @xmath3315% by @xmath8 in figure [ mfn_evol_col ] . for the least massive galaxies , this same decline lasts over the full redshift range of our sample , implying a timescale 2.5 times longer .",
    "coupled with figure [ mean_age]which indicates that the least massive halos in our sample are about twice the age of the most massive halos  this suggests a process that , for the low - mass systems , is at least 5 times slower than the growth of the dark matter halos in which they reside .",
    "since global dynamical timescales should be independent of halo mass at a given redshift , this suggests that the quenching mechanism is strongly mass - dependent with the potential for different physical processes acting in different mass ranges .",
    "using a large sample that combines spectroscopy from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey with panoramic near - ir imaging from palomar observatory , we have investigated the mass - dependent evolution of field galaxies over @xmath0 .",
    "we have constructed stellar mass functions for active and quiescent populations , defined in several ways , and divided into different samples according to accurate measures of the environmental density determined from the extensive spectroscopic data .",
    "we summarize our conclusions below :    * the mass functions of active and quiescent galaxies integrated over all environments conclusively demonstrate a downsizing signal .",
    "we quantify this by charting the evolution in a `` quenching mass , '' @xmath211 , which describes the mass scale above which feedback processes suppress star formation in massive galaxies .",
    "we find that @xmath212 with a factor of @xmath43 decrease across the redshift range probed .",
    "* the growth in the abundance of quiescent or `` early - type '' galaxies occurs first at the highest masses and then proceeds to lower mass systems .",
    "the relative abundance of early - types with @xmath213m@xmath85  has increased by a factor of @xmath43 from @xmath214 to @xmath137 , whereas the total mass function exhibits little evolution in shape and normalization ( less than 0.20.3 dex ) .",
    "this implies that early - type systems result largely via the transformation of active star - forming galaxies , indicating that `` dry mergers '' are not a major feature of their assembly history . * alternative ways of dividing active and quiescent galaxies , including the use of [ oii ] equivalent widths and hst - derived morphologies , show qualitatively similar mass - dependent evolution and quenching .",
    "interestingly , we observe that morphological evolution appears to take place on longer timescales than changes in the apparent star formation rate which operate at lower mass scales at each redshift . * for the majority of galaxies in our sample , downsizing shows little dependence on environment .",
    "an environmental signal is apparent when the extremes of the density distribution are compared . in this case , downsizing in high - density regimes appears moderately accelerated compared to low - density ones , with values of @xmath179 lower by a factor of @xmath332 .",
    "* we discuss several possibilities for the origin of downsizing based on our results .",
    "we clearly rule out a scenario in which the incidence of star formation decreases uniformly for galaxies at all masses .",
    "the weak density dependence also argues against explanations that rely on the accelerated assembly of structure in dense environments , favoring internal mechanisms instead . * through comparisons to the expected behavior of dark matter halos , we argue that the dynamical timescale resulting from the growth of structure is at least 5 times longer in galaxies hosted by halos with @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) compared to @xmath217 ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "because global dynamical scales are also independent of halo mass at a given redshift , this suggests that the quenching mechanism is strongly mass - dependent with the potential for different physical processes acting in different mass ranges .",
    "there are two obvious avenues for further studies of downsizing . in a forthcoming paper ( bundy et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we discuss the constraints on merging and the growth of galaxies determined by our observations of the total mass function .",
    "this will help dissect the role of merging in driving downsizing . in the near future , it will also be possible to chart the incidence of agn among the galaxy population and compare it to the incidence of star formation to probe the link between quenching and agn . the significant chandra follow up observations currently underway in the egs will make that field particularly exciting for such work .",
    "other efforts from the deep2 collaboration have provided new insight on environmental trends @xcite and will focus on precise measures of the evolving star formation rate ( noeske et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
