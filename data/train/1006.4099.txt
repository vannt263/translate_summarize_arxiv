    "certain properties are already used explicitely in loop calculations while others are less regarded so far or previously unknown .",

    "+ both polynomials are graph polynomials in the sense that they can be constructed directly from the feynman graph .",
    "the first symanzik polynomial @xmath0 is generated by the spanning trees of the feynman graph and it can furthermore be derived as the determinant of a minor of a so - called laplacian matrix , associated to the graph .",
    "therefore a non - trivial identity of dodgson on determinants is known to yield relations between first symanzik polynomials belonging to different graphs . using the all - minors matrix - tree theorem we derive the second symanzik polynomial from a laplacian matrix , where the external momenta are incorporated .",
    "applying dodgson s equation to the latter matrix we obtain an identity between first and second symanzik polynomials of different graphs .",
    "+ in the last section of our talk we ask for the conditions which two graphs need to fulfill to have the same first symanzik polynomial . from the correspondence between spanning trees and bases of matroids",
