    "the `` dual superconductor '' idea of confinement by t hooft and mandelstam led to significant interest in qcd monopoles , especially on the lattice .",
    "guided by motonen - olive electric - magnetic duality , seiberg and witten have solved exactly the @xmath3 susy gauge theory in 1994 , identifying properties and dynamical role of monopoles .",
    "inspired by these , we have recently suggested in @xcite that quark - gluon plasma in @xmath4 region is a liquid dominated by magnetic monopoles . in this",
    "talk we present some results : others are contained in the final talk by shuryak @xcite .",
    "different arguments for `` magnetic liquid '' were provided in @xcite .    in the past few years , quark - gluon plasma in @xmath5 region has been found to be strongly coupled , thus sqgp . among others , two major evidences",
    "include : ( i ) successful hydro descriptions of rhic measurements on radial and elliptic flows suggest a `` perfect liquid '' behavior ( see e.g. @xcite ) with low viscosity and small diffusion , which requires strong coupling among constituents ; ( ii ) lattice results for the static @xmath2 potential@xcite in this region showed very nontrivial @xmath1-dependence of the interaction absolutely beyond the perturbative expectation .",
    "below we show how in the newly suggested magnetic scenario the monopoles explain the static potential and make the `` perfect liquid '' .",
    "the static @xmath2 free energy @xmath7 both below and above @xmath8 has been calculated via lattice gauge simulations@xcite .",
    "furthermore the potential energy @xmath9 and entropy @xmath10 are also calculated via @xmath11 .",
    "linear dependence on @xmath12 , mostly in @xmath13 region , is seen in free energy up to @xmath8 .",
    "remarkably in potential energy @xmath9 , such linear dependence persists all the way to @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( and @xmath16 ) reaching values as large as 4gev at @xmath8 !",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the effective string tensions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , defined as the slopes of linear parts in @xmath7 and @xmath9 respectively , are shown in fig.[fig_static_potential](a ) . while @xmath19 vanishes at @xmath20 , @xmath21 peaks there , exceeding the vacuum string tension @xmath22 by about factor 5 !",
    "two questions have to be answered : ( i ) why @xmath21 survives to 1.3@xmath8 despite deconfinement ; ( ii ) what could be the origin of such large tension in the potential energy and entropy around @xmath8 while @xmath19 ceases out .",
    "the electric objects are not relevant as they are confined below @xmath8 and very heavy ( thus rare ) just above @xmath8@xcite , so the answers must lie in the magnetic component .     and potential energy @xmath18 from lattice results .",

    "fig.[fig_static_potential](b ) shows the current contribution from different angular momentum channel labelled by quantum number @xmath30 .",
    "the dual maxwell equation relating @xmath31 and @xmath29 requires the current to be * negative and strong enough * to self - consistently hold the flux while fig.[fig_static_potential](b ) shows only scattering in @xmath32 channels are favorable and all higher partial waves are `` bad '' for flux tube .",
    "the plasma monopoles have typical @xmath33 thus to make flux tube we need the monopoles to be dense and have @xmath34 as small as possible .",
    "we derived a quantitative condition for mechanical stability of the flux tube : @xmath35 the vanishing of @xmath21 at @xmath14 can be attributed to the saturation of the above critical condition due to dropping monopole density and rising @xmath1 .",
    "the second question is studied in @xcite .",
    "first of all we identify slow / fast process ( i.e. the process of separating @xmath2 to a finite separation @xmath36 ) with free / potential energy respectively . supercurrent of condensed monopoles which has no dissipation can not distinguish slow / fast process , while thermal monopoles have finite relaxation time and do feel the difference . at @xmath6 the originally dense condensate dies out as signaled by vanishing @xmath19 , however these monopoles become normal d.o.f and form a thermal ensemble with density @xmath23 .",
    "suppose charges are separated very fast to @xmath36 : a transverse loop drawn in between will see significant time derivative of the electric flux through it .",
    "dual faraday relation require the circulation of magnetic field @xmath37 equal to this change of flux , leading to a strong solenoidal magnetic current , as illustrated in fig.[fig_static_potential](c ) .",
    "subsequently the @xmath38 currents by thermal monopoles damp out due to collision with the bulk thermal matter , exchanging energy and generating entropy till the equilibrium . in this way",
    "large amount of heat @xmath16 is generated which is associated with this pair of charges , dissipating potential energy @xmath39 back to free energy @xmath40 which one finds for slow separation case .",
    "based on this picture we developed an analytic flux bag model and were able to relate the effective tension @xmath21 to the monopole density @xmath41 the @xmath1 dependence of the monopole density in @xmath24 is shown in fig.[fig_static_potential](d ) : the results agree well with the recent lattice results starting at @xmath14@xcite .",
    "we see monopole density increases as @xmath42 indicating they become light and dominant in plasma and presumably reach condensation point at @xmath8 , below which the density drops quickly as thermal monopoles turn into condensate .",
    "the density at @xmath43 suggests rapid increase of magnetic screening toward @xmath8 , which is also consistent with lattice results @xcite .",
    "it is important to check the consistency of the `` magnetic scenario '' for sqgp with the empirical discoveries at rhic : i.e. whether it can explain low viscosity and small diffusion constant .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations as powerful tools for studying correlation functions and transport properties in strongly coupled plasma have been used by us to explore ( to our knowledge , for the first time ) a novel plasmas made of a mixture of both electric and magnetic charges@xcite .",
    "we used standard kubo formulae to calculate the shear viscosity @xmath44 and diffusion constant @xmath45 in three settings : a pure electric plasma ( m00 ) , a mixture with 25% monopoles(m25 ) , and a 50%-50% mixture(m50 ) . in fig.[fig_viscosity_diffusion ] we show the results @xmath44 and @xmath45 as functions of the key classical coulomb plasma parameter @xmath46 for all three settings .",
    "we found that at all @xmath47 s , the most symmetric 50%-50% mixture of charges and monopoles has the smallest viscosity .",
    "the diffusion has a power law dependence on @xmath47 , for m50 we have @xmath48 . with suitable mapping from md units to physical units of sqgp",
    ", the m50 plasma is found to have viscosity and diffusion constant values very close to those exacted from rhic experiments : see transport summary fig . in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the proposed plasma with both electric and magnetic charges has the desired `` perfect liquid '' behavior .",

    "more specifically , in mixed plasma with electric / magnetic charges , we found that each charge can be trapped for long time bouncing between surrounding _ charges of the other kind_. the lorentz force leads to curling of the trajectory with decreasing radius , forcing charges and monopoles collide more often than in the gases made of only one type of particles , thus explaining the `` perfect liquid '' ( to be discussed elsewhere@xcite ) .",
