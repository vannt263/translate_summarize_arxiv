    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) consist of a white dwarf accreting from a cool companion star that fills its roche lobe and transfers matter to the primary .",
    "there are two genera of cvs , magnetic , and non - magnetic . in non - magnetic cvs ,",
    "an accretion disk is formed and a limit cycle instability in this disk ( see cannizzo et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) is the source of large scale outbursts ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 3 mag ) .",
    "however , the cv family is diverse , and not all species of non - magnetic cvs show large scale outbursts ( see warner 1995 for a taxonomy ) . in magnetic cvs ,",
    "the enormous field strength of the primary ( b @xmath11 mg ) alters the accretion process . in polars ,",
    "the accretion stream from the secondary star is captured near the secondary star and forced to follow the field lines to the photosphere of the white dwarf . there a shock is formed which emits copious quantities of x - rays .",
    "the other flavor of magnetic cv are the intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "ips are believed to have white dwarfs with lower field strengths than polars , and in the majority of such systems , accretion disks are formed that are believed to have truncated inner radii due to the rapidly spinning magnetospheres of their primaries .",
    "the orbital periods of typical cvs with non - degenerate mass donors range from about 9 hr to @xmath11 81 minutes .",
    "it is believed that all cvs evolve from longer to shorter periods .",
    "since the secondary star in a cv system is losing mass , the binary would evolve to longer periods if there was not a mechanism to shed angular momentum .",
    "the commonly invoked method is `` magnetic braking '' , in which the stellar wind of the synchronously rotating secondary star carries material ( and angular momentum ) out of the system ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) .",
    "observations of the low mass , isolated counterparts to cv secondary stars found in open clusters , however , show that the commonly invoked magnetic braking rate ( e.g. , skumanich 1972 ) , underestimates their angular velocities ( andronov et al .",
    "andronov et al .",
    "conclude that either additional sources of angular momentum loss are necessary to explain cv evolution , or the secondary stars in cvs above the period gap are evolved .",
    "one possible source for additional angular momentum loss is the torque provided by a circumbinary ( cb ) disk ( taam & spruit 2001 ) .",
    "such a structure could have formed either from material ejected during the common envelope phase of the pre - cv , or from classical novae eruptions . alternatively , many cvs with luminous accretion disks have spectra that reveal strong p - cygni profiles ( c.f . ,",
    "vitello & shlosman 1993 ) that indicate velocities sufficient to escape the system",
    ". such a wind might be able to populate a cb disk with a significant quantity of gas .    while there have been scattered reports of evidence for cb material in cvs , a uv spectroscopic survey of six bright , highly inclined cvs by belle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found no evidence for gaseous material around these systems .",
    "dubus et al .",
    "( 2004 ) conducted a mid - infrared survey for dusty cb disks in eight cv systems .",
    "while they reported detections for ss cyg and ae aqr , they found that the origin of the emission in those systems was highly variable and inconsistent with the expected behavior of cb disks .",
    "they concluded that if cb disks exist , they are either dust - free , or emit at far - ir wavelengths .    with the launch of @xmath2 , the ability to look for cool , dusty material around cvs was markedly improved .",
    "brinkworth et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reported irac ( 3.6 to 8 @xmath0 m ) observations of six polars and found five that had significant ir excesses which they proposed were possibly due to cb dust .",
    "they went on to show , however , that the amount of material implied by the putative dusty cb disks was insufficient to affect the angular momentum evolution of the observed cv systems .    if the sole source for the heating of circumbinary dust was due to irradiation by the luminosity of the typical cv system ( l@xmath12 @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath15 ) , at the innermost stable radius of a cb disk ( 1.7@xmath16 , where @xmath16 is the binary star separation ; dubus et al .",
    "2004 ) , the dust temperature would be very cool : t@xmath17 @xmath5 900 k. this would suggest that if dusty cb disks were present around cvs , the existing @xmath2 observations might not have been at long enough wavelengths to properly characterize such emission .",
    "thus , the existence of very cool dusty cb disks has not yet been fully investigated .",
    "we have used the _ herschel space observatory _ to conduct a survey of eight well - known cv systems where excess ir emission has been reported to explore the case for cool dust , or other emission processes .",
    "we combine the results of this survey with data from both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , along with ground - based observations , to fully explore their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . in the next section",
    "we discuss the observations and data sets used . in section 3",
    "we describe the results for each system , and in section 4 we discuss our conclusions .",
    "we observed the eight cv systems using the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; poglitsch et al .",
    "2010 ) on the _ herschel space observatory _ ( pilbratt et al . 2010 ) .",
    "pacs obtains photometric observations in two bands simultaneously , one blue ( 60 - 85 @xmath0 m , or 85 - 125 @xmath0 m ) , one red ( 125 - 210 @xmath0 m ) . for all of our observations we selected the bluest bandpass ( @xmath18 = 70 @xmath0 m ) , along with the default red bandpass ( @xmath18 = 160 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the preferred observing mode with pacs is the `` mini - scan map '' mode , where repeated scans of the bolometer array across the field - of - view are amassed to reduce the dominant 1/@xmath19 noise .",
    "details can be found in the pacs data reduction guide .",
    "all of our observations were identical , with scans that spanned 2.5 arcminutes , at two different orientations on the sky ( at the recommended 70@xmath20 and 100@xmath20 position angles ) .",
    "the total duration of the observations for each source was 0.9 hr , and typically reached 1@xmath21 point source flux density limits of @xmath11 1 and 3 mjy in the blue and red bandpasses , respectively .",
    "the pacs data was reduced using the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ) .",
    "reduction of mini - scan mode data is performed using the python - based data reduction template contained within hipe .",
    "since the pacs data reduction pipeline does not properly propogate errors , we have followed the recommended procedure ( popesso 2012 ) for estimating the error bars on point source fluxes ( or 1@xmath21 flux density limits ) by performing aperture photometry on numerous regions in the final processed images , and calculating the standard deviations for the resulting sets of flux densities .",
    "of the eight cvs , only am her was detected ; we list the observation log along with the 1@xmath21 point source flux densities / limits achieved with these observations in table 1 .",
    "the 70 @xmath0 m image for am her is displayed as fig . 1 .      to attempt to use the @xmath1 observations to constrain the seds of the program cvs",
    ", we have downloaded and reduced the @xmath2 and @xmath3 observations of these objects .",
    "most of the @xmath2 observations consist of irac 3.5 to 8 @xmath0 m photometry ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) and have been published elsewhere . to achieve @xmath22 flux densities for the irac , irs peak - up array , and mips 24 @xmath0 m observations",
    "we have used mopex ( makovoz et al .",
    "2006 ) . to generate light curves ,",
    "however , we have used iraf to perform aperture photometry , and used the mean flux densities derived using mopex to flux calibrate these light curves to the irac magnitude system .",
    "the @xmath3 mission ( wright et al . 2010 ) surveyed the entire sky in four wavelength bands : 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath0 m .",
    "the two short bandpasses ( hereafter referred to as w1 and w2 ) are quite similar to the two short irac bandpasses ( `` s1 '' and `` s2 '' ) .",
    "the 12 @xmath0 m channel ( `` w3 '' , @xmath18 = 11.56 @xmath0 m ) , is similar to that of the @xmath23 12 @xmath0 m bandpass , while the 22 @xmath0 m ( `` w4 '' ; @xmath18 = 22.09 @xmath0 m ) bandpass closely resembles the @xmath2 mips 24 @xmath0 m channel ( jarrett et al .",
    "2010 ) . due to the scanning nature of its orbit ,",
    "every object was observed by @xmath3 on at least twelve separate occasions .",
    "thus , it is possible to generate light curves for our program cvs using the `` single exposure '' observations from the @xmath3 mission . we have extracted these data from the irsa website ( http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/ ) with the caveat that transient effects ( e.g. , cosmic rays ) make a small number of the single exposure measurements unusable .      for most of the targets in our sample ,",
    "we have used published optical and near - ir data to construct their seds . in the case of wz sge , however , we obtained near - ir data for nearly two orbital cycles of wz sge using sqiid on the kpno 2.1 m telescope .",
    "sqiid obtains data in four near - ir channels simultaneously .",
    "the observations of wz sge occurred on 2003 april 12 .",
    "we used iraf to perform aperture photometry on wz sge and four field stars , and used the 2mass data for these field stars to calibrate the @xmath24 light curves of wz sge .",
    "the eight objects in our program were selected due to the fact they are among the brightest and closest cvs , and they have been reported as having significant infrared excesses .",
    "in addition , however , the eight cvs in our program span the main subclasses of cv systems : prototypical dwarf novae ( ss cyg , u gem ) , a short period disk dominated system ( v592 cas ) , an ultra - short period infrequently outbursting system ( wz sge ) , and four magnetic systems ( the polars am her and ef eri , and the ips ex hya and v1223 sgr ) . due to the small number of systems and their diversity",
    ", we order the following discussion based on decreasing orbital period .",
    "note : in the process of constructing the broadband seds of our program objects , we will be merging _",
    "non - simultaneous _ data",
    ". it can be dangerous to make such constructions for such highly variable objects as cvs , but they allow us to ascertain the dominant emission processes , especially any constraints imposed by the @xmath1 observations .",
    "ss cyg ( p@xmath25 = 6.603 hr ) is the prototype for long period dwarf novae . in quiescence",
    "it has v = 12.2 , and during outburst reaches v = 8.5 ( see harrison et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "harrison et al . (",
    "2010 ) have collected the mid - ir observations of ss cyg and discuss its outburst sed , including the association of the @xmath23 detections of this source ( jameson et al .",
    "1987 ) with the synchrotron jet emission inferred from radio observations ( krding et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we plot the quiescent sed of ss cyg in fig .",
    "the secondary star of ss cyg has been classified as a k5iv , which we plot as red stars in this figure .",
    "ss cyg was detected in all four @xmath3 bands .",
    "the flux from the secondary accounts for nearly all of the observed near / mid - ir flux from ss cyg . to fully model the observed sed ,",
    "however , we have summed free - free and blackbody spectral components and achieve an excellent fit to the data .",
    "this fit shows that the @xmath1 observations were almost deep enough to detect ss cyg in quiescence .",
    "the 70 @xmath0 m limit imposes a strong constraint on the lack of either cb dust emission , or on the presence of quiescent synchrotron emission .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate the origin of the free - free component used to model the sed of ss cyg , especially since we will encounter similar power law spectra for several sources , below . in outburst",
    ", observations suggest that ss cyg appears to have a sizeable wind : 4 @xmath26 10@xmath27 m@xmath28 yr@xmath15 ( froning et al .",
    "such a wind could be a significant bremsstrahlung source for hot , `` high state '' disks .",
    "however , the observations of ss cyg presented in fig . 2 correspond to quiescence , where any such wind is expected to be very weak .",
    "the more likely source of the observed free - free emission is the inner regions of the accretion disk .",
    "as shown by smak ( 1984 ) the surface density in the accretion disks of dwarf novae is on order 200 gm @xmath29 ( see schreiber & gnsicke 2002 for a specific discussion of the disk of ss cyg ) . for the geometrically thin disks expected in cvs ( e.g. , @xmath30/r@xmath31 @xmath11 0.01 , hirose & osaki 1991 ) , the mid - plane densities are high : @xmath10 10@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "since free - free emission is proportional to n@xmath34 , only the innermost regions of the accretion disk are needed to supply the flux necessary to explain the observations of ss cyg .",
    "u gem has an orbital period of 4.425 hr , and is a typical dwarf nova .",
    "harrison & gehrz ( 1992 ) reported a strong 60 @xmath0 m @xmath23 detection for u gem .",
    "in quiescence it has v = 14.6 , though it is an eclipsing system that dims to v = 15.1 .",
    "the secondary star of u gem has a spectral type of m4v ( harrison et al . 2005 ) .",
    "u gem was detected by @xmath3 in the three shorter wavelength bands .",
    "the sed of u gem is shown in fig . 3 , and is dominated by the cool secondary star .",
    "the limits imposed by the @xmath1 observations are not as tight as those for ss cyg , but still imply that any cool dust emission must have less than 1% the luminosity of the secondary star .",
    "v1223 sgr is an ip with an orbital period of 3.37 hr .",
    "harrison et al . ( 2007 ) described @xmath2 irs spectroscopic observations of v1223 sgr that suggested it is a persistent source of synchrotron emission , like its cousin ae aqr .",
    "further irs observations of v1223 sgr by harrison et al .",
    "( 2010 ) caught a large mid - ir flare from this source that they suggested must be due to a compact sychrotron source .",
    "we plot the sed of v1223 sgr in fig .",
    "4 , with data from harrison et al . ( 2010 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 observations confirm the flaring nature of this source .",
    "we plot both the quiescent w1-w3 observations ( which confirm the quiescent ir excess seen in the irs data ) , as well as the data for a flare from this source .",
    "the @xmath3 light curve for v1223 sgr suggests that this flaring event lasted for about 6 hr .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath1 observations were not quite deep enough to detect v1223 sgr , but do allow a quiescent synchrotron source that fits both the @xmath3 and irs data sets .",
    "the extrapolation of this spectrum to 8 ghz suggests that in quiescence , v1223 sgr has a flux density approaching 1 mjy , and should be easily detected with the evla .",
    "the radio flaring nature of ae aqr has long been unique among cv systems , but it is clear that there is one other ip system that appears to behave in a nearly identical fashion , at least at mid - ir wavelengths .      am her is the prototypical polar .",

    "campbell et al .",
    "( 2008a ) modeled phase resolved ir spectra with cyclotron emission from accretion in a 13.8 mg field . like all polars , am her transitions back and forth between a `` low state '' and a `` high state '' .",
    "the exact cause of these state changes in polars has not been explained . in their low states ,",
    "polars can exhibit strong cyclotron emission from optically thin harmonics . in high states the mass accretion rate in polars",
    "is believed to be a factor of 10 to 100 times higher than that in the low state . in a high state ,",
    "the cyclotron emission should become optically thick , and discrete cyclotron harmonics should not be prominent in their spectra .",

    "the flux from the secondary star has been well calibrated ( campbell et al .",
    "2008a ) , and thus can be fully accounted for in fitting the observed sed .",
    "we find that a single power law spectrum ( with f@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 ) added to the known secondary star sed explains the observations at both ends of the spectrum , from the optical to the @xmath1 detections , but fails in the near / mid - ir .",
    "a power law with this slope can be easily explained as a combination of the sum of a hot blackbody spectrum ( f@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath40 ) with a strong free - free source ( f@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath41 ) . as shown by lamb & masters ( 1979 ) ,",
    "these two spectral components are very strong in high - state polars . their relative contributions , however , depend on the magnetic field strength , the mass of the white dwarf , and the accretion rate ( for a more recent treatment , see fischer & beuermann 2001 ) .    in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "5 we present the optical / ir sed of am her in its low state ( @xmath42 data from campbell et al .",
    "there is an excess in the low state sed that is strongest in the s2 and s3 bandpasses that is also present in the high state sed .",
    "obviously , it is possible to fit this feature in either spectrum with a cool blackbody ( t@xmath17 @xmath13 700 k ) , consistent with cb dust .",
    "a clue to understanding what is going on at this wavelength , however , comes from the @xmath3 light curves of am her . in fig .",
    "6 we present those light curves along with the _ low state _ @xmath24 light curves from campbell et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , including the secondary star ellipsoidal variation models they derived for the near - ir bandpasses .",
    "the excess flux above the light curve models in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 bandpasses is due to cyclotron emission from the @xmath4 = 4 , 5 , and 6 harmonics detected ( and modeled ) in their phase - resolved @xmath24 spectra . due to the cooler plasma temperatures of the shock in the low state ( @xmath11 4 kev ) ,",
    "emission from the higher harmonics is not expected , and thus the @xmath45-band light curve is uncontaminated by such emission , and the ellipsoidal variations due to the secondary star are clearly seen .",
    "surprisingly , the high state @xmath3 light curves , though sparse , have identical morphologies to the @xmath43 and @xmath44 low state light curves !",
    "obviously , orbitally modulated cyclotron emission must be present to account for the 0.4 to 0.5 mag amplitude variations seen at the same orbital phases in the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , w1 and w2 bands .",
    "the amplitude of the modulations is even larger , @xmath8 m = 1.6 mag , in the w3 bandpass . as shown in fig . 5",
    ", the @xmath4 = 2 and 3 harmonics for the low state conditions in am her could be quite prominent , and being centered near 2.6 and 3.9 @xmath0 m , would contribute flux in the w1 and w2 bands .",
    "the @xmath4 = 1 harmonic would be centered near 7.2 @xmath0 m , and supply orbitally modulated flux in the w3 band .",
    "the highly unusual aspect of these light curves is that in the high state , it is expected that the lower number cyclotron harmonics _ should be _ completely optically thick , and thus should not contribute significant orbitally modulated flux .",

    "low _ optical depths .",
    "we conclude that while the central regions of the accretion column might become optically thick in polar high states , there must be considerable amounts of optically thin material accreting along the `` halo '' of that column .    as shown in fig .",
    "5b , the cyclotron model for a b = 13.8 mg field does not have a harmonic centered near the s3 bandpass .",
    "it is important to note that the series of cyclotron models evolved by campbell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to explain their phase - resolved spectra had a varying magnetic field strength ( 13.2 @xmath5 b @xmath46 14.1 mg ) .",
    "the issue with the `` constant@xmath47@xmath48 '' cyclotron model they used to construct the synthetic spectra is that it assumes a constant optical depth and field strength for the entire accretion column .",
    "such an assumption is unrealistic , though such models at least allow for the derivation of useful constraints on the plasma conditions in such columns .",
    "to better align the @xmath4 = 2 harmonic with the s3 bandpass requires the magnetic field to have a strength of b @xmath5 13 mg ( see the cyclotron model used for ef eri , below ) .",
    "this suggests that either the simplistic constant@xmath47@xmath48 model prescription has slightly over - estimated the magnetic field strength , or that the lower harmonic emission occurs slightly further from the magnetic pole ( where the effective field strength is lower ) than the higher harmonic emission campbell et al .",

    "the w3 , irs peak - up array ( @xmath18 = 15.8 @xmath0 m ) and mips 24 @xmath0 m photometry indicate an excess above the simple two blackbody model and may be due to dust .",
    "it also appears that the w3 photometric point is a little higher than expected when compared to the nearby data points .",
    "this deviation is probably due to the combination of the large point spread function of the @xmath3 images at this wavelength ( fwhm @xmath13 6.5 `` ) , and the fact that v592 cas has a very bright neighbor located 13 '' to the east ( 2mass j00205373 + 5542192 , @xmath44 = 9.9 , @xmath50 = 0.82 ) that dominates the w3 image ( note that @xmath3 individual scan data are not tabulated for v592 cas due to the necessity of point spread function fitting to properly extract its fluxes ) . in the irs peak - up and mips 24 @xmath0 m images the contaminating source is better separated from v592 cas , suggesting that the long wavelength excess is real . at these longer wavelengths ,",

    "such a component might arise in the strong accretion disk wind observed for this source ( see prinja et al .",

    "other than the offset in the phasing of the minima , the morphology of the s2 light curve does not closely resemble any of the published optical or high - energy light curves of ex hya .    with the precise specification of the system components",

    "we used the derived values for the masses and radii of the components in ex hya , and then used the most recent release of the wilson - divinney ( wilson & divinney 1971 ) code ( wd2010 ) to calculate a model light curve for the s2 bandpass ( see table 3 ) .",

    "the resulting light curve shows that the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star in this system can only explain about one third of the observed modulations away from `` primary eclipse '' .",
    "we also find that we need to change the phasing of the s2 light curve by @xmath56 = + 0.05 to best match the maxima and minima of this model light curve to the data .",

    "( 2002 ) that the timing of the optical minima in ex hya does not correspond exactly to binary phase 0 .",

    "the total amplitudes ( maximum light to eclipse minimum ) of the @xmath44-band and s2 light curves are identical .",
    "skidmore et al .",
    "propose that the knee is due to an eclipse of the accretion disk in wz sge , while the deeper eclipse is due to the eclipse of the hot spot ( where the accretion stream from the secondary impacts the outer edge of the disk ) .",
    "they proposed that binary phase 0 is at the center of the disk eclipse : @xmath53 = 0.954 .",

    "the resulting light curve has an identical morphology to those seen at the shorter wavelengths .",

    "if we believe that the secondary star is an l2 dwarf , and the orbital inclination is 75.9@xmath20 , than the majority of the light curve variation in these three bands is due to the ( irradiated ) ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star .",
    "note that to produce the best fit of the models to the data , we adjusted the minima of our models to occur at @xmath53 = 0.974 , closer to the center of the primary eclipse than the binary phase 0 suggested by skidmore et al .",
    "the light curve models suggest that the `` knee '' seen in the light curves might actually be due to the minimum in the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star .",
    "the amount of 3@xmath55 light we had to add to the models ( @xmath11 40% of the total flux , see table 3 ) is consistent with that required to achieve the fit to the sed .    given this result , why have we not yet conclusively detected the secondary star in wz sge ?",

    "perhaps the observed co emission is sufficient to fill in these features near @xmath53 = 0 , creating the relatively flat continuum at @xmath65 @xmath10 2.29 @xmath0 m seen in the eclipse spectrum .",

    "the sed of ef eri is presented in fig . 13 .",
    "where possible , the data in this figure are the means of the observed light curves  ef eri exhibits large variations at all wavelengths , from the @xmath66 nuv ( see szkody et al .",

    "like am her , significant emission in these lowest harmonics is not expected to be optically thin for the accretion conditions in ef eri derived by campbell et al .",
    "but there is little alternative to a cyclotron interpretation for explaining the large amplitude modulations observed in these bandpasses .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "14 that the morphology of the large scale variations slowly changes with increasing wavelength .",
    "the broad symmetric hump centered near @xmath53 = 1.05 seen in the @xmath43 and @xmath44-bands has evolved to a double - humped structure in the s2 band . by the s4 band ,",
    "the light curve shows slightly smaller amplitude ( @xmath8 m @xmath11 0.4 mag ) modulations , but with a significantly different morphology .",
    "the strongest minimum , which occurred near @xmath53 = 0.6 in the @xmath43 and @xmath44-band light curves , now occurs near @xmath53 = 1.06 in the s4 data .",
    "the onset of this feature can be first seen in the w1 light curve , getting more prominent in the s2 data , and is strongest in s4 . given the complexities inherent to cyclotron emission processes , there are a number of ways to reproduce these light curves such as a multi - polar field structure ( see buermann et al .",
    "2007 ) , a changing value of the magnetic field strength as one moves away from the magnetic pole , or a changing pitch angle of the magnetic field with increasing distance above the photosphere ( c.f .",
    ", szkody et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these effects can change the relative fluxes seen in the various harmonics , the dominant wavelength at which this emission occurs , and/or the phasing of maximum emission .    with the proposition that the w1 , s2 and s4 bandpasses are dominated by emission from the @xmath4 = 3 , 2 , and 1 cyclotron harmonics , respectively ,",
    "one of the simplest interpretations for the changing light curve morphology is an increasing optical depth . as noted above , as cyclotron harmonics become optically thick , their spectra transition from discrete humps , to a blackbody - like continuum .",
    "this change leads to a dramatic decrease in the orbitally modulated flux due to the fact that the optically thin cyclotron emission is preferentially emitted in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "as the accretion column becomes optically thick for a particular harmonic , the emission from that harmonic is radiated isotropically .",
    "thus , at those phases where we had the maximum amount of cyclotron emission in the higher harmonics , we now have reduced emission , as the lowest harmonics are partially / mostly optically thick at this phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath45-band and s4 light curves are remarkably similar . as discussed in campbell et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , the cyclotron harmonics in the @xmath45-band for ef eri are @xmath4 = 7 , 8 , and 9 . for the conditions of the shock in ef eri",
    ", these harmonics are weak and indistinct , forming a pseudo - continuum",
    ". the light curves for ef eri provide a revealing insight into the low - state behavior of polars , but a fuller understanding will require new cyclotron modeling efforts .",
    "we conclude that the sed of ef eri in the near- and mid - ir is dominated by cyclotron emission . any model for the mid - infrared spectrum of this source must incorporate the fact that there are large amplitude variations at these wavelengths that are identically phased to the cyclotron emission seen in the near - ir .",
    "we find that the ( mean ) infrared spectrum can be fitted with a single power law spectrum that extends from 1.5 to 12 @xmath0 m .",
    "since the majority of the luminosity in these bands is generated by cyclotron emission , we conclude that nearly the entire infrared luminosity of ef eri is due to accretion onto its magnetic white dwarf primary .",
    "we have used the pacs instrument on the _ herschel space observatory _ to conduct a deep survey of eight cataclysmic variables at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "the only source detected was the polar am her , which was in a `` high state '' at the time . by combining the limits derived from the @xmath1 observations with data at shorter wavelengths , we have been able to put constraints on the presence of cool dust around these objects . in every case",
    ", the derived limits suggest that any dust disks / shells around the program cvs have less than 0.1% of the quiescent luminosities of these systems .",
    "this result strengthens the conclusions of dubus et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , brinkworth et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and hoard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) : if cb disks exist , they are either of insufficient mass to affect the angular momentum evolution of cv systems , or they are dust - free .    with the @xmath1 observations in - hand , we took the opportunity to extract archived @xmath2 , and the recently released @xmath3 data , to construct seds that spanned the optical / far - ir region .",
    "the results for several of the cvs were surprising . in the case of the two polars that were observed ,",
    "the mid - ir fluxes are dominated by orbitally modulated cyclotron emission .",
    "while this might be expected for ef eri , since it was in a low state , this should not be the case for am her . in both objects , the cyclotron models that were developed to explain their phase - resolved @xmath24 spectra",
    "would not have predicted that the lowest harmonics in these two objects would be optically thin .",
    "that the @xmath4 = 1 harmonic is strong , and optically thin during the high state of am her suggests that there is significant material accreting onto the white dwarf in regions that have conditions different to those responsible for causing the bulk of the near - ir cyclotron emission .",
    "as far as we can tell , the phasing between the cyclotron emission features in the near- and mid - ir are the same , suggesting emission from the cyclotron fundamental must be located relatively close to the magnetic pole that is the source of the higher harmonic emission .",
    "thus , the scenario of a well defined accretion column with relatively uniform conditions can not be used to correctly model the cyclotron emission from polars .",
    "the vision of the accretion region in polars as patchy oval arcs , resembling the earth s auroral zone ( beuermann 1987 ) , is probably a more realistic picture . such a structure can simultaneously present a variety of viewing angles to the accreting `` column '' , gradients in the magnetic field strength , and a wide range of optical depths .    in modeling am her and ef eri , we have shown that their mid - ir fluxes can be completely explained with cyclotron emission .",
    "this suggests that the reports of excess mid - ir emission from the other polars observed by @xmath2 might be explained in a similar fashion .",
    "of the five polars with suggested mid - ir excesses in the survey by brinkworth et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the two best cases for having cb disks were ef eri and v347 pav . like ef eri , v347 pav has a low magnetic field strength ( b @xmath11 15 mg ) , and thus emission from the lowest cyclotron harmonics could explain its mid - ir excess .",
    "this is confirmed by the @xmath3 single scan light curves : the w1 and w2 photometry show @xmath67 1 mag variations over an orbit ! of the other detected polars in their sample ,",
    "the @xmath3 data show large amplitude variations for vv pup and v834 cen , while the light curves for mr ser were relatively constant ( gg leo was not detected ) .",
    "light curve data from kafka & honeycutt ( 2005 ) suggest that the 2mass observations of mr ser occurred during a high state , while the aavso data base shows that mr ser was probably in a low state in early 2005 when the @xmath2 data were obtained .",
    "such circumstances might result in an unusual sed for this object .",
    "given these results we conclude that cb dust is not necessary to explain the @xmath2 observations of polars .    wz sge has also been proposed as the host of a cb dust disk .",
    "however , the light curves from the @xmath45-band to s4 are essentially identical , suggesting that the mechanism responsible for creating these light curves changes very little over this large wavelength range .",
    "it is difficult to envision a scenario where a dusty disk could be capable of producing such a result . to attempt to explore the morphology of the light curves of wz sge",
    ", we constructed a model that assumed an l2 secondary star around the previously characterized white dwarf .",
    "much to our surprise , we found that the ellipsoidal variations from such an object can explain most of the observed light curve morphology in the @xmath44 , s2 , and s4 bandpasses . while this result is pleasing , the lack of the detection of the secondary star in wz sge remains a conundrum .",
    "our sed deconvolution suggests , however , that a dedicated campaign of @xmath44-band spectroscopy during the primary eclipse might eventually reveal this elusive object .    unlike wz sge",
    ", we could not explain the s2 light curve of ex hya as resulting from ellipsoidal variations , even with its well - constrained system parameters .",
    "it would be a useful exercise to obtain @xmath24 light curves of this object to explore the wavelength dependence of these variations .",
    "we do not believe , however , there is a need to invoke dust emission to explain this light curve , as the sed can be fitted with a simple power law .    both ss cyg and v1223 sgr",
    "have been shown to be sources of synchrotron emission .",
    "the @xmath1 observations of ss cyg strongly constrain any quiescent synchrotron emission , and thus this object probably only generates such emission during outburst . unfortunately , the @xmath1 observations were not deep enough to confirm the quiescent synchrotron emission implied by the @xmath2 observations of v1223 sgr .",
    "the @xmath3 light curves , however , show that v1223 sgr is highly variable at long wavelengths .",
    "the extrapolation of a synchrotron spectrum fit to the existing data set suggests that radio observations should easily detect v1223 sgr in quiescence .    of all of the objects in our survey , the only one for which a case might be made for cb dust emission",
    "is v592 cas .",
    "the observed excess above the simple two blackbody model is stronger than that seen in ss cyg .",
    "as noted above , however , v592 cas is known to have a very strong accretion disk wind , and it is likely that bremsstrahlung emission from this wind , or from its accretion disk , can fully explain the detected excess . as noted by hoard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , even if you consign the entire mid - infrared excess to cb dust emission , the amount of material found there would be insufficient to affect the long term evolution of this object .",
