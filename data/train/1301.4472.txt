    "[ intro ] spatially localized structures ( hereafter ls ) are observed in a great variety of pattern - forming systems .",
    "such states include spot - like structures found in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite and in a liquid light - valve experiment @xcite , isolated spikes observed in a ferrofluid experiment @xcite and localized buckled states resulting from the buckling of slender structures under compression @xcite .",
    "related states are observed in fluid mechanics , including convection @xcite and shear flows @xcite . in other systems , such as faraday waves ,",
    "the ls oscillate in time , either periodically or with a more complex time - dependence , forming structures referred to as oscillons @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for oscillons in granular media @xcite and in optics @xcite .",
    "other examples of ls include localized traveling waves @xcite and states called `` worms '' observed in electroconvection @xcite . in many of these systems the use of envelope equations removes the ( fast ) time - dependence and maps such time - dependent structures onto equilibria .    many of the structures mentioned above are examples of `` dissipative solitons '' @xcite in which energy loss through dissipation is balanced by energy input through spatially homogeneous forcing .",
    "others ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) correspond to local minima of an underlying energy or lyapunov functional .",
    "this is the case for systems whose dynamics are of gradient type , provided only that the energy is bounded from below . on finite domains with null boundary conditions",
    "such systems evolve to steady states which may or may not correspond to ls . however , in generic systems supporting dissipative solitons no lyapunov function will be present and the evolution of the system may be nonmonotonic .    in either system type , time - independent ls are found in regions of parameter space in which a time - independent spatially homogeneous ( i.e. , uniform ) state coexists with a time - independent spatially periodic state . within this region",
    "there is a subregion referred to as the _ snaking _ or _ pinning _ region @xcite in which a great variety of stationary ls are present . in the simplest , one - dimensional , case the ls consist of a segment of the periodic state embedded in a homogeneous background ; segments of the homogeneous state embedded in periodic background",
    "may be thought of as localized hole states lh .",
    "steady states of this type lie on a pair of intertwined branches that snake back and forth across the snaking region , one of which consists of reflection - symmetric ls with a peak in the center , while the other consists of similar states but with a dip in the center , and likewise for the holes .",
    "near the left edge of the snaking region each ls adds a pair of new cells , one at either end , and these grow to full strength as one follows the ls across the snaking region to its right edge , where both branches turn around and the process repeats .",
    "thus , as one follows the ls branches towards larger @xmath0 norm , both types of ls gradually grow in length , and all such structures coexist within the snaking region . on a finite interval the long ls",
    "take the form of holes in an otherwise spatially periodic state but on the real line , the ls and lh remain distinct although both occupy the same snaking region .",
    "the ls branches are , in adition , interconnected by cross - links resembling the rungs of a ladder , consisting of asymmetric ls @xcite . in generic systems posed on the real line states of this type drift , either to the left or the right , depending on the asymmetry , but in systems with gradient dynamics the asymmetric states are also time - independent .",
    "these , along with bound states of two , three , etc ls / lh are also present within the snaking region @xcite .",
    "the above behavior is typical of nonconserved order parameter fields .",
    "however , an important subclass of gradient systems possesses a conserved quantity , and in such systems the order parameter field has a fixed mean value .",
    "systems of this type arise frequently in fluid convection and other applications @xcite and are distinguished from the standard scenario summarised above by the following properties @xcite : ( i ) the snaking becomes slanted ( sometimes referred to as `` sidewinding '' ) , ( ii ) ls may be present outside of the region of coexistence of the homogeneous and periodic states , ( iii ) ls are present even when the periodic states bifurcate supercritically , i.e. , when the coexistence region is absent entirely .",
    "the slanting of the snakes - and - ladders structure is a finite size effect : in a finite domain expulsion of the conserved quantity from the ls implies its shortage outside , a fact that progressively delays ( to stronger forcing ) the formation events whereby the ls grow in length .",
    "the net effect is that ls are found in a much broader region of parameter space than in nonconserved systems .",
    "the above properties are shared by many of the models arising in dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) and related phase field models of crystalline solids . the simplest such phase field crystal ( pfc ) model @xcite ( see below ) leads to the so - called conserved swift - hohenberg ( csh ) equation .",
    "this equation was first derived , to the authors knowledge , as the equation governing the evolution of binary fluid convection between thermally insulating boundary conditions @xcite ; for recent derivations in the pfc context see refs .",
    "@xcite . in this connection",
    "the pfc model may be viewed as probably the simplest _ microscopic _ model for the freezing transition that can be constructed . in this model",
    "the transition from a homogeneous state to a periodic state corresponds to the transition from a uniform density liquid to a periodic crystalline solid .",
    "the ls of interest in this model then correspond to states in which a finite size portion of the periodic crystalline phase coexists with the uniform density liquid phase , and these are expected to be present in the coexistence region between the two phases .",
    "some rather striking examples of ls in large two - dimensional systems include snow - flake - like and dendritic structures , e.g. , refs .",
    "in fact , as shown below , the ls are also present at state points outside of the coexistence region . however , despite the application of the csh ( or pfc ) equation in this and other areas , the detailed properties of the ls described by this equation have not been investigated . in this paper",
    "we make a detailed study of the properties of this equation in one spatial dimension with the aim of setting this equation firmly in the body of literature dealing with spatially localized structures .",
    "our results are therefore interpreted within both languages , in an attempt to make existing understanding of ls accessible to those working on nonequilibrium models of solids , and to use the simplest pfc model to exemplify the theory .",
    "in addition , motivated by refs .",
    "@xcite , we also describe related results in two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensions , where ( many ) more types of regular patterns are present and hence many more types of ls .",
    "our work focuses on ` bump ' states ( also referred to as ` spots ' ) which are readily found in direct numerical simulations of the conserved swift - hohenberg equation as well as in other systems @xcite .",
    "although the theory for these cases in 2d and 3d is less well developed @xcite continuation results indicate that some of the various different types of ls can have quite different properties .",
    "for example , the bump states differ from the target - like ls formed from the stripe state that can also be seen in the model . in particular , spots in the nonconserved swift - hohenberg equation in the plane bifurcate from the homogeneous state regardless of whether stripes are subcritical or supercritical @xcite , see also ref .",
    "the key question , hitherto unanswered , is whether two - dimensional structures in the plane snake indefinitely and likewise for three - dimensional structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the conserved swift - hohenberg equation and its basic properties . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the properties of ls in one spatial dimension as determined by numerical continuation . in sec .",
    "iv we describe related results in two and three spatial dimensions , but obtained by direct numerical simulation of the pfc model .",
    "since this model has a gradient structure , on a finite domain all solutions necessarily approach a time - independent equilibrium .",
    "however , as we shall see , the number of competing equilibria may be very large and different equilibria are reached depending on the initial conditions employed . in sec .",
