    "quite analogous to equilibrium systems close to their critical point , growth processes exhibit statistical self - similarity and scaling .",
    "their theoretical investigation is a continuing enterprise for a variety of reasons .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental one is that statistical self - similarity emerges from the dynamical rules without any particular fine - tuning , which is believed to be a basic characteristic of many nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the persisting theoretical challenge is to develop renormalization group type methods which have been so powerful in the understanding of equilibrium critical phenomena .    in the context of kpz theory @xcite most of the recent efforts",
    "have concentrated on scaling exponents and in particular on the question of an upper critical dimension @xcite . in this note",
    "we will focus on the full height distribution at one point above the substrate .",
    "in addition we will restrict ourselves to one - dimensional growth processes , where _ static _ fluctuations are the same as in equilibrium due to a fluctuation - dissipation property , i.e. the roughness exponent is known to be @xmath0 .    the most commonly adopted set - up",
    "is to start from a flat substrate , i.e. , if @xmath1 denotes the height above @xmath2 at time @xmath3 , then initially @xmath4 with slope @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath6 , is random through the dynamical rules which will have to be specified for a concrete model .",
    "the slope @xmath5 is a locally conserved quantity . by translation invariance",
    ", @xmath7 has a distribution independent of @xmath8 and we may consider the height @xmath9 above the origin . for large times it will increase linearly with time with a slope dependent growth velocity @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 fluctuates on the scale @xmath12 .",
    "therefore @xmath13 for large @xmath3 .",
    "the random variable @xmath14 is of order one and independent of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : flatscalingform ] ) should be viewed in analogy to the central limit theorem for a random walk with independent increments . in that case",
    "@xmath10 would be the average drift , the fluctuations diffusive on the scale @xmath15 , and @xmath14 a standard gaussian random variable .    following krug _ et al _ @xcite , the prefactor @xmath16 depends only on macroscopic properties of the growth model , namely the leading nonlinear part of the slope dependent growth velocity , @xmath17 , and the static susceptibility or roughness amplitude , @xmath18 with limits in this order .",
    "on dimensional grounds we must have then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a dimensionless number , independent of @xmath5 , fixing the absolute scale of @xmath14 .",
    "et al _ @xcite have studied @xmath14 on the level of moments for a variety of growth models , thereby strongly supporting the claim that the scaling form ( [ eq : flatscalingform ] ) together with ( [ eq : coefficient ] ) is the same for all growth models in the kpz universality class .    in the very early studies on growth models , like the eden model , one started with a single seed at the origin to have a cluster growing through irreversible aggregation .",
    "for large times the droplet grows then self - similarly with a shape depending on the particular dynamical rule .",
    "in fact the macroscopic shape is determined through the slope dependent growth velocity by the wulff construction , i.e. growth velocity and shape are related as surface tension and crystal shape in equilibrium .",
    "thus , as for a flat substrate , in the droplet geometry there is self - similar growth , but now with a ( macroscopically ) non - vanishing curvature .",
    "the analogue of ( [ eq : flatscalingform ] ) is the distance of the surface from the origin along a given ray and it is natural to expect for it the scaling form @xmath21 with some universal random variable @xmath22 .",
    "the main part of our note studies the shape fluctuations ( [ eq : dropletscalingform ] ) in the droplet geometry . in section [ sec : droplet ] we show that for the polynuclear growth ( png ) model ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) @xmath22 has the tracy - widom ( tw ) distribution appearing in the theory of random matrices .",
    "we give some numerical and analytical support for the universality hypothesis .",
    "in addition , we clearly demonstrate that @xmath23 .",
    "thus for self - similar growth with zero noise initial conditions there are two distinct classes , flat substrate ( zero curvature ) and droplet ( non - zero curvature ) . in both geometries",
    "the height has the scaling form ( [ eq : flatscalingform ] ) , resp .",
    "( [ eq : dropletscalingform ] ) , but the universal random variables @xmath14 and @xmath22 have different distributions .",
    "the png model describes a crystal growing layer by layer on a one - dimensional substrate through random deposition of particles .",
    "they nucleate on existing plateaus of the crystal forming new islands . in an idealization",
    "these islands spread laterally with constant speed by steady condensation of further material at the edges of the islands .",
    "adjacent islands of the same level coalesce upon meeting and on top of the new levels further islands emerge .",
    "nucleation events occur independently and uniformly in space - time .",
    "given the space - time coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , of such an event , the corresponding island nucleates in level @xmath27 in units of transverse lattice spacings .",
    "we also choose the time unit such that the lateral growth speed equals one . to determine the height @xmath1 we note that it depends only on the nucleation events in the backward light cone of @xmath28 .",
    "we label them as @xmath29 , @xmath30 . then @xmath31 according to ( [ eq : whichlevel ] ) , and @xmath1 is obtained as the maximum over all @xmath32 in the backward light cone , @xmath33 with the rule that @xmath34 if there is no such nucleation event .",
    "( [ eq : detlevel ] ) and ( [ eq : height ] ) together define recursively all @xmath32 and therefore @xmath1 .    for droplet growth on the initially flat substrate ,",
    "a single island starts spreading from the origin and further nucleations take place only above this ground layer which we define to have zero height .",
    "we want to study the probability distribution of @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 . clearly @xmath1 is determined by the set of nucleation events inside the rectangle @xmath38 . in",
    "light - like coordinates , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the rectangle @xmath41 equals @xmath42\\times[0,v]$ ] with @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the nucleation events in @xmath41 are poisson distributed with density one .",
    "we label them as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 random , such that @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding order in the second coordinate @xmath49 , @xmath50 , defines then ( with probability one ) a permutation @xmath51 of length @xmath47 , compare with figure 1 . in order to distinguish nucleation events corresponding to different height levels , we partition @xmath52 into decreasing subsequences according to the following algorithm . for the first subsequence one",
    "starts with the first entry in the tuple and , scanning from left to right , one adds an entry to the subsequence if it is smaller than the so far last entry in this subsequence .",
    "every used entry is marked as deleted .",
    "when the end of the tuple is reached the first subsequence is completed .",
    "this procedure is repeated to obtain further subsequences by using only the undeleted entries of the original tuple . as a result",
    "the permutation @xmath51 is partitioned into decreasing subsequences .",
    "the nucleation events of each such subsequence are on the same height level and distinct subsequences correspond to distinct heights .",
    "the space - time height lines , across which @xmath53 increases by one unit , are thus constructed by connecting the nucleation events belonging to the same subsequence by a zigzag line , as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "[ fig : steps ]    in this example we have the permutation @xmath54 .",
    "the decreasing subsequences are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "they define three height lines . for an arbitrary permutation @xmath51",
    ", @xmath1 equals the number of decreasing subsequences , which is precisely the length , @xmath58 , of the _ longest increasing subsequence _ of @xmath51 . to see this",
    "take any increasing subsequence of @xmath51 . by construction",
    "every element of this subsequence belongs to a different height line .",
    "therefore @xmath59 .",
    "the reverse inequality is obtained by noticing that a nucleation event @xmath60 at level @xmath61 is necessarily situated in the forward light cone of at least one nucleation event @xmath62 at level @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath62 is called a predecessor of @xmath60 . since there is at least one nucleation event in level @xmath1 , successive selections of predecessors in consecutive levels result in an increasing subsequence of length @xmath1 , therefore @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , the mapping described here has been used before in @xcite , where the authors consider the hammersley process @xcite in order to study the asymptotics of @xmath58 as @xmath67 .",
    "we remark that the world lines of particles in the hammersley process are exactly the space - time step lines of the png model , after a rotation of @xmath68 together with an appropriate adjustment of the boundary conditions . to our knowledge",
    "this simple observation has not yet been reported in the literature and establishes a connection between the two models in much the same way as between the simple exclusion and the zero - range processes @xcite .    for given @xmath47",
    "the nucleation events are uniformly and independently distributed in the rectangle @xmath41 . since the @xmath5 and @xmath49integrations factorize",
    ", this induces the uniform distribution on the set of all permutations of length @xmath47 . by the poisson law",
    ", @xmath47 has the probability distribution @xmath69 thus the height of the png droplet is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation with poisson distributed length , which for a fixed length of the permutation is known as ulam s problem @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been spectacular advance on ulam s problem , for a survey see @xcite .",
    "one important element are deep combinatorial identities expressing the probability distribution of @xmath58 through quantities known from the theory of random matrices . in our particular context",
    "the identity reads @xmath70^n}\\hspace{-5 mm } \\exp\\big(2\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\cos\\theta_j\\big ) \\prod_{1\\leq j",
    "< k\\leq n}\\hspace{-3mm}|e^{i\\theta_j}-e^{i\\theta_k}|^2d^n\\theta,\\ ] ] which corresponds to the partition function for the eigenvalues in the unitary ensemble with an external cosine potential .",
    "et al _ @xcite succeeded to extract from ( [ eq : finite ] ) the @xmath71 asymptotics with the results @xmath72 and @xmath73 together with the convergence of moments . here",
    "@xmath22 is a random variable , whose distribution is the famous tracy - widom ( tw ) distribution of the properly shifted and rescaled largest eigenvalue of a gue distributed random matrix @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 has the distribution function @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the unique solution of the painlev ii equation , @xmath76 with the asymptotic boundary conditions @xmath77 as @xmath78 , @xmath79 being the airy function @xcite . the probability density , @xmath80 , of @xmath14 has the asymptotics @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "we remark that the connection of the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : finite ] ) to the painlev ii equation has been established on an heuristic level already in the context of unitary - matrix models @xcite .    to come back to the png droplet",
    "we only have to use that @xmath85 and to translate ( [ eq : limit ] ) and ( [ eq : scaling ] ) into the surface picture .",
    "equation ( [ eq : limit ] ) states that the droplet acquires for large times a deterministic ellipsoidal shape given by @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "thus with our particular initial conditions the png model grows in the form of a droplet .",
    "the second result ensures that the shape fluctuations are on the scale @xmath12 and in addition identifies the limiting distribution , @xmath88 note that in ( [ eq : distribution ] ) only the asymptotic average is subtracted .",
    "therefore @xmath22 may have a mean different from zero , which is indeed the case , as can be seen in figure 2 , where the tw distribution @xmath80 is plotted on a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "for flat initial conditions , by translational invariance , it suffices to study the distribution of the height above the origin , i.e. @xmath9 . at first glance , since the droplet curvature vanishes on the microscopic scale , one would expect the distributions for @xmath14 in equation ( [ eq : flatscalingform ] ) and for @xmath22 in equation ( [ eq : dropletscalingform ] ) to be identical . to better understand this point we again consider the png model .",
    "the flat initial conditions in the png model are @xmath89 and nucleation is now allowed everywhere on the line .",
    "we consider @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath11 depends on nucleation events in the backward light cone of @xmath90 , i.e. in the triangle @xmath91 , @xmath92 . as",
    "before we construct a random permutation from the nucleation events inside @xmath93 and @xmath11 equals the length of the longest increasing subsequence .",
    "unfortunately the induced measure on the permutations is no longer uniform and the analogue of ( [ eq : finite ] ) does not seem to be known .    to relate @xmath11 to the distribution @xmath94 of the height process from the png droplet we define @xmath95 , @xmath96 as the height which results if the height lines are constructed from nucleation events inside the rectangle @xmath97 only . since a longest increasing subsequence of nucleation events for @xmath11",
    "must be contained in at least one of these rectangles , we have @xmath98 .",
    "now for a given set of nucleation events in @xmath93 the mapping @xmath99 , @xmath100 yields a realization of nucleation events for the png droplet up to time @xmath3 . the algorithm to determine @xmath1 , @xmath96 , for the droplet involves the same permutation as for @xmath95 , only the partition has to be into _ increasing _ subsequences starting from the _",
    "right_. nevertheless @xmath1 equals the longest increasing subsequence ( from the left ) by the same reasoning as in section [ sec : droplet ] . as a result",
    "we have the alternative expression    @xmath101    where @xmath1 is the height process from the png droplet .",
    "we note that the maximum is taken among highly correlated random variables .",
    "to model their statistics we assume local stationarity and write for the height of the droplet @xmath102 in the vicinity of @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a two sided random walk with @xmath105 , zero mean and the covariance @xmath106 , as long as @xmath107 .",
    "therefore the maximum in ( [ eq : max ] ) is achieved inside a region of order @xmath108 around @xmath103 and the modifications between the distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath94 are on the scale @xmath12 .",
    "our argument suggests that @xmath109 , which is indeed supported by the numerical simulations of section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "in addition it points at a close but non - trivial connection between the distributions @xmath14 and @xmath22 which might pave the way for an analytical description of @xmath14 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , when starting with a flat substrate of slope @xmath5 , the height at the origin scales as @xmath110 @xmath10 and @xmath16 are non - universal parameters which depend on the slope @xmath5 and have to be computed separately for each model according to the definition in ( [ eq : coefficient ] ) and above .",
    "however , @xmath14 is universal under the stated initial conditions .",
    "clearly it is desirable to have a corresponding scaling form for droplet growth , the combining feature being the scale invariance of the macroscopic shape , which means that for large @xmath58 we have @xmath111 with @xmath112 denoting the deterministic profile . for a flat substrate ( [ eq : detscaling ] ) holds trivially , whereas for a droplet the shape is determined by the wulff construction ( see for example @xcite ) . in other words , the deterministic growth equation @xmath113 with",
    "the inclination dependent growth velocity @xmath49 allows only for two types of self - affine solutions , the flat surface with slope @xmath5 , @xmath114 and the droplet @xmath115 where @xmath116 solves the equation @xmath117 .",
    "the parameter @xmath118 is related to the local slope @xmath119 by @xmath120 . in view of ( [ eq : flatscaling ] )",
    "we are therefore led to the universal scaling law for the height distribution of a growing droplet @xmath121 here @xmath22 is a random variable with tw distribution .    with the rigorous result ( [ eq : distribution ] )",
    "we are in the position to check the scaling form ( [ eq : dropletscaling ] ) for the png droplet . in the steady states of the png model",
    "the left and right island edges ( steps ) have an independent poisson distribution whose strength is determined by the average slope @xcite . with this information one",
    "obtains , in our units , the slope dependent growth velocity @xmath122 , yielding @xmath123 , and the static roughness amplitude @xmath124 .",
    "the relation @xmath125 is invertible , therefore one can write @xmath126 . comparing with ( [ eq : distribution ] ) we see that ( [ eq : dropletscaling ] ) is indeed satisfied for the png droplet .",
    "in addition , with the definition ( [ eq : tw ] ) of the tw distribution , the dimensionless scale factor , denoted by @xmath20 in equation ( [ eq : coefficient ] ) , is fixed to be @xmath0 .    in a remarkable paper",
    "@xcite johansson treats the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) by a similar but somewhat more involved mapping to increasing subsequences in generalized permutations .",
    "interpreted as a one - dimensional discrete growth model it describes a crystal occupying initially three quadrants of the plane .",
    "further particles , represented as unit squares , may nucleate only if at least two nearest neighbors are already occupied .",
    "thus the crystal grows into the forth quadrant starting from the origin .",
    "it has been known for some time @xcite that on a macroscopic scale the shape becomes deterministic .",
    "johansson proves a scaling law similar to ( [ eq : distribution ] ) with the same limiting distribution , but a negative prefactor . in",
    "the tasep particles jump , subject to the exclusion constraint , to the right with rate @xmath127 .",
    "since the stationary measures are bernoulli , one has @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 . inserting in ( [ eq : dropletscaling ] )",
    ", we recover the result of johansson , the negative prefactor coming from @xmath131 .",
    "this is one of the few instances where universality has been rigorously established on the level of distributions .",
    "in figure 2 we compare the two distributions of @xmath22 and @xmath14 in a semi - logarithmic plot .",
    "the tw distribution , which is drawn as a solid line , is obtained by numerically solving ( [ eq : painleve ] ) .",
    "its mean is @xmath132 and its variance is @xmath133 . for the skewness , @xmath134 , and the kurtosis , @xmath135 , one obtains @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath138 denotes the @xmath63-th cumulant ( fully truncated moment ) .",
    "superimposed are the empirical distributions determined at various times , ranging from @xmath139 to @xmath140 units , from a monte - carlo simulation of the png droplet .",
    "finite time effects are most pronounced for the first moment . at @xmath141",
    "there is still a noticeable deviation of about @xmath142 which seems to fade away very slowly .",
    "the other quantities agree with the exact values within the statistical fluctuations .",
    "[ fig : distributions ]    since for the distribution of @xmath14 there is no analytic expression available , we performed monte carlo simulations of the continuum png model for flat and equidistantly stepped initial conditions .",
    "we used slopes @xmath143 , @xmath0 and @xmath127 , up to only moderate times @xmath144 on an effectively infinite substrate .",
    "the number of independent runs were around @xmath145 for each slope , but due to translation invariance the number of sample points is about @xmath146 for each recorded time . from our data we estimate the mean , variance , skewness , and kurtosis of @xmath14 as @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , respectively . in view of the slow convergence of the first moment for the png droplet",
    "the estimate for @xmath151 has to be taken with care , since it might not yet have reached its true asymptotic value .",
    "our values are consistent with earlier studies of @xmath14 for various growth models @xcite .",
    "so far we started the growth process with a deterministic height profile .",
    "an obvious variant is to start with a random configuration .",
    "the most natural choice is to take a stationary height statistics obtained in the long time limit . if @xmath1 denotes this stationary growth process ( i.e. the statistics of @xmath152 depends only on space - time differences ) , then as before @xmath153 for large @xmath3 . along a trajectory with slope different from @xmath154",
    "one has ordinary diffusive scaling as @xmath15 due to the static roughness of the height profile .",
    "our simulations ( not shown ) yield , the mean being zero by definition , 1.476(7 ) , 0.375(5 ) , and 0.31(1 ) for the variance , skewness , and kurtosis of @xmath155 , which again is consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have identified three distinct universal distributions : growth with noisy stationary initial data , and curved and flat growth from deterministic initial data .",
    "in addition we have pointed out that the height of the png droplet is simply related to the statistics of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation .",
    "this leads to a complete characterization of the macroscopic shape and of the fluctuations in the height above a single reference point .",
    "it is somewhat unexpected to have the links one - dimensional surface growth to random permutations to random matrices . as a first introduction to the latter we recommend the survey paper by aldous and diaconis @xcite .",
    "longest increasing subsequences arise there in the context of solitaire or patience card games . in patience sorting a well shuffled deck of @xmath47 cards , labeled @xmath156 , is dealt into piles according to the , admittedly somewhat boring , two rules : ( i ) a low card is always placed on the leftmost pile with a higher card on top .",
    "( ii ) if ( i ) can not be achieved , a new pile is started to the right of the previous piles .",
    "the connection to the png model is immediate .",
    "a pile of cards corresponds to a height line , the pile size is the number of nucleation events on the height line , and , of course , the number of piles is the height .",
    "as regards to surface growth it would be of great interest to further exploit the random matrix theory in the computation of universal properties and to extend this technique to higher dimensions .",
    "we thank craig tracy for providing us with the mathematica@xmath157 code for the tw distribution .",
    "in the meantime we have noted that the scaling distribution @xmath14 for a flat substrate is the limiting distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a goe distributed random matrix @xcite .",
    "more precicely , the distribution function of @xmath14 is given by @xmath158 its first four cumulants are @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 .",
    "our proof uses the symmetrized random permutations studied by baik and rains @xcite .",
