    "the way to proceed and the essential ingredients have been all presented above . we will not write down the general result for @xmath185 in all the examples above",
    "there is one feature in common : the eigenstates @xmath105 of @xmath186 appear under the action of @xmath163 and move along the chain under iterations .",
    "they move both forward and backward .",
    "there can be multiple @xmath187 depending on the initial state .",
    "the iterations above are to be implemented in ( [ 5.9 ] ) .",
    "using systematically the results above one can start to study the evolution of an initial chain configuration .      for clarity and relative simplicity",
    "we start with an open 6-chain of @xmath188 spin states ( [ 5.1 ] ) .",

    "it will be shown that it is sufficient to implement the series development @xmath195evaluating finally , @xmath196for @xmath197 one already obtains states of the type ( [ 5.29 ] ) ( along with others orthogonal to it as given in ( [ 5.30 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover @xmath198 is obtained explicitly in terms of @xmath199 where @xmath142 is given ( for any chosen origin ) and from ( [ 5.7 ] ) ( restricting the values of @xmath3 for definiteness , to @xmath200 ) @xmath201for @xmath100 ( i.e. for @xmath202 ) . the sign ambiguity in ( [ 5.7 ] )",
    "corresponds to the two possible determinations of @xmath89 ( as explained in ( [ 3.4 ] ) ) corresponding to two possible regimes .",
    "next , one can easily invert the relations and thus extract @xmath203 from @xmath204 .",
    "thus the initial mixed state at the left of the chain can be extracted by precise observation of the specific mixed state ( [ 5.29 ] ) at the right end of the chain at a finite time @xmath192 .    in this precise sense , we say that the initial state @xmath205 at the left has been transmitted to the right as @xmath206 where @xmath207 can be recovered from @xmath208",
    ".    from the results of appendix c one obtains @xmath209where @xmath210 , @xmath211 are given in the appendix . from ( c.19 ) , ( [ c.21 ] ) one sees ( since @xmath212 and @xmath90 are known ) that the coefficient of ( @xmath213 ) in @xmath214 gives directly @xmath215 from @xmath216 one then easily extracts @xmath217 also from the coefficients of powers of @xmath142 in @xmath198 .",
    "thus our goal is attained .    apart from the development ( [ 5.9 ] ) in powers of @xmath192 , we can also set @xmath218and assuming @xmath219 to be small , use a series development in powers of @xmath220 to extract information more readily concerning the initial state from that at time @xmath142 .",
