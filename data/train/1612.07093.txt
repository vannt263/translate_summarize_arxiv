    "recently , there has been renewed interest in the formation and properties of compact astrophysical objects comprising of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "since dark matter interacts with normal baryonic matter through gravity , it is quite possible for white dwarfs and neutron stars to accrete dark matter and evolve to a dark matter admixed compact star .",
    "moreover , the large baryonic density in compact stars increases the probability of dark matter capture within the star and eventually results in gravitational trapping .",
