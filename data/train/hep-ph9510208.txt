    "the production of heavy quark - antiquark bound states like charmonium , bottomonium , and the yet undiscovered charmed beauty mesons at high energy @xmath1 and hadronic machines can provide very interesting tests of perturbative qcd . in the charmonium case , our traditional wisdom has been taken the following scenario : most of the @xmath7 comes predominately from either the radiative decay of the p - wave @xmath8 states produced by the lowest order gluon fusion mechanism or the weak decays of b mesons , whereas the @xmath9 should be produced almost entirely from b meson decays . similarly , most of the @xmath10 should be produced from the radiative @xmath11 decay . only until recently can this naive thinking be confronted by the wealth of high energy experimental data collected at the tevatron . during the 1992 - 1993 run ,",
    "the cdf detector recorded surprisingly large production rates of the prompt @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 which are orders of magnitude above the theoretical lowest order predictions @xcite . in 1993",
    "@xcite , it was realized that fragmentation can play an important role in quarkonium production at the large transverse momentum @xmath12 region at the tevatron .",
    "parton fragmentation into quarkonium is formally a higher order process but nevertheless it can be enhanced at the sufficiently large transverse momentum region compared with the usual gluon fusion process @xcite .",
    "a simple explanation of the enhancement is that the fragmenting partons are produced at high energies but with small invariant masses which can lead to the enhancement factor of powers of @xmath13 compared with the gluon fusion mechanism .",
    "most of the fragmentation functions for quarkonium that are relevant to phenomenology have now been calculated .",
    "gluon fragmentation functions were calculated in ref.@xcite for the s - wave , ref.@xcite for the p - wave , and ref.@xcite for the @xmath14 state ; heavy quark fragmentation functions were calculated in ref.@xcite for the s - wave , and ref.@xcite for the p - wave .",
    "phenomenological applications of these fragmentation functions have been performed by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "the current scenario of charmonium production at high transverse momentum is as follows : among all fragmentation contributions that are relevant to @xmath7 production , the dominant ones come from ( i ) gluon fragmentation into a color - octet @xmath15 @xmath16 state followed by a double e1 transition into @xmath7 , and ( ii ) gluon fragmentation into @xmath8 followed by the radiative decay @xmath17 .",
    "the former mechanism is the most dominant one for @xmath9 production because of the absence of @xmath18 states below the @xmath19 threshold .",
    "the current experimental status with this new fragmentation insight has now been reviewed by many people in various occasions .",
    "we refer the readers to refs.@xcite for more details .",
    "the charmed beauty @xmath3 mesons are expected to be observed soon at the tevatron and preliminary limits on the production rate already exists @xcite .",
    "parton fragmentation has been applied phenomenologically to the production of @xmath2 mesons as well at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark fragmentation functions for @xmath20 were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the s - wave and in refs .",
    "@xcite for the p - wave .",
    "the validity of the parton fragmentation has been questioned in some recent exact @xmath21 calculations @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations obtained different results and led to conflicting conclusions among themselves .",
    "it was only until the recent appearance of the results of ref.@xcite that this controversy can be settled down and the validity of the fragmentation approximation can be established in the production of @xmath22 mesons at the tevatron .",
    "one can , therefore , use the fragmentation approximation with confidence in calculating the production cross sections and transverse momentum spectra of the @xmath22 mesons , including the leading logarithmic corrections , induced gluon fragmentation contribution @xcite , and contributions from all orbitally excited states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the previous calculations of heavy quark fragmentation functions to the d - wave case .",
    "the d - wave orbitally excited states are of interests phenomenologically . in the @xmath23 case ,",
    "one set of the d - wave states is predicted by potential models to lie below the @xmath24 threshold .",
    "these states , once produced , will cascade into the pseudo - scalar ground state @xmath6 via pion and/or photon emissions and thereby contribute to the inclusive production rate of @xmath6 .",
    "the excited d - wave charmonium resonances have also been suggested @xcite to resolve the @xmath9 surplus problem observed at cdf . in section ii , we briefly review the factorization model of bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite that can consistently factor out the long - distance physics and short - distance perturbative factors for the inclusive production and decay rates of heavy quarkonium . in section iii ,",
    "we present the calculation of the d - wave fragmentation functions for both the unequal and equal mass cases within the spirit of the factorization model .",
    "we discuss our results in section iv and conclude in section v.",
    "a rigorous theory based on non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) has been developed recently by bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite for the inclusive decay and production of heavy quarkonium . using this formalism",
    ", the fragmentation function for a heavy quark @xmath25 to split into a quarkonium state @xmath26 with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are local 4-fermion operators defined in nrqcd .",
    "the short - distance coefficients @xmath30 are independent of the quarkonium state @xmath26 . for a fragmentation scale @xmath31 of order of the heavy quark mass @xmath32 ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 can be calculated using perturbation theory in strong coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "the relative size of the matrix elements @xmath34 for a given state @xmath26 can be estimated by how they scale with @xmath32 and with the typical relative velocity @xmath35 of the heavy quarks inside the quarkonium .",
    "thus , the factorization formula eq.([factor ] ) is a double expansion in @xmath36 and @xmath35 . to determine the relative importance of the various terms in this formula",
    ", one should take into account both the scaling in @xmath35 of the matrix elements @xmath34 and the order of @xmath36 in the coefficients @xmath30 .",
    "the leading term in @xmath35 of this formula corresponds to the popular color - singlet model @xcite .",
    "however , keeping only the leading term in this double expansion can sometimes lead to incomplete or even inconsistent results due to the presence of infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "one important feature in the factorization model is that the quarkonium state @xmath26 is no longer considered as solely a @xmath37 pair but rather a superposition of fock states .",
    "for example , the spin - triplet @xmath38 quarkonium states , denoted by @xmath39 , have the following fock state expansion , @xmath40 where the notations @xmath41 and @xmath42 refer , respectively , to the color - singlet and color - octet states of the @xmath37 pair . in the above fock - state expansion",
    "there are also other @xmath43 states , e.g. , @xmath44 , but their production will be further suppressed by powers of @xmath35 .",
    "heavy quark fragmentation into d - wave quarkonium @xmath45 can be deduced from the leading feynman diagrams of @xmath46 as shown in fig.1 and fig.2 . in fig.1",
    ", the @xmath37 pair can be either in the color - singlet @xmath38 state , in the color - octet @xmath47 , or in the color - octet or color - singlet @xmath15 states , whereas in fig.2 it can only be in the color - octet @xmath15 state .",
    "the short - distance factors deduced from these diagrams are all of order @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , all these diagrams are also of the same order in @xmath35 . according to the nrqcd @xcite",
    ", the relevant local 4-fermion operators describing these three fock states are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 which have relative scalings like @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath37 pair in the color - octet p - wave and s - wave states can evolve nonperturbatively into the physical d - wave quarkonium state @xmath45 by emitting one and two soft gluon(s ) , respectively . emitting a soft gluon costs a factor of @xmath35 at the amplitude level in nrqcd and hence a factor of @xmath53 in the probability .",
    "thus , with a non - relativistic normalization convention in the state , all three matrix elements @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 scale like @xmath58 . as a result , both fig.1 and fig.2 contribute to the fragmentation functions of order @xmath59 and should all be taken in account for a consistent calculation . with appropriate normalization",
    ", the color - singlet matrix elements @xmath55 as well as @xmath60 for the spin - singlet d - wave state @xmath61 can be related to the non - relativistic radial d - wave wave - function @xmath62 , which is the spin average of the spin - singlet and spin - triplet @xmath63 s , by @xmath64 @xmath65 potential models can be used to determine the value of the wave - function so that the nrqcd matrix elements for the color - singlet contributions are fixed .",
    "unfortunately , potential models can not determine the color - octet matrix elements since dynamical gluons are involved .",
    "however , from our experience of the p - wave quarkonium case @xcite , we do not expect the color - octet component to play a major role in the heavy quark fragmentation .",
    "we note that this is in sharp contrast with the gluon fragmentation in which a gluon can fragment into the color - octet @xmath15 state via the process @xmath66 .",
    "this process is of order @xmath36 and is at least one power of @xmath36 lesser than the leading color - singlet term in the gluon fragmentation .",
    "we also note that the color - singlet contribution of heavy quark fragmentation from fig.1 is free of infrared divergences . on the other hand",
    ", infrared divergences will show up in the gluon fragmentation function into the spin - triplet d - wave quarkonium .",
    "it is necessary to include the color - octet contributions in order to achieve a finite and sensible perturbative answers for the gluon fragmentation functions into spin - triplet d - wave states . in what follows",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the color - singlet contribution in the heavy quark fragmentation into d - wave quarkonium .",
    "if the color - octet matrix elements can be determined in the future , it is straightforward to include their contributions since their corresponding short - distance coefficients can be extracted easily from the previous s - wave and p - wave calculations by modifying the color factors .    the factorization model for the quarkonium system can be extended to the unequal mass case like the @xmath23 meson system . in what follows",
    ", we will denote the spin - singlet and the spin - triplet d - wave @xmath23 meson states by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . in this case ,",
    "figure  2 is absent for the color - octet contribution .",
    "the general covariant formalism for calculating the production and decay rates of s - wave and p - wave heavy quarkonium in the non - relativistic expansion was developed some times ago @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to extend it to the case of unequal mass and higher orbital excitation .",
    "we shall present a covariant formalism for the production of d - wave meson @xmath69 by some unspecified short - distance processes .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath70 be the masses of the two quarks with @xmath71 , and introduce the mass parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the leading non - relativistic approximation ,",
    "the mass @xmath74 of the meson is simply @xmath75 .",
    "the amplitude for producing the bound - state @xmath69 in a state with momentum @xmath76 , total angular momentum @xmath77 , total orbital angular momentum @xmath78 , and total spin @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82 represents the short - distance interaction producing the @xmath25 and @xmath83 in a specific relative orbital angular momentum , and in general is a product of dirac matrices .",
    "the heavy quarks @xmath25 and @xmath83 have momentum @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , where @xmath86 is the small relative momentum of the quarks inside the bound state .",
    "@xmath87 is the bethe - salpeter wave - function in the momentum space and is assumed to be a slow - varying smooth function of @xmath88 .",
    "sometimes @xmath89 is a trace by which the on - shell spinors @xmath90 and @xmath91 are brought together in the right order .",
    "@xmath92 , up to second order in @xmath93 , is given by @xmath94 where in the middle parenthesis @xmath95 is for @xmath96 ( spin - singlet ) and @xmath97 is for @xmath98 ( spin - triplet ) .",
    "since @xmath99 is a small quantity , we can expand @xmath89 around @xmath100 in a taylor expansion : @xmath101 where the first , second , and third terms correspond to quantum numbers @xmath102 and @xmath103 of the orbital angular momentum , and so forth .",
    "thus for the s - wave ( @xmath104 ) , p - wave ( @xmath105 ) , and d - wave ( @xmath106 ) states , the amplitude @xmath107 will depend on the radial wave - functions @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 through the following relations : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the polarization vector for the spin-1 particle , and @xmath113 is the totally symmetric , traceless , and transverse second rank polarization tensor for the spin-2 particle . in the d - wave case ,",
    "the amplitude becomes @xmath114 for the spin - singlet case , where @xmath115 , and @xmath116 where @xmath117 for the spin - triplet case .",
    "using the appropriate clebsch - gordan coefficients , we have @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the totally symmetric , traceless , and transverse spin-3 polarization tensor",
    ". the polarization sums for @xmath121 and @xmath122 are given by the following familiar expressions @xcite @xmath123 after writing down the formalism for the general production of d - wave mesons , we shall specify the production mechanism . the specific production of d - wave @xmath69 mesons that we are considering is by the fragmentation of a heavy quark @xmath25 : @xmath124 where the off - shell @xmath125 is produced by a high energy source @xmath126 . the fragmentation function",
    "is then given by the formula @xcite : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the tree - level amplitude squared to create an on - shell @xmath25 quark with the same 3-momentum @xmath129 , and @xmath130 is the amplitude squared for producing @xmath131 from the same source @xmath126 .",
    "the general procedures to extract the fragmentation function have been described in detail in ref.@xcite and we shall be brief in what follows .",
    "we shall first derive the fragmentation functions for a heavy quark @xmath25 into an unequal mass d - wave @xmath69 meson .",

    "( [ mix ] ) can be determined by the clebsch - gordan coefficients in the tensor product of a spin @xmath218 state and a spin @xmath103 state with the following result : @xmath224 _ i.e. _ , we are transforming the states @xmath14 and @xmath161 in the ls coupling scheme to the states @xmath225 and @xmath163 in the @xmath226 coupling scheme .    in their discussions of the heavy quark fragmentation functions within the context of heavy quark",
    "effective theory , jaffe and randall @xcite showed that fragmentation functions can have a @xmath227 expansion if expanded in terms of a more natural variable @xmath228 rather than the usual fragmentation variable @xmath27 , and the heavy - quark mass expansion is given as a power series in @xmath195 , @xmath229 where @xmath230 , _ etc . _",
    "are functions of the variable @xmath231 .",
    "the leading term @xmath232 is constrained by the heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry while all the higher order terms contain spin - flavor symmetry breaking effects .",
    "one can recast our results for the d - wave fragmentation functions derived in sec.iii in the above form , by carefully expanding the powers of @xmath195 and @xmath233 .",
    "the leading @xmath234 terms of the fragmentation functions are then given by @xmath235 where @xmath236 .",
    "thus , at leading - order of @xmath227 , we obtain the following spin - counting ratios @xmath237 as expected from heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "the detections of the d - wave orbitally excited states of heavy - heavy mesons are much more difficult than their ground states .",
    "so far , none of d - wave quarkonium has been identified .",
    "the basic reasons are ( i ) the production rates are small , ( ii ) small branching ratios in subsequent decays , and ( iii ) the very small efficiencies in subsequent levels of identification . from the potential model calculations ,",
    "d - wave charmonium are likely to be above the @xmath238 threshold and hence they will decay predominantly into a pair of d mesons . in principle , d - wave quarkonium can be identified partially by their pure leptonic decay ( e.g. @xmath239 ) , or by their subsequent decays into the lower - lying states .",
    "it is because of the subsequent levels of decays that reduce substantially the branching ratios and efficiencies in identifying these d - wave bound states .",
    "however , both the branching ratios and efficiencies are uncertain at this stage . in the following",
    ", we shall estimate the production rates of the d - wave charmonium , bottomonium , and @xmath22 mesons based upon the fragmentation functions obtained in sec .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "the values of @xmath240 for the @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath22 systems were summarized nicely in ref.@xcite using different potential models .",
    "we choose the qcd - motivated potential of buchmller and tye @xcite , and the corresponding values of @xmath240 for the @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath22 systems are 0.015 , 0.637 , and 0.055 gev@xmath243 , respectively .",
    "these values are for the first set of the d - wave states .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath240 obtained using the buchmller - tye potential are the smallest ones of the four potential models studied in ref.@xcite .    in the following analysis",
    ", we will adopt the values @xmath244 gev and @xmath245 gev that were used in the fit of the buchmller - tye potential to the bound state spectra @xcite .",
    "we first evaluate the fragmentation probabilities for a @xmath4 antiquark into d - wave @xmath22 mesons by substituting @xmath246 into eqs .",
    "( [ prob1 ] )  ( [ prob2 ] ) . using @xmath247 , @xmath248 for the @xmath22 system , and ignoring the possibly small mixing effects",
    ", we obtain @xmath249 therefore , the total probability is about @xmath250 .",
    "we can compare this value with the corresponding probabilities of the s - wave and p - wave states .",
    "using the same @xmath36 and the values of @xmath251 and @xmath252 calculated with the same buchmller - tye potential , the total fragmentation probabilities of the 1s and 1p @xmath23 states are about @xmath253 and @xmath254 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these total fragmentation probabilities show a similar suppression factor of order @xmath53 in going from 1s to 1p states and from 1p to 1d states , which are in accord with the velocity counting rules in nrqcd @xcite .",
    "next , for the d - wave charmonium we use @xmath255 and @xmath256 , and obtain @xmath257 the total probability is about @xmath258 , to be compared with the probabilities of @xmath259 @xcite and @xmath260 @xcite obtained using the same inputs . with our inputs , the gluon fragmentation probability into the @xmath14 charmonium @xcite is about @xmath261 .",
    "similarly , using @xmath262 and @xmath263 for the bottomonium , we obtain @xmath264 the total probability for the d - wave bottomonium is very small @xmath265 .",
    "this is to be compared with the probabilities of @xmath266 @xcite and @xmath267 .",
    "we observe that the relative probabilities for the s - wave to p - wave quarkonium and for the p - wave to d - wave quarkonium are roughly suppressed by a similar factor of @xmath53 as in the @xmath3 case .    at the tevatron",
    "the @xmath268-quark production cross section is of order @xmath269 with @xmath270 gev , which implies about @xmath271 @xmath268-quarks with an accumulated luminosity of 100 @xmath272 . using the fragmentation probabilities calculated above",
    ", we expect about @xmath273 d - wave @xmath22 mesons , while there are only about 50 d - wave bottomonium . at large @xmath274 , charm quark production is very similar to bottom quark production . therefore , the @xmath275-quark production cross section is also of order 10 @xmath276 and there should be about @xmath273 d - wave charmonium for the same luminosity .",
    "although the production rates of d - wave @xmath22 mesons and charmonium are rather substantial , the small branching ratios and efficiencies of identification in subsequent levels of decays render their detections extremely difficult .",
    "for example , the combined branching ratio br@xmath277 has been estimated to be about @xmath278 @xcite .",
    "even after the installation of the main injector when the yearly luminosity can be boosted to 1  3 @xmath279 , the chance of detecting the d - wave @xmath22 mesons or charmonium is still quite slim .",
    "the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) can produce @xmath280 @xmath281 pairs and @xmath282 pairs per year running .",
    "it can then produce about @xmath283 d - wave @xmath23 mesons and charmonium . after taking into account the branching ratios and efficiencies",
    ", there should be a handful number of these d - wave states that can be identified .",
    "nevertheless , detection of the d - wave bottomonium does not seem to be feasible even at the lhc !",
    "the production of @xmath281 and @xmath282 pairs at lep , lepii , and other higher energy @xmath1 or @xmath284 colliders are much smaller than at the hadronic colliders .",
    "therefore , it is much more difficult to identify the d - wave quarkonium or @xmath22 mesons at the @xmath1 or @xmath284 facilities .    in conclusions ,",
    "we have computed the heavy quark fragmentation functions into d - wave heavy - heavy mesons containing two heavy quarks to leading order in strong coupling constant and to leading order in the non - relativistic expansion within the framework of factorization model of bodwin , braaten , and lepage .",
    "the color - singlet contributions can be expressed in terms of the nrqcd matrix elements which are related to the second derivative of the non - relativistic radial d - wave wave - function .",
    "the color - octet contributions are expected to be quite small in the heavy quark fragmentation and therefore we have ignored them in the present analysis .",
    "the fragmentation functions obtained in this work should be useful in the production of the d - wave charmonium , bottomonium , and @xmath22 mesons at the future large hadronic collider .",
