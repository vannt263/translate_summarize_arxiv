    "these have been manipulated by means of laser traps in various manners , e.g. vortices have been created or collisions of two becs have been studied @xcite . an interesting link to solid - state phenomena has been established by creating optical lattices , in which a mott transition has been theoretically predicted @xcite and observed @xcite .",
    "recently , proposals to trap cold atomic gases using microfabricated structures @xcite have been realized experimentally @xcite on silicon substrates , so - called atom chips .",

    "micro - fabricated traps made it possible to split clouds of cold atomic gases in a beam splitter geometry @xcite , to transport wavepackets along a conveyer belt structure @xcite and to accumulate atomic clouds in a storage ring @xcite .",
    "moreover , a bec has been successfully transferred into a micro - trap and transported along a waveguide created by a current carrying micro - structure fabricated onto a chip @xcite .",
    "finally several suggestions to integrate an atom interferometer for cold gases onto an atom chip have been put forward @xcite .",
    "the high magnetic - field gradients in atom - chip traps provide a strongly confined motion of the atomic quantum gases along the micro - structured wires .",
    "the atomic cloud will be situated in close vicinity of the chip surface . as a consequence , there will be interactions between the substrate and the trapped atomic cloud , and the cold gas can no longer be considered to be an isolated system .",
    "recent experiments reported a fragmentation of cold atomic clouds or becs in a wire waveguide @xcite on reducing the distance between the wavepackets and the chip surface , showing that atomic gases in wire traps are very sensitive to its environment .",
