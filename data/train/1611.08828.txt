    "soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) has been first proposed as an effective field theory describing inclusive @xmath0 meson decays with an energetic light quark in the final state and exclusive @xmath0 decays with an energetic light hadron in the final state  @xcite .",
    "physics at short distances ( @xmath1 ) is encapsulated in matching coefficients ; soft dynamics of the @xmath2 quark is described by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) ; soft and collinear degrees of freedom of light quarks and gluons are described by scet .",
    "speaking more precisely , there are two closely related effective theories , scet - i and scet - ii .",
    "later scet was successfully applied to numerous problems in hadron collider physics . in this area",
    "there are at least two large nearly light - like momenta , and hence several collinear regions ( jets , initial hadrons ) .",
    "additional effective field theories were proposed for various classes of such problems .",
    "these lectures are an elementary introduction to scet",
    ". a very nice textbook on scet has recently appeared  @xcite , i follow the first chapters of this book .",
    "there are also lecture notes  @xcite .",
    "i do nt cite original papers here , citations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "scet can be formulated in two different languages : the coordinate space lagrangian  @xcite or the label formalism  @xcite .",
    "the book  @xcite mostly follows the first approach , while the lectures  @xcite  the second one .",
    "i shall not describe the label formalism here .",
    "let s first discuss what are effective field theories .",
    "many problems in quantum field theory contain several widely separated energy scales .",
    "suppose there is a high momentum scale @xmath3 ( and a short distance scale @xmath4 ) , and we are interested in interactions of light particles ( @xmath5 ) having small momenta ( @xmath6 ) , or in other words , physics at large distances @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of the characteristic soft scale to @xmath3 is the small expansion parameter @xmath8 .",
    "one of approaches to such problems is the method of regions for loop diagrams  @xcite . a brief introduction to this method",
    "is given in sect .",
    "[ s : reg ] , see  @xcite for more details .    another approach is low energy ( or large distance ) effective field theories .",
    "one can construct an effective lagrangian containing only light fields .",
    "physics at small distances @xmath9 produces local interactions of these fields .",
    "the lagrangian contains all possible operators ( allowed by symmetries of the full theory ) . in order to find coefficients of these operators matching",
    "is performed .",
    "we calculate some scattering amplitudes in the full theory and expands them in @xmath8 up to some order ; then we calculate the same amplitudes in the effective theory , equate the results and find the coefficients in the effective lagrangian . in other words , hard degrees of freedom",
    "are integrated out from the path integral producing the soft effective action .",
    "similarly , operators of the full theory can be represented as @xmath4 expansions in terms of operators of the effective theory with appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "coefficients in such expansions are also obtained by matching : calculate some on - shell matrix elements in the full theory , expand in @xmath8 , calculate them in the effective theory , equate the results and find matching coefficients .",
    "there is a close correspondence between effective theories and the method of regions .",
    "hard regions produce matching coefficients , while soft ones are feynman diagrams of the effective theory . if one wants to consider just a single process described by a small number of diagrams , it is rather easy to find many terms of its @xmath8 expansion by the method of regions .",
    "the effective field theory framework quickly becomes very complicated with the growth of order of this expansion ; usually , only a few first terms can be considered . on the other hand ,",
    "an effective field theory is applicable to all processes at once .",
    "it often allows one to derive various properties which are valid to all orders of perturbation theory , such as factorization theorems and renormalization group ( rg ) equations .",
    "the leading terms of an effective lagrangian can have some symmetry which is not obvious in the full theory .",
    "scet is more complicated than simple effective theories because it is anisotropic .",
    "characteristic momentum scales ( and distance scales ) are different in different directions .",
    "we discuss scet for the scalar @xmath10 field theory in sect .",
    "[ s : scal ] .",
    "this simple example shows most typical features of scet ; however , the coupling constant @xmath11 is dimensionful , and the situation with resummation of all orders of perturbation theory radically differs fro that in qcd ( @xmath10 in @xmath12 dimensional space ",
