    "however , whereas these regions are 1handlebodies in the case @xmath406 this is not necessarily true for higher dimensions .    in our construction , the vertices of each @xmath1simplex are partitioned into sets with at most two vertices in order to achieve spines of small dimension .",
    "other partitions allow the definition of more general types of multisections , which are decompositions of the @xmath1manifold into regions with spines of _ smallish _ dimension ( but possibly greater than one ) , and so they are more complicated than 1handlebodies .",
    "we first explain in  [ sec : constructing with symmetric representations ] how the symmetric representations of @xcite can be used to construct multisections and give a number of applications of this approach : multisections of spheres and real projective spaces , and the three general constructions of _ products _ , _ generalised multisections _ and _ twisted multisections_. we also discuss _ connected sums _ in  [ subsec : conn sums ] , a _ dirichlet construction _ in  [ sec : dirichlet ] , and the case of _ manifolds with non - empty boundary _ in  [ sec : multisections for non - closed ] .",
    "given a triangulated @xmath1manifold @xmath57 with the property that the degree of each @xmath328simplex is even , the authors defined a _",
    "symmetric representation _",
    "@xmath407 in @xcite as follows .",
    "pick one @xmath1simplex as a base , choose a bijection between its corners and @xmath408 and then _ reflect _ this labelling across its codimension - one faces to the adjacent @xmath1simplices .",
    "this induced labelling is propagated further and if one returns to the base simplex , one obtains a permutation of the vertex labels .",
    "since the dual 1skeleton carries the fundamental group , it can be shown that this gives a homomorphism @xmath409 see @xcite for the details .",
    "for example , the symmetric representation associated to any barycentric subdivision is trivial , since the labels correspond to the dimension of the simplex containing that vertex in its interior , but there may be more efficient even triangulations with this property .    the symmetric representation can also be used to propagate partitions of the vertices of the base simplex ; this is done in @xcite for partitions into two sets , but extends to arbitrary partitions .",
    "one then obtains a _ induced representation _ , usually into a symmetric group of larger degree .",
    "the aim in @xcite was to obtain information on the topology of a manifold from a non - trivial symmetric representation arising from a triangulation with few vertices .",
    "our needs in this paper are opposite , and we wish to use the symmetric representations to identify triangulations to which we can apply our constructions without barycentric subdivision .",
    "so we either want the _ orbits _ of the vertices under the symmetric representation to give a partition satisfying the conditions in our constructions ; or we ask for partitions of the vertices with the property that the induced representation is trivial .    the main properties to check for a given partition of the vertices are that the graphs spanned by the partition sets are connected , and , in even dimensions , that the dimension of the spine drops when intersecting all but one of the handlebodies .      * spheres . *",
    "the @xmath1-sphere can be obtained by doubling an @xmath1-simplex .",
    "this is an even triangulation with trivial symmetric representation . in odd dimensions ,",
    "this induces a multisection that is a division of a @xmath66dimensional sphere into @xmath2 balls , each corresponding to a pair of vertices of the @xmath1-simplex . in even dimensions",
    "this is a division of a @xmath410dimensional sphere into @xmath2 balls , one corresponding to a single vertex and each of the remaining ones corresponding to a pair of vertices ; here one obtains a multisection directly from the partition function without stellar subdivision .",
    "moreover , symmetries of the triangulation permuting the partition sets of the vertices interchange all handlebodies in odd dimensions ; in even dimensions they fix the handlebody corresponding to the singleton and act transitively on the remaining ones .      * projective spaces . * a symmetric triangulation of the @xmath1sphere",
    "is obtained by the crosspolytope ( see @xcite ) , which is the set of vectors @xmath411 in @xmath412 satisfying @xmath413 .",
    "so there are @xmath414 @xmath1simplices .",
    "this is invariant under the antipodal map and so descends to an even triangulation of @xmath415 .",
    "we can label the vertices of the triangulation of @xmath416 by the position @xmath115 of the unique coordinate @xmath417 with @xmath418 .",
    "pairs of vertices with @xmath419 are interchanged by the antipodal map so this descends to a labelling of the @xmath1 vertices of the triangulation of @xmath415 .",
    "assume first that @xmath3 .",
    "then we can pair the vertices @xmath420 for @xmath16 . for @xmath421",
    ", the multisection is the heegaard splitting of genus one , giving two solid tori . for @xmath422 ,",
    "the multisection has @xmath2 handlebodies of genus @xmath21 , whence equivalent with @xmath423 in fact there are symmetries of the triangulation interchanging all the handlebodies , so they must all have the same genus .",
    "suppose next that @xmath4 .",
    "we can then pair up vertices @xmath424 for @xmath425 leaving @xmath19 as a singleton partition set .",
    "it is necessary to perform stellar subdivisions of facets with vertices labelled @xmath115 with @xmath426 . for the vertices",
    "labelled @xmath424 for @xmath425 , there is still a symmetry interchanging all the handlebodies corresponding to the partition sets .",
    "these handlebodies are equivalent with @xmath427 and hence have genus @xmath369 in contrast , the handlebody corresponding to the partition set labelled @xmath19 is of genus @xmath428",
    ".    * generalised multisections . *",
    "suppose that @xmath14 is a triangulated @xmath1manifold with an even triangulation with trivial symmetric representation .",
    "as above , given any triangulation , the first barycentric subdivision has this property .",
    "we can define further multisections as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath429 .",
    "assume that we have partition sets @xmath430 where the sets have three vertices in every @xmath1-simplex .",
    "we then map each @xmath1simplex to the @xmath53simplex by mapping each partition set to a vertex of this @xmath53simplex .",
    "it is then easy to verify that we obtain a division of @xmath14 into @xmath2 regions , and each region has a @xmath105dimensional spine , given by the union of all the @xmath105simplices in each @xmath1simplex with all vertices in the same partition set . in this case , the manifold @xmath65 which is the intersection of all the handlebodies , is closed of dimension @xmath431 .",
    "again we can arrange that the induced cubing of @xmath65 is negatively curved and each intersection of a proper subcollection has a spine of low dimension .",
    "another interesting example is to have two partition sets of size @xmath432 of the vertices of each @xmath1simplex , so that @xmath433 .",
    "we assume that both @xmath434 .",
    "the induced decomposition is a bisection into two regions with spines of dimension @xmath432 . given a handle decomposition of @xmath14 ,",
    "this is similar to a hypersurface which is the boundary of the region containing all the @xmath115handles for @xmath435 .",
    "finally a very specific example is a @xmath436manifold @xmath14 with three partition sets of respective sizes @xmath437 .",
    "this induces a trisection of @xmath14 into three regions , where two are handlebodies and the third has a spine of dimension @xmath105 .",
    "* twisted multisections . *",
    "suppose a closed pl @xmath1manifold has an even triangulation with a non - trivial symmetric representation .",
    "assume also that the symmetry preserves our standard partition of the vertices , i.e.every symmetry mapping produces a permutation of the partition sets of vertices .",
    "then there is an associated ` twisted ' multisection , which we illustrate with a simple example  the general construction then becomes clear .",
    "assume @xmath14 is a 5manifold that admits an even triangulation with a symmetric representation with image @xmath438 .",
    "also assume this symmetry is a permutation of the form @xmath439 of the labelling of the vertices .",
    "in this case , we choose as partition sets @xmath440 then these are permuted under the action of the symmetric mapping .",
    "the edges joining these three pairs of vertex sets clearly form a connected graph @xmath441 .    a regular neighbourhood of @xmath441 then forms a single handlebody @xmath442 whose boundary is glued to itself to form @xmath14 .",
    "the handlebody @xmath442 lifts to three handlebodies in a regular 3fold covering space @xmath443 of @xmath14 and these give a standard trisection of @xmath443 .",
    "the covering transformation group @xmath438 permutes the handlebodies and preserves the central submanifold . if the initial triangulation is flag , then the lifted triangulation is flag and hence the central submanifold has a non - positively curved cubing on which the covering transformation group acts isometrically .",
    "hence the quotient , which embeds in @xmath444 also has a non - positively curved cubing .",
    "suppose the @xmath1manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath445 have multisections .",
    "then we can define the connected sum of these by removing small open @xmath1disks @xmath446 @xmath447 from @xmath90 @xmath445 respectively , so that the closures meet the multisections in the standard multisection of the ball .",
    "we can then glue the multisections of @xmath448 and @xmath449 with a gluing map that matches the multisections along the boundary spheres to form the connected sum multisection , and the resulting connected sum depends on the way the handlebodies of @xmath14 and @xmath445 are matched up .",
    "the general construction uses the polyhedral metric defined by each simplex having the standard euclidean metric .",
    "such metrics arise in regge calculus ( see @xcite ) , which applies pl topology to general relativity and quantum gravity .",
    "suppose @xmath14 is given with a triangulation and partition function supporting a multisection .",
    "assume that @xmath130 is the graph of all edges corresponding to the @xmath115^th^ partition set of the vertices .",
    "then the handlebodies of a multisection are given by @xmath450 in other words , the multisection is defined by a dirichlet construction , where instead of considering distance from a set of distinct points , we use distance from a collection of disjoint graphs . in particular , each handlebody is the set of all points , which are not further from one of the partition edge graphs than any of the others .",
    "moreover the _ multisection submanifolds _ , i.e.the submanifolds arising from intersections , are then given by @xmath451 in particular , in some symmetric spaces we can use this dirichlet viewpoint to achieve that all multisection submanifolds are totally geodesic relative to the appropriate symmetric space metric .",
    "for these submanifolds are intersections of piecewise totally geodesic hypersurfaces , given by sets of points equidistant from two distinct points .",
    "this works in the case that the handlebodies are actually cells , so our dirichlet construction is the usual one .    as an example , first consider @xmath416 with the standard round metric .",
    "first assume @xmath3 .",
    "we can pick equally spaced points @xmath452 from a totally geodesic embedded @xmath453 .",
    "these points form an orbit of the isometric action of the symmetric group @xmath454 on @xmath416 , where the action preserves the standard hopf link @xmath455 and the points lie in one of these copies of @xmath453 .",
    "then the standard dirichlet construction gives the standard multisection for @xmath416 .",
    "if @xmath4 , the same construction works by instead considering a totally geodesic @xmath456 in @xmath416 and choosing @xmath53 points symmetrically situated in @xmath456 to perform the dirichlet construction .",
    "note in both even and odd cases , all the components of the multisections are totally geodesic submanifolds .",
    "a similar construction applies to @xmath457 , so the multisection submanifolds are also piecewise totally geodesic in the standard symmetric space metric . in this case , the action of the symmetric group @xmath458 is given by permuting coordinates , so we can take our orbit of points as @xmath459 , [ 0,1,0 , \\dots , 0 ] , \\dots , [ 0,\\dots,0 , 1].\\ ] ]    here is a simple example of a multisection dirichlet construction using graphs rather than points .",
    "start with the round metric on @xmath460 considered as the unit sphere in @xmath461 .",
    "choose three geodesic circles given by @xmath462 @xmath463 @xmath464 for @xmath465 .",
    "the dirichlet regions relative to these circles are given by @xmath466 for @xmath467 .",
    "the central submanifold is the flat 3-torus defined by @xmath468 .",
    "each handlebody is @xmath469 , and each intersection of pairs of handlebodies is a copy of @xmath470 .",
    "this multisection is in fact the pull back of the multisection of @xmath471 , viewing @xmath460 as a circle bundle over @xmath471 .",
    "the same construction works for all odd dimensional spheres  they have multisections where all the handlebodies are a product of a circle and a ball .",
    "a natural product of multisections can be defined via the categorical product or the external join . however , both of these operations generally do not result in manifolds , and it is an interesting topic for investigation to relate them to a multisection of the direct product in a canonical way .",
    "the _ categorical product _ of @xmath10 and @xmath14 is a simplicial complex of dimension @xmath474 which is homotopy equivalent to the direct product @xmath475 ( * ? ? ?",
    "the set of vertices of a simplex in the categorical product is the direct product of the vertices of a simplex in @xmath10 with the set of vertices of a simplex in @xmath54 hence a partition of the vertices can be canonically defined from the partitions for @xmath10 and @xmath476 @xmath477 and @xmath478 are in the same partition set if and only if either @xmath479 and @xmath480 is a partition set of @xmath14 or @xmath481 is a partition set of @xmath10 and @xmath482    the _ join _ of @xmath10 and @xmath90 denoted @xmath483 is a simplicial complex of dimension @xmath484 which is equivalent to @xmath485 $ ] with @xmath486 collapsed to @xmath10 and @xmath487 collapsed to @xmath54 in this case , @xmath488 is equivalent with @xmath489 and has a natural cell decomposition . in the case @xmath10 and @xmath14 are standard spheres , @xmath490 is again a standard sphere ( * ? ? ?",

    "one gives a decomposition of a @xmath8manifold into two compression bodies , which are obtained by attaching @xmath21handles to products of closed surfaces and intervals along one of the boundary surfaces in each such product .",
    "the other decomposes the manifold into two handlebodies , which are glued along subsurfaces of their boundaries .",

    "hence this is a trisection of @xmath496 with one component a collar of the boundary @xmath497 and the other two components @xmath0balls .",
