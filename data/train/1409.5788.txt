    "membrane proteins are fundamental for life , and their structures and dynamics are essential for their biological functions . about 30 % of proteins encoded in genomes are estimated to be of membrane proteins by bioinformatics.@xcite although membrane - protein folding has been studied extensively by experiments,@xcite only about 2 % in whole known structures in pdb are membrane proteins , because biomembrane environment makes crystallization very difficult.@xcite thus , simulation studies are getting more important ( for previous simulations , see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "however , simulations often suffer from sampling insufficiency and the efficient sampling methods like generalized - ensemble algorithms and/or the reduction of the size of systems are required . in particular , replica - exchange method ( rem ) @xcite and its extensions are often used in generalized ensemble algorithms due to their efficiency , parallelization ease , and usability ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "one of useful approaches to reduce system sizes is to employ an implicit membrane model , which mimics some elements of membrane properties such as dielectric profile , chain order , pressure profile , and intrinsic curvature by parameters for electrostatic solvent free energy.@xcite while these methods are mainly based on the free energy difference between solvent and solute , simpler implicit membrane model was introduced previously , where transmembrane helices keep a helix structure and are always restricted within membrane regions during folding , which greatly reduces the effort for the search in the conformational space during folding processes.@xcite this model assumed that the native structure of membrane proteins can be predicted by helix - helix interactions between transmembrane helices with fixed helix structures , and that the membrane environment constraints the regions where helices can exist ( namely , within membranes ) and stabilizes transmembrane helix structures .",
    "this model is supported by many experimental data such as those leading to the two - stage model , in which each helix structure is formed first , and they aggregate each other by helix - helix packing in membrane protein folding to reach the native conformation ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the previous method @xcite could predict the native structures by the rem simulation using known native helix structures ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however ,",
    "if the native structures consist of distorted helix structures , the previous prediction method will not work because the method treated helix structures as rigid bodies .",
    "it is actually known from experimental structures in pdb that transmembrane helices are distorted or bent in about 25 % of all transmembrane helix structures .",
    "@xcite    therefore ,",
    "in this article , we propose a new treatment of helix structures by taking into account helix distortions and kinks instead of treating them as rigid bodies .",
    "we tested our new prediction method for native structures .",
    "our test systems consist of the case with only ideal helix structures and that with a distorted helix structure .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 , we explain the details of our methods .",
    "the potential energy function used for our new models and the method to introduce the helix kinks are described . in section 3 , we show the results of the rem simulation applied to glycophorin a and phospholamban .",
    "after we check that rem simulation are properly performed , the free energy minimum states are identified by the principal component analysis .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we first review our previous method@xcite .",
    "only the transmembrane helices are used in our simulations , and loop regions of membrane proteins as well as lipid and water molecules are neglected .",
    "our assumptions are that a role of water is to push the hydrophobic transmembrane regions of membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer and that a major role of lipid molecules is to prepare a hydrophobic environment and construct helix structures in the transmembrane regions .",
    "loop regions of membrane proteins are often outside the membrane and we assume that they do not directly affect the structure of transmembrane regions . due to the difference in surface shapes of helices and lipids , the stabilization energy for",
    "helix - helix packing will be larger than that for helix - lipid packing .",
    "therefore , water , lipids , and loop - region of proteins are not treated explicitly in our simulations , although the features of membrane boundaries are taken into account by the constraint conditions below .",
    "we update configurations with a rigid translation and rotation of each @xmath0-helix and torsion rotation of side - chains by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we use mc method although we can also use molecular dynamics in principle .",
    "there are 2@xmath1 + @xmath2 kinds of mc move sets , where @xmath1 is the total number of transmembrane helices in the protein , and @xmath2 is the total number of dihedral angles in the side - chain of @xmath1 helices .",
    "we add the following three elementary harmonic constraints to the original potential energy function .",
    "the constraint function is given by    @xmath3    where each term on the right - hand side is defined as follows : @xmath4 ^ 2 , \\label{const - ene1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath5 ^ 2\\right .",

    "the radius of the sphere @xmath27 is set to a large value in order to guarantee that a wide conformational space is sampled .",
    "these constraints are considered to be a simple implicit membrane model which mimics membrane environment during membrane protein folding .",
    "moreover , all constraints limit the conformational space of proteins to improve sampling and are useful when we use limited computational resources . in summary , this procedure is consistent with the two - stage model , and it assumes that side - chain flexibility is essential in their folding . because backbone structures of main chain are treated as rigid bodies in the previous method , the method can not be applied if transmembrane helices are distorted .    however , most of transmembrane helix structures in pdb have distorted or bent helix structures .",
    "we , therefore , need to treat the deformations of backbone helix structures during simulations .",
    "namely , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 torsion rotations and concerted rotation of backbone are used to reproduce the distorted helix structures of experimental structures from the initial ideal helix structures in monte carlo move sets . here , we also update configurations with a rotation of torsion angles of backbones by directional manipulation and concerted rotation.@xcite there are 2@xmath1 + @xmath2 + @xmath32 + @xmath33 kinds of mc moves now , where @xmath32 is the total number of @xmath34 torsion angles in the helix backbones , and @xmath33 is the total number of the combination of seven successive backbone torsion angle by the concerted rotation in the helix backbone .",
    "one mc step in this article is defined to be an update of one of these degrees of freedom , which is accepted or rejected according to the metropolis criterion .    in order to keep helix conformations of the distortions ,",
    "we introduce the fourth constraint term as follows : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the newly - introduced energy term which constrains dihedral angles of main chains within bending or kinked helix structures from ideal helix structures and prevent them from bending and distortions too much . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the main - chain torsion angles of the @xmath40-th residue . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the fixed reference values of the harmonic constraint , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the force constants , and @xmath45 are the central values of the harmonic constraint .",

    "therefore , this manipulation results in the smallest value close to zero for the six eigenvalues corresponding to translations and rotations of the center of geometry .",

    "although this simulation predicted the structures close to the native one successfully , the backbones structures were fixed to the ideal helix structures . in the present simulation , the flexibility of backbone helix structures is newly taken into account , and 16 replicas were used with the following temperatures : 300 , 333 , 371 , 413 , 460 , 512 , 571 , 635 , 707 , 787 , 877 , 976 , 1087 , 1210 , 1347 , and 1499 k. the total number of mc steps was 60,000,000 . for phospholamban , 16 replicas were also used with the following temperatures : 300 , 340 , 386 , 438 , 497 , 564 , 640 , 727 , 825 , 936 , 1062 , 1205 , 1368 , 1553 , 1762 , and 2000 k. the total number of mc steps was 100,000,000 .",
