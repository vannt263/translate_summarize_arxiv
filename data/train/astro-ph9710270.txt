    "ganga et al . ( 1997a , hereafter grgs ) developed techniques to account for uncertainties , such as those in the beamwidth and calibration , in likelihood analyses of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data .",
    "grgs and ganga et al . (",
    "1997b,1998 ) used these techniques , in conjunction with theoretical cmb anisotropy spectra , in analyses of the ucsb south pole 1994 ( gundersen et al .",

    "bond &   jaffe ( 1997 ) have also analyzed the ucsb south pole 1994 data and the saskatoon ( netterfield et al .",
    "1997 ) data .    in this paper we present a similar analysis of",
    "the tucker et al .",
    "( 1993 , hereafter t93 ) white dish cmb anisotropy data collected at the south pole . the white dish detector and telescope are described in tucker et al .",
    "data were taken in a frequency band centered at 90 ghz .",
    "the fwhm of the beam , assumed to be gaussian , is @xmath3 .",
    "five interlocked circles on the sky , centered at constant elevation and declination , were observed .",
    "the circle centers are separated by @xmath4 on the sky , and each circle intersects at least one neighbour at two points .",
    "the circles , of diameter @xmath5 on the sky , were sampled at 128 equally spaced points .",
    "griffin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) describe the full white dish data set .",
    "t93 analyze a small subset of the white dish data in two different ways , which they refer to as method i and method ii .",
    "they consider only the set of points , at two different elevations , defined by where the interlocking circles intersect .",
    "method i uses two sets of two - beam temperature differences ( one set at each elevation ) . method ii uses a single set of  quadrupole \" temperature differences , obtained by appropriately combining the corresponding two - beam differences at each elevation .",
    "further details are given in t93 .",
    "neither method results in a 2-@xmath1 detection of cmb anisotropy ( t93 ) .",
    "since method ii provides a less restrictive upper limit than does method i , we do not record method ii results here .",
    "method i and method ii use essentially the same cmb anisotropy observations ; they thus can not be combined to provide a tighter upper limit .",
    "t93 remove an offset and linear gradient from each method i scan , prior to binning in right ascension .",
    "t93 and tucker et al . (",
    "1994 ) describe how white dish was calibrated .",

    "we do not record results from the method ii analysis here .",

    "the zero - lag parts of the method i and ii window functions are shown in figure 2 and the window function parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 also shows some of the model cmb anisotropy spectra we use .",
    "these spectra are described in ratra et al .",
    "in addition to the flat bandpower and fiducial cold dark matter ( cdm ) model spectra , we consider spatially open cdm models as well as spatially flat cdm models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the low - density open and flat-@xmath0 models are consistent with most current observations .",

    "the open model computations assume the open - bubble inflation model energy - density spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994,1995 ; bucher , goldhaber , & turok 1995 ; yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1995 ) .",
    "the flat-@xmath0 model computations assume the scale - invariant energy - density power spectrum ( harrison 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "the cmb anisotropy spectra are parameterized by their quadrupole - moment amplitude @xmath18 , the clustered - mass density parameter @xmath19 , the baryonic - mass density parameter @xmath20 , and the hubble parameter @xmath21 [ @xmath22 .",
    "the cosmological parameter values tested were chosen on the basis of consistency with current non - cmb observations ( ratra et al . 1997 ) .",

    "figure 3 shows the moments @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the cmb temperature now , grgs , eqs . [ 5 ] & [ 6 ] ) for the method i window function and the cmb anisotropy spectra of figure 2 .",
    "these moments show the angular scales where the method i experiment is most sensitive , given a cmb anisotropy model ( grgs ) .",
    "examination of the white dish window function by itself ( i.e. , without reference to a cmb anisotropy spectrum ) does not give an accurate indication of the multipoles to which the experiment is sensitive ( table 1 and figure 2 ) .",
    "the computation of the likelihood function is described in grgs .",
    "we assume a uniform prior in the amplitudes of the offset and gradient removed and marginalize over these amplitudes , i.e. , we integrate over all possible offset and gradient amplitudes when determining the likelihood function ( bond et al .",
    "1991 , also see bunn et al .",
    "1994 ; grgs ; church et al . 1997 ; ganga et al .",
    "calibration uncertainty is accounted for as described in grgs .",
    "figure 4 shows the method i likelihood functions for the cmb anisotropy spectra of figure 2 .",
    "these likelihood functions account for all the above additional uncertainties .    in agreement with the conclusion of t93",
    ", there are no 2-@xmath1 detections of anisotropy ( defined using the prescription given in grgs ) .",
    "to derive @xmath18 upper limits we assume a uniform prior in @xmath18 and integrate the posterior probability density distribution function starting from 0 @xmath25k until 95.5% of the area is encompassed .",
    "this is the 2-@xmath1 highest posterior density ( hpd ) prescription ; see grgs for further details .",
    "( the corresponding 2-@xmath1 equal tail limits , e.g. , grgs , are significantly larger and so not recorded here . )",
    "table 2 gives these @xmath18 2-@xmath1 hpd limits , as well as those for bandtemperature @xmath26^{0.5}$ ] .",
    "from table 2 , the method i @xmath27 2-@xmath1 upper limit for the flat bandpower angular spectrum is 150 @xmath25k .",
    "this accounts for the marginalization over the amplitudes of the offset and gradient removed , as well as the calibration uncertainty .",
    "if instead we use a gaussian autocorrelation function ( gacf ) , with a coherence angle of 0.15@xmath28 , to describe the cmb anisotropy , the corresponding bandtemperature @xmath27 limit is 140 @xmath25k , in good agreement with the flat bandpower angular spectrum result . ignoring the marginalization over offset and gradient removed , and the calibration uncertainty , the flat bandpower @xmath27 2-@xmath1 upper limit is 54 @xmath25k .",
    "accounting only for the marginalization over offset and gradient , the flat bandpower @xmath27 2-@xmath1 limit rises to 96 @xmath25k .",
    "these numerical values should be compared to the t93 bandtemperature @xmath27 2-@xmath1 upper limit of 44 @xmath25k , derived for a gacf with a coherence angle of 0.15@xmath28 .",
    "the t93 computation does not account for calibration uncertainty , nor does it account for the marginalization over the amplitudes of the offset and gradient removed from the data .",
    "the white dish method i limits derived here are larger than that of t93 .",
    "the method ii upper limits ( not recorded here ) are larger than those of method i. this is in qualitative agreement with the results of t93 . for all models tested , the white dish @xmath18 2-@xmath1 upper limits derived here are consistent with the dmr detections ( grski et al .",
    "1996,1998 ; stompor 1997 ) .",
    "the limits derived depend sensitively on whether offset and gradient removal are accounted for in the likelihood analysis , and whether calibration uncertainty is included .",
    "there are situations in which the calibration uncertainty need not be included ( for example , when considering the ratio of two different measurements made with the same instrument ) . for comparison with other experiments ,",
    "however , calibration uncertainty must be included .",
    "the variation of the @xmath27 upper limit from model to model gives an indication of the accuracy of the flat bandpower approximation . from table 2",
    "we see that there is a difference of @xmath29 between the two extreme cases .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath30 difference for suzie ( ganga et al .",
    "1997b ) , and larger than the @xmath31 variation for ucsb south pole 1994 and max 4 + 5 ( grgs ; ganga et al .",
    "in our likelihood analyses of the white dish method i cmb anisotropy data we have marginalized over the amplitudes of the offset and gradient removed from the data , and have explicitly accounted for calibration uncertainty .",
    "there are no 2-@xmath1 detections of anisotropy for the models tested , in agreement with the conclusion of t93 . as a consequence of the additional effects accounted for here ,",
    "the limits we have derived are less restrictive than those derived by t93 .",
    "these limits are consistent with the @xmath2-dmr anisotropy amplitudes for the models tested .",
    "hence , contrary to earlier assertions ( e.g. , ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; ratra et al .",
    "1997 ) , the t93 white dish data subset does not seriously constrain cosmological parameter values for reasonable dmr - normalized models .",
