    "rotation curves ( hereafter rcs ) of spiral galaxies do not show any keplerian fall - off : this implies the presence of an invisible mass component ( rubin et al .",
    "1980 ; bosma 1981 ; see salucci and persic , 1997 ) .",
    "more precisely , the mass _ distribution _ of stars and gas does not match that of the gravitating matter ( persic and salucci 1988 , persic , salucci and stel , 1996 , hereafter pss , see also corbelli and salucci , 1999 ) ; the discrepancy increases with increasing radius and , at a given radius measured in units of disk length - scales @xmath3 , it increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity ( persic & salucci 1988 , 1990a , b ; broeils 1992 ) .      where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in ( 1b ) the range is @xmath9 and the r.m.s . is 0.05 ( see pss and fig 1 ) ) . as the reference disk scale to follow pss .",
    "we can use any other multiple of @xmath3 to specify the urc : no result of this paper changes .",
    "the urc for the whole range of available data , @xmath10 , is given in pss ] notice that we will freely interchange luminosities and @xmath7 , given their high degree of correlation .",
    "the analysis of the urc and/or of individual rc has provided crucial knoweledge on the main _ global _ properties of the dark and luminous matter ( e. g. salucci & persic , 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "to invesatigate the local properties of the dark halos ( e.g. the central density ) is quite difficult , especially for luminous matter ( lm ) dominated objects ( van albada et al 1985 , but see the exception of high - resolution rc s , borriello and salucci , 2000 ) .",
    "however , as a result of recent substantial observational and theoretical progress , a proper investigation of the spiral s halos mass structure is now possible .",
    "in fact , from the study of a large number of high - quality rc s recently available ( persic & salucci , 1995 ) it has emerged that :    _ i ) _ the dark matter follows a regime of inner baryon dominance ( ibd ) according to which in every normal spiral there is a _ transition _ radius @xmath11 @xmath12 inside which the luminous matter totally accounts for the whole mass distribution ( see ratnam and salucci 2000 , salucci and persic 1999ab , salucci et al , 2000 ) .",
    "this allows us to address the issue of the degeneracy problem raised by van albada , et al .",
    "( 1985 ) : the urc ( and individual rotation curves ) _ do _ show , in their profile , the kinematical signature of a transition between an inner lm - dominated region and an outer dm - dominated one ( e.g. salucci and persic , 1999b ) .",
    "_ ii ) _ dark halos are distributed very differently from the various `` luminous '' components ( corbelli and salucci , 1999 ) .",
    "these findings allow us 1 ) to improve the determination of the disk mass to the level required for investigating the dm distribution and 2 ) to relate the dark halos around galaxies to collision - less non - baryonic cosmological structures .",
    "the aim of this letter is to derive , for a large and complete sample of spirals , the density profile of the dark halos at the edge of the disks which are embedded in them and reveal dark constant - density regions of obvious cosmological importance .",
    "the evidence for core radii of dm halos , obtained so far by means of mass modeling of a ( small ) number of dm - dominated rc s ( e.g. flores and primack 1994 , moore 1994 , burkert 1995 ) , is being questioned in the light of the intrinsic uncertainty of the analysis itself ( burkert and silk , 1997 , van den bosch 1999 ) . in many cases , in fact , the standard rc fitting method has difficulty in discriminating a nfw ( navarro , frenk and white , 1996 ) density profile , which has @xmath13 in the center , from a constant - density one , with @xmath14 .",
    "we tackle this issue by resorting to the method of persic and salucci ( 1990b ) in which the power law slope of the dark halo velocity at the disk edge is derived by means of a robust and straightforward procedure , which ultimately exploits the fact that , at @xmath15 , the dark halo is always the main _ density _ component , even when it is a negligible _ mass _ component at about @xmath0 .    in detail ,",
    "the goal of this letter is to detect a clear and reliable feature of the dark matter distribution , relevant on its own and ( probably ) at variance with the structural properties of _ standard _ cdm halos .",
    "let us stress that the issue of establishing the actual cdm halo properties , or that of investigating whether non - standard cdm scenarios may be in agreement with observations , are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the plan of this letter is the following : in section 2 we describe the rc sample and we derive the local dm slope @xmath16 for all of the objects , in section 3 we compare the observed halo mass distributions with the cdm prediction and comment on our main results .",
    "let us start from the condition of rotational equilibrium : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , with obvious notation , is the quadratic sum of the three `` luminous '' components : gas , disk , and bulge .",
    "we define @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in late type spirals , the exponential thin disk ( of mass @xmath21 )",
    "is by far the main contributor to @xmath22 , at @xmath23 ( e.g. verheijen , 1997 ; rhee , 1997 ; persic , salucci & ashman , 1993 ) , and so @xmath24 with : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the modified bessel functions of @xmath28-order , and using the previous definitions , @xmath29 , the dm velocity contribution at @xmath2 is given by @xmath30    let us define : @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath16 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 in the same way of the l.h.s of equation ( 6a ) when @xmath35 is substituted by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( the subscripts @xmath39 refer to halo , gas and bulge respectively ) . in view of the argument _ ii ) _ in the previous section , we can identify @xmath40 with the contribution of a non - baryonic dark component .    from the previous eqs .",
    "@xmath41 for a bulge - less gas - free spiral , @xmath42 from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 6a ) . in this case , given its definition and the self - similarity of spiral disks , @xmath43 is strictly a constant .",
    "the contribution of bulge to @xmath44 can be totally neglected ( see persic , salucci and ashman , ( 1993 ) for details ) while that of the gaseus disk can be evaluated in spirals with hi measurements : in a large sample ( rhee , 1997 ) we find that typically @xmath45 , and @xmath46 that leads to @xmath47 . for a sub - sample of the present sample we have ( pss ) : @xmath48 it is worth to stress that no result of this paper changes 1)by assuming @xmath43 according to eq ( 7a ) rather than to eq ( 7b ) , or 2)by neglecting the ( small ) variance of @xmath43 among spirals .    by differentiating eq .",
    "( 3a ) we arrive to ( persic & salucci 1990b ) : @xmath49 which expresses the dm halo velocity slope in terms of the rc slope and of the lm mass fraction at @xmath2 .",
    "note that , for high - quality rc s ( @xmath50 ) , the estimate of @xmath16 from eq ( 8) is very robust . in fact , in dm dominated objects , ( @xmath51 ) , the uncertainties on @xmath52 do not affect the estimate of @xmath16 , while in lm - dominated objects , ( @xmath53 ) , a reasonably good knowledge of @xmath52 : @xmath54 suffices to estimate @xmath16 within a reasonable uncertainty ( i.e. @xmath55 ) .",
    "once we include the radial dependences of all the quantities , eq ( 8) is in principle valid at any radius .",
    "however , for @xmath56 , @xmath57 very quickly , so that even a small error in @xmath52 or @xmath58 will strongly affect the estimate of @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath60 , the number of available rc s rapidly decreases .",
    "the sample of rc s we use in this letter is presented in pss and salucci and persic ( 1997 ) .",
    "it includes 131 rotation curves of spirals and 6 for dwarfs , all with a reliable profile out to @xmath2 .",
    "this has been ensured by the following selection criteria : each rc _ ( a ) _ extends out to a @xmath61 ; _ ( b ) _ has at least 30 velocity measurements distributed homogeneously with radius and between the two arms ; and _ ( c ) _ shows no asymmetries or non - circular motions . for 21-cm rcs",
    "we require that the beam - size should be @xmath62 in order to limit the uncertainties due to beam smearing .",
    "incidentally , no lsb rc is found to satisfy these conditions , and this points to an intrinsic difficulty in studying these objects .",
    "the values of the @xmath63 are estimated by fitting with eq ( 1 ) each of the 137 rc s of the sample : the related uncertainty is small : @xmath64 ; the values of @xmath65 , @xmath58 and @xmath66 , are given in tables 1 and 3 of pss and shown in fig ( 1 ) as function of @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth to point out that _ a ) _ the range of @xmath58 _ along _ the luminosity sequence is large , @xmath67 , while , the corresponding r.m.s .",
    ", _ at a given _ luminosity is small @xmath68 : the dm properties are likely to vary with galaxy global properties rather than random , _ b ) _ we do not assume the urc ( i.e. eq .",
    "( 1b ) ) : the values of @xmath58 are derived from each rc .",
    "the lm fraction @xmath52 is derived as in salucci and persic ( 1999a ) , salucci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and ratnam & salucci ( 2000 ) , i.e. by fitting the inner parts of each rotation curve , ( @xmath69 ) , with ( only ) the circular velocity of an exponential thin disk given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) .. in this region , the only - disk mass model reproduces , with no free parameters , the _",
    "normalized _ rotation curve @xmath70 and , with a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath52 , the full curve @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown for coadded rc s in figure ( 3 ) and for individual rc s in salucci et al .",
    ", ( 2000 ) and in ratnam and salucci ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "the excellent match we always find leads to very precise determinations of @xmath52 s ; in fact , the @xmath71 fitting uncertainties are quite modest , @xmath72 .",
    "let us notice that the present method does not assume a `` maximum disk '' solution , rather , it is intimely related with the idea that the mass distribution in spirals follows the regime of inner baryon dominance proposed by salucci & persic , ( 1999b ) and then supported by ratnam & salucci , 2000 and salucci et al , 2000 .",
    "finally , the present method computes @xmath16 independently of the value of the disk mass - to - light ratio whose uncertainty , , this is @xmath73 large in dm - dominated objects , is therefore irrelevant for the aim of this work .",
    "the disk mass fraction @xmath52 correlates tightly with @xmath58 ( see fig ( 2 ) ) .",
    "in addition , at a fixed @xmath65 , part of its scatter originates from observational errors and then it is unrelated to a cosmic variance of the halo mass distribution . in any case , conservatively , we derive the r.m.s . of the above relation by performing the usual least squares",
    "fit @xmath74 a relationship like eq .",
    "( 9 ) has been found from the mass modelling of ( smaller samples of ) spirals ( e.g. persic and salucci 1988 ; 1990a ; 1990b ) ; it can be considered as the basic law of the dark - luminous coupling in galaxies ( see salucci , 1997 ) .",
    "we derive the values of @xmath16 for the objects of our sample by setting @xmath75 and inserting in eq ( 8) the corresponding values of @xmath52 and @xmath58 . in fig",
    "( 4 ) they are plotted as a function of @xmath76 : we immediately realize that @xmath16 is roughly constant over the whole sample and it shows no systematic variations along the luminosity sequence .",
    "such variations , if present , should have clearly appeared given the high - precision measurement of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact the uncertainties @xmath77 on @xmath52 propagate into eq ( 8) in a modest way , as it can be realized by differentiating eq ( 8) and combining it with eq ( 9 ) to get @xmath78    the average value found for @xmath79 indicates that , at @xmath2 , the halo rc is steeply increasing , marginally compatible with a solid body law , @xmath80 . consequently , around @xmath2",
    ", the halo density must decrease with radius less steeply than @xmath81 . by assuming a pseudo - isothermal density distribution , @xmath82",
    ", it follows that @xmath83 , i.e. a core radius significantly larger than @xmath3 , the size of region where the bulk of the stellar component is located .",
    "we stress the robustness of this result by noticing that , from eq ( 8) , crucially lower values of @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath84 ) are possible only in the particular combination of a `` flat '' rc , ( i.e. for @xmath85 ) _ and _ a `` light disk '' ( i. e. @xmath86 ) .",
    "also this extreme case , however , must be ruled out since such a flat rc can not be fitted by a mass model with ( @xmath52 , @xmath16 ) less than or equal to ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) .",
    "( salucci and persic , 1999b ) .",
    "we have investigated the mass distribution of dm halos for a large number of spirals in a way which is complementary to the mass modeling of dm - dominated rotation curves .",
    "this method has been applied to rc s of galaxies of all luminosities , including the most luminous ones for which the standard mass modeling is quite uncertain . in detail , for each halo we have derived a single but most crucial structural property , namely , its velocity slope at @xmath2 .",
    "the results are impressive : the halo mass profiles at @xmath2 turn out to be _",
    "i ) _ independent of the galaxy properties , _ ii ) _ universal and _ iii ) _ essentially featureless in the sense that for any spiral the stellar disk is embedded within a constant density sphere .",
    "high - resolution simulations and analytical studies of the cold dark matter scenario have pointed to a universal halo density profile ( navarro , frenk and white , 1996 ) @xmath89 , with @xmath90 being a function of the dark halo mass @xmath91 , of the assumed cosmological parameters , and of the red - shift of formation of the halo .",
    "moreover , halos with identical values of the above quantities , can still have different @xmath90 if formed at various red - shifts and/or assembled through different merging histories .",
    "in detail , the circular velocity of a cdm halo is given by : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , is the concentration parameter , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the halo virial radius defined by @xmath96 .    before proceeding further let us notice that we will test the cdm halos at @xmath2 , where the baryon infall has not significantly altered the original dm halo _ velocity profile _",
    ": @xmath2 is external to the region into which most of the baryons have collapsed ( blumenthal et al , 1986 ) .",
    "violent dark halos - baryonic matter couplings , such as those proposed by navarro et al , ( 1996 ) and gelato and sommer - larsen , ( 1998 ) can instead modify the original halo distribution everywhere ; however , given the very heuristic nature of these processes , it is best to first compare the standard - infall cdm halos with the galactic halo , and then to consider the possibly emerging discrepancies in terms of new theoretical scenarios .",
    "the highest possible value for @xmath97 is @xmath88 , that is achieved on the @xmath98 scale only for @xmath99 ( see bullock et al . 1999 and navarro , 1998 ) , i.e. for low values of the concentration parameter , a property of low-@xmath100 universes .",
    "this value is quite inconsistent with the average value found in spiral dark halos , especially if one considers that high resolution n - body simulations converge to a maximum value of @xmath101 ( moore et al , 1998 ) .    of crucial importance",
    "is also the absence of a significant scatter in the @xmath16 vs. @xmath76 relationship .",
    "in fact , the cdm theory predicts that , in a very wide region centered at @xmath102 and certainly including @xmath2 independently of its relation with the virial radius , galactic halos with the same mass do not follow a unique velocity curve but a family of them .",
    "these can be described by a set of straight - lines with slopes varying between @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( e.g. see fig 6 of bullock et al , 1999 ) . according to cdm the @xmath105 plane",
    "should be filled well beyond the tiny strip of fig ( 4 ) . taken at its face value , the observational constraint variance ( @xmath106 ) could imply , within the cdm scenario , that protospiral halos are co - eval and have similar merging histories",
    ". a second possibility may be that the disk lenght - scale @xmath2 , in units of virial radius , is _ strongly _ coupled with the structure of the dark matter halo .",
    "( e.g. , mo , mao & white 1998 ; dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "1999 , but see also bullock et al , 1999 ) .",
    "the sizes of the dm core radii turn out to be very large , at least @xmath107 , and independent of galaxy luminosity and dm mass fraction .",
    "this may pose a problem for the suggestion that they were formed through some luminous - dark dynamical coupling and it may call or for a primordial origin for these `` warm '' regions of constant density embedding the luminous matter or for some dissipative self - regulating \" process .    burkert ( 1995 ) and salucci & burkert ( 2000 ) , from the analysis of individual rc s and of the urc , have proposed that the dm halos around disk systems follow the distribution : @xmath108 , i.e. an nfw profile at large radii which converges to a constant value at inner radii . the core radius ,",
    "@xmath109 is found to increase from 5 kpc to 30 kpc , as @xmath65 increases form @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "this implies f or the dm halo : @xmath112 almost independently of @xmath65 and in very good agreement with the halo slope determinations of fig ( 3 ) .",
    "then , since the derived density distribution of galaxy halos is quite different from the theoretical one out to the outermost velocity data available ( see also corbelli and salucci , 1999 ; salucci & burkert , 2000 ) , we should seriously begin to consider the possibility that cosmological processes have cut the link between the initial conditions and the present - day galaxies properties .",
