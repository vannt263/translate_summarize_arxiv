    "on 1998 march 25 , nasa administrator daniel goldin approved the initiation of final design and construction for the _ space infrared telescope facility _ ( _ sirtf _ ; fanson et al .",
    "1998 ) . with launch planned for december 2001 , _",
    "sirtf _ will complete nasa s family of great observatories .",
    "_ sirtf _ will provide a large increase in sensitivity over previous missions across its 3200  operating range , and over 75% of the observing time during its 2.5year - minimum lifetime will be awarded to general investigators . a call for legacy proposals ( large projects of both immediate scientific interest and lasting archival value , and with no proprietary data period )",
    "is planned for july of 2000 .",
    "one of the defining scientific programs for _ sirtf _ is the study of galaxies to @xmath1 by means of deep surveys at 310 .",
    "this limit was selected because it is apparently beyond the peak in the space density of luminous quasars ( schmidt , schneider , & gunn 1995 ) .",
    "not only will _ sirtf _ s excellent sensitivity in this wavelength region allow such galaxies to be detected with the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "1998 ) , but the h@xmath2 opacity minimum at 1.6  ( john 1988 ) is expected to be a major tool in photometric redshift determination at @xmath3 ( wright , eisenhardt & fazio 1994 ) , since it is a ubiquitous feature of stellar atmospheres .",
    "uv - bright examples of such galaxies have already been detected by means of the `` uv dropout '' technique ( steidel & hamilton 1992 , 1993 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) and they play an important role in the overall star formation history of the universe ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) . by detecting galaxies on the strength of their uv emission , however ,",
    "uv dropout samples are necessarily biased in favor of those with both active star formation and relatively modest extinction .",
    "such samples will not reveal if there is an underlying population of galaxies which have already assembled the bulk of their stellar mass . in the absence of ongoing star formation",
    ", even massive galaxies will be too faint in the rest - frame ultraviolet to be picked up by optical surveys .",
    "the stellar mass already present at an early epoch constrains the star formation rate to that point , a quantity which is still uncertain due to the possibility of significant dust extinction .",
    "steidel et al.(1998 ) suggest that `` the onset of substantial star formation activity in galaxies occurs at @xmath4 '' , and estimate the net extinction correction to the star formation rate derived from uv dropouts to be a factor of about 5 .",
    "recent far - infrared detections of the cosmic background ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) , and far - infrared and submillimeter detections of field galaxies with iso and scuba ( kawara et al .  1998 ;",
    "puget et al .  1999 ; barger et al .  1998 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) also hint at a heavily dust enshrouded starburst population .",
    "hence an accurate picture of the star formation history of the universe can only be determined by making an accurate census of _ all _ galaxies , not just star - forming ones with low extinction . since the luminosity in the rest - frame",
    "near - infrared correlates linearly with mass ( gavazzi , peirini & boselli 1996 ) and is relatively unaffected by dust obscuration , this is clearly the spectral region in which to make such a census .    in this paper",
    "we examine changing the specifications of the irac filters in order to optimize them for the study of @xmath0 galaxies , including photometric redshift determination .",
    "irac will have two detector arrays made from indium antimonide ( insb ) which is sensitive to @xmath5  photons , and two made from arsenic - doped silicon ( si : as ) which detects longer - wavelength light .",
    "all four arrays will have a @xmath6 format , with 12 pixels , and will operate simultaneously .",
    "the insb arrays will have filters centered at 3.63  with 20.4% bandwidth and at 4.53  with 23.3% bandwidth .",
    "we shall refer to these filters as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , because of their similarity to the filters used in ground - based facilities . the filters for the si : as arrays have no ground - based analogs , since they cover wavelengths where the atmosphere is opaque , and so we refer to them as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath9 being the bluer of the two .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath9 filters share one field and are separated by a dichroic filter , while the @xmath8 and @xmath10 filters similarly share a second nearly adjacent field .",
    "the original , or `` baseline '' , specifications for @xmath9 and @xmath10 are 25% bandwidth filters centered at 6.3 and 8.0",
    ". our analysis will involve comparing the performance of different pairs of filters , and we distinguish between these pairs by the use of subscripts , so for example the baseline filters described above are called @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also introduce the notation @xmath13 $ ] to describe a filter which extends from @xmath14  to @xmath15 . in this notation ,",
    "the @xmath7 filter is @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] , and @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the calculations in this paper all assume a total integration time of 10hours per point ( made up of many individual 200second exposures ) , which allows a deep image of a large area of sky to be obtained in a sensible integration time . for such exposure times , irac requires background - limited operation and therefore we neglect read noise and dark current .",
    "confusion noise will be discussed in  5.1 but is otherwise not considered here . as _",
    "sirtf _ is required to be diffraction limited at 6.5 , we adopt a detection area of twenty pixels , independent of wavelength , and assume that all the source flux is contained within this region .      the fraction of photons incident upon _ sirtf _ s 85 cm diameter aperture which reach the irac detectors is specified in the _ sirtf _ observatory performance and interface control document and the irac instrument performance requirements document , and is about 50% , including filter transmission . the insb quantum efficiency ( qe ) is assumed to be 80% over the entire wavelength range of the two insb filters .",
    "the qe of the si : as arrays is based on the average of laboratory measurements made on a number of flight - candidate arrays coated with anti - reflection coatings of either sio or zns . due to the high opacity of sio beyond 8 , in the following analysis",
    "we assume that the zns coating will be used in preference to the sio coating if the filter bandpass extends beyond 8 .",
    "the net result of these assumptions is a qe of approximately 6065% for the two si : as filters .",
    "we also assume that the various filters considered here are opaque outside their nominal wavelength region .      from the picd ,",
    "the minimum _ sirtf _ background ( which occurs at the ecliptic pole for wavelengths considered here ) , @xmath20 ) is computed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the planck function for a temperature of @xmath23k .",
    "the first term is due to scattered sunlight from zodiacal dust , the second and third terms to thermal emission from zodiacal and galactic dust , respectively , and the final term is the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "this function provides an excellent fit to data from the dirbe instrument ( hauser 1996 ) .",
    "our analysis is concerned with the detection of high redshift galaxies .",
    "we construct model spectra of such galaxies using the gissel96 spectral synthesis code ( bruzual & charlot 1993 , 1998 ; see also charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 )",
    ". this code does not include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features at 3.3  and beyond , but at @xmath24 these features are at observed wavelengths beyond the range considered here .",
    "we will return to the pah features when we discuss confusion noise .",
    "we adopt a conservative ( in the sense of making @xmath0 galaxies faint ) cosmology with @xmath25kms@xmath26mpc@xmath26 and @xmath27 , corresponding to a present age of the universe of 16.5gyr ( at @xmath28 the universe is 2.9 gyr old ) .",
    "we assume a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf extending from 0.1125@xmath29 , and normalize our galaxies to have @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ; gardner et al .",
    "1997 ) at an age of 16.5gyr .",
    "we use four models to represent the limits of galaxy evolution .",
    "model a is a maximally old model with solar metallicity formed in an instantaneous burst at @xmath32 and evolving passively thereafter .",
    "model b is like a but with metallicity only @xmath33 solar .",
    "as we show in  3.3 , these types of galaxies will not appear in uv dropout samples .",
    "model c is a young solar metallicity galaxy formed with a constant star formation rate over the 100myr prior to whatever redshift is considered ( i.e.  a young nonevolving spectrum ) .",
    "model d is like c , but again with @xmath34 .",
    "models c and d are much more luminous than models a and b at @xmath24 , and are representative of the spectra expected for uv - dropout galaxies . the rest frame ultraviolet ",
    "infrared spectra of these four models at @xmath24 are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .    the only feature common to all these spectra is a change in slope at 1.6 , due to the h@xmath2 opacity minimum ,",
    "although this is barely discernable in model d. it is in fact the only feature in the two low - metallicity models , which lack the prominent co bandhead at 2.3  and the effects of metal line blanketing at rest - frame optical wavelengths .",
    "this therefore makes it a suitable feature for use in photometric redshift determination , a technique whereby an approximate redshift can be inferred from observed colors as one or more spectral features pass through broad - band filters ( e.g. , hogg et al .",
    "since _ sirtf _ s observations will be dominated by general observer programs , it is important to consider performance independent of any particular program , in addition to the high redshift galaxy observations which drive the filter recommendations made here .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in  6 , the pair of filters which provide the optimum performance for @xmath35 color selection and photometric redshift determination at @xmath0 are not very suitable for other science programs .",
    "for this reason we will throughout the course of this paper be discussing the relative performance of three different si : as filter pairs , which we designate `` baseline '' , `` optimum '' , and `` preferred '' and denote by subscripts @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the baseline filters are the two 25% bandwidth filters centered at 6.3 and 8.0 , the optimum filters provide the most accurate @xmath35 color selection and photometric redshift determination ( see  4 ) at @xmath0 , and the preferred filters give slightly poorer performance in these areas , but are expected to be much more useful for other scientific programs .",
    "the optimum filters are @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] , and the preferred filters are @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : limflux ] is a contour plot of irac s background limited @xmath43 sensitivity in 10hours of integration as a function of filter cuton and cutoff wavelength for a source which has a flat spectrum in @xmath44 .",
    "since the contour lines are fairly vertical , it is evident that the cuton wavelength is more important than the cutoff .",
    "it is also clear from this figure that the best sensitivity is achieved for a very blue filter whose short wavelength cuton will be constrained by the dichroic response . within the parameter space plotted , a @xmath45 $ ] filter is most sensitive , with a @xmath43 10hr limiting flux of @xmath46jy .",
    "however , this filter overlaps the insb @xmath8 filter almost entirely , and since insb has a higher quantum efficiency there is little point in duplicating it .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to filters with @xmath47  ( the cutoff of the @xmath8 filter ) . the second column in table  [ tab : snr ]",
    "lists the sensitivity achieved by various irac filters for a flat spectrum source .",
    "the most sensitive si : as filter is @xmath48 $ ] but , as remarked above , the sensitivity is largely independent of the cutoff wavelength , dropping only 1% if we reduce the cutoff to 7  or raise it to 8.3 .",
    "the optimum and preferred filters have a @xmath49% gain in sensitivity over the baseline specifications for a flat spectrum source .",
    "figure  [ fig : plaw ] shows that the improvement holds for a fairly large range of spectral shapes , with the preferred @xmath50 filter only losing out to the baseline @xmath11 filter for spectra redder than @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , due to the longer wavelength of the @xmath11 filter .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr3 ] plots the snr achievable in 10 hours through si : as filters for the four galaxy models at @xmath24 .",
    "again the contours are fairly vertical showing the cuton wavelength is important and the snr achievable is very insensitive to the cutoff . the best snr at @xmath24 for a si : as filter is again with the bluest wavelength cuton allowed ( 5.06 ) and with a cutoff of 7.4 , 6.1 , 7.2 , and 6.7  for models a , b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : snr ] lists the signal - to - noise ratios achievable at @xmath24 for the various si : as filter choices .",
    "the general conclusions thus far are that substantial improvements in sensitivity can be achieved over the baseline filter specifications by using a bluer @xmath9 filter and a broader @xmath10 filter .",
    "we show that this applies over a broad range of redshift in figures  [ fig : snr_a ] and [ fig : snr_b ] , which plot the signal - to - noise ratio achievable in 10hours for the three different filter pairs . for completeness",
    ", we show the snr achievable through the two insb filters as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig : snr_insb ] . the higher quantum efficiency of insb and the lower background at short wavelengths produce an order of magnitude increase over what is achievable with the two si : as arrays , but the need for the si : as arrays will become clear in  4 .      the advantage in using _",
    "sirtf _ to obtain an effectively mass - limited sample of high - redshift galaxies has already been stated . here",
    ", we compare the sensitivities calculated above to the limits obtained , or obtainable , by other methods .    in table",
    "[ tab : sens ] , we first list the limits obtained , or obtainable , by deep exposures in the optical  infrared region . in figure",
    "[ fig : mags ] , we present the observed flux of a solar metallicity @xmath24 @xmath31 galaxy , which was formed in an instantaneous burst , through three different _ hst _ filters and our preferred irac filters , as a function of age .",
    "these fluxes correspond to model a where they intersect the right axis . from this , it is clear that optical selection methods , such as the `` uv dropout '' technique , can only find galaxies which have undergone substantial star formation since @xmath53 ( i.e. , similar to models c and d ) , as passive evolution since then will cause their uv flux to drop below a plausible detection threshold .",
    "near - infrared observations fare rather better , although it should be noted that the nicmos hdf catalogue suffers significant incompleteness even at high signal - to - noise ratios ( the 80% completeness limit is @xmath54 in both filters ; thompson et al .  1998 ) .",
    "this f160w limit is sensitive enough to detect old , sub-@xmath31 galaxies , and is comparable to the irac filters in this respect .",
    "however , the f110w filter , by virtue of its sampling a region below the 4000  break , is far less sensitive , and obviously there is limited science which can be done from a single detection in one filter .",
    "in addition , the short rest - frame wavelengths which these filters probe are strongly affected by dust obscuration",
    ". irac will therefore be the first instrument capable of detecting distant , evolved @xmath31 ( and possibly even sub-@xmath31 ) galaxies , if they exist , at more than one wavelength . as a comparison",
    ", we note that the deepest observations obtained by isocam with the very wide lw-2 filter ( 5.08.5 ) produced a much higher @xmath43 limit of approximately 30@xmath55jy in 6 hours of integration ( 13 hours of observation ; taniguchi et al .",
    "in this section we present the analysis which defines the `` optimum '' filters and leads to our specifications for the `` preferred '' filters .",
    "two factors are important in deciding upon the best filters for photometric redshift determination .",
    "first , it is necessary to achieve a high signal - to - noise ratio in both filters , to allow the color to be determined accurately .",
    "this was discussed in the previous section .",
    "secondly , this color must be a strong function of redshift , since the uncertainty in redshift , @xmath56 , is related to the uncertainty in the color , @xmath57 ( the color defined in the sense @xmath58 ) by @xmath59    figure  [ fig : colz ] plots the @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath35 colors as a function of redshift for the four models .",
    "magnitudes in each of the filters have been determined with respect to vega ( which we model as a 9400k blackbody with a 2.2  flux of 657jy ) .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath62 , the 3.3  pah feature may affect the results since it will lie in the bandpass of filter @xmath10 .",
    "it is apparent that the @xmath63 color is sensitive to redshift in the range @xmath64 ( see the divergence between the @xmath60 and @xmath61 loci over this redshift range ) , due to the 1.6  bump moving through the filters . at higher redshifts",
    "the si : as filters become increasingly important for measuring photometric redshifts . at @xmath65 , the increased separation between the preferred and optimum @xmath9 and @xmath10 filters , compared to the baseline filters , causes them to produce larger color variations .",
    "coupled with the increased sensitivity that these filters provide , it is clear that they will be able to produce more accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "we now quantify the level of this improvement .",
    "the goal of photometric redshift determination is to minimize the uncertainty in the derived redshift , given by equation  [ eqn : dz ] .",
    "we make a few approximations to ease the calculation of this function .",
    "first , we write @xmath66 , and make use of the fact that for well - detected ( @xmath67 ) sources , the uncertainty in the measured magnitude @xmath68 , where snr is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we approximate the snr ( which varies slightly with redshift ) as the geometric mean of the actual snr at @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in light of these rather crude approximations",
    ", we do not claim to be deriving accurate values of @xmath71 , but instead present its reciprocal , which we call @xmath72 ( by plotting the reciprocal , we also avoid the infinities which arise when the color change between @xmath69 and @xmath70 is zero ) . for any two filters , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath72 is therefore defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total number of background counts and @xmath77 the total number of object counts in filter @xmath78 for a galaxy at redshift @xmath79 .",
    "large values of @xmath72 are desired , and for photometric redshifts accurate to 10% at @xmath0 ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 is necessary .",
    "we wish to find the specifications for the two si : as filters that maximize @xmath82 . unfortunately , since each filter needs two parameters to specify it , it is impossible to graphically present the results of this four - parameter optimization in a simple form .",
    "we therefore first consider the value of @xmath72 for a single si : as filter and the insb @xmath8 filter ( the results are broadly similar if the @xmath7 filter is used instead of @xmath8 )",
    ". figure  [ fig : cont_m ] is a contour plot of @xmath72 for the @xmath8 filter and an arbitrary si : as filter whose specifications are given by the two axes .",
    "this figure favors a si : as filter centered at @xmath83  with @xmath84% bandwidth .",
    "note that the contours are predominantly horizontal here , so that contrary to the snr case , the long wavelength cutoff is the most important parameter .",
    "a broad , long wavelength filter is optimum for determining photometric redshifts at @xmath0 even though the snr it produces is not maximal .",
    "we find the solution to the four - parameter optimization by performing a grid search throughout the available parameter space .",
    "we find that , irrespective of the particular galaxy model , the @xmath9 filter always has the bluest cuton allowed ( 5.06 ) .",
    "this is to be expected , since a blue @xmath9 filter produces both high signal - to - noise ( figures  [ fig : limflux ] and [ fig : snr3 ] ) and a large color change over the redshift range of interest .",
    "the other parameters vary slightly between the four galaxy models , but an average solution is @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "this is the how we define the `` optimum '' filter choice referred to throughout this paper .",
    "the optimum @xmath10 filter has a similar specification regardless of whether the color is formed using @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 as the second filter .",
    "table  [ tab : f ] lists the values of @xmath72 achieved for various pairs of filters . in terms of the value of this function , the optimum filters can produce an increase of as much as 60% in the accuracy of the photometric redshifts derived from the @xmath9 and @xmath10 filters , and a more modest ( but still substantial ) 20% improvement in accuracy when one of the insb filters is used in conjunction with the @xmath10 filter .    as an illustration of how photometric",
    "redshifts might be derived from irac data , in figure  [ fig : colcol ] we present a @xmath63 _ vs _ @xmath87 color - color plot for the four galaxy models in the redshift range @xmath88 .",
    "it can be seen that the color in the two si : as filters is generally able to provide an excellent measurement of the galaxy redshift for @xmath89 . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the @xmath91 color provides most of the photometric redshift signal .",
    "only model d has a very limited range of colors which might hamper analysis , since we are observing the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail of a recent starburst with only weak metal line blanketing ; however , this is exactly the sort of uv - bright galaxy which would be detected in surveys for uv dropouts , and so this does not pose a problem .",
    "finally , we consider the impact of filter changes on two important aspects of distant galaxy detection which we have thus far ignored : confusion noise , which will ultimately limit _ sirtf _ s sensitivity , and dust , which is not included in the bruzual & charlot spectral synthesis models .      confusion noise is expected to limit irac sensitivity to @xmath92jy ( @xmath93 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1991 ) , although this number is quite uncertain and model - dependent .",
    "the confusion noise also depends on the source density and the beam size , both of which are wavelength dependent",
    ". of particular concern is how much the density of confusing sources will increase over the baseline filter with a new @xmath10 filter , due to a longer cutoff wavelength .",
    "the longer cutoff may significantly increase confusion because it includes the strong , broad 7.7  pah feature ( e.g.  uchida , sellgren & werner 1998 ) out to @xmath94 , a large enough distance that substantial volume is sampled and evolving dwarf galaxies may dominate the counts .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) estimate the density of sources at 6.7 , and their prediction of @xmath95arcmin@xmath96 above a flux level of 30@xmath55jy is consistent with taniguchi et al.s ( 1997 ) detection of 15 such sources in a @xmath97 field . at microjansky flux levels",
    ", most sources will be at @xmath98 , so we use the spectrum @xmath99 displayed at rest wavelengths @xmath100  to convert a limiting 8  flux to a 6.7  flux .",
    "our best estimate of the total number of sources above @xmath101jy at 8  is therefore @xmath102arcmin@xmath96 , which is @xmath103 sources per 20pixel detection area .",
    "we estimate the number of pah - emitting galaxies from the cirrus / photodissociation region spectrum and local 15luminosity function of xu et al .",
    "even with very strong ( @xmath104 ) evolution , the number of sources with @xmath105 above 0.5@xmath55jy is no more than @xmath106arcmin@xmath96 , a small fraction of the total confusing source density .",
    "we also note that the longer cutoff wavelength of the new @xmath107 filter does not produce a significant increase in the diffraction - limited beam size for a range of spectral slopes , compared to the @xmath12 filter ( gautier , private communication ) .",
    "the confusion noise will therefore not be increased and the overall performance of the filter will not be affected .",
    "finally , we note that the confusion noise limit of 0.5@xmath55jy would limit the ultimate values obtainable for @xmath108 ( as defined in equation  2 ) to 3.2 , 1.5 , 34 , and 3.7 for models a , b , c , and d , respectively . in the confusion - limited case , where the photometric accuracy is largely independent of the filter choice",
    ", it can be argued that one should attempt to maximize the product of the photometric redshift accuracy and the sky area which can be surveyed in a given time .",
    "this produces slightly different specifications for the optimum @xmath10 filter ( [ 6.0:10.1 ] instead of [ 6.3:10.2 ] ) although the arguments of  6 lead to the same final choice of ` preferred ' filters .",
    "nearby starburst galaxies , e.g.  m  82 and arp  220 , are very dusty and have red near - infrared spectra , as well as strong pah emission features .",
    "our choice of a bluer @xmath9 filter might therefore impair our ability to detect similar objects at high redshift , which would be cosmologically very interesting .",
    "figure  [ fig : plaw ] shows that for spectra redder than @xmath51 , the @xmath11 filter is more sensitive than @xmath50 . in figure  [ fig : m82_arp220 ] we show the sensitivities of the three different filter pairs to these two starburst galaxies as a function of redshift ( the spectrum of m  82 has been scaled up by a factor of 10 in luminosity in this figure ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions required to make these figures were produced with photometric data culled from a variety of sources , and aperture matching using curve - of - growth analysis was required .",
    "this is likely to produce errors where the spectral region sampled by a given filter includes the transition between different datasets ( e.g.optical and near - infrared ) , and the signal - to - noise ratios ( both absolute and relative ) should probably not be trusted to more than @xmath109% .",
    "given these caveats , there is little to choose between the different @xmath9 filters , but the sensitivity improvement offered by the @xmath107 filter is unambiguous .",
    "although the broad @xmath110 filter is supported by sensitivity calculations and does not suffer significantly from increased confusion noise , a somewhat narrower filter makes sense for other reasons .",
    "the almost 50% bandwidth of the @xmath110 filter will make photometry difficult and may compromise other uses of this filter .",
    "in particular , the strong silicate absorption feature at 9.7  falls in the @xmath110 bandpass .",
    "we therefore recommend a shorter cutoff wavelength , and propose @xmath111 $ ] ( a 37% bandpass ) as our `` preferred '' @xmath10 filter , @xmath107 .",
    "conversely , the optimum @xmath112 $ ] choice is only a 17% bandwidth , and does not produce optimum snr ( see table  [ tab : snr ] ) .",
    "it does however avoid the pah feature at 6.2 , offering the possibility of using filters @xmath9 and @xmath10 as a pah diagnostic .",
    "however the @xmath8 filter also acts as a good continuum filter for this problem , with better snr and the advantage that it shares the same field as the @xmath10 filter .",
    "hence we recommend a broader @xmath9 filter filling the wavelength regime between @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "our preferred @xmath9 filter , @xmath50 , is then @xmath113 $ ] , with a 25% bandpass .",
    "these preferred filters reduce the value of @xmath72 by about 10% , compared to the optimum filters , but we feel that this is outweighed by the gain in general scientific usefulness . in any case , they still offer a significant improvement over the baseline 6.3 and 8.0 filters .",
    "these specifications have now been adopted for the irac instrument .",
