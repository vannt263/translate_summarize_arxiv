    "atomic scale imaging techniques have proven to be useful tools to improve the understanding of atomic processes at surfaces .",
    "prominent examples for studies at metals are the field ion microscopy ( fim ) studies of self diffusion at transition metal surfaces@xcite , the electron microscope studies of step structures and growth on halide , semiconductor , and metal surfaces@xcite , and the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) studies of the epitaxial growth and sputter removal of pt(111).@xcite several observations made in those studies like the reentrant layer - by - layer growth at low temperatures or the temperature variation of the growth form of islands at higher temperatures are not fully understood yet . for other growth phenomena like",
    "the fractal island shape at low temperatures@xcite a satisfying explanation does exist .",
    "understanding the origins for different forms of growth bears technological relevance .",
    "typically it is desirable to have layer - by - layer growth in order to produce high quality films and to achieve this at not too high temperatures.@xcite    how a surface develops during growth is a consequence of the microscopic adatom - surface interaction , especially at binding sites and at transition states of surface diffusion.@xcite if the rates for all relevant diffusion processes are known , the evolution of the surface during growth can be calculated.@xcite because of the computational effort required for a quantum - mechanical description of the microscopic interaction , several quasi - classical methods have been used in the past.@xcite however the reliability of these calculations have always been questionable , especially because neither the influence of the kinetic energy operator for the electrons nor self - consistent rearrangements of the electron density were taken into account properly .",
    "the kinetic energy of the electrons largely determines the nature of the chemical bond by splitting the electronic energies into bonding and antibonding levels , or by influencing the charge distribution at metal surfaces , which is governed by the spill out of density into the vacuum and by the reduction of the charge density corrugation ( smoluchowski smoothing  @xcite ) .",
    "all quantum - mechanical effects which are considered to be relevant for chemisorption are taken into account in density - functional theory ( dft ) to a high level of accuracy when used together with the local - density approximation ( lda ) of the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "@xcite in this paper we report a rather extensive set of dft - lda calculations of adsorption and diffusion of al adatoms on different surfaces of fcc aluminum.@xcite we even include comprehensively the diffusion at steps in our study of al(111 ) .",
    "the role of steps in determining the growth morphology is known since long time.@xcite we chose al because it is a prototype of a simple @xmath2-@xmath3 metal , hoping that the interpretation of any observation would be particular clear and provides insights which are transferable to other systems . besides the flat ( 111 ) , ( 100 ) , and ( 110 ) surfaces , also the two different close - packed steps on al(111 ) are considered .",
    "these steps are called @xmath4 and @xmath5 according to the step s orientation , which is the @xmath6 direction , and the steepest micro - facet at their edges ( see fig .  [",
    "stepscheme]).@xcite the influence of steps is of paramount importance for the description of growth processes.@xcite in particular we like to understand the experimentally established differences between these two sorts of steps on ( 111 ) surfaces of fcc metals .",
    "their slightly different geometry leads to different formation energies,@xcite to different diffusion mechanisms and energy barriers,@xcite and they are found to have different dipole moments.@xcite    using the calculated diffusion barriers and estimated diffusion prefactors we estimated the temperature ranges for different growth modes on al(111 ) . to get a detailed description of the temperature dependence of the growth of the al(111 ) surface one should use our results on surface diffusion as input for a theory@xcite which solves for the rate equations which determine the evolving surface morphology during growth",
    "this still remains to be done .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we give a short description of our _ ab - initio _ method and describe some technical aspects which make it particularly efficient for the calculation of large metallic systems .",
    "section  [ differ ] describes differences in the formation energy of the two sorts of close - packed steps on al(111 ) . in section  [ inddip ]",
    "we discuss the adatom- and step - induced dipole moment on al(111 ) and , connected to that , the work function differences between al(111 ) , al(100 ) , and al(110 ) . in section  [ al111 ] the surface self - diffusion is investigated , first on the flat al(111 ) surface , then approaching a step , and finally at the step . also vacancy diffusion on the flat al(111 ) surface is considered .",
    "we compare the self - diffusion on al(110 ) with that on the stepped al(111 ) surface and we compare diffusion at the two different steps on al(111 ) . in section  [ unif ]",
    "we describe some uniformity in surface self - diffusion on fcc metals , which help us to estimate diffusion prefactors for the self - diffusion on al surfaces . using the calculated diffusion barriers and the estimated prefactors , we summarize in section  [ atom ] our understanding of the temperature dependence of atomic transport processes and of homoepitaxial growth on al(111 ) . in the appendix we also present some results for the self - diffusion on al(100 ) .",
    "the computer code , fhi93cp , used in this study is described in ref .  .",
    "we therefore summarize here only some essentials of the method .",
    "we use density - functional theory and treat the exchange - correlation functional in the local - density approximation.@xcite the kohn - sham equations@xcite are solved by a car - parrinello - like iterative scheme  @xcite using the steepest descent approach  @xcite for the update of the wavefunctions .",
    "we use a fully separable _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "pseudopotential  @xcite for al where the @xmath7-potential is treated as local and @xmath2 and @xmath3 potentials are described by projection operators .",
    "the electronic wavefunctions are expanded in a plane - wave basis set with a kinetic energy cut - off of 8ry .",
    "the brillouin zone is sampled at special * k*-points,@xcite which are specified below for the different systems when these are discussed .    in the following",
    "we describe in more detail the _ damped newton dynamics _ procedure to relax atoms , the fermi surface smoothing technique , and some technical improvements , which allow us to calculate large systems .",
    "we also describe the geometry of the systems investigated and estimate the numerical accuracy of our results .      in our adsorption calculations",
    "we typically allow the al adsorbate and the top two ( 111 ) layers or three ( 110 ) layers to relax until all force components are smaller in magnitude than 0.04ev /  .",
    "it was checked that relaxation of an additional layer leaves the adsorption - energy differences practically unchanged .",
    "the most important effect of the adsorbate - induced substrate relaxation is a reduction of barriers for bridge diffusion by 0.07@xmath80.05ev .",
    "the algorithm to relax the atomic geometry is based on _ damped newton dynamics_. in a finite - difference form the time evolution of any atomic coordinate @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the coordinate at time step @xmath12 and @xmath13 the force on @xmath9 at time step @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 control the damping and the mass of the coordinate .",
    "the choice of those parameters is guided by the goal that this classical dynamics combines a fast movement of the atoms towards the next local minimum of the born - oppenheimer surface and avoids oscillations around it .",
    "we got fast convergence for our al surface systems with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this choice brings the calculations close to the aperiodic limit of a damped oscillator in classical mechanics .",
    "increasing the damping coefficient @xmath14 improves the stability of the atomic relaxation process , reducing it allows for energy barriers to be overcome and so to escape from local minima . in it",
    "s usage of the knowledge of the history of displacements the damped dynamics technique is similar to the conjugate - gradient technique.@xcite    obviously the atomic geometry converges faster when larger displacements per time step are executed .",
    "the magnitude of useful displacements is restricted , however , by the efficiency with which the electronic wavefunctions converge to the electronic ground state of the new atomic coordinates after the displacement .",
    "we found it advantageous to have about eight purely electronic iterations after any atomic displacement .",
    "note that the time - consuming calculation of the atomic forces is not done in those purely electronic iterations .",
    "for all systems studied in this paper about ten atomic relaxations are necessary to converge to the desired accuracy .      in order to stabilize the self - consistent calculations for the electrons and to improve * k*-space integration , we smear out the fermi surface . for this purpose",
    "the kohn - sham eigenstates of energy @xmath18 are occupied according to a fermi distribution @xmath19 with @xmath20ev . using",
    "the fermi distribution implies that the free energy @xmath21 at the electronic temperature @xmath22 is minimized instead of the total energy @xmath23.@xcite here @xmath24 is the entropy of independent electrons,@xcite @xmath25 \\;.\\ ] ] this approach may cause some inaccuracies , as we want to get results belonging to @xmath26 . for the free energy at a given geometry the @xmath27 limit can be easily obtained by evaluation of @xmath28.@xcite this value differs from @xmath29 only by terms which are third and higher order in @xmath22 . for the optimization of the geometry the force @xmath30",
    "should be used which is , however , more complicated to evaluate.@xcite for our choice of @xmath20ev the geometries and the total - energy differences are almost not affected .",
    "this was tested for the adsorption of al on al surfaces by using values of 0.05ev and 0.2ev for @xmath31 and an increased number of * k*-points .",
    "a further approach to stabilize the way self - consistency is achieved is to reduce electron transfer between single - particle states in successive iterations . for this purpose",
    "fictitious eigenvalues after pederson and jackson  @xcite are introduced .",
    "the occupation numbers are calculated directly from the fictitious eigenvalues according to fermi occupation at @xmath22 .",
    "these fictitious eigenvalues follow the as - calculated eigenvalues in a sort of damped dynamics , so that both sets of eigenvalues will become identical when self - consistency is attained .",
    "this indirect approach of damping charge transfer oscillations is easier to implement than the more obvious one of damping the change in occupation numbers directly .",
    "the reason is that the occupation numbers are constrained to be in the range between 0 and 2 , and their sum has to give the total number of electrons .",
    "for the eigenvalues no such constraints exist .",
    "the computer code is optimized for large systems by using the following concepts . because the evaluation of the non - local part of the pseudopotential dominates the computation time for large systems we utilize the translational symmetry for those atoms sitting on ideal lattice sites .",
    "@xcite without introducing any approximation this optimization typically reduces the number of operations by a factor of ten for these atoms .",
    "one often encountered problem with large systems is the @xmath32 dependence of the electrostatic potential . here",
    "@xmath33 is a reciprocal - lattice vector .",
    "this dependence leads to long - wavelength charge - density oscillations , known as _",
    "charge sloshing _ or _",
    "@xmath32 instability_. see for example ref .. we deal with this problem by starting with a rather good initial density constructed by a superposition of contracted atomic charge densities .",
    "the contraction was done following finnis,@xcite where the radial atomic densities are multiplied by a fermi function .",
    "the contraction anticipates most of the intra - atomic charge transfer that occurs upon building a solid from isolated atoms .",
    "the wavefunctions for the first step of the self - consistent iterations are obtained by diagonalizing of the kohn - sham hamiltonian constructed from this approximate density and within a reduced plane - wave basis ( @xmath34ry , depending on time and memory constraints ) .",
    "then , in the first @xmath35 electronic iterations , the charge density @xmath36 is linearly mixed like in `` standard '' self - consistent calculations : @xmath37 we use a mixing coefficient @xmath38 which increases from 10% to 100% within these first eight time steps . by this procedure",
    "the charge sloshing was not initiated for the systems considered in this paper and so did not cause problems during the rest of the calculations . in calculations of larger cells than those reported here we found the linear mixing in * r*-space insufficient .",
    "the charge density sloshing could however be efficiently suppressed by a mixing in * g*-space with a mixing coefficient @xmath39 which was chosen smaller for smaller @xmath40 .    for large systems the required computer memory raises as the square of the number of atoms and",
    "it is largely determined by the number of wavefunction coefficients .",
    "we optimize memory usage in several ways .",
    "a simple steepest - descent update procedure for the wavefunctions is used@xcite so that only the wavefunction coefficients of one iteration need to be stored .",
    "the wavefunction coefficients and most of the other large arrays are stored in single precision ; however , double precision is used for all floating point operations and for storing intermediate results .",
    "our computer code optimizes the data access in computers which use memory of different speed .",
    "the idea is that once data is transferred from slow memory to fast memory , e.g.  from the disk to main memory , this data should be used as often as possible before it is moved back to the disk .",
    "this improvement can be accomplished by reordering loops or by blocking techniques.@xcite the most important case where blocking is used is the orthogonalization of the wavefunctions . instead of orthogonalizing always one wavefunction to those with lower index ( the standard gram - schmidt procedure ) , we orthogonalize a block of , say , 30 wavefunctions to those with lower index and then orthogonalize the wavefunctions within the block . in the case where only part of the wavefunctions at one * k*-point fit into main memory this procedure reduces the disk to memory data transfer by a factor up to 30 .",
    "an example of the efficiency of the code is the calculation of an al slab with 350 atom per unit cell in a supercell as large as 560 atomic volumes , and sampling the brillouin - zone at one special * k*-point .",
    "this leads to 28000 plane waves , to 560 involved electronic states , and an overall memory requirement of 200 mb .",
    "this calculation takes about 25h on an ibm/6000  370 risc workstation with 64 mb main memory , if all atoms sit on ideal lattice positions .",
    "if no atoms are sitting on ideal sites , the time increases by a factor of three .",
    "the time spent waiting for disk access during the calculation is below 30% and could even be reduced noticeably by using the faster hard disks available today .      in order to describe an adatom on a crystal surface we use a slab in a supercell .",
    "the repeating slabs are isolated by @xmath41 of vacuum spacing . for the purpose of studying practically isolated adsorbates ,",
    "the distance between adatoms in neighboring cells is at least three nearest - neighbor spacings .",
    "this results in an interaction energy below 0.03ev for al adatoms .    in order to have more bulk like layers and to avoid artificial adsorbate - adsorbate interaction through the slab , we adsorb the al adatom only on one side .",
    "this approach reduces the slab thickness necessary for the desired degree of accuracy .",
    "@xcite due to the unsymmetrical situation an artificial electric field perpendicular to the slab might arise .",
    "this field is compensated in our calculations as described in ref .",
    ", by introducing a dipole layer in the vacuum region . in the case of an al adsorbate on an al surface",
    "this field is always very small so that even in the uncompensated case the energy differences between different sites are practically unaffected .    for the calculation of adsorption on al(111 )",
    "we use typically normally 5-layers - slabs .",
    "calculations with slabs of and 7 layers show that even with a 4  layer slab adsorption energy _",
    "differences _ are accurately given , which means that they change by less than 0.03ev when thicker slabs are used .",
    "for al(100 ) we find that the desired accuracy of 0.03ev requires a slab thickness of at least 6  layers .",
    "the quantity most sensitive to the slab thickness is the energy barrier for exchange diffusion ; for a 5 layer slab this is by 0.25ev or 66% lower than that of the 6-  and 7-layers thick slabs ( see appendix [ al100 ] ) .",
    "we use a 4@xmath424 surface cell for the calculations of self - diffusion on al(100 ) . for the al(110 ) surface we used 8  layers and a 3@xmath424 surface cell .    in this paper",
    "we treat the two densely packed steps on al(111 ) .",
    "one is called \\{111}-faceted , the other \\{100}-faceted ( see fig .  [ stepscheme ] ) .",
    "the \\{111 } and \\{100 } micro - facets are the steepest ones and therefore give an unambiguous way of naming the steps.@xcite we shall see , however , that the electronic properties of the \\{111}-faceted step are more closely related to the ( 110)-surface .",
    "this similarity was already discovered by nelson and feibelman ,  @xcite who showed that the relaxation of the al(110 ) surface atoms and the atoms close to the @xmath43\\{111 } step is very similar and that the charge densities at the al(110 ) surface and along the \\{110 } plane trough a @xmath43\\{111 } step are nearly identical .",
    "our calculations confirm this and also show the similarity of chemical properties and of self - diffusion on the al(110 ) surface and at the \\{111}-faceted step .    in order to analyze the step properties we use three different approaches . in the first approach a slab in ( 111 ) orientation",
    "is put in an orthorhombic supercell",
    ". then half of the atoms of the top layer are removed , so that the remaining grooved surface has two steps , one being \\{111}- and the other \\{100}-faceted ( see fig .  [ stepscheme ] ; the lower part of the supercell , containing the flat termination of the slab and some more vacuum , is omitted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ stepscheme ] ) .",
    "we choose different sizes of the surface supercell to study the influence of finite size effects .",
    "the width of the cell in @xmath44 $ ] direction is varied from three to four atoms and the width of the terrace in @xmath45 $ ] direction is three to four atomic rows .",
    "all these systems give results which differ only by @xmath46ev .",
    "one reason for this is the rapid screening of al .",
    "the other reason is that quantum size - effects are often unimportant for total - energy differences on stepped al(111 ) which was already noted by nelson and feibelman .",
    "@xcite    the second approach uses a class of systems which are slabs of @xmath47 and of @xmath48 orientation where @xmath49 is an even number .",
    "surfaces with these miller indices are vicinal to the ( 111 ) surface . the @xmath47 surface consist of terraces of ( 111 ) orientation which are @xmath49 atomic rows wide and separated by @xmath50-faceted steps .",
    "the @xmath48 surface has ( 111 ) terraces @xmath51 atomic rows wide , which are separated by \\{100}-faceted steps.@xcite the relationship between the miller indices of the vicinal surfaces and the constituent low index facets can be seen by the vector decompositions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that conventionally common factors are removed from miller indices , so that instead of ( 200 ) [ which is the shortest reciprocal lattice vector in the ( 100 ) direction ] the more familiar ( 100 ) is used and for even @xmath49 the common factor two is removed . thus the miller indices are @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we worked with surfaces belonging to even @xmath49 because they can be accommodated in a monoclinic supercell , whereas for odd @xmath49 a triclinic supercell is required .",
    "the first surface ( i.e.  @xmath56 ) of the @xmath47 family is the ( 220)@xmath57(110 ) surface , for which the ( 111 ) terraces are so narrow that no surface atom has a ( 111)-like coordination . after some test calculations with the ( 221 ) surface ( @xmath58 )",
    ", we concentrated on the ( 332 ) surface ( @xmath59 ) for studying the properties of nearly isolated \\{111}-faceted steps .",
    "the ( 332 ) surface has ( 111 ) terraces which are six atomic rows wide ( see fig .",
    "[ systeme1 ] ) .",
    "we used a 1@xmath424  surface unit cell , which means that 6@xmath424  atoms are exposed at the surface .",
    "this layer is repeated six times to build a slab containing 144  atoms per cell .    for studying the properties of nearly isolated \\{100}-faceted steps we used the ( 433 ) surface out of the @xmath48 family , which contains seven atomic rows of ( 111)-orientation .",
    "with a 1@xmath424 surface unit cell , we get 7@xmath424 atoms exposed on each surface ( see fig .",
    "[ systeme2 ] ) .",
    "again , 6  layers were taken which gives a slab containing 168  atoms per cell .",
    "the adsorption calculations at the steps of the ( 221 ) , ( 332 ) , and ( 433 ) surfaces essentially reproduce the results of the grooved surfaces , which reflects the efficient screening at al surfaces .",
    "this agreement of results obtained for different slabs also provides a good test of the convergence of our calculations with respect to system size and * k*-space sampling .",
    "the main advantage of using the vicinal surface systems is that they allow the investigation of long - range adsorbate - step interactions , which were found for example experimentally by wang and ehrlich;@xcite for a given adsorbate - step distance the number of atoms in the cell is only slightly more than half of that required for the grooved slab geometry",
    ".    for the purpose of calculating the difference in step formation energy of \\{111}- and \\{100}-faceted steps a third kind of system has to be used .",
    "it should contain only one kind of step and it should provide a favorable error cancellation when the energy _",
    "difference _ of the \\{111}- and \\{100}-step systems is determined .",
    "the chosen system consists of a triangular al island on al(111 ) with either \\{111}- or \\{100}-faceted edges , depending on the triangle s orientation .",
    "note that this way the number of atoms and the * k*-space integration is the same for both step orientations . one new uncertainty in determining the step formation energy difference is now introduced however : also the corners of the triangles contribute to the difference .",
    "the contribution of the corners has to be removed by extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit of infinite island size .",
    "the largest triangles studied consisted of 21 atoms in a @xmath60 al(111 ) surface cell . at a slab thickness of 4 layers",
    "this gives 245 atoms per supercell .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constant for a basis set with 8ry cut - off and a * k*-point sampling like that used for the surface calculations is 3.98 ( including zero - point vibrations),@xcite which is 0.7% smaller than the experimental value .",
    "the cohesive energy is 4.15ev , which is 0.75ev higher than the experimental one of 3.40ev .",
    "@xcite these errors in bulk results are within the expectations for a well - converged dft - lda calculation .    the 8ry plane wave cut - off was tested to be sufficient to converge adsorption energy _",
    "differences _ to a numerical accuracy better than 0.02ev ( see also ref . ) . because of the large size of our supercells  they comprise , depending on the problem , 140560 atomic volumes  one special * k*-point  @xcite in the irreducible quarter of the surface brillouin zone , which is always nearly square , is sufficient to give energy differences which are within 0.03ev of those obtained by using two or four times the number of * k*-points .",
    "we also tested the dependence of our results on system size . here the slab thickness as well as the adsorbate - adsorbate and the step - step interactions are relevant .",
    "system size and * k*-space - sampling effects are difficult to separate , because often a change of the size of the system implies different * k*-sampling , and the two effects are about equal in magnitude .",
    "we therefore can not quantify the error introduced by system size effects separately . in order to reduce errors from these two sources",
    "we always quote the mean value of calculations at different * k*-point sampling and system size .",
    "this improves the accuracy because the variations with system size and * k*-space sampling are often oscillatory .",
    "we obtain an overall numerical accuracy of the energy differences given of @xmath61ev , unless a different error margin is stated explicitly .",
    "calculations of the average energy of the two step types can be performed most accurately by investigating the total energy of surfaces with terrace stripes ( see fig .  [ stepscheme ] ) , and comparing these results to those of the flat surface .",
    "the mean step formation energy is determined as 0.24ev per step atom .",
    "table  [ survacform ] shows that this is about half of the energy required to create the al(111 ) surface per surface atom , and that the step formation energy compares to the difference of the surface energies between al(111 ) and the rougher ( 100 ) or ( 110 ) surfaces per atom .",
    "the energy difference of the two step types can be obtained by investigating triangular islands adsorbed on al(111 ) , as these contain only one type of steps ( see fig.[triangle ] ) . comparing islands with 6 , 10 , 15 , and 21 atoms we can extrapolate to the limit where the influence of the corner atoms is negligible .",
    "table  [ triadat ] lists the results for the total - energy differences of two triangles whose orientations differ by  @xmath62 , and hence have different step types .",
    "the data show the rapid convergence of this energy difference with island size .",
    "dividing these energy differences into an island size independent contribution from the three corner atoms and a contribution proportional to the number of true edge atoms a fit to our data ( see table  [ triadat ] ) gives the following results . triangular islands with \\{111}-faceted steps",
    "are more favorable by 0.025  ev per corner and by 0.017  ev per true step atom than islands bounded by \\{100}-faceted steps .",
    "the energy differences are almost the same , whether the island atoms are relaxed or not .",
    "this small effect of relaxation shows that the step formation energy difference is an electronic effect and is not determined by a different step - induced atomic relaxation .",
    "it is interesting that our results can not be estimated from simple embedded atom or effective medium theory@xcite or a bond - cutting model.@xcite the reason is that the two different triangular islands have exactly the same number of bonds .    from the step formation energy one",
    "can directly obtain the equilibrium shape of larger islands by minimizing the island free energy for a given number of atoms in the island .",
    "the graphical solution of this optimization problem is called the wulff construction.@xcite as a result one obtains hexagonally - shaped islands , where the edges alternate between those with a \\{100 } and those with a \\{111 } micro - facet .",
    "the calculations predict that in thermodynamic equilibrium the \\{111}-faceted edge should be longer with a edge length ratio @xmath63 of @xmath64 .",
    "effects of the vibrational or the configurational entropy on the length ratio , which might be important at higher temperatures , are neglected .",
    "it is interesting to note that such hexagonal islands have been observed experimentally by michely and comsa  @xcite in their stm studies of growth and sputter removal of pt(111 ) .",
    "these experiments show that the \\{111 } micro - facet is favored which is what we predict for al(111 ) .",
    "there is a quantitative difference , since for pt(111 ) the measured edge - length ratio is 0.66 , i.e.  @xmath65 .",
    "the similarity to our results is much more than what one would have expected , as , in general , al and pt behave quite differently .",
    "our calculations of induced surface dipole moments and work function differences at al surfaces give unexpected results .",
    "the first interesting observation is that the al(111 ) surface and the al(110 ) surface have about the same work function @xmath66 .",
    "our best converged results are @xmath67ev,@xcite the experiment finds @xmath68ev and @xmath69ev.@xcite    the second result is that steps on al(111 ) do not affect the work function very much .",
    "table  [ tabdip ] lists the induced dipole moment @xmath70 per step atom .",
    "the \\{111}-faceted step induces practically no dipole ( @xmath70=-0.01debye ) , the \\{100}-faceted step has a small dipole moment with the negative end pointing into the vacuum ( @xmath70=0.045debye ) , which means that they increase the work function .",
    "induced dipole moments translate into work function changes @xmath71 according to the helmholtz equation @xmath72 with @xmath70  in debye , @xmath71  in ev , and the area @xmath73 per dipole in bohr@xmath74 .",
    "more noticeable dipole moments are found for 3-fold coordinated al adatoms ( see table  [ tabdip ] ) an example is the dipole moment of 0.24debye for an al adatom on the hcp - site . if there was an adlayer of those al adatoms on al(111 ) of , say , 1/10 monolayer coverage , the work function would increase by 0.13ev .",
    "the reported results on induced dipole moments and work function differences contradict the traditional model of charge redistribution at rough metal surfaces and around protrusions on metal surfaces like steps or adatoms.@xcite this model is based on smoluchowski smoothing .",
    "smoluchowski smoothing is driven by the kinetic energy of the electrons which is lower for a less corrugated charge density .",
    "the smoothing of the charge density lowers the work function for rougher surfaces and causes a induced dipole moment with the positive end towards the vacuum for protrusions on the surface .",
    "the smoothing effect is often discussed in a nearly free electron picture .",
    "an example is the calculation by ishida and liebsch@xcite of the induced dipole moment of steps on jellium .",
    "they find that steps reduce the work function .",
    "extrapolating their results for a step on al(111 ) one gets an induced dipole moment of about  @xmath75debye per step atom equivalent .",
    "the reason why the smoothing model fails in our calculation of atomic al could be that the smoothing effect , which is certainly there , is ( over- ) compensated by the attraction of electrons towards the deeper potential around surface atoms on al(110 ) , step - edge atoms on al(111 ) , or adatoms on al(111 ) .",
    "these atoms are only 7- or 3-fold coordinated as compared to the 9-fold coordinated surface atoms .",
    "therefore they are less well screened , which leads to the deeper potential in their vicinity .",
    "this effects a net transfer of electrons towards those undercoordinated atoms .",
    "a more thorough discussion of the charge rearrangements in different surface geometries and the resulting induced dipole moments will be published elsewhere.@xcite    having a possible explanation why the standard model fails in the case of the simple metal al the remaining puzzle is why it seems to work for the transition metals.@xcite to give an example .",
    "steps on au(111 ) and pt(111 ) show dipole moments between 0.25  debye ( au ) and 0.6  debye ( pt ) per step atom.@xcite a comparison with the jellium calculations in ref .",
    "shows that for those steps the induced dipole moment is larger in magnitude than it would be expected from the smoothing effect of the @xmath2-@xmath3 like electrons only .",
    "the additional negative dipole moment is likely caused by a polarization of the @xmath7-electrons of the step atoms .",
    "this would also explain why au shows a smaller effect than pt .",
    "au has a filled @xmath7-shell , in pt the fermi level cuts the @xmath7-band and therefore it is easier to polarize the @xmath7-states .",
    "we see that for the simple as well as for the transition metals important additions to the smoothing based model for induced surface dipole moments and work function differences have to be made .",
    "this section describes the total - energy surface for an al adsorbate atom on the flat al(111 ) surface and at the \\{100}- and \\{111}-faceted steps .",
    "this discussion is directly relevant for surface diffusion and crystal growth on al(111 ) . we will study how an al adatom moves across the al(111 ) surface , what happens when the adatom comes close to a step , how it attaches to the step coming from the lower side , and how it incorporates into the step by an atomic replacement process coming from the upper side .",
    "the diffusion energy barriers of an isolated al adatoms on the flat al(111 ) surface is very small ( 0.04ev ; see table  [ d111 ] and figs.[diff111s ] and  [ diff100s ] ) .",
    "the hcp site is the stable binding site and the energies of bridge and fcc sites are almost degenerate .",
    "the diffusion path between the hcp sites is the direct connection between adjacent hcp , bridge , and fcc sites .",
    "the only marked maximum of the total - energy surface is at the atop site .",
    "the top site is 0.53ev higher in energy than the hcp site .",
    "interesting about the atop site is the low height of the adatom at the atop site which is close to the height in the 3-fold sites ( see table  [ d111 ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that bond length gets smaller when the coordination is lower ( for the atop site we obtain a bond length of 2.51 which is 6% smaller than for the 3-fold sites ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that the adatom at the atop site introduces a strong substrate relaxation : the substrate atom below the adsorbate is lowered by 0.4 .",
    "a similar substrate relaxation was found in calculations for alkali - metal adsorbates on al(111).@xcite    the height of the diffusion energy barrier of 0.04ev is at the lower limit of an energy barrier one would expect for this close - packed surface from experimental data ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "two features of the total - energy surface are worth discussing further .",
    "we first note that it is unexpected that the hcp site is the equilibrium site for low coverage .",
    "the hcp and fcc sites both provide threefold coordination , but only the fcc site continues the abcabc stacking of the fcc crystal , whereas the hcp site belongs to an abcac stacking .",
    "a simple continuation of the fcc structure would suggest that the fcc site should be occupied .",
    "in fact , the fcc - hcp energy difference is coverage dependent . above 1/4  ml coverage",
    "the fcc site gets more stable . to create a full monolayer of al at the hcp position costs 0.05ev per surface atom",
    "compared to the fcc stacking .",
    "it is interesting that this energy is exactly the mean of the formation energy of the three bulk stacking faults in the @xmath76-direction , which were calculated by hammer et al.@xcite    the reason for the different adsorption energy at the hcp and fcc sites at low coverage is not obvious .",
    "half of the difference exists already before the al(111 ) substrate is relaxed , which shows that there is an electronic contribution .",
    "another hint for an understanding might be that the al adsorbate at the fcc site has a larger induced dipole moment than at the hcp site ( see table  [ tabdip ] ) .",
    "the second interesting feature of al on al(111 ) is that the three - fold coordinated fcc sites and the two - fold coordinated bridge sites have practically the same total energy .",
    "this is not explainable in a coordination number model.@xcite one might guess that the rather favorable energy of the bridge site is a result of the substrate relaxation .",
    "indeed , on the unrelaxed substrate the bridge site is energetically less favorable ( but only by 0.07ev ) than the fcc site .",
    "if the atomic geometry were not relaxed and all atoms are kept at bulk nearest neighbor spacings , then the fcc site were favored by 0.13ev over the bridge site .",
    "still , this is much less than what a coordination number model would predict .",
    "the energy difference between hcp , bridge , and fcc sites is very small .",
    "it is therefore important to check , if the calculations are sufficiently accurate .",
    "we therefore performed several test calculations , varying carefully all parameters which affect the accuracy .",
    "we used coverages from 1/12   to  1/56 ml , increased the number of * k*-points from  1 to  4 and to  9 , we used from  4 to  7 al(111 ) layers , and we increased the plane wave cut - off .",
    "the energy differences of different sites were very stable and the order of fcc and hcp site never reversed at low coverage .",
    "we expect the difference between hcp and fcc site to be accurate to within 0.02ev .",
    "the relative accuracy for the bridge site is slightly worse .",
    "feibelman s recent lda calculations@xcite found the hcp site more stable than the fcc site by 0.03ev , in good agreement with our results .    in order to get an idea of the nucleation probability and the influence of adsorbate - adsorbate interaction on the mobility we calculated the adsorbate - adsorbate interaction between two al adatoms sitting at neighboring hcp - sites .",
    "the energy gain with respect to isolated adatoms is 0.58ev .",
    "we note , however , that only one configuration ( hcp - hcp ) was considered and we did not perform any of our usual checks , so that here an error of @xmath80.2ev might be possible .",
    "table  [ d111 ] and figs .",
    "[ diff111s ] and  [ diff100s ] show that the al adatom is attracted by the step on the lower as well as on the upper terrace and that this is similar for both sorts of steps .",
    "this attraction leads to an energy gain of about 0.1ev at the threefold sites directly at the upper step edge compared to the flat al(111 ) surface .",
    "the long - range attraction towards the step as experienced by atoms on the lower terrace is weaker , but at closer distance the attraction gets as strong that the last two threefold sites before the fivefold at - step site are not local minima any more and an adsorbate there will be funneled towards the step directly .",
    "this attraction and the funneling of al adsorbates by the lower step edge resembles the behavior found recently by wang and ehrlich for ir on ir(111).@xcite also on pt(111 ) indications of a funneling towards steps exist.@xcite finding the same behavior for different metals suggests that the medium - range to long - range attractive interaction is a more general phenomenon .",
    "therefore , an understanding of the nature of the mechanism behind this attraction of adatoms towards steps is desirable .",
    "we approach the analysis of its origin by considering the following thinkable mechanisms and check whether they are indeed attractive or not .",
    "the mechanisms are dipole - dipole interaction , elastic interaction , and interaction of defect induced surface - states .",
    "the analysis shows that the mechanism is not an attractive dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction in the studied cases will be very weak .",
    "even for the largest dipole moments ( those for adatoms at the fcc site and for the \\{100 } step , see table  [ tabdip ] ) the interaction energy would be below 1mev for distances",
    "larger than one nearest - neighbor spacing .",
    "furthermore we note that the interaction would be _",
    "another possible mechanism responsible for the attractive adatom - step interaction could be the elastic interaction of the adsorbate - induced and the step - induced relaxation fields .",
    "this possibility can easily be checked by a calculation of the energy while keeping the substrate atoms at their ideal positions .",
    "our calculations show that the long - range interaction remains unchanged .",
    "thus , elastic effects can be disregarded as the origin of the attractive interaction between the adatom and the step .",
    "the fact that the adatom - step attraction is not of elastic origin and that it is long range excludes the possibility that it can be reproduced with more simple bonding models like coordination number models@xcite or effective medium and embedded atom.@xcite    in consequence there remains only the possibility that the attractive interaction is caused by an interaction of adatom - induced and step - induced surface states or screening charge densities .",
    "this conclusion is supported by recent stm pictures of adsorbate and step induced surface states on cu(111 ) and au(111).@xcite      figure  [ kugeln ] shows five geometries which we consider to be particularly important for diffusion on the al(110 ) surface and at the \\{111}-faceted step on the al(111 ) surface . in the following we will compare the two systems and we will analyze the factors determining the adsorption energies in different bonding geometries .",
    "the results of table  [ d110 ] show that at geometries having the same nearest - neighbor environment , the adsorption energies are very similar on the ( 110 ) surface and at the \\{111}-faceted step .    at the two fivefold sites ( fig .",
    "[ kugeln](a ) ) the adsorption energy is rather large and practically identical in both cases .",
    "the calculated al bulk cohesive energy is only 7% or 0.27ev larger .",
    "the adsorption energy on the threefold equilibrium site on al(111 ) at low coverage ( the hcp site ) is as much as 20% or 0.78ev smaller ( table  [ d111 ] ) .",
    "a coordination number model@xcite would give too small an estimate of the adsorption energy .",
    "the high at - step adsorption energy we understand as follows . at both fivefold sites",
    "the adsorbates sit in a valley which should be filled with additional electronic charge due to smoluchowski - smoothing.@xcite additionally the adsorbates sit very close to the surface . on the ( 110 ) surface",
    "the height at the fivefold site is 1.33 relative to the relaxed clean surface .",
    "this should be compared to the hcp site on al(111 ) , where the height of the adsorbate is 2.09  .",
    "the combination of increased charge density and low height provides a good embedding of the adsorbate.@xcite      the twofold coordinated bridge sites are possible saddle point configurations for surface self - diffusion .",
    "the energies of the comparable bridge sites on al(110 ) and at the \\{111}-faceted step are similar . however , the two different bridges ( see figs.[kugeln](b ) and [ kugeln](c ) ) have a markedly different energy .",
    "this energy difference gives rise to a difference in barrier height of a factor of two ( see table  [ d110 ] ) .",
    "what is the reason for this difference of sites with the same coordination ?",
    "our explanation is the same as for the high adsorption energy at the 5-fold site .",
    "the higher adsorption energy for the long bridge is accompanied by a lower distance to the surface . for the long bridge on the ( 110 ) surface",
    "the adatom height is only 1.58   , whereas the height is 2.16   for the short bridge .",
    "another effect should be that smoluchowski - smoothing fills the valleys with electron density taken from the upper part of the rows on the clean surface .",
    "for the short - bridge position , this would reduce the charge density around the adsorbate , while it would rather increase the embedding charge density for the long bridge position .    having seen the striking similarity of adsorption energies at the ( 110 ) surface and at the \\{111}-faceted step ,",
    "it is no surprise that a system which lies between the two cases , namely the ( 331 ) surface , shows a very similar behavior.@xcite for this system feibelman obtained energy differences between the al adsorption at 2-fold and 5-fold sites which are very close to ours ( see table  [ d110 ] ) .",
    "we expect that the agreement with our results would be within 0.05ev if feibelman would have included the adsorbate - induced relaxation of the substrate .",
    "the agreement of both studies is a most demanding test for the numerical accuracy of both calculations , since feibelman used a rather different technique .",
    "we will now show that the just discussed bridge sites are not the lowest energy transition states for diffusion for the surfaces considered .",
    "diffusion takes place preferably via exchange mechanisms .      investigating the al(110 )",
    "surface we will first show that the exchange mechanism lowers the energy barriers for diffusion , and this holds even in the so called easy direction , i.e.  for diffusion in the channels of this surface .",
    "figure  [ kugeln](d ) sketches the symmetric configurations of the exchange paths .",
    "for both the ( 110 ) surface and for the \\{111}-faceted step , the geometry may be described as two fivefold coordinated al adatoms which are close to a surface vacancy . at the ( 110 ) surface",
    "the two atoms are displaced from the ideal fcc lattice positions by 0.08 towards the vacancy and they are 0.05 closer to the surface than for the `` normal '' fivefold site . at the step",
    "the corresponding displacements are similar .",
    "to get some insight into the nature of bonding of this configuration , we estimate its energy from the adsorption energy of the `` normal '' fivefold site @xmath78 and the calculated vacancy - formation energies , where the al chemical potential , which defines the energy of the removed al atom , is taken as the bulk cohesive energy , i.e.  @xmath79ev . for the vacancy formation energy at the ( 110 ) surface",
    "we then obtain @xmath80ev and at the step the result is @xmath81ev ( see table  [ survacform ] ) .",
    "the energy barriers are then estimated as @xmath82ev and @xmath83ev , in close agreement with the full calculation of the exchange - parallel processes in table  [ d110 ] .",
    "up to now we have only discussed the symmetric configurations of the exchange diffusion path ( see fig.[kugeln](d ) ) without knowing if these are really saddle point configurations .",
    "additional calculations at the step show that they are _ not _ saddle points , but that they correspond to very shallow minima of the total - energy surface .",
    "the saddle points found in these calculations have an energy about  0.04ev higher than the energy of the symmetric configuration .",
    "this energy difference is about 1/10 of the total energy barrier and also very small compared to the numerical accuracy of our calculations .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to discuss the energy for the symmetric exchange configuration when talking about diffusion barriers .",
    "in addition to the discussed mechanisms a third diffusion mechanism for diffusion along the channels was recently proposed by liu et al.@xcite they argue that the configurations of fig.[kugeln](e ) , which are saddle point configurations for the diffusion perpendicular to the channels , are also approximately saddle point configurations for the diffusion parallel to them .",
    "this would imply that the diffusion parallel and the exchange diffusion perpendicular to the rows would have about the same energy barriers .",
    "this idea is interesting , but we get a higher energy barrier for the perpendicular than for the parallel exchange process ( see next paragraph and table  [ d110 ] ) .",
    "thus , for al we can not support the idea @xcite but nevertheless , the proposed process could be the explanation for the near identity of parallel and perpendicular to step diffusion energy barriers on ni , ir , and pt ( see table[tab1 ] ) .",
    "[ diff110cross ]      we now discuss the exchange perpendicular to the channels of al(110 ) and across the @xmath77 step on al(111 ) ( see fig .  [",
    "kugeln](e ) and  [ diff111s ] ) .",
    "again the energies of the saddle point configuration on al(110 ) and at the step are similar ( see table  [ d110 ] ) . the slightly higher energy of the saddle point geometry at the step can be understood in terms of the higher vacancy formation energy at the step ( see table  [ survacform ] ) and of the threefold rather than fourfold coordination of the upper al atom . on al(110 )",
    "the energy of the exchange configuration can be estimated analogously to our discussion in the last section .",
    "the configuration consists of two neighboring fourfold coordinated atoms close to a vacancy .",
    "we want to approximate the energy of the fourfold coordinated atoms by that of another fourfold atom adsorbed at the same height .",
    "there is however some ambiguity in assigning a height to the two adsorbates .",
    "the possibilities are to take the distance of 0.80 to the ( 110 ) surface or that of 2.05 to the \\{111 }  micro - facets , which are built by forming a surface vacancy on al(110 ) ( compare fig.[kugeln](e ) ) .",
    "the height above the \\{111 }  micro - facets is more relevant here than that above the ( 110 ) surface because all substrate nearest neighbors of the two adsorbates belong to these \\{111 }  micro - facets , and we showed already that the nearest neighbor environment determines the bonding to a large extent as a consequence of the good screening of al .",
    "the adsorption energy can therefore be approximated by @xmath84ev of an al adatom on the fourfold site on al(100 ) , which sits 1.69 above the surface ( see table  [ diff100dat ] in the appendix ) .",
    "this gives an estimated energy barrier of @xmath85ev , which equals exactly the energy barrier found in the full calculation .",
    "the success of the simple approach used above to assemble the energy for the exchange configurations from the energies of its constituents exemplifies the role of height and local environment for binding on al surfaces .",
    "this also indicates that the nature of the bonding is very similar for equilibrium adsorption sites and in the examined exchange configurations .",
    "the above studies showed that the interaction of an al adatom with the two kinds of close - packed steps on al(111 ) is at larger distances attractive and practically identical . directly at the step however we identified some important differences in adsorption energies and diffusion barriers and mechanisms .",
    "the results given in table  [ d110 ] show that the adsorption energies at the fivefold coordinated at - step sites is nearly the same , but that there is a small preference ( 0.03ev ) for the @xmath86 step .",
    "this energy difference is very small ; however it might obey a general rule and is therefore interesting to analyze .",
    "according to nelson et al.,@xcite it can be explained by the different step formation energies ( see table  [ survacform ] ) .",
    "adsorbing , e.g. , an al atom at the \\{100}-faceted step creates two \\{111}-faceted `` micro - steps '' ( the situation is reversed at the \\{111 } step ) .",
    "the creation of \\{111}-micro - steps should be favorable , because \\{111}-faceted steps are favorable . according to this model",
    ", the adsorption energies should differ by @xmath87ev .",
    "indeed , the calculated at step adsorption energy difference is very close to this value .",
    "it is tempting to apply the same type of discussion also to the creation of vacancies within the step . to form",
    "a vacancy at the \\{100}-faceted step creates \\{111}-micro - steps and should be favorable .",
    "however , the full calculations show that such analysis is not appropriate ; the vacancy formation energy at the \\{111}-faceted step is energetically favorable ( see in table  [ survacform ] ) .",
    "the results of table  [ d110 ] imply that an al adatom diffusing along the \\{100 }  step will use the normal bridge hopping mechanism and not the exchange mechanism as at the ( 100 ) surface or at the \\{111 }  step .",
    "the main reason for this difference between the two steps is that the adsorption energy at the long - bridge position at the \\{100 }  step is 0.19ev higher .",
    "we understand this as an effect of geometry ( see , e.g. , figs .  [ diff100s ] and [ kugeln](b ) ) . whereas at the long - bridge position of the \\{111 } step the adsorbate is clearly twofold coordinated , the coordination is nearly fourfold at long - bridge position at the \\{100 } step .",
    "the exchange - parallel configurations at the \\{111 } step and at the \\{100 } step have practically the same energies . as a consequence it follows that the diffusion at the lower terrace parallel to the \\{100 } step proceeds via hopping mechanism with an energy barrier about 0.1ev lower than that for the exchange diffusion along the \\{111 } step .",
    "the different diffusion mechanisms should lead to different diffusion prefactors  @xmath88 .",
    "the impact of this difference for the temperature dependence of crystal growth is discussed below in section vi .      for diffusion across the \\{111 } and the \\{100 }  step we obtain in both cases exchange diffusion mechanisms with nearly the same energy barrier heights ( see figs .  [ diff111s ] and  [ diff100s ] ) . for the diffusion across the step in the descending direction the energy barriers are very small ( 0.06ev and 0.08ev ) ; in fact they are only marginally larger than that for the diffusion on the flat al(111 ) surface .",
    "the exchange path at the \\{100}-faceted step is geometrically quite different from that at the \\{111}-faceted step,@xcite as it has no mirror symmetry perpendicular to the step .",
    "we mapped out a two - dimensional total - energy surface , varying the @xmath89- and @xmath90-coordinates of the involved step atom ( atom  2 in fig .",
    "[ diff100s ] ) on a 4@xmath424 grid while relaxing all the other coordinates of the adsorbates and the two upper substrate layers .",
    "in addition we calculated the energy for 4  points on the apparent diffusion path .",
    "we then checked if all the atomic configurations were smoothly connected along the diffusion path or if some atomic coordinates change drastically between adjacent configurations .",
    "the results show that all coordinates vary smoothly , which confirms that the described path is physically relevant .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results for al surface self - diffusion to those for other fcc metals .",
    "the results in table  [ tab1 ] show that the rule of thumb which says that diffusion barriers scale with the cohesive energy is valid .",
    "we also see , that the energy barriers for surface self - diffusion are clearly lowest for the flattest surface , namely ( 111 ) .",
    "all rougher surfaces have diffusion barriers about 5 times higher than the ( 111 ) surface of the same metal .",
    "the diffusion barriers on these rougher surfaces vary by less than a factor of two between different metals .",
    "important for a description of diffusion and its dependence on the local geometry is the fact that in experiment ( and in theory ) the barriers for diffusion in the channels of the ( 110 ) surface and along the \\{111}-faceted steps of the ( 331 ) surface have nearly the same barriers .",
    "the only counter example seems to be ir , but there the barriers for diffusion along the step represent only estimates .",
    "we assume that the diffusion mechanism is the exchange ( see fig.[kugeln](d ) ) in both cases for all metals considered .    in agreement with our results for al ,",
    "the experiments show smaller energy barriers for diffusion along the \\{100 } step than along the \\{111 } step .",
    "one might speculate that this difference of the barriers is connected with the change in diffusion mechanism ; we remind that for al we found that the diffusion along the \\{100 } step proceeds by a hopping mechanism while it proceeds via exchange along the \\{111 } step .",
    "additional insights about the uniformity of diffusion at fcc(111 ) surfaces can be obtained from the diffusion prefactors  @xmath88 . using transition - state theory and semi - empirical calculations ,",
    "@xmath88 was evaluated for a series of metal surfaces.@xcite in all cases the prefactor of an exchange process was larger than that of the normal hopping diffusion ( see also table  [ tab2 ] for al ) .",
    "furthermore , we see in table  [ tab2 ] that the experimentally determined diffusion prefactors are larger in the cases where we expect exchange diffusion .",
    "thus , from the larger diffusion prefactors we conclude that for rh , pt , and ir there is hopping diffusion on the ( 111 ) surface and along the \\{100}-faceted step , and exchange diffusion otherwise ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the above discussed results for diffusion mechanisms , energy barriers , and diffusion prefactors will now be used for an examination of the temperature dependence of growth of al(111 ) .",
    "the mode of growth is controlled by the interplay of the deposition rate and of the temperature dependent processes of diffusion and defect creation and annihilation . with the information of previous sections at hand we can estimate the most important features of this temperature dependence .",
    "an extended study with our results and employing a monte - carlo technique@xcite to evaluate the relevant rate equations , would be certainly superior .",
    "here we assume that the temperature dependence of the diffusion constant is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the energy barrier of the considered diffusion process ( see table  [ d111 ] and [ d110 ] ) .",
    "the pre - exponential factor @xmath93 can be estimated from the adatom attempt frequency @xmath94 and the distance between neighboring adsorption sites , @xmath95 , as @xmath96 .",
    "the factor @xmath97 equals 2 or 4 , depending on the dimensionality of the diffusion process .",
    "@xmath94 can be calculated within transition - state theory from the the total - energy surface.@xcite on the other hand , @xmath93 can also be taken from experimental results for similar diffusion processes ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "writing @xmath98 and defining the temperature @xmath99 at which a certain diffusion mechanism becomes active as that at which the adatom will jump at least once per second ( @xmath100s ) , it follows that @xmath101    in table  [ tab2 ] we give our choice for @xmath88 , based on theoretical results for the al surface diffusion as well as on experimental data for rh , pt , and ir .",
    "this choice is clearly not unambigous ; one has to consider , however , that an error of a factor of  10 in @xmath93 changes the temperature @xmath99 by less than 10% .",
    "the results of the above procedure to determine onset temperatures for diffusion are given in table  [ edtd ] .",
    "for temperatures below 320  k the desorption of adatoms from steps is practically irrelevant ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ diff100s ] and table  [ edtd ] ) .",
    "thus adatoms captured at a step edge will stay and the island will grow .",
    "the processes important for growth at temperatures below 320  k are therefore the capture of al adatoms at the steps and the diffusion along the steps and their relative rates .",
    "the following approximate analysis of temperature ranges for different growth modes assumes a deposition rate of @xmath102  ml / s .",
    "the further assumption is that for this deposition rate a jump rate of @xmath103s is large enough in order for a deposited al adatom to diffuse to a more stable site before other deposited adatoms meet the first one and form a nucleus .",
    "if the deposition rate is higher than @xmath102  ml / s then the necessary jump rate to get the same growth mode has to be increased proportionally .",
    "this implies that the temperature has to be increased logarithmically ( see eq .  [ it d ] ) .",
    "the analysis implies :    * our calculations show that an al dimer on al(111 ) is bound by 0.58  ev and is therefore stable at temperatures below @xmath104k .",
    "if the mobility of the dimer is smaller than that of the single adatom it will serve as a nucleus for the growth of the next layer . in that case",
    "three - dimensional growth would occur whenever two adatoms meet on the upper terrace at a substantial rate.@xcite * at temperatures below 25  k adatoms on the upper terrace are hindered by the step - edge energy barrier to move down ( see table  [ edtd ] ) .",
    "we note that island edges are frayed at this temperature ( see next item ) , which may reduce the barrier , and adatoms gain energy by adsorption and by approaching the upper step edge , which might lead to some transient mobility.@xcite furthermore we note that on small and/or narrow islands the attempts to overcome the step - edge barrier are more frequent which increases the chance for a success .",
    "we are therefore not convinced that the three - dimensional growth mode really exists for clean al(111 ) . * for 25  k  @xmath105  155  k the energy barriers of diffusion parallel to both close - packed steps will prevent diffusion parallel to the steps .",
    "the diffusion at flat parts of the surface is , however , still easy and therefore the attraction of gas - like adatoms towards the steps edges is still active . as a consequence we expect that islands will be formed in a way which may be described as a `` hit - and - stick '' mechanism .",
    "thus , the edges can not equilibrate and fractal - shaped islands with a layer - by - layer growth mode should result . * for @xmath106  k the step edges will be straight , as diffusion along the step is possible , and therefore the islands will be triangular or hexagonal . according to a simple model by michely _",
    "et al._@xcite the different diffusion properties for atoms at the two kinds of step edges might become important for determination of the detailed growth form of the island .",
    "the model says that the growth perpendicular to the step with the lower adatom mobility will advance fastest .",
    "if the growth speed of one step is faster by more than a factor of two than that of the other step the faster one will eventually disappear . as a consequence",
    "the growth shape of the island would be triangular . for al(111 )",
    "our results imply that at low temperature the diffusion parallel to the \\{111 } step is hindered more than that parallel to the \\{100 } step because of the higher diffusion barrier . however , because the diffusion mechanism is different at these two steps the prefactor for the diffusion parallel to the \\{100 } step is smaller ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . as a consequence , at higher temperature the diffusion coefficient for",
    "the movement parallel to the \\{100 } step will be smaller than that for the movement parallel to the \\{111 } step.@xcite + the additional assumption in ref .",
    "is that the growth speed of steps with larger diffusion barriers along the step is higher .",
    "this is caused by the less efficient atom transport along the step to corners of the growing island .",
    "atoms moving to the corners contribute to the growth of the adjacent step .",
    "+ we therefore predict that the adatom islands during growth at lower temperature have shorter \\{111 } edges and at higher temperature they have shorter \\{100 } edges . at a medium temperature the growth shape of islands is hexagonal . * there are two mechanisms for vacancy formation we considered on the al(111 ) surface .",
    "the direct creation of vacancies on flat al(111 ) is expected to happen with a rate above 1/s per surface - atom at temperatures above 730k ( see table  [ edtd ] ) . in the presence of al - adatoms",
    "the vacancy creation should already take place at 490k , due to the then reduced barrier ( see table  [ edtd ] ) .",
    "adatoms can be provided either from deposition or by desorption from the step .",
    "the relatively high energy barriers to create adatoms lets us assume , that the adatom assisted vacancy formation will not be important before the formation of vacancies on the flat al(111 ) sets in at 730k .",
    "+ the second possibility to create vacancies is at steps . at a \\{100}-faceted step",
    "they will be created with rates of @xmath107s and step - atom at a temperature of 320k . at a \\{111}-faceted step",
    "this temperature is 380k ( see table  [ edtd ] ) .",
    "these vacancies could migrate into the terrace and become `` normal '' surface vacancies .",
    "the barrier for vacancy migration is 0.56ev on the flat al(111 ) , so it becomes active at 240k ( see tables  [ tab1 ] and [ edtd ] ) .",
    "the onset temperature for vacancy generation from steps therefore should be 320k . vacancy generation and diffusion into the terrace was also observed in stm experiments on pt(111),@xcite which again shows the similarity of atomic processes on pt(111 ) and al(111 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented results of accurate electronic structure and total - energy calculations which reveal several phenomena directly relevant to the description of self - diffusion at al surfaces and to crystal growth .",
    "the three low index surfaces of al are quite different with regard to surface self diffusion .",
    "the diffusion barriers for al adatoms on al(111 ) [ @xmath92=0.04ev ] are much lower than on al(100 ) and al(110 ) [ @xmath92=0.330.62ev ] . for al(100 ) and al(110 ) atomic exchange mechanisms have lower barriers for surface self diffusion than ordinary hopping .",
    "exchange diffusion was found even in the direction parallel to the atomic rows on al(110 ) .",
    "the diffusion of surface vacancies was studied for the al(111 ) surface ( @xmath92=0.56ev ) .",
    "our calculations predict that al adatoms on al(111 ) are attracted towards the edge of close packed steps by a long - range force which most likely originates from a interaction of adatom and step induced surface states .",
    "adatoms close to the lower step edge are funneled towards the step . the diffusion of an al adatom from the upper to the lower terrace proceeds via an exchange of the on - terrace adatom with an in - step - edge substrate atom .",
    "the barrier for this exchange process is rather low which leads to layer - by - layer growth down to very low temperatures .",
    "corresponding results have been observed in field - ion microscopy studies of w and ir adatoms on ir(111 ) by wang and ehrlich.@xcite    on al(111 ) the energy barrier for diffusion of an al at - step adatom parallel to the step is much bigger than that perpendicular to the step in the descending direction . in the temperature range where this energy barrier becomes relevant ,",
    "we expect fractal growth .",
    "the mechanism for diffusion along the two kinds of steps is different .",
    "along the \\{111}-faceted steps we find an atomic replacement mechanism similar to that for diffusion parallel to the rows on al(110 ) , along the \\{100}-faceted steps the hopping mechanism has the lowest energy barrier .",
    "the differences in energy barrier and diffusion prefactor for diffusion along the two kinds of steps can lead to temperature dependent growth forms of islands .",
    "surface systems where similar growth phenomena were observed experimentally are pt on pt(111)@xcite and au on ru(0001).@xcite    a comparison of our results for self diffusion on al surfaces and of other theoretical and experimental results on transition metals indicate that atomic exchange processes in surface self diffusion are more common than assumed previously .",
    "we predict that \\{111}-faceted steps on al(111 ) are energetically favorable compared to the \\{100}-faceted steps .",
    "a similar energy difference was found for pt(111 ) in experiment.@xcite    additionally to the energetics at al surfaces we have discussed the surface dipole moments induced by adatoms and steps on the al(111 ) surface and , related to that , the work function differences of the low index surfaces of al .",
    "our results indicate that the commonly used model based on smoluchowski smoothing alone@xcite has to be modified .",
    "we add here our results for the adsorption and diffusion of al on al(100 ) .",
    "our study repeats that of feibelman on the same system.@xcite the main result of feibelman s paper , which is the favorable energy barrier for an exchange diffusion mechanism , has been questioned recently.@xcite we calculated the adsorption energies at the three sites which are important for the discussion of surface diffusion ( see fig .",
    "[ diff100view ] ) .",
    "our results confirm that the exchange diffusion mechanism has a lower barrier than the bridge diffusion mechanism .",
    "the agreement in adsorption energy differences of our results with those of feibelman is again as excellent as in the other examples in this paper .",
    "however , this agreement with feibelman s results is obtained only , if we use the same slab thickness as he did , i.e. , 5-layers ( see table  [ diff100dat ] ) .",
    "the agreement would be even better , if we had not relaxed all atoms but only those which feibelman had relaxed .",
    "however , while the numerical accuracy of both calculations agree , it is most interesting to note that our calculations with 6 and 7 layer slabs show a significant change of the energy of the exchange configuration .",
    "this change increases the barrier for diffusion by nearly a factor of three ( see table  [ diff100dat ] ) .",
    "a similar sensitivity of calculated energies with slab thickness was not found for any other system and we do not have an explanation for it .",
    "the energy of the exchange configuration also proved to be especially sensitive to changes in the value of the lattice constant and the * k*-point sampling .",

    "cohesive and adsorption energies are given with respect to the energy of an isolated al atom calculated in a large cell with the same 8ry cut - off .",
    "adding the spin - polarization energy of 0.15ev gives the cohesive energy as 4.15ev which is 0.75ev higher than the experimental value .",
