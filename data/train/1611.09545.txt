    "one might subsequently think that maximizing the number of @xmath17-colourings of a graph in @xmath37 should depend on the value of @xmath1 .",

    "it is not hard to see that conjecture  [ tomesdongconj ] implies theorem  [ tomesdisconn ] because the chromatic polynomial of a graph is equal to the product of chromatic polynomials of its connected components .",
    "however , the problem of maximizing the number of colourings appears more difficult when graphs are connected , since the answer to this problem depends on the value of @xmath1 ( the structure of extremal graphs seem to be different for @xmath42 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "as tomescu points out @xcite , the difficulty may lie in the lack of a characterization of _ @xmath1-critical _ graphs ( those minimal with respect to @xmath1-chromaticity ) when @xmath9 .    if @xmath60 then @xmath61 as one can first colour the clique of order @xmath1 and then recursively colour the remaining vertices ( which have only one coloured neighbour ) . on the other hand , one can see that if @xmath61 then @xmath62 because the multiplicity of the root @xmath51 of the chromatic polynomial of a graph @xmath0 is equal to the number of blocks of @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
