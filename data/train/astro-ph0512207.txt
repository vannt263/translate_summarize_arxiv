    "extrasolar planet detections and analysis of the non - detections further our knowledge of the planet formation process and contribute to an empirical determination of the typical planetary system .",
    "these empirical constraints will eventually decide the ubiquity or rarity of planetary bodies in the universe .",
    "a variety of techniques exist to detect extrasolar planets @xcite , and there are currently 168 extrasolar planet discoveries .    most of the extrasolar planets have been discovered using the radial velocity technique .",
    "radial velocity detections indicate that @xmath7 of fgk main - sequence stars in the solar neighborhood have a `` hot '' jupiter - mass planet ( hj ) orbiting within 0.1 au @xcite . at this small separation from the central star ,",
    "the high temperatures and low disk column densities prevent in situ formation of hj planets @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms exist to exchange angular momentum between the protoplanet and natal disk , enabling the protoplanet to migrate from a more likely formation separation ( several au ) to within 0.1 au @xcite . due to tidal circularization",
    ", hj have nearly circular orbits with an observed median eccentricity , @xmath8 , whereas planets with larger separations have a median eccentricity of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the detection statistics and planet properties , the extrasolar planet detections indicate several physical relationships between the stellar host properties and the frequency of extrasolar planets .",
    "the most striking of these is that the probability for hosting an extrasolar planet increases rapidly with stellar metal abundance , consistent with @xmath10 @xcite . the frequency of planets may also depend on the stellar mass . @xcite and @xcite point out that there exists a deficit of @xmath11 planets orbiting m dwarf stars .",
    "however , the increasing number of short - period neptune - mass planets being discovered around m dwarfs suggests that the overall frequency of planets ( of all masses ) orbiting m dwarfs may be similar to fgk dwarfs , but the typical planet mass is less , thereby escaping detection given the detection limitations of the current radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "additionally , none of the m dwarfs harboring planets are metal rich @xcite .",
    "a coherent theory of planet formation and survival requires not only reproducing the physical properties of the planets , but reproducing any trends in the physical properties on the host environment . despite the knowledge and constraints on extrasolar planets that radial velocity surveys provide , radial velocity surveys have their limitations . the high resolution spectroscopic requirements of the radial velocity technique limit its use to the solar neighborhood and orbital periods equivalent to the lifetime of the survey .",
    "a full consensus of the planetary formation process requires relying on additional techniques to detect extrasolar planets in a larger variety of conditions prevalent in the universe .",
    "for instance , microlensing surveys are sensitive to extrasolar planets orbiting stars in the galactic disk and bulge with distances of many kpc away ( @xcite ) .",
    "two objects consistent with jupiter - mass companions have been detected via the microlensing technique @xcite .",
    "additional information is obtained from studying the microlensing events that did not result in extrasolar planet detections .",
    "microlensing surveys limit the fraction of m dwarfs in the galactic bulge with jupiter - mass companions orbiting between 1.5 au to 4 au to @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "although limited to the solar neighborhood , attempts to directly image extrasolar planets are sensitive to planets with semimajor axis beyond 20 au .",
    "the light from the parent star limits detecting planets interior to the seeing disk . adaptive optics observations of young ( @xmath13 myr ) stars provide the best opportunity to directly image extrasolar planets since the young planets are still relatively bright while undergoing a rapid , cooling contraction .",
    "although the interpretation relies on theoretical modeling of these complex planetary objects , three sources in nearby star forming regions have been detected whose broad - band colors and spectra are consistent with those expected from 1 - 42 jupiter - mass objects @xcite .",
    "the contrast ratios necessary for extrasolar planet detection are difficult to reach , and results for detecting higher mass brown dwarfs are more complete .",
    "an analysis of the cornell high - order adaptive optics survey ( chaos ) derives a brown dwarf companion upper limit of 10% orbiting between 25 and 100 au of the parent star @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath14 of g , k , and m stars have brown dwarf companions orbiting between 75 and 300 au , but this estimate may not account for the full range of orbital inclination and eccentricities possible @xcite . at greater separations ,",
    "@xmath15 1000 au , brown dwarf companions to f - m0 main - sequence stars appear to be as common as stellar companions @xcite .",
    "after the radial velocity technique , the transit technique has had the most success in detecting extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "the transit technique can detect @xmath0 transits in any stellar environment where @xmath161% photometry is possible .",
    "thus , it provides the possibility of detecting extrasolar planets in the full range of stellar conditions present in the galaxy : the solar neighborhood , the thin and thick disk , open clusters , the halo , the bulge , and globular clusters are all potential targets for transit surveys .",
    "a major advantage of the transit technique is the current large - format mosaic ccd imagers which provide multiplexed photometric measurements with sufficient accuracy across the entire field of view .",
    "the first extrasolar planet detections via the transit technique began with the candidate list provided by the ogle collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , confirmation of the transiting extrasolar planet candidates requires radial velocity observations . due to the well known equation - of - state competition between electron degeneracy and ionic coulomb pressure , the radius of an object becomes insensitive to mass across the entire range from below @xmath11 to the hydrogen - burning limit @xcite .",
    "thus , objects revealing a @xmath0 companion via transits may actually have a brown - dwarf mass companion when followed up with radial velocities .",
    "this degeneracy is best illustrated by the planet - sized brown dwarf companion to ogle - tr-122 @xcite .",
    "the first radial - velocity confirmations of planets discovered by transits @xcite provided a first glimpse at a population of massive , very close - in planets with @xmath17 3 days and @xmath18 ( `` very hot jupiters '' - vhj ) that had not been seen by radial velocity surveys .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , after accounting for the strong sensitivity of the transit surveys to the period of the planets , the transit detections were likely consistent with the results from the radial velocity surveys , implying that vhjs were intrinsically very rare .",
    "subsequently , in a metallicity - biased radial velocity survey , @xcite discovered a vhj with @xmath19 day around the bright star hd189733 that also has observable transits .    despite the dependence of transit detections on radial velocity confirmation",
    ", radial velocity detections alone only result in a lower limit on the planetary mass , and thus do not give a complete picture of planet formation .",
    "the mass , radius information directly constrains the theoretical models , whereas either parameter alone does little to further constrain the important physical processes that shape the planet properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the mass - radius relation for extrasolar planets can constrain the size of the rocky core present ( e.g. , @xcite ) . also , the planet transiting across the face of its parent star provides the exciting potential to probe the planetary atmospheric absorption lines against the stellar spectral features @xcite . or",
    ", in the opposite case , emission from the planetary atmosphere can be detected when the planet orbits behind the parent star @xcite .    despite these exciting results , the transit technique is significantly hindered by the restricted geometrical alignment necessary for a transit to occur . as a result",
    ", a transit survey necessarily contains at least an order of magnitude more non - detections than detections .",
    "in addition , null results themselves can provide important constraints .",
    "for example , the null result in the globular cluster 47 tucanae adds important empirical constraints to the trend of increasing probability of having a planetary companion with increasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the sensitivity of a given transit survey , i.e.  the expected rate of detections and non - detections , takes on increased importance .",
    "several studies have taken steps toward sophisticated monte carlo calculations to quantify detection probabilities in a transit survey @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these studies do not fully characterize the sources of error and systematics present in their analysis , and therefore the reliability of their conclusions is unknown .",
    "furthermore , essentially all of the previous studies have either ( 1 ) not accurately determined the number of dwarf main - sequence stars in their sample , or ( 2 ) made simplifying assumptions which may lead to misestimated detection probabilities , or ( 3 ) contained serious conceptual errors in the procedure with which they have determined detection probabilities , or ( 4 ) some combination of the above .    as a specific and important example",
    ", most studies do not apply identical selection criteria when searching for transits amongst the observed light curves and when recovering injected transits as part of determining the survey sensitivity .",
    "removal of false - positive transit candidates arising from systematic errors in the light curve has typically involved subjective visual inspections , and these subjective criteria have not been applied to the recovery of injected transits when determining the survey sensitivity .",
    "this is statistically incorrect , and can in principle lead to overestimating the survey sensitivity . even if identical selection criteria are applied to the original transit search and in determining the survey sensitivity , some surveys do not apply conservative enough selections to fully eliminate false - positive transit detections .    in this paper , we address these shortcomings of previous studies in our analysis of a 19-night photometric search for transiting extrasolar planets in the open cluster ngc 1245 .",
    "an automated transit search algorithm with quantitative selection criteria finds six transit candidates ; none are bona fide planetary transits .",
    "we describe our monte carlo calculation to robustly determine the sensitivity of our survey , and use this to derive upper limits on the fraction of cluster members with close - in , jupiter - radii , @xmath0 , companions .",
    "leading up to the process of calculating the upper limit , we develop several new analysis techniques .",
    "first , we develop a differential photometry method that automatically selects comparison stars to reduce the systematic errors that can mimic a transit signal .",
    "in addition , we formulate quantitative transit selection criteria , which completely eliminate false positives due to systematic light - curve variability without human intervention .",
    "we characterize the survey detection probability via monte carlo injection and boxcar recovery of transits .",
    "distributing the monte carlo calculation to multiple processors enables rapid calculation of the transit detection probability for a large number of stars .",
    "the techniques developed here enable combining results from transit surveys in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "this work is part of the survey for transiting extrasolar planets in stellar systems ( stepss ) .",
    "the project concentrates on stellar clusters since they provide a large sample of stars of homogeneous metallicity , age , and distance @xcite .",
    "overall , the project s goal is to assess the frequency of close - in extrasolar planets around main - sequence stars in several open clusters . by concentrating on main - sequence stars in open clusters of known ( and varied ) age , metallicity , and stellar density",
    ", we will gain insight into how these various properties affect planet formation , migration , and survival .",
    "the survey characteristics and the photometric procedure are given in ",
    "we explain the automated algorithm to calculate the differential light curves and describe the light curve noise properties in  [ lc ] . in  [ trandetect ] we describe our implementation of the box - fitting least squares ( bls ) method @xcite for transit detection . in  [ sec : selcrit ] we present a thorough discussion of the quantitative selection criteria for transit detection , followed by a discussion of the objects with sources of astrophysical variability that meet the selection criteria in  [ trncands ] .",
    "we outline the monte carlo calculation for determining the detection probability of the survey in  [ effcalc ] .",
    "we present upper limits for a variety of companion radii and orbital periods in  [ results ] .",
    "a discussion of the random and systematic errors present in the technique is given in ",
    "[ uplimiterrsec ] .",
    "we compare the final results of this study to our expected detection rate before the survey began and discuss the observations necessary to reach sensitivities similar to radial velocity detection rates in  [ discussion ] .",
    "finally ,  [ conclusion ] briefly summarizes this work .",
    "we observed ngc 1245 for 19 nights between 24 oct . and 11 nov .",
    "of 2001 using the mdm 8k mosaic imager on the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope .",
    "the mdm 8k imager consists of a 4x2 array of thinned , 2048x4096 , site st002a ccds @xcite .",
    "this instrumental setup yields a 26@xmath20x26@xmath20 field of view and 0.36@xmath21 per pixel resolution in 2x2 pixel binning mode .",
    "table  [ obsdat24 ] has an entry for each night of observations that shows the number of exposures obtained in the cousins @xmath22-band filter , median full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) seeing in arcseconds , and a brief comment on the observing conditions . in total ,",
    "936 images produced usable photometry with a typical exposure time of 300 s.      we use the iraf ccdproc task for all ccd processing . the read noise measured in zero - second images taken consecutively",
    "is consistent with read noise measured in zero - second images spread through the entire observing run .",
    "thus , the stability of the zero - second image over the course of the 19 nights allows median combining 95 images to determine a master , zero - second calibration image . for master flat fields ,",
    "we median combine 66 twilight sky flats taken throughout the observing run .",
    "we quantify the errors in the master flat field by examining the night - to - night variability between individual flat fields .",
    "the small - scale , pixel - to - pixel variations in the master flat fields are @xmath23 , and the large - scale , illumination - pattern variations reach the 3% level",
    ". the large illumination - pattern error results from a sensitivity in the illumination pattern to telescope focus .",
    "however , such large - scale variations do not affect differential photometry with proper reference - star selection ( as described in  [ lc ] ) .    to obtain raw instrumental photometric measurements",
    ", we employ an automated reduction pipeline that uses the dophot psf fitting package @xcite .",
    "comparable quality light curves resulted from photometry via the daophot / allframe , psf - fitting photometry packages @xcite in the background limited regime .",
    "dophot performs slightly better in terms of rms scatter in the differential light curve in the source - noise limited regime .",
    "the photometric pipeline originated from a need to produce real - time photometry of microlensing events in order to search for anomalies indicating the presence of an extrasolar planet around the lens @xcite .",
    "this study uses a variant of the original pipeline developed at the ohio state university and currently in use by the microlensing follow up network @xcite .    in brief",
    ", the pipeline takes as input a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) `` template '' image . a first pass through dophot",
    "identifies the brightest , non - saturated stars on all the images .",
    "using these bright - star lists , an automated routine ( j.  menzies , private communication ) determines the geometric transformation between the template image and all the other other images .",
    "a second , deeper pass with dophot on the template image identifies all the stars on the template image for photometric measurement .",
    "the photometric procedure consists of transforming the deep - pass star list from the template image to each frame .",
    "these transformed positions do not vary during the photometric solution .",
    "next , an automated routine ( j.  menzies , private communication ) determines an approximate value for the fwhm and sky as required by dophot .",
    "finally , dophot iteratively determines a best - fit , 7-parameter analytic psf and uses this best - fit psf to determine whether an object is consistent with a single star , double star , galaxy , or artifact in addition to the photometric measurement of the object .",
    "in its simplest form , differential photometry involves the use of a single comparison star in order to remove the time variable atmospheric extinction signal from the raw photometric measurements @xcite .",
    "the process of selecting comparison stars typically consists of identifying an ensemble of bright , isolated stars that demonstrate long term stability over the course of the observations @xcite .",
    "this procedure is sufficient for studying many variable astrophysical sources where several percent accuracy is typically adequate .",
    "however , after applying this procedure on a subset of the data , systematic residuals remained in the data that were similar enough in shape , time scale , and depth to the expected signal from a transiting companion to result in large number of highly - significant false positive detections .",
    "removing @xmath160.01 mag systematic errors resembling a transit signal requires a time consuming and iterative procedure for selecting the comparison ensemble . additionally , a comparison ensemble that successfully eliminates systematic errors in the light curve for a particular star fails to eliminate the systematic errors in the light curve of a different star .",
    "testing indicates each star has a small number of stars or even a single star to employ as the comparison in order to reduce the level of systematics in the light curve .",
    "on the other hand , poisson errors in the comparison ensemble improve as the size of the comparison ensemble increases .",
    "additionally , the volume of photometric data necessitates an automated procedure for deciding on the `` best '' possible comparison ensemble . given its sensitivity to both systematic and gaussian noise and its efficient computation , we choose to minimize the standard deviation around the mean light curve level as the figure of merit in determining the `` best '' comparison ensemble .",
    "we balance improving systematic and poisson errors in the light curve using the standard deviation as the figure of merit by the following procedure .",
    "the first step in determining the light curve for a star is to generate a large set of trial light curves using single comparison stars .",
    "we do not limit the potential comparison stars to the brightest or nearby stars , but calculate a light curve using all stars on the image as a potential comparison star .",
    "all comparison stars have measured photometry on at least 80% of the total number of images .",
    "a sorted list of the standard deviation around the mean light - curve level identifies the stars with the best potential for inclusion in the comparison ensemble .",
    "calculation of the standard deviation of a light curve involves 3 iterations eliminating 3-standard - deviation outliers between iterations .",
    "however , the eliminated measurements not included in calculation of the standard deviation remain in the final light curve .    beginning with the comparison star that resulted in the smallest standard deviation",
    "we continue to add in comparison stars with increasingly larger standard deviations . at each epoch , we median combine the results from all the comparison stars making up the ensemble after removing the average magnitude difference between target and comparison .",
    "we progressively increase the number of stars in the comparison ensemble to a maximum of 30 , calculating the standard deviation of the light curve between each increase in the size of the comparison ensemble .",
    "the final light curve is determined using the comparison ensemble size that minimizes the standard deviation .",
    "less than 1% of the stars result in the maximum of 30 comparison stars .",
    "the median number of comparison stars is 4 , with a modal value of 1 .",
    "the distribution of comparison stars has a standard deviation around the median of 4 .",
    "the fact that the standard deviations of the majority of stars is minimized using a single comparison star emphasizes the importance of considering all stars as possible comparisons in order to minimize systematic errors and achieve the highest possible accuracy .",
    "independent of this study , @xcite developed a generalized algorithm for eliminating systematic errors in light curves that shares several basic properties with the method we have just presented .",
    "they agree with the conclusion that optimal selection of comparison stars can eliminate systematics in the light curve .",
    "they also use the standard deviation of the light curve as their figure of merit ( see their equation 2 ) .",
    "however , their more general implementation allows for the comparison star to have a real - valued , linear correlation coefficient ( @xmath24 in their equation 1 ) in the differential photometry , whereas the implementation outlined here forces binary values , 0 or 1 , for the linear correlation coefficient .",
    "they solve for the real - valued , linear correlation coefficients by minimization of the standard deviation via matrix algebra , whereas the method given here relies on brute force minimization of the standard deviation .",
    "a thorough comparison of the performance between these methods has not been done .",
    "however , we emphasize that our algorithm found that the modal number of stars in the comparison ensemble is a single star .",
    "their algorithm restricts the comparison ensemble to a subset of the available stars .",
    "the restricted comparison ensemble may not capture the systematics present in a light curve .",
    "however , their real - valued , linear correlation coefficients may provide the degree of freedom lacking in the algorithm of this study necessary to cancel the systematics .",
    "both algorithms possess an important caveat .",
    "the figure of merit can not distinguish between improvements in the poisson error or systematic error and therefore does not guarantee optimal elimination of the systematic deviations .",
    "although our procedure for optimally choosing comparison stars succeeds in dramatically reducing systematics in the light curves , we find that some additional systematic effects nevertheless remain .",
    "we introduce several additional corrections to the light curves to attempt to further reduce these effects .    in good seeing , brighter stars",
    "display saturation effects .",
    "whereas , in the worst seeing , some stars display light - curve deviations that correlate with the seeing . to correct for these effects",
    ", we fit a two - piece , third - order polynomial to the correlation of magnitude versus seeing .",
    "the median seeing separates the two pieces of the fit .",
    "we first fit the good - seeing piece with the values of the polynomial coefficients unconstrained .",
    "we then fit the poor - seeing piece , but constrain the constant term such that the fit is continuous at the median seeing .",
    "however , we do not constrain the first or higher order derivatives to be continuous . in performing this fit , we excise measurements from the light curve that would lead to a seeing - correlation correction larger than the standard deviation of the light curve .",
    "we use this two - piece fit to correct the measurements .",
    "measurements nearby bad columns on the detector also display systematic errors that are not removed by the differential photometry algorithm .",
    "thus , measurements when the stellar center is within 6 pixels of a bad column on the detector are eliminated from the light curve .",
    "the final correction of the data consists of discarding measurements that deviate by more than 0.5 mag from the average light curve level .",
    "this prevents detection of companions with radii @xmath25 around the lowest mass stars of the sample .",
    "figure  [ magrms ] shows the logarithm of the standard deviation of the light curves as a function of the apparent @xmath22-band magnitude .",
    "calculation of the standard deviation includes one iteration with 3-standard - deviation clipping . to maintain consistent s /",
    "n at fixed apparent magnitude , the transformation between instrumental magnitude to apparent @xmath22-band magnitude only includes a zero - point value , since including a color term in the transformation results in stars of varying spectral shape and thus varying s / n in the instrumental @xmath22 band having the same apparent @xmath22-band magnitude .",
    "each individual ccd in the 8k mosaic has its own zero point , and the transformation is accurate to 0.05 mag .",
    "one ccd has significantly better noise properties than the others as evidenced by the second sequence of points with improved standard deviation at fixed magnitude .",
    "the instrument contains a previously unidentified problem with images taken in the binning mode .",
    "the data was taken with 2x2 native pixels of the ccd array binned to one pixel on readout . during readout ,",
    "the control system apparently did not record all counts in each of the four native pixels .",
    "however , the single ccd with improved noise properties does not suffer from this problem whereas all the other ccds do .",
    "subsequent observations with large positional shifts allow photometric measurements of the same set of stars on the affected detectors and unaffected detector . performing these observations in the unbinned and",
    "binning modes confirms that on the affected detectors , 50% of the signal went unrecorded by the data system .",
    "this effectively reduces the quantum efficiency by half during the binned mode of operation for seven of the eight detectors .",
    "the two solid lines outlining the locus of points in figure  [ magrms ] provide further evidence for the reduction in quantum efficiency .",
    "these lines represent the expected noise due to a a source - noise limited error , a term that scales as a background - noise limited error , and 0.0015 mag noise floor .",
    "we determine the lower line by varying the area of the seeing disk and the flat noise level until the noise model visually matches the locus of points for the detector with the lower noise properties .",
    "then , the upper line results from assuming half the quantum efficiency of the lower noise model while keeping the noise floor the same .",
    "the excellent agreement between the higher noise model and the noise properties of the remaining detectors strongly supports the conclusion that half of the native pixels are not recorded during readout .",
    "this readout error could introduce significant errors in the limit of excellent seeing .",
    "however , only 4% of the photometric measurements have fwhm@xmath42.5 binned pixels .",
    "thus , even in the binning mode , we maintain sufficient sampling of the psf to avoid issues resulting from the readout error .",
    "the different noise properties between detectors does not complicate the analysis .",
    "the transit detection method involves @xmath26 merit criteria ( see  [ sec : selcrit ] ) that naturally handle data with varying noise properties .",
    "other than reducing the overall effectiveness of the survey , the different noise properties between the detectors does not adversely affect the results in any way .",
    "in addition to the empirically determined noise properties , dophot returns error estimates that on average result in reduced @xmath27 for a flat light - curve model .",
    "the average reduced @xmath26 for all the detector agree within @xmath28 . scaling errors",
    "to enforce reduced @xmath29 for each detector independently has a negligible impact on the results , thus we choose not to do so .",
    "the upper and lower dash lines in figure  [ magrms ] show the transit depth assuming the star is a cluster member for 1.5 and 1.0 @xmath0 companions , respectively . in figure  [ magrms ] ,",
    "3671 stars have light curves with a standard deviation less than the signal of a transiting @xmath0 companion .",
    "in the previous section , we describe a procedure for generating light curves that reduces systematic errors that lead to false - positive transit detections .",
    "however , systematics nevertheless remain that result in highly significant false - positive transit detections .",
    "this section describes the algorithm for detecting transits and methods for eliminating false positives based on the detected transit properties .",
    "there are two types of false - positives we wish to eliminate .",
    "the first is false - positive transit detections that result from systematic errors imprinted during the signal recording and measurement process . the second type of false - positive results from true astrophysical variability that does not mimic a transit signal .",
    "for example , sinusoidal variability can result in highly significant detections in transit search algorithms .",
    "we specifically design the selection criteria to trigger on transit photometric variability that affects a minority of the measurements and that are systematically faint .",
    "however , the selection criteria do not eliminate false - positive transit signals due to true astrophysical variability that mimic the extrasolar planet transit signal we seek ( grazing eclipsing binaries , diluted eclipsing binaries , etc . ) .    for detecting transits",
    "we employ the box - fitting least squares ( bls ) method of @xcite . given a trial period , phase of transit , and transit length , the bls method provides an analytic solution for the transit depth .",
    "we show in the appendix the equivalence of the bls method to a @xmath26 minimization . instead of using the signal residue ( equation 5 in * ? ? ? * ) or signal detection efficiency ( equation 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for quantifying the significance of the detection , we use the resulting improvement in @xmath26 of the solution relative to a constant flux fit , as outlined in the appendix .",
    "this section begins with a discussion of the parameters affecting the bls transit detection algorithm .",
    "we set the bls algorithm parameters by balancing the needs of detecting transits accurately and of completing the search efficiently .",
    "the next step involves developing a set of selection criteria that automatically and robustly determines whether the best - fit transit parameters result from bona fide astrophysical variability that resembles a transit signal .",
    "a set of automated selection criteria that only pass bona fide variability is a critical component of analyzing the null - result transit survey and has been ignored in previous analyses .    due to the systematic errors present in the light curve , statistical significance of a transit with a gaussian noise basis",
    "is not applicable .",
    "in addition , the statistical significance is difficult to calculate given the large number of trial phases , periods , and inclinations searched for transits .",
    "given these limitations , we empirically determine the selection criteria on the actual light curves .",
    "although it is impossible to assign a formal false alarm probability to our selection criteria , the exact values for the selection criteria are not important as long as the cuts eliminate the false positives while still maintaining the ability to detect @xmath0 objects , and identical criteria are employed in the monte carlo detection probability calculation .",
    "the bls algorithm has two parameters that determine the resolution of the transit search .",
    "the first parameter determines the resolution of the trial orbital periods .",
    "the bls algorithm ( as implemented by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) employs a period resolution with even frequency intervals , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the previous trial orbital period , @xmath32 is the subsequent ( longer ) trial orbital period , and @xmath33 determines the frequency spacing between trial orbital periods . during implementation of the bls algorithm , we adopt an even logarithmic period resolution by fractionally increasing the period , @xmath34 .",
    "the original implementation by @xcite for the orbital - period spacing is a more appropriate procedure , since even frequency intervals maintain constant orbital phase shifts of a measurement between subsequent trial orbital periods .",
    "the even logarithmic period resolution we employ results in coarser orbital phase shifts between subsequent trial orbital periods for the shortest periods and increasingly finer orbital phase shifts toward longer trial orbital periods .",
    "either period - sampling procedure remains valid with sufficient resolution .",
    "we adopt @xmath35 , which , given the observational baseline of 19 days , provides @xmath410% orbital phase shifts for orbital periods as short as 0.5 day .",
    "the second parameter of the bls algorithm determines the resolution in orbital phase by binning the phase - folded light curve .",
    "binning of the data in orbital phase drastically improves the numerical efficiency , but not without loss in determining the correct transit properties .",
    "@xcite give a thorough examination of how the sensitivity in recovering transits varies with orbital - phase binning resolution .",
    "to search for transit candidates in the light curves we adopt @xmath36 orbital - phase bins .",
    "we verify with tests that the above parameters accurately recover boxcar signals in the light curves .",
    "after injection of boxcar signals in the light curves , we calculate the @xmath26 of the solution returned by the bls method with the @xmath26 of the injected model .",
    "tests show that the bls method with the above parameters return a @xmath26 within 30% , and typically much better , of the injected model s @xmath26 .",
    "we apply the bls method following the description in the previous section to search for transit candidates in all 6787 stars with light curves . a visual inspection of a light curve folded at the best - fit transit period",
    "can generally be used to discriminate between bona fide astrophysical variability and a false positive arising from systematic errors .",
    "however , a proper statistical assessment of the sensitivity of a transit search requires that the exact same set of selection criteria that are applied to cull false positives are also applied when assessing the detection probability via , e.g. , monte carlo injection and recovery of artificial signals . due to",
    "the large number of artificial signals that must be injected to calculate the detection probability properly , using selection criteria based on visual inspection of light curves is practically very difficult or impossible .",
    "therefore , quantitative , automated detection criteria that mimic the visual criteria must be used .",
    "we employ four selection criteria that eliminate all false detections while still maintaining the ability to detect @xmath0 companions .",
    "these four selection criteria constitute cuts on ( 1 ) the improvement in @xmath37 of a transit model over a constant flux model , ( 2 ) the ratio between the @xmath38 of the best - fit transit model and the @xmath39 of the best - fit anti - transit model , ( 3 ) the fraction of @xmath38 from a single night , and ( 4 ) the transit period .",
    "the first of the selection criteria is a cut on @xmath38 , the improvement in @xmath26 between a constant flux model and a transit model .",
    "the @xmath38 is similar to the signal residue , sr , of @xcite ; we derive @xmath40 and its relation to sr in the appendix .",
    "we prefer @xmath40 over sr as the former allows a direct comparison of the transit detection significance between light curves with different noise properties .",
    "given the correlated systematics in the data , we can not rely on analytical formulations with a gaussian statistics basis for the statistical significance of a particular @xmath40 value .",
    "we empirically determine a cut on @xmath38 in combination with the other selection criteria to fully eliminate false detections .",
    "for a transit detection we require @xmath41 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , this selection criterion corresponds to a s / n@xmath110 transit detection .",
    "figure  [ selcrit ] shows the @xmath38 of the best fit transit for all light curves along the x - axis .",
    "the vertical line designates the selection criteria on this parameter .",
    "even with such a strict threshold , there are still a large number of false positives that pass the @xmath42 cut .",
    "systematic variations in the light curves that are characterized by small reductions in the apparent flux of star that are coherent over the typical time scales of planetary transits can give rise to false - positive transit detections .",
    "however , under the reasonable expectation that systematics do not have a strong tendency to produce dimming versus brightening of the apparent flux of the stars , one would expect systematics to also result in a false - positive ` anti - transit ' ( brightening ) detections .",
    "furthermore , most intrinsic variables can be approximately characterized by sinusoids , which will also result in significant transit and anti - transit detections . on the other hand , a light curve with a true transit signal and",
    "insignificant systematics should produce only a strong transit detection , and not a strong anti - transit detection .",
    "thus , the ratio of the significance of the best - fit transit signal relative to that of the best - fit anti - transit signal provides a rough estimate of the degree to which a detection has the expected properties of a bona fide transit , rather than the properties of systematics or sinusoidal variability . in other words ,",
    "a highly significant transit signal should have a negligible anti - transit signal , and therefore we require the best - fit transit to have a greater significance than the best - fit anti - transit .",

    "we do this by comparing an estimate of the stellar radius derived from the cmd to an independent estimate of a lower limit on the stellar radius derived from the properties of the light curve . in both cases we find that the stellar radii derived from the cmd are well below the lower limit on the stellar radius based on the light curve .    to derive a lower limit on the stellar radius from the light curve , we build on the work by @xcite .",

    "misidentification of the correct orbital period results from gaps in the observing window function . replacing @xmath68 in the above equation with @xmath82 , where @xmath76 is the orbital period returned by the bls algorithm , provides the maximum plausible deviation of this quantity and increases the robustness of the lower limit .",
    "in addition , the stellar mass determination based on the cmd potentially has contamination from a binary companion .",

    "the lower limit for star 70718 is @xmath91 , whereas the cmd yields @xmath92 .",

    "the transiting companions to 20513 and 70718 are also unlikely to be planets if the host stars are field dwarfs .",
    "@xcite provide a diagnostic to verify the planetary nature of a transit when only the light curve is available .",

    "20513 and 70718 are unlikely to host planetary companions with @xmath98 if they are main - sequence stars .",
    "we note that our final _ a posteriori _ criterion with which we reject cluster transit candidates , namely the consistency between the radius of the parent star as estimated from the cmd and the radius as estimated from the light curve , is a conceptually different kind of selection criterion than those that we applied to all the light curves to arrive at our six transit candidates .",
    "the original four selection criteria were designed to detect bona fide astrophysical variability that resembles the signals from transiting planets , but does not necessarily arise from a transiting planetary companion . in principle , we could have included the radius consistency cut as an additional selection criterion applied to all light curves . the motivation to do this would be that imposing this additional criterion might automatically remove some systematic false positives and so allow us to improve our efficiency by making the other selection criteria less stringent .",
    "we have found using limited tests that this is not the case .",
    "we therefore chose to leave the radius check as an _ a posteriori _ cut on the transit candidates .",
    "nevertheless , observing a cluster does provide an advantage over observing field stars , as the additional constraint on the stellar radius from the cluster cmd provides a more reliable confirmation of the planetary nature than the light curve alone @xcite , and furthermore allows a more accurate assessment of the detection probability .",
    "it is important to emphasize that all of the injected transits with which we compute the detection probability (   [ effcalc ] ) automatically pass the radius consistency criterion .",
    "a fraction of these will be recovered at periods that differ enough from the input period that by using the recovered period they will no longer satisfy the radius constraint .",

    "computing power limitations discourage calculating detection probabilities over the entire cluster sample .",

    "the error in the mean detection probability scales as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the intrinsic standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath181 values and @xmath188 is the size of the subsample .",
    "we empirically test this error estimate by calculating the upper limit with subsamples of increasing size .",
    "the small points in figure  [ uplimiterr ] show the upper limit on the fraction of stars with planets as a function of the subsample size .",
    "the upper limit calculation assumes an even logarithmic distribution of semimajor axis for companions with @xmath189 day for 1.5 and 1.0 @xmath0 radius companions , top and bottom panels , respectively .",
    "neighboring columns of upper limits differ by a factor of 2 in the subsample size .",
    "we randomly draw stars from the full sample without replacement , making each upper limit at fixed sample size independent of the others .",
    "the dashed line represents the upper limit based on the full cluster sample .    the distribution of upper limits around the actual value possesses a significant tail toward higher values .",
    "this tail results from the significant number of stars with @xmath190 . at fixed sample size",
    ", the large square point represents the mean upper limit .",
    "using subsamples sizes of @xmath191 tends to systematically overestimates the true upper limit .",
    "the open star symbol represents the @xmath192 standard deviation of the distribution at fixed sample size .",
    "the solid line shows the error estimate from equation  [ uplimerreq ] . despite the non - gaussian nature of the underlying distribution ,",
    "the error estimate in the upper limit roughly corresponds with its empirical determination especially toward increasing @xmath188 where the systematic effects become negligible . from figure  [ uplimiterr ] , we conclude that adopting @xmath193 provides adequate control of the random and systematic errors in calculating an upper limit , without becoming numerically prohibitive .",
    "this verifies the procedure for estimating the upper limit for a variety of companion radii in  [ uplimradsec ] .      up to this point",
    ", we have mainly addressed sources of error directly associated with determining @xmath110 .",
    "however , the upper limit error budget contains an additional source of error from uncertainties in determining @xmath144 .",
    "this additional source of error directly relates to the accuracy in determining the number of single main - sequence stars in the survey .",
    "we characterize this error as follows . at fixed orbital period , @xmath194 .",
    "given that @xmath144 is nearly independent of the other terms , the previous average is separable , such that @xmath195 .",
    "this separation changes the derived upper limit by a negligible 0.3% relative error .",
    "the separation allows us to rewrite equation  [ uplimave ] as @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the effective number of cluster members in the sample after taking into account background contamination .",
    "thus , @xmath198 carries equal weight with @xmath199 in the upper - limit error budget .    the ability to determine @xmath198 accurately provides an advantage for transit surveys toward a rich stellar cluster rather than toward a random galactic field .",
    "even though methods based on the cluster cmd statistically determine cluster membership , they concentrate on a narrow main - sequence region to search for planets where the cluster counts significantly outweigh the background contamination counts . by concentrating on the main sequence of a cluster ,",
    "this survey has only @xmath200 contamination by background stars .",
    "in contrast , random galaxy fields contain @xmath201 contamination by subgiant and giant stars for v@xmath411 surveys @xcite .",
    "overall , @xmath198 has an 8% error , which propagates to a relative error of 8% in the upper limit .",
    "the error in @xmath198 comes from subtracting the star counts observed within a 12.7@xmath20 radius of the cluster center by the control field star counts outside this radius .",
    "the error is larger than the poisson error of @xmath202 since the control field star count is scaled to match the larger cluster field area .",
    "the final source of error we address results from stellar blends due to physical binaries or chance , line - of - sight associations .",
    "the additional light from an unresolved blend dilutes a transit signal from one component of the blend .",
    "thus , we overestimate the ability to detect a transit around blends . however , a compensatory effect arises since the extra light from a blend results in an overestimate in the stellar mass and radius , which in turn results in modeling a shallower transit . modeling such details is not possible without knowing the binary nature for each object , but we can estimate the number of stars affected by assuming binary star statistics as measured in the field . due to low stellar crowding",
    ", we estimate chance blends have a negligible effect in comparison to physically associated binaries @xcite . finding charts in figure  [ find ] demonstrate the stellar crowding conditions of the survey .    the latest coravel radial velocity survey dedicated to f7-k field dwarfs @xcite and the visual binary and common proper motion pairs survey of @xcite provide the basis for the binary star estimates . overall",
    "they find a binary frequency of 56% for systems with @xmath203 .",
    "however , due to the strong dependence of luminosity on the stellar mass only systems with mass ratio , @xmath204 , significantly contribute light to dilute the transit signal . for lower mass ratios",
    "the lower mass component contributes @xmath205 of the total system flux . when taking binaries across the entire range of orbital periods the mass - ratio distribution peaks near @xmath206 and slowly drops toward higher q @xcite . from figure 10 in @xcite",
    ", only @xmath207 of their binary systems have @xmath204 .",
    "thus , if the binary statistics for the cluster matches the field dwarfs , transit dilution occurs for @xmath208 of the stellar sample .",
    "the radial velocity survey for binaries in the pleiades and praesepe clusters reveals consistency with the frequency of binaries in the field surveys @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the data from this survey can also answer whether the binary statistics of the cluster matches the field dwarfs .",
    "however , the statistical methods and selection criteria described in this study do not optimally detect interacting and eclipsing binaries . additionally , in order to reach planetary companion sensitivities , we remove light - curve deviations beyond 0.5 mag as discrepant , which removes the deep eclipses .",
    "the errors involved with determining the number of cluster members dominates the error budget in determining the upper limit . however , as discussed in  [ effcalc ] , this is only true if one quantifies and corrects for the systematic overestimate in detection probability due to a reduction in the transit signal from the procedures of generating and correcting the light curve .",
    "for instance , at the median stellar brightness for this survey , the detection probability is overestimated by @xmath1515% for orbital periods @xmath154.0 day and @xmath151.0 day for 1.5 and 1.0 @xmath0 companions , respectively , without correction . since we characterize this systematic effect , the error in determining the number of cluster members dominates the error budget .",
    "additionally , the potential for a large contamination of binaries diluting the transit signal necessitates an asymmetrical error bar .",
    "we roughly quantify the error estimate resulting from binary contamination from the field dwarf binary statistics . from the arguments in the previous section , we adopt 11% as a @xmath192 systematic fractional error due to binary star contamination .",
    "overall , combining this systematic error with the 7% fractional error in determining the cluster membership , upper limits derived from the full stellar sample contain a @xmath209 fractional error .",
    "along with this work , several other transit surveys have quantified their detection probability from actual observations in an attempt to constrain the fraction of stars with planets or quantify the consistency with the solar neighborhood radial velocity planet discoveries @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison of upper limits from this work with these other transit surveys can not be made . until this study",
    ", none of the previous studies have quantified the random or systematic errors present in their techniques in sufficient detail to warrant a comparison .",
    "additionally , previous studies do not have quantifiable selection criteria that completely eliminate false - positive transit detections due to systematic errors in the light curve , a necessary component of an automated monte carlo calculation .      in the meantime",
    ", we can discuss why the initial estimate of finding two planets assuming 1% of stars have @xmath0 companions evenly distributed logarithmically between 0.03 to 0.3 au @xcite compares to the results from this study , which indicate that we expected to detect 0.1 planets .",
    "the initial estimates for the detection rate are based on the theoretical framework of @xcite .",
    "given a photometric noise model , observational window , and s / n of the transit selection criteria , the theoretical framework yields an estimate of the survey detection probability .",
    "this theoretical detection probability coupled with a luminosity function for the cluster determines the expected number of detections . as we show next , the initial estimates did not account for the light curve noise floor or detector saturation , and contain optimistic estimates for the sky background and luminosity function .",
    "in addition , the initial estimates could not have accounted for the 50% reduction in signal for the majority of the light curves due to the detector error discussed in  [ sec : noise ] . finally ,",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite and demonstrated explicitly here , the detection probability is very sensitive to the precise error properties near the critical threshold of detection , which for this survey is just reached for @xmath210 companions .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ effthy ] compare the detection probability of the monte carlo calculation of this study to the initial theoretical estimate .",
    "the small points replicate the monte carlo results from the top panels of figure  [ powerlawfig ] , while the dashed line shows the detection probability based on the initial theoretical expectations .",
    "the initial theoretical expectations clearly overestimate the detection probability .",
    "the bright end continues to rise due to ignoring the effects of detector saturation and the photometric noise floor .",
    "the faint end does not cutoff due to an underestimated sky brightness",
    ". the initial estimate of the sky brightness , 19.5 mag arcsec@xmath211 , compares optimistically to the range of sky brightnesses encountered during the actual observations .",
    "the sky varied between 17.5 and 19.0 mag arcsec@xmath211 over the course of the observations .",
    "the full lunar phase took place near the middle of the observation , and the moon came within 40@xmath212 of the cluster when nearly full .    the initial estimate for the cluster luminosity function simply selected cluster members via tracing by eye lines that bracket the main sequence in the cmd .",
    "this crude technique led to an estimated 3200 cluster members down to @xmath21320 . a careful accounting of the field star contamination results in only @xmath1870 cluster members in the survey . the luminosity function overestimate and",
    "the expected sensitivity to transits around the bright and faint cluster members leads to a factor of 4 - 5 overestimate in the number of cluster members in the survey .",
    "additionally , the factor of 4 - 5 overestimate of the initial detection probability when compared to binned average detection probability for the monte carlo results ( open stars in figure  [ effthy ] ) , easily accounts for the factor of 20 difference in the overall number of expected detections ( for @xmath214 ) .",
    "clearly , accurate and realistic transit detection statistics requires more detailed analysis than these early estimates and more careful theoretical work has already been done @xcite . in the case of an open cluster , delineating cluster membership by tracing the main sequence in the cmd overestimates the number of cluster members .",
    "a careful subtraction of the field contamination is necessary in order to extract an accurate cluster - member count .    a photometric noise model that accurately reflects the quality of observations is the next step in correctly calculating a theoretical detection probability . from figure  [ magrms ] , we estimate the actual photometric noise present in the data .",
    "this includes the proper sky measurement and systematic floor in the photometric precision . with a noise model similar to the lower solid line in figure  [ magrms ]",
    ", we recalculate the theoretical detection probability .",
    "the dot dash line in figure  [ effthy ] shows the resulting detection probability still overestimates the monte carlo results .",
    "however , it does agree with the faint - end cutoff of the monte carlo calculation .",
    "we impose the bright - end cutoff due to saturation effects at the same magnitude as the observed increase in light curve rms as shown in figure  [ magrms ] .    for these results",
    "we include an additional effect not taken into account by @xcite .",
    "we multiply the transit s / n selection criteria , equation 5 of @xcite , by @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the typical number of transits detected throughout the observing run .",
    "the @xmath217 floor in this factor corresponds to the requirement of observing the transit twice multiplied by the observing efficiency . for simplicity , we take @xmath218 , where @xmath219 , the length of the observing run in days , and the factor of 0.2 accounts for the actual observational coverage encountered during the run .    given that the theoretical calculation still overestimates the monte carlo results , to increase the realism of the theoretical detection probability , we include a linear limb - darkening law , which effectively weakens the transit depth .",
    "we solve for the factor @xmath220 , equation 6 of @xcite , assuming a linear limb - darkening parameter , @xmath221 , for all stars .",
    "the inclusion of limb darkening significantly impacts the theoretical detection probability as the solid line in figure  [ effthy ] demonstrates .",
    "although the theoretical detection probability still overestimates the upper envelope of results from the monte carlo calculation , the level of agreement , after including an accurate photometric noise model and limb darkening , shows significant improvement over the initial estimates .    despite the improved agreement ,",
    "the monte carlo detection probability calculation shows significant scatter at fixed magnitude .",
    "the theoretical probability treats all stars at fixed magnitude as having the same noise properties . with the theoretical detection probability we can address whether the scatter in detection probability at fixed magnitudes results from the observed scatter in noise properties at fixed magnitude as shown in figure  [ magrms ] .",
    "thus , we calculate a theoretical detection probability for each star individually using the measured rms in the light curve for each star to determine the theoretical transit s / n selection criteria using equation 5 of @xcite .",
    "the small points in the bottom panels of figure  [ effthy ] show the resulting theoretical detection probability .",
    "some of the scatter in detection probability results from the scatter in noise properties as a function of magnitude .",
    "the heavy star points represent the average monte carlo detection probability in 0.25 magnitude bins . in the case of the 1.5 @xmath0 companions ,",
    "the signal is large in comparison to the photometric noise .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ effthy ] demonstrate the theoretical detection probability overestimates the monte carlo detection probability by only 20% .",
    "however , the closer the transit signal approaches the systematic and rms noise , the theoretical detection probability strongly overestimates the actual detection probability . in the case of 1.0 @xmath0 companions ( right panels of figure  [ effthy ] ) ,",
    "the theoretical calculation overestimates the monte carlo results by 80% .",
    "thus , we urge caution when relying on a theoretical detection probability when the survey is near the critical threshold for transit detection .",
    "such is the case for 1.0 @xmath0 companions in this survey .      even though the theoretical calculation overestimates the absolute detection probability by a factor of @xmath42 , tests on a small sample of stars with the monte carlo calculation",
    "reveal it provides a much higher relative accuracy .",
    "thus , the computationally efficient theoretical calculation allows us to examine the relative change in the detection probability for a given change in survey parameters .",
    "for planning future surveys it is essential to decide between increasing the number of stars by observing another cluster or improving the detection probability by increasing the length of observations on a single cluster . as shown in  [ results ] , the upper limit scales linearly with the sample size , thus keeping everything else constant , increasing the sample size by a factor of 2 improves the upper limit by a factor of 2 .    using the theoretical detection probability framework , we can quantify the improvement in sensitivity for a survey twice as long .",
    "we assume a survey twice as long consists of an observing window identical to the current survey for the first half and repeats the observing window of the current survey for the latter half .",
    "the upper limit improves only by a factor of 1.3 for a logarithmic distribution of vhj planets .",
    "however , the upper limits for hjs with 3.0 to 9.0 day orbital periods decrease by a factor of 2.6 .",
    "thus , not only is it more efficient to observe this cluster twice as long , but the analysis of @xcite reveals a 5 - 10 times larger hj population than the the vhj population .",
    "this strongly suggests transit surveys with a single observing site require month long runs for maximum efficiency in detecting hj companions .",
    "figure  [ effthy ] reveals little improvement in the detection probability occurs for increasing the photometric precision , at least for 1.5 @xmath0 companions .",
    "to first order , the photometric precision determines the faint - end cutoff in the detection probability .",
    "thus , a lower sky background or improved photometric precision predominately effects the number of stars in the survey rather than the detection probability .",
    "however , improving the photometric precision does lead to increasing the sensitivity for smaller radius companions . in the case of 1.0 @xmath0 companions , the rms in the light curve",
    "typically is @xmath161.8 times lower than the transit signal .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the theoretical detection probability breaks down for such low precision . in the case of 1.5 @xmath0 companions ,",
    "the rms in the light curve typically is @xmath164 times lower than the transit signal .",
    "thus , for the 1.0 @xmath0 results to reach the same sensitivity as the 1.5 @xmath0 results , improvement in the light curve rms is necessary until the transit s / n is above a critical threshold when the detection probability is weakly dependent on @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "according to a recent review of radial velocity detected planets , @xmath222 of solar neighborhood stars have hj companions @xcite .",
    "this survey of ngc 1245 reached an upper limit of 52% of the stars having 1.5 @xmath0 hj companions . as mentioned previously , a survey lasting twice as long can reduce this upper limit to 21% .",
    "reaching similar sensitivity as the radial velocity results requires observing additional clusters in order to increase the number of stars in the sample .",
    "this survey has @xmath223 cluster members and @xmath224 of them have nonzero detection probability for 1.5 @xmath0 vhj companions .",
    "hence a total sample size of @xmath6 dwarf stars observed for a month will be needed to help constrain the fraction of stars with planets to a 2% level ( comparable to radial velocity results ) .",
    "assuming that the observed hj frequency of @xmath23 remains valid for a variety of stellar environments , we expect to detect one planet every 5000 dwarf stars observed for a month .",
    "results for 1.0 @xmath0 companions without substantial improvement in the photometric precision likely will require a small factor larger sample size .",
    "in this study we complete the analysis of a 19-night search for transiting extrasolar planets orbiting members of the open cluster ngc 1245 .",
    "an automated transit search algorithm with quantitative selection criteria finds six transit candidates ; none are bona fide planetary transits .",
    "thus , this work also details the procedure for analyzing the null - result transit search in order to determine an upper limit on the fraction of stars in the cluster harboring close - in @xmath0 companions .",
    "in addition , we outline a new differential photometry technique that reduces the level of systematic errors in the light curve .",

    ", we elucidate the meaning of some of the detection statistics introduced in @xcite .",
    "finally , we quantify the accuracy of the boxcar approximation to transit light curves and discuss appropriate detection thresholds in the presence of correlated systematic errors as well as pure noise .",
    "we begin by considering a series of flux measurements , @xmath225 , taken at times @xmath226 with errors @xmath227 .",

    "a light curve of a star with transiting planet can be written as @xmath232 $ ] , where @xmath233 is the unobscured flux of the star , and @xmath234 is the fractional drop in flux due to the transiting planet as a function of time .",
    "this generally depends on five parameters , namely the planet period @xmath68 , the phase of the planet orbit @xmath235 , the time it takes for the planet to cross one stellar radius , the ratio of the planet radius to stellar radius @xmath236 , and the limb - darkening parameter of the star .",
    "we can write the fractional flux difference as @xmath237 , where we have defined @xmath238 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath239 and @xmath240 , and therefore @xmath241",
    ".    for @xmath242 , and no limb darkening , the light curve @xmath243 phased to the period @xmath68 reduces to a simple boxcar , @xmath244 when the planet is occulting the star and @xmath245 otherwise , with five parameters : the unocculted flux @xmath246 , the transit period @xmath68 , phase @xmath235 , duration @xmath247 , and depth @xmath159 .",
    "this simple form allows an analytical solution for two of these parameters . for finite @xmath236 and limb darkening , the expression for @xmath234 increases in complexity , but , as we show later , a simple boxcar still approximates the variability .    the likelihood @xmath248 that the model @xmath243 with parameters @xmath249 describes the data @xmath250 is simply , @xmath251 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eqn : loglike}\\ ] ] a likelihood maximization , or @xmath37 minimization , determines the best - fit parameters . phasing the measurements @xmath250 to a given period ,",
    "we can split @xmath37 into two terms , including the points in transit and points out of transit , @xmath252 where the first sum over index @xmath109 is over the points in transit , and the second over index @xmath253 is over the points out of transit .",
    "the quantity @xmath254 of bls corresponds to our @xmath255 , where the sum over index @xmath158 is over all points . since @xmath256 is a constant , this verifies the equivalence of their algorithm to a simple @xmath37-minimization . expanding the quadratic terms in yields ,",
    "@xmath257 given the identity @xmath258 , it is clear that the first term is simply the @xmath37 of a constant flux fit to the data , which we denote @xmath259 , and the second term is zero .",
    "therefore , the last four terms are the improvement in @xmath37 between the constant - flux fit , and a boxcar transit fit , for a given @xmath260 .    minimizing the expression for @xmath37 with respect to @xmath246 , we find @xmath261 .",
    "inserting this into the expression for @xmath37 , and then minimizing with respect to @xmath159 , we find the parameters @xmath159 , @xmath246 that simultaneously minimize @xmath37 for a given @xmath260 , @xmath262 @xmath263    we note that the solution for @xmath159 does not impose a particular sign",
    ". the best - fit boxcar model may be of a transit or anti - transit nature .",
    "the improvement in @xmath37 at these best - fit parameters is        the above expression gives the @xmath37 improvement for a particular set of @xmath260 .",
    "the global solution that maximizes the @xmath26 improvement , @xmath265 , requires a grid search over the entire @xmath266 parameter space feasible for transit detection . in the bls algorithm ,",
    "evaluation of @xmath267 for a given @xmath260 amounts to simple error - weighted binning , making the process extremely efficient and fast .",
    "due to the large number of light curves with injected transits that must be searched in order to determine the detection probability accurately ( see  [ effcalc ] ) , this study requires the excellent numerical efficiency provided by the bls method .",
    "comparison with bls reveals that @xmath268 has a close correspondence with their detection statistic sr , such that @xmath269 . if we assume constant noise , i.e.@xmath270 , and define @xmath271 to be the number of points in transit , then the effective signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath272 .    although , at fixed @xmath260 , analytic expressions can provide the significance of a given value of @xmath37 in the presence of pure gaussian noise , in the present case folding data over many trial periods and phases hampers determination of the significance of the global @xmath268 .",
    "thus , assessing the probability of achieving the observed outcome by chance involves taking into account the effective number of independent trials .",
    "several papers ( e.g. , bls , @xcite ) propose methods to address these issues .",
    "however , as we have shown , in the presence of correlated systematic errors , formulations with a gaussian - noise basis underestimate the detection thresholds needed to avoid falsely triggering on the systematic errors .",
    "generally , one must use the properties of the data themselves to set the appropriate detection threshold .    in general , a matched filter",
    "optimally detects a signal of known form in noisy data .",
    "however , the efficiency of boxcar fitting makes it highly advantageous , and as we show next nearly optimal for transit detection . this is because , for small planets and modest limb darkening , simple boxcars match well the planetary transit signal .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure [ fig : a1 ] , where we show @xmath273 , the difference in @xmath37 between a boxcar fit to a planetary transit across a limb - darkened star and the exact model fit , assuming uniform errors . in order to make the result independent of the error properties of the light curve , we plot this normalized to @xmath274 , the difference in @xmath37 between a constant flux fit to the light curve and the exact model fit .",
    "in other words , since @xmath275 is the total signal - to - noise ratio of the transit detection , the ratio @xmath276 is ( the square of ) the fractional degradation of the signal - to - noise ratio that arises from fitting the approximate boxcar form to the true transit shape .",
    "we show @xmath276 versus the impact parameter of the transit for four different values of @xmath277 and @xmath278 , as well as linear limb - darkening coefficients in the range @xmath279 .",
    "the fractional difference in @xmath280 is less than @xmath281 for impact parameters @xmath282 and @xmath283 , and it is always @xmath284 for the range of parameters relevant here . however",
    ", if the number of detections is a strong function of @xmath37 near the detection threshold , then even a @xmath285 change in @xmath37 can have a significant effect on the inferred detection probability .",
    "therefore , it is important to inject realistic transits when determining the recovery rate and detection probability , to account for the imperfect match of the boxcar filter",
