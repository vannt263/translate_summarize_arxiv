    "the determination of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) still represents one of the most crucial questions in astrophysics .",
    "in fact , it is a critical ingredient in the understanding of a large number of basic astronomical phenomena such as the formation of the first stars , galaxy formation and evolution , and the determination of the possible dark matter content of galaxy halos . after the pioneering study by salpeter ( 1955 ) ,",
    "a number of works have been carried out with the aim of studying the shape of the imf in the solar neighborhood ( miller & scalo 1979 ; larson 1998 ; chabrier 2001 ; kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "star clusters provides a useful tool to investigate the low - mass end of the imf .",
    "they offer the possibility of observing large samples of unevolved low - mass stars that are coeval and at the same distance with the same chemical composition .",
    "however , the derivation of the imf in star clusters is complicated by the tidal interaction with the galaxy that drives star clusters preferentially to lose low - mass stars across the tidal boundary as a result of the ever - continuing redistribution of energy on the two - body relaxation time - scale . de marchi et al . ( 2005 ) found that the luminosity function ( lf ) of galactic globular clusters ( gc ) is well reproduced by adopting a mass function ( mf ) in which the number of stars per unit mass decreases below a critical mass .",
    "table 1 lists the most used analytical descriptions of the imf available in literature .",
    "a number of other power - law indices have been measured in stellar associations and young star clusters in the local universe ( see kroupa 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "the stellar system @xmath0 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) is the most massive and luminous gc of the milky way ( m@xmath7 , van de ven et al .",
    "2006 ) and plays a key role in the understanding of the properties of the mass spectrum for low - mass stars .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2006 ) showed that the most massive objects in the cluster ( blue straggler stars and interacting binaries ) are not centrally segregated , at odds with any other gc .",
    "this evidence suggests that @xmath0 cen is still far from being completely relaxed even in the core region .",
    "for this reason its present - day mf should reflect the imf much more closely than in any other galactic gc .",
    "in this paper we measured the lf of @xmath0 cen by means of wide - field ground - based photometry using fors1 and acs@hst observations of a peripheral region of the cluster .",
    "the obtained lfs have been compared with the lfs of other galactic gcs and converted into mass function ( mf ) . in  2 we describe the observational material .",

    "however , as shown in  [ method ] , the shape of the lf is dominated by the metal - poor population of @xmath0 cen . for this reason we consider the",
    "mf derived here as representative of the dominant cluster population . * unresolved binary systems",
    "are shifted in the cmd toward brighter magnitudes and therefore can distort the derived mf .    to quantify the impact of a significant binary fraction in the shape of the derived mf",
    ", we performed a number of cmd simulation with different binary frequencies following the prescription of bellazzini et al .",
    "the binary population has been simulated by extracting random pairs of stars from a broken power - low mf with given indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the f814w and f606w fluxes of the binary components have been derived using the mass - luminosity relation of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and summed in order to obtain the magnitudes of the unresolved binary system .",
    "field stars were added following the procedure described in  [ field ] . in fig .",
    "[ binary ] the observed acs cmd and the synthetic cmd simulated with a fraction of binaries @xmath19 are shown .",
    "as expected , a significant number of binary systems populate the synthetic cmd in a region located redward with respect to the dominant cluster ms ( _ binary region _ ) .",
    "the comparison of the observed cmd with simulations accounting for a wide range of binary fractions indicates that the binary fraction in @xmath0 cen must be smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "note that at least part of the stars populating the _ binary region _ in the observed acs cmd could be single stars belonging to the metal - rich populations of @xmath0 cen , that are not considered in the simulated cmd .",
    "for this reason , the binary fraction estimated above represents an upper limit to the true binary fraction in this stellar system .",
    "then , we derived the lf of the simulated cmd adopting the same procedure described in the previous sections in order to quantify the effect of the presence of binary systems .",
    "we found that a broken power - low mf with indices @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) reproduces well the observed lf even assuming a binary fraction of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that binary stars have only a negligible effect on the shape of the mf in the considered mass range .    some of the analytical imf listed in table 1 and the present - day mf derived by de marchi et al .",

    "( 2005 , dotted line ) and kroupa ( 2002 , dashed line ) are overplotted.,width=328 ]",
    "in sect . [ resforsms ] we have shown that the ms - lf measured at different distances from the center does not show significant modifications , confirming that @xmath0 cen is still dynamically young .",
    "this result is in agreement with that found by anderson ( 1997 ) by comparing the observed ms - lf of @xmath0 cen with the theoretical predictions with and without equipartition and by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2006 ) on the basis of the comparison between the radial distribution of the blue straggler stars and _ normal _ less massive cluster stars .",
    "hence the observed ms - lf ( and the derived mf ) is expected to be essentially unaffected by _",
    "internal _ dynamical processes ( as e.g. mass segregation ) .",
    "note that the fact that the mf slope derived for @xmath0 cen is formally equal to that measured by reid & gizis ( 1997 ) for disk stars in the solar neighborhood fully supports this hypothesis .",
    "a number of works suggests that @xmath0 cen could be the remnant nucleus of a dwarf galaxy which merged in the past with the milky way ( see romano et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) . in this picture , the cluster experienced strong tidal losses during its interaction with the galaxy .",
    "n - body simulations by tsuchiya et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the system lost @xmath32 90% of its initial mass during the first 2 gyr .",
    "evidence that seems to confirm this hypothesis comes from the detection of a significant stellar overdensity resembling a pair of tidal tails surrounding @xmath0 cen ( leon et al .",
    "however , this result has been questioned by law et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who found that leon s et al .",
    "tidal tails were strongly correlated with inhomogeneities in the reddening distribution .",
    "note however that the lack of equipartition in @xmath0 cen should lead the system to lose stars independently on their masses .",
    "therefore , even strong stellar losses should not significantly distort the ms - lf of the cluster .",
    "hence , the ms - lf shown in fig .",
    "[ lfacs ] should reflect the global primordial luminosity distribution of ms stars in the cluster .",
    "if this consideration is true , the comparison of the ms - lf shown in figure 7 casts some doubts on the `` universality '' of the imf .",
    "in fact , under the assumption that all stellar systems formed their stars following a `` universal '' imf , we would expect to observe a general agreement in the ms - lf shape ( with respect to that measured in @xmath0 cen ) in poorly dynamically evolved clusters or a deficiency of faint ( low - mass ) stars in highly evolved clusters where dynamical effects have played a significant role . however in no cases we would expect to see an excess of low - mass stars .    indeed , as shown in figure 7 , the ms - lf of @xmath0 cen seems to share the same shape as that observed in m22 and m55 , but significant differences in the low - luminosity star content are apparent with respect to m15 and ngc6397 . in particular , while the overabundance of faint stars with respect to ngc6397 can be interpreted in terms of systematic evaporation of low - mass stars in the highly evolved cluster ngc6397 , the difference with respect to m15 is much more puzzling .",
    "indeed , if the lf in @xmath0 cen reflects the primordial lf of the cluster , the difference with respect to m15 could be interpreted only in terms of a `` real '' difference in the imf .",
    "it is worth of noticing that other two clusters in the piotto & zoccali ( 1999 ) sample ( m30 and m92 ) share the same behaviour of m15 , showing a significant overabundance of faint low - mass stars with respect to @xmath0 cen .",
    "the slopes of the low - mass end of the mf derived in these clusters by piotto & zoccali ( 1999 ) ( @xmath33 for m15 , m30 and m92 , respectively ) turn out to be smaller than that measured in this paper for @xmath0 cen ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , all of these clusters have a metallicity significantly lower ( @xmath34\\sim -2 $ ] ) than the mean metallicity of @xmath0 cen ( @xmath34\\sim-1.7 $ ] , suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) .    this evidence might suggest that a `` primordial '' difference in the imf of stellar systems as a function of the metallicity ( i.e. metal poor clusters tend to produce more low - mass stars ) could exist .",
    "the physical reason for this might be found in the higher efficiency of the fragmentation process in low - metallicity proto - cluster clouds ( see silk 1977 ) .",
    "a possible dependence of the slope of the faint end of the clusters mfs on metallicity was also discussed and not excluded by piotto & zoccali ( 1999 ) .",
    "note that a similar result was also presented by mcclure et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and djorgovski , piotto & capaccioli ( 1993 ) from the analysis of the lf of several galactic gcs .",
    "clearly a deeper investigation is required to finally address this important question .",
    "however , the evidence presented here supports the possibility that the mf measured in @xmath0 cen could be a reasonable approximation of the cluster imf and that a variation of the imf slope with the cluster metallicity could exist .",
