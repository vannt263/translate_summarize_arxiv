    "a longitudinal wave travelling through a fluid imparts a net drift motion to the suspended particles - an effect known as _",
    "drift_. the _ classical _ stokes drift  @xcite refers only to the deterministic behavior , i.e. it does not account for the stochastic fluctuations or perturbations in the system .",
    "it has been extensively studied in various practical contexts like , for instance , the motion of tracers in meteorology and oceanography  @xcite and that of the ( doping ) impurities in crystal growth  @xcite .",
    "a simple intuitive explanation of classical stokes drift is that the suspended particles spend a longer time in the regions of the wave - train where the force due to the wave acts in the direction of wave s propagation than the time spent in those regions where the force acts in the opposite direction ; therefore particles are driven in the sense of wave s propagation .",
    "when several linearly superposed waves are present , the resulting drift velocity is simply the sum of the contributions from each wave  @xcite .    recently , there has been some interest in _ stochastic _",
    "stokes drift  ( @xcite , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that the diffusive motion of the suspended particles can significantly alter the amplitude of the drift velocity .",
    "but it is the merit of  @xcite to open stochastic stokes drift to further investigation by putting it in its natural context , namely _ ratchet - like brownian motors _ in which the thermal motion of small ( microscopic ) particles is rectified by an asymmetric time - dependent potential  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is referred to as the _ flashing ratchet_. paper  @xcite is limited to the case when the motion of the overdamped suspended particles is diffusion - dominated , i.e. when the deterministic forcing due to the wave is very weak .",
    "an approximate perturbative technique is developed for calculating the drift velocity in arbitrary dimensions , which shows that the drift depends on particles diffusivity in magnitude and , in more than 1d , also in direction ( a very appealing feature , useful in particle selection devices - see , for example , in  @xcite doering et all , 1994 , and in  @xcite m. bier , 1996 ) .",
    "papers @xcite and , in a very different context  @xcite , give an exact integral expression for stokes drift of overdamped diffusive particles in 1d , for arbitrary wave forms . using a fokker - planck equation technique",
    ", it finds that white noise reduces stokes drift by comparison to its classical ( deterministic ) value , the flux reversal being absent .",
    "the purpose of this short communication is to show that the characteristics of the 1d stokes drift may become more complex ( including flux reversal or enhancement of the classical drift ) when the particles are subjected to stochastic forcing that is non - white ( i.e. it has a finite correlation time ) .",
    "we will focus on the case of dichotomic markov forcing , in which the particle is subjected to a randomly alternating force , in addition to the force exerted by the wave . for this choice of coloured noise , explicit analytic results",
    "can be obtained , while this is not the case for other types of coloured noise , including the ornstein - uhlenbeck process . even though the time - average of the dichotomic force is taken to be zero ,",
    "its effect in conjunction with the asymmetry of the wave s perturbation is highly nontrivial .",
    "as such the model realizes in the stokes drift context another paradigm of brownian motors , namely that of the so - called _",
    "rocking ratchet_. in this scenario , the systematic motion acquired under influence of an alternating zero - average force essentially revolves on the asymmetry of the nonlinear response in the presence of a steady but asymmetric potential  @xcite .",
    "the dichotomic markov forcing presents another important advantage in that the exact integral expression for stokes drift can be derived .",
    "furthermore , in some cases of interest , the resulting integrals can be evaluated explicitly .",
    "our analytic results are also complemented with computer simulations , which are found to be in full agreement with the theory .",
    "the starting point is the following stochastic differential equation :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a symmetric dichotomic noise ( a two - step markov process )  @xcite .",
    "it can take only two values , @xmath2 , with equal probability , jumping between them with a probability @xmath3 per unit time .",
    "it has zero mean and its autocorrelation function @xmath4 shows a finite correlation time @xmath5 .    with a suitable time scaling , eq.([eq1 ] ) models the 1d overdamped motion of a brownian particle subjected to a dichotomic forcing .",

    "the quantity of interest is the _ drift velocity _ , which represents the mean velocity of the particles in the long time limit : @xmath13 where the mean is to be taken over the realisations of the dichotomic noise . by defining a new variable @xmath14",

    "in conclusion , the rocking ratchet version for stokes drift reveals two new features , which are to be attributed to the colour ( finite correlation time ) of the applied force : the drift is enhanced by small amplitude perturbations , while a flux reversal occurs at sufficiently large amplitude and large correlation time . while our calculations are limited to the case of dichotomic markov noise , we expect that similar results hold for other coloured noises .    in",
    "@xcite it was reported that , in two dimensions , both the direction and amplitude of the stokes drift can change with the intensity of the brownian motion when several waves are present .",
