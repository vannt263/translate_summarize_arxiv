    "many important areas of experimental and theoretical physics , chemistry , and materials science require an understanding of the electronic excitations of atomic or molecular systems , nanostructures , mesoscopic systems , or bulk materials.@xcite a wide variety of spectroscopic techniques is being used to characterize the electronic structure and dynamics of these systems by probing their excitation spectra .",
    "the performance of any nanoelectronic device , such as a molecular junction , is dominated by its electronic excitations .",
    "@xcite    time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite is an increasingly popular , universal approach to electronic dynamics and excitations . just like ground - state density - functional theory ( dft ) , which is based on a set of rigorous theorems @xcite proving a one - to - one correspondence between ground - state densities and potentials",
    ", there is a similar existence theorem for tddft , due to runge and gross , @xcite which establishes the time - dependent density as a fundamental variable .    the usage of tddft as a practical tool to calculate excitation energies started in the mid-90 s with the groundbreaking work of petersilka _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and casida .",
    "@xcite in the casida - formalism , the excitation energies are obtained from the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath0 where the matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined as follows : @xmath3 and @xmath4 \\varphi_{i'\\sigma'}({\\bf r } ' ) \\varphi^*_{a'\\sigma'}({\\bf r}').\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the kohn - sham orbitals and eigenvalues coming from a self - consistent ground - state dft calculation ; we use the standard convention that @xmath7 are indices of occupied orbitals and @xmath8 refer to unoccupied orbitals .",
    "@xmath9 is the so - called exchange - correlation ( xc ) kernel,@xcite which is in general a frequency - dependent quantity , but in practice is often approximated using frequency - independent expressions .",
    "this is known as the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath10 of equation ( [ casida ] ) are , in principle , the _ exact _ excitation energies of the system , provided one would start from an exact kohn - sham ground - state calculation and then use the exact @xmath11 . in practice , of course , static and dynamical xc functionals need to be approximated . the formalism of equations ( [ casida])-([kmat ] ) can also be recast in the shape of an eigenvalue problem for the squares of the excitation energies : @xmath12\\xi_{a'i'\\sigma'}=\\omega^2 \\xi_{ai\\sigma}\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "this tddft formalism for excitation energies has become very popular for practical applications , and is nowadays implemented as an integral part of several widely used software packages in theoretical chemistry .",
    "@xcite overall , tddft affords a unique balance between accuracy and efficiency , allowing the user to study systems that would be impossible to treat with traditional wavefunction methods , for example in all - electron studies of the photochemistry of large biomolecules .",
    "@xcite to describe localized and delocalized electronic excitations in large conjugated and aggregated molecules , tddft has also been used along semiempirical hamiltonian models or approaches based on the kohn - sham density matrix such as the collective electronic oscillator ( ceo ) model . @xcite",
    "the broad spectrum of applications of tddft for excited states has been recently reviewed by elliott _",
    "@xcite from the large body of available literature , the following trends for molecules have emerged .",
    "transition frequencies , calculated with standard gradient - corrected xc functionals are typically good to within 0.4 ev .",
    "excited - states structural properties such as bond lengths , vibrational frequencies and dipole moments are essentially as good as those of ground - state calculations ( about 1 % for bond lengths , and about 5 % for dipoles and vibrational frequencies ) .",
    "most importantly for large systems , the computational costs scale as @xmath14 , versus @xmath15 for wavefunction methods of comparable accuracy ( eg ccsd , casscf ) .",
    "while there exist efficient iterative algorithms for solving the full eigenvalue problem ( [ casida ] ) , it is nevertheless useful to consider approximations , since these can lead to further insight .",
    "the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) neglects the off - diagonal matrices @xmath2 in equation ( [ casida ] ) , which results in the simpler eigenvalue problem @xmath16 physically , the tda is the tddft analog of the configuration interaction singles ( cis ) method.@xcite the tda has some technical advantages away from ground - state equilibrium geometry , as discussed by casida _",
    "_ in ref . .",
    "in an even more drastic approximation , equation ( [ eigen ] ) is truncated down to a @xmath17 matrix .",
    "this yields the so - called small - matrix approximation ( sma ) , @xcite which for spin - saturated systems is given by @xmath18 this can be further approximated if the correction to the bare kohn - sham excitation energy @xmath19 is small , which is known as single - pole approximation ( spa):@xcite @xmath20 this approximation can also be viewed as a tda for a two - level system .",
    "below , we shall present an alternative , more direct derivation of the sma and spa .",
    "it turns out that these two approximations perform surprisingly well for simple closed - shell atomic systems .",
    "@xcite this might perhaps be viewed as merely a curiosity  after all , one can describe such systems with the full casida tddft formalism without resorting to any approximation .",
    "however , the sma and spa can prove very useful for situations such as extended systems where the full casida formalism can not be easily applied , and we shall hence focus on such cases .    the purpose of this paper is to present a discussion of simplified tddft approaches to excitation energies in bulk materials and quantum wells .",
    "we will begin with a simple and pedagogical derivation of the small - matrix and single - pole approximation for a two - level kohn - sham system",
    ". we will then show how these expressions can be easily modified and generalized for the case of collective excitations in extended systems .",
    "in this way , one can arrive at a simple treatment of excitonic effects in bulk insulators , and plasmon - like excitations in doped semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "some examples will be discussed .",

    "we are thus looking for an `` eigenmode '' of the system in a steady - state .",

    "the spa , equation ( [ spa ] ) , on the other hand , only includes the excitation @xmath58 [ it is obtained by ignoring the first pole in equation ( [ poles ] ) ] . in general",
    ", the tda ( [ tda ] ) ignores all de - excitations .",
    "the standard ab - initio treatment of excitation processes in insulators and semiconductors , including correlation - induced screening , is based on many - body green s function techniques such as gw and the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "@xcite however , tddft has recently emerged as an alternative , computationally convenient approach to electronic excitation processes in materials .",
    "@xcite as discussed above , excitation energies can be calculated in principle exactly in tddft , provided the xc kernel @xmath59 is known , and one starts with an exact ground - state calculation .",
    "this statement is true not only for finite systems such as molecules , but remains valid for extended systems . in refs .",
    ", an approximate @xmath60 was constructed from many - body green s functions , whereas ref .",
    "uses an exact - exchange approach , including a cutoff in wavevector space which mimics screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite these studies have established that tddft is capable of describing excitonic effects in solids , although one has to use xc functionals that go beyond the more common ones such as the adiabatic local - density approximation .",
    "@xcite the resulting agreement with experimental data is excellent , @xcite but the technical effort is not significantly less than that of standard many - body approaches .        in the following ,",
    "let us for simplicity consider a two - band insulator with valence and conduction band energies @xmath61 and @xmath62 and associated bloch functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the single - particle interband transition energies are simply given by @xmath65 .",
    "a tddft formalism for nonlinear ultrafast interband excitations has recently been developed , @xcite which describes the electron dynamics of a two - band system via a generalization of the semiconductor bloch equations .",
    "this work has shown that tddft is capable of producing excitonic signatures in the interband dynamics .",
    "we now briefly outline a simpler and more direct tddft approach for excitonic binding energies.@xcite    to describe excitonic effects in the interband absorption spectrum of insulators , one needs to go beyond the single - particle picture and include dynamical many - body effects . in tddft ,",
    "this is accomplished through the dynamical xc kernel @xmath59 .",
    "let us illustrate this for the simple case of our two - band insulator .",

    "this shows explicitly that excitons are collective excitations which involve not only the states at the valence - band maximum and conduction - band minimum ( for direct excitons ) , but the states of the entire bands .",
    "a schematic illustration is given in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "explicit evaluations of equations ( [ singlepole ] ) and ( [ fxcmat ] ) are currently in progress.@xcite    the tddft formalism of ref .",
    "can in principle also be used to treat higher - order correlation effects such as biexciton formation .",
    "these effects are especially important in the description of the ultrafast nonlinear optical response in semiconductors ( bulk and nanostructured ) .",
    "@xcite such nonlinear effects , which are entirely governed by dynamical correlations , can be expected to put severe demands on the xc functionals , and will be the subject of future studies .",
    "the terahertz frequency regime is scientifically rich , but despite recent progress it is technologically still underdeveloped .",
    "@xcite subband spacings in typical iii - v quantum wells are of the order of a few tens of mev .",
    "since a photon energy of 10 mev corresponds to a frequency of 2.4 thz , intersubband transitions in quantum wells appear as natural candidates for device applications to fill the `` terahertz gap '' in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "a schematic illustration of intersubband transitions is given in the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the fundamental coupling mechanism between electromagnetic waves and carriers in a doped semiconductor quantum well is through a collective excitation , the so - called intersubband plasmon . to date , most applications of tddft linear response theory in quantum wells have been concerned with calculating intersubband plasmon dispersions and linewidths .",
    "@xcite due to its highly collective nature , and since the dynamics is essentially one - dimensional , intersubband plasmons in quantum wells are an ideal testing ground for new tddft approaches . a review of recent applications of tddft to the electron dynamics in semiconductor nanostructure is given in ref . .",
    "of intersubband excitations in a quantum well .",
    "collective charge and spin plasmon excitations ( cp and sp ) are separated from the region of incoherent single - particle excitations . ]",
    "let us now extend our discussion to include charge as well as spin plasmon excitations .",
    "the physical picture of these excitations is that in a charge plasmon the spin - up and spin - down electrons in the quantum well move collectively in phase , whereas in a spin plasmon they move 180 degrees out of phase .",
    "these excitations have a dependence on the in - plane wavevector @xmath69 , which is schematically illustrated in fig . [ fig2 ] . in the @xmath70 plane ,",
    "one distinguishes an area of incoherent single - particle excitations ( also known as landau damping ) , and two discrete plasmon branches .",
    "the charge plasmon lies above the single - particle regime , and the spin plasmon lies below .",
    "experimentally , this is confirmed via inelastic light scattering spectroscopy.@xcite    we shall in the following discuss how tddft describes the charge and spin plasmons in quantum wells .",
    "we adopt the effective - mass approximation for electronic states in doped semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "let @xmath71 be the electronic sheet density ( the number of electrons per area ) , which is chosen so that only the lowest subband is occupied .",
    "it is assumed that the direction of growth , and thus of quantum confinement , of the quantum well is along the @xmath72-axis , and electrons are free to move in the @xmath73-@xmath74 plane . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only the first and the second subband .    the intersubband charge and spin plasmon frequencies @xmath75 are determined by the condition that the following @xmath76 matrix equation , @xmath77 has eigenvalue @xmath78 .",

    "a detailed derivation of equations ( [ matrixelements])-([ffun ] ) will be published elsewhere.@xcite    the matrix elements @xmath86 of equation ( [ matrixelements ] ) contain various xc contributions .",
    "the first xc term features @xmath87 in the adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda ) .",
    "@xcite this term is frequency independent and real , and therefore by itself gives rise to plasmon excitations that have no imaginary part , and thus have an infinite lifetime .",
    "in reality , since quantum wells are extended systems , plasmons are intrinsically damped .",
    "finite plasmon linewidths arise from the other xc terms in equation ( [ matrixelements ] ) , featuring the viscosity coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the spin coulomb drag transresistivity @xmath90 .",
    "these terms originate @xcite in the context of time - dependent current - dft , and have been extensively studied for quantum wells.@xcite    one can simplify things for the case of vanishing in - plane wavevector , @xmath91 , and ignoring the xc contributions beyond alda ( which in general have only a minor influence on the plasmon frequency ) . in that case",
    ", one obtains a straightforward generalization of the sma for quantum wells as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 \\varphi_{1}(z ) \\varphi_{2}(z ) \\varphi_{1}(z ' ) \\varphi_{2}(z')\\:.\\ ] ] the hartree contribution in @xmath94 is known as `` depolarization shift '' , and the xc contribution is sometimes ( somewhat misleadingly ) called `` excitonic shift '' .",
    "the hartree part always induces an up - shift of the plasmon frequency with respect to @xmath95 , and the xc part gives a smaller down - shift . in the charge plasmon ,",
    "the positive shift dominates , but for the spin plasmon , the hartree parts cancel out in eq .",
    "( [ 3.15 ] ) and the spin plasmon frequency is redshifted with respect to the single - particle excitation region , see fig .",
    "this is a remarkable result : the existence of the collective intersubband spin plasmon is purely a consequence of xc effects .",
    "the picture that emerges from these studies is that tddft has been extremely successful in describing excitations in doped semiconductor nanostructures ( which are essentially metallic systems , in contrast with the insulators discussed in the previous section ) , already at the level of the simplest xc approximations .",
    "currently , work is in progress where the formalism is generalized to more realistic descriptions of the semiconductor materials , for example including spin - orbit coupling effects",
    "in this paper , we have given a brief overview of the tddft methodology to calculate excitation energies in materials .",
    "the basic formalism , which is widely used in popular quantum chemistry software packages , is based on casida s equation ( [ casida ] ) .",
    "this approach is universal and in principle capable of producing the exact excitation energies of any system and material , provided that xc effects are properly accounted for .    besides the full formalism , it is instructive to consider simplified approaches which are based , in one way or another , on truncations of the matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 of equation ( [ casida ] ) , leading to the sma or spa .",
    "we have shown how these approaches can be formulated for excitations in bulk materials and doped semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "this allows for a straightforward discussion of excitonic effects in insulators , and intersubband plasmons in quantum wells . in both cases",
    "we have given explicit expressions for calculating the collective excitations .",
    "for extended systems , tddft not only gives the excitation energies in principle exactly , but also the linewidths .",
    "however , the success of tddft critically depends upon the quality of the xc functionals used .",
    "simple local and semilocal functionals , such as the lda or gga , usually work fine for most applications for molecular systems.@xcite on the other hand , there are situations which are difficult to deal with , namely a proper description of double excitations or of charge - transfer excitations in large molecules . in these cases , one needs to go beyond the adiabatic approximation and use an xc kernel @xmath59 which is explicitly frequency - dependent.@xcite the exploration of non - adiabatic xc effects in tddft remains a subject of intense investigation.@xcite    for extended insulating or semiconducting systems ( inorganic as well as organic ) , the situation is even more complicated .",
    "a proper description of excitonic effects in the optical absorption of such materials requires long - range xc kernels.@xcite standard xc functionals such as lda and gga fail to produce any excitonic effects , and are in fact completely incapable of shifting the kohn - sham band edge.@xcite it has been demonstrated @xcite that one can construct xc kernels which produce absorption spectra in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "however , these kernels are technically involved and do not lead to major computational advantages compared to green s function based techniques . it remains an important task for tddft to construct parameter - free expressions for @xmath60 which accurately reproduce excitonic effects in solids , yet are simple enough to implement in practice .",
    "work along these lines is in progress ."
