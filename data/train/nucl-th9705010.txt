    "recently , it has been proposed to study the structure of the proton by the reaction @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that this process contains , in addition to electron bremsstrahlung ( bethe  heitler scattering ) , the amplitude of virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) off the proton , @xmath3 . in general , compton scattering as a two step process allows to extract information on the excitation spectrum of the target .",
    "an overview of the various aspects of vcs can be found in ref .",
    "vcs is of particular interest below pion production threshold , where the information about the excited states of the nucleon can be parametrized by means of the generalized electromagnetic polarizabilities .",
    "these generalized polarizabilities emerge as coefficients if the non born amplitude of vcs is expanded in terms of the final photon energy @xmath4 . as has been demonstrated by guichon et al .",
    "@xcite , the leading term of such an expansion contains 10 generalized polarizabilities , 3 of them in the spin  independent amplitude ( scalar polarizabilities ) and 7 in the spin  flip amplitude ( vector polarizabilities ) .",
    "in contrast to real compton scattering ( rcs ) , the generalized polarizabilities in vcs are functions depending on the four  momentum transfer @xmath5 .    at present , three experimental programs are under way to determine the generalized polarizabilities . at mami , data have been taken at @xmath6 @xcite . there also exist plans to investigate vcs at even lower values of @xmath5 at mit ",
    "bates @xcite , while the activities at jefferson lab will concentrate on the region of higher @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in an unpolarized experiment only 3 independent linear combinations of the polarizabilities can be determined @xcite .",
    "a separate measurement of all polarizabilities is only possible by use of double polarization observables , e.g. , the reaction @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a careful treatment of radiative corrections is unavoidable as their contributions are comparable to the polarizability effects @xcite .    regarding the expansion in @xmath8 for rcs",
    ", higher order terms can not be neglected at photon energies larger than about @xmath9 . in order to guarantee the dominance of the leading order term ,",
    "the energy of the real photon should also satisfy @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the energy of the initial nucleon in the _ cm _ system and @xmath12 the nucleon mass @xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 has to be much smaller than the three ",
    "momentum @xmath13 of the virtual photon ( see section [ kap_2 ] ) . if @xmath8 and @xmath13 are of the same order of magnitude , the amplitude has to be expanded in both variables ( see ref .",

    "the extension of this work to the nucleon leads to 36 independent low energy constants entering the non  born vcs amplitude to fifth order @xcite . while it is certainly hopeless to measure these parameters , we want to emphasize the importance of a reliable estimate of the higher order terms , except for very small values of @xmath8 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the combined symmetry of charge conjugation and nucleon crossing results in unexpected relations between the vcs multipoles , beyond the usual constraints of parity and angular momentum conservation @xcite . as a consequence , only 2 independent scalar and",
    "4 independent vector polarizabilities exist .",
    "the generalized polarizabilities of the proton were first predicted by use of the constituent quark model ( cqm ) @xcite .",
    "further calculations in an effective lagrangian model @xcite , the linear sigma model ( lsm ) @xcite , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , and the skyrme model @xcite focused on the scalar polarizabilities and the spin  independent vcs amplitude . in the meantime",
    ", the vector polarizabilities have been evaluated on the basis of chpt @xcite and in a coupled  channel unitary model @xcite .",
    "the present contribution completes our earlier work on the lsm @xcite by presenting the results for the vector polarizabilities .",
    "since the model is chirally invariant , we expect similar results as in chpt for @xmath14 , and in addition a reasonable estimate for the @xmath5 dependence of the polarizabilities .",
    "for convenience we briefly repeat the definition of the kinematical variables for the vcs reaction @xcite @xmath15 the _ cm _ energies and three  momenta of the involved particles are denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the polarization vectors of both photons can be chosen to be spacelike , i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , noting that the time  like component of the virtual photon can be eliminated by current conservation . while the outgoing photon is purely transverse ( helicity @xmath19 ) , the incoming photon has also longitudinal polarization ( @xmath20 ) , denoted by @xmath21 . in the following we also use the definitions @xmath22 with @xmath23 .    with the convention of bjorken and drell @xcite for the invariant matrix element",

    "@xmath72 the ratio of the predictions reaches three orders of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that most of the vector polarizabilities are dominated by virtual excitations of nonresonant @xmath104 scattering states . only in the case of @xmath71 ,",
    "the result of the lsm is small compared to the cqm , which is due to the strong influence of the @xmath85 resonance on that polarizability .",
