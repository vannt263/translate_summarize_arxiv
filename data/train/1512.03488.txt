    "thermodynamics is one of the four pillars of theoretical physics and provides us with an essential way to study the thermodynamic process such as heat engine which can be dated back to carnot [ 1 ] .",
    "when we consider the physical nature down to the quantum level , quantum thermodynamics which is the intersection of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics , provides a new approach to investigate the microscopic physics .",
    "quantum thermodynamics has attracted more and more interests such as in refs .",
    "[ 2 - 4 ] and the references therein . in particular , quantum heat engine has been extensively studied [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "it was shown that quantum heat engine has the remarkable similarity to the classical engines which obey macroscopic dynamics and carnot efficiency has been a well established limit for some quantum heat engines [ 13 - 17 ] . a lot of works have been done especially related to quantum analogues of carnot engines [ 18 - 22 ] , whilst some other cycles such as otto cycles [ 23 - 26 ] and brownian motions [ 27 ] are also covered with considerable progress . all above provide microscopic alternatives to test the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and deepen our understanding of quantum thermodynamics .",
    "recently , the concept of the self - contained quantum refrigerator has been raised for the questions about the fundamental limitation on the size of thermal machines and their relevant topics [ 28 - 32 ] .",
    "it is shown that the ` self - contained ' means 1 ) all degrees of freedom of the refrigerator are taken into account ; 2 ) no external source of work is allowed ; and 3 ) in particular , time - dependent hamiltonians or prescribed unitary transformations are not allowed . however , the key in their model is that they required the interaction ( the coupling ) between their three qubits was weak enough , but the coupling and the decay rate are on the same order .",
    "in other words , the self - contained refrigerator works in the regime of weak internal coupling . since the three - qubit interaction is the vital driving mechanism for the cooling , could a strong internal interaction ( coupling ) provide a more effective power ?    in this paper ,",
    "we revisit the same model proposed in ref . [ 28 ] in the strong internal coupling regime .",
    "we employ the quantum optical master equation to study the steady - state heat currents and the cooling efficiency . as the main result",
    ", we find that the strong internal coupling plays a negative role in the cooling ability .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of such a model could also be different from and even opposite to those in the weak internal coupling regime .",
    "in addition , it is shown that our results will be consistent with those in ref . [ 28 ] ( the weak internal coupling ) if we reduce the internal coupling strength , although our master equation , in principle , is only suitable for the strong internal coupling .",
    "this implies that the validity of the application of the quantum master equation deserves our further consideration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the interacting mechanism of the refrigerator and derive the master equation . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our main results and make some necessary analysis .",
    "the conclusion is obtained finally .",
    "the refrigerator we considered here is made up of three atoms denoted , respectively , by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the free hamiltonian of the three - atom system is given by @xmath3where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , is the transition frequency of atom @xmath7 , and @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting the excited state and the ground state . in particular , in order to guarantee the resonant interaction , it is required that @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that the interaction of the three atoms is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 : @xmath13with @xmath14 the coupling constant and @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the hamiltonian of the closed system reads @xmath17 here we set the planck constant and boltzmann s constant to be unit , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "in the framework of self - contained refrigerator [ 28,30 ] , all the atoms should interact with a reservoir respectively , instead of a real working source .",
    "so we let atom @xmath2 be connected with a hot reservoir with the temperature denoted by @xmath19 , atom @xmath0 be in contact with a `` room '' reservoir with temperature @xmath20 and atom @xmath1 interact with a cold reservoir with temperature @xmath21 .",
    "thus it is naturally implied that @xmath22 . here",
    "we assume that all the reservoirs consist of infinite harmonic oscillators with closely spaced frequencies @xmath23 and annihilation operators @xmath24 .",
    "note that the subscript @xmath25 marks the atom which the corresponding reservoir interacts with .",
    "thus one can write the total hamiltonian of the open system as @xmath26where @xmath27 is the free hamiltonian of the @xmath28th reservoir , and @xmath29with @xmath30 denoting the coupling constant , describes the interaction between the @xmath25th atom and its thermal reservoir . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , i.e. , the total hamiltonian , in principle , one can obtain all the dynamics of the refrigerator and the reservoirs .",
    "to do so , we have to derive a master equation that governs the evolution of the system of interests .",
    "next , we will follow the standard procedure [ 33,34 ] to find such a master equation .",
    "since the refrigerator ( excluding the reservoirs ) is a composite quantum system , the first step is to diagonalize the refrigerator hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "it is shown that the diagonalized @xmath31 can be written as @xmath32 , where the eigenvalues are given by @xmath33 = [ \\omega _ { r},\\omega _ { h},g,-\\omega _ { c},\\omega _ { c},-g,-\\omega _ { h},-\\omega _ { r}],\\]]and @xmath34 denote the corresponding eigenvectors with the concrete form omitted here . in @xmath35 representation",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath2 can be rewritten as@xmath36where @xmath37with @xmath38 denoting the eigenoperators of the refrigerator hamiltonian @xmath31 such that @xmath39=-w_{\\mu j}v_{\\mu j}(w_{\\mu j})$ ] and @xmath40 standing for the eigenfrequency .",

    "@xmath42where @xmath43 is implied , otherwise , @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that the system and their reservoirs are initially separable and the initial states of the reservoirs are the thermal equilibrium states .",
    "in particular , we assume that the coupling between the system and the reservoirs is weak enough . based on the born - markovian approximations , one can derive the master equation as @xmath45+\\mathcal{l}_{r}[\\rho ] + \\mathcal{l}% _ { h}[\\rho ] , \\]]where the dissipators read @xmath46=\\sum_{j}j_{\\mu } \\left ( -w_{\\mu j}\\right ) \\left [ 2v_{\\mu j}\\left ( w_{\\mu j}\\right ) \\rho",

    "in addition , we employed the rotating wave approximation , which implies @xmath51 .",
    "this condition requires that the master equation is only suitable for the large @xmath14 .",

    "however , the concrete form of @xmath80 is so tedious that we can not write it here .",

    "( 40 ) , we plot the heat currents in fig . 1 . here",

    "in addition , we let the room temperature be @xmath86 and the temperature of the cold reservoir be @xmath87 ( of course , if the other parameters are chosen , one will get the similar results ) .",
    "when the temperature of the hot reservoir is low , the heat will flow into the cold reservoir .",
    "so the cold atom @xmath1 is heated .",
    "however , with the temperature of the hot reservoir increasing , one can find that all the heat currents will become zero simultaneously when @xmath88 ( so long as the coupling @xmath89 and the decay rate @xmath90 are small enough . ) .",
    "this virtual temperature @xmath91 is just consistent with ref .",
    "[ 32 ] which is closely related to ref .",
    "in addition , one can also see that the heat currents are increasing with the increase of @xmath19 .",
    "that is , the thermodynamic machine works as a refrigerator .",
    "an obvious feature is that the heat currents subject to the hot reservoir and the cold reservoir have the same direction ( sign ) and the sign is determined by the virtual temperature @xmath92 .",
    "however , if @xmath93 , one will find that no matter how large @xmath19 is , @xmath94 is always less than zero .",
    "in addition , we also consider the efficiency of the quantum refrigerator , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "the efficiency @xmath95 is defined by @xmath96 which was deeply studied in ref . [ 30 ] . in a simple way , it can be understood as that , by extracting heat ( current ) @xmath97 from the hot reservoir , we are able to extract heat ( current ) @xmath54 from the cold reservoir whilst dumping heat ( flow ) @xmath98 into the reservoir @xmath0 . it was also shown that @xmath95 for the self - contained refrigerator in ref . [ 28 ] was given by @xmath99 .",
    "take the current parameters into account , it should be @xmath100 . from our fig .",

    "the peak will be explained in the next part .",

    "3 with different @xmath14 .",
    "one will immediately see that the large @xmath14 directly leads to the suppression of the heat current @xmath94 .",
    "compared with the case of weak coupling , the high temperature @xmath19 could have the negative role in the cooling of the cold atom .",
    "it is obvious that the atom c can not be cooled if the coupling strength @xmath14 is too large , which is opposite to the case of weak internal coupling regime .",
    "in particular , given @xmath21 , @xmath20 and all the frequencies , one will see that the cooling only happens within some range of @xmath19 , which has also been shown in fig .",
    "thus the direct conclusion is that the strong coupling is not beneficial to the cooling from the point of refrigerator of view .",
    "in addition , one can also find that the heat currents do nt meet at a single point ( temperature ) , which is quite different from the weak coupling case .",
    "the heat currents do nt change their direction simultaneously .",
    "in particular , the heat current @xmath94 seems not to be directly relevant to the virtual temperature @xmath92 .",

    "the efficiency depends on the coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "the numerical results are given in fig .",
    "it is shown that the efficiency will become larger if @xmath14 becomes less .",
    "it will arrive at a constant efficiency ( @xmath117 ) when it reaches the weak coupling limit .",
    "however , the efficiency will change with @xmath19 if it is still in the case of strong coupling .",
    "the peak of the efficiency mainly results from the suppression of cooling induced by the strong coupling .",
    "in particular , the suppression becomes strong for large @xmath118 .",
    "when the reservoir @xmath2 is hot enough , the reservoir could be heated instead of cooled , which can be obviously found for @xmath119 . when the internal coupling become weak",
    ", the suppression will be weakened .",
    "if it is weak enough , the suppression wo nt be so apparent that the peak can be neglected to some good approximation , which is just illustrated in fig .",
    "when @xmath120 , one can also find that no matter what the coupling constant is , it is impossible to make a refrigerator .",
    "however , from a different angle , we can find that in the weak coupling limit , @xmath121 is reduced if we increase @xmath19 .",
    "on the contrary , when the coupling is strong , @xmath121 become large with @xmath19 increasing .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "in summary , we have revisited the self - contained refrigerator in the strong internal coupling regime by employing the quantum optical master equation .",
    "we find that the strong internal coupling reduces the cooling ability .",
    "in particular , in this regime , the considered machine demonstrates quite different ( and even converse ) thermodynamic behaviors compared with that in ref . [ 28 ] .",
    "in addition , we find that the quantum optical master equation provides the consistent results with the ref . [ 28 ] in the weak internal coupling regime , even though the rotating wave approximation , in principle , does not allow the weak internal coupling .",
