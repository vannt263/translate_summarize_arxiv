    "the study of bilayer graphene ( blg ) is a focused area in the condensed - matter physics because of the potential application of blg to new electronic devices.@xcite one of the fundamental subjects is to explore the physics of the ground state of electrons in blg .",
    "a number of experiments @xcite performed on high quality suspended blg samples have provided the evidence that the ground state is gapped at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) . in particular , a recent experiment by velasco _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has observed that ( i ) the ground state is insulating in the absence of external electric and magnetic fields , with a gap @xmath2 2 mev that can be closed by a perpendicular electric field of either polarization , ( ii ) the gap grows with increasing magnetic field @xmath0 as @xmath3 with @xmath4 1 mev and @xmath5 5.5 mevt@xmath6 , and ( iii ) the state is particle - hole asymmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "theories have predicted various gapped states , such as a ferroelectric - layer asymmetric state @xcite or quantum valley hall state ( qvh),@xcite a layer - polarized antiferromagnetic state ( af),@xcite a quantum anomalous hall state ( qah),@xcite a quantum spin hall state ( qsh ) , @xcite and a superconducting state in coexistence with antiferromagnetism ( saf ) .",
    "@xcite the ferroelectric - layer asymmetric and qah and qsh states all have been ruled out by the experiment.@xcite the saf state is excluded because the real system is an insulator . the af state can not reproduce the gap behavior with varying the magnetic field .",
    "recently , the loop - current state has been studied by numerical diagonalization of an effective mean - field hamiltonian for a finite size lattice @xcite and by analytically solving a two - band continuum model ( 2bcm ) .",
    "@xcite whether the model of this state agrees with the experimental observations on the electronic properties of blg remains a question .    in this work , using the four - band continuum model ( 4bcm ) for electrons with finite - range repulsive interactions in blg , we study the ordered - current state ( ocs ) at the cnp with a rigorous formalism and compare the results with the experimental observations .",
    "the importance of using the 4bcm to describe quantitatively the many - body properties of the electron liquid in the blg has been stressed by the existing works.@xcite we here investigate the gap behavior of the ocs with varying the magnetic field @xmath0 , and the particle - hole asymmetry spectra at finite @xmath0 , and the phase transitions in the electron system in the presence of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we will show that the puzzles ( i)-(iii ) of the experimental observations can be resolved by the present model of the ocs . with the same 4bcm",
    ", we also study the af state and show that the af state is not able to reproduce the experimental result for the gap as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the lattice structure of a blg is shown in fig .",

    "2 . for the carrier concentration close to the cnp , we need to consider only the states with momenta close to the dirac points @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "we hereafter use the units of @xmath31 = 1 and @xmath32 = 1 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number deviation of electrons with spin @xmath20 from its average occupation at site @xmath35 of sublattice @xmath23 ( hereafter denoted as @xmath36 for short ) , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the on - site interaction , and @xmath39 is the interaction between electrons at sites @xmath36 and @xmath40 . within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , since the interaction @xmath39 appears in the exchange self - energy , it can be considered as a finite - range interaction by taking into account the screening effect due to the electronic charge fluctuations.@xcite the total hamiltonian @xmath41 satisfies the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "in the ordered - current state for which there is no antiferromagnetism , the effective interaction under the mfa is given by @xmath42 where the self - energy @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44\\exp(i\\vec k\\cdot\\vec d ) \\label { mfa2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath45 is the vector from the position @xmath36 to @xmath40 .",

    "( [ mfa3 ] ) is sizable only in areas close to the two dirac points .",
    "figure 3 shows the typical behaviors of the two functions    @xmath52    defined in the two valleys @xmath13 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "3 is obtained by the self - consistent solution to the ocs without external fields .",
    "the functions are nonvanishing only within @xmath54 with @xmath32 as the lattice constant .",
    "then , the @xmath21 integration in eq .",
    "( [ mfa3 ] ) can be confined to two valleys .",
    "since the range of the exchange interaction @xmath47 is finite due to the electronic charge - fluctuation screening , the phase @xmath55 in the factor @xmath56 can be safely approximated as @xmath57 .",

    ", we need to consider only the low energy quasiparticles with momenta close to the dirac points . then by expanding the self - energy with respect to the momentum @xmath21 in the two valleys and taking only the leading terms ,",
    "we get @xmath67 with @xmath68    physically , the imaginary part @xmath59 is proportional to a bond current .",
    "all the bond currents in the lattice constitute to the current loops .",
    "the existence of the bond currents breaks the time - reversal symmetry . in fig .",
    "4 , we draw out some of the bond currents on the same sublattice connected to a given site @xmath35 . clearly , the total current density at site @xmath35 is zero .",
    "next , we consider the quantity @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "for example , consider the case for @xmath23 = a@xmath7 and @xmath71 = b@xmath7 on the top layer .",
    "suppose the quantity is not vanishing . as shown in fig .",
    "5 , the bond currents all with a fixed bond length @xmath72 result in three kinds of hexagon current loops with positive , negative , and zero fluxes [ supposing the flux is positive ( negative ) for counterclockwise ( clockwise ) current loop ] , respectively . from the particle conservation law ,",
    "the current along the boundary between the positive and the negative flux hexagons is two times of that along the boundary between the zero and the positive / negative flux ones .",
    "the hexagon current loops imply not only the breaking of time - reversal symmetry but also the breaking of translational invariance ( homogeneity ) .",
    "the breaking of translational invariance to a low symmetry state requires the relevant interaction strong enough .",
    "note that there is no a common periodicity for the two kinds of hexagon current loops with different side length @xmath73 in the lattice .",
    "the coexistence of the different hexagon current loops corresponds to completely an inhomogeneous system and can not be realized for the electrons with finite - range interactions .",
    "the most favorable case is the smallest hexagon loops may exist when the interaction between the nn a@xmath7 and b@xmath7 atoms is strong enough .",
    "the argument applies to all @xmath69 with @xmath70 . for",
    "weak to medium interactions , we here assume all the currents between the sites of different sublattices are negligible small . on the other hand , the off - diagonal averages @xmath74 with @xmath70 can be pure real quantities without breaking homogeneity of the system .",
    "the real quantities describe the electron hopping and renormalize the noninteracting hamiltonian .",
    "we here assume that such renormalization has already been included in @xmath75 , we therefore do not take into account these hopping processes more again .",
    "( in the presence of external electric or magnetic field , even if the renormalization depends on the field , we will neglect the field effect . )",
    "we suppose @xmath76 and @xmath77 that means the breaking of the layer inversion symmetry . for the homogeneous system at the cnp",
    ", we have @xmath78 . as a result ,",
    "the effective mfa hamiltonian @xmath79 is obtained by adding the diagonal matrix diag(@xmath80 ) to @xmath81 : @xmath82 note that the matrices @xmath79 and @xmath83 are related by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a @xmath86 matrix @xmath87 if @xmath88 is an eigenfunction of @xmath79 with eigenvalue @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , then @xmath91 is an eigenfunction of @xmath83 with the same eigenvalue .",
