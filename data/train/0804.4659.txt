    "spatial trapping of light in nonlinear media is a result of a balance between diffraction and the self - induced nonlinear index change @xcite . as the rate of diffraction is determined by the spatial scale of the light beam independently of its dimensionality the stability properties of the self - trapped beams critically depend on the particular model of the nonlinear response of the medium .",
    "commonly encountered in the context of nonlinear optics the , so called , kerr nonlinearity with nonlinear index change being proportional to light intensity leads to stable spatial solitons only in one transverse dimension . for two dimensional beams the same model does not permit stable beam localization .",
    "instead , it predicts either eventual diffraction or catastrophic collapse for input power below or above a certain threshold value , respectively @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to ensure the existence of stable self - localized beams in two dimensions different nonlinear response is necessary .",
    "it is known that the saturation of nonlinearity at high intensities is sufficient to prevent collapse and provide stabilization of finite beams ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , saturable nonlinearity can not stabilize complex localized structures such as vortex beams which are prone to azimuthal instability  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently that stabilization of localized waves is greatly enhanced in the nonlocal nonlinear media .",
    "in such media nonlinear response in a particular spatial location is typically determined by the wave intensity in a certain neighborhood of this location .",
    "nonlocality often results from certain transport processes such as atomic diffusion  @xcite , ballistic transport of hot atoms or molecules  @xcite or heat transfer  @xcite",
    ". it can be also a signature of a long - range interparticle interaction such as in nematic liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "spatially nonlocal response is also naturally present in atomic condensates where it describes a noncontact bosonic interaction  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of beam propagation in nonlocal nonlinear media revealed a range of interesting features .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that nonlocality may affect modulational instability of plane waves  @xcite and prevent catastrophic collapse of finite beams  @xcite as well as stabilize complex one- and two - dimensional beams including vortices  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that nonlocal media can also support stable propagation of the rotating solitons , the so called azimuthons  @xcite .",
    "azimuthons have been originally proposed in the context of local nonlinear media  @xcite . they are azimuthally modulated beams with nontrivial phase structures exhibiting steady angular rotation upon propagation .",
    "they can be considered as azimuthally perturbed optical vortices , i.e. beams with singular phase structure  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies demonstrated both , stable and unstable evolution of azimuthons  @xcite . in the former case",
    "it has been shown that in a highly nonlocal regimes azimuthons undergo structural transformation resulting from the energetic coexistence of solitons of different symmetries .",
    "numerical and analytical studies revealed that the angular velocity of azimuthons is governed by two contributions .",

    "we consider various nonlocal models and show how they determine dynamical properties of azimuthons . in particular , we will show that both , rotational frequency and intensity profile of the azimuthons can be uniquely determined by analyzing eigenmodes of the linearized version of the corresponding nonlocal problem . the paper is organized as follows : in sec .
