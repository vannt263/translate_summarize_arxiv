    "the proposed new colliding - beam accelerators  designed to investigate nuclear matter at high temperatures and densities by accelerating highly charged heavy ions at fixed - target energies per nucleon up to @xmath1 tev  have motivated great interest during the last decade concerning possible new electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "when heavy ions collide at relativistic velocities , the lorentz - contracted electromagnetic fields in the space - time region near the collision are sufficiently intense to produce large numbers of electron - positron pairs , muon pairs , vector bosons , and possibly the yet - unconfirmed higgs boson .",
    "all these processes occur at nearly atomic distance scales @xcite .",
    "the phenomena involved are pervasive , impinging upon atomic , nuclear , and particle physics .",
    "the electromagnetic fields associated with these collisions are intense as they are proportional to the lorentz factor @xmath2 , which is approximately the beam kinetic - energy in units of gev per nucleon , and the charge of the ion @xmath3 .",
    "these parameters , together with the impact parameter , @xmath4 , determine the fields available in a collision .",
    "the feature of electromagnetic particle production by heavy ions , which piqued early studies , is the @xmath5 enhancement through the coherent action of all the constituent charges of the colliding partners .",
    "the pulsed fields are strongly time dependent with a width of @xmath6 and , thus , contain large fourier components which give rise to relatively large particle production probabilities .",
    "coherent particle production is most clearly distinguished in peripheral collisions .",
    "one of the most interesting of these processes , from the perspective of both fundamental and practical importance , is the sparking of the vacuum to produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "much study has been devoted to the problem of electron - positron pair production during recent years in anticipation of new experimental opportunities at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , currently under construction at brookhaven national laboratory , as the immense predicted fluxes of electrons can not be ignored in detector or accelerator design .",
    "this facility will provide extremely relativistic colliding beams of fully stripped ions as heavy as gold , fully exposing the large charge of the atomic nucleus .",
    "the primary physics goal of the rhic project is the creation and study of a so - called quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this unique form of matter is expected to be formed in the central , or near - central , collisions of heavy ions at extreme relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic conditions attained in these central collisions are expected to be such that the constituent quarks and gluons of baryons and mesons become deconfined in a new and short - lived plasma state .",
    "electron- and muon - pair production from hadronic interactions have been widely discussed as a possible tool to help probe the formation and the decay of the quark - gluon plasma phase of matter @xcite . in the conditions of such central collisions , lepton - hadron final - state interactions are usually small , and , hence",
    ", the leptons carry direct information on the space - time region of creation .",
    "however , suggestions by several authors indicate that other sources of lepton pairs might possibly mask the leptonic signals originating from the plasma phase @xcite . electromagnetic production from the vacuum of single- and",
    "multiple - lepton pairs is a major contribution to this physical background @xcite and , therefore , must be understood in detail .",
    "in addition , two very abundant electromagnetic processes constitute the primary limitation to the lifetime of stored beams at rhic .",
    "one is a nuclear decay following the electromagnetic excitation of the giant dipole resonance , and the second is the creation of an electron - positron pair accompanied by the capture of the electron in an atomic bound state of a participant heavy ion . both processes result in a change in the charge - to - mass ratio of the ion in the storage ring causing it to be deflected out of the beam .    from a fundamental perspective ,",
    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide an opportunity to study nonperturbative quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in an entirely new and continuously varying energy regime , using an interaction which is completely known due to the combination of very high collision energies and electric charges .",
    "the coherent , electromagnetic production of electron - positron pairs using heavy ions is fundamentally different from other production mechanisms using light particles at high energies , since in the former , the coupling constant is strongly enhanced due to the large charge .    nonetheless , perturbative methods are useful in studying the problem of lepton - pair production , and reliable lowest - order perturbative calculations have been used as input into design models for rhic @xcite .",
    "beginning with quantum - field theory , we derive a classical - field method based on feynman perturbation theory in the limit that the momentum transfer of the photons is much smaller than the momentum carried by the nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is manifestly true for the coherent production of particles through two - photon processes in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these lowest - order diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ figex ] ) , coupling lepton fields to classical electromagnetic fields , have been evaluated exactly using monte carlo @xcite and analytical techniques @xcite , and predict cross sections consistent with experiments for free electron - positron production performed by two independent groups using collisions of s + au @xcite and s + pt @xcite , respectively , at fixed - target energies of 200 a gev . furthermore , no indication of nonperturbative effects is observed in these experiments using the relatively light sulfur projectile .",
    "however , applying lowest - order perturbation theory to the production of electron - positron pairs with heavy ions at high energies and small impact parameters results in probabilities and cross sections which violate various theoretical bounds such as unitarity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore clear that low - order perturbative calculations alone are not adequate for smaller impact parameters at rhic energies , as higher - order damping effects must be included ( e.g.  the creation of multiple pairs @xcite ) .",
    "heavy ions have been used to produce electron - positron pairs in collisions of u + au at fixed - target energies of 0.96 a gev , and the observed cross sections are not in agreement with the low - order calculations performed at these energies @xcite .",
    "new experiments using a variety of targets are scheduled for november , 1994 @xcite using lead beams at fixed - target energies of 160 a gev , and for 1996 @xcite using gold beams at fixed - target energies of 12 a gev during which electron - pair multiplicities and other nonperturbative features of these collisions will be observed .",
    "the monte carlo method described in ref .",
    "@xcite for evaluating the two - photon feynman diagrams employs an analytic integration over the impact parameter and , thus , does not provide information on the impact - parameter dependence of the cross section . in this present work ,",
    "we generalize these techniques in order to calculate the impact - parameter dependence of the two - photon diagrams which has implications for the description of the electromagnetic background for hadronic interactions , the study of strong - field effects ( e.g.  pair multiplicities ) , and the study of the validity of the equivalent - photon approximation , as is discussed below .",
    "various possibilities for experimental study of the impact - parameter dependence for free electron- and/or muon - pair production are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    concerning certain classes of detectors designed for nuclear physics experiments at rhic",
    ", the total integrated cross section may not be the most relevant quantity for studies of the electromagnetic background .",
    "if the detector triggers on a limited range of small impact parameters , the pair production probability for these impact parameters would be more relevant @xcite .",
    "due to the nature of the electromagnetic interaction , the particle production process occurs over a large range of impact parameters .",
    "the larger impact parameters produce weaker , more perturbative , fields , but these impact parameters are favored by the geometrical weight factor in the cross - section integration .",
    "an integration over all impact parameters also includes contributions from impact parameters where the two nuclei would collide .",
    "the assumption that the nuclei continue on straight - line paths for these nonperipheral impact parameters is not accurate .",
    "thus , one would like to isolate the relatively small impact parameters which are still larger than the grazing impact parameter for the study of strong - field effects .",
    "recent progress has been made in understanding the nonperturbative nature of the production of multiple free electron - positron pairs @xcite . using the usual assumptions of the classical , strong nature of the electromagnetic field generated by the heavy ions and omitting the final state interactions among the produced leptons",
    ", one can express the probability for producing @xmath7pairs as a poisson distribution whose mean value is the probability for producing a single pair in lowest - order perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , the central ingredient needed for describing the multiplicity distribution of electron - positron pairs within this approximation is the impact - parameter dependence of the two - photon mechanism .",
    "historically , the two - photon process has been modeled through the equivalent - photon approximation , which takes advantage of the close relation between the interaction produced by a relativistic charged particle and those due to incident electromagnetic waves @xcite . in the equivalent - photon approximation ,",
    "the equivalent - photon flux associated with a relativistic charged particle is obtained via a fourier decomposition of the electromagnetic interaction @xcite .",
    "cross sections are obtained by folding the elementary , real two - photon cross section for the pair - production process with the equivalent - photon flux produced by each ion .",
    "the pair - production cross section is easier to compute using the equivalent - photon approximation than by calculating the two - photon diagram , and the results for the total cross section are reasonably accurate , provided the incident - particle lorentz factor @xmath2 is much greater than one , and that the energy transferred via the photon is much less than @xmath2 .",
    "however , details of the differential cross sections , spectra , and impact - parameter dependence differ , especially when complicated numerical cuts in the coordinates are applied in order to compare with experiments . among the shortcomings of this approximation",
    "is an undetermined parameter which corresponds to the minimum impact parameter or the maximum momentum transfer , which makes it difficult to get specific results . as such , the method loses applicability at impact parameters less than the compton wavelength of the lepton @xcite , which is the region of greatest interest for the study of nonperturbative effects .",
