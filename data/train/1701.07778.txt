    "the study of palindromes is a frequent topic and many diverse results may be found . in recent years",
    ", some of the papers deal with so - called _ rich _ words , or also words having _ palindromic defect @xmath8_. they are words that have the maximum number of palindromic factors .",
    "as noted by @xcite , a finite word @xmath0 can contains at most @xmath9 distinct palindromic factors with @xmath10 being the length of @xmath0 .",
    "the rich words are exactly those that attain this bound .",
    "it is known that on binary alphabet the set of rich words contains factors of sturmian words , factors of complementary symmetric rote words , factors of the period - doubling word , etc . , see @xcite .",
    "on multiliteral alphabet , the set of rich words contains for example factors of arnoux  rauzy words and factors of words coding symmetric interval exchange .",
    "rich words can be characterized using various properties , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the concept of rich words can also be generalized to respect so - called pseudopalindromes , see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on an unsolved question of computing the number of rich words of length @xmath1 over an alphabet with @xmath11 letters .",
    "this number is denoted @xmath4 .",
    "this question is investigated in @xcite , where j. vesti gives a recursive lower bound on the number of rich words of length @xmath1 , and an upper bound on the number of binary rich words .",
    "both these estimates seem to be very rough . in @xcite , c. guo , j. shallit and a.m. shur constructed for each @xmath1 a large set of rich words of length @xmath1 .",
    "their construction gives , currently , the best lower bound on the number of binary rich words , namely @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a polynomial and the constant @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , the best known upper bound is exponential . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "calculation performed recently by m. rubinchik provides the upper bound @xmath15 for some constant @xmath6 , see @xcite .",
    "our main result stated as theorem [ label_th_f ] shows that @xmath4 has a subexponential growth on any alphabet .",
    "more precisely , we prove @xmath16{r_n(q)}=1\\,.\\ ] ] in @xcite , shur calls languages with the above property small .",
    "our result is an argument in favor of a conjecture formulated in @xcite saying that for some infinitely growing function @xmath17 the following holds true @xmath18 .    to derive our result we consider a specific factorization of a rich word into distinct rich palindromes , here called ups - factorization ( unioccurrent palindromic suffix factorization ) , see definition [ factorization ] .",
    "let us mention that another palindromic factorizations have already been studied , see @xcite : minimal ( minimal number of palindromes ) , maximal ( every palindrome can not be extended on the given position ) and diverse ( all palindromes are distinct ) .",
    "note that only the minimal palindromic factorization has to exist for every word .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section [ notation ] recalls notation and known results . in section [ faktor ] we study a relevant property of ups - factorization .",
    "the last section is devoted to the proof of our main result .",
    "let us start with a couple of definitions : let @xmath19 be an alphabet of @xmath3 letters , where @xmath11 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 denotes the set of nonnegative integers ) .",
    "a finite sequence @xmath22 with @xmath23 is a _",
    "finite word_. its length is @xmath1 and is denoted @xmath24 . let @xmath25 denote the set of words of length @xmath1 .",
    "we define that @xmath26 contains just the empty word .",
    "it is clear that the size of @xmath25 is equal to @xmath27 .",
    "+ given @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 , we say that @xmath31 is a _ factor _ of @xmath32 if there exists @xmath33 such that @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . + a word @xmath40 is called a _ palindrome _ if @xmath41 .",
    "the empty word is considered to be a palindrome and a factor of any word .",
    "a word @xmath32 of length @xmath1 is called _ rich _ if @xmath32 has @xmath2 distinct palindromic factors .",
    "clearly , @xmath40 is rich if and only if its _ reversal _ @xmath42 is rich as well .",
    "+ any factor of a rich word is rich as well , see @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the language of rich words is factorial .",
    "in particular it means that @xmath43 for any @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the fekete s lemma implies existence of the limit of @xmath45{r_n(q)}$ ] and moreover @xmath16{r_n(q)}= \\inf \\left \\{\\sqrt[n]{r_n(q ) } \\colon",
    "n \\in \\mathbb{n } \\right\\}.\\ ] ] for a fixed @xmath46 , one can find the number of all rich words of length @xmath46 and obtain an upper bound on the limit .",
    "using computer rubinchik counted @xmath47 for @xmath48 , ( see the sequence a216264 in oeis ) . as @xmath49{r_{60}(2 ) } < 1.605 $ ] , he obtained the upper bound given in introduction .",
    "as shown in @xcite , any rich word @xmath32 over alphabet @xmath19 is richly prolongable , i.e. , there exist letters @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is also rich .",
    "thus a rich word is a factor of an arbitrarily long rich word .",
    "but the question whether two rich words can appear simultaneously as factors of a longer rich word may have negative answer .",
    "it means that the language of rich words is not recurrent .",
    "this fact makes enumeration of rich words hard .",
    "let us recall one important property of rich words ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition @xmath52 and proposition @xmath53 ) : the longest palindromic suffix of a rich word @xmath0 has exactly one occurrence in @xmath0 ( we say that the longest palindromic suffix of @xmath0 is _ unioccurrent _ in @xmath0 ) .",
    "it implies that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a palindrome which is not a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "since every factor of a rich word is a rich word as well , it follows that @xmath56 is a rich word and thus @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a palindrome which is not a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "obviously @xmath60 .",
    "we can repeat the process until @xmath61 is the empty word for some @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "we express these ideas by the following lemma :    [ lemma_a ] let @xmath0 be a rich word .",
    "there exist distinct non - empty palindromes @xmath64 such that @xmath65    [ factorization ] we define ups - factorization ( unioccurrent palindromic suffix factorization ) to be the factorization of a rich word @xmath0 into the form ( [ eqtn_001 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath66 in the factorization ( [ eqtn_001 ] ) are non - empty , it is clear that @xmath67 .",
    "from the fact that the palindromes @xmath66 in the factorization ( [ eqtn_001 ] ) are distinct we can derive a better upper bound for @xmath68 .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove the following theorem :    [ theorem_a ] there is a constant @xmath69 such that for any rich word @xmath0 of length @xmath1 the number of palindromes in the ups - factorization of @xmath70 satisfies @xmath71    before proving the theorem , we show two auxiliary lemmas :    [ lemma_b ] let @xmath72 such that @xmath73 the number @xmath68 of palindromes in the ups - factorization @xmath74 of any rich word @xmath0 with @xmath75 satisfies @xmath76    let @xmath77 be an infinite sequence of all non - empty palindromes over an alphabet @xmath19 with @xmath78 letters , where the palindromes are ordered in such a way that @xmath79 implies that @xmath80 . in consequence @xmath81",
    "are palindromes of length @xmath82 , @xmath83 are palindromes of length @xmath84 , etc . since @xmath85 are distinct non - empty palindromes we have @xmath86 .",
    "the number of palindromes of length @xmath33 over the alphabet @xmath19 with @xmath3 letters is equal to @xmath87 ( just consider that that the `` first half '' of a palindrome determines the second half ) .",
    "the number @xmath88 equals the length of a word concatenated from all palindromes of length less than or equal to @xmath89 . since @xmath90",
    ", it follows that the number of palindromes @xmath68 is less than or equal to the number of all palindromes of length at most @xmath89 ; this explains the inequality ( [ eqtn_004 ] ) .",
    "[ lemma_c ] let @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 such that @xmath94 .",
    "we have @xmath95    the sum of the first @xmath96 terms of a geometric series with the quotient @xmath97 is equal to @xmath98 .",
    "taking the derivative of this formula with respect to @xmath97 with @xmath93 we obtain : @xmath99 .",
    "it follows that the right inequality of ( [ eqtn_005 ] ) holds for all @xmath91 and @xmath93 .",
    "the condition @xmath94 implies that @xmath100 , which explains the left inequality of ( [ eqtn_005 ] ) .",
    "we can start the proof of theorem [ theorem_a ] :    let @xmath101 be a minimal nonnegative integer such that the inequality ( [ eqtn_003 ] ) in lemma [ lemma_b ] holds .",
    "it means that : @xmath102 where for the last inequality we exploited ( [ eqtn_005 ] ) with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath105 , then the condition @xmath106 is fulfilled ( it is the condition from lemma [ lemma_c ] ) for any @xmath107 . hence let us suppose that @xmath105 and @xmath107 . from ( [ eqtn_006 ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath108 since @xmath89 is such that the inequality ( [ eqtn_003 ] ) holds and @xmath109 for any @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we can write : @xmath112 we apply a logarithm on the previous inequality : @xmath113 an upper bound for the number of palindromes @xmath68 in ups - factorization follows from ( [ eqtn_004 ] ) , ( [ eqtn_007 ] ) , and ( [ eqtn_009 ] ) : @xmath114 the previous inequality supposes that @xmath105 and @xmath107 . if @xmath115 then we can easily derive from ( [ eqtn_003 ] ) that @xmath116 and consequently @xmath117 .",
    "thus the inequality @xmath118 holds as well for this case .",
    "since every rich word over an alphabet with the cardinality @xmath119 is also a rich word over the alphabet with the cardinality @xmath120 , the estimate ( [ eqtn_002 ] ) in theorem [ theorem_a ] holds if we set the constant @xmath6 as follows : @xmath121 .",
    "theorem  [ theorem_a ] implies that average length of a palindrome of ups - factorization of a rich word of length @xmath1 is @xmath122 .",
    "note that in @xcite it is shown that most of palindromic factors of a random word of length @xmath1 are of length close to @xmath123 .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that the set of rich words forms a small language , see theorem [ label_th_f ] .",
    "+ we present a recurrent inequality for @xmath4 . to ease our notation",
    "we omit the specification of the cardinality of alphabet and write @xmath124 instead of @xmath4 .    denote @xmath125 , where @xmath6 is the constant from theorem [ theorem_a ] and @xmath126 .",
    "[ label_th_d ] let @xmath126 , then @xmath127    given @xmath128 , let @xmath129 denote the number of rich words with ups - factorization @xmath130 , where @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "note that any palindrome @xmath66 is uniquely determined by its prefix of length @xmath133 ; obviously this prefix is rich .",
    "hence the number of words that appears in ups - factorization as @xmath66 can not be larger than @xmath134 .",
    "it follows that @xmath135 .",
    "the sum of this result over all possible @xmath68 ( see theorem [ theorem_a ] ) and @xmath136 completes the proof .",

    "we obtain : @xmath142 the sum @xmath143 can be interpreted as the number of ways how to distribute @xmath1 coins between @xmath68 people in such a way that everyone has at least one coin .",
    "that is why @xmath144 .",
