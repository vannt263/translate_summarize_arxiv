    "the scalar isoscalar potential plays an important role in the nucleon nucleon interaction providing an intermediate range attraction in all channels which is demanded by the data . in models of the nn interaction using one boson exchange ( obe ) this part of the interaction was accounted for by allowing the exchange of a `` @xmath3 '' particle in as early papers as @xcite .",
    "the exchange of a scalar particle has been a constant in other obe models @xcite . in some models",
    "a broad @xmath4 was advocated @xcite which has been used later on in more recent models @xcite .",
    "the particle data group @xcite refers to the lightest scalar meson as @xmath5 or @xmath3 .",
    "the nature of this particle , and even its mere existence , has been a source of controversy @xcite , but in recent years a strong convergence towards the idea that the @xmath3 is not a genuine meson state made up from a constituent @xmath6 pair has been witnessed @xcite .",
    "this idea has obtained further support from unitarized chiral perturbation theory where the @xmath3 appears as a dynamically generated resonance from the @xmath7 interaction @xcite .",
    "other models that start from a seed of @xmath6 , but couple this state to meson meson components in a unitary approach , converge to the same idea by showing that the meson cloud is essential in building up the low lying scalar resonances @xcite .",
    "the picture of the @xmath3 as a dynamically generated resonance called for a new interpretation of the @xmath3 exchange in the nn interaction and this work was performed in @xcite . in this work",
    "the traditional @xmath3 exchange was substituted by the exchange of two interacting mesons within the chiral unitary framework of @xcite , and an intermediate attraction was found together with a repulsion at short distances , which makes the picture qualitatively different from the ordinary , always attractive , @xmath3 exchange .",
    "the exchange of two interacting pions , although nonperturbative , was considered in @xcite and shown to reproduce well the nn peripheral partial waves with @xmath8 .",
    "a recent work studying the isoscalar contact @xmath9 interactions retakes the unitarization of the @xmath7 amplitude in the two pion exchange using the omnes representation @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite was complemented in @xcite , where in addition to the interacting two pion exchange , the contribution of the uncorrelated two pion exchange and the repulsive contribution of the @xmath2 exchange were considered , leading altogether to a good reproduction of the empirical scalar isoscalar interaction of @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend this to the strange sector evaluating the @xmath0 scalar isoscalar interaction .",
    "empirical evaluations of the yn scalar isoscalar interaction are done in several works allowing the exchange of a scalar meson and making fits to data . as quoted above",
    ", the nijmegen group makes use of the exchange of a heavy scalar meson and there are different fits available in the literature @xcite . a recent work of the group shows an interesting feature which is the improvement of the results by using a form factor incorporating a zero @xcite , which leads to qualitative features of the scalar meson exchange similar to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the exchange of various scalar mesons is also considered in @xcite as well as correlated two pion exchange , which however is treated phenomenologically . another approach to the problem is the chiral quark model in which the @xmath10 and a @xmath3 are allowed to be exchanged between constituent quarks @xcite . in the same line , in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite a su(3 ) nonet of scalar mesons is exchanged between the quarks .",
    "the closest work to our approach is the theoretical work of @xcite , following the line of the juelich model @xcite , where the uncorrelated and correlated two pion exchange are considered explicitly .",
    "the approach to the correlated two pion ( and two kaon ) exchange is done rather differently by evaluating theoretically the @xmath11 amplitudes and using then unitarity and dispersion relations to relate these amplitudes to the correlated two meson exchange contribution to the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "our approach evaluates directly the correlated two pion exchange by explicitly using the chiral unitary approach to deal with the pion pion interaction and using appropriate triangle diagrams to account for the coupling of the two pions to the baryons .",
    "the success of this approach providing the scalar isoscalar @xmath9 interaction provides solid grounds to extend these ideas to the case of the @xmath0 interaction , which we present in this work .",
    "we follow closely ref .  @xcite and consider the correlated two - meson exchange between baryons . in order to evaluate these diagrams we use the lowest order chiral lagrangeans @xmath13 } + \\frac{1}{12f_\\pi^2 } { { \\rm{tr } } \\ !",

    "the mass matrix of the mesons octet is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "from there , one obtains the different pion - pion ( or @xmath18 ) lowest order amplitudes , which can be found in @xcite and the @xmath19 vertices which for convenience we show in the appendix .",
    "the isoscalar amplitudes , which contain only @xmath20-wave , have been obtained by employing lagrangean @xmath21 in @xcite .",
    "the lowest order , tree level , amplitudes of meson - meson scattering can be written as @xmath22 where the @xmath23 on the superscript stands for the leading order amplitude of meson - meson scattering and we have employed the convenient unitary normalization and the isospin phase convention ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4],[eq : ak],[eq : apk ] ) we have separated the lowest order interaction into a part which provides the on - shell contribution and another term ( the one with @xmath27 ) which contributes only for off - shell mesons .        as shown in @xcite , the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitudes",
    "does not contribute to our calculation .",
    "in fact , for the meson - meson loops , this contribution is absorbed into the physical mass and the coupling .",
    "as for the coupling to the baryons , there is a cancellation of the off - shell part of the meson - meson amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4],[eq : ak],[eq : apk ] ) with the diagrams of the type of fig .",
