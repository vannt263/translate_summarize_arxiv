    "the system is rewritten as a first order system in time and the classical runge - kutta 4 scheme is used to integrate in time .",
    "to perform reliable numerical computations it is of importance to know the number of grid points per surface wavelength needed to obtain a certain accuracy in an approximate solution . in this section we study surface waves in materials with varying @xmath26",
    "we are interested in the performance of schemes using sbp operators of different orders to discretize ( [ eq : e1 ] ) - ( [ eq : e2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical study is performed as follows . for a given value of @xmath26",
    "we determine the number of grid points , @xmath69 , per surface wavelength needed to achieve a relative max error of at most @xmath45 after having propagated for 10 periods in time . as",
    "the number of grid points per surface wavelength needed for accuracy is proportional to @xmath70 where @xmath1 is the order of accuracy of the method , high order of accuracy is expected to become more influential as @xmath26 decreases .",
    "the higher the order of the scheme the more computational effort is required . for this reason",
    "execution times are recorded .",
    "it is then possible to conclude how small @xmath26 must be to compensate for the higher complexity of higher order schemes .",
    "we use ( [ eq : e18 ] ) and ( [ eq : e7 ] ) to derive an analytic expression of a rayleigh surface wave .",
    "we are computing in real arithmetic , therefor we use the real part of the displacement field @xmath5 , @xmath71 here the phase velocity @xmath24 is given by ( [ eq : e19 ] ) .",

    "the period , @xmath78 , of the solution is then proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "we consider a domain which is periodic in the @xmath41 - direction . the computational domain is chosen to contain exactly one wavelength of the solution . at the boundary @xmath11 a traction free boundary condition is imposed .",

    "the numerical computations are made on a single intel xenon w3680 3.33 ghz processor .",
    "results for different values of @xmath26 are reported in table 2 .",
    "we see that for @xmath81 the schemes using 6th and 8th order sbp operators perform similarly whereas the scheme using 4th order operators need significantly more computational time to achieve a @xmath45 relative error , in particular for the case @xmath82 .",
    "the errors obtained with the 4th order method are of the same magnitude as those obtained in @xcite for the same values of @xmath26 . for @xmath83",
    "the 6th order scheme is clearly disadvantageous compared to the 8th order scheme , it uses more than 4 times the amount of time to get a relative error of maximum @xmath45 for @xmath26 in this interval . for @xmath84",
    "the required number of points per surface wavelength used by the 8th order scheme has increased very much above the value predicted by the classical theory and for such materials even higher order methods would be needed for an efficient numerical method .",
    "these computations verifies the theory of @xcite for schemes of higher accuracy than 4 and predicts how small @xmath32 must be for the different higher order methods to be more efficient when surface waves are present in simulations .",
    ".the leftmost column displays the value of @xmath26 and the period , @xmath78 , of the solution .",
    "the rest of the columns report the number of grid points per surface wavelength and the corresponding relative max errors , @xmath85 and execution times , @xmath86 for schemes using @xmath1-th order sbp operators . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      using the fact @xmath87 in the expression ( [ eq : e16 ] ) for @xmath88 we get @xmath89 hence , @xmath90 represents rayleigh surface waves with amplitude that decays exponentially in the @xmath37 - direction .",
    "the waves travel harmonically along the @xmath41 - axis with phase velocity @xmath91 note that @xmath92 and @xmath93 necessarily vanishes , otherwise the solutions would have an unbounded amplitude for increasing @xmath37 . in case of the root @xmath94 ( [ eq : e13 ] ) gives @xmath95 so that @xmath96 the relation ( [ eq : e7 ] ) then gives @xmath97 .",
    "that is , the root @xmath94 corresponds to a displacement field that vanishes everywhere .",
    "the truncation errors arising from a discretization of the traction free boundary condition can be thought of as a perturbation of the homogeneous boundary condition by introducing non - zero boundary forcing functions @xmath98 in ( [ eq : e2 ] ) and ( [ eq : e7 ] ) .",
    "typically @xmath99 and @xmath100 depends on derivatives of the continuous solution and the grid size .",
    "we again consider a solution of the form ( [ eq : e12 ] ) with @xmath101 , @xmath102 inserting this solution into the now inhomogeneous boundary conditions ( [ eq : e8 ] ) we get after some algebra , @xmath103 where @xmath104 . the determinant of this system is @xmath105 defined by ( [ eq : e16 ] ) .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : e21 ] ) - ( [ eq : e22 ] ) becomes singular exactly at the roots of @xmath105 . eliminating @xmath106 from ( [ eq : e22 ] ) and inserting it into ( [ eq : e21 ] ) gives , @xmath107 let the grid size be @xmath62 .",
    "discretizing ( [ eq : e2 ] ) with a second order accurate method the principal part of the truncation errors becomes @xmath108 by ( [ eq : e7 ] ) , @xmath109 using ( [ eq : e20 ] ) the boundary forcing functions becomes , @xmath110 since the right - hand side of ( [ eq : e21 ] ) is proportional to @xmath111 while the right - hand side of ( [ eq : e22 ] ) is independent of @xmath2 , for @xmath29 the main effect comes form @xmath99 . to simplify we therefor assume that @xmath112 . using ( [ eq : e21 ] ) with @xmath112 we eliminate @xmath113 from @xmath99 , @xmath114 the solution formula ( [ eq : e23 ] )",
    "can then be written in the form of an eigenvalue problem @xmath115 where @xmath116 this eigenvalue problem arises as a consequence of introducing truncation errors in a discretization of the traction free boundary condition .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath117 of this problem determines the phase velocities of surface waves in a numerical solution of ( [ eq : e1 ] ) - ( [ eq : e2 ] ) .",
    "the phase velocity of the rayleigh surface wave was determined by the roots @xmath118 of the function @xmath105 .",
    "we now investigate how sensitive the difference @xmath119 is to truncation errors .",
