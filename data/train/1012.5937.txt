    "transport phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and are an interesting physical problem .",
    "as the thermal noise becomes increasingly important for the dynamics at shorter length scales , the control and the theoretical treatment of the transport generally becomes more complicated .",
    "brownian motors do , however , take advantage of these random fluctuations , as they channel them into useful energy in the absence of bias forces  @xcite .",
    "this makes them interesting from the point of view of statistical physics , and they have been proposed as the basis of a large number of transport phenomena in biological structures  .",
    "brownian particles  @xcite in a periodic potential can be subjected to directed transport provided that two requirements are fulfilled : ( i ) the system has to possess an asymmetry , in accordance with the curie principle  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the trapping potentials have to present at least a spatial or spatio - temporal asymmetry ; ( ii ) the system has to be out of thermal equilibrium , in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the potentials , a friction force is usually present , the combination of the two localising the particles close to the potential minima , along with a diffusive force that is the source of the brownian motion .",
    "this diffusive force is often treated by letting the particles interact with a heat bath of temperature @xmath0 . the required asymmetry is usually included in the potential , _",
    "e.g. _ , as is the case for sawtooth potentials . to satisfy the second requirement stated above",
    ", the equilibrium between the particles and the heat bath has to be broken for drifts to be induced .",
    "this is usually done by non - adiabatically changing a parameter of the potential , _",
    "e.g. _ , the spatial phase in a rocked ratchet or the potential depth in a flashing ratchet , in a time - periodic fashion  @xcite .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the case where the particles can be found in different states , each with its own characteristic static potential , and where it is the state that evolves dynamically .    as an alternative to an asymmetric potential ,",
    "it is possible to achieved a biased drift for a multi - state particle using symmetrical potentials that are properly shifted between the states ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) . directed transport is then achieved through a combination of the shift of the potentials and inequalities in the rates of change of the states , resulting in a combined spatio - temporal asymmetry . to understand the processes involved",
    ", it can be convenient to consider this change of state as a transfer from one potential to another .",
    "such a brownian motor , where the asymmetry is given by a combination of a non - zero relative spatial phase and unequal transfer rates between only two symmetric , periodic potentials , has been demonstrated both numerically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , including with real - time control of the drift  @xcite .",
    "the original idea of using two phase - shifted symmetric potentials  @xcite ( along with its implementation  @xcite ) was based on laser - cooled atoms interacting with two optical lattices , created from the interference of laser beams  @xcite . as such",
    ", it was assumed that the asymmetry coming from unequal transfer rates between the two phase - shifted optical lattices , as occurs `` naturally '' in the system , was the asymmetry driving the brownian motor  @xcite .",
    "however , this is far from the only asymmetry present in the system . as the frequency and irradiance of the lasers making each optical lattice",
    "can be adjusted independently , inequalities between the potentials depths , the diffusion , and the friction are usually present and can be modified by varying these parameters .    from a more general point of view , this two - state brownian motor is a complex system , as the symmetry can be broken by any inequality between the two potentials , in combination with a relative spatial phase shift .",
    "that is , instead of unequal transfer rates , inequalities in the equilibrium temperature , the potential depth , or the friction could be used .",
    "these multiple ways of breaking the symmetry have not yet been investigated . moreover , in the original system , the transfers ( or changes of state ) are random , as they originate from spontaneous emission .",
    "this adds a source of randomness to the system , in addition to the brownian motion of the particles .",
    "we thus investigate below the role of these two sources of fluctuations and of the different kinds of asymmetries using numerical simulations .",
    "the system considered consists of a brownian particle interacting with either of two symmetric potentials , @xmath1 , \\nonumber\\\\   u_\\mathrm{2 } & = & \\frac{a_2}{2}\\left[1-\\cos{(kx + \\varphi)}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are the potential depths , @xmath3 is the wave number and @xmath4 the relative spatial phase of the potentials .",
    "we hereafter scale length such that @xmath5 .",
    "the particle will be transferred between the states ( the potentials ) with transfer rates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the lifetimes of the potentials , and is submitted to state - dependent friction , @xmath9 , and diffusive , @xmath10 , forces .",
    "this can be summed up in the langevin equation of motion  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath10 is a gaussian white noise satisfying the relations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , using a system of units where the mass of the brownian particle @xmath14 and boltzmann s constant @xmath15 .",
    "the index @xmath16 is either a random variable or changes at fixed times , with a rate of change set by the transfer rates mentioned above . when it is random , we consider the change of state as being a source of noise , as it leads to non - deterministic , noisy dynamics , in addition to @xmath10 which we term thermal noise .    the numerical integration of ( [ eq : langevin ] )",
    "is done with the bbk method  @xcite .",
    "we use time steps of size 0.01 , random initial positions and velocities , and run the simulations for 1000 or 2000 particles for about 40000 time steps .",
    "the relative magnitude of the parameters are chosen to achieve a brownian motor and , more specifically , to mimic the experimental system used in  @xcite .",
    "this means that the diffusive force should be large enough to clearly influence the dynamics , while small enough for the trapping potential to be relevant . as a default setting , we take @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( the choice of the latter is explained in section  [ sec : rates ] ) .",
    "this gives a potential depth that is four times larger than the thermal energy , @xmath20 , such that the particles are generally localised close to the potential minima but occasionally diffuse to neighbouring wells .",
    "a schematic illustration of the distribution of a brownian particle in these conditions is shown in figure  [ mod ] ,    , and a position spread , @xmath21 , dependent on the temperature @xmath0 and potential depth @xmath22 .",
    "even though the thermal energy is less than the potential depth , the spread of the distribution will lead to a diffusion in the potential , indicated with thick horizontal arrows in the figure.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    with the width of the distribution characterised by the root - mean - square position ( or standard deviation ) @xmath23 ( the position is to be understood as taken modulo @xmath24 , with @xmath25 denoting an ensemble average ) .",
    "the simulations are done for moderate friction , with default values of @xmath26 , such that the system is not overdamped , in contrast to most other investigations of brownian motor systems .",
    "the equilibrium properties are similar for both underdamped and overdamped systems , but the route to equilibrium differs significantly .",
    "this can be illustrated by considering a moderately damped particle starting at the slope of the potential . with time",
    ", the position and velocity spread will increase toward the equilibrium values , see figure  [ osc ] .     and",

    "no such oscillations take place , as any memory of earlier positions or velocities are quickly lost .",
    "the relation between the inter - potential transfer rates and the time to reach equilibrium crucially influences the distribution of positions at the instant of the transfer between the potentials . to study the effects of the oscillations before equilibrium is reached ( with friction @xmath32 ) , transfer rates @xmath33",
    "should be used , while for studies under equilibrium conditions @xmath34 be used , see figure  [ osc ] .",
    "the inter - potential transfer can be done in two ways : either at fixed times , analogous to the flashing ratchet model , or with random transfer times , adding another source of noise to the brownian system .",
    "the difference in the resulting dynamics will be investigated and discussed later in this paper .",
    "when the transfer times are relatively short compared to the time required to reach equilibrium in a given state ( figure  [ osc ] ) , the actual kinetic temperature of the particles in state @xmath35 will be greater than the equilibrium temperature @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , when we discuss the equilibrium properties in this case , we mean the equilibrium that would be reached in absence of the fast transfers , not the steady - state properties of the system .",
    "a necessary condition for directed transport is for the two potentials to be out of phase ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 an integer ) , but this is not sufficient to completely break the symmetry of the system .",
    "indeed , it was shown that no drift can be induced if such a system is overdamped  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , unequal transfer rates ( @xmath39 ) will result in directed transport , as shown with both simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite . in both these cases , the times at which the particle changes state are random .",
    "we show in figure  [ v_phi ] the dependence of the average transport velocity on the relative spatial phase for the model described above with @xmath40 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we point out that it is this case ( unequal transfer rates and random transfer times ) that was assumed to most closely resemble the experimental implementation with cold caesium atoms  @xcite , and was thus the only case studied theoretically in previous work  @xcite .",
    "to better understand the dynamics of the induced drifts , we set the relative spatial phase to the value that optimises the drift in the previous case , @xmath41 ( figure  [ v_phi ] ) , and now consider the effect of a varying asymmetry in the transfer rates .",
    "this is done below for both fixed and random transfer times .      by letting the transfers occur at fixed times ,",
    "a single source of randomness remains , that due to @xmath42 , and the system is somewhat simplified .",
    "the asymmetry is here scanned by varying @xmath43 from about @xmath44 ( highly asymmetric ) to @xmath45 ( symmetric ) , for three different values of @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting average velocity of the induced drifts can be seen in figure  [ t0fixt ] .",

    "the drifts are hence a direct consequence of the underdamped oscillations seen in figure  [ osc ] .",
    "these can induce drifts in two related ways , as illustrated in figure  [ bbb ] .",
    "consider a particle located close to the bottom of a well of potential 1 . as it is transferred to potential 2",
    ", it will end up on a slope , and start moving towards the minimum .",
    "if the particle moves past the minimum and up on the other slope before being transferred back , it can go beyond the point of the potential barrier of potential 1 . even if it comes back to the same well in potential 1 , the momentum gained can be enough to overcome the barrier in potential 1 .    in figure  [ t0fixt ] , a clear oscillatory pattern in the drift velocity s dependence on @xmath43 is seen .",
    "the oscillations have the same periodicity as in figure  [ osc ] , and their amplitude follows the same decaying envelope . for @xmath49 ,",
    "four peaks in the drift velocity can be seen , all in the same direction . for smaller @xmath45 , velocity peaks in the other direction",
    "can be seen , since the pre - equilibrium oscillations are now large enough to matter in potential 1 , and the average drift hence gets a complex dependence on the oscillations in both potentials .",
    "these drifts are a consequence of the finite damping and this scheme would hence not work in an overdamped case  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , clear similarities with the overdamped flashing and rocked ratchets can be seen , where large increases in the diffusion and the drift have been reported for certain resonances in the flashing rates  @xcite . for an asymmetry built on unequal transfer rates with deterministic transfer times",
    ", this works by matching transfer times and oscillation frequencies . in the deterministic limit , as the position spread of the particles",
    "is small , unidirectional drifts can thus be achieved .",
    "this situation is similar to a conventional internal combustion engine , where the timing of the ignition with the position of the piston is crucial , and as such the system does not correspond _ per se _ to a brownian motor .      here",

    "that is , the drifts are induced due to asymmetries in position or velocity space rather than by transfers at deterministic positions . in other words , since the transfer times are now a distribution rather than specific times , there is an uneven competition between processes that lead to diffusion in both directions .",
    "the similarity to conventional engines is lost and the behaviour is that of a `` true '' brownian motor . note that similar results are achieved both with and without the thermal noise , and that the equilibrium noise slows down the drifts rather than enhance them .",
    "however , random transfer times eliminate the need for a precise timing of the transfers .",
    "since it is the noise from the random transfers that is rectified , rather than the thermal noise , drifts can be induced for particles that are initially at rest .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the flashing ratchet , where the drift comes from an enhancement of the thermal noise . for a flashing ratchet",
    ", zero velocity corresponds to an absorbing state for @xmath50 , even if random flashing would be used .    since the equilibrium states are equal , the drifts are a consequence of the finite damping , as was also the case for fixed transfer times , and no drifts would be induced if the motion became overdamped  @xcite .",
    "we will now explore the possibility of inducing drifts with equal transfer rates but unequal equilibrium properties in the two states .",
    "we now consider induced drifts with equal transfer rates , @xmath53 , by introducing inequalities in the equilibrium states .",
    "the equilibrium states have zero average velocity and an average position centred in the wells , see figures  [ mod ] and [ osc ] .",
    "therefore , no resonances in the timing of the transfer can be found after the equilibrium has been reached .",
    "the equilibrium states are characterised by the widths of the velocity and position distributions in each well . in our model , these depend on the temperatures and the potential depths of the two states .",
    "we now investigate the effects of asymmetries in these parameters .",
    "the temperature determines the width of the equilibrium distribution of both the velocity and position within a well . in potentials of equal depth",
    ", different temperatures thus result in differences between the distributions in the two potentials .",
    "this , together with a relative spatial phase , breaks the symmetry and can hence induce drifts .    to demonstrate this ,",
    "@xmath54 is varied for fixed @xmath55 , in otherwise identical potentials .",

    "@xmath54 is varied.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    slightly higher drift velocities for deterministic transfer times are obtained .",
    "this is expected since all transfers occur when the two unequal equilibrium states have been reached for the case of deterministic transfers , while for random times a few transfers occur before equilibrium has been reached , which is on average unfavourable .",
    "the symmetry breaking can here be illustrated by considering the equilibrium distributions in the two potentials , see figure  [ tvar_mod ] . just before a transfer",
    ", the position distribution will be centred around a minimum in potential 1 with a certain spread .",
    "if the relative spatial phase is non - zero and less than @xmath57 , the position of a minimum in potential 1 is located in between a minimum and a maximum of potential 2 , see figure  [ tvar_mod ] .",
    "if the spread is sufficiently small , the particle will , with a probability close to unity , end up after the transfer on the slope pointing toward the closest minimum in potential 2 .",
    "however , if the spread is large enough , there is a finite probability to end up on the slope of the neighbouring minimum , leading to a diffusion of the particles .",
    "if the distributions in the two potentials have unequal spreads , the increased diffusion will be biased in one direction . to further investigate the mechanism of this biased diffusion , we define the difference between the probability of ending up in a neighbouring minimum , @xmath58 , for the two transitions as @xmath59 the value of @xmath60 can be extracted from the simulations by keeping track of the positions at which the transfers occur .        if @xmath60 is plotted for the same asymmetries as in figure  [ tvar ] , the same basic dependency is recreated , see figure  [ dg ] .",
    "a small deviation is visible for large temperatures .",
    "this could either be due the states having different velocity distributions or , since the finite damping allows for multi - well flights , a difference in the average flight length in each direction .",
