    "the galactic center is an object with a complicated signature in the x - rays . as @xcite show ,",
    "not only does the gc show multi - temperature components in the x - ray spectra , these components also vary quite dramatically spatially over the field - of - view of chandra , which is about half as large as that of xmm - newton . the low temperature component as measured by @xcite typically has values of @xmath43  @xmath44  kev , while the high temperature component can be as hot as @xmath45 ",
    "@xmath46  kev .",
    "the spatial variations in the elemental abundances of si , s , ar and ca are reported to be as high as a factor 2 or 3 , with only fe having a reasonable homogeneous distribution .",
    "our integrated spectrum of the entire inner 14 of the gc therefore will be a superposition of all these components , complicating our analysis significantly .",
    "restricting our modelling to the cleaner parts of the spectrum , 2.86.0 kev , we could find a reasonable fit using a single - temperature vvapec component with the elemental lines added manually as gaussians , and a folded powerlaw to account for non - thermal emission .",
    "no satisfactory two - temperature fits were found for temperatures in the range given by @xcite , even when extending the energy range of our analysis0.5% , see sec .  5 of  @xcite for details ) . when adding such large errors , the vvapec temperatures become consistent with previous works ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the abundances of s , ar , ca and k are 0.8 - 1.2 , 1.2 - 1.8 , 1.6 - 2.4 and 0.3 - 3.4  solar values at 68% level , respectively , in full accordance with  @xcite .",
    "we did not consider more than two temperature components , because it introduces too many degeneracies .",
    "as mentioned , the emission lines from heavy ions are added by hand .",
    "we start with the strongest lines known ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) , and work our way down so long as the fit requires it .",
    "as mentioned , the line detected at 3.539  kev might be influenced by the ar  xvii complex at 3.685  kev and the k  xviii lines at 3.515 and 3.47  kev . to explain the 3.539  kev line with ar  xvii , the width of this line should be much larger ( 95  130  ev ) than what can be expected from the instrumental response based on simulations of this ar complex .",
    "in addition , the flux in this ar  xvii complex would be higher than that of the same ion at 3.13  kev , which should not be possible based on the atomic data in table  [ tab : lines ] .    for the k  xviii lines , it is unfortunately not possible to constrain their contribution to the 3.539  kev line in the same way as for ar  xvii , since we do not have other , stronger , detected lines of the same ion in our spectrum . in this case",
    ", one may attempt to predict the ratio of k  xviii flux to the fluxes of ions of other elements such as ar  xvii , ca  xix , ca  xx , s  xvi , etc .",
    "based on temperature and relative abundances .",
    "since the gc emission consists of many different temperature and abundance components , it should be necessary to compute an estimate of the k  xviii flux for many different combinations of temperature and abundance .",
    "based on the flux of each of the different detected strong lines in turn and assuming solar abundance ( similarly to the analysis of section  4 of  @xcite ) , the predictions for the k  xvii flux can vary by more than an order of magnitude . even without considering deviations from solar abundance ( which may be as large as a factor 3  @xcite ) ,",
    "the detected flux in the 3.539  kev line falls within these predictions for a respectable fraction of these physically plausible scenarios .",
    "it is therefore not possible _ based on the gc data alone _ to exclude the astrophysical origin of this 3.539  kev line in the gc ."

    "<S> this result triggered significant interest as it seems consistent with a long - sought - for signal from dark matter decay  @xcite , annihilation  @xcite , de - excitation  @xcite or conversion in the magnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many particle physics models that predict such properties for the dark matter particle , have been put forward , including sterile neutrino , axion , axino , gravitino and many others , see for reviews e.g.  @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> if the interaction of dark matter particles is weak enough ( e.g.  much weaker than that of the standard model neutrino ) , they need not to be stable as their lifetime can exceed the age of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless huge amounts of dark matter particles can make the signal strong enough to be detectable even from such rare decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the omni - presence of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters opens the way to check the decaying dark matter hypothesis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decaying dark matter signal is proportional to the _ column density _ @xmath7  the integral along the line of sight of the dm density distribution ( unlike the case of annihilating dark matter , where the signal is proportional to @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the angular size of an object is larger than the field - of - view , the distance to the object drops out which means that distant objects can give fluxes comparable to those of nearby ones  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also does not decrease with the distance from the centres of objects as fast as e.g. in the case of annihilating dm where the expected signal is concentrated towards the centers of dm - dominated objects . </S>",
    "<S> this in principle allows one to check the dark matter origin of a signal by comparison between objects and/or by studying the angular dependence of the signal within one object , rather than trying to exclude all possible astrophysical explanations for each target  @xcite .        clearly , after years of systematic searches for this signal ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 in  @xcite ) any candidate line can be detected only at the edge of the possible sensitivity of the method . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to cross - check the signal one needs long - exposure data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even a factor 2 uncertainty in the expected signal ( which is impossible to avoid ) can result in the necessity to have significantly more statistics than in the initial data set in which the candidate signal was found .    </S>",
    "<S> so far the dm interpretation of the signal of  @xcite and  @xcite is consistent with the data : it has the correct scaling between the perseus cluster , andromeda and the upper bound from the non - detection in the blank sky data  @xcite , and between different subsamples of clusters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and lifetime of the dark matter particle that is implied by the dm interpretation of the results of  @xcite , is consistent with the results of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the signal has radial surface brightness profiles in the perseus cluster and andromeda  @xcite that are consistent with a dark matter distribution . although the significance of this result is not sufficient to confirm the hypothesis , they can be considered as successful sanity checks . </S>",
    "<S> more results are clearly needed to perform a convincing checking program as described above .    </S>",
    "<S> a classical target for dm searches is the centre of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> due to its proximity it is possible to concentrate on the very central part and therefore , even for decaying dm , one can expect a significant gain in the signal if the dm distribution in the milky way happens to be steeper than a cored profile . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic center ( gc ) region has been extensively studied by the xmm and several mega - seconds of raw exposure exist . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the gc region has strong x - ray emission as many complicated processes occur there  @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the x - ray emitting gas may contain several thermal components with different temperatures ; it may be more difficult to constrain the abundances of potassium and argon reliably than in the case of intercluster medium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the gc data alone would hardly provide a convincing detection of the dm signal , as even a relatively strong candidate line could be explained by astrophysical processes . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we pose a different question : _ are the observations of the galactic center consistent with the dark matter interpretation of the @xmath2  kev line of  @xcite ? _    the dm interpretation of the @xmath2  kev line in m31 and perseus provides a prediction of the _ minimal _ expected flux from the gc . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the non - detection of any signal in the off - center observations of the milky way halo ( the blank sky dataset of  @xcite ) provides the prediction of the _ maximal _ possible flux in the gc , given observational constraints on the dm distribution in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even with all the uncertainties on the dm content of the involved objects , the expected signal from the gc is bounded from both sides and provides a non - trivial check for the dm interpretation of the @xmath2  kev line </S>",
    "<S> .    we use xmm - newton observations of the central @xmath4 of the galactic center region with a total cleaned exposure of 1.4  msec . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectrum has a @xmath9 line - like excess at the expected energy . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous fitting of the gc , perseus and m31 provides a @xmath10 significant signal at the same position , with the detected fluxes being consistent with the dm interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the fluxes are also consistent with the non - observation of the signal in the blank - sky and m31 off - center datasets , if one assumes a steeper - than - cored dm profile ( for example , the nfw profile of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we removed the observations taken during the period mjd 5400054500 due to strong flaring activity of sgr a * ( see som , fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data reduction and preparation of the final spectra are similar to  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the x - ray emission from the inner part of the galactic center contains both thermal and non - thermal components  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we selected the @xmath13 lines from the set of astrophysical lines of  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting values for the main continuum components  the folded ` powerlaw ` index ( for the integrated point source contribution ) , the temperature of the ` vapec ` model ( @xmath158 kev ) , and the absorption column density  agree well with previous studies  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> it should be stressed that these @xmath17 error - bars are obtained with the ` xspec ` command ` error ` ( see * discussion * below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the excess is very close to the similar excesses recently observed in andromeda ( @xmath18  kev ) and perseus ( @xmath19  kev ) reported in  @xcite , and is less than @xmath20 away from the one described in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also performed combined fits of the gc dataset with those of m31 and perseus from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , the data reduction and modeling were performed very similarly , so we suffice with repeating that the inner part of m31 is covered by almost 1  msec of cleaned mos exposure , whereas a little over 500  ksec of clean mos exposure was available for perseus ( see  @xcite for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we first perform a joint fit to the galactic center and m31 , and subsequently to the galactic center , m31 and perseus . in both cases , we start with the best - fit models of each individual analysis without any lines at @xmath2  kev , and then add an additional gaussian to each model , allowing the energy to vary while keeping the same position between the models . the normalizations of this line for each dataset are allowed to vary independently . in this way , the addition of the line to the combination of galactic center , m31 and perseus gives 4 extra degrees of freedom , which brings the joint significance to @xmath21 .    </S>",

    "<S> the estimates are based on extrapolations , as there are no measurements of the dm distribution within the inner few kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between the gc and blank - sky projected dm densities is necessary , since these are different parts of the same halo . from comparing our gc signal with the blank - sky upper limit </S>",
    "<S> we see that _ this requires cuspy ( rather than cored ) density profile of the milky way_. fig .  </S>",

    "<S> m31 and milky way are expected to have similar distributions , providing another consistency check . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that in order to explain the signal from central @xmath4 and non - observation from m31 outskirts , the andromeda dm density profile should be cuspy , as predicted also for the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lifetime ] shows that indeed large projected dm mass ( i.e.  cuspy profile ) is preferred for m31 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally the perseus signal of  @xcite comes from the cluster outskirts where the hydrostatic mass  @xcite may be under - estimated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would only improve the consistency between the data sets .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of expected dm signal from gc vs.  blank - sky vs.  andromeda has been investigated in simulations  @xcite , where various realisation of the galactic dm halos were considered and high probability of finding observed flux ratios between gc and m31 and between gc and blank - sky upper limit was found .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - detection of the signal in stacked dsphs by  @xcite rules out the central values of the decay lifetime from  @xcite but is consistent with  @xcite in case of large project dm mass ( also preferred from comparison with other signals , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lifetime ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signal was not detected in stacked galaxy spectra  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a novel method of  @xcite has pronounced systematic effects ( see appendix  b of  @xcite ) and is the least sensitive exactly at energies @xmath32  kev . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite used a stacked dataset of nearby galaxies from  @xcite and showed that systematic effects and uncertainty in dark matter distributions  @xcite lead to the bound @xmath33  sec , consistent with our findings . </S>",
    "<S> other bounds on decaying dark matter in the @xmath34  kev energy range ( see  @xcite and references therein ) are also consistent with our detections for lifetimes that we discuss in this paper .    as mentioned in the * results * , there is a degeneracy between the width of the ar  xvii complex around @xmath24  kev and the normalization of the line in question . </S>",
    "<S> if we allow the width of the ar  xvii line to vary freely we can decrease the significance of the line at @xmath25  kev to about @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case the width of the ` gaussian ` at @xmath24  kev should be @xmath35  ev , which is significantly larger than we obtain when simulating a complex of four ar  xvii lines . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in this case the total flux of the line at @xmath24  kev becomes _ higher _ than the fluxes in the lines at @xmath36 and @xmath37 in contradiction with the atomic data ( som , table  ii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to decrease the significance of the line at @xmath25 is to assume the presence of a potassium ion ( k  xviii ) with a line at @xmath38  kev and a smaller line at @xmath39  kev . if one considers the abundance of potassium as a completely free parameter ( c.f .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , one can find an acceptable fit of the xmm gc data without an additional line at @xmath25  kev . </S>",
    "<S> as described in appendix b , due to the complicated internal temperature and abundance structures it is not possible to reliably constrain the overall potassium abundance of the gc to a degree that rules out the k  xviii origin of the @xmath25  kev line _ in this dataset . </S>",
    "<S> _    however , if we are to explain the presence of this line in the spectra by the presence of k  xviii , we have to build a model that consistently explains the fluxes in this line in different astronomical environments : in galaxy clusters ( in particular perseus ) at all off - center distances from the central regions  @xcite to the cluster outskirts up to the virial radius  @xcite ; in the central part of m31 ; and in the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we need to explain that this line is not observed  and therefore that this transition _ should not _ be excited  in the outskirts of the milky way and of m31  @xcite . such a consistent model does not look convincing . in particular , in m31 spectrum </S>",
    "<S> there are no strong astrophysical lines in @xmath40  kev range  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the powerlaw continuum is well determined by fitting the data over a wider range of energies ( from 2 to 8 kev ) and allows a clear detection of the line at @xmath41  kev with @xmath42  @xcite , which is also the largest line - like feature in the entire 34  kev range . </S>",
    "<S> were this signal in m31 due to k  xviii , there should be plenty of stronger emission lines present . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the authors of  @xcite conclude that strongly super - solar abundances of k  xviii are required to explain the observed excess of this line in their stacked cluster analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> _ in conclusion _ , although it is hard to exclude completely an astrophysical origin of the @xmath25  kev line in the gc ( due to the complicated nature of this object ) , the detection of this line in this object is an essential cross - check for the dm interpretation of the signal observed in perseus and m31  @xcite and in the stacked spectra of galaxy clusters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a non - detection in the gc or a detection with high flux would have immediately ruled out this interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> as it is , the gc data rather supports dm interpretation as the line is not only observed at the same energy , but also its flux is consistent with the expectations about the dm distributions .    to settle this question , measurements with higher spectral resolution , </S>",
    "<S> an independent measurement of the relative abundances of elements in the gc region , and analyses of additional deep exposure datasets of dm - dominated objects are needed  @xcite with astro - h  @xcite or future mision , athena  @xcite .    </S>",
