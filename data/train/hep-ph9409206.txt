    "there are general reasons for the interest in the possibility of cp violation in the scalar sector .",
    "cp violation is a necessary ingredient for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "it is believed that cp violation in the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa matrix is not large enough to explain that asymmetry @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated @xcite that the scalar sector might provide the missing cp violation .",
    "there have been studies of possible signatures of cp violation in the scalar sector .",
    "it has been remarked @xcite that the simultaneous presence of the three couplings @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are three neutral scalar fields in any model , implies cp violation .",
    "similarly , the simultaneous presence of the three couplings @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , represents cp violation .",
    "this is because the c quantum number of the @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "another work @xcite has considered various cp - violating lagrangians including scalars , fermions , and vector bosons , and has suggested looking for cp violation in the decay mode @xmath19  occurring when , in the rest frame of the decaying neutral scalar @xmath20 , the momentum distribution of the @xmath21 is not the same as the momentum distribution of the @xmath22  or , in a similar fashion , in @xmath23 .",
    "the first of these cp - violating asymmetries has later been computed @xcite in the context of the two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "however , the decay mode @xmath19 is phase - space disfavored as compared to the simpler decay modes @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "other studies @xcite have concentrated on cp - violating phenomena originating in the interplay of scalars and fermions , in particular the effects of top - quark physics .",
    "the aim of this work is the computation of a cp - violating asymmetry in the two - higgs - doublet model without any fermions .",
    "the model has gauge symmetry su(2)@xmath26u(1 ) , which is spontaneously broken to the u(1 ) of electromagnetism by the vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the two higgs doublets .",
    "i look for cp violation involving solely the gauge interactions of the scalars . for simplicity ,",
    "i do not consider the presence of fermions , which presence would lead to extra sources of cp violation , both in the fermion sector , and in the interplay of the fermion and the scalar sectors .",
    "i also omit possible sources of cp violation in the cubic and quartic interactions of the physical scalars . those scalars are two charged particles @xmath27 , with mass @xmath28 , and three neutral particles @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with masses @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively",
    ". besides , the spectrum of the model includes the massive intermediate vector bosons @xmath32 and @xmath17 , with masses @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 gev respectively , and the massless photon . for a fairly large range of the masses of the scalars , either the two decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or the two decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "are kinematically allowed ( the neutral scalars may be numbered so that @xmath1 is the scalar for which one of these couples of decays is allowed ) . then ,",
    "the possibility of a cp - violating difference between the rate of one decay and the rate of its cp - conjugated decay exists .",
    "it is my purpose to calculate that difference .",
    "it has recently been observed @xcite that the two - higgs - doublet model has one and only one source of cp violation in the gauge interactions of the scalars .",
    "i describe it briefly .",
    "because the u(1 ) of electromagnetism is preserved in the symmetry breaking , we can , without loss of generality , choose a basis for the two scalar doublets in which only one of them , @xmath35 , has a vev @xmath36 , while the second one , @xmath37 , does not have a vev .",
    "the two doublets in that basis can be written @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the goldstone bosons , which become the longitudinal components of the @xmath21 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are linear combinations of the three neutral scalar fields @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , which are the eigenstates of mass . those linear combinations are given by an orthogonal matrix @xmath44 , @xmath45 without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath44 to have determinant @xmath46 .",
    "then , the following useful identities follow : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath49 .",
    "there is cp violation in the gauge interactions of the scalars @xcite if and only if @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are all different , and @xmath50 is non - zero .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 has in the two - higgs - doublet model a role analogous to the one of jarlskog s",
    "@xcite @xmath51 in the three - generation standard model .",
    "notice however that , here , there are in principle other sources of cp violation , in the cubic and quartic interactions of the scalars .",
    "i will neglect those extra sources of cp violation throughout this work .",
    "it is important to remark that , though @xmath0 represents cp violation in the mixing of the three neutral scalars , this source of cp violation has nothing to do with the fermions and with the identification of , say , @xmath41 and @xmath42 as being scalars , and @xmath43 as being a pseudoscalar .",
    "that identification can only be done when a specific yukawa lagrangian , coupling the two scalar doublets to the fermion sector , is considered , which i do not do here . specifically , as is clear from eq .",
    "[ j1 ] , @xmath42 and @xmath43 play a completely equivalent role in @xmath0 indeed , as long as there are no yukawa couplings , @xmath42 and @xmath43 may rotate into each other by a simple u(1 ) rephasing of @xmath37 . also , @xmath0 can not be the source of , say , cp violation in the kaon system .",
    "if fermions are introduced in the model , the mixing of the neutral scalars will in principle lead to more cp violation than simply @xmath0 , because of the yukawa interactions of the scalars with the fermions .",
    "let us consider how cp violation proportional to @xmath0 arises in the decay modes that i consider here .",
    "all the vertices needed for the calculations in this paper have been listed in figure 1 .",
    "the tree - level diagram with incoming particles @xmath22 , @xmath52 and @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath53 , while the diagram with incoming particles @xmath21 , @xmath54 and @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath55 . now take a look at figure 2 , in which all the one - loop diagrams which lead to cp violation when interfering with the tree - level diagram are collected . consider for instance the first diagram , with a loop of @xmath56 , and then @xmath2 , as an intermediate state",
    "that diagram is equal to @xmath57 , times a certain momentum integral @xmath58 .",
    "the seven factors of @xmath59 come , three from the vertices , three from the propagators , and one from the wick rotation in the momentum integral .",
    "therefore , the interference of this diagram with the tree - level one is proportional to the real part of @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath61-matrix factor has an imaginary part equal to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , if the momentum integral has an absorptive ( _ i.e. _ , imaginary ) part , then the interference term will include @xmath0 times that absorptive part .",
    "this is cp - violating . the absorptive part of the integral plays in the calculation the role of a cp - invariant final - state - interaction phase , which allows @xmath0 to manifest itself .",
    "we can check in a similar fashion that the absorptive parts of all other nine one - loop diagrams in figure 2 lead , when one considers the interference of those diagrams with the tree - level one , to cp violation .",
    "indeed , a careful study of the model and all its vertices shows that the ten diagrams in figure 2 are the only ones which lead to cp violation proportional to @xmath0 in this process .",
    "the cp violation manifests itself in a difference of the decay rates of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , or of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , whichever pair of decays is kinematically allowed .",
    "let me be more explicit . at tree - level ,",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath64 , or for the decay @xmath6 , is @xmath65 , from the tree - level vertex . here",
    ", @xmath66 is the polarization vector of the outgoing @xmath21 , and @xmath67 is the incoming momentum of the @xmath27 .",
    "this is because the polarization vector of the @xmath21 is orthogonal to the momentum of that vector boson . at one - loop level , for the same reason , each diagram in figure 2 contributes @xmath68 .",
    "here , @xmath69 are the various @xmath59 factors and @xmath61-matrix factors from the vertices and propagators in the diagram , and @xmath58 is the momentum integral , with the @xmath59 coming from the wick rotation . the amplitudes for the cp - conjugated decays",
    "are , at tree - level , @xmath70 , and , at one - loop level from figure 2 , @xmath71 .",
    "notice that , while the momentum integral is the same , the vertex factors are complex - conjugated .",
    "then , the cp - violating asymmetries are @xmath72 \\left [ { \\rm or } \\hspace{1 mm } \\frac{{\\rm br } ( h^+ \\rightarrow x_1 w^+ ) - { \\rm br } ( h^- \\rightarrow x_1 w^-)}{{\\rm br } ( h^+ \\rightarrow x_1 w^+ ) + { \\rm br } ( h^- \\rightarrow x_1 w^- ) } \\right ] & \\approx & 2 g^2\\ , \\sum_{k=1}^{10}\\ , \\frac{{\\rm i m } [ ( t_{21 } + i t_{31 } ) c_k]\\ , { \\rm re } ( i i_k)}{1 - t_{11}^2}\\ , , \\label{asymmetry}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i used the orthogonality of @xmath44 to write @xmath73 . the imaginary part of @xmath74 is simply @xmath0 times a number  typically @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "the momentum integral @xmath58 ( the @xmath59 is from the wick rotation ) has a real part if cuts in the corresponding diagram lead to absorptive parts .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "[ asymmetry ] i have used the approximation of taking , in the denominator , only the square of the modulus of the tree - level contribution to the amplitude .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "[ asymmetry ] that the asymmetry will be of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the sum of the absorptive parts of all the diagrams in figure 2 , weighted by appropriate numbers @xmath75 or @xmath76 ( see the preceding paragraph ) .",
    "as one is interested in how large the asymmetry can be , i now consider the mixing - matrix factor in eq .  [ form ] .",
    "because one is constrained by the orthogonality condition @xmath79 , it is obvious that that factor will be maximal when @xmath80 , and we will then have @xmath81 clearly , the order of magnitude of this quantity @xmath82 is 1 .",
    "it is at this point important to remark that , in this specific example , the cp - violating asymmetry approaches its maximum when the decay rate decreases . indeed , as @xmath83 , the asymmetry becomes potentially larger ( as long as @xmath84 remains equal to @xmath85 ) , but the decay rate , which is proportional to @xmath86 , approaches zero .",
    "similarly , the decay rate becomes larger if @xmath87 , but then @xmath88 and the cp asymmetry also vanishes .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the case of cp - violating asymmetries in decay modes of the @xmath89 mesons , which are generally predicted to be larger when the branching ratios are smaller , and vice - versa .",
    "a way to check that the diagrams in figure 2 are all the relevant ones is to check whether their computation yields a gauge - invariant result . because i just want to compute the absorptive parts of the diagrams , which are finite , it is sufficient to compute the diagrams in the unitary gauge , in which no goldstone bosons and no ghosts are present .",
    "however , in a general t - hooft gauge , in each of the diagrams in figure 2 , a @xmath90 can be used instead of the @xmath32 , or a @xmath40 can be used instead of the @xmath17 . in the two diagrams which have a loop only of @xmath32 or of @xmath17 ( diagrams 1 and 2 ) , ghost loops must also be considered in an t - hooft gauge .",
    "now , in an t - hooft gauge , the @xmath32 propagator contains an extra piece ( relative to the unitary gauge ) in which the @xmath32 has an unphysical squared mass @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , the charged goldstone bosons @xmath90 and the charged ghosts @xmath92 have unphysical squared mass @xmath91 in an t - hooft gauge . when @xmath91 is not infinite as in the unitary gauge , each diagram by itself contains a @xmath93-dependent absorptive part . however , all those unphysical absorptive parts must cancel out when one considers the whole set of diagrams .",
    "the same thing can be said about the propagators of the @xmath17 , which has a piece with unphysical squared mass @xmath94 , and of the goldstone boson @xmath40 and ghost @xmath95 , which have squared mass @xmath94 .",
    "( in principle , @xmath96 . ) the whole set of propagators is given in figure 3 .",
    "the sum over all diagrams of all the absorptive parts must be independent of both @xmath91 and @xmath94 .",
    "i have checked that independence .    to be sure",
    ", gauge - independence only applies to an observable quantity .",
    "thus , gauge - independence in this case only occurs when 1 ) the three external particles are all on mass shell , that is , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the incoming momenta of the external @xmath27 , @xmath32 , and @xmath1 , respectively ; 2 ) one suppresses from the amplitude all terms proportional to @xmath103 , because the amplitude must be multiplied by the polarization vector @xmath66 of the @xmath32 , and @xmath104 ; 3 ) one considers , from each one - loop diagram , only the part which is proportional to @xmath0 upon interference with the tree - level amplitude ; 4 ) one only considers the absorptive part of each one - loop diagram .",
    "one has also to take into consideration that the gauge - dependent absorptive parts sometimes cancel between two similar diagrams with intermediate virtual particle @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 , whenever those absorptive parts do not depend on the mass of that intermediate particle ( @xmath31 or @xmath30 ) ; while other absorptive parts cancel among different - looking diagrams .",
    "i present in this section the results of the computation of each of the ten diagrams in figure 2 .",
    "i am only interested in the absorptive part of each diagram .",
    "those absorptive parts are simpler to compute when the power of the integration momentum @xmath105 in the denominator is lower ; in particular , if only one propagator @xmath106 occurs in the denominator , there is no absorptive part .",
    "moreover , i want to display explicitly how the cancellations which lead to gauge invariance of the whole result occur .",
    "therefore , my method has been the following .",
    "first i have added , for each particular diagram , the contributions with gauge bosons , the ones with goldstone bosons , and the ones with ghosts .",
    "then , i have simplified as much as possible the numerators of the integrands , in such a way that factors in some terms of those numerators cancel out some of the propagators in the denominators , thereby reducing the overall power of the integration momentum @xmath105 in the denominator . as a result",
    ", each diagram becomes the sum of three parts : one piece with an overall @xmath107 in the denominator , leading to no absorptive part ; one piece with @xmath108 in the denominator ; and  for the diagrams 7 through 10 only  one piece with @xmath109 in the denominator .",
    "i write down here the two latter pieces only , because they are the only ones which lead to absorptive parts in the integrals .    for each diagram",
    ", i have taken separately the factors with @xmath61-matrix elements , and all the @xmath59 factors from both the vertices and the propagators , multiplied that by the factor @xmath110 arising in the interference with the tree - level diagram , and taken the imaginary part of the result .",
    "that imaginary part is always a multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "this i did because it is only the quantities @xmath111 $ ] which are relevant for the computation of the asymmetry , according to eq .",
    "[ asymmetry ] . also , it is only for these quantities @xmath111 $ ] that the cancellation of the gauge dependence must occur . as a consequence ,",
    "each momentum integral presented below should be looked upon as being an @xmath58 in the notation of section 2 ( the @xmath59 arising when the wick rotation is performed ) , and only the absorptive parts of each such momentum integral are meaningful in this context .",
    "each diagram in figure 2 is in reality two diagrams , one in which an intermediate state @xmath2 appears , and another one in which the intermediate state is @xmath3 .",
    "those two diagrams have , as is easily seen , opposite signs of @xmath0 in the interference term @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "therefore , if the corresponding momentum integrals happen not to depend on the masses @xmath30 or @xmath31  because the propagator of @xmath2 or of @xmath3 might have been cancelled out by a similar factor in the numerator of the integrand  then those terms become irrelevant for the present computation . as a consequence , for each diagram ,",
    "i only write down those integrals which do depend on @xmath30 or @xmath31 .    as before ,",
    "@xmath102 , @xmath101 and @xmath100 are the incoming momenta of the scalar @xmath1 , the gauge boson @xmath22 , and the charged scalar @xmath52 .",
    "i have systematically set all three external particles on mass - shell , and used whenever possible @xmath104 in order to simplify the amplitudes .",
    "i first define the various combinations of the integration momentum @xmath105 and of the incoming momenta , and of the masses , which appear in the denominators of the momentum integrals .",
    "they are @xmath112 notice that only @xmath113 depends on @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to define the `` triangular function '' @xmath114 : @xmath115 this function is negative if and only if one can form a triangle with sides of length @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "i now present the results for the first three diagrams .",
    "diagram 1 : @xmath119 diagram 2 : @xmath120 ( there is an extra factor @xmath121 in diagram 2 relative to diagram 1 , which is a symmetry factor , due to the two identical @xmath122 s in the loop . )",
    "diagram 3 : @xmath123 the results for each of these three diagrams are separately gauge - invariant .",
    "this is because the gauge - dependent piece in each of them ( the piece depending on either @xmath91 or @xmath94 ) is the same , for each case , in the diagram with an intermediate @xmath2 , and in the diagram with an intermediate @xmath3 .",
    "as the sign of the @xmath0 factor is opposite , the gauge - dependent piece cancels out between the diagrams with intermediate @xmath2 and those with intermediate @xmath3 .",

    "the integral @xmath178 is finite and , eliminating its part proportional to @xmath103 , one obtains @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 in a positive infinitesimal quantity .",
    "using now the fact that the imaginary part of @xmath182 is @xmath183 , and then integrating over the feynman parameter @xmath184 , thereby getting rid of the dirac @xmath185 function , one gets @xmath186 here , the integral must be performed over that part of the interval @xmath148 $ ] for which the two values of @xmath184 defined by the condition @xmath187 are positive and smaller than 1 . that sub - interval of @xmath148 $ ] must be found for each of the four integrals of the type @xmath178 individually .",
    "it is larger or smaller according to whether some cuts can be made in the corresponding feynman diagram : namely , whether @xmath188 or not , and whether @xmath189 or not . in any case , the integral over @xmath140 can be performed analytically , and it yields a rather complicated logarithmic function .",
    "we now have all the ingredients needed to compute the asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry is equal to @xmath190 times a mixing - matrix factor , studied in section 2 , which should be of order @xmath191 to @xmath192 , times the sum @xmath78 of all absorptive parts , which itself includes a suppression factor @xmath193 .",
    "now , one should note that the absorptive parts of diagrams 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 all diverge when @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) approach @xmath29 .",
    "this is simply because in those diagrams one has a scalar @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) propagating with momentum @xmath102 such that @xmath99 .",
    "those divergences do not cancel in the absorptive parts , because the specific values of those absorptive parts depend on different parameters : in diagram 1 , on the decay width @xmath194 , in diagram 2 , on the decay width @xmath195 , in diagram 3 , on the decay width @xmath4 , and , in diagram 6 , on the decay width @xmath162 or @xmath196 .",
    "of course , we know that these divergences are not genuine , they might be eliminated by a proper treatment in which one would take into account the finite width of the propagating @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and besides , from a different line of reasoning @xcite , one knows anyway that cp violation disappears and @xmath0 loses its meaning when the masses of any two of the three neutral scalars become equal . a proper treatment of these divergences at @xmath197 or @xmath198 would lead me far astray , and therefore i simply avoided , in general , considering the region of the parameter space in which either @xmath30 or @xmath31 are close to @xmath29 .    avoiding those regions in which the present approximation loses its validity , i find that the sum @xmath78 of all absorptive parts is typically of order of magnitude @xmath199 or @xmath200 .",
    "a few examples are presented in the following table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is worth remarking that the total absorptive part @xmath78 is always the final result of substantial cancellations among the absorptive parts , with different signs , of the various individual diagrams .",
    "in this paper i have presented a model calculation of a cp - violating asymmetry in the two - scalar - doublet model .",
    "the asymmetry chosen has been the different decay rates for @xmath4 and for @xmath5 .",
    "i believe this to be a quite interesting place to look for cp violation in the scalar sector , even if the present calculation turns out not to be very relevant .",
    "this might happen mainly because i have taken into account only one source of cp violation , @xmath0 in the gauge interactions of the scalars , while i neglected further sources of cp violation , in the cubic scalar interactions and in the yukawa interactions with the fermions . even within the context of the approximation that i have used , in which the decay proceeds essentially because of a tree - level vertex , while the cp violation arises because of the interference of that tree - level vertex with one - loop diagrams with absorptive parts , those further sources of cp violation will in principle lead to extra contributions to the total asymmetry .",
    "my interest here has been to ilustrate the specific way in which @xmath0 arises in the computation of a cp asymmetry .",
    "i observed that there is a kind of balance between the cp asymmetry and the decay rate in this specific case  but only if the only source of cp violation is taken to be @xmath0  , with a large asymmetry being possible only when the decay rate is small , and vice - versa .",
    "i found that the asymmetry can attain values of order @xmath200 .",
    "these values would increase or decrease if the interference with other sources of cp violation in this mode were constructive or destructive .    because of the presence of gauge bosons in the internal lines of the one - loop diagrams that i had to compute , i found it convenient to check the gauge invariance of the whole calculation .",
    "i checked that the fictitious masses that appear in the propagators of the @xmath32 and of the @xmath17 , and of the corresponding goldstone bosons and ghosts , in a general t hooft gauge , lead to gauge - dependent absorptive parts for the individual diagrams , which however cancel out when all the diagrams which lead to cp violation proportional to @xmath0 are considered .",
    "this constitutes a good check that one did not omit any diagram .",
