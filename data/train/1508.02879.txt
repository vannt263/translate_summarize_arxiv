    "large - scale spiral density waves commonly arise in a protoplanetary disc due to the gravitational instabilities at the early stage of disc life , when it is sufficiently massive .",
    "it has been known for some time that the density waves can act to transport angular momentum outwards , allowing mass to accrete onto the protostar , and could well be the primary transport mechanism provided thus by disc self - gravity during the earliest stages of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the other perturbation type in discs that has received much attention , partly in connection with planetesimal formation ,",
    "are vortices .",
    "they can arise in both self - gravitating and non - self - gravitating discs by several means .",

    "vortices can also be generated as a result of other hydrodynamic instabilities , such as the baroclinic instability @xcite or the kelvin - helmholtz instability of seed vorticity strips @xcite .",
    "although the dynamics and evolution of vortices in non - self - gravitating discs has been under active investigation for a while , since the first idea of their relevance to planet formation by @xcite , systematic studies of vortex dynamics in self - gravitating discs are quite recent @xcite .",
    "it was commonly thought that spiral density waves are the only perturbation type present in self - gravitating discs , and the existence of other modes also participating in the overall disc dynamics had been ignored in many studies of self - gravitating discs .",
    "developments in the theory of non - self - gravitating discs , however , showed that vortices can be ( linearly ) coupled with , and excite , spiral density waves due to the disc s differential rotation @xcite .",
    "this effect was demonstrated to be even more efficient in the presence of self - gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , a linear analysis by @xcite showed that in fact vortical mode is also subject to the influence of self - gravity and can exhibit gravitational instability with amplification factors comparable to that of density waves .",
    "this clearly implies that vortices are as important as density waves in forming a complete dynamical picture of self - gravitating discs .",
    "subsequent nonlinear dynamics and evolution of vortices varies greatly in non - self - gravitating and self - gravitating systems . in non - self - gravitating discs , small - scale ( anticyclonic ) vortices , soon after formation , smoothly merge into each other and increase in size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "when the vortices reach a few scale height , compressibility becomes important , causing them to emit spiral density waves - due to the above - mentioned mode coupling phenomenon - and , consequently , slowly decay on the time - scale of several hundred orbital periods @xcite . in spite of this shock dissipation ,",
    "anticyclonic vortices can be considered long - lived , coherent structures in discs .",
    "however , they can be subject to radial migration @xcite and/or to the elliptical instability @xcite , the typical time - scale of which is larger than vortex turnover / orbital time , as well as to destruction by the magnetorotational instability in magnetized regions @xcite .",
    "the vortex merging is resisted under the influence of disc self - gravity and smaller size vortices are favoured @xcite . in some sense , self - gravity acts to oppose the inverse cascade of spectral energy to larger scales , as occurs in the non - self - gravitating case , and , instead , scatters it to smaller scales . the local shearing sheet simulations of radially unstructured ( i.e. , in the absence of baroclinic or rossby wave instabilities ) discs by @xcite demonstrate that vortices in a quasi - steady gravitoturbulence are transient , short - lived structures undergoing repeating cycles of formation , growth to sizes comparable to the local jeans length , and eventual shearing and destruction due to the effects of self - gravity and keplerian shear .",
    "this process lasts a few orbital periods , and results in a very different , compared to the non - self - gravitating case , evolutionary picture , with many small , less organized vortices ( eddies ) in various stages of evolution , rather than the relatively larger scale well organized vortices gradually growing via slow mergers . on the other hand , in global simulations by @xcite discs",
    "are radially structured and , although they remain laminar ( without gravitoturbulence ) , develop vortices via rossby wave instability at vortensity minimum . due to self - gravity ,",
    "these vortices have a smaller azimuthal extent ( i.e. , higher azimuthal wavenumbers ) compared with similar ones without self - gravity . what is noteworthy , however",
    ", vortices in both local and global simulations share a common feature  they produce over - densities at their centres coinciding with the minima of toomre s parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these over - densities are imposed on the density variations due to shocks of density waves emitted by these vortices .    in massive discs ,",
    "the gravitational instabilities have been shown to cause the disc to fragment , possibly leading to the direct formation of gas giant planets @xcite .",
    "although a massive protoplanetary disc is thought to be present at early times in the star formation process , it is not clear that such discs can cool fast enough due to radiative transfer to directly form giant planets via this mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , even if the effective cooling times present within discs are too long to allow giant planets to form via fragmentation , as mentioned above , protoplanetary discs are very likely self - gravitating in their early stages @xcite , sometimes even at the t tauri stage @xcite . in this case , indirect means of planet formation  accumulation of dust particles in gaseous density structures that arise as a result of the gravitational instability",
    " could be at work .",
    "as outlined above , such structures can be either due to density waves or to smaller scale vortices .    in low mass discs , where self - gravity is negligible",

    "not including self - gravity , dust grains with a wide range of sizes were shown to be trapped within the centres of the vortex structures with the strongest concentration occurring for particles with friction / stopping times comparable to the local orbital period . in other words ,",
    "a smooth , sufficiently long - lived vortex is indeed able to effectively trap dust particles in its core , possibly accelerating planetesimal formation .    to date",
    ", however , the evolution of dust particles in self - gravitating discs has been primarily studied in a large scale setting , concentrating on the effect spiral density waves , in the gaseous component of the disc , have on dust particles .",
    "@xcite used global simulations to show that the presence of spiral density waves in the disc can have a dramatic effect on the particle layer . in @xcite , the dust particles are assumed to interact with the disc solely via an aerodynamic drag force .",
    "the particles , especially those with stopping times comparable to the local orbital period , are shown to become trapped within the density wave structures that form in the disc due to self - gravity .",
    "this causes the local density of solid material within the density waves to rise by an order of magnitude or more compared to the average .",
    "the gas pressure gradient changes from positive to negative across the density wave structure , creating sub - keplerian velocities on one side of the wave , and super - keplerian on the other . as a result",
    ", the drag force causes dust grains to drift toward the density / pressure maxima at the crest of density waves .",
    "@xcite generalized these findings by including the gravitational effects of the solid particles themselves , which allow these particle enhancements to become even more pronounced , resulting in gravitationally bound clumps , or planetesimals , forming in the disc .",
    "more recently , these results were expanded on in @xcite using higher resolution two - dimensional ( 2d ) local shearing sheet simulations of self - gravitating gaseous discs , treated as in related local studies @xcite , with added numerical super - particles to model dust - particle dynamics .",
    "these studies found that the spiral density waves are very efficient at trapping relatively small , from several centimeter up to meter - sized particles , whose stopping times are comparable to the local orbital period .",
    "very tightly bound clumps of particles can form in the crests of these spiral waves due to the strong gravitational attraction between particles at such high concentrations .",
    "these processes can result in a substantial population of large , planetesimal - sized solid objects being rapidly formed in the early stages of disc evolution , paving the way for terrestrial and gas giant planet formation via the traditional core - accretion model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dust particles can also become trapped by pressure maxima associated with ( anticyclonic ) vortices and , as mentioned above , this process has been extensively studied in non - self - gravitating discs . the role of vortices in trapping dust in self - gravitating discs is less understood and needs further investigation , because of the different character of vortex evolution with self - gravity .",
    "particle concentration by vortices , as well as vortex dynamics itself in the presence of self - gravity , was first addressed by @xcite via global disc simulations . however , in their set - up vortices are generated by the rossby wave instability in an otherwise laminar disc and have a long - lived regular nature - as in the non - self - gravitating case - though smaller azimuthal size due to the effect of self - gravity . here , we consider a different situation  a self - gravitating disc in a quasi - steady gravitoturbulent state , without continuous driving by global baroclinic or rossby wave instabilities , and analyse the behaviour of embedded dust particles using the shearing sheet approximation .",
    "we would like to note that on shorter ( comparable to the disc scale height or less ) length - scales just such a gravitoturbulent state , rather than a regular / coherent one , is more common in self - gravitating discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as shown by @xcite , this state consists of transient short - lived small - scale vortices producing over - dense regions overlaid on density wave structures .",
    "in other words , we extend this study by including dust particles with a goal of understanding the role these vortical structures play in dust evolution .",
    "dust dynamics in the presence of only density waves in the shearing sheet has been explored in our previous papers @xcite , where larger domain sizes were used . here , we take a smaller size domain that enables us to zoom in on smaller scale vortical structures and examine their dust trapping capability against the backdrop of density variations due to the density waves ( shocks ) .",
    "this will help us to establish the role of vortices in planet formation process in self - gravitating discs .",

    "we outline the physical set - up and initial conditions adopted in our simulations . in section 3 , we discuss the evolution of the dust particles in the the vortex structures in the gas .",
    "finally , summary and discussions are given in section 4 .",
    "to investigate the dynamics of solid particles embedded in a self - gravitating protoplanetary disc , we solve the 2d local shearing sheet equations for gas on a fixed grid , including disc self - gravity , together with the equations of motion of solid particles coupled to the gas through aerodynamic drag force .",

    ", the gas density and pv fields are shown in figs .",
    "[ gas_dens_sg ] and [ vor_field_sg ] , respectively .",
    "remarkably , majority of these clumps are formed within the vortices .",
    "consistent with the above case before switching on particle self - gravity ( fig .",
    "[ surf_density ] ) , the particles with @xmath87 experience clumping in over - dense rings around vortices , whereas larger particles with @xmath82 in more diffuse vortices with negative and smaller by absolute value pv ( curly areas in fig .",
    "[ vor_field_sg ] ) . as mentioned above , these evolved",
    "vortices tend to give rise to higher over - densities in the gas than the density waves do , as evident from fig .",
    "[ gas_dens_sg ] ( especially the one in the central - lower region ) .",
    "thus , irregular , smaller vortices appear to be more efficient at trapping particles than relatively large scale density waves .",
    "this suggests that vortical perturbations can be as important as density waves in accumulating solids in self - gravitating discs .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the particle trapping properties of vortices and the potential role they can play in the planet formation process at the early stage of protoplanetary disc life , when most of its interior is dense and cool and self - gravity is a dominant agent governing the dynamics and evolution of the disc .",
    "however , mass accretion due to the gravitational instability can raise the temperature and activate the magnetorotational instability in the inner disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this effect is beyond the scope of the present analysis , which focuses on the effects of the gravitational instability only .",
    "we used a similar simulation set - up as adopted in our previous work @xcite , but took a smaller simulation domain , which allowed us to capture small - scale vortical structures against a backdrop of larger scale density waves .",
    "the large - scale picture of the early stages of planetesimal and planet formation described in the above papers remains unchanged : dust particles accumulate within a quasi - steady gaseous spiral structure produced by a combined effect of disc self - gravity and cooling .",
    "the work performed here gives us deeper insight into how smaller scale processes affect the dynamics and evolution of particles in the quasi - steady gravitoturbulence . in this state , the smaller scale turbulent vortical motions ( eddies ) leave their traces in the evolution of the gas density by producing over - dense regions along with spiral density waves .",
    "particles are accumulated both in crests of density waves and in the anticyclonic irregularly - shaped unsteady vortices .",
    "vortices with small , by absolute value , pv are characterized by higher over - densities than those with larger , by absolute value , pv and consequently the particle concentrations in the former turn out to be accordingly higher , even larger than in the density waves for smaller and intermediate - sized particles ( fig .",
    "[ surf_density ] ) .",
    "when the self - gravity of the solid component of the disc is introduced , the particle over - densities that form within these irregular vortices and wave crests rapidly undergo gravitational collapse , forming bound clumps with local densities hundreds of times larger than the typical gas densities within the sheet .",
    "remarkably , the number of clumps formed in the vortices is somewhat larger than that formed in the wave crests ( fig .",
    "[ surf_density_sg ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the degree of particle concentration in these structures and hence their clumping property depend on their friction time .",
    "we found that small and intermediate - sized dust particles corresponding to friction times comparable to , or less than , the local orbital period of the disc , @xmath88 , become especially tightly trapped .",
    "this suggests that vortical perturbations , which generally are an essential ingredient , together with density waves , in the dynamics of self - gravitating discs can also play an important role in the trapping of dust particles and planetesimal formation at early stages of disc life .",
    "we would like to stress once again that the principal reason for high densities and clumping of particles occurring in this problem is their self - gravity . here",
    ", we have not included particle collisions and one might ask how this effect could modify the results . @xcite investigated the effect of collisions on the particle dynamics in gaseous discs . they found that collisions , which become more important at high particle concentrations , actually tend to promote particle concentration via damping their rms velocities : the maximum densities of particles including collisions turned out to be more than a factor of three higher compared to those without collisions .",
    "the collisions also seem to have no apparent effect on the further clumping / collapse process of these particle concentrations due to their own self - gravity .",
    "the masses of the most massive particle clumps ( planetesimals ) formed are relatively insensitive to the presence or absence of collisions . based on these results",
    ", we anticipate that inclusion of collisions in our problem would not much alter a basic dynamical behavior of particles , although extension of this study with treatment of collisions between numerical super - particles ( for example , such as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is needed to support this conclusion .    in this study , we have considered the simplified case of a razor - thin ( 2d ) disc with a simple cooling law in order to gain first insight into the effects of vortices on dust particles in the presence of self - gravity . obviously , for a fuller understanding , three - dimensional ( 3d ) treatment of vortices , with embedded particles , in self - gravitating discs is necessary , which , as far as we are aware , has not been done yet .",
    "the dynamics of 3d vortices in non - self - gravitating discs has been investigated in a number of studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the 3d case , in contrast to the 2d one , they are subject to the elliptical instability , which eventually destroys vortices",
    "however , stratification and baroclinic / rossby wave driving can counteract the elliptical instability , saving vortices from destruction .",
    "a self - gravitating 3d disc is clearly stratified in the vertical direction .",
    "on the other hand , self - gravity does not favour long - lived regular vortices .",
    "but in the 3d case , the effect of self - gravity is somewhat reduced compared to that in the 2d case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it remains to be seen in future numerical studies how the combination of the above factors shapes the dynamics of 3d vortices in self - gravitating discs .",
    "when analyzing behaviour of particles in such 3d vortices in self - gravitating discs , one must also take into account the basic effects in the particle dynamics being at work in 3d  sedimentation due to vertical gravity and stir up and clumping of the dust layer due to the kelvin - helmholtz and streaming instabilities , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the work presented here expands on the picture of the early stages of planetesimal formation built up by @xcite , which still presents an attractive method for the rapid creation of a large reservoir of planetesimals , along with several massive objects of mass @xmath89 .",
    "these objects are then likely to continue to grow via the traditional core accretion process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . further work , which allows the replacement of large , gravitationally bound accumulations of particles with ` sink ' particles , interacting with the disc and with each other , could expand the scope of simulations such as those presented above .",
    "this would allow for the subsequent evolution of these planetesimal - sized objects and could proved further insight into how quickly the core accretion process can work in self - gravitating discs .",

    "to investigate the effects of resolution on the dynamics of vortices in the presence of self - gravity , we ran simulations for a domain with half size , @xmath90 ( in units of @xmath91 , initial @xmath92 ) at three different resolutions @xmath93 , including the same number of particles and starting with the same initial conditions as in the paper .",
    "this is equivalent to running the fiducial model with @xmath94 considered in this work at doubled resolutions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , since the corresponding grid cell sizes , @xmath97 would be the same in both cases .",
    "so far as numerical convergence is concerned , grid cell size is a central length - scale , since measuring various physical lengths of the system against it allows us to find out whether a simulation is resolved .",
    "therefore , due to the same grid cell sizes , a resolution study we do for the half - size model also establishes whether vortices in the fiducial model are sufficiently resolved .    in the quasi - steady state , the pv fields from all these three runs at the same time are shown in fig .",
    "a1 . these fields , being at different resolutions ,",
    "display essentially identical structures , indicating that they are resolved . to put this conclusion on more quantitative grounds , as in @xcite",
