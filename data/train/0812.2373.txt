    "the read - out of ionization electrons traveling in a uniform electric field provides the spacial reconstruction of an event and allows for calorimetric measurement of the energy release . in year 2001 , the t600 icarus detector was extensively tested in pavia ( italy ) , with an exposure to cosmic rays at the earth surface . during over 100 days of continuous data taking , about 30000 cosmic ray events have been collected . in a series of papers",
    "the icarus collaboration presented the following results from the t600 detector test run : observation of long ionizing tracks  @xcite , lar purity  @xcite , electron recombination in lar  @xcite and measurement of through - going particle momentum by means of multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the sample of stopping @xmath5 events led to the measurement of the @xmath5 decay spectrum , and allowed to determine the energy resolution of the t600 icarus detector for the measurement of electrons with energy lower than about 50 mev  @xcite .",
    "+ the icarus t600 detector is at present in the final phases of re - assembling in the underground hall b at infn laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) , italy , and its commissioning is foreseen to start within the year 2008 .",
    "+ in this paper we discuss the icarus detector capabilities in electromagnetic shower reconstruction through the analysis of a sample of events with hadronic interactions leading to the production of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the decay of a particle with known mass gives a good test for the energy calibration .",
    "another motivation for such studies is the following : in order to distinguish @xmath6 charge current ( cc ) interaction    @xmath7    from the @xmath8 neutral current interaction    @xmath9    a very good detector capability to separate electrons and pions is required .",
    "the @xmath0 decays in about 98.8% into two photons .",
    "the dalitz decays , leading to the production of one photon and electron - positron pair , compose about 1.2% . both photons and electrons may create electromagnetic showers and therefore lead to the similar event topology for both nc and cc interactions .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the icarus t600 detector set - up is briefly described in section [ setup ] . section [ selection ] concerns the search and the selection of cosmic ray hadronic interactions in t600 detector with the production of the @xmath0 meson . in section [ reconstruction ]",
    "the methods used for the measurement of the energy released in lar by the two electromagnetic showers coming from @xmath0 @xmath10 @xmath1 @xmath1 decay and for the reconstruction of @xmath0 mass are illustrated .",
    "the analysis of the selected event sample from real data is presented in section [ realdata ] . in section [ showres ] the precision in the measurement of the electromagnetic shower energy deposition in lar",
    "is evaluated in the condition of the test experiment through a simulation of electrons and photons showering inside t600 detector . in section [ validation ] the monte carlo simulations of @xmath0 in icarus t600 ,",
    "used to validate the reconstruction routines for electromagnetic showers , are shown . in section [ nusim ]",
    "the same method of event reconstruction used for the real data is applied to monte carlo simulated muon neutrino interactions with @xmath2 production .",
    "the possible mixing of such events with the electron neutrino cc interaction is discussed .",
    "the work is summarized and concluded in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the t600 icarus detector is composed of two identical adjacent `` t300 '' half - modules filled with liquid argon . two time projection chambers ( tpcs ) with common cathode placed in the middle , the electric field shaping system , lar purity monitors and photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) are enclosed in each half - module .",
    "the external thermal insulation , together with a liquid nitrogen circuit , allows to stabilize the lar temperature .",
    "the required lar purity is achieved by a purification system .",
    "each t300 half - module has the following internal dimensions : 3.6 m ( width ) , 3.9 m ( height ) and 19.9 m ( length ) . along the longest side walls ( left and right ) of each half - module ,",
    "three parallel planes ( two _ induction _ planes and one _ collection _ plane ) of anode wires are placed .",

    "they are oriented at 60@xmath11 with respect to each other , 3 mm apart , with wire pitch of 3 mm .",
    "the total number of wires in the t600 detector is 53248 , whereas the volume of lar in the instrumented part of the detector is 340.3 m@xmath12 ( 476.5 tons ) .",
    "the ionization electrons , forced by a uniform electric field of 500 v / cm perpendicular to the cathode , drift toward the anode wires inducing a signal on those which they pass by .",
    "the appropriate voltage biasing causes non - destructive signal to be induced first on two induction wire planes , whereas the ionization electrons charge is finally collected in the collection wire plane . by combining the information from two - dimensional projections , provided by each pair of wire planes , with the position along the drift time , it is possible to obtain a three - dimensional reconstruction of an event .",

    "+ it has to be stressed that the t600 icarus test run internal trigger based on photomultipliers was aimed at air showers , so that many events were not measurable because of their complexity due to a crowded environment .",
    "the surface exposure has in fact as a result that a number of candidate @xmath2 events can lie in zones of the detector of strong pile up of cosmic ray events , which can partially overlap the electromagnetic showers of the photons of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "this affects either the capability of the visual scanning in disentangling the good events from an environment populated by many through - going particles or the precision in the shower energy reconstruction for selected events with partial overlap with cosmic ray events .",
    "+ the following scanning rules were adopted for the pre - selection of hadronic interactions with @xmath2 production :    * at least two , well separated electromagnetic showers originated by photons pointing to the interaction vertex are demanded .",

    "+ * knowledge of the event zero time ( @xmath14 ) is mandatory in order to determine the interaction vertex and the shower spatial positions in the chamber , as well as to apply proper corrections to the collected signals for the charge attenuation due to the finite electron lifetime in argon , associated to the electron attachment process to electro - negative impurities . +",
    "a unique @xmath14 determination is possible in the following cases : ( 1 ) at least one track ( but not showers ) from the interaction is crossing the anode wires ( @xmath14 = 0 @xmath5s for crossing points ) ; ( 2 ) at least one track ( but not showers ) is crossing the cathode plane ( @xmath14 = 962 @xmath5s for crossing points ) ; ( 3 ) an unique association between the interaction and the pmt induces signals on collection wires ( fig .",

    "some of them were the products of @xmath75 or k meson decays .",
    "wrong assignment of the decay vertex obviously leads to a shift in the reconstructed mass . in the lar tpc",
    "the good spatial resolution allows to distinguish majority of the secondary verteces if their distance from the main hadronic interaction vertex is larger than about 1 cm . the problem is much more severe in water or sandwich - like detectors which are characterized by much worse spatial resolution .",
    "it should be noted that the expected percentage of the all secondary neutral pions was found to be as large as about 25% at 2 gev and 43% at 5 gev in fluka based generator .",
    "an event with @xmath49 production in nc @xmath76 interaction can be misidentified with an electron from cc @xmath77 interaction if one of the two following configurations occurs :    * one photon from the decay can be lost when its energy it is too small to allow its distinction in the crowded environment surrounding it ( e @xmath63 20 mev ) ; the calculation based on the decay kinematics shows that the percentage of events with such decay photon , being a function of the parent pion energy , never exceeds 2.5% .",
    "the showers of energy larger than 20 mev were always properly recognized in the simulated events .",
    "+ * the two photon showers overlap : the angle between the two photon showers from the decay is sufficiently large to allow to distinguish the two showers only for a @xmath2 energy up to about 1 gev . the angle decreases from 70.1@xmath11 at 100 mev to 13.7@xmath11 at 1 gev . if one does not require a full @xmath2 mass reconstruction as a pion selection tool the shower overlap is less critical . the possible overlapping effect for more energetic pion decays",
    "was already studied : it was shown  @xcite that the @xmath78 method can be efficiently applied , in lar detector , to distinguish the beginning of the electron track from the beginning of the lepton pair that comes from the photon conversion .",
    "moreover , internal conversion due to the dalitz decay ( 1.2% of cases ) or conversion close to the primary vertex ( 5.5% of cases within the first 1 cm ) gives raise to misidentification of a photon shower as an electron induced cascade in the 6.7% of cases . in the most frequently populated interval of @xmath49 energy ( 200@xmath36400 mev ) , in about 2% of events the low energy photon can be lost . by multiplying this probability by 0.067 it follows that , in our detector , the total probability of the @xmath2 background is expected to be at the level of 10@xmath79 .",
    "a sample of 212 events with at least two photon showers pointing at the apparent interaction vertex were selected from the data collected during the surface test run of the icarus detector .",
    "methods of measuring the shower energy and shower direction were developed and the invariant mass of the photon pairs was reconstructed .",
    "the position of the maximum in the invariant ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) mass distribution for the 196 @xmath2 candidates , obtained after a fiducial volume cut , was found to be in agreement with the value of the @xmath2 mass , thus confirming the common assumption that the @xmath2s are the main source of the photons .",
    "the rms uncertainty of the reconstructed @xmath2 invariant mass was found to be equal to 36.7 @xmath39 3.4 mev / c@xmath47 ( 27.3% ) .",
    "+ an improved analysis was carried out in order to clean the initial event sample from the events measured in a crowded environment caused by other tracks and interactions surrounding the @xmath2 candidates . as a result , the position of the maximum in the invariant ( @xmath1,@xmath1 ) mass for the 97 surviving @xmath2 candidates was found again to be in agreement with the @xmath2 mass .",
    "moreover , the rms uncertainty of the reconstructed @xmath2 invariant mass was found to be equal to ( 22.6 @xmath39 2.9 ) mev / c@xmath47 ( 16.1% ) , which is significantly narrower than the mass distribution for the initial event sample . the @xmath2 mass distribution was in good agreement with the distributions obtained for the monte carlo generated events with neutral pion production in hadronic and neutrino interactions .",
    "the agreement between the data and the monte carlo confirms the validity of the shower energy and shower direction reconstruction methods .",
    "it also demonstrates the potential of the icarus lar tpc , because simple quality cuts were sufficient to obtain good results in very difficult conditions of the surface test , detector commissioning and tuning of the electronics .",
    "+ it was found that in the photon energy range from 50 to 5000 mev the electromagnetic shower energy resolution @xmath80 can be approximated by the formula @xmath80",
    "= @xmath81 + @xmath61 with the parameters @xmath60 = ( 0.33 @xmath39 0.03 ) @xmath62 and @xmath61 = 0.012 @xmath39 0.002 .",
    "+ to simulate the future measurements in the cngs beam , neutrino interactions at incident energies between 1 and 5 gev were generated using the fluka package .",
    "scanning and measurements of the showers pointing to the primary and secondary verteces were carried out , and the two photon mass was reconstructed for events with different number of showers .",
    "it was demonstrated that in most cases a proper reconstruction of up to the three pions coming from the same vertex was possible .",
    "a few events with @xmath74 meson decay into two photons were found in simulated events and properly reconstructed .",
    "+ the asymmetric decays of @xmath2s as a background to @xmath77 charge current events were discussed .",
    "it was found that it is likely to loose the photon of energy smaller than about 20 mev but the percentage of events with such a photon never exceeds 2.5% .",
    "the frequency of events that could be misidentified with events containing single electron shower , because of the low energy photon lost for either the dalitz decay or the events with the second photon converting close to the neutrino interaction vertex was estimated to be at the level of one per mil . + in summary : our analysis implies very good prospects for the recognition and energy measurement of electromagnetic showers during the icarus running in the gran sasso laboratory , where the background due to other signals in the neighborhood of neutrino interactions will be negligible .",
    "we wish to dedicate this work to the memory of our friend and colleague fulvio mauri , co - author of the paper , who prematurely passed away on march , 2008 .",
