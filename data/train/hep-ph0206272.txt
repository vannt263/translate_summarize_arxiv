    "reheating of the universe , in which the inflaton decay product provide a thermal bath of radiation , is one of the cornerstones of any inflationary model . at the end of inflation",
    "the coherent inflaton condensate may decay either perturbatively @xcite , one quantum at the time , or non - perturbatively @xcite via a parametric resonance in a collective process denoted as preheating . usually in the literature reheating",
    "has been considered to be a volume effect so that it tends to be relatively fast , and as a consequence , the reheat temperature is relatively high . in supersymmetric models",
    "this has turned out to be somewhat problematic because a large reheat temperature generates a large gravitino abundance which is in conflict with the successful big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .    however , recently we have pointed out @xcite a novel possibility in which reheating could be realized as a surface effect , noting that the evaporation rate from a surface is always suppressed by the area of the evaporating surface .",
    "therefore the larger the surface , the smaller the reheat temperature of the universe .",
    "such a situation can be achieved if the zero - mode inflaton condensate does not remain spatially coherent but breaks down into quasi - stable lumps .",
    "this can happen if the inflaton field carries a global @xmath1 charge which protects the lumps ; for instance , the inflaton could be a complex rather than a real scalar field .",
    "the ground state of such a condensate lump would be a non - topological soliton called @xmath0 ball @xcite , the properties of which depend on the exact form of the scalar potential .",
    "a general requirement for its existence is that the scalar potential should grow slower than @xmath2 .",
    "inflaton condensate fragmentation has recently been discussed in the context of hybrid inflation models both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite . however , in these cases the shape of the potential does not render the condensate lumps quasi - stable and their appearance is merely a part of the complicated preheating dynamics .",
    "in fact , there they appear to make reheating even more effective rather than slowing it down @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 ball formation has been considered in detail in the context of the mssm flat direction condensates ( affleck - dine condensates @xcite ) , and can be either completely stable @xcite if susy is broken by gauge mediation , or quasi - stable @xcite if susy is broken by gravity mediation . in the affleck - dine case",
    "the condensate is charged up by a helical motion in the field space , and fragmentation takes place when the fluctuations in the real and the imaginary directions grow to become of order one .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simple case of the chaotic inflation but with a complex inflaton field ( which is rather more natural ) and a running inflaton mass , such as might be generated radiatively by the yukawa and/or gauge couplings of the inflaton to other fields .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that at the end of inflation the inflaton condensate fragments into lumps and forms @xmath0 balls .",
    "the initial fragmentation occurs because of the negative pressure the condensate feels during the inflaton oscillations .",
    "we show that the fluctuations in the imaginary direction grow because of the mode - mode coupling between the real and the imaginary parts and thus provide the motion in field space necessary for solitogenesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe @xmath0 balls in a running mass potential and discuss how the fluctuations grow for a certain running mass inflaton potential in section iii . in section",
    "iv we study @xmath0-ball formation due to mode - mode couplings by lattice simulations .",
    "section v is devoted to the implications of @xmath0-ball formation and a discussion on the reheat temperature . in section",
    "vi we conclude with a brief discussion highlighting the results and describing future prospects .",
    "if the inflaton has couplings to other fields , then , in general , the inflaton mass should receive radiative corrections @xcite . the simplest chaotic inflation potential with a running inflaton mass",
    "could then be written as @xmath3\\,,\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath4 could be negative or positive , and @xmath5 is the bare mass of the inflaton .",
    "the logarithmic correction to the mass of the inflaton is something one would expect to arise because of the possible yukawa and/or gauge couplings to other fields .    since we assume that @xmath6 , the second term in the bracket does not affect the inflaton dynamics or generation of perturbations much so that with a running mass the universe would experience the same chaotic inflationary stage as with the usual @xmath7 potential .",
    "however , as we shall see , the values @xmath8 lead to interesting cosmological consequences .",
    "though it is not pertinent , we note that the potential eq .",
    "( [ qpot ] ) can be generated in a supersymmetric theory if the inflaton has a gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gaugino loops contribute as a negative correction which dominates . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath4 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gaugino mass and @xmath11 denotes the mass of slepton .",
    "it is also possible to obtain the potential eq .",
    "( [ qpot ] ) in a non - supersymmetric ( or in broken susy ) theory , provided the fermions live in a larger representation than the bosons . in this latter situation",
    "the value of @xmath4 is determined by the yukawa coupling @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the total number of fermionic loops , and @xmath14 is the yukawa coupling . as long as @xmath15 , the dominant contribution to the potential comes from @xmath7 term during inflation , and inflationary slow roll conditions are satisfied as in the case of the standard chaotic model .",
    "the generation of the amplitude of the density perturbations are constrained by the cobe normalization , which implies @xmath16 which results in @xmath17  gev .",
    "the most important virtue of the inflationary potential eq .",
    "( [ qpot ] ) is that it respects a global @xmath1 symmetry , and for a negative @xmath4 , the potential is shallower than @xmath7 .",
    "it has been well known that such a potential admits a @xmath0-ball solution @xcite .",
    "this means that the energy of a @xmath0-ball configuration is less than a collection of free scalars carrying an equivalent charge .",

    "depending on the slope of the potential it is possible to have an energetically favorable state in the form of @xmath0 balls .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0 ball is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 lies in the range @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 the @xmath0 ball is stable against decay into other particles if @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the smallest mass of the particles which shares the same @xmath1 charge as the complex field @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the charge carried by the particle . in this case ,",
    "a @xmath0 ball exists forever . on the other hand ,",
    "if the stability condition does not hold , @xmath0 balls will eventually decay into lighter particles .",
    "however , if the ( final ) decay products are pairs of fermions , the decay should proceed by the evaporation of charges through the surface of @xmath0 balls because of the pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "thus , inflatonic @xmath0 balls with a large enough charge could live very long , in which case reheating may take place very slowly , as we shall discuss .    the potential of the form eq .",
    "( [ qpot ] ) generically forms a thick - wall @xmath0 balls with a gaussian profile @xcite @xmath31 so that the size of such a @xmath0 ball can be estimated by @xmath32 the energy of a @xmath0 ball can be approximately given by @xmath33 and the total charge accumulated by a @xmath0 ball is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the field value at which the @xmath0 ball forms , and @xmath36 is the volume of the @xmath0 ball .",
    "in the context of affleck - dine baryogenesis , the homogeneous mode is rotating around the origin in the potential .",
    "in such a case fluctuations tend to grow when on the average there is a negative pressure , which can be achieved in the potential eq .",
    "( [ qpot ] ) when @xmath8 @xcite . expanding the potential in eq .",
    "( [ qpot ] ) one finds @xmath37 where we assume @xmath6 , since this term is actually a correction to a tree level potential .",
    "the equation of state for a field rotating in such a potential is then given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a pressure and energy density of the scalar field , respectively .",
    "therefore , negative value of @xmath4 is crucial for negative pressure , which is the core of our discussion . notice the difference between this case and the usual chaotic potential @xmath41 , where on the average the oscillating inflaton condensate acts as a pressureless fluid .",

    "it is not apparent that the fluctuations in the imaginary direction grows on the top of the pure oscillating homogeneous condensate in the real direction .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , however , self - couplings of the inflaton field are expected to create fluctuations in the imaginary direction as well .",
    "this can be best seen in lattice simulations , which we have done in one , two , and three spatial dimensions . since , all the cases are more or less the same in the qualitative sense , and the resolution of the three dimensional lattices is not so good , we have grounds for believing that the two - dimensional results presented here will also capture the qualitative behavior of the full three - dimensional case . in the context of affleck - dine baryogenesis ,",

    "[ 3d ] . here , we plot the configuration at @xmath101 , just after @xmath0 balls are completely formed .",
    "the typical size and charge of the @xmath0 balls are @xmath102 , which almost coincides with the analytically estimated values , and @xmath103 ( a few ) @xmath104    = 6.5 cm +    therefore , it appears that in running mass inflation @xmath0 balls are produced not only by the negative pressure which makes the homogeneous condensate to fluctuate at the same scale as the @xmath0-ball size , but the mode - mode coupling plays a crucial role in creating locally distributed charge density . in this sense we can state that in a potential such as eq.([qpot ] ) a kind of preheating leads to @xmath0-ball formation .",
    "so far , we have seen it is very natural for the inflaton condensate to deform into @xmath0 balls in a certain inflaton potential such as eq.([qpot ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", it may provide the alternative way of reheating after inflation , namely reheating through evaporation , which leads to slower reheating process than usually considered , as we claimed in ref .",
    "@xmath0 balls in the potential ( [ qpot ] ) are unstable for decaying into particles lighter than @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "if the decay products are pairs of fermions , the decay process occurs only on the surface of @xmath0 balls because of the pauli blocking inside the @xmath0 ball @xcite .    a @xmath0 ball of size @xmath106 forms when the fluctuations grow nonlinear . since the growth rate of fluctuation is @xmath107 , the hubble parameter at the formation time will be estimated as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is some numerical factor derived from numerical simulations .",
    "as we assume that @xmath6 , we can approximate the decrease in the amplitude of the oscillations by @xmath110 as in the matter dominated era , where @xmath111 , denotes the amplitude at the end of inflation in chaotic model , and @xmath112 when the oscillations begin .",
    "therefore , the total charge of a @xmath0 ball is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are numerical factors .",
    "as we shall see below , the evaporating reheat takes over the usual perturbative decay in relatively large coupling where @xmath118 . in this regime , the evaporation rate is saturated by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the surface area of the @xmath0 ball , and @xmath121 .",
    "thus , we obtain the decay rate of the @xmath0 ball through evaporation as @xmath122 note that the decay rate is determined by the ratio @xmath123 , which is fixed by the anisotropies seen in the cosmic microwave background radiation",
    ". therefore , even though we are in relatively large coupling limit , the decay rate mimics that of a planck suppressed interaction of the inflatonic @xmath0 ball to the matter fields .",
    "now let us compare the rate ( [ evap2 ] ) with the perturbative decay rate @xmath124 .",
    "taking the ratio , we have @xmath125 when this ratio is less than unity , the evaporation process from the @xmath0-ball surface suppresses the reheating .",
    "this is achieved if @xmath126 for reasonable parameters , such as @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .",
    "these values of the parameters are derived from numerical simulations on the three - dimensional lattices : @xmath131 , for example . since",
    "the reheating temperature can be estimated as @xmath132 it will be suppressed by a factor @xmath133 for @xmath134 .    in general @xmath4 and @xmath14 are not independent quantities but are related to each other by @xmath135 , where @xmath13 is effective number of bosonic and fermionic loops .",
    "if the inflaton sector does not belong to a hidden sector , it is very natural that the inflaton coupling to other matter fields is relatively large , i.e. @xmath136 .",
    "we can thus have easily a situation where @xmath127 , if , e.g. , @xmath137 and @xmath134 .    to end this section , we will comment on ( fermionic ) preheating @xcite . in the preheating stage , it is very easy to transport inflaton energy into a pair of massless fermions in an efficient way with the maximum physical momentum @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the amplitude of the oscillating inflaton . even though fermionic preheating is efficient ,",
    "the whole inflaton energy is not transferred in this process .",
    "the energy density stored in the fermions remains small compared to the inflaton energy density , i.e. the comoving number density and the energy density of the massless fermions follow @xmath140 the ratio of fermion energy density compared to the inflaton energy density after the end of fermion preheating behaves as @xmath141 hence most of the energy density of the inflaton does not transfer to that of the fermions .",
    "this result is quite robust and remains valid even if the fermions have a non - zero bare mass @xcite .",
    "even if fermions are produced , they can not scatter inflaton quanta off its condensate @xcite , unlike in the case of bosonic preheating with an interaction @xmath142 .",
    "the zero mode of the inflaton thus remains intact as a coherent condensate which will fragment into @xmath0 balls later .",
    "notice that , as mentioned earlier , a @xmath0-ball formation is reminiscent of bosonic preheating due to the presence of attractive self coupling of the inflaton , which stems in the logarithmic term in the potential .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-ball formation appears to be a robust feature of any inflationary model with a potential allowing for a @xmath0-ball solution .",
    "moreover , for a flatter potential , the size of the @xmath0 ball is correlated with the charge , as in the context of the affleck - dine condensate with the gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "this means that the suppression on the reheating will be much more efficient in those cases .",
    "inflaton condensate fragmentation and the formation of lumps may be a rather generic , albeit in many cases a transient feature of preheating . however , for the running mass inflaton with @xmath8 , and possibly for other types of inflation admitting at least temporarily a mass term growing slower than @xmath2 , the final outcome is markedly different from the usual preheating .",
    "the effective equation of state , averaged over field oscillation in the real direction , has negative pressure , which is the cause of the condensate break - up .",
    "if the inflaton happens to be a complex field so that it admits soliton solutions carrying a global charge , one would typically expect an inflatonic @xmath0 and anti-@xmath0 ball pair to be generated when within a @xmath0-ball forming region the field fluctuations in both the real and the imaginary directions exceed the coherent background field value .    to verify the generation of inflatonic solitons",
    "it is not sufficient to follow only the evolution of the field amplitudes . in the real direction",
    "the fluctuations grow very fast to the size of the prospective soliton lumps , but this by itself is not sufficient to ensure @xmath0-ball formation .",
    "indeed , field fluctuations in the imaginary direction do not grow at all in the linear approximations . to see what really happens",
    ", one has to perform simulations in a configuration space on the lattices , as we have done in the present paper .    in our simulations",
    "we can see the formation of lumpy objects but already at relatively early stages when the mean fluctuations in the imaginary direction have not yet develope .",
    "these objects have not become @xmath0 balls yet , but they eventually accumulate charges to become @xmath0 and anti-@xmath0 ball pairs .",
    "we believe that the reason is that there will be large local fluctuations which , once pushed over the limit after which bound solitonic states can exist , can not fluctuate back .",
    "the attractive inflaton self - interaction generates locally distributed @xmath1 charges through mode - mode couplings which then evolve into semi - stable inflatonic @xmath0 balls .",
    "the formation of such solitonic states is non - trivial and stands in contrast to the lumps of the @xmath143 case ; the latter is likely to be an evanescent feature that would merely disintegrate and decay away very fast .",
    "once produced , these @xmath0 balls will decay by evaporation and hence give rise to a `` slow '' reheating because of the suppression which comes from the surface - volume ratio .",
    "in particular , this effect becomes more efficient for rather larger coupling @xmath134 , which might help the disastrous situations such as the gravitino problem in the supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "in fact , the surface evaporation through @xmath0 ball is perhaps the most natural way to obtain low reheat temperatures inspite of having order one inflaton coupling to the fermions , which solves not only the gravitino over - abundance problem but also moduli , and dilaton , especially when the inflationary scale is sufficiently large .",
    "although we have looked upon the running - mass potential , existence of the @xmath0-ball solution is a very generic feature in a certain class of models",
    ". it would be interesting to study whether such inflatonic @xmath0 balls could be seen to arise also in other inflationary models such as hybrid inflation , new inflation , etc .",
    ", and study in these directions are in progress .",
