    "by the end of a student s undergraduate career , the classic harmonic oscillator has appeared in almost every imaginable context .",
    "we see it in introductory physics , as our first example of a spatially varying force , again in a sophomore - level physics class , as a vehicle for studying the fourier transform , and maybe again in a computational physics course , as a model for bonds connecting atoms . aside from its direct utility ,",
    "the equation of motion associated with the harmonic oscillator occurs in a variety of settings , and most instructors refer us back to our earlier experience with masses connected by springs as a way to visualize widely disparate physical systems that have , at their base , the same fundamental equation and solution .",
    "one reason for the central role of the harmonic force is its near - universal applicability  for almost any potential that has a minimum , motion in the vicinity of that minimum is governed by a linear restoring force with a  spring constant \" related to the curvature of the potential at the minimum .    when we move to a relativistic description of simple harmonic motion , that universality is lost .",
    "there is an _ a priori _ ambiguity in the interpretation of a classical force @xmath2 in relativistic dynamics .",
    "it could either appear as a component of a three - force , so that @xmath3 , or it could be a component of a four - force , in which case @xmath4 . in e&m , for example",
    ", the lorentz force is an  ordinary \" three - force ( see p. 519",
    "@xcite ) . for our non - relativistic @xmath5 , we must first determine what type of formulation ( three or four - force ) to use .",
    "however , both of these formulations share the same behaviors in the non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic limits .",
    "indeed , we could argue that correct behavior in these limits is the minimal requirement for a system to be considered a  relativistic spring . \" in fact , we can define an infinite family of equations of motion with the right limiting behaviors to be associated with a relativistic form of hooke s law .",
    "following  @xcite , we will focus on the three / four - force pair associated with @xmath6 .",
    "we ll start by considering the relativistic dynamics of each of these .",
    "if we want either form of the force to correspond , as in e&m , to an interaction of particles with fields , we must introduce a retarded time evaluation .",
    "we proceed to do this for a pair of particles , assuming that the governing field moves at speed @xmath7 in vacuum .",
    "we assume the force depends linearly on the distance between the particles , taking into account the time of flight for the field linking the particles .",
    "this process represents a minimal substitution , in which we effectively replace the instantaneous evaluation of displacement with a retarded - time evaluation . for this modified form",
    "we find a physically implausible growth in oscillatory amplitude .",
    "the pair of particles by themselves no longer constitute an isolated system , and unless we include contributions from the field , we appear to have lost conservation of energy .    this paper is meant to demonstrate the logic and physical checks that are common in high - energy and gravitational model building as applied to a toy system that is familiar from the undergraduate curriculum . in the spirit of demonstration , we take a pair of simple choices ( letting @xmath8 play the role of a component of a @xmath9 or @xmath10-force ) and explore the physical implications of these two systems .",
    "let s start by reviewing the standard problem and its solution . for a mass @xmath11 attached to a spring with spring constant @xmath12 and equilibrium at zero ,",
    "hooke s law combined with newton s second law give the equation of motion : @xmath13 } = -k \\ , x.\\ ] ] if we start with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , then the solution is @xmath16 one immediate ( special relativistic ) problem with this solution is that the speed of the mass , @xmath17 has a maximum value of @xmath18 .",
    "this value can be made greater than @xmath7 for some choice of @xmath19 .",
    "suppose we start by considering the simplest possible equation of motion , given by @xmath20 .",
    "we ll take @xmath21 to be the relativistic momentum , giving @xmath22 } = -k\\ , x.\\ ] ] from this form we can immediately make a qualitative observation about the extreme relativistic oscillatory behavior .",
    "assume the same initial conditions as above .",
    "for @xmath19 large , the force is large , and the mass undergoes rapid acceleration from rest .",
    "but the maximum achievable speed is @xmath7 ( this is enforced by the form of the relativistic momentum appearing in  ( [ n2sr ] ) ) , so the acceleration must die off as the mass approaches speed @xmath7  the larger the initial extension , the faster the value of @xmath7 is attained .",
    "once the mass has travelled to @xmath23 , it is at rest , and the process begins again in the opposite direction . taken to the extreme , the resulting motion looks like a sawtooth , with the mass moving at a constant speed @xmath7 from @xmath19 to @xmath23 , instantaneously reversing direction , and again moving at speed @xmath7 from @xmath23 to @xmath19 .",
    "a physical manifestation of this motion would be light bouncing back and forth between two mirrors .",
    "in fact , any sensible `` relativistic version '' of a spring must have this behavior in the extreme relativistic limit , in addition to behaving like a traditional non - relativistic spring in the opposite limit . aside from details",
    ", we have a clear picture of what must happen : a smooth transition from the non - relativistic sinusoidal motion to the extreme sawtooth motion .",
    "this is already an interesting prediction , since we know that in the non - relativistic limit the period of the motion is given by @xmath24 , a quantity that is independent of the mass s initial conditions . in the extreme relativistic limit ( where @xmath19 is large )",
    ", the period of the motion is @xmath25 , and so is governed _ entirely _ by the initial extension , with no spring information involved .",
    "one interesting consideration is the manner ( as a function of @xmath19 ) in which the system  loses \" its knowledge of the spring .",
    "we will find that the two forms for our equation of motion , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , give different results .",
    "consider a diametric hole drilled through a uniformly charged sphere .",
    "a charged particle moving in the hole experiences a linear restoring force .",
    "the equation of motion is : @xmath28 } = -k \\ , x,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is fixed by e&m constants",
    ". we can isolate acceleration on the left , giving us an equation that can be compared with its newtonian counterpart : @xmath29 starting from rest with extension @xmath19 it is possible to solve for @xmath30 in terms of incomplete elliptic functions  @xcite .    in  ( [ mforce ] )",
    ", we took @xmath31 to be a component of the three - force , so that @xmath32 .",
    "this formulation makes sense for a particle moving in an external harmonic potential , one in which the constant @xmath12 is fixed in the  lab \" frame .",
    "but , we could also let @xmath12 remain fixed in the rest frame of the moving particle  in this case , @xmath27 is the relevant equation of motion , with @xmath8 appearing as a component of the four - force .",
    "we could engineer this case by changing the density @xmath33 in our uniformly charged sphere so as to achieve constant @xmath12 in the instantaneous rest frame of the particle .",
    "defined in the particle rest frame , can also show up in geodesic motion for background metrics that are not flat  @xcite . ]",
    "physical configuration aside , if we move the non - relativistic potential @xmath34 to the lorentz scalar potential @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) , then the ( spatial ) equation of motion would read :    @xmath37 }     = -k \\ , x.\\ ] ]    the form equivalent to  ( [ eomrev1 ] ) is @xmath38    to express both of these options in coordinate time , where @xmath39 is the relevant quantity , we will write these two equations as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the three - force formulation and @xmath43 the four - force formulation .",
    "we now want to explore the details of our two dynamical systems .",
    "this is made clearer by rendering all of our equations dimensionless .",
    "to do so we use the length scale @xmath19 set by initial conditions and the natural time scale @xmath44 ( from section [ nrs ] ) .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath46 so that @xmath14 becomes @xmath47 .",
    "we also define the ratio of initial potential energy to rest energy , @xmath48 , a parameter that governs the size of the relativistic correction .",
    "then our equations of motion become , in order ( i.e.  ( [ fneom ] ) ,  ( [ eomrev1 ] ) ,  ( [ fiieom ] ) ) : @xmath49    we can solve all three equations in  ( [ eomfinal ] ) for various @xmath50  the result of that numerical calculation  , be conserved at one part in @xmath51 . ]",

    "this confirms that both relativistic forms revert to the non - relativistic solution for small @xmath50 , which is also clear from the expressions in  ( [ eomfinal ] ) . as @xmath50 becomes large , both relativistic forms move towards a sawtooth , as they must",
    ".    as expected , the low energy limits of the two trajectories coincide , and the high energy limits , even at @xmath56 , are beginning to converge . however ,  figure  [ fig : motion ] does not present a good way to explore the intermediate regime . the solutions to  ( [ eomfinal ] )",
    "are periodic for all @xmath50 , and we know the period of motion in both limits : the newtonian limit @xmath57 is immediately obvious , and the sawtooth period is @xmath58 .",
    "we can then compare @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( the periods of the motion under the influence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively ) by direct integration .",
    "the equations in  ( [ eomfinal ] ) are all of the form @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "this general form can be integrated once to give @xmath63 for constant @xmath64 . in the case of @xmath65 ,",

    "implies a conserved hamiltonian , however @xmath64 can not be interpreted as the energy . ) , and so it is the generator of time - translation , and a constant .",
    "this provides a formal definition of energy for all values of @xmath21 , even if it does not correspond to one of the familiar cases . ]",
    "if we use the initial conditions ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , appropriate for a particle starting from rest ) to fix the constant , then we can solve for @xmath70 in terms of @xmath71 , yielding @xmath72}^{\\frac{1}{1-p } } \\right)}^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    note that one can also consider  ( [ gencase])-([qpofp ] ) for other values of @xmath21 as they define an infinite family of relevant effective forces .",
    "any suitable relativistic model must have the same non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic limits ( as these do ) , but beyond that , there is freedom .",
    "in addition to the two specific cases of interest to us , a model resulting in @xmath73 was developed from material considerations in @xcite .    using the general expression  ( [ qpofp ] )",
    ", we can integrate over a quarter of a period with definite sign . for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , this gives : @xmath76}\\ ] ] and for @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 ) we have : @xmath79 in both expressions , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds  ] ] .",
    "these two periods , together with the limiting cases ( the sinusoidal newtonian one , and relativistic sawtooth ) , are plotted in  figure  [ fig : periods ] .",
    "we see that the period @xmath60 diverges from the non - relativistic period more quickly , and converges to the relativistic limit more slowly , than @xmath82 ) .",
    "hence the transition between the two limits is more gradual for @xmath60 than for @xmath59 .",
    "the period for any value of @xmath21 should look similar to these , with a different transition from one limit to the other .     for the solutions to  ( [ eomfinal ] )  here , we use @xmath83 to capture a wide range of behavior .",
    "the non - relativistic and relativistic limits are shown in black , the periods under the influence of forces @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shown in gray and dashed gray.,width=384 ]",
    "there is another element to relativistic systems : the question of causality . our model for exploring this",
    "will be a linear ( in displacement ) restoring force with a finite speed of propagation for the interaction .",
    "for concreteness , we will take the form @xmath53 , although the qualitative features of the dynamics produced by @xmath52 and @xmath53 are similar  @xcite .",
    ", as presented here , the force is determined by a static external electromagnetic configuration and therefore there is no issue with the speed of information . ]",
    "we will suppose that underlying the production of @xmath53 is a field that mediates the interaction between two particles as in  figure  [ fig : twoparticles ] .",
    "given material considerations , it would be natural to imagine that field moving between the particles with some fundamental speed @xmath84 , determined by the properties of the supporting medium .",

    "motivated by simplicity , we will start with  ( [ fret ] ) and see what solutions emerge .    if we begin with the stated ( symmetric ) initial conditions and define @xmath100 , then the single equation of motion together with the retarded time definition is @xmath101}\\ , \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\dot x(t)^2}{c^2 } } \\\\ v \\ , { \\left ( t - t_r \\right ) } & = |x(t ) + x(t_r)| . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to get the right - hand side of the equation for @xmath102 in terms of @xmath21 , we must invert the first equation in  ( [ relmomeom ] ) to find @xmath103 as a function of @xmath21 .",

    "the dimensionless factor @xmath113 gives us an additional knob  we can elect to set @xmath114 while maintaining finite relativistic energies ( the @xmath115 limit functions , in the retardation condition , much like the @xmath116 limit ) .",
    "the other limit , @xmath98 is the one on which we will focus on the grounds that : 1 .",
    "we have no physical model with which to fix @xmath84 , and 2 .",
    "using @xmath117 allows multiple solutions to  ( [ vttr ] ) ( since the particles themselves can travel faster than @xmath84 , allowing multiple points of causal contact ) .",
    "this could lead to interesting dynamics , however it is not clear how to weight the effects of the multiple solutions . inspired again by electrodynamics",
    ", we will make the simplifying assumption that our field travels at the speed of light .",
    "we are ready to numerically solve the set  ( [ relspring ] ) for arbitrary @xmath50 .",
    "the method we use to solve the equations of motion in  ( [ relspring ] ) is basically velocity verlet  @xcite , a finite difference approach where we use a fixed grid @xmath118 , and approximate the odes in  ( [ relspring ] ) at these grid points . for the retarded time condition in  ( [ relspring ] )",
    ", we use a root - finding routine ( bisection ) adapted to the grid that will allow us to solve for @xmath109 at @xmath119 up to errors of size @xmath120 .",

    "when the method  ( [ update ] ) is iterated , we generate approximations to the delay differential equation defined by  ( [ relspring ] ) , and the trajectories for a few values of @xmath50 are shown in  figure  [ fig : sigmatraj ] .    ) , shown for increasing value of @xmath50 . in all cases , we use a step size , in  ( [ update ] ) of @xmath121.,width=288 ]    what we see there is amplitude growth : as time goes on , it looks as if energy is being added to the system .",
    "since we are using the relativistic second law , that additional energy makes the trajectory look more and more like a sawtooth .",
    "the result is quite striking , and given that it is a numerical solution , we would like to carry out some analytical tests to confirm the basic behavior .",
    "we will consider two checks , both appropriate for @xmath50 small , where exact results are obtainable . both of these apply to the relativistic case as well .",

    "we can take a continuous trajectory , @xmath131 ( the solution to the non - relativistic problem with instantaneous forcing ) , and calculate both the equal - time spring force , @xmath132 , and the retarded time spring force , @xmath133}$ ] , by solving the retardation condition for this analytic function .",
    "the result is shown in  figure  [ fig : relforce ] where we use @xmath134 .",
    "what we see is that the retarded force is large ( relative to @xmath135 ) as the particle nears equilibrium , so that the mass gets a significant kick near @xmath136 .",
    "then the retarded force diminishes , and the particle continues with less deceleration than it would feel under the influence of @xmath135 .",
    "the process repeats ; each time the particle nears equilibrium @xmath137 gets large compared to @xmath135 and then eases off .",
    "the series of kicks , followed by decreased deceleration force , leads to an overall increase in amplitude .",
    "( in black ) , and the retarded time spring force , @xmath137 ( in gray ) for a sinusoidal trajectory.,width=336 ]    physically , the growth must be caused by whatever is mediating the interaction  in e&m we have fields to transmit the effect of one particle on another , and those fields carry energy .",
    "we have no model for the corresponding mediating  field \" in the retarded spring setting , so we have necessarily excluded its contribution to the total energy ",
    "we then have an  open \" system , which does nt conserve energy .",
    "the description of a relativistic oscillatory system is less universal than its non - relativistic counterpart .",
    "the immediate complication is the identification of @xmath8 as a component of the ordinary , three - force , or the minkowski four - force that provides a starting point .",
    "if a fixed electrostatic source is generating a harmonic potential , then the force we use in the relativistic newton s second law must be @xmath138 where @xmath12 is a constant ( associated with the electrostatic sources ) and @xmath139 is the position of a particle in the lab .",
    "but we could also imagine @xmath8 as appearing in @xmath140 , leading to @xmath141 we see that each is a reasonable candidate if we were to introduce a  hooke s law force \" in the relativistic form of newton s second law ( and there are many others defined by  ( [ gencase ] ) ) .",
    "both forces lead to the same limiting behavior in the low and high energy limits , while differing in the intermediate region .",
    "we can track these changes explicitly by examining the change in period as a function of @xmath50 , the ratio of initial potential energy to rest energy .",
    "we introduced a time of flight delay in the separation @xmath139 appearing in @xmath53 in the simplest possible way .",
    "the resulting retarded force causes amplitude growth which seems non - physical . in a closed dynamical setting of particles generating and responding to fields ,",
    "the force we have introduced would lead to energy loss by the field , but we have no way of performing the accounting that would balance the total energy of the system ( lacking the field portion of the story ) .    aside from developing some effective field with its own dynamics , it would be interesting to introduce damping in the retarded setting to try to tame the amplitude increase ( that damping could come , for example , from radiation reaction if the particles are charged ) .",
    "our goal is to discretize the dimensionless equations of motion  ( [ relspring ] ) , and develop a recursion relation that allows us to move forward in time from the initial conditions .",
    "let @xmath142 and @xmath143 , then from taylor expansion we know that @xmath144 and similarly for @xmath145 .",

    ", we can not achieve equality in  ( [ discretesr ] ) using our fixed grid , so we take the @xmath12 that comes closest to equality . that rounding introduces error @xmath151 in the determination of the retarded time , and hence @xmath151 in the evaluation of the force associated with the position at the retarded time .",
