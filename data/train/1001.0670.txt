    "a degree of stopping of colliding nuclei is one of the basic characteristics of the collision dynamics , which determines a part of the incident energy of colliding nuclei deposited into produced fireball and hence into production of secondary particles .",
    "the deposited energy in its turn determines the nature ( hadronic or quark - gluonic ) of the produced fireball and thereby its subsequent evolution .",
    "therefore , a proper reproduction of the baryon stopping is of prime importance for theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the nuclear collisions .",
    "a direct measure of the baryon stopping is the net - baryon rapidity distribution .",

    "the width @xmath6 of the sources can be interpreted as @xmath8 ( temperature)/(transverse mass ) , if we assume that collective velocities in the sources have no spread with respect to the source rapidities @xmath9 .",

    "an additional condition restricted the total normalization of distribution ( [ 2-sources - fit ] ) to be less than the total proton number in colliding nuclei ( = 164 ) .",
    "this biased fit is the reason why the curve fitted to the new data at 158@xmath0 gev does not perfectly hit the experimental points . in particular , because of this problem we keep the old data at 158@xmath0 gev @xcite in the analysis .",
    "we also use old data at 40@xmath0 gev , corresponding to centrality 7% @xcite , instead of recently published new data at higher ( 5% ) centrality @xcite , since the data at the neighboring energies of 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 and 80@xmath0 gev are known only at centrality 7% @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] is distinctly seen here as a `` zig - zag '' irregularity in the energy dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "it is somewhat suspicious that the `` zig - zag '' irregularity happens at the border between the ags and sps energies .",
    "it could imply that this irregularity results from different ways of selecting central events in ags and sps experiments . however , there are indirect evidences of a physical ( rather than methodical ) nature of this irregularity .",
    "the difference between @xmath13 values in two different experiments at 10@xmath0 gev can be taken as an estimate of the methodical uncertainty .",
    "the difference between @xmath13 values at 10@xmath0 gev and 20@xmath0 gev is two to three times larger than this methodical uncertainty .",
    "moreover , we could expect that @xmath13 at 20@xmath0 gev would be larger than that at 10@xmath0 gev because the incident energy is higher and centrality selection at 20@xmath0 gev is less restrictive ( 7% ) than at 10@xmath0 gev ( 5% ) .",
    "contrary to these expectations the @xmath13 at 20@xmath0 gev is smaller than that at 10@xmath0 gev .",

    "@xcite it was demonstrated that the problem with the low - energy sps data can be solved by considerable softening the hadronic eos .",
    "this softening may indicate an onset of the phase transition into the quark - gluon phase .",
    "notice that a maximum in @xmath21 at @xmath22 gev happens only because the light fragment production becomes negligible above this energy .",
    "the 3fd calculation without coalescence ( i.e. without the fragment production ) reveals a monotonous decrease of @xmath21 beginning from @xmath23 gev , i.e. from the lowest energy considered here .",

    "eos the gibbs construction was used for the mixed phase .",
    "these calculations well reproduce the ags data up to the energy of 6@xmath0 gev , where the purely hadronic scenario is realized . the data at the top sps energy are also reproduced , which is achieved by a proper tune of the inter - fluid friction in the quark - gluon phase .",
    "quality of the reproduction of above data is approximately the same as that with the hadronic eos , as it is , e.g. , seen from figs .",
    "[ fig4a ] and from fig .",

    "[ fig4a ] .",
    "this failure can not be cured by variations of neither the friction nor the freeze - out criterion .",
    "however , the @xmath13 curvature energy dependence in the first - order - transition scenario manifests qualitatively the same `` zig - zag '' irregularity ( fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] ) , as that in the data fit , while the hadronic scenario produces purely monotonous behaviour",
    ". this `` zig - zag '' irregularity of the first - order - transition scenario is also reflected in the midrapidity values of the ( net)proton rapidity spectrum ( fig . [ fig4b ] ) .",
    "as for the experimental data , it is still difficult to judge if the `` zig - zag '' anomaly in the midrapidity values is statistically significant . in the conventional representation of the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig4c ] ) without multiplying by @xmath2 , the irregularity of the @xmath24 data is hardly visible .",
    "however , the conventional representation clearly demonstrates the overall trend of the data : the midrapidity net - proton yield gradually decreases with the incident energy , while the proton one stays approximately constant above the top sps energy . below the top sps energy",
    "the proton and net - proton yields practically coincide .",
    "model computations above the top sps energy are at present not feasible because of high memory consumption required by the code ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "all above discussion concerns only central nuclear collisions .",
    "experimental data on midcentral collisions is much less complete .",

    "eos and 2-ph .",
    "eos .    the baryon stopping depends on a character of interactions ( e.g. , cross sections ) of the matter constituents .",
    "if during the interpenetration stage of colliding nuclei a phase transformation of the hadronic matter into quark - gluonic one happens , one can expect a change of the stopping power of the matter at this time span .",
    "this is a natural consequence of a change of the constituent content of the matter because hadron - hadron cross sections differ from quark - quark , quark - gluon , etc",
    "this can naturally result in a non - monotonous behaviour of the shape of the ( net)proton rapidity - spectrum at an incident energy , where onset of the phase transition occurs .",
    "of course , the first - order transition does not happen abruptly .",
    "within the gibbs construction the fraction of the quark - gluon phase is gradually increasing , as well as weights of the corresponding cross sections .",
    "therefore , a non - monotonous behaviour will show up only if the difference in cross sections in the hadronic and quark - gluon phases is large enough to override the above gradual increase of the fraction of the new phase .",
    "in fact , this is the case in the 3fd calculation with the phase transition ( 2-ph .",
    "the friction in the quark - gluon phase was tuned to reproduce the data at the top sps energy .",
    "naturally , it does not continuously match the friction in the hadronic phase . in terms of parton - parton cross sections",
    ", these cross sections in the quark - gluon phase turn out to be approximately twice as large as those in the hadronic phase . in the quark - gluon phase these cross sections",
    "are compatible with those used , e.g. , in a multi - phase transport model @xcite and a parton cascade model @xcite .",
    "notice that the proton rapidity distribution at 158@xmath0 gev is well described within the color - glass - condensate framework based on small - coupling qcd @xcite .",
    "this mechanism drastically differs from that of hadronic stopping .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the 3fd model requires very different ( from the hadronic one ) phenomenological friction at the 158@xmath0-gev energy to reproduce the data .",
    "however , if even the same friction is used in both phases , the calculated ( with 2-ph .",
    "eos ) reduced curvature still reveals a `` zig - zag '' behaviour but with considerably smaller amplitude ( see the thin dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] ) .",
    "this happens because the eos in a generalized sense of this term , i.e. viewed as a partition of the total energy between kinetic and potential parts , also affects the stopping power .",
    "the friction is proportional to the relative velocity of the counter - streaming nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is more efficient when the kinetic - energy part of the total energy is higher , i.e. when the eos is softer .",
    "this effect of the softening was demonstrated in ref .",
    "it was shown that application of a soft , but still hadronic eos changes the rapidity distributions , making them closer to the data at low sps energies .",
    "this is precisely what the phase transition does : it makes the eos essentially softer in the mixed - phase region .",

    "symbols on the trajectories indicate the time rate of the evolution : time span between marks is 1 fm / c .",
    ", width=309 ]    figure [ fig4d ] demonstrates that the onset of the phase transition in the calculations indeed happens at top - ags  low - sps energies , where the `` zig - zag '' irregularity takes place .",
    "similarly to that it has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the figure displays dynamical trajectories of the matter in the central box placed around the origin @xmath31 in the frame of equal velocities of colliding nuclei : @xmath32 2 fm , @xmath33 2 fm and @xmath34 @xmath27 2 fm , where @xmath27 is lorentz factor associated with the initial nuclear motion in the c.m .",
    "initially , the colliding nuclei are placed symmetrically with respect to the origin @xmath31 , @xmath35 is the direction of the beam .",
    "the @xmath36-@xmath29 representation is chosen because these densities are dynamical quantities and , therefore , are suitable to compare calculations with different eos s .",
    "subtraction of the @xmath37 term is taken for the sake of suitable representation of the plot",
    ". only expansion stages of the evolution are displayed , where the matter in the box is already thermally equilibrated .",
    "the size of the box was chosen to be large enough that the amount of matter in it can be representative to conclude on the onset of the phase transition and to be small enough to consider the matter in it as a homogeneous medium .",
    "nevertheless , the matter in the box still amounts to a minor part of the total matter of colliding nuclei .",
    "therefore , only the minor part of the total matter undergoes the phase transition at 10@xmath0 gev energy .",
    "as seen , the trajectories for two different eos s are very similar at ags energies and start to differ at sps energies because of the effect of the phase transition .",
    "in conclusion , it is argued that the experimentally observed baryon stopping may indicate ( within the present experimental uncertainties ) a non - monotonous behaviour as a function of the incident energy of colliding nuclei .",
    "this reveals itself in a `` zig - zag '' irregularity in the excitation function of a midrapidity reduced curvature of the ( net)proton rapidity spectrum .",
    "notice that the energy location of this anomaly coincides with the previously observed anomalies for other hadron - production properties at the low sps energies @xcite .",
    "the 3fd calculation with the hadronic eos fails to reproduce this irregularity . at the same time , the same calculation with the eos involving a first - order phase transition into the quark - gluon phase ( within the gibbs construction ) @xcite reproduces this `` zig - zag '' behaviour , however only qualitatively .",
    "preliminary simulations with the eos of ref .",
    "@xcite , also based on the first - order phase transition but within the maxwell construction , show the same qualitative trend .",
    "it is argued that the non - monotonous behaviour of the baryon stopping is a natural consequence of a phase transition . the question why these calculations do not qualitatively reproduce the `` zig - zag '' irregularity deserves special discussion elsewhere .",
    "it is very probable that either the gibbs and maxwell constructions are inappropriate for the fast dynamics of the heavy - ion collisions @xcite or the phase transition is not of the first order .",

    "<S> it is argued that the experimentally observed baryon stopping may indicate ( within the present experimental uncertainties ) a non - monotonous behaviour as a function of the incident energy of colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this can be quantified by a midrapidity reduced curvature of the net - proton rapidity spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the above non - monotonous behaviour reveals itself as a `` zig - zag '' irregularity in the excitation function of this curvature . the three - fluid dynamic calculations with a hadronic equation of state ( eos ) fail to reproduce this irregularity . at the same time , the same calculations with an eos involving a first - order phase transition into the quark - gluon phase do reproduce this `` zig - zag '' behaviour , however only qualitatively . </S>"
