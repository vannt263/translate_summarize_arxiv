    "the expansion history of the universe is marked by two characteristic phases , namely , inflation at the early stage and the present longer period of acceleration . in both situations ,",
    "scalar fields are essential ingredients in the construction of cosmological scenarios aiming to describe the evolution of the early and the present universe .",
    "the accelerating phase of the universe requires scalar fields with non - negative potentials playing the role of a cosmological term .",
    "however , potentials taking negative values can not be avoided in cosmological models ( see @xcite for motivations ) .",
    "it is possible for the potential to either exhibit a negative minimum or to be unbounded from below . in these cases",
    ", it is generally believed that the universe eventually collapses even if it is flat .",
    "this feature has been observed in several specific models with negative potentials @xcite-@xcite . in particular , for potentials falling to minus infinity as @xmath1 , heuristic arguments were given in a recent paper @xcite , indicating that a flat initially expanding universe may recollapse .",
    "non - negative potentials with mathematically rigorous results , have been studied by several authors ( see for example @xcite ) , but there is not a corresponding rigorous treatment of negative potentials .",
    "collapsing models were built using homogeneous scalar field solutions in @xcite and the case where a scalar field is coupled to a perfect fluid was studied in @xcite .",
    "the physical reason to understand why the universe eventually collapses when @xmath2 is that in the friedmann equation , @xmath3 the positive energy density of ordinary matter , as well as the positive kinetic energy density of the scalar field , decreases in an expanding universe . at some moment",
    ", the total energy density @xmath4 , including the negative contribution @xmath5 , vanishes .",
    "once it happens , the universe , stops expanding and enters the stage of irreversible collapse @xcite .",
    "of particular importance are potentials having a global positive maximum and negatively diverging as @xmath6 .",
    "these include cosmological models in @xmath7 gauged supergravity @xcite , as well as double exponential potentials studied by several authors double ; double exponential potentials with nonminimal coupling were studied in @xcite .",
    "the physical interest of these potentials is described in @xcite , where it is shown that if initially the field @xmath8 is near the value corresponding to the maximum of the potential , it takes time @xmath9 , until the field rolls down from @xmath8 to the region where @xmath10 becomes negative and the universe collapses .",
    "this time is comparable to the age of our universe , @xmath11 and therefore it is possible that the present universe is into an accelerated phase , yet it will collapse in about 18 billion years . for detailed cosmological implications",
    "see klps , kali , kali1 .",
    "in this paper we study the recollapse problem of scalar - field cosmological models with negative potentials from a mathematical point of view .",
    "we assume that the scalar field is nonminimally coupled to matter ; the coupling coefficient is assumed to be an arbitrary bounded function of the scalar field . for motivation and more general couplings",
    "see @xcite .",
    "inclusion of nonminimal coupling increases the mathematical difficulty of the analysis , yet it is important to consider nonminimal coupling in scalar - field cosmology @xcite . as is stressed in @xcite , the introduction of nonminimal coupling is not a matter of taste ; a large number of physical theories predicts the presence of a scalar field coupled to matter .",
    "we consider a general class of potentials that are free to fall to @xmath12 as @xmath13 , have a global positive maximum and go to zero from above as @xmath14 .",
    "this class of potentials includes the double exponential potentials mentioned above .",
    "we show rigorously that almost always initially expanding flat universes eventually recollapse .",
    "this result does not depend on the particular functional form of the potential .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we write the field equations for flat friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker ( frw ) models as a constrained four - dimensional dynamical system and show a number of preliminary results . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we rigorously prove that a general class of bounded from above potentials with @xmath15 , forces the hubble function @xmath16 to diverge to @xmath0 in a finite time .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is a brief discussion about the classes of negative potentials studied in the literature .",
    "for homogeneous and isotropic flat spacetimes the field equations , reduce to the friedmann equation , @xmath17the raychaudhuri equation , @xmath18the equation of motion of the scalar field , @xmath19and the conservation equation , @xmath20an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the scale factor , @xmath23 , is the hubble function , and units have been chosen so that @xmath24 here @xmath10 is the potential energy of the scalar field and @xmath25 .",
    "ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the coupling coefficient , @xmath28 , is assumed to be a non - negative , bounded from above function , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "interaction terms between the two matter components of the form @xmath29 , as in eq .",
    "( [ conss ] ) , with a simple exponential potential and @xmath30 , were firstly considered in @xcite ( see also bclm , and @xcite where @xmath31 is an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath32 ) .",
    "interaction of the form @xmath29 , appears naturally in scalar - tensor theories of gravity , where @xmath33 is related to the dilaton @xmath34 ( see for example equation ( 1 ) in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite ) , by @xmath35 .",
    "the presence of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor in the right - hand side of equations ( [ ems])(conss ) , implies that there is no energy exchange between radiation and the scalar field .",
    "interaction between radiation and the scalar field is relevant in the warm inflationary scenario @xcite , but since we are interested in the late time evolution of the universe , the case @xmath36 , is not crucial in our analysis .",
    "although there is an energy exchange between the fluid and the scalar field , it is easy to see that the set , @xmath37 is invariant under the flow of eqs . ",
    "; therefore @xmath38 is nonzero if initially @xmath39 is nonzero .",
    "this trivial physical requirement is not satisfied if one assumes arbitrary interaction terms , cf .",

    "the potential has a unique critical point @xmath44 with @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 is a global maximum .",

    "3 .   there exist @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50        potentials of this type include for example double exponential potentials studied in @xcite .",
    "in particular , condition establish a bound for the growth of @xmath51 to infinity , that must be at most exponential .",
    "we will also assume that the function @xmath52 , that is the logarithmic derivative of the dilaton @xmath53 , is bounded for all @xmath54 : in particular , we will suppose the existence of a constant @xmath55 such that @xmath56    the dynamical system  has only two finite equilibrium points , @xmath57 they represent de sitter and anti - de sitter solutions and it is easy to see that are unstable .",
    "it is known that for potentials with a maximum , the field near the top of the potential corresponds to the tachyonic ( unstable ) mode with negative mass squared @xcite .",
    "the other asymptotic states of the system correspond to the points at infinity , @xmath58 .",
    "it can be seen that if initially @xmath59 , then there is a critical value @xmath60 , which allows for @xmath32 to pass on the right of @xmath61 .",
    "more precisely , in the case of zero coupling , @xmath62 it is easy to show that there exists a critical value of @xmath63 , say @xmath64 , such that if @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then @xmath67 remains less than @xmath61  for all @xmath68 .",
    "the argument is similar to the mechanical analog of the motion of a particle in the potential @xmath10 , according to eq . .",
    "in the case of nonminimal coupling , the energy density of the scalar field is not necessarily decreasing , because there is an energy exchange between the scalar field and the fluid .",

    "also for the equilibrium @xmath115 , the result follows , taking some more care due to the fact that , actually , eq . selects a @xmath119dimensional submanifold of initial data , which anyway can be easily checked to be transversal to @xmath121 at @xmath115 .    by the above result one can expect in principle that solutions of the system ",
