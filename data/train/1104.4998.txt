    "the naive analogue of ( 4 ) does not hold  see section [ ssec : tnn ] .",
    "the universal response matrix in the conjecture is the response matrix of the universal cover of the cylindrical network @xmath6 . roughly speaking",
    ", it allows us to not only measure the current flowing through the boundary vertices , but also how many times the current has winded around the cylinder . it may be possible to formulate this in a more electrically natural way by measuring magnetic fields .",
    "thus the key difference between the planar and the cylindrical cases is that even for a critical network on a cylinder the edge conductances may not be uniquely determined from the response matrix .",
    "this non - uniqueness comes from the existence of the electrical @xmath0-matrix , the action of which preserves both the underlying graph of the network and the response matrix , while changing the edge conductances",
    ". the action of the electrical @xmath0-matrix can on the one hand be thought of as a galois group , and on the other hand as a monodromy group .",
    "our second main result is to establish the above conjecture for a certain class of cylindrical networks we denote @xmath11 .",
    "these critical networks can be thought of as the `` purely cylindrical '' networks .",
    "there is no local configuration for which the star - triangle transformation can be applied in @xmath11 , but the electrical @xmath0-matrix generates an action of the symmetric group @xmath12 .",
    "we show in theorem [ thm : sol ] that for the networks @xmath11 the edge conductances are recovered uniquely from the universal response matrix modulo this @xmath12 action , and in particular the inverse problem has generically @xmath13 solutions .",
    "one way to formulate our main conjecture is that the networks @xmath11 exactly encapsulate the difference between the planar and cylindrical cases .",

    "there is a mysterious similarity between electrical networks and a different kind of networks arising in the theory of totally nonnegative matrices . in @xcite",

    ", we suggested in @xcite that a different class of `` electrical lie groups '' is related to electrical networks .",
    "these electrical lie groups are certain deformed versions of the maximal unipotent subgroup of a semisimple lie group .",
    "the main ideas of the present work are also motivated by this analogy , though our philosophy here is more combinatorial in nature .",
    "the construction of the electrical @xmath0-matrix follows the techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "there we constructed , using purely network - theoretic methods , the geometric ( or birational ) @xmath0-matrix of a tensor product of affine geometric crystals for the symmetric power representations of @xmath14 . in this paper , we use electrical networks instead of the `` totally nonnegative '' networks of @xcite , but nevertheless the underlying combinatorics is developed in parallel .",
    "we plan to expand on this analogy in @xcite .",
    "our formulation of conjecture [ conj : gen ] is also motivated by the analogy with total nonnegativity .",
    "indeed , analogues of ( 1)-(5 ) ( and even the missing ( 4 ) ! ) for the _ totally nonnegative part of the rational loop group _ are established in @xcite . in particular , in @xcite we studied in detail from the totally nonnegative perspective , the networks @xmath11 , or more precisely , their medial graphs .",
