    "first , consider a spin model with a known stationary distribution , for example , those used in neuroscience  @xcite , protein evolution  @xcite , or colloidal sciences  @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to infer the best dynamical process that is consistent with a given rate of spin flip .",
    "second , in systems biology , we often know the topology of a network of metabolites , or proteins or regulatory elements .",
    "in addition , `` -omics '' experiments can estimate the abundances of the many metabolites or proteins or regulatory elements at the nodes during the steady - state functioning of a cell .",
    "however , this information alone is not sufficient to explain cell function .",
    "we also need to know the forward and backward rates of fluxes @xmath5 and @xmath6 between all nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , for example in metabolic networks  @xcite .",
    "measuring all these rates is practically impossible at present , particularly for large networks .",
    "third , in structural biology , it is common to perform computer simulations of the conformations of biomolecules and infer markov models among metastable states from those simulations  @xcite . here ,",
    "computing the populations of the states can be done rapidly , whereas computing the kinetic barriers between them is much slower .    in many such problems , the popular approach , especially for large networks ,",
    "is to hypothesize a parametric dynamical model and learn the parameters of this model from data .",
    "often , a large amount of data is required and the parameters learnt are not unique .",
    "we treat this problem as a matter of inference , in the spirit of statistical mechanics , where full distribution functions are inferred from a few measured equilibrium - averaged properties  @xcite .",
    "we provide a solution employing the dynamical analog of the principle of maximum entropy , maximum caliber , seeking the single best model that is consistent with under - determined data .",
    "mathematically , we seek a markovian random walker on a network that has the maximal path entropy and that otherwise satisfies prescribed constraints . towards that goal , we first define a class of walkers that satisfy a ) a prescribed stationary state distribution @xmath7 over the nodes @xmath8 of a network and b ) certain dynamical properties defined over the ensemble of stationary state paths @xmath9 .",
    "examples of dynamical properties include the average distance travelled by the walker per unit time , the average number of reactions per per unit time , or the average number of amino acid changes per unit time in a constantly evolving protein .",
    "below , we first derive the maximum caliber markov process .",
    "we then illustrate its predictive power with two examples , a gene expression network and a network of metastable states of a small peptide .",
    "consider a markovian random walker on a directed network @xmath10 with nodes @xmath11 and edges @xmath12 .",
    "assume that the random walker has a unique stationary state distribution @xmath7 over nodes @xmath13 that is independent of the initial conditions .",
    "the instantaneous probability of the walker being at a node @xmath4 at time @xmath14 , @xmath15 , is governed by @xmath16 where the time independent rate of transition @xmath5 from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 is non zero if and only @xmath17 .    in order to maximize the path entropy , we discretize time into time intervals @xmath18 and at a later time ,",
    "take the limit @xmath19 . in the discrete time scenario ,",
    "the transition rates @xmath5 with units of inverse time are replaced by unitless transition probabilities @xmath20 .",

    "here , @xmath24 is the identity matrix .",
    "let us define an ensemble @xmath9 of stationary state paths @xmath25 of the walker of total duration @xmath26 .",
    "the entropy of this ensemble is @xmath27  @xcite . the time normalized path entropy @xmath28 is @xmath29 the sum in eq .",
    "[ eq : s0 ] is only taken over edges @xmath30 of the network .",
    "all summations below are also restricted to edges @xmath30 unless otherwise stated .      any discrete time markov process with @xmath7 as the stationary distribution and @xmath20 as transition probabilities satisfies two sets of linear constraints ( normalization and stationarity ) .",
    "these constraints are understood as follows : first , from state @xmath31 at time @xmath14 , the system _ has to _ land at one of the states @xmath32 at time @xmath33 .",
    "second , at stationary state , a system in state @xmath32 at time @xmath33 comes from one of the state @xmath31 .",
    "we have , @xmath34 another important constraint is detailed balance , @xmath35 .",
    "below , we will see how detailed balanced constrained can be applied explicitly  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a node - connectivity variable @xmath36 such that @xmath37 , @xmath38 _ if _",
    "the path ensemble average of @xmath36 over all trajectories @xmath39 is given by  @xcite @xmath40 @xmath41 is the mean number of transitions in a single time step @xmath18 .",
    "below we use @xmath41 to take the desired limit @xmath19 in order to convert the discrete time markov chain to a continuous time markov process .    also , we constrain the ensemble average @xmath42 of arbitrary dynamical rate variables @xmath43",
    ". examples of dynamical constraints include the average distance travelled by a particle diffusing on an energy landscape per unit time , the number of spin flips per unit time in a spin glass model , the average number of reactions per unit time , etc .",

    "given that the network is directed , in general we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "thus , if both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are not in @xmath12 , @xmath64 and the connection between @xmath62 can be removed .",
    "consequently , we assume that the network @xmath10 is undirected i.e. @xmath65 and vice versa . imposing detailed balance constraints on transition probabilities",
    "@xmath20 is equivalent to constraining symmetrized forms of the dynamical variables @xmath66 ( see  @xcite for a proof ) . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath69 it is easy to check that eq .",
    "[ eq : main2 ] satisfies detailed balance .",
    "interestingly , the transition rates of a detailed balanced markov process are determined entirely locally from the properties of states @xmath3 and @xmath4 alone and does not depend on the global structure of the network . in contrast , the same transition rate depends on the structure of the entire network when detailed balance is not satisfied ( see eq .  [ eq : omega ] ) .    when we constrain only the mean jump rate ( @xmath70 and zero otherwise ) ,",
    "the transition rates are given by the simple expression : @xmath71 this result should be contrasted with other popular functional forms of the transition rates that satisfy a prescribed stationary distribution , e.g. glauber dynamics  @xcite and metropolis dynamics  @xcite .",
    "for example , historically , glauber developed his dynamics to study magnetic spins  @xcite .",
    "the particular form of the transition rates was motivated by `` a desire for simplicity ''  @xcite . the derivation of square root dynamics presented here , while not resorting to a _",
    "ad hoc _ prescription for transition rates , follows the same intuitive principle i.e. finding the simplest model that is consistent with a given set stationary and dynamical constraints and surprisingly predicts a dynamics that is _ qualitatively _ different from glauber and metropolis dynamics .",
    "our predicted square - root dynamics has an interesting interpretation in theories of chemical reaction rates . in organic chemistry",
    ", so - called _ extra - thermodynamic relationships _ express empirical observations about how the rates and mechanisms of certain types of chemical reactions are related to their equilibria .",
    "these go by the name of the bronsted relation ( often applied to acid - base catalysis )  @xcite , the polanyi relationship for surface catalysis  @xcite , marcus theory for electron transfer reactions in solution  @xcite , or @xmath72-value analysis for protein folding  @xcite .",
    "in short , these approaches express that rates are related to equilibrium constants in the form of @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a variable representing a systematic change , such as a series of different acids of different @xmath75 s , @xmath76 is the equilibrium constants for that series , and @xmath77 are the rates of reaction .",
    "@xmath78 is a value that usually ranges from 0 to 1 , expressing the degree of resemblance of the transition state to the products of the reaction .",
    "now consider a two state system where state @xmath3 are reactants and state @xmath4 are products such that @xmath79 .",
    "we have neglected the population in the transition state since it is much smaller than the state populations at equilibrium .",
    "we have equilibrium constant @xmath80 .",
    "if no dynamical constraints are imposed , the transition rate @xmath5 of the @xmath81 reaction according to the maxcal process is given by @xmath82 .",
    "in short , our maxcal approach predicts that @xmath83 in eq .",
    "[ eq : bronsted ] is the most parsimonious assumption for the reaction mechanism prior to any knowledge of global rate information , implying that the transition state is halfway between reactants and products .",

    "[ eq : omega ] can accurately predict the full chemical master equation ( cme ) from stationary distributions and overall rate parameters . consider a biochemical circuit where two genes are adjacent to a constitutively expressing promoter region .",
    "we assume that the genes are either transcribed individually or simultaneously and that they are degraded individually . in this toy example",

    "the terms correspond to individual synthesis of mrna 1 and mrna 2 , the simultaneous synthesis of both mrnas , and the degradation of mrna 1 and mrna 2 .",
    "we assume that we can experimentally estimate the joint probability distribution @xmath92 of the mrna copy numbers at steady state .",
    "additionally , we also assume that we have two reporters that count the total number of expression events and the total number of degradation events respectively .",
    "note that the reporters are agnostic to which of the two rnas has been synthesized or degraded . with only these three pieces of information , can we estimate the transition rate matrix of the system ?    * ( a ) *      we choose the following parameters for the cme : @xmath93 .",
    "the choice ensures that the number of any of the two mrna molecules is limited to @xmath94 .",
    "this results in a small system size in this proof of principle work where the total number of states is @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ fg : joint_prob ] panels a and b , we show the numerically observed joint distribution @xmath92 .",
    "the correlated pattern of expression is apparent in panel b ; the probability @xmath96 depends on @xmath88 . the higher the value of @xmath88 , the higher @xmath89 values become more probable as a result of the correlated expression .",
    "in the cme , while there are only 5 rate parameters , there are 145 possible transitions .",
    "there are 30 + 30 transitions that correspond to synthesis of mrna 1 or 2 .",
    "there are 30 + 30 transitions that correspond to degradation of mrna 1 or 2 and there are 25 transitions that correspond to simultaneous synthesis of both mrnas .",
    "each transition has its own rate constant but not all rate constants are independent of each other .",
    "for example , the transition @xmath97 has a rate constant @xmath98 and the transition @xmath99 has a rate constant @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , many other transition rates are equal to each other , for example , the rates for transitions that increase the first mrna copy number such as @xmath101 and @xmath102 are equal to @xmath87 and so on .    ]",
    "we find that eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] accurately gives the full 145 rate parameters , without the knowledge of the differential rates of synthesis and degradation of the two mrnas ( see supplementary materials for details of the fitting procedure ) ( see fig .",

    "this infered model is optimal in the maximum caliber sense .",
    "second , we study the equilibrium dynamics of metastable states of a small peptide comprising 7 alanine amino - acid residues .",
    "a metastable state is an ensemble of geometrically and dynamically proximal microstructures that have a significant net population .",
    "classifying protein structures into their metastable states is an active area of research  @xcite .",
    "]    as a test , we compare to previous extensive md simulations of this peptide  @xcite , which led to the identification of 32 metastable conformations  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : simulate ] ) . from that md simulation",

[ eq : main2 ] . in order to guess the functional form of the transition rate matrix , we need to identify a dynamical constraint .",
    "the accuracy of our predictions depends on how well the dynamical constraint captures the diffusion of the peptide on the free energy landscape .",
    "unfortunately , there is no systematic procedure to guess a ` good ' constraint variable .",
    "this is a common aspect of maximum - entropy methods .",
    "see  @xcite for a discussion on the role of constraints in maximum entropy methods .    to guess the dynamical constraint , we make two observations : the transition rate decreases when 1 ) when the average conformational separation between states is increased , keeping the stationary probabilities and the free energy barrier constant and 2 ) when the free energy barrier is increased , keeping the average conformational distance and the stationary state probabilities constant .",
    "as a first guess , we only model the effect of geometric separation and neglect the free energy barrier .",
    "we choose a simple geometric constraint @xmath106 : for any two metastable states @xmath3 and @xmath4 and microstates @xmath74 and @xmath107 such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath106 is the mean distance between a randomly chosen microstate point @xmath74 in metastable state @xmath3 and randomly chosen microstate point @xmath107 in metastable state @xmath4 .",

    "[ eq : main2 ] , the numerically estimated stationary probabilities , and the chosen geometric constraint , we arrive at the functional form of the transition rate matrix @xmath105 .",

    "since @xmath113 and @xmath18 can be combined together , we only needed to determine 2 parameters , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "note that the maximum caliber approach guesses the parametric form of the transition probabilities , one can use any suitable numerical technique and experimental information to estimate the parameters .",
    "since we have access to microscopic data , in this proof of principle study , we used the entire transition probability matrix to fit the two free parameters . using multiple simulated annealing runs to minimize the total error between known and predicted transition probabilities , we found that the best fits were at @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "[ fg : pred ] shows that the rates predicted by the max cal approach quite accurately capture the correct values obtained from the full md simulation , over 5 orders of magnitudes of rates .",
