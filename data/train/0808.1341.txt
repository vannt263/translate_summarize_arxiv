    "although the final stages of the post - main sequence evolution of massive stars do not last long , it is here where most of the mass is lost and the shaping of the pre - supernova ejecta takes place .",
    "key in this respect are the red supergiants ( rsgs ) which represent a phase in the life of stars with initial masses 1030m@xmath2 . during this phase lasting 10@xmath3 years",
    ", the stars lose prodigious amounts of mass at a rate of order 10@xmath4 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 ( van loon et al . 2005 ; massey et al . 2008 ) , and the final mass of the objects is mostly set during this phase .",
    "rsgs have been observed to be the direct progenitors of type iip supernovae ( smartt et al . 2004 ) , but can also evolve towards the blue via a yellow hypergiant phase ( oudmaijer et al .",
    "2008 ; de wit et al . 2008a ) to become a wolf - rayet star and eventually explode as a supernova ( meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",
    "it is not only the study of the stars themselves that helps us understand the final stages of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "investigating rsgs mass - loss and their circumstellar material helps us to understand the origin of the aspherical structures found around supernovae , such as sn 1987a s rings , or gamma - ray bursts .",
    "it is possible that at least some of these observed asymmetries originate during the rsg phase ( e.g. chita et al . 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , in several instances , the mass - loss during the rsg phase has been found to deviate from spherically symmetric , and can have a complex appearance .",
    "much effort has been directed towards the objects vy cma and nml cyg , extremely bright , cool , objects close the empirical humphreys davidson limit ( humphreys & davidson 1979 ) .",
    "high resolution studies have revealed highly anisotropic structures in the wind of vy cma ( e.g. smith et al . 2001 ) , while nml cyg s aspherical appearance is shaped by the strong radiation from the nearby cyg ob2 association ( morris and jura 1983 ; schuster et al 2006 ) .",
    "a third rsg that is found in the same location in the hr diagram as the above two objects is @xmath0 cep ( schuster et al 2006 ) .",
    "contrary to these two cooler objects , little is known about the material surrounding @xmath0 cep . this can be readily explained by its mass - loss , which is orders of magnitude lower than for nml cyg or vy cma ( cf .",
    "jura & kleinman 1990 ) . with an @xmath6 of @xmath79.08 ,",
    "this m2ia star is one of the brightest rsgs known , lying on evolutionary tracks corresponding to stars with initial masses greater than 25 m@xmath2 ( levesque et al . 2005 ) . using levesque et al.s parameters",
    ", we find a distance to the object of 870 pc , and a luminosity of @xmath8 3@xmath9 l@xmath2 . here",
    ", we report on the discovery of an extended dust shell around the object by means of diffraction limited imaging ( 0.6 ) of mid - ir thermal dust emission .",
    "@xmath0 cep was observed on 6 different occasions as a mid - ir standard star between june 2003 and july 2004 with the comics instrument mounted on the 8.2 meter subaru telescope in hawaii ( kataza et al .",
    "2000 ; okamoto et al .",
    "2003 ; sako et al .",
    "the star was imaged using the q24.5-old and q24.5-new filters both centred on 24.5 .",
    "the imaging mode of comics utilises a raytheon 320@xmath10240 si : as ibc array with a pixel scale of 0.13 .",
    "this scale comfortably samples the diffraction limit for the 8.2 m subaru telescope at this wavelength , which is 0.6 .",
    "the observations are summarised in table1 .",
    "more details on the filters and data reduction can be found in de wit et al .",
    "( 2008b , in prep . ) .",
    "@xmath0 cep is bright and therefore often used as a standard star , either for determining the instrumental point - spread - function ( psf ) or for calibrating photometry .",
    "we observed the object for calibration purposes for a different project ( as reported in de wit et al .",
    "2008b ) , and found that it was extended compared to other psf reference stars .",
    "as @xmath0 cep was the psf standard , we do not have a concomitant psf reference observations .",
    "however , we can use as a reference psf the remaining three genuine psf objects observed for the same project : @xmath11 tau and asteroids 51 and 511 . to illustrate the stability of the observational set - up and the extent of @xmath0 cep , we show in fig .",
    "[ obspsf ] the , azimuthally averaged , normalized intensity profiles of the 3 genuine psf standards and those of each of the 6 observations of @xmath0 cep .",
    "the 3 point sources have virtually identical profiles , and the noise begins to dominate only after @xmath84 . on the contrary ,",
    "the profiles for @xmath0 cep are clearly extended with respect to the 3 psf standards to at least 6 , and they are also hardly different from each other on all occasions .",
    "the lowest signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) data of @xmath0 cep ( taken in july 2003 ) also reveal that the object is extended , but the data are not deep enough to probe the extent as well as the higher snr data .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 cep is extended at 24.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the highest snr image ( taken on 04/06/07 ) of @xmath0 cep is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ images ] .",
    "we have subtracted from this image the scaled profile of the psf standard asteroid 511 in order to enhance the features of @xmath0 cep s circumstellar emission . for comparison",
    "we show in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ images ] the psf standard @xmath11 tau with again a psf profile subtracted .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 cep has extended circumstellar emission reaching distances from the star of at least 6 .",
    "the outer parts of the shell - like structure are roughly circular with indications of larger scale inhomogeneities .",
    "in contrast , the inner parts reveal a clearly asymmetric , bipolar type , geometry at a position angle of @xmath867@xmath12 .",
    "the elliptical structure is visible from the inner parts and extends to 2.2  along the major axis on either side of the central star , and 1.4  along the minor axis .",
    "the intensity contrast between the brighter regions and the fainter regions at the same distance from the star is a factor of 2 .",
    "emission at 24.5  stays optically thin for large columns of dust .",
    "resolved images allow us to simultaneously model the dust emission as a function of distance from the star ( the intensity profile ) and the total dust emission as given by the sed . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ dusty , a code that solves self - consistently the scaled 1d dust radiative transfer problem ( see ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) .",
    "we use a spherically symmetric dust distribution , that is illuminated by a central , unresolved star .",
    "its radiation is represented by a kurucz atlas9 atmosphere model ( kurucz 1993 ) with @xmath13 , solar metallicity and surface gravity corresponding to the supergiant nature of @xmath0 cep , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "we use oxygen - rich dust with a condensation temperature of 1000k .",
    "the dust particles follow a mrn size distribution ( mathis , rumple , & nordsieck 1977 ) . within the limitation of a spherical model , we experiment with ( 1 ) the amount of dust as parametrized by the total optical depth @xmath15 ; ( 2 ) the radial density distribution of the dust @xmath16 , adopting a constant ( @xmath17 ) or declining ( @xmath18 ) mass - loss rate ; ( 3 ) two different silicate opacity tables , the ones provided by draine & lee ( 1984 ) and for `` warm '' silicates by ossenkopf et al . ( 1992 ) .",
    "the outer bound of the model is set at 1000 times the dust condensation radius , but the exact value is of little influence on the total excess flux at wavelengths shortward of @xmath825  as long as the outer radius is much larger than the inner dust condensation radius .",
    "we build @xmath0 cep s sed using a mid - ir spectrum taken with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws , de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) on board the iso satellite ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) , near - ir @xmath19 photometry from heske ( 1990 ) and visual broadband @xmath20 johnson photometry from lee ( 1970 ) .",
    "the photometry is dereddened for an interstellar extinction of @xmath21 ( levesque et al .",
    "the iras 60@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m data points lie above the extrapolated iso - sws spectrum .",
    "this excess flux is due to the much larger beam of iras and comes from extended cool dust emission .",
    "the origin of this emission is not obvious , it could be either due to the interstellar medium being heated up by the stellar radiation ( cf .",
    "oudmaijer 1996 ) , or a very extended shell which is the result of a previous mass - loss phase ( e.g. stencel et al . 1988 ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we only consider the most recent mass - loss episode here .",
    "the fit procedure initially estimates the @xmath22 by matching the overall shape of the scaled model sed to the observed one .",
    "dusty s output images are then accordingly scaled and convolved with the instrumental psf .",
    "a comparison of model infrared excess and model intensity profile to the observed ones is made for all generated models .",
    "a simple tally is performed based on a goodness - of - fit criterion .",
    "the model that fits both sets of data best is the one with the highest average ranking in the two tallies .",
    "the results of the 1d modelling are presented in fig.[sed ] .",
    "once the intensity profile is fit for a given nebular structure and stellar luminosity , the sed can be matched by increasing the amount of dust in the given nebula .",
    "the normalized intensity profile is quite insensitive to the total amount of dust for small optical depths .",
    "we chose to prioritize a fit to the slope of the continuum longward of the silicate feature rather than the silicate emission profile .",
    "details for each of the three models presented in fig.[sed ] are given in table1 .",
    "we present the two best - fitting @xmath17 models corresponding to the two different silicate opacities .",
    "the silicate emission feature is not well matched by either model , although the intensity profile is better fit by model # 1 ( full line ) . at the inner",
    "2  the models predict too much intensity , which is consistent with a deviation from spherical symmetry seen in the images",
    ". models with a shallow @xmath18 radial density profile fit the intensity profile worst as is illustrated by model # 3 .",
    "this demonstrates the value of spatial information in this type of analysis , because the sed is at the same time very well matched by model # 3 .",
    "all models have a mass - loss rate of a few @xmath23 for an expansion velocity of @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "le borgne & mauron 1989 ) .",
    "we have presented the first high - resolution ( 0.6 ) images of the circumstellar environment of the rsg @xmath0 cep .",
    "this material has not been seen in previous imaging campaigns . for a sample of massive evolved objects , schuster et al .",
    "( 2006 ) obtained deep optical images with the hst to search for scattered light by circumstellar dust .",
    "they detected only those sources which have mass - loss rates many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath0 cep over the past 5001000 years .",
    "le borgne & mauron ( 1989 ) searched for optical , reflected emission in their polarization data .",
    "these authors made pointed observations with a 10  diaphragm at several locations around the star and detected ( faint ) polarized light as far as 20  from the star .",
    "other evidence for extended emission comes from mauron ( 1997 ) , who finds resonance scattered k i line emission at distances further than 20  from the star .",
    "these data were taken at 2 slit positions , and thus do not allow for conclusive statements about the geometry of the circumstellar matter to be made .",
    "they do appear to indicate the presence of either clumpy material or several discrete mass - loss episodes in the recent past .",
    "the data presented in this paper traces material out to 6 . as an expansion velocity of 10kms@xmath5 at a distance of 1",
    "kpc corresponds to about 1  per 500 yr , the mass lost 20003000 years ago appears to have been ejected in a roughly spherically symmetric way .",
    "however , the most recent mass lost , ejected less than 1000 years ago , shows a pronounced axisymmetric geometry in our high resolution images .",
    ".input parameters and derived quantities of the models presented in fig[sed ] . dl and ow dust types stand for draine & lee ( 1984 ) , and ossenkopf et al .",
    "( 1992 ) silicates .",
    "model # 1 is the preferred model .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : parameters ]    one may speculate whether this geometry is due to a bipolar flow colliding with the spherically symmetric previous wind , or a slowly expanding torus .",
    "it is useful in this respect to consider the current findings for the more numerous lower - mass counterparts of rsgs , the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "data on these are also sparse , but asymmetries of the circumstellar material have been seen at high - resolution in several cases ( e.g. menut et al . 2007 and",
    "murakawa et al .",
    "2005 for irc + 10216 ; vinkovi et al .",
    "2004 and inomata et al .",
    "2007 for irc + 10011 ) .",
    "the picture that emerges from such individual studies is that the outer parts of the agb stars are fairly spherical .",
    "the inner parts are relatively complex , and can be best explained with a torus type structure close to the star , perhaps carved out by a bi - polar flow .",
    "based on a compilation of the best data available , huggins ( 2007 ) finds that , in general , tori correspond to low outflow velocities and jets with higher speeds , in excess of 100kms@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , he concludes that the jets develop shortly after a torus is ejected .",
    "given that the co spectra of @xmath0 cep indicate low velocities rather than high velocities , it is very well possible that we are now witnessing the same for a red supergiant .",
    "we have obtained the first diffraction - limited images of a red supergiant at 24.5@xmath0 m , and resolved the circumstellar material around @xmath0 cep out to 6 . the intensity profile and the sed",
    "were simultaneously fitted with a dust model .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the outer parts of the shell are to first order circular with apparent inhomogeneities , the inner parts , tracing the mass lost in the past 1000 years display a flattened structure , which is possibly a slowly expanding , dense torus . the immediate conclusion from this",
    "is that any asymmetries in the shells of massive evolved stars and supernovae ejecta may find their origins in the red supergiant phase .",
    "this is qualitatively very similar to what is found for the lower - mass agb stars which evolve into bipolar planetary nebulae .",
    "\\2 . the mass - loss rate for @xmath0 cep",
    "is found to be a few times 10@xmath25m@xmath26yr@xmath5 .",
    "this low mass - loss rate may explain the fact that @xmath0 cep is not detected in scattered light , as opposed to other rsgs which have mass - loss rates that are orders of magnitude larger .",
    "a general conclusion is that imaging thermal dust emission at 24.5@xmath0 m is a viable manner to spatially resolve the circumstellar material around evolved objects with low mass - loss rates and as a consequence are otherwise not detected with maser observations , co imaging or scattered light imaging .",
