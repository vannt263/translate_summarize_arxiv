    "nuclear rainbow scattering , which is observed under incomplete absorption , can uniquely determine the interaction potential family up to the internal region without ambiguity @xcite .",

    "although a shallow potential had been used in heavy ion scattering and reactions for many years @xcite , the observation of a nuclear rainbow in @xmath0o+@xmath0o scattering at @xmath2=350 mev finally showed that a global interaction potential for this system is deep @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the global deep potential determined in nuclear rainbow scattering can describe in a unified way not only the prerainbows and the airy structure in the 90@xmath4 excitation function , but also the molecular resonances in the low energy region and the band structure with the @xmath0o+@xmath0o cluster structure .",

    "<S> the airy structure in @xmath0o+@xmath1c rainbow scattering is studied with an extended double folding ( edf ) model that describes all the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling potentials derived from the microscopic realistic wave functions for @xmath0o using a density - dependent nucleon - nucleon force . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental angular distributions at @xmath2=132 , 281 and 382.2 mev are well reproduced by the calculations . by studying the energy evolution of the airy structure , the airy minimum at around @xmath3=76@xmath4 in the angular distribution at @xmath2=132 mev </S>",
    "<S> is assigned as the second order airy minimum @xmath5 in contrast to the recent literature which assigns it as the third order @xmath6 . </S>",
