    "( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) have reported intriguing alignments of polarization vectors of quasars at optical wavelengths .",
    "the presence of these alignments may possibly be in tension with the well - accepted concordance model of cosmology as they involve correlations between sources separated by comoving distances at the gpc - scale .    paying particular attention to instrumental biases , @xcite compiled the jvas / class 8.4-ghz sample of flat - spectrum radio sources ( fsrs ) with polarization position angle ( pa ) measurements .",
    "as they have shown , rotation measures of the polarization vectors induced by faraday rotation at 8.4 ghz are too small to destroy information about the intrinsic pa s .",
    "therefore , any observed correlation of pa s among sources can be thought to be intrinsic to the sources themselves .",
    "extracting from this sample 4290 fsrs s with polarized flux higher than 1 mjy , @xcite searched for systematic alignments of radio polarization vectors of the type reported at optical wavelengths by hutsemkers and collaborators , i.e. at cosmological scales",
    ". their analysis did not reveal such large - scale alignments at radio wavelengths .",
    "from this claim , the recognized wavelength dependence of the polarization vector alignments has brought the model of axion - like particle ( e.g. @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite ) as the favourite candidate to explain alignments at optical wavelengths .",
    "this model has however been observationally ruled out since it predicts non - negligible circular polarization which is not detected ( @xcite and @xcite ) .    beside this analysis , @xcite tested the uniformity of the polarization pa s considering roughly the same sample .",
    "they found significant evidences for alignments at distance scale of the order of 150 mpc .",
    "as the correlations are found at different distance scales , their study does not contradict the analysis of @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied the correlation of the pa s for sources grouped in circular regions of @xmath2 radius . while not very significant , he reported indication of pa s alignments in two regions of the sky .    despite these analyses which involve different statistical tests and different samples which correspond to different cuts of the original dataset , the status of polarization pa correlation at radio wavelengths in not clear .",
    "moreover , an analysis taking the redshift of the sources into account in still missing .",
    "the redshift dependence being an important characteristic of the alignments of quasar polarization vectors at optical wavelengths , it seemed important to us to take it into account in the analysis of the radio sample . especially if one seeks the same signature at radio wavelengths as at optical wavelengths .",
    "therefore , originally motivated by the redshift dependent analysis of this radio sample on the one hand , and by the recent and independent confirmation by @xcite of the polarization alignments at optical wavelengths , on the other hand , we devote this study to a careful analysis of the uniformity of the polarization pa s of fsrs s belonging to the jvas / class 8.4-ghz surveys .",
    "we introduce the data samples which are studied throughout this work in section  [ sec : datasample ] . in section  [ sec : visiblewindows ] , taking the redshift of the sources into account , we investigate the polarization pa distributions of the fsrs s located in regions of the sky where the optical polarization alignments are the most significant .",
    "stimulated by the detection of alignment in one of these regions , we perform a complete analysis of the entire dataset in section  [ sec : uniformity_in_jvas ] , with and without accounting for the redshift .",
    "having highlighted significant alignment signatures in the sample of quasars ( hereafter , qso ) , we search for their characterization in section  [ sec : identifregions ] .",
    "we finally summarize our results in section  [ sec : discussionfinal ] , bring arguments against and for the hypothesis of biases in the dataset and discuss a possible interpretation of the data .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] that the dataset of the polarization angle measurements of the jvas / class 8.4-ghz surveys are either not exploitable due to instrumental biases or , more excitingly , that we may have pinpointed large - scale alignments at radio wavelengths . as we use little",
    "known statistical tests throughout this work , we found necessary to discuss them .",
    "thereby , the descriptions are brought together in the appendix in order to keep a fluent reading .",
    "the jvas / class 8.4-ghz catalogue is made of the jvas ( jodrell - vla astrometric survey ) and the class ( cosmic lens all - sky survey ) surveys that were gathered by @xcite to build the largest catalogue of polarization measurements of compact radio sources , at that time , paying attention to biases on polarization measurements .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for a complete description of the catalogue and the surveys . in this catalogue ,",
    "the total number of object having polarization measurements is @xmath3 ( see the on - line catalogue ) . adopting the prescription of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we retain the sources for which the polarized flux is higher or equal to 1 mjy in order to keep significant polarization detections only and to obtain an unbiased sample . when there is more than one object in a radius of 1 arcsec on the sky , we select the object with the highest polarized flux .",
    "this selection , which also eliminates multiple measurements , leaves us with a sample size of @xmath4 objects studied by @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless choose to add the above constraint for an efficient source separation . ] .",
    "led by a selection criterion used at optical wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) , we further constrain the sample asking that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the error on the polarization pa . out of the @xmath4 sources",
    ", @xmath0 satisfied the criterion .",
    "this sample , which we call @xmath7 in the reminder , constitutes the largest sample for which we have robust polarization pa measurements from the jvas / class 8.4-ghz surveys .    using the nasa extragalactic database ( ned )",
    ", we identified a total of @xmath8 sources .",
    "we first used the automated mode `` near - object / position list '' with a search radius of @xmath9 arcsec .",
    "after manual clarification of multiple identifications , @xmath10 objects were found .",
    "for the @xmath11 objects left , we used a search radius of @xmath12 arcsec and found @xmath13 additional sources , after having again manually clarified the multiple identifications . we stopped the procedure at this value of the search radius in order to ensure proper identifications .",
    "out of the @xmath8 retrieved objects , @xmath1 have spectroscopic , and thus reliable , measurements of redshift , @xmath14 .",
    "the use of ned also leads to the classification of the sources .",
    "table  [ tab : ned_classification ] reports the number of sources identified for each class of fsrs as well as the number of these sources for which we have redshift information .",
    ".the different samples . [ cols=\"<,<,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "so far we found that the polarization vectors of qso s being in groups having angular radius of about @xmath15 have correlated orientations .",
    "we showed that these groups cluster in three independent regions of the sky and that to each of these corresponds a different preferred polarization pa .",
    "the preferred angles for the two northern regions are found to have values close to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these values , being very particular , lead us to consider the possibility that the correlations we found are due to biases in the dataset ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this hypothesis , being a priori difficult to reconcile with the local character of the alignment features , could potentially explain that they are better detected with the 2-dimensional analysis than with the 3-dimensional one . in this sense , and contrary to what @xcite and @xcite claimed , we also find evidence for a global non - uniformity inside the polarization dataset . using the hawley ",
    "peebles test , the probability that the distribution of the @xmath0 objects is uniform is found to be @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) .",
    "this non - uniformity of the overall polarization distribution of the sample @xmath7 argues for the hypothesis of a biased dataset .",
    "however , consistently with our previous results , this non - uniformity is found to come from the sub - category of qso as we find @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) for this sample and that removing the qso s from the sample @xmath7 leads to @xmath22 is also in good agreement with uniformity ( @xmath23 ) . ] .",
    "this result together with the previous evidence for alignment of qso s and not for the other species is awkward to reconcile with an observational bias , as there is no reason for a contamination of the polarization data for the species of qso and not for the others , as we shall see .    comparing the properties of the samples @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( which have a comparable number of objects ) , we note some differences . as illustrated by the fig .",
    "[ fig : qso - vs - rs - lightpropeties ] , their polarization characteristics at radio wavelengths do not follow the same parent distribution .",
    "however , we do not find obvious reasons why the sample @xmath24 would be more affected by observational biases than the sample @xmath25 as the qso sample shows higher total and polarized flux .",
    "the distribution on the sky of the two samples is also different .",
    "while the sample @xmath24 is almost homogeneously distributed over the sky , the sample @xmath25 is far from being so .     and @xmath25 . a two - sample kolmogorov",
    "smirnov test reveals that the polarized flux , as well as the degree of linear polarization , of the two samples have a probability much below @xmath26 to be drawn from the same underlying parent distribution . ]    in order to test the possibility that it is the difference of sky distribution that is responsible for the detection of alignments for @xmath24 and not for @xmath25 , we test the uniformity of the polarization pa of the rs s belonging to the regions of alignments of table  [ tab:1450_identif-2d ] .",
    "the overlap is very poor for the regions in the north galactic hemisphere : only @xmath27 rs s are found in each of the rn1 and rn2 regions . to the south , however , there are @xmath28 rs s in the rs1 region .",
    "the hawley ",
    "peebles test does not reveal departure from uniformity , neither taking rs s alone or mixing them with the qso s of this region ) . ] .",
    "therefore , while the bad overlap between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 samples in the northern regions could explain the difference in the alignment detection , this is not the case to the south .",
    "we thus conclude that the difference of sky distribution is unlikely responsible of this difference .    similarly to an instrumental bias",
    ", contamination by foreground polarization would affect more strongly the sample of rs s than the one of qso s as the polarized flux is globally smaller for @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qso - vs - rs - lightpropeties ] ( top ) ) .",
    "this is again in contradiction with what is observed .",
    "the contamination by foreground polarization is thus unlikely responsible for the observed correlations of the polarization pa s of qso s .",
    "as polarization is usually correlated to the morphological axis of the object ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , there might be real differences between the classes of qso and rs .",
    "indeed , the core dominated fsrs s are predominantly quasars or bl lac objects in which the jet is oriented close to the line - of - sight ( see * ? ? ? * ) . the majority of the sources belonging to the sample @xmath25 is thus expected to be bl lac objects which are thought to be viewed at very small angles to the line - of - sight",
    "consequently , they are expected to show rapid variations ( @xmath29 years ) of their polarization pa and to be more strongly polarized than quasars , which is what we observe in fig .  [",
    "fig : qso - vs - rs - lightpropeties ] ( bottom ) .",
    "also , for this class of object , no net correlation between the jet orientation and the polarization pa has been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these observational facts could bring an explanation to the absence of alignment signatures for the sample of rs s within the hypothesis that polarization alignments reflect morphological - axis alignments of the sources , as supported by the recent discovery at optical wavelengths of such correlation for one of the most largest known quasar group at @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the latter hypothesis is also reinforced by the discovery of large - scale alignments of the jet position angles of active galactic nuclei in the elais n1 field by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that radio and optical alignments are found in the same parts of the sky also supports a real effect . in this framework",
    ", one would have to compare the alignment patterns observed at optical wavelengths with these at radio wavelengths .",
    "however , given the bad overlap between the sky coverage of the radio and optical catalogues , a detailed comparison is not straightforward .",
    "we tested the hypothesis that the polarization position angles are randomly distributed among the fsrs s contained in the jvas / class 8.4-ghz surveys presented in @xcite .",
    "we performed the analysis in two and three dimensions , accounting for the distribution of the sources on the sky ( 2d ) and additionally for their line - of - sight comoving distances ( 3d ) .",
    "the polarization orientations of radio quasars ( @xmath24 sample ) show low probabilities to be consistent with the hypothesis of randomness .",
    "this departure from uniformity is likely due to correlations of polarization vectors of qso s in groups of angular radius of about @xmath15 .",
    "a basic identification procedure showed that these groups cluster in three distinct regions of the sky .",
    "two of them fall in the a1 and a3 windows of the sky where optical polarization alignments were found ( hutsemkers et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) . among sources in the jvas / class sample , only the class of qso exhibits such large - scale correlations .",
    "if real , such alignments at radio wavelengths would support the interpretation of alignments at optical wavelengths by spin - axis alignments @xcite . however , our findings prove to be difficult to interpret either as resulting of biases in the dataset or as being the signature of a physical effect .",
    "indeed , one can find arguments for and against each scenario . among them ,",
    "the fact that the alignments are more pronounced in 2d than in 3d and that the mean pa s are multiple of @xmath16 in some regions would suggest a biased dataset whereas the detection of alignments for one class of object but not for the others and the clustering of aligned sources in a few regions of the sky consistent with those found at optical wavelengths might be seen as the signature of a physical effect .    in conclusion",
    ", we highlighted correlations between the radio - polarization vectors of quasars which could demonstrate the presence of the same kind of alignment effect as seen at optical wavelengths , or alternatively , which could demonstrate that the radio polarization catalogue is affected by observational biases and thus can not be used to study the polarization orientations of flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "therefore , the claim by @xcite stating that , at radio wavelengths , there is no alignment signature of polarization vectors on cosmological scales of the type found at optical wavelengths should be seen with caution .",
    "more data are clearly needed to assess either the reality of polarization alignments at radio wavelengths or the presence of residual biases in the jvas / class 8.4-ghz radio polarization samples .",

    "[ appendix ]",
    "to investigate the polarization pa correlations and to address the question of uniformity of their distributions , we use several statistical tests in this paper .",
    "these are the fourier method of @xcite , the density test of @xcite and the s and z tests of @xcite . for the sake of completeness and",
    "as they are little - known tests , we hereafter present a brief description of those .      the hawley ",
    "peebles test @xcite is one of the common methods used to study the alignments of galaxies .",
    "it is based on fitting the observed distribution of pa s by a model of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean of the number of objects per bin and @xmath33 is the observed number of objects in the bin centred in @xmath34 . the number of bins is a free parameter . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the coefficients of the wave model which describe the degree of deviation of the distribution from being uniform . if the pa s are not uniformly distributed the mean position angle is given by @xmath37 .",
    "a good measure of departure from uniformity is the total amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "as easily understood , the bigger the value of @xmath39 , the less uniform the distribution .",
    "the probability that the total amplitude exceeds by chance a given value of @xmath39 is computed to be approximately @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of objects in the sample .",
    "however , as far as small samples are considered , random simulations are required as the distribution of @xmath39 differs from a normal gaussian and as this approximate relation fails far out in the wings ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) . for the simulated samples , polarization pa s",
    "are uniformly generated and distributed among the sources .",
    "the probability @xmath42 is then simply given by the percentage of random realizations having a @xmath39 value higher or equal than that of the data . in this work ,",
    "we tested all reported probabilities using random simulations and we only found marginal differences compared to those given by the approximate relation .",
    "these are actually smaller than the variations caused by the choice of the number of bin .",
    "we decided to report only the probabilities computed through the gaussian approximation .",
    "it is worth to mention that this statistical test is also dependent of the coordinate system in which pa s are defined .",
    "however , as we use this test to study the uniformity of the polarization pa distributions inside relatively small regions of the sky and that the declinations of these regions are not too high , the changes are expected to be small .",
    "the intrinsically coordinate - invariant statistical test developed in @xcite introduces a polarization space ( a 2-sphere ) and treats polarization as points on it .",
    "the study of the density of these points allows a direct highlight of the direction for which an unexpected over - density is observed . for a given sample of sources a preferred direction",
    "is thus automatically allocated , to which corresponds a semi - analytically computed probability . this _",
    "probability , denoted by @xmath43 and being the p - value of a poisson - binomial distribution , gives the likelihood that the observed density toward the given direction is due to chance , i.e. assuming a uniform distribution for the polarization pa s .",
    "a _ global _",
    "probability , computed through monte carlo treatment , is also introduced and is denoted by @xmath44 . for a given sample , this global probability answers the question of the likelihood of a detected significant over - density without concern of its direction .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a complete description of this new test and for a discussion .",
    "note however that throughout the study of the density of polarization points on the sphere , spherical caps having half - aperture angle @xmath45 are used .",
    "this angle is the only parameter of this test and is strongly related to both the sky distribution of the sources and the strength of the alignment of the polarization vectors .",
    "it is therefore necessary to explore a large range of value of @xmath45 .",
    "however , as this is the case with the bin width value for simple binomial tests on histograms , this method undergoes edge effects .",
    "a search for the very optimal value of @xmath45 is therefore ambiguous .    during our analysis",
    "( e.g. in section  [ sec : visiblewindows ] ) we report the mean position angle @xmath46 for a given distribution . it is computed with respect to the spherical basis vectors @xmath47 at the location given by the normalized vectorial sum of the source positions .",
    "this quantity has a meaning only when the maximum angular separation between studied sources is not large and when the position angle distribution is not uniform .",
    "the s test was developed by hutsemkers ( 1998 ) in order to detect and statistically characterize the alignment features of polarization vector orientations which were first visually detected .",
    "this test is based on dispersion measures of pa s for groups of @xmath48 neighbouring sources among the sample . for each object ,",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is computed , where the @xmath50 s are the polarization pa s of the objects of the group , including the central one , in degree . for the object @xmath51 , the mean dispersion of the pa s of the @xmath48 objects",
    "is computed to be the minimum value of @xmath52 and is denoted @xmath53 . if @xmath41 is the size of the whole sample under consideration , the statistic with the free parameter @xmath48 is defined as @xmath54 @xmath55 measures the concentration of angles for groups of @xmath48 objects close to each other in space ( in 2 or 3 dimensions , as we shall see later ) .",
    "if the polarization vectors are locally aligned , the value of @xmath55 will be smaller than in the case where the pa s are distributed following a uniform distribution on the objects .    the significance level ( s.l . )",
    "to which one may assign the observed alignment to chance is evaluated through simulated datasets .",
    "those are created by generating pa s according to a uniform distribution or by shuffling the observed pa s among the sources of the sample .",
    "this second procedure is found to be more appropriate to the detection of correlations between polarization pa s and the source locations ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "this procedure is chosen in this work each time we resort to dataset generation for the s and z tests .",
    "the percentage of simulations with a value of @xmath55 lower than that of the data gives the s.l .",
    "i.e. , the probability that the distribution of position angles is due to chance .",
    "the z test is a non - parametric test originally introduced by andrews & wasserman @xcite to quantify the correlation between the pa s and the position of sources on the sky .",
    "its basic idea is to compute for each object @xmath51 , the mean direction @xmath56 of its @xmath48 neighbours , excluding this time the central object @xmath51 , and to compare this local average to the actual polarization pa of the object @xmath51 , namely , @xmath34 .",
    "specifically , the pa s of the @xmath48 nearest neighbours around each object @xmath51 but excluding the latter , are used to computed the mean resultant vector @xmath57 where the factor @xmath58 accounts for the axial nature of the polarization . the mean direction @xmath56",
    "is given by the normalized mean vector @xmath59 through @xmath60 a measure of the closeness of @xmath34 to @xmath61 is the inner product @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "if the pa s are correlated to the source positions , then , on average , @xmath34 will be closer to @xmath64 than to @xmath65 which , in turn , implies @xmath66 to be larger for @xmath67 than for @xmath68 .",
    "an approximately normally distributed statistic @xmath69 is computed from these quantities as follow ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and where @xmath72 is the rank of @xmath73 , when the @xmath74 s are sorted in increasing order and @xmath41 is the size of the studied sample .",
    "as correlations of pa s with source positions induce large @xmath73 , @xmath69 is expected to be larger than zero if polarization vectors are coherently aligned .    despite the fact that the @xmath69 statistic is approximately normally distributed ,",
    "simulations are needed to evaluate the s.l . because of the mutual dependence of the @xmath74 , especially for large values of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , as for the s test , the s.l . is given by the percentage of simulations that show greater value of @xmath69 than the one corresponding to the observations .",
    "a modification of the andrews & wasserman test was proposed by @xcite . instead of considering the inner product with @xmath75",
    ", he proposed to compute @xmath76 .",
    "this definition gives more weight to the groups of sources having similar pa values .",
    "indeed , aligned polarization vectors imply a large norm of @xmath77 which provides a natural measure of the dispersion of the position angles and leads to a large @xmath66 .",
    "apart from this variation , the modified statistic is computed in the same way as the original test of andrews & wasserman . in this work , we use this modified version when we refer to the z test as it is more sensitive to local alignments and thus , more adapted to the search for such features .",
    "the pa s of quantities which are transverse to the line - of - sight to their corresponding sources , i.e. projected in the planes orthogonal to these directions , are dependent of the coordinate system in which the source positions are reported .",
    "as the changes of pa values depend on the source positions , results of statistical tests change from coordinate system to coordinate system .",
    "in order to overcome this coordinate dependence , @xcite modified the s and z tests introduced above .    instead of computing statistics",
    "directly from the pa s each evaluated with respect to their own meridian , they introduced correction to the pa s that involves the relative sky positions of the sources . in order to compare in a coordinate - invariant manner the pa s of two sources separated on the celestial sphere , @xcite did parallel transport the polarization vector of one source to the other .",
    "the parallel transport is performed along the sphere geodesic passing through the positions of the two sources .",
    "the idea is thus to add a correction term to the pa values , this correction being simply the difference between the angles that forms the geodesic with one of the basis vectors at the locations of the two sources .",
    "therefore , while evaluating eq .",
    "[ eq : d_theta ] or eq .",
    "[ eq : y_i ] for each central object @xmath51 , the polarization pa s of the @xmath48 neighbouring sources are transformed as @xmath78 where each @xmath79 is the correction due to the parallel transport of basis vectors from the position of the source @xmath80 to the position of the source @xmath51 ( see * ? ? ? * for further details ) .        in both s and z tests ,",
    "the number of nearest neighbours @xmath48 is a free parameter which has to be explored .",
    "indeed , this parameter is not devoid of physical meaning as it is related to a characteristic scale of the nearest neighbouring groups , in two or three dimensions .",
    "this would be strictly true for a sample uniformly scattered across the whole sky . as the observed samples show deviations from homogeneity and , more importantly , as only a part of the entire celestial sphere",
    "is covered , this parameter does not show a straight correspondence with a typical size of groups . a dispersion is naturally expected .",
    "nevertheless , if correlations between polarization orientations occur for a typical scale or if some sub - samples well delimited -in space- present such alignments , it is clear that the s.l .",
    "will be smaller for the corresponding value of @xmath48 than for others .",
    "therefore , to test the uniformity of the polarization orientations and explore their characteristics , it is necessary to estimate the s.l . across a wide range of values of @xmath48 . to build the groups of nearest neighbouring objects , the relative distances between sources",
    "is required . for this purpose , and assuming a flat and isotropic universe , we consider the line - of - sight comoving distance @xmath81 to the observer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in agreement with @xcite , our calculation",
    "are made with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the relative distances between sources are then simply computed through the use of their rectangular coordinates and the groups of nearest neighbours constructed .",
    "a three dimensional analysis is obviously only feasible for samples for which redshift measurements are available .",
    "nevertheless , a two dimensional one , considering nearest neighbours on the celestial sphere rather than in the 3d space , is not devoid of interest and is applicable for all samples imposing @xmath84 ."
