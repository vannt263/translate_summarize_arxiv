    "the notion of zero - error capacity was introduced by shannon in 1956 to characterize the ability of noisy channels to transmit classical information with zero probability of error @xcite . since shannon s seminal work",
    ", the study of this notion and the related topics has grown into a vast field called _ zero - error information theory _ @xcite .",
    "the main motivation is partly due to the following facts : ( 1 ) in many real - world critical applications no errors can be tolerated ; ( 2 ) in practice , the communication channel can only be available for a finite number of times ; ( 3 ) deep connections to other research fields such as graph theory and communication complexity theory have been established @xcite .",
    "these works indicate that unlike the ordinary capacity , computing the zero - error capacity of classical channels is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem about graphs , and is extremely difficult even for very simple graphs . despite the fact that numerous interesting and important results have been reported ( see @xcite for an excellent review ) , the theory of zero - error capacity is still far from complete even for classical channels .",
    "the generalization of zero - error capacity to quantum channels is somewhat straightforward but nontrivial as the input states of the channel may be entangled between different uses , and the information transmitted may be classical or quantum .",
    "at least two notions of zero - error capacity of quantum channels exist : one is the zero - error classical capacity , the least upper bound of the rates at which one can send classical information perfectly through a noisy quantum channel , denote @xmath2 .",
    "if replacing classical information with quantum information in the definition of @xmath2 , we have another notion @xmath3 , the zero - error quantum capacity .",
    "a careful study of these generalizations will not only help us to exploit new features of quantum information , but also be useful in building highly reliable communication networks .",
    "the notion of @xmath3 has been extensively investigated in the context of quantum - error correction . in this paper",
    "we mainly focus on @xmath2 of which little was known .",
    "a few preliminary works have been done towards to a better understanding of the zero - error classical capacity of quantum channels . in particular ,",
    "some basic properties of @xmath2 of quantum channels were observed in @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown that the zero - error classical capacity for quantum channels is in general also extremely difficult to compute  @xcite . however , in these works the only allowable input states for channels were restricted to be product states and entangled uses of the channel were prohibited .",
    "consequently , many of the properties of this notion is similar to the classical case and it was not clear what kind of role the additional quantum resources such as entanglement will play in zero - error communication .    in a recent work it was demonstrated that the zero - error classical capacity of quantum channels behaves dramatically different from the corresponding classical capacity @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that in the so - called multi - user communication scenario , there is noisy quantum channel of which one use can not transmit any classical information perfectly yet two uses can . to achieve this , one needs to encode the classical message using entangled states as input and thus to make two uses of the channel entangled .",
    "this is a purely quantum effect that can not happen for any classical channels .",
    "furthermore , it can not be observed under the assumptions of refs .",
    "@xcite where only product input states between different uses are allowed .",
    "one drawback of the channel constructed in @xcite is that we have at least two senders or two receivers and require the senders or the receivers to perform local operations and classical communication ( locc ) only .",
    "this locc restriction is a reasonable assumption in practice as it captures the fact that the quantum communication among the senders or the receivers would be relatively expensive .",
    "if this local requirement is removed , one use of these channels are able to transmit classical information perfectly .",
    "thus a major open problem left is to ask whether there is quantum channel with only one sender and one receiver enjoying the same property .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further develop the theory of zero - error capacity for quantum channels .",
    "our first main result ( theorem [ th1 ] ) is an affirmative answer to the above open problem .",
    "more precisely , we show by an explicit construction that there does exist quantum channel @xmath4 with one sender and one receiver such that one use of @xmath4 can not transmit classical information perfectly while two uses of @xmath4 can transmit at least one bit without any error . fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] demonstrates our construction . in our construction we do nt construct @xmath4 directly",
    "instead , we construct two quantum channels @xmath5 and @xmath6 such that both of them can not transmit classical information perfectly by a single use while can transmit at least one bit if employed jointly .",
    "this confirms the usefulness of entangled input for perfect transmission of classical information .     is a noisy quantum channel from alice to bob .",
    "with one use of @xmath4 , alice can not transmit classical information to bob perfectly .",
    "interestingly , by using @xmath4 twice , alice can transmit a classical bit ",
    "@xmath7 \" perfectly to bob . to do so",
    ", alice carefully encodes the bit  @xmath7 \" into a bipartite entangled state @xmath8 and applies @xmath4 twice . by decoding the output state @xmath9",
    ", bob can perfectly recover the bit  @xmath7 \" . ]",
    "similar to the previous work @xcite , our main tool is the notion of unextendible bases ( or equivalently , completely entangled subspaces ) @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in our construction is to partition a bipartite hilbert space into two orthogonal subspaces which are both completely entangled , or equivalently , unextendible .",
    "this kind of partitions has been found before @xcite and has been demonstrated very useful in quantum information theory@xcite",
    ". however , all these previous partitions are not sufficient for our purpose .",
    "additional requirements make the construction rather difficult and tricky .",
    "our second main result ( theorem [ th3 ] ) is to show that both the zero - error quantum and classical capacities of noisy quantum channels are strongly super - additive .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a class of special quantum channels which can be treated as the generalizations of retro - correctible channels @xcite .",
    "it was known that the zero - error capacity of classical channels are super - additive in the following sense @xcite : there are @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "this is very different from the ordinary classical capacity of classical channels , which is always additive .",
    "however , any classical channels @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfying the super - additivity must have the ability to transmit classical information perfectly , that is @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it remains unknown whether the above super - additivity still holds if one of the quantum channels are with vanishing zero - error capacity .",
    "here we show that for quantum channels such type of stronger super - additivity can exist .",
    "actually , we show that there are quantum channels @xmath5 and @xmath6 such that @xmath15 , @xmath16 , but @xmath17 , where @xmath1 is dimension of the input state space of @xmath5 .",
    "the channel @xmath6 can be chosen as a noiseless qubit channel .",
    "if we are only concerned with zero - error classical capacity , then @xmath5 can be made entanglement - breaking ( theorem [ th2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , if a @xmath18 maximally entangled state is shared between the sender and the receiver or allowing two - way classical communication that is independent from the message sending from the main protocol , one use of @xmath5 can be used to send @xmath19 noiseless qubits .",
    "this type of @xmath5 has the following weird property : it is not able to communicate any classical information perfectly ; however , with a small amount of auxiliary resources ( such as one noiseless qubit channel , or one ebit , or two - way classical communication independent from the messages sending through main protocol ) , the channel acts as a noiseless quantum channel with large perfect quantum capacity ( achieving zero - error quantum capacity @xmath0 ) .",
    "intuitively , the hiding zero - error communication ability of channel can be activated by these auxiliary resources .",
    "our last main result is to study the role of classical feedback in zero - error communication .",
    "as pointed out by shannon , for classical channels , the classical feedback can not increase the ordinary channel capacity but may increase the zero - error capacity @xcite .",
    "however , a necessary condition for such a feedback improvement is that the channel should be able to communicate classical information perfectly , i.e. , with non - vanishing zero - error capacity .",
    "it is of great interest to ask that whether this requirement can be removed for quantum channels .",
    "surprisingly , this answer is yes .",
    "specifically , we construct a quantum channel with a two - dimensional input state space and vanishing zero - error classical capacity such that when assisted with classical feedback enables perfect transmission of classical and quantum information ( theorem [ cfb ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the zero - error capacity of quantum channels can be activated from @xmath20 to positive by classical feedback .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon , demonstrates that the zero - error communication ability of a quantum channel may be recovered when assisted with classical feedback .",
    "we notice that very recently several important super - activation effects about different type of capacities of quantum channels , namely quantum capacity , classical capacity , and the private capacity , were discovered @xcite",
    ". clearly , these results are incomparable to ours due to the special zero - error transmission requirement .",
    "let alice be the sender with state space @xmath21 , and let bob be the receiver with output state space @xmath22 .",
    "a _ quantum channel _",
    "@xmath5 is a completely positive map from @xmath23 to @xmath24 that can be written into the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the set of kraus operators and the completeness condition @xmath27 is satisfied .",
    "a _ super - operator _ is a completely positive map for which the completeness condition does nt need to be satisfied . for simplicity ,",
    "sometimes we identify a super - operator @xmath5 with kraus operators @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "a given quantum channel @xmath5 can be used for zero - error communication as follows : alice starts with @xmath30 , and encodes a message @xmath31 into a quantum state @xmath32 by a quantum operation @xmath33 , say @xmath34 .",
    "bob receives @xmath35 , and decodes the message @xmath31 by suitable quantum operations .",
    "define @xmath36 to be the maximum integer @xmath37 with which there exist a set of states @xmath38 such that @xmath39 can be perfectly distinguished by bob .",
    "it follows from the linearity of super - operators that a set @xmath40 achieving @xmath36 can be assumed without loss of generality to be orthogonal pure states . in @xcite @xmath36",
    "was termed as _ the quantum clique number _ of @xmath5 .",
    "intuitively , one use of @xmath5 can be used to transmit @xmath41 bits of classical information perfectly . when @xmath42 it is clear that by a single use of @xmath5 alice can not transmit any classical information to bob with zero probability of error .",
    "the _ zero - error classical capacity _ of @xmath5 , @xmath43 , is defined as follows : @xmath44    if we are concerned with the transmission of quantum information instead of classical information , the notion of zero - error quantum capacity can be similarly introduced .",
    "let @xmath45 be the maximum integer @xmath31 so that there is a @xmath31-dimensional subspace @xmath46 of @xmath21 can be perfectly transmitted through @xmath5 .",
    "that is , there is a recovery trace - preserving quantum channel @xmath47 from @xmath24 to @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for any @xmath50 .",
    "clearly , the quantity @xmath51 represents the optimal number of intact qubits one can send by a single use of @xmath5 .",
    "the _ zero - error quantum capacity _ of @xmath5 , @xmath52 , is defined as follows : @xmath53 in the following discussion , we mainly focus on the properties of @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "we will frequently employ the notion of unextendible bases ( ub ) .",
    "although this notion can be defined on arbitrary multipartite state space ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for our purpose here it suffices to focus on matrix spaces .",
    "let @xmath54 be a set of matrices on @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath54 is said to be a ub if @xmath56 contains no rank - one matrix ; otherwise @xmath54 is said to be extendible . clearly , when @xmath54 is a ub , any nonzero matrix in @xmath56 with rank at least two . in this case",
    "we say @xmath56 is completely entangled .",
    "if @xmath54 is a ub and can be spanned by rank - one matrix only , we say @xmath54 an unextendible product bases ( upb ) . the properties of ub , in particular upb , have been extensively studied in literature .",
    "we just mention two of them here .",
    "the first one is that the tensor product of two upb is again another upb @xcite .",
    "the second one is that if the dimension of a matrix subspace @xmath54 is small enough , say @xmath57 , @xmath54 is always extendible @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is classical ( a so - called memoryless stationary channel ) , that is , @xmath59 for some states @xmath60 diagonalized under the computational basis @xmath61 .",

    "[ th2 ] there is an entanglement - breaking channel @xmath245 on @xmath246 such that @xmath15 and @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is one qubit noiseless quantum channel .    proof .",
    "consider the quantum channel @xmath249 where @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 and @xmath254 are two orthonormal bases such that @xmath255 . by choice",
    "we have that @xmath256 if and only if @xmath257 or @xmath258 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath259 , and the set of input states can be chosen as @xmath260 .",
    "these facts will be useful later .",
    "first we show that @xmath15 .",
    "clearly @xmath5 is an entanglement breaking channel as it has a set of rank - one kraus operators .",
    "thus it suffices to show that @xmath42 .",
    "take an input state @xmath261 and calculate @xmath262 where for simplicity we assume @xmath263 and @xmath264 , etc .",
    "similarly , for another input state @xmath265 , we have @xmath266    if @xmath267 and @xmath268 are orthogonal , we should have @xmath269 from the first equation we know that @xmath270 or @xmath271 . without loss of generality , assume that @xmath270 .",
    "it follows from the second equation @xmath272 as @xmath273 .",
    "however this would imply that both @xmath274 and @xmath275 are nonzero , thus the third equation can not hold . with",
    "that we complete the proof of @xmath42 .",
    "the next step is to show that if a noiseless qubit channel @xmath248 is supplied between alice and bob , alice can send @xmath233 messages perfectly to bob using @xmath276 .",
    "let @xmath277 .",
    "the key here is that @xmath278 and @xmath279 are distinguishable by @xmath280 in the sense that @xmath281 and @xmath282 are orthogonal .",
    "if alice encodes message @xmath31 into @xmath283 and transmits it to bob via @xmath276 , the received states by bob are @xmath284 which are mutually orthogonal . that completes the proof of @xmath285 .",
    "@xmath81    it is easy to see that the role of the noiseless qubit channel @xmath248 can be replaced with a pre - shared @xmath18 maximally entangled state @xmath280 between alice and bob . to encode the message @xmath31",
    ", alice simply sends @xmath144 together with her half of entangled state to bob .",
    "the received states by bob are the same as above .",
    "with a more careful analysis we can easily see that @xmath286 and @xmath287 are locally distinguishable in the following way : bob performs a projective measurement according to @xmath288 , and then sends outcome @xmath7 to alice . if @xmath289 then alice measures her particle using the same basis , otherwise using diagonal basis @xmath290 .",
    "the outcomes @xmath291 correspond to @xmath286 , while @xmath292 correspond to @xmath287 .",
    "so a more economic way to achieve the perfect transmission is that : alice locally prepares a bell state @xmath280 and then send @xmath144 and one half of @xmath280 to bob .",
    "bob feedbacks his measurement outcome on the control qubit to alice .",
    "based on bob s information , alice performs the measurement on the left half of @xmath280 and forwards the measurement outcome to bob .",
    "bob will then know which of @xmath293 and @xmath294 is performed on the data input and can perfectly decode the message @xmath31 .",
    "note here we use two - way classical communication which is usually not allowable .",
    "however , from the above analysis we can see these communications are independent from the message @xmath31 we send in our main protocol . to summarize",
    ", we have the following    for the quantum channel @xmath5 constructed in above theorem , we have 1 ) @xmath295 , where the subscript means one ebit available ; 2 ) @xmath296 , where the subscript @xmath297 denotes the two - way classical communication independent of the message sending through the main protocol .    so far we havent touched the zero - error quantum capacity yet . using a similar construction",
    ", we can prove the strong super - additivity of @xmath3 .",
    "a somewhat surprising fact is that even for quantum channel with vanishing zero - error classical capacity , the super - activation effect remains possible .",
    "actually we have the following    [ th3 ] there is quantum channel @xmath245 with input state space @xmath246 such that @xmath15 and @xmath298 , where @xmath248 is the noiseless qubit channel .",
    "* outline of proof*. consider the following quantum channel : @xmath299 where @xmath300 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 is an orthogonal basis for @xmath303 , `` @xmath304 '' is the complex conjugate according to @xmath288 , and @xmath305 is a set of unitary operations on @xmath229 .",
    "the function of @xmath5 can be understood as follows : first , randomly choose an integer @xmath306 , and perform a projective measurement @xmath307 on the control input qubit .",
    "if the outcome is @xmath20 no action to the data input ; otherwise perform @xmath308 .",
    "second , output the classical information @xmath31 but keep the measurement outcome hidden .",
    "this is exactly one special instance of retro - correctible channel @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath71 is given by @xmath309 where @xmath310 and recall that @xmath311 .",
    "we can see that @xmath312 we will show that by choosing @xmath308 , @xmath313 , @xmath37 appropriately , the above inequality holds with equality . to achieve this , we only need to choose @xmath314 and @xmath308 so that @xmath315 spans @xmath316 , and @xmath317 spans @xmath318 . this can be done easily as @xmath319 and @xmath320    now it is clear that @xmath71 contains the following set of rank - one matrices : @xmath321 which is clearly a upb as its orthogonal complement is a completely entangled subspace @xmath322 .",
    "thus @xmath323 is unextendible for any @xmath324 , which follows @xmath15 .",
    "the argument that the above channel is able to communicate quantum information perfectly is similar to the analysis for the retro - correctible channels .",
    "the key idea is that with the assistance of shared entanglement , the hidden measurement outcome can be revealed .",
    "suppose that @xmath277 is supplied to alice and bob .",
    "then by inputting an arbitrary state @xmath325 into the data slot , and alice s half of the @xmath280 into control slot , bob receives the following output state @xmath326 note that @xmath327 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath328 .",
    "thus bob can perfectly distinguish them by a projective measurement .",
    "if the outcome is @xmath329 , then the data output is @xmath330 .",
    "if the outcome is @xmath331 , then the data output is @xmath332 . applying @xmath333 to the data output , we can recover @xmath330 .",
    "that means @xmath5 together with one ebit can be used to perfectly transfer a @xmath233-dimensional quantum system , or in other words , with entanglement - assisted zero - error quantum capacity at least @xmath0 qubits .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the role of shared entanglement can be replaced by a noiseless qubit channel .",
    "that immediately implies @xmath334 .",
    "notice further that @xmath335 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath328 that is locc distinguishable .",
    "so the assistance of two - way classical communications that are independent from the quantum information sending through the main protocol can be used to transmit @xmath0 noiseless qubits .",
    "the analysis is similar to the previous theorem and we omit the details here.@xmath81    there is quantum channel @xmath5 with input state space @xmath246 such that @xmath15 and 1 ) @xmath336 ; 2 ) @xmath337 ; 3 ) @xmath338 , where the subscript @xmath297 denotes two - way classical communications that are independent of the message sending through the main protocol ; 4 ) @xmath339 , where the subscript means one ebit available .",
    "the above corollary indicates the behaviors of zero - error capacity of quantum channels is very weird : there are quantum channels which have a large amount quantum capacity but with vanishing zero - error classical capacity .",
    "however , the channel can be unlocked for zero - error quantum communication if a small amount of additional resources such as two - way classical communication independent of the messages sending through the main protocol , shared entanglement , or a noiseless quantum channel is available .",
    "in this section we will study the role of classical feedback .",
    "a well known result in classical information theory is that a noiseless classical feedback channel from bob to alice can not increase the capacity of a classical channel . for quantum channels",
    ", it remains an open problem whether a classical feedback can strictly increase the capacity @xcite .",
    "however , in the special case that a quantum channel with zero classical capacity it should be a constant channel , i.e. , it sends any input quantum state to a fixed state . clearly , the classical feedback can not increase the capacity under this special assumption",
    "the situation is very different for quantum capacity , which can be increased by classical feedback even the unassisted quantum capacity is zero .",
    "a typical example is the quantum erasure channel with erasure probability more than @xmath340 , which has vanishing quantum capacity but nonzero classical feedback assisted quantum capacity @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that for certain classical noisy channels a noiseless classical feedback channel from bob to alice may strictly increase the zero - error classical capacity .",
    "all these channels should satisfy @xmath341 .",
    "in other words , without any assistance they can be used to communicate classical information perfectly .",
    "thus a question of interest is to ask whether this assumption can be removed .",
    "we provide an affirmative answer to this question as follows :    [ cfb ] there is quantum channel @xmath5 such that @xmath15 but @xmath342 and @xmath343 , where the subscript  cfb \" represents classical feedback from bob to alice .",
    "* the quantum channel constructed in eq . ( [ super ] ) is exactly one such channel when @xmath344 . to see this ,",
    "one only needs to show that one use of @xmath5 together with back communication can generate a shared entangled state @xmath345 .",
    "the protocol is as follows .",
    "first alice prepares @xmath346 and send half of them to bob .",
    "second bob measures the control output and feedbacks the outcome @xmath31 .",
    "for the moment he has already known the shared entangled state between him and alice should be one of @xmath345 or @xmath347 . after receiving @xmath31 ,",
    "alice performs a measurement according to @xmath348 .",
    "if @xmath329 is obtained , the final shared entangled state is @xmath345 ; if @xmath331 is obtained , the final shared entangled state is @xmath347 , and she only needs to perform @xmath349 to the left half of @xmath345 , thus the final resulting state is again @xmath345 . if @xmath344 , we already know that @xmath5 together with this entangled state can be used to send one noiseless qubit . in total ,",
    "two uses of @xmath5 and classical feedback enable one noiseless qubit transmission . therefore @xmath350    if in eq .",
    "( [ super ] ) we use a @xmath233-dimensional control input instead of a @xmath297-dimensional one , we will know that @xmath15 but @xmath351    there is , however , a quantum channel with only a two - dimensional input state space enjoying the same property .",
    "due to its simplicity , let us give a detailed analysis here . consider the following @xmath352 matrix subspace @xmath353 where @xmath354 are @xmath352 pauli matrices . by lemma [ keylemma ] , we know there is a quantum channel @xmath5 such that @xmath86 .",
    "we can construct one such channel by the arguments in the proof of lemma [ keylemma ] . here",
    "we will carefully construct one satisfying special requirement . first choose a positive definite bases for @xmath88 such that @xmath355 and @xmath356 where @xmath357 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath118 such that @xmath358 .",
    "take @xmath359 and construct the following quantum channel from @xmath360 to @xmath361 : @xmath362 where @xmath363 is an orthonormal basis for auxiliary system .",
    "noticing that @xmath364 is a upb , we have that @xmath365 for any @xmath324 .",
    "thus @xmath15 . on the other hand , @xmath366 .",
    "so if a maximally entangled state @xmath280 is shared between alice and bob , alice can send one bit to bob without any error . to do this",
    ", alice first encodes  0 \" by applying @xmath159 and  1 \" by applying @xmath367 to her half of the shared entangled state , respectively , and sends her half of @xmath280 to bob .",
    "the received states by bob are @xmath368 and @xmath369 respectively . by our assumption on @xmath370 , @xmath286 and @xmath287",
    "are orthogonal .",
    "thus bob can decode the bit perfectly .",
    "now the whole problem is reduced to generate a maximally entangled state between alice and bob using @xmath5 and classical feedback only . fortunately ,",
    "this can be done as follows :    step 1 .",
    "alice locally prepares @xmath280 and sends one half of @xmath280 to bob through @xmath5 .",
    "bob measures the auxiliary system according to @xmath363 .",
    "if the outcome is @xmath31 , bob will know that an entangled state @xmath371 with schmidt coefficient vector @xmath372 is generated between him and alice .",
    "repeat steps @xmath373 and @xmath297 once more , alice and bob will share a state @xmath374 , with schmidt coefficient vector @xmath375 .",
    "( however only bob knows the exact form of @xmath376 as alice does nt know the measurement outcomes @xmath31 and @xmath62 ) .",
    "bob feedbacks the measurement outcomes @xmath31 and @xmath62 to alice .",
    "so alice also knows the exact form of the shared entangled state between them .",
    "bob and alice transform the shared entangled state into a bell state with standard form @xmath280 . by nielsen",
    "s theorem @xcite , this can be achieved with certainty as @xmath377 .",
    "furthermore , the transformation can be done using local measurements and classical communications from bob to alice only .",
    "combining the above discussions , we know that @xmath378 uses together with back communication can transmit one bit perfectly from alice to bob .",
    "thus @xmath379 .",
    "moreover , we can send a qubit by sending two bits and consuming one ebit .",
    "easily see that @xmath380 uses of @xmath5 can transmit one noiseless qubit .",
    "hence @xmath381.@xmath81    it seems that the retro - correctible channel @xmath382 introduced in @xcite might enjoy the same property as above .",
    "however , we do nt know how to determine the value of @xmath383 and consequently , it remains unknown whether @xmath383 is vanishing or not .",
    "in sum , we have demonstrated that for a class of quantum channels , a single use of the channel can not be used to transmit classical information with zero probability of error , while multiple uses can .",
    "this super - activation property is enabled by quantum entanglement between different uses , thus can not be achieved by classical channels .",
    "we also have shown that additional resources such as classical communications independent of sending messages , shared entanglement , and noiseless quantum communication would be greatly improve the zero - error capacity for certain channels .",
    "in particular , both the zero - error classical capacity and zero - error quantum capacity are strongly super - additive even one of the channels is with vanishing zero - error classical capacity .",
    "finally we construct a special class of quantum channels to show that the classical feedback enables perfect transmission of both classical and quantum information even when the quantum channel has vanishing zero - error classical capacity .",
    "these results suggest that a new quantum zero - error information theory would be highly desirable .",
    "many interesting problems remain open , and here we mention two of them . the first one is to show whether the following strongest super - additivity is possible : find quantum channels @xmath5 and @xmath6 such that @xmath384 and @xmath385 . according to lemma [ keylemma ] , this is equivalent to find two matrix subspaces @xmath148 and @xmath149 such that 1 ) @xmath386 and @xmath387 ; 2 ) @xmath388 are unextendible for any @xmath324 , @xmath389 ; and 3 ) @xmath150 are unextendible .",
    "the quantum channels presented in lemma [ main - lemma ] may be eligible candidates .",
    "however , we are not able to answer this question at present as we do nt have a feasible way to check whether @xmath388 is extendible for @xmath390 .",
    "the second one is to study corresponding problems about the zero - error quantum capacity @xmath3 . in this case",
    "we do nt even know whether @xmath391 is super - multiplicative . a result similar to lemma [ main - lemma ] would be highly desirable .",
    "all these problems can be successfully solved for another notion of unambiguous capacity , which is a generalization of zero - error capacity by requiring the decoding process to be unambiguous @xcite .",
    "* note added : * after the completion of this work , the author happened to know that cubitt , chen , and harrow also independently obtained some super - activation results about the zero - error classical capacity which partially overlap with ours @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they employed the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism between quantum channels and a class of bipartite mixed states to establish a theorem similar to lemma [ keylemma ] here .",
    "then two quantum channels @xmath5 and @xmath6 with four - dimensional input state spaces such that @xmath146 and @xmath392 were explicitly constructed .",
    "they further applied some powerful techniques from algebraic geometry to show that a pair of quantum channels satisfying the strongest super - additivity does exist , and thus solved the open problem mentioned above .",
    "( one of these techniques is a result about strongly unextendible bases that was previously proven and used in @xcite to demonstrate a similar super - activation effect for unambiguous capacity of quantum channels ) clearly , their remarkable result established the strongest type of super - additivity , which they termed as the super - activation of the asymptotic zero - error classical capacity of quantum channels .",
    "interestingly , it is not difficult to show that all channels we constructed in theorems [ th2]-[cfb ] can not be activated by any quantum channel @xmath6 with @xmath393 .",
    "thus it is still a surprising fact that these channels do satisfy certain type of super - activation effects which are definitely impossible for any classical channel .",
