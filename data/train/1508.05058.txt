    "let @xmath0 be a manifold and @xmath1 a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by a vector field @xmath2 on @xmath0 . on the general linear frame bundle @xmath3 we define a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",
    "this one - parameter group is generated by a vector field @xmath6 on @xmath7 , which we call the frame bundle lift of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a lie group with closed subgroup @xmath9 , @xmath10 a principal @xmath11-bundle with @xmath12 and @xmath13 a cartan connection which is first order reductive , i.e. , the adjoint representation of @xmath11 on the lie algebra @xmath14 splits into subrepresentations @xmath15 and the resulting representation on @xmath16 is faithful , and such that the @xmath16-valued part @xmath17 of @xmath18 is the solder form on @xmath19 .",
    "we call the cartan geometry @xmath20 _ _ invariant__@xcite under a vector field @xmath2 on @xmath0 if and only if the frame bundle lift @xmath6 is tangent to @xmath19 and its restriction to @xmath19 preserves @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "we apply the notion of invariance defined above to a number of common spacetime geometries used in various models of gravity .",
    "these geometries can be written as first - order reductive cartan geometries .",
    "in particular , we obtain the following notions of invariance under a vector field @xmath2 :    affine geometry with connection @xmath22 : @xmath23    riemann - cartan geometry with metric @xmath24 and torsion @xmath25 : @xmath26    riemannian geometry with metric @xmath24 : @xmath27    weizenbck geometry with tetrad @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant infinitesimal lorentz transformation .",
    "finsler geometry@xcite with finsler length function @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the tangent bundle lift of @xmath2 , i.e. , the vector field on @xmath34 which is defined in analogy to the frame bundle lift @xmath6 , but replacing the diffeomorphisms @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "these notions of invariance agree with the standard notions of invariance on the respective spacetime models .",
