    "the goal of the athena ( apparatus for high precision experiments on neutral antimatter ) @xcite experiment at cern , is to produce and store low energy anti - hydrogen atoms ( @xmath5s ) .",
    "the 1s-2s transition can be excited resonantly and compared with that of the hydrogen atom ( @xmath6 ) to a high precision @xcite .",
    "any difference may be due either to cpt violation or to an anomalous red shift originated by a different gravitational interaction of antimatter @xcite .",
    "+ a bunched beam of @xmath7s with a length of @xmath2 250 ns ( fwhm ) and a momentum of 100 mev / c delivered by the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) @xcite is degraded before entering a multi - ring penning trap .",
    "only @xmath8 of the beam is trapped , cooled to sub - ev level by electron cooling @xcite and accumulated . at the same time",
    "@xmath9 low energy positrons ( @xmath10s ) , emitted by a @xmath11 source , are slowed down , trapped and accumulated in another trap .",
    "+ one of the major challenges will consist in bringing @xmath1s and @xmath10s in close contact to allow their recombination in a nested penning trap @xcite .",
    "once @xmath1s and @xmath10s are recombined , the confinement by electric forces ceases and the @xmath5 would escape , hit the nearest wall and annihilate . + to confine the produced @xmath5 , the use of magnetic gradients interacting with the @xmath5 s magnetic moment is investigated for the second phase .",
    "the athena beam line is sketched in fig . [ fig : beam_line ] :    the injected @xmath1s travel inside a solenoidal magnetic field of 3 t and are degraded by @xmath12 of stainless steel put 10 cm in front of the @xmath1 catching trap and by @xmath13 of al put on the first electrode of the same trap .",
    "the degraders further slow down the beam in order to have a better trapping efficiency ; the possibility to use only one gas degrader to have more flexibility is under study . +",
    "a @xmath14 thick si diode segmented in @xmath15 pads , located 15.5 cm before the @xmath1 trap , measures the beam position just before the entrance window of the trap .",
    "the beam transmission of the si diode is @xmath16 .",
    "+ on the basis of a monte carlo simulation , a trapping efficiency of @xmath8 is expected with @xmath17 of the beam that annihilates on the degraders and the remaining @xmath17 with energy higher than @xmath18 kev , corresponding to the highest trapping potential , that escapes from the trap and travels until the end of the cryostat where it annihilates . +",
    "a beam detector is necessary to monitor the beam intensity and the beam stability , to detect possible losses of @xmath1 along the beam pipe and to measure the @xmath1 trapping efficiency .",
    "such a device is supposed to detect the pions coming from the annihilation of the @xmath1s in the degraders , on the end of the cryostat and , eventually , in the beam pipe .",
    "being the rate of the pions very high ( @xmath19 hz ) , the beam detector ca nt operate in pulse mode counting the single particles : hence the current mode operation , measuring the total charge generated by the pions in the active volume during every shot , is necessary . to fulfil all these tasks ,",
    "the beam detector must be stable and linear to high intensities and over a wide dynamic range ; furthermore a good flexibility is required until the beam features are completely understood .",
    "the beam detector consists of 3 systems each of 2 modules of plastic scintillator bicron bc408 ( with peak emission wavelength of 425 nm ) .",
    "the 3 systems , referred to as front , barrel and endcap , are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam_line ] while their dimensions are reported in table [ tab : scint_dim ] .",
    ".dimensions of the 3 scintillator systems . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results are compatible within the errors and show that an absolute calibration is possible at the level of 7.3@xmath20 for the am and of 3.8@xmath20 for the sm .",
    "the calibration performed with the sm is twice more accurate , being the sensitivity of the sp very high ( @xmath21 ) at these intensity . on the other hand",
    "the number of @xmath1s is measured inside the ring before the electron cooling process at 100 mev / c and before the extraction and so possible cooling inefficiencies and losses in the ejection line are not taken into account .",
    "for these reasons the am is more reliable than the sm , at least in this experimental situation , because the number of @xmath1s is measured at the end of the ejection line , even if with a worse error . a better calibration with the sm will be possible next year when the ejection line will be equipped of a low noise sp to measure directly the beam intensity after the extraction .",
    "a second test with the beam completely dumped was performed to measure the hpd response to a large amount of light and to perform an absolute calibration with the sm .",
    "the used experimental set up is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullstop_setup ] :    the front scintillators , coupled to hpd5 and hpd6 , and the barrel ones , coupled to hpd7 and hpd8 were used .",
    "the solid angles covered by a front scintillator is @xmath22 , that by a barrel one is @xmath23 .",
    "the pc high voltage was set at -4 kv and the bias at -80 v ; the signals from the hpds were attenuated by a total of 61 db for hpd5 and hpd6 , and by 35 db for hpd7 and hpd8 .",
    "[ fig : fullstop_sigls ] are reported the signals directly extracted    from the diode s output and sent to the scope : they are correlated in time and follow the longitudinal beam structure .",
    "the long tail on the trailing edge of the signals from hpd5 and hpd6 maybe due to the screening of the bias field by the large charge generated in the si chip ( plasma effect ) .",
    "the tail effect is of @xmath24 and all the charge is completely collected in @xmath25 .",
    "this tail can be eliminated using a higher bias voltage .",
    "no trace of saturation is evident from hpd7 and hpd8 : in this case the charge generated is much smaller . + a detailed study of the waveforms could be useful in the future to monitor the beam quality in parasitic mode .",
    "[ fig : fullstop_adc56 ] the histograms of the adc counts ( divided by the attenuation factors ) of hpd5 ( left , solid line ) , of hpd6 ( left , dashed line ) and their correlation plot are reported .",
    "the mean number of adc counts ( corrected for the attenuation factors ) is @xmath26 adc counts for hpd5 and @xmath27 adc counts for hpd6 .",
    "+ a calibration with the sm of the front system gave the following results : @xmath28 adc counts/@xmath1 for hpd5 and @xmath29 adc counts/@xmath1 for hpd6 ( the number of adc counts is normalised to the solid angle ) .",
    "a cross check with the previous calibration , by rescaling the solid angles and the hpd gain , is consistent within @xmath30 .",
    "in the 2001 run all the 6 scintillators shown in fig . [",
    "fig : beam_line ] will be used : the front ones to detect possible beam losses , especially during the steering of the extraction line , the barrel ones to monitor the beam intensity parasitically and the endcap ones to measure the trapping efficiency when the variable degrader will be ready .",
    "+ once the ejection line will be equipped with the new sp , a more precise calibration will be done with the sm . + a detailed study of the hpd s waveforms will be useful in further understanding the characteristics of the beam and to improve its quality , a crucial item for the athena physics .",
    "the beam detector of the athena experiment has been described : it consists of 6 plastic scintillators , each coupled from one side to a proximity focused hpd without preamplifier .",
    "this system , after a calibration , has been used to monitor parasitically a bunched beam of @xmath31s with a width of @xmath2 250 ns ( fwhm ) , to detect possible losses in the beam pipe and to measure the @xmath1 trapping efficiency .",
    "this detector is linear and stable up to charge responses of @xmath32 nc and it works with no loss of efficiency in the stray field of the athena solenoid .",
    "it is a reliable device , giving the opportunity to vary its gain from zero to a few thousands without any change neither in detection efficiency , nor in linearity .",
    "+ it is the first time that a hpd is used without preamplifier , taking advantage of the huge amount of light , to exploit its huge dynamic range .",
