    "the light pseudoscalar particle named _ axion _ is an important element of the standard model and its generalizations .",
    "axion arises @xcite due to breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry which was introduced @xcite in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in order to avoid strong _ cp _ violation and large electric dipole moment of a neutron ( numerous experiments exclude both these effects to a high level of precision ) . what is more , axions provide an elegant solution for the problem of dark matter in astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why a lot of experiments for searching axions has been performed in different countries @xcite .",
    "specifically , strong constraints on the coupling constants of an axion and other axion - like particles with photons , electrons and nucleons were obtained from astrophysical observations .",
    "up to the present , however , there is the so - called _ window _ in the values of an axion mass , where these constraints are either missing or not sufficiently strong .",
    "there are also massless and light scalar particles predicted in many extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "exchange of such particles between atoms of two macrobodies leads to corrections to the newton law of gravitation at separations below a micrometer . by coincidence , at so small separations newton s gravitational law is not verified experimentally with sufficient precision . within a submicrometer interaction range experiment does not exclude corrections which exceed the newton gravitational force by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "similar corrections are predicted in extra - dimensional models with a low - energy compactification scale @xcite .",
    "many experiments of etvos- and cavendish - type have been performed during the last few years searching for possible corrections to the newton law of gravitation @xcite .",
    "recently it was found @xcite that strong model - independent constraints on the coupling constants of axions with nucleons follow from measurements of the casimir - polder and casimir force .",
    "some of these constraints overlap with an axion window and , thus , are complementary to astrophysical limits . as to corrections to newton s law of gravitation ,",
    "measurements of the van der waals and casimir forces have long been used to constrain their parameters @xcite .",
    "new , more precise measurements of the casimir force allowed significant strengthening of previously obtained constraints on non - newtonian gravity over the region of separations below @xmath1 m @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we review constraints on the coupling constants of an axion to a proton and a neutron , and corrections to newton s law of gravitation which follow from the most precise measurements of the casimir interaction @xcite . we compare the obtained constraints on an axion with the alternative constraints following from some other laboratory experiments .",
    "the constraints on the coupling constants of an axion and on non - newtonian gravity , following from measurements of the casimir interaction , are mutually compared and some conclusions inherent to both of them are obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the types of effective potentials which arise due to one- and two - axion exchange .",
    "these are compared with the effective potentials originating from the exchange of massless and massive scalar particles .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the constraints on axion - nucleon coupling constants which follow from measurements of the casimir - polder force acting between the condensate of @xmath2rb atoms and a glass silica plate . in section 4",
    "the constraints on axion to nucleon coupling constants are presented obtained from measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between a microsphere and a plate coated with a nonmagnetic metal au or a magnetic metal ni .",
    "these experiments were performed by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "section 5 contains similar constraints obtained from measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between au - coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate using a micromachined oscillator . in section 6",
    "the constraints on the coupling constants of an axion are provided which follow from measurements of the casimir force between corrugated surfaces . in section 7",
    "we compare the constraints on an axion found from measurements of the casimir interaction with those obtained from some other laboratory experiments .",
    "section 8 is devoted to the constraints on non - newtonian gravity derived from the casimir effect . in section 9",
    "the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .    throughout the paper we use units in which @xmath3 .",
    "below we consider effective potentials arising from the interaction of nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) with an axion and other axion - like particles predicted in different variants of the grand unification theories .",
    "axions also interact with electrons and photons .",
    "these interactions are , however , much weaker than axion - nucleon interaction @xcite and for our purposes can be neglected . in any case",
    ", their account would lead to only a minor strengthening of the constraints on axion - nucleon coupling constants obtained from the force measurements between macroscopic bodies .",
    "we assume that the interaction of axion - like particles @xmath4 with nucleons @xmath5 is described by the lagrangian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the coupling constant of an axion to a proton ( @xmath8 ) or to a neutron ( @xmath9 ) . in doing",
    "so the pseudoscalar coupling of axions and other axion - like particles to nucleons is assumed ( note that the pseudovector coupling introduced for the original qcd axions results in the nonrenormalizable theory @xcite ) . the exchange of one axion between two nucleons of spins @xmath10 situated at the points @xmath11 with coupling ( [ eq1 ] ) results in the following effective potential @xcite @xmath12\\,e^{-m_a|\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}_1-\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}_2|}. \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 and @xmath13 are the axion - proton ( @xmath14 ) or axion - neutron ( @xmath15 ) interaction constants , @xmath16 are the nucleon masses , @xmath17 is the axion mass , and the unit vector @xmath18 .",
    "as is seen in ( [ eq2 ] ) , the effective potential depends on the nucleon spins . because of this , the resulting interaction between two unpolarized test bodies averages to zero .",
    "taking into account that already performed experiments on measuring the casimir interaction @xcite deal with unpolarized test bodies , it seems impossible to use them for constraining the axion to nucleon coupling constants basing on the simplest process of one - axion exchange .",
    "the situation changes when we consider the process of two - axion exchange between the two nucleons . in this case",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) leads to the following effective potential @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "note that ( [ eq3 ] ) is derived under the condition @xmath21 which is satisfied with a large safety margin in all the experiments considered below .",
    "equation ( [ eq3 ] ) does not depend on the nucleon spins .",
    "thus , after the integration over the volumes of test bodies , it leads to some additional force of the axionic origin which can be constrained from the measurement results .",
    "now we address to exchange of massless and light scalar particles between the atoms of two macroscopic bodies .",
    "the exchange of one light scalar particle of mass @xmath22 between two pointlike particles with masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 spaced at the points @xmath25 and @xmath26 results in the spin - independent yukawa - type effective potential @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize this potential as a correction to newton s law of gravitation : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is a dimensionless constant characterizing the strength of yukawa interaction , @xmath29 is the compton wavelength of light scalar particle characterizing the interaction range , and @xmath30 is the newtonian gravitational constant . as was noted in section 1 , the effective potential ( [ eq4 ] ) arises also in extradimensional models with a low - energy compactification scale @xcite . in this case",
    "the quantity @xmath31 has the meaning of the characteristic size of a multidimensional compact manifold .",
    "the exchange of one massless scalar particle leads to an effective potential which is inversely proportional to the separation distance . the exchange of an even number of massless pseudoscalar particles ( for instance , by the arions ) results in the effective potentials inversely proportional to higher powers of the separation .",
    "similar potentials arise also due to the exchange of two neutrinos , two goldstinos , or other massless fermions @xcite .",
    "the power - type effective potentials are also usually parametrized as corrections to newton s law of gravitation @xmath32 . \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath34 is a positive integer , and @xmath35 m is chosen to preserve the correct dimension of energy at different @xmath34 . note that the exchange by two axion - like particles in the limiting case @xmath36 in accordance to ( [ eq3 ] ) results in the potential @xcite @xmath37 this can be represented as a correction to newton s law of gravitation in ( [ eq5 ] ) with @xmath38 ( the same power - type interaction is obtained from the exchange of two arions ) .",
    "the effective potential ( [ eq5 ] ) with @xmath38 is also obtained from extra - dimensional models with noncompact ( but warped ) extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the casimir - polder force acting between @xmath2rb atoms belonging to a bose - einstein condensate cloud and a sio@xmath39 plate was measured by means of the following dynamic experiment @xcite .",
    "the condensate cloud was placed in a magnetic trap with frequencies @xmath40rad / s in the perpendicular direction to the plate and @xmath41rad / s in the lateral direction .",
    "the thomas - fermi radii of the condensate cloud of @xmath2rb atoms in the perpendicular and lateral directions were @xmath42 m and @xmath43 m , respectively .",
    "the dipole oscillations of the condensate in the @xmath44 direction with a constant amplitude @xmath45 m were excited . the separation distance @xmath4 between the center of mass of a condensate and a plate",
    "was varied from 6.88 to @xmath46 m , i.e. , in the region where the thermal effects in the casimir - polder force contribute essentially .",
    "the temperature of the plate was equal to either @xmath47k ( as in an environment ) or @xmath48k and @xmath49k ( which corresponds to out of equilibrium situations ) .",
    "however , for constraining the parameters of an axion , the strongest result follows from the measurements in thermal equilibrium .    under the influence of the casimir - polder force between @xmath2rb atoms and a plate ,",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath50 slightly shifts to some other value @xmath51 .",
    "the relative frequency shift is given by @xmath52 this frequency shift was measured @xcite as a function of @xmath4 with some measurement errors determined at a 67% confidence level .",
    "for example , at the shortest separation @xmath53 m this absolute error was @xmath54 .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 was also calculated using the lifshitz theory of atom - wall interaction and subsequent averaging over the condensate cloud . under the assumption that sio@xmath39 is an ideal insulator , i.e. , by disregarding the influence of its dc conductivity , it was found @xcite that the measurement results are in agreement with theory in the limits of the experimental error @xmath56 (",
    "the importance of this assumption was demonstrated later @xcite ) .    due to the interaction potential ( [ eq3 ] )",
    ", there may be also some additional force between a condensate cloud and a plate caused by the two - axion exchange between protons and neutrons belonging to them .",
    "the respective additional frequency shift can be calculated by the additive summation of ( [ eq3 ] ) over all nucleons of a @xmath2rb atom and a plate with subsequent averaging over the condensate cloud ( see @xcite for details ) . under an assumption that the plate has an infinitely large area ( it was shown @xcite that relative corrections to the result due to a finite plate area are of order @xmath57 ) the additional frequency shift due to two - axion exchange",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass of @xmath2rb atom and the function @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 here , @xmath62 mm is the thickness of sio@xmath39 plate and @xmath63 the constant @xmath64 in ( [ eq8 ] ) depends on the material properties as follows @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the plate density , @xmath67 is the mean nucleon mass , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of protons and the mean number of neutrons in a sio@xmath39 molecule , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mean mass of a sio@xmath39 molecule and @xmath72 is the mass of atomic hydrogen .",
    "taking into account that the observed frequency shift was in agreement with that originating from the casimir - polder force , the additional frequency shift ( [ eq8 ] ) due to two - axion exchange should be constrained by the magnitude of the experimental error @xmath73 from the numerical analysis of this equation , the constraints on axion - nucleon coupling constants were obtained @xcite under different assumptions about a relationship between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for example , under a natural assumption that @xmath76 @xcite , the resulting constraints are shown in fig .  1 , where the region of the plane above the line is excluded and the region below the line is allowed .",
    "these constraints cover the wide region of axion masses from @xmath77 to 0.3ev . as is seen in fig .  1",
    ", the strength of constraints decreases with increasing axion mass . in section 7",
    "we compare the constraints of fig .  1 with those obtained from other measurements of the casimir force and different laboratory experiments .",
    "in the sequence of three experiments , the gradient of the casimir force was measured between the surfaces of a hollow sphere and a plate both coated with au films @xcite , with au and ni films , respectively @xcite , and with ni films @xcite . for technological purposes ,",
    "there were also various material layers below au and ni coatings on both a hollow sphere made of fused silica ( sio@xmath39 ) and a sapphire ( al@xmath39o@xmath78 ) plate .",
    "the radii of spheres were of about @xmath79 m and the plates ( disks ) were of approximately 5 mm radius , i.e. , by a factor of 100 larger than the spheres .",
    "measurements of the gradient of the casimir force , @xmath80 , as a function of separation @xmath4 between the plate and the sphere , were performed by means of dynamic afm ( see @xcite for details ) . in all three experiments",
    "the measurement results were found in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory in the limits of the experimental errors @xmath81 .",
    "calculations of the theoretical force gradients were performed with omitted relaxation properties of conduction electrons in metals ( an account of the relaxation properties of conduction electrons in computations using the lifshitz theory leads to disagreement with the measurement data of many experiments @xcite ) .",
    "the two - axion exchange between nucleons belonging to a sphere and a plate leads to some attraction in addition to the casimir force .",
    "the gradient of this additional force acting between a spherical envelope ( layer ) of thickness @xmath82 and external radius @xmath83 , and a plate of thickness @xmath84 can be calculated by the additive summation of the interaction potentials ( [ eq3 ] ) @xcite @xmath85 , \\label{eq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath86 is defined as @xmath87 the coefficients @xmath88 for a plate ( spherical layer ) materials are given by @xmath89 @xmath90 are the plate ( spherical layer ) densities , and the quantities @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 have the same meaning , as explained below ( [ eq11 ] ) , but in application to the molecules ( atoms ) of a plate and a spherical layer , respectively .",
    "taking into account that no additional force was observed in the experiment @xcite within the measurement error , one can write @xmath108 numerical analysis of this equation leads to new constraints on the interaction constants @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",
    "the strongest constraints are obtained at the shortest experimental separation @xmath109 nm . at this separation distance",
    "the experimental error determined at a 67% confidence level is @xmath110n / m @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 we show these constraints by the solid line under the assumption @xmath111 ( see @xcite for the alternative assumptions ) .",
    "the region of the plane above the line is excluded , and the region below the line is allowed .",
    "the comparison of the solid line in fig .  2 with the line in fig .",
    "1 shows that the constraints following from measurements of the gradient of the casimir force are stronger than those obtained from measurements of the casimir - polder force .",
    "the largest strengthening by a factor of 170 is achieved for the axion mass @xmath112ev .",
    "similar results can be obtained @xcite from the measurement data of experiment with a au - coated spherical envelope of @xmath113 m radius and a ni - coated plate @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the additional force due to two - axion exchange is again given by ( [ eq16 ] ) , where @xmath114 is presented in ( [ eq17 ] ) and @xmath115 takes a more simple form due to the absence of an al layer below a ni coating @xmath116 here , @xmath117 nm and @xmath118 can be calculated using ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "the constraints on the coupling constants of axions to nucleons can be again obtained from ( [ eq18 ] ) .",

    "the constraints obtained under the condition @xmath111 are shown by the long - dashed line in fig .",
    "2 . as can be seen in fig .  2 ,",
    "the constraints following from the experiment with au - ni test bodies are up to a factor 1.5 weaker than those obtained from the experiment with au - au test bodies .",
    "the main reason is the smaller density of ni , as compared with au .    in the third experiment , a ni - coated spherical envelope of @xmath121 m radius and a ni - coated plate",
    "were used @xcite .",
    "the additional force can be again expressed by ( [ eq16 ] ) . in this case , however , the functions @xmath115 and @xmath114 are more complicated than in the previously considered experiments because for technological purposes there were two additional layers ( al and cr ) below the ni coating on both a spherical envelope and on a plate ( see @xcite for explicit expressions ) .",
    "the constraints on @xmath111 were again obtained from ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "the strongest constraints follow at the shortest separation distance ( @xmath122 nm in this case ) .",
    "the total experimental error determined at a 67% confidence level at the shortest separation is @xmath123n / m @xcite .",
    "the obtained constraints are shown by the short - dashed line in fig .",
    "2 . they are slightly weaker than those following from the experiments with au - au and au - ni test bodies .",
    "this is again explained by the smaller density of ni in comparison with that of au ( see section 7 for comparison with other laboratory constraints ) .",

    ", we recalculate this error to a 67% confidence level in order to obtain constraints comparable with those following from other experiments .",
    "the theoretical results were obtained with omitted contribution of the relaxation properties of free electrons ( taking these properties into account leads to theoretical predictions excluded by the measurement data @xcite ) .",
    "the constraints on the axion - nucleon interaction constants were found from the inequality @xmath135 for different regions of axion masses the strongest constraints follow from ( [ eq22 ] ) at different separation distances .",
    "thus , within the regions @xmath136ev , @xmath137ev and @xmath138ev the strongest constraints were obtained at @xmath139 , 200 and 162 nm , respectively . at these separations",
    "the total experimental errors in measurements of the casimir pressure recalculated to a 67% confidence level were equal to 0.22 , 0.38 , and 0.55mpa , respectively . in fig .",

    "several measurements of the casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate were performed in the case when the surface of at least one test body is not smooth , but covered with the longitudinal corrugations @xcite .",
    "the shape of the corrugations was either sinusoidal @xcite or rectangular @xcite ( in the latter case the sphere was smooth , and only the plate was corrugated ) .",

    "6 we present the strongest constraints on the yukawa interaction constant @xmath28 in the micrometer and submicrometer interaction range @xmath31 obtained from measurements of the casimir interaction .",
    "the line 1 in fig .",
    "6 was obtained @xcite from measurements of the lateral casimir force between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate @xcite ( see section 6 ) .",
    "it presents the strongest constraints on the yukawa - type corrections to newton s law of gravitation within the interaction range from @xmath182 to 11.6 nm . the line 2 shows constraints found @xcite from measuring the normal casimir force between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces at the angle between corrugations equal to 2.4@xmath157 @xcite ( see section 6 ) .",
    "these constraints are the strongest ones in the interaction range from 11.6 to 17.2 nm .",
    "the constraints obtained from measurements of the casimir pressure by means of a micromachined torsional oscillator ( see section 5 ) are indicated by the line 3 .",
    "they are the strongest ones for @xmath183 nm . at larger @xmath31 the most strong constraints shown by the line 4",
    "follow from the so - called casimir - less experiment @xcite , where the casimir force was nullified by using the difference force measurement scheme .",
    "these constraints are the strongest ones up to @xmath184 nm . the constraints of the line 5 are found @xcite from measurements of the casimir force between au - coated surfaces of a plate and a spherical lens of large radius .",
    "they are the strongest ones up to @xmath185 m . for larger @xmath31 the strongest constraints on the yukawa - type corrections",
    "to newton s gravitational law follow from the cavendish - type experiments .",
    "the first constraints of such kind are indicated by the line 6 @xcite .",
    "thus , measurements of the casimir interaction lead to the most strong constraints on non - newtonian gravity over a wide interaction range from 1.6 nm to a few micrometers . as can be seen in fig .  6",
    ", the strength of all constraints decreases with decreasing @xmath31 , i.e. , with increasing mass of a hypothetical particle which initiates the additional interaction of yukawa - type .",
    "this is similar to the case of an axion considered in sections 36 .",
    "constraints on the power - type corrections to newton s law of gravitation ( [ eq5 ] ) follow from the gravitational experiments of etvos and cavendish type @xcite and from measurements of the casimir force @xcite . at the present time",
    "the most strong constraints follow from the etvos - type experiments ( @xmath186 @xcite and @xmath187 @xcite ) and from the cavendish - type experiments ( @xmath188 @xcite , @xmath189 @xcite , and @xmath190 @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xcite uses another parametrization for the power - type corrections to newtonian gravitation .",
    "in the foregoing , we have considered the constraints on axion to nucleon couplings following from laboratory experiments on measuring the casimir interaction .",
    "the obtained constraints are quite competitive in the region of axion masses from @xmath175 to 20ev .",
    "the most strong of them follow from a dynamic determination of the casimir pressure between two parallel plates and from measurement of the lateral casimir force between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces .",
    "all these constraints were derived by considering the process of two - axion exchange between two nucleons .",
    "this process is of the lowest order contributing to the force acting between unpolarized test bodies .",
    "the obtained constraints were compared with those following from other laboratory experiments .",
    "we have also compared the constraints on an axion with previously obtained constraints on corrections to the newton law of gravitation of yukawa and power type",
    ". the most strong constraints of this kind following from measurements of the casimir interaction are collected . in the interaction range below a few micrometers they are stronger than the constraints on yukawa - type corrections to newton s law following from the gravitational experiments of etvos and cavendish type .    in future",
    "it would be interesting to perform measurements of the casimir interaction between two polarized test bodies .",
    "this would lead to an additional force due to exchange of one axion between protons and neutrons and , as a consequence , to much stronger constraints on the axion to nucleon coupling constants .",
