    "the study of nuclei far from the @xmath2-stability line has drawn the attention of nuclear physicists .",
    "the implications of the structure and reaction cross - sections from these nuclei play an important role in the description of nucleosynthesis processes such as the r - process , which takes place in the region of neutron rich nuclei .",
    "in addition to this , these nuclei are the perfect place to test the validity of some successful methods and theories , which have rendered satisfactory results along the stability line for medium - heavy nuclei .",
    "the development of new experimental facilities and the implementation of new techniques have already given experimental data for some of these , like the doubly - magic nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "some of the new approaches being tested are those of relativistic mean - field models . in this paper",
    "we are going to deal with a relativistic mean - field theory derived from the chiral effective lagrangian of furnstahl , serot and tang  @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian , which incorporates the symmetries of qcd , particularly a non - linear realization of chiral symmetry , is built as an effective field theory and contains the lowest lying hadronic degrees of freedom as the main ingredients . though it reproduces the ground - state properties of stable doubly - magic nuclei ,",
    "its predictability far from the @xmath2-stability region has not been tested , especially the convergence of the calculations as the number of effective terms in the lagrangian increases .",
    "relativistic mean - field models can account for a large number of bulk properties of nuclei and there are different methods that have produced acceptable results .",
    "recently , toki , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a relativistic mean - field approach to calculate properties of nuclei from the proton to the neutron drip lines , extending the calculations to super - heavy nuclei .",
    "the good agreement with known experimental data shows how relativistic mean - field models can account for a variety of phenomena in the nuclear many - body system .",
    "toki and his co - workers , using a _ mean effective lagrangian _ , have an extensive program underway on applications of this approach to astrophysics , in particular to element formation in supernovas  @xcite .",
    "the idea of using effective field theories to describe the nuclear problem is an increasing field of study , an account of recent results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean - field approach to the nuclear many - body problem has been successful in describing medium - size nuclei , and its success can be understood under the perspective of effective field theory ( eft ) and density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "the success of previous relativistic mean - field models , like the original walecka model  @xcite and its extensions to include nonlinear couplings of the @xmath5 field , is now understood by applying the ideas of naturalness from eft  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of various mean - field models and an account of their success was presented by furnstahl , et al  @xcite . in that paper",
    "it was shown , using the eft approach and nda , why various mean - field approaches have been successful and that the use of different degrees of freedom to describe nuclear properties corresponds to different organizational principles .",
    "thus a description of the nuclear many - body system based on nucleon and meson fields , as in this approach , or an expansion in nucleon densities , as in the skyrme model , are equivalent .",
    "the principles of eft rely on the fact that there exist natural scales and in order to understand a particular phenomenon it is enough to use probes that can resolve the dynamics at that scale .",
    "these probes are the relevant degrees of freedom needed to describe the system .",
    "the most general lagrangian density is built from these interacting fields paying attention to symmetries imposed by an underlying theory ( qcd in this case ) and arranged by some organizing principle , like the naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) from georgi and manohar  @xcite .",
    "the unknown dynamics , of heavier degrees of freedom , is integrated out and appears as coupling constants in the theory .",
    "these are determined by fitting the theory to known experimental data .",
    "the number of terms in this eft lagrangian is infinite and , in order to give predictive power to the model , it is necessary to have an organizing principle that groups together terms that contribute at the same level . in this way it is possible to truncate the expansion at some arbitrary order and be certain that all non - redundant terms , of the same order , have already been taken into account .",
    "the inclusion of new interaction terms in the lagrangian aims to give a better description of the energy functional , thus going beyond the hartree approximation and incorporating exchange - correlation effects .",
    "the new terms are non - renormalizable , a distinction with standard rmf models , which truncate the effective lagrangian at this level without any underlying physical justification .",
    "a chiral effective lagrangian has been derived by furnstahl , serot , and tang  @xcite , which incorporates a non - linear realization of chirial symmetry and uses the lowest lying hadronic levels : i ) pions , whose field appears as the phase of a chiral rotation of the identity matrix , ii ) nucleons , described by isospinor field n , iii ) an isoscalar - vector field , whose mass is taken to be equal to the @xmath6-meson mass and iv ) an isoscalar - scalar field which simulates correlated two - pion exchange with an effective mass around 500 mev , and v ) an isovector field , the @xmath7-meson , to take into account the symmetry energy in nuclei . by applying the relativistic mean - field approximation , a set of equations of motion",
    "can be derived from the effective lagrangian in which the meson fields act as classical fields .",
    "the connection to dft is made by considering the expansion of the relativistic mean - field lagrangian as an expansion of the energy functional of the nuclear many - body problem in terms of nucleon densities and auxiliary classical meson fields .",
    "according to the principles of dft  @xcite , knowledge of the exact energy functional can be used , by optimizing it with respect to the fermion densities and auxiliary potentials , to calculate the exact ground - state scalar and vector densities , energy , and chemical potential for the fully interacting many - fermion system  @xcite .",
    "these optimal observables are used here to compare the experimental values with the calculated ones .",
    "other observables are not expected to be well reproduced , but a comparison with some of them is included in this paper in order to understand the extent to which the theory can be applied , as well as to find new directions in which more work needs to be done . in this way the eft principles combined with dft methods give an approach to the nuclear many - body problem that uses the simplicity of solving the self - consistent hartree equations in which new contributions coming from the interacting fields can be incorporated in a systematic and controlled way .",
    "the expansion parameters that make the truncation of the effective lagrangian possible in the nuclear structure case are essentially the ratios of mean isoscalar , scalar and vector fields to the nucleon mass @xmath8 and the ratio of the fermi momentum to the nucleon mass @xmath9 .",
    "in this paper we study the _ convergence _ of the chiral effective lagrangian ( cel ) approach to the nuclear many - body problem when extrapolated to selected doubly - magic nuclei far from the @xmath2-stability region .",
    "the study focuses at how well additional levels of approximation of the energy functional reproduce the above ground - state properties of the selected , spherical , doubly - magic nuclei .",
    "in addition to this , we also examine the effect of fitting a larger set of observables , in the mean , along the stability line .",
    "we center our attention on the four doubly - magic nuclei @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 chosen for their relevance to the nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "here we compare the predictions of the cel model at various levels of approximation with the most recent experimental results for these nuclei .",
    "we compare results of nuclear binding energies for these nuclei and also extend this analysis to neighboring nuclei that differ by one particle or one hole from the doubly - magic nuclei thus comparing the values of the chemical potential .",
    "we find in both cases remarkable agreement with recent experimental data .",
    "in addition to this we look at the convergence for single - particle levels , both for neutrons and protons .",
    "we examine how sensitive these calculated spectra are to the various levels of approximation in the cel , as new interaction terms come into play .",
    "nuclear densities are also shown for the `` proton rich '' nucleus @xmath4 and the neutron rich one @xmath3 .",
    "these densities are in very good agreement with other calculations  @xcite using the relativistic hartree bogoliubov equations . according to the eft approach used here",
    ", the systematic inclusion of interaction terms will approach the _ true energy functional _ , going beyond the hartree level and including exchange - correlation terms .",
    "thus , here we include additional pairing interactions only to the extent they are systematically included through the additional terms in the cel and the fitting of the constants .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study how well the current level of approximation in the cel reproduces the ground - state properties of the selected nuclei without explicit use of the pairing interactions .",
    "the calculations are done using an independently developed code , which solves the self - consistent hartree equations at any level of approximation .",
    "the code has been tested successfully by reproducing previous calculations .",
    "the coupling constants , for each level of approximation , were obtained by furnstahl , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite by fitting in the mean to properties of stable doubly - magic nuclei leading to different parameter sets according to the level of approximation  @xcite .",
    "we use here these results and use the same name for the parameter sets , i.e. w1 , q1 , q2 , g1 and g2 in increasing level of approximation , respectively . in addition to these , we include two additional sets : l2 and nlc",
    ". the parameter set l2 corresponds to the same level of approximation as the set w1 , it contains no non - linear terms in the meson fields .",
    "the other parameter set , nlc , has the same level of approximation as q1 .",
    "both l2 and nlc were fit to describe different nuclear properties than those corresponding to the sets w1 , q1 , q2 , g1 and g2 .",
    "they also differ from these in the number of nuclei used to fit the parameters .",
    "the values of the constants used in this paper are given in table  [ tab : parms ] , and the fitting procedure is discussed in more detail later in this paper .",
    "other approaches have been applied to studies of nuclei far from stability with various degrees of success .",
    "neutron and proton skin formation , the reduction of the spin - orbit interaction and the realization of pseudo - spin symmetry are some of the phenomena studied recently by various authors  @xcite .",
    "shell - model calculations using the cd - bonn effective potential modified by the g - matrix and renormalized using the q - box method have been used to study the importance of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 partial waves in reproducing the constancy of the @xmath14 level spacing which is apparent in sb nuclei  @xcite .",
    "some of the methods that have been tested on these nuclei with various degrees of success are the density dependent relativistic hartree ( ddrh )  @xcite , relativistic continuum hartree bogoliubov ( rchb )  @xcite , relativistic hartree bogoliubov ( rhb )  @xcite , hartree - fock - bogoliubov  @xcite and relativistic dirac - hartree - bogoliubov ( dhb )  @xcite . in these methods pairing correlations",
    "have been taken into account using a phenomenological force like the gogny force  @xcite or a density - dependent zero - range interaction  @xcite .",
    "other authors  @xcite used the bcs approach with a constant pairing strength to take into account the effects of the continuum .",
    "perhaps the most self - consistent approach has been the use of the rhb , in which ph - interactions and pairing correlations have been taken into account in a unified way by solving self - consistently the rhb - equations with the klein - gordon equations that describe the meson fields  @xcite .",
    "other authors have derived new parameter sets of known potentials , e.g. nilsson  @xcite , groningen  @xcite , to fit the new experimental data of binding energies , single - particle levels , and nuclear radii for these nuclei far from stability .",
    "relativistic mean field models ( rmf ) , which have been successful in describing bulk properties of stable nuclei , are being tested in these new regimes .",
    "some of the models use the @xmath15 lagrangian with linear and non - linear @xmath5 interactions  @xcite .",
    "applications of dft to the nuclear many - body problem have been carried out using the qhd - i and qhd - ii lagrangians  @xcite . here",
    "the exchange - correlations are taken directly from the applications of many - body techniques in infinite nuclear matter , but extensions to nuclei far from stability have not yet been performed in this approach .",
    "direct application of the qhd - ii lagrangian to the doubly - magic sn isotopes to calclulate single - particle level spectrum and nucleon densities can be found in  @xcite .    the combination of the fundamental idea of dft and the realization that an approximation to the exact energy functional can be derived using eft methods is a new approach to the nuclear many - body problem . as such",
    ", it is still in development . to the extent that a sufficient number of terms are retained in the effective lagrangian to provide the correct energy functional ,",
    "one has actually developed the effective field theory for qcd at the nuclear density domain .",
    "extensions to other density regimes still has to be explored .",
    "this paper explores how additional terms in the effective lagrangian contribute to the results for ground - state properties of selected nuclei far from stability .",
    "the eft methods in this chiral effective lagrangian approach have already shown that the coupling constants are all natural  @xcite , therefore the relevant degrees of freedom have been correctly taken into account and the nda works . knowing how well this eft approach behaves at these extreme cases of nuclei far from stability",
    "will give a firmer ground for the theory .",
    "predictions for the properties of these nuclei is also , of course , of direct relevance to experiments , both ongoing and planned  @xcite , and to element formation in supernovas .    in this paper",
    "we see that the increasing level of approximation approaches the total binding energy of the selected nuclei .",
    "there is also very good agreement with the binding energies of neighboring nuclei , which differ by one particle or one hole from the doubly - magic nucleus , i.e. the chemical potential .",
    "the spins and parities of these nuclei , to the extent to which they have been measured , are also correctly given .",
    "in addition , we show the calculated single - particle excitation spectra and examine the effects of additional levels of approximation . finally , we present the nucleon densities for neutron rich and neutron deficient nuclei predicted with this approach .",
    "the following two sections explain the effective lagrangian used in this paper and describe the calculations , and in the last two sections results are presented and conclusions are drawn .",

    "this would imply that there is indeed improved convergence overall in going from q1 to the extended parameter sets g1 and g2 , and g1 gives better results than g2 over the entire range .",
    "from this figure we can observe the effects of the accuracy of the isovector contributions to the effective lagrangian .",

    "we extended this calculations to neighboring nuclei , differing by one particle or one hole , and determined the binding energy relative to the doubly - magic one and found an overall agreement of better than 1% for the total binding energy of the doubly - magic nuclei and better than 10% for the relative binding energy of the neighboring nuclei . in this latter case , the spin and parities of the ground - states",
    "are correctly predicted .",

    "here we chose only the g2 , g1 and q1 sets since these give the best results for the total binding energy of @xmath3 . from the discussion of the dft approach",
    "we do not expect these single - particle and single - hole excitation spectra to be well reproduced , though we observe that there is a slow convergence of the results with higher levels of approximation .",
    "this might indicate the need for many more terms in the lagrangian . on the other hand the excellent agreement shown in fig  [ fig : be - sn - even - even ] for the total binding energy , and figs .",
    "[ fig : sn132-isotopes ] and [ fig : sn132-isotones ] for the ground - state properties ( i.e. chemical potential leading to the neighboring single - particle and single - hole nuclei ) suggests that the current level of approximation is enough to reproduce the ground - state observables the theory is designed for .",
    "we observe that increasing levels of approximation give better results in the level spacing , e.g. fig  [ fig : sb - levels ] though the ordering is essentially independent of the level of approximation .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath111 we do not include results for the q1 parameter set for levels above 2d5/2 .",

    "this is particularly interesting in the case of @xmath4 since there are an equal number of neutrons and protons implying that the protons are pushed out , due to the coulomb potential , forming a thin layer at the surface .",
    "in contrast , in the neutron rich case the neutrons extend far out and form a neutron layer . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn - dens - comp ] we compare the neutron densities of these two doubly - magic sn nuclei .",
    "these results are in good agreement with calculations made using other approaches  @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the nuclear properties using the dft approach do not include the contributions of pairing interactions . even though most modern calculations use some type of pairing , as mentioned before , the goal of this study is to determine the convergence of the results for the optimal observables as new interaction terms are included . extending these calculations beyond these observables",
    "gives less satisfactory results , as has been seen in the single - particle and single - hole excitation spectra of neighboring nuclei , figs  [ fig : sb - levels ] and [ fig : sn133-levels ] .",
    "although beyond the original purpose of the paper , it is interesting to compare the experimental values of the two - neutron separation energy @xmath112 for the series of nuclei @xmath4 - @xmath113 with our calculated results .",
    "we give results for g2 only , since g1 gives essentially the same values .",
    "to make a reasonable comparison , we extract the configuration energy contribution coming from the mean - fields by eliminating from the experimental data the pairing contributions .",
    "to do this we use a simple solvable pairing model  @xcite of j - dependent strength @xmath114 corresponding to a pure pairing force .",
    "the result of the model is that @xmath112 is related to the number of particles in the j - th sub - shell by the formula : @xmath115 where n is the number of particles in the j - th shell .",
    "fitting the experimental data to this formula , which indeed goes through all the experimental points , gives the values of the configuration energy @xmath116 and @xmath114 shown in table  [ tab : pairing ] .    to obtain the calculated configuration energy @xmath117 using the present approach , we calculated it using two methods .",

    "in the second case the j - th sub - shell was completely filled .",
    "we proceeded as before and caclulated the total binding energy and subtracted from it the contribution from all the lower filled shells and sub - shells .",
    "this final result was averaged by dividing it by the total number of neutrons in that j - th sub - shell , @xmath118 .",
    "both methods gave essentially the same result .",

    "the spin and parity of these nuclei , where measured , is also correctly reproduced .",
    "the effect of fitting the constants of the chiral effective lagrangian to a large number of observables greatly improves the results for the total binding energy of these nuclei far from stability .",
