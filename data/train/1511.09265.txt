    "in the realm of electronic circuits , the key role of linear resistors , capacitors , and inductances is clear .",
    "but the electronic circuits have grown to maturity since the introduction of active and _ nonlinear _ elements . indeed _ rectifiers _ , voltage limiters , bistable multivibrators , frequency mixers , etc . , are not realizable without nonlinear components such as _ diodes _ and transistors  @xcite .",
    "microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) technology has its roots in microelectronics technology , thus naturally much attention has been paid to the nonlinear behavior of mems for use in signal processing , actuation , and sensing applications  @xcite .    with the ongoing trend of miniaturizing devices to the submicron scale , the gap between surfaces may about @xmath0 . in this regime ,",
    "the casimir force  @xcite can cause tiny elements to stick together and cause devices to malfunction  @xcite .",
    "tiny elements are also susceptible to wear  @xcite , thus the operation lifetime of miniaturized machines is a concern . to remedy these problems , it has been noticed that the lateral casimir force  @xcite can intermesh noncontact parts of nanomachines  @xcite . in view of designing useful nanoscale mechanical devices ,",
    "the dependence of casimir force between bodies on their material and geometrical properties is still a subject of intense investigation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest noncontact nanomachine is composed of one sinusoidally corrugated plate ( rack ) and one sinusoidally corrugated cylinder ( pinion ) subject to an external load , see fig .",
    "the pinion experiences the lateral casimir force @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denote the corrugation wavelength , pinion displacement , and rack displacement , respectively .",

    "pinion is a nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "inspired by the electronic rectifier based on the diode , a _ mechanical rectifier _",
    "based on the casimir rack and pinion , has been proposed .",
    "it has been shown that the pinion rotates with a nonzero average velocity and works against an external load , whether the rack position versus time is a uniform  @xcite , sinusoidal  @xcite , or periodic triangular signal  @xcite .",
    "the casimir rack and pinion is not a perfect mechanical rectifier .",
    "firstly , it is not guaranteed that an arbitrary input signal can be rectified .",
    "in other words , an arbitrary motion of the rack does not necessarily leads to an _ upward _ motion of the load .",
    "secondly , the device performance may be degraded due to the thermal noise .",
    "note that the pinion is mounted on an axle which is surrounded by a fluid ( air ) .",
    "the dynamics of such a small pinion with negligible inertia is deeply influenced by the continuous bombardment of fluid molecules . according to the classic work of langevin ,",
    "the total torque on axle can be written as sum of a frictional torque and a random torque .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem expresses the noise strength in terms of the rotational friction coefficient and the temperature of the system .    , corrugation amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , mean separation @xmath9 , radii @xmath10 and @xmath11 , external load @xmath12 , and heat bath temperature @xmath13 , characterize the system . ]    here we study the effect of thermal noise on the strongly damped rack and pinion device .",
    "we assume that the rack position versus time is a periodic multiharmonic signal @xmath14 whose time average is zero . indeed by a proper choice of the number of harmonics @xmath15 , parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , any signal of period @xmath18 can be well approximated by fourier series ( [ fo ] ) .",
    "we show that in a large domain of parameter space and at room temperature , the rectifier works well .",
    "we observe an interesting phenomenon : the highly damped rack and pinion does not rectify the celebrated signal @xmath19 , but many other multiharmonic signals . indeed the device may not operate for a certain rack motion whose highest frequency is @xmath20 , but upon adding terms with a _ higher _ harmonic @xmath21 to that motion , the device lifts _ up _ the load . the practical message is clear : there is no advantage in reducing the number of harmonics of the input signal .",
    "the casimir rack and pinion shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1 ] , can be characterized with the corrugation amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath7 , corrugation wavelength @xmath2 , mean separation @xmath9 , length of the cylinder @xmath22 , radius of the cylinder @xmath10 , radius @xmath11 , and external load @xmath12 .",

    "@xmath25 quantifies the rotational friction . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the casimir torque and the external torque , respectively .",
