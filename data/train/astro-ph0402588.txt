    "the combination of cosmic microwave background anisotropy studies with observations of distant type ia supernovae and measurements of the large scale structure of the universe reveal that the energy density in our universe is dominated by dark energy ( @xmath0 ) followed by a significant contribution from matter ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "in addition to massive and weakly interacting , dark matter particles are expected to be neutral .",
    "a class of neutral lightest supersymmetric particles is a combination of gauginos and higgsinos , named the neutralino often represented by @xmath7 .",
    "a number of experiments are presently searching for the neutralino ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accelerator experiments have placed lower limits on the neutralino mass of @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "the neutralino mass in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model that can explain the dark matter density is also bounded from above , @xmath9 tev . in some constrained supersymmetric models",

    "direct searches for neutralinos that cross the earth are presently reaching the required sensitivity to probe the relevant range in parameter space of supersymmetric models .",
    "a good complement to accelerator and direct detection methods are indirect searches based on the emission from neutralino self - annihilation in astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "neutralinos self - annihilate at a rate proportional to the square of the neutralino density .",
    "thus , the highest density dark matter regions are the best candidates for indirect searches .",
    "in fact , the gc region may potentially be so dense that all neutralino models would be ruled out @xcite .",
    "this strong constraint arises in models where the super - massive black hole ( bh ) at the gc induces a strong dark matter density peak called _ the spike_. the existence of such a spike is strongly dependent on the formation history of the galactic center bh @xcite .",
    "if the bh formed adiabatically a spike would be present , while a history of major mergers would most likely not allow the survival of a spike .",
    "in contrast to the uncertain presence of a central spike in the dark matter distribution , the central bh is known to induce an accretion flow of baryonic matter around its event horizon .",
    "the accretion flow carries magnetic fields , possibly amplified to near equipartition values due to the strong compression .",
    "the distribution of electrons and positrons ( hereafter both called electrons ) produced by neutralino annihilation at the gc would also be compressed toward the bh radiating through synchrotron and inverse compton scattering off the local photon background .    by considering the injection of electrons , combined with radiative losses and adiabatic compression",
    ", we find the equilibrium spatial and spectral electron distribution and derive the expected radiation signal .",
    "we find that the synchrotron emission of electrons from neutralino annihilation ranges from radio and microwave energies up to the optical , in the central more magnetized region of the accretion flow . at low frequencies , synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa )",
    "reduces the amount of radiation transmitted outwards . the resulting signal is stronger than the observed emission in the @xmath11 to @xmath12 ghz range for the case of a spiky dark matter profile while for a pure nfw profile the emission is below the observed level . here , we do not attempt to explore all possible spike profiles in the gc region , that might originate from the adiabatic compression of different types of _ initial _ dark matter profiles . instead , we limit ourselves to the case of a spike arising from adiabatic compression of a nfw profile in the gravitational field of the massive bh at the gc ( hereafter , _ the spike case_. ) in contrast to the pure nfw profile .",
    "previous calculations of the type presented here were either incomplete or had unphysical values for some of the parameters . in particular , calculations presented in @xcite and @xcite assume a magnetic field that does not correspond to the equipartition field for the accretion flow around the black hole .",
    "we show here that if this _ incorrect _ field is adopted , then the main processes responsible for reaching the equilibrium of relativistic electrons are synchrotron self - compton scattering ( ssc ) and adiabatic compression of the particles advected with the accretion flow , processes which were both ignored in previous calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the _ correct _ magnetic field is adopted , the equilibrium distribution of the radiating electrons is determined by advection and synchrotron emission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : spatial ] we describe the spatial distribution of dark matter in the gc region . in  [ sec : accret ] we describe the accretion flow around the bh and its magnetic field .",
    "the injection of electrons and positrons from neutralino annihilation is considered in  [ sec : inj ] . in  [ sec : equi ] we solve the transport equation for electron - positron pairs from neutralino annihilation in the presence of energy losses and adiabatic compression .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption is discussed in ",

    "results of our calculations and comparison with observations are shown in  [ sec : results ] and comparison with previous work is made in  [ sec : prev ] .",

    "the spatial distribution of dark matter in halos is still a matter of much debate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that collisionless dark matter forms cuspy halos while some observations argue for a flat inner density profile @xcite .",
    "the standard numerical dark matter halo is the nfw profile @xcite which is expected to be universal .",
    "however , recent simulations have found more cuspy halos @xcite as well as shallower profiles @xcite . at present , it is not clear that there is a universal dark matter halo profile , but the nfw case seems to represent well the range of plausible profiles .",
    "therefore , we assume that the nfw profile describes well the dark matter in our galaxy",
    ".    the nfw profile can be parametrized as @xmath13 ^ 2}. \\label{eq : nfw}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the core radius and @xmath15 is a normalization constant .",
    "the two free parameters can be determined from the total mass of the galaxy ( that we take to be @xmath16 ) and the velocity dispersion at the solar location which gives @xmath17 for @xmath18 kpc .",
    "there is now growing evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole at the galactic center , with mass @xmath19 .",
    "in fact most galaxies seem to harbor central black holes with comparable or even larger masses .",
    "the presence of a bh can steepen the density profile of dark matter by transforming the cusp at the gc into a spike of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the density profile of the spike region , where the gravitational potential is dominated by the bh is described by @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the slope of the density profile of dark matter in the inner region ( @xmath22 for a nfw profile ) , and @xmath23 . the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be calculated numerically as explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to identify a spike radius @xmath26 where the spike density profile given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spike ] ) matches the nfw dark matter profile .",
    "in other words , at @xmath26 the gravitational potential is no longer dominated by the central bh .",
    "neutralino annihilations affect the density profile in the spike by generating a flattening where the annihilation time becomes smaller than the age of the bh .",
    "this flattening occurs at the position @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the thermally averaged cross section times velocity for neutralino annihilation .",
    "cosmological arguments give estimates of @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of annihilations on the spike density profile can be written as @xmath30 which accounts for the flattening in the central region .",
    "several dynamical effects may weaken or destroy the spike in the gc @xcite , depending on the history of formation of the central bh .",
    "if the spike is not formed or gets destroyed , the central region should be described by the cuspy profile as in the nfw case .",
    "here we consider both cases and show that the observed emission is stronger than the predictions for a nfw cusp , while the spike generates a signal well above the observed data .",
    "we model the accretion flow of gas onto the black hole at the center of our galaxy following a simple approach described in @xcite .",
    "more detailed models of the accretion flow around the bh lead to corrections which are negligible when compared to the uncertainties in the dark matter distribution . in the model",
    "we adopt , the bh accretes its fuel from a nearby molecular cloud , located at about @xmath31 pc from the bh .",
    "the accretion is assumed to be spherically symmetric bondi accretion with a rate of mass accretion of @xmath32 .",
    "the accretion onto the bh occurs with a velocity around the free - fall velocity , such that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gravitational radius of the bh and @xmath35 is the bh mass . therefore , @xmath36 mass conservation then gives the following density profile : @xmath37 such that @xmath38    following @xcite , we assume that the magnetic field in the accretion flow achieves its equipartition value with the kinetic pressure , namely @xmath39 . with this assumption , @xmath40    it is believed that magnetic fields in the accretion flow will in general reach the equipartition values described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnetic ] ) .",
    "however , smaller fields may be reached if the equipartition is prevented somehow .",
    "in fact , previous authors @xcite have assumed a lower field given by @xmath41 although this field was actually referred to as the _ equipartition field_. in what follows , we assume the equipartition field as calculated in eq . ( [ eq : magnetic ] ) , and derive the signal from neutralino annihilation . in  [ sec : prev ] , we address the case of assuming a lower filed such as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowb ] ) .",
    "neutralino annihilations can result in many different final states ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . given the large uncertainties in the dark matter distribution , we chose to make the simplifying assumption that the annihilation channels are dominated by quarks and antiquarks , which in turn generate mainly pions : @xmath42 approximately @xmath43 of the pions are neutral and promptly decay to gamma rays .",
    "about @xmath44 of the pions are charged and result in the production of electrons , positrons and neutrinos .",
    "although much attention has been devoted in the past literature to the gamma rays from @xmath45 decays , electrons and positrons can result in copious production of nonthermal radiation in the presence of magnetic fields and a photon background .",
    "we simplify the annihilation treatment further by assuming that the spectrum of charged pions in a single neutralino annihilation is described by the hill @xcite quark fragmentation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : frag ] ) , a @xmath44 factor accounts for the fraction of charged pions compared to neutral ( @xmath43 ) in each neutralino annihilation event , and a factor @xmath48 accounts for two jets , each with energy @xmath49 , the neutralino mass . with these simplifying assumptions",
    ", the spectrum of generated electrons appears to possess the main features found with a full treatment of the neutralino annihilations ( see @xcite for a description of the full calculation ) , although the latter should be used for a more quantitative description of the particle physics aspects of the problem .",
    "the spectrum of electrons ( and positrons ) from the @xmath50 decays is calculated by convoluting the spectrum of pions and muons . for relativistic electrons",
    "the electron spectrum reads    @xmath51      finally , the injection of new electrons at the distance @xmath61 from the bh at energy @xmath62 can be written as follows : @xmath63 where the density of dark matter has the profile @xmath64 discussed in ",
    "[ sec : spatial ] , with or without a spike . in this equation ,",
    "the factor @xmath65 is introduced to avoid double counting of the annihilating neutralinos , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of particles at a position @xmath61 in the accretion flow around the bh is the result of the injection of newly produced electrons at the same position , radiative losses of these electrons , and the adiabatic compression that may enhance their momentum as they move inward .",
    "here we neglect spatial diffusion , which occurs on larger time scales .",

    "if ics off a fixed background is not dominant at large radii , it becomes even less important at small radii when compared to synchrotron losses .",
    "consequently , we safely neglect the role of ics off photons of fixed photon backgrounds .",
    "the electrons , radiating in the strong magnetic field near the bh generate a photon background that can become quite intense .",
    "the rate of losses due to ics of electrons off the photons generated through synchrotron emission by the same electrons is @xmath96 where the photon energy density generally depends on the radius @xmath61 .",

    "( [ eq : transport ] ) depends on @xmath67 when synchrotron self - compton scattering is included .",
    "if this contribution can not be neglected , an analytical solution of the transport equation becomes unattainable .",
    "given the distribution function @xmath67 , one can calculate the synchrotron emissivity @xmath99 ( energy per unit volume , per unit frequency , per unit time ) .",

    "the opposite happens when the electrons are injected at momenta larger than @xmath115 , since synchrotron losses are important from the time of injection .",
    "the momentum @xmath115 can be interpreted as the momentum where the two competing effects of adiabatic heating and synchrotron losses balance each other .",
    "thus , particles accumulate at momentum @xmath115 .",
    "this phenomenon depends on the distance from the gc : at large distances from the bh the momentum @xmath115 , which scales linearly with radius , is large and the local rate of injected electrons is low , therefore , the accumulation is small . at small distances the accumulations at @xmath115",
    "becomes more evident .",

    "this conclusion qualitatively confirms what found in previous studies @xcite , although the magnetic field and radiative transfer here are significantly different from what was assumed in @xcite , which results in numerically different conclusions ( see next section for a more detailed discussion of the comparison of our results with those obtained in previous literature ) .",

    "constraints @xmath117 [ 37 gev , 7 tev ] and @xmath118 .",
    "since the luminosity scales with the neutralino mass and the annihilation cross section through the electron density , and @xmath119 , the luminosity we calculated can be lowered by more than two orders of magnitude when @xmath120 is increased from 100 gev to 7 tev .",
    "the luminosity increases linearly for a fixed @xmath120 as @xmath121 increases .",
    "a factor of 30 increase is within the allowed parameters as @xmath121 is changed from @xmath122 @xmath123/s to @xmath124 @xmath123/s .",
    "exploring the parameter space can change our results from the fiducial choices ( 100 gev , @xmath122 @xmath123/s ) by two orders of magnitude in either direction .",
    "the large enhancement of the neutralino density due to the spiky profile produces a synchrotron luminosity that is difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "moreover , this conclusion only gets stronger when advection is included .",
    "the ssa effect does not affect the discrepancy between a neutralino spike and the observations , since it changes the luminosity only at frequencies in the range @xmath125 hz .",
    "the situation is completely different for the case of the nfw density profile . in this case",
    ", the synchrotron luminosity is always less than the experimental data as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnu2 ] .",

    "less extreme spikes can be generated if the dark matter is initially distributed in a shallower manner compared with the nfw profile .",
    "on the other hand , there are cuspier original profiles , such as the moore et al . profile ( which scales as @xmath127 ) .",

    "( [ eq : syn ] ) : ignoring the contribution of advection results in the incorrect prediction for the luminosity of the generated radiations .    another important point in the comparison with the results of @xcite",
