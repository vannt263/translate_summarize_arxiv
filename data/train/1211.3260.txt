    "a study of the top quark physics contributes to the understanding of the origin of the electro - weak symmetry breaking in the standard model and its extensions .",
    "progress in this field from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a top quark factory , has been reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "higher - order calculations of top production and decay processes were summarized in  @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "especially , observables related to the spin of a top quark may reveal various new physics effects , which can be explored at lhc ( for recent references , refer to @xcite ) .",
    "since a top quark decays almost @xmath1 into a @xmath0 quark and a @xmath2 boson before hadronization , one can extract the information on the spin of a `` bare top quark '' from the angular distribution of its decay products .",
    "for this purpose , the spin analyzing power @xmath3 for a final state @xmath4 in a polarized top quark decay has been defined via @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the partial decay width , @xmath7 is the polarization vector of a polarized ensemble of top quarks at rest with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the angle of the particle momentum measured from the top quark spin .",
    "that is , @xmath3 relates the top quark spin to the angular distribution of the decay product @xmath4 .",
    "qcd corrections to the polarized @xmath10 decay were investigated in  @xcite , and those to the spin analyzing power were done for semi - leptonic decays in  @xcite , and for hadronic decays in  @xcite .",
    "the results have been summarized in table 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite : charged leptons and down - type quarks exhibit the largest power ( @xmath11 ) , a bottom quark has a second - largest power ( @xmath12 ) , neutrinos and up - type quarks have a value of @xmath13 , and the less energetic non-@xmath0 jet shows @xmath14  @xcite . it was observed that next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the spin analyzing power are not important , and the @xmath0 quark mass could be safely ignored in the above analysis of the polarized top quark decay  @xcite .",
    "although the light - particle jets from the @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks have been considered , the spin analyzing power associated with the @xmath0-quark jet is not known yet . in particular , a jet mass can be measured , so it is interesting to examine how the spin analyzing power for a polarized top quark depends on the @xmath0-quark jet mass .",
    "this is the motivation of the present work .",
    "a fundamental framework for studying high - energy processes is the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) factorization theorem  @xcite , in which cross sections and decay widths are factorized into convolutions of several subprocesses .",
    "take top quark decays as an example .",
    "the subprocesses include jet functions which contain infrared radiations associated with energetic hadronic final states , soft functions which collect infrared gluons exchanged among the top quark and hadronic final states , and heavy - quark kernels from the difference between the qcd diagrams for the top quark decays and the effective diagrams for the jet and soft functions . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate the factorization of the @xmath0-quark jet from the semi - leptonic top quark decay , that requires the eikonal approximation for particle propagators in infrared regions and on the ward identity for organizing all diagrams with attachments of infrared gluons @xcite .",
    "the soft functions will be neglected here due to the cancellation between virtual and real corrections , and to the fact that they have minor effects on jet mass distributions . the pqcd factorization formula for the semi - leptonic decay of a polarized top quark is then expressed as a convolution of the infrared - finite heavy - quark kernel with the @xmath0-quark jet function .",
    "it has been known that the overlap of collinear and soft dynamics produces large double logarithms in a jet function , which should be summed up to all orders .",
    "references on the resummation of various double logarithms can be found in  @xcite .",
    "recently , the qcd resummation technique for light - particle jets have been developed  @xcite , by means of which jet substructures , such as jet mass distributions and energy profiles , can be calculated . substituting the quark jet function derived in  @xcite into the pqcd factorization formula for the polarized top quark decay ,",
    "we show that the spin analyzing power increases with the jet mass quickly , and is possibly enhanced by a factor 2 in a wide range of the jet mass .",
    "this result is attributed to the observation that the shape of the jet function puts more weight on the contribution from the kinematic region with higher @xmath0-quark jet momentum , where the spin analyzing power is larger .",
    "it is worthwhile to test experimentally the enhancement of the spin analyzing power due to the inclusion of jet dynamics .",
    "the pqcd factorization of the @xmath0-quark jet function from the semi - leptonic decay of a polarized top quark is performed up to nlo by employing the eikonal approximation in sec .",
    "the procedures that rely on the application of the ward identity for the all - order factorization are outlined .",
    "the doubly differential width for the angular distribution of the @xmath0-quark jet with a specified invariant mass is presented in sec .",
    "we propose a parametrization for the quark jet function derived in @xcite in order to simplify numerical analysis .",
    "the choices of physical parameters and our predictions are summarized .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] is devoted to a conclusion .",
    "we consider the semi - leptonic top quark decay @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the momenta of the top quark , the @xmath0 quark , the charged lepton , and the neutrino , respectively , as indicated in fig .  [ fig1 ] for the leading - order ( lo ) amplitude . in this section",
    "we shall identify the leading infrared contributions , and perform their factorization into the @xmath0-quark jet function .",
    "the averaged decay amplitude squared @xmath22 at lo in both the electro - weak coupling and the strong coupling , depicted in fig .",

    "the three - body phase - space integral for the top quark decay is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the energy of the particle @xmath4 , @xmath37 .",
    "the angle @xmath38 is the polar angle of the @xmath0 quark with respect to the top quark spin as indicated in fig .",

    "in this paper we have performed pqcd factorization of the @xmath0-quark jet function from the semi - leptonic decay of a polarized top quark by means of the eikonal approximation and the ward identity .",
    "the resultant formula is expressed as the convolution of the infrared - finite heavy - quark kernel with the jet function , which is dominated by infrared radiations . adopting the lo heavy - quark kernel and parameterizing the jet function from qcd resummation ,",
    "we have predicted the dependence of the spin analyzing power associated with the @xmath0-quark jet on its invariant mass .",
    "it has been verified that our formalism reproduces the fixed - order results by integrating over the jet mass .",
    "our investigation indicated that the spin analyzing power could be possibly enhanced by a factor 2 as measuring the angular distribution of the @xmath0-quark jet with a specified invariant mass .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the enhancement has been elaborated , which is attributed to the broadening of a jet in the mass distribution with the jet energy .",
    "this broadening puts more weight on the contribution from the region with higher jet energy , that intends to give a larger spin analyzing power .",
    "the above observation is rather insensitive to the choice of the jet radius , and worth of experimental confrontation in view of deeper understanding of the effect from including jet dynamics into the polarized top quark decay .    as future works , nlo corrections to the heavy - quark kernel",
    "need to be taken into account in order to improve the precision of our predictions . at this level ,",
    "the dependence of the top quark mass definition on renormalization schemes ( for instance , the @xmath44 mass @xcite or the pole mass ) , becomes an essential issue .",
    "it is possible to extend the current formalism to hadronic decays of a polarized top quark , whose analysis is more complicated .",
    "another important direction is to develop the formalism for a boosted top quark at lhc @xcite , that mainly decays into a single jet .",
    "substructures for a polarized top quark jet , which improve the extraction of the information on the top quark polarization , can be calculated .",
