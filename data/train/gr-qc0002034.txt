    "boson stars are compact gravitationally bound soliton - like equilibrium configurations of bosonic fields .",
    "the simplest kind of boson star , which is made up of a self - gravitating free complex massive scalar field , was conceived over thirty years ago by kaup  @xcite and ruffini and bonazzola  @xcite who found numerically the ground state solution to the spherically symmetric einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) equations . a decade later",
    "the systematic numerical analysis of these equations was performed by friedberg , lee , and pang  @xcite who rediscovered and extended the results of  @xcite , in particular they found a countable sequence of excited states .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a rigorous proof of existence of solutions found in  @xcite . in the physics literature",
    "these solutions are usually referred to as mini - boson stars ( mini because they are tiny objects with mass @xmath0 @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the boson mass ) .",
    "what are the motivations for studying such objects ?",
    "let us mention three possible reasons varying from physical to purely mathematical .",
    "first , most theories of elementary particles predict the existence of massive bosons which interact weakly with baryonic matter . to the extent one believes in these models , one should accept their consequences , like boson stars . from this standpoint ,",
    "the recent surge of interest in boson stars is largely due to the suggestion that the dark matter could be bosonic since then some fraction of the missing mass of the universe would float around in the form of boson stars .",
    "second , even if massive scalar fields do not exist in nature , they provide one of the simplest fundamental matter sources for the einstein equations and , as such , are ideal theoretical `` laboratories '' for studying the dynamics of gravitational collapse . mathematically , these studies amount to the analysis of the cauchy problem for the ekg equations .",
    "boson stars play an important role in this context as candidates for intermediate or final attractors of dynamical evolution .",
    "finally , and admittedly most interestingly for us , mini - boson stars are _ non - perturbative _ solutions of the ekg equations in the sense that they have no regular flat - spacetime limit ( one manifestation of this property is the fact mentioned above that the total mass of a mini - boson star is inversely proportional to the gravitational constant @xmath3 ) . in this",
    "respect mini - boson stars are similar to the bartnik - mckinnon solutions of the einstein - yang - mills equations  @xcite . however ,",
    "in contrast to the bartnik - mckinnon solutions , the mini - boson stars are not static : although the metric and the stress - energy tensor of the scalar field are time - independent , the scalar field iself has the form of a standing wave @xmath4 .",
    "this fact has an important consequence at the ode level , namely the lapse function does not decouple from the klein - gordon equation and the hamiltonian constraint which means that we have to deal with a 4-dimensional ( nonautonomous ) dynamical system . below we analyze this system using a shooting method which is similar in spirit ( but quite different in implementation ) to the proof of existence of the bartnik - mckinnon solutions  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we derive the field equations together with the boundary conditions and discuss some basic properties of solutions .",
    "we also formulate the main theorem and sketch the heuristic idea of its proof . in section  3 we prove the local existence of solutions near the origin . in sections  4 and  5",
    "we discuss the limiting behavior of solutions for small and large values of the shooting parameter , respectively . in section  6",
    "we derive the asymptotics of globally regular solutions .",
    "section  7 contains some technical results concerning the behavior of singular solutions .",
    "finally , in section  8 , using the results of sections  4 - 7 , we complete the proof of the main theorem by a shooting argument .",
    "the action for the ekg system is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature of the spacetime metric @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the complex scalar field , and @xmath2 is a real constant called the boson mass .",
    "the associated field equations are the einstein equations @xmath9 with the stress - energy tensor of the scalar field @xmath10 and the klein - gordon equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dalembertian operator associated with the metric @xmath7 .",
    "now , we assume that the fields are spherically symmetric .",
    "we write the metric using areal radial coordinate and polar slicing @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the standard metric on the unit two - sphere , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of @xmath17 . in this parametrization",
    "the ( relevent components of ) einstein equations have the particularly simple form @xmath18 where the components of stress - energy tensor @xmath19 are expressed in the orthonormal frame determined by the metric ( 2.5 ) ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . from ( 2.3 ) we obtain @xmath22 the remaining components of einstein s equations are equivalent to the klein - gordon equation .    for the scalar field @xmath8 we assume the standing wave ansatz @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a real constant .",
    "then , due to the @xmath25 symmetry of the action , the stress - energy tensor and the metric are time - independent .",
    "morever , @xmath26 so eq .  ( 2.8 ) is trivially satisfied . in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath27 and the auxiliary variable @xmath28 eqs .",
    "( 2.4),(2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) reduce to the following system of ordinary differential equations ( hereafter prime denotes @xmath29 )    @xmath30    instead of @xmath15 , it is sometimes convenient to use the `` mass '' function @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 . from ( 2.14b ) we have @xmath33 a spacetime is said to be asymptotically flat if @xmath34 is finite and @xmath35 the limiting value @xmath36 is interpreted as the total mass of a solution ( in our case it is measured in units @xmath37 ) . in section  6 we will show that the finiteness of mass implies that @xmath38 has a finite limit and @xmath39 decays exponentially as @xmath40 .    besides the singularity at infinity , the field equations ( 2.14 ) have the fixed singular point at @xmath41 and a moving singularity at @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "regularity of solutions at @xmath41 requires the following behavior @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are arbitrary parameters ( assumed positive without loss of generality ) . in sect .",
    "3 we will show that these parameters determine uniquely a smooth local solution to eqs.(2.14 ) .",
    "the solution of eqs.(2.14 ) starting at @xmath41 with the behavior ( 2.17 ) is called the @xmath47 .    in the following whenever we write a solution we always mean the @xmath48-orbit . also when we write that some property holds for all @xmath49 we always mean for all @xmath50 .",
    "we will frequently refer to the behavior of @xmath48-orbits in the @xmath51-plane ; when we write , say , that the @xmath48-orbit enters the first quadrant ( q1 for brevity ) , we mean that the projection of the @xmath48-orbit in the @xmath51-plane does so .",
    "the @xmath48-orbits which exist for all @xmath49 and are asymptotically flat are called * globally regular*.    now , we are ready to formulate our main result :    for each @xmath52 , there is a decreasing sequence of parameters @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) such that the corresponding @xmath53-orbits are globally regular .",
    "the index @xmath55 labels the number of nodes of the function @xmath56 .",
    "this theorem makes rigorous the numerical results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "notice that although the @xmath48-orbits are determined by two parameters , only the parameter @xmath48 has to be fine - tuned so the shooting is essentially one - dimensional .    in order to prepare the ground for the proof of theorem  2.1 we discuss now some elementary global properties of @xmath48-orbits .",
    "@xmath57 for all @xmath58 unless @xmath59 .    from ( 2.14b ) , @xmath60 if @xmath61 so @xmath15 can not cross @xmath62 from below .",
    "since @xmath57 for small @xmath49 , the lemma follows .",
    "an @xmath48-orbit exists as long as @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath63 for @xmath64 , then @xmath65 exists ( because @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) so @xmath68 exists as well . we will show that the orbit can be continued beyond @xmath42 provided that @xmath69 . since @xmath70 , the only obstruction to extending the solution is the possibility that @xmath38,@xmath39 , or @xmath71 might be unbounded . to see that @xmath39 is bounded we note that @xmath72 .",
    "choose @xmath73 such that @xmath74 for @xmath75 ; then @xmath76 and integrating from @xmath77 gives that @xmath78 and hence , by the cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath79 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 is bounded .",
    "this implies by eq.(2.14c ) that @xmath80 is also bounded so both @xmath38 and @xmath81 are bounded .",
    "now , ( 2.14a ) says that @xmath82 is bounded so @xmath71 is bounded .",
    "it follows from lemma  2.3 that the only possible obstruction to extendability of @xmath48-orbits to arbitrarily large @xmath49 is @xmath83 for some @xmath42 .",
    "if that happens we will say that the solution _ crashes _ at @xmath84 .",
    "let us define the function @xmath85 . the following two properties of this function will play an important role in our discussion .",
    "we have    ( a ) : :    if @xmath86 , then @xmath87 ; ( b ) : :    if @xmath88 , then @xmath89 for all    @xmath90 .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath91 the part ( a ) follows immediately from ( 2.18 ) . to prove the part ( b ) note that @xmath92 if @xmath93 , so @xmath94 can not cross zero from above .",
    "0.15 cm the restriction @xmath52 in theorem  2.1 can be easily seen as follows .",
    "suppose that there is a globally regular solution with @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath96 , it follows from lemma  2.4 that @xmath97 is positive for all @xmath49 .",
    "multiplying eq.(2.14a ) by @xmath39 and integrating by parts we get that @xmath98 for all @xmath49 , hence @xmath99 is monotone increasing which is obviously impossible for globally regular solutions ( in fact such solutions crash at finite @xmath49 as follows easily from eq.(2.14b ) ) .",
    "thus we have    there are no ( nontrivial ) globally regular solutions for @xmath95 .",
    "note that lemma  2.5 implies in particular that there are no static ( @xmath100 ) globally regular solutions . in view of lemma  2.5 from now on",
    "we always assume that @xmath52 .",
    "the rotation function @xmath101 of an @xmath48-orbit is defined by @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath101 is continuous in @xmath49 .",
    "we will drop the second argument of @xmath104 if there is no danger of confusion .",
    "now we list the basic properties of the rotation function of @xmath48-orbits which we will need below .    for any nonnegative integer @xmath55",
    "we have :    ( a ) : :    if @xmath105 for some @xmath106 ,    then @xmath107 for all @xmath108 .",
    "( b ) : :    if @xmath109 for some @xmath106 and    @xmath110 , then @xmath111 for    all @xmath108 .",
    "( c ) : :    there are at most two values of @xmath49 with    @xmath112 .",
    "\\(a ) we note that @xmath113 , so @xmath114 if @xmath115 .",
    "+ ( b ) if @xmath108 and @xmath116 , then @xmath89 by lemma  2.4 .",
    "next , we note that @xmath117 if @xmath112 and @xmath89 . if @xmath118 then @xmath119 but @xmath120 since @xmath87 when @xmath118 by eq.(2.18 ) .",
    "+ ( c ) the function @xmath121 changes sign at each zero for which @xmath122 . from lemma  2.4 , @xmath94 changes sign at most once .",
    "thus , for @xmath123 , @xmath124 and at @xmath106 , the first zero of @xmath121 , if @xmath125 then by part b ) @xmath126 for all @xmath108 . if @xmath127 then @xmath121 changes sign at @xmath106 , and hence , at @xmath128 , the next zero of @xmath121 , @xmath129 and hence @xmath126 for all @xmath130 .",
    "for @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 near @xmath41 and if @xmath134 then @xmath116 , hence , @xmath135 for all @xmath108 .    before going into details of sections  38 ,",
    "let us outline the main idea of the proof of theorem  2.1 . according to this theorem there exists a countable family of globally regular solutions distinguished by nodal class .",
    "we first show ( section 3 ) that there is a continuous one - parameter family of local solutions depending on @xmath136 ; we all these solutions @xmath48-orbits . in section  6",
    "we show that an @xmath48-orbit that has bounded rotation and that is defined for all @xmath49 is a globally regular solution , that is , it has the correct asymptotic behavior as @xmath137 .",
    "the existence of @xmath48-orbits with bounded rotation that are defined for all @xmath49 is proven in each nodal class by an inductive application of a shooting argument . the zeroeth solution we construct",
    "has @xmath138 for all @xmath49 ; the first solution has @xmath139 ( and greater than @xmath140 for large @xmath49 ) , etc .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1",
    ". the crucial step of our argument is the control of behavior of @xmath48-orbits for large and small values of the parameter @xmath48 . in section  4",
    "we show that for sufficiently small @xmath48 the @xmath48-orbit has arbitrarily large rotation ; more precisely , there is a number @xmath141 such that @xmath142 for some @xmath49 if @xmath143 .",
    "in contrast , we show in section  5 that for @xmath144 the @xmath48-orbit exits q4 directly to q1 ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) .    now ,",
    "to prove the existence of a globally regular solution in the zeroeth nodal class we let @xmath145 for all @xmath49 for which the @xmath48-orbit is defined}. note that @xmath146 .",
    "we then prove that the @xmath147-orbit is the globally regular solutions in the zeroeth nodal class .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath147-orbit has rotation @xmath148 for otherwise all nearby orbits would have rotation @xmath149 which contradicts the definition of @xmath147 .",
    "it is also easy to see that the @xmath147-orbit can not exit q4 to q1 because again , nearby orbits would also do so which contradicts the definition of @xmath147 .",
    "hence , the @xmath147-orbit must stay in q4 ; it either crashes or is defined for all @xmath49 and is a globally regular solutions in the zeroeth nodal class .",
    "thus , it remains to show that the @xmath147-orbit does not crash .",
    "the ( technical ) crash lemma of section  7 shows that if an orbit crashes in q4 then nearby orbits either crash in q4 or exit q4 to q1 .",
    "thus the @xmath147-orbit can not crash because nearby orbits would all be in @xmath150 for all @xmath49 for which the @xmath48-orbit is defined } and @xmath147 would not be the infimum of that set .",
    "to show the existence of globally regular solutions in higher nodal classes we proceed as above",
    ". we let @xmath151 for all @xmath49 for which the @xmath48-orbit is defined}. we then show that @xmath152 .",
    "we again use the crash lemma as we did in the @xmath153 case to show the @xmath53-orbit is defined for all @xmath49 .",
    "the only difference is that we must show that @xmath154 .",
    "that fact follows easily from lemmas 2.6b and 6.3 .",
    "there exists a two - parameter family of local solutions of eqs.(2.14 ) near @xmath41 satisfying the initial conditions ( 2.17 ) .",
    "the proof is standard so we just outline it .",
    "we introduce new variables @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and rewrite eqs.(2.14 ) as the first order system    @xmath158    we will use the sup norm throughout this discussion : @xmath159 means the @xmath160 .",

    "@xmath161 is a complete metric space if we take as metric the maximum of the four components .",
    "we define a map @xmath167 by @xmath168 where    @xmath169    one verifies easily that @xmath170 does in fact take @xmath161 to @xmath161 and that @xmath170 is a contracting map if @xmath171 is sufficiently small , and that a fixed point of @xmath170 is a solution to our equations . the proof that the solution depends continuously on @xmath48 is also routine .",
    "in this section we show that the rotation @xmath101 of the @xmath48-orbit is arbitrarily large if @xmath48 is sufficiently small and @xmath49 is sufficiently large .    for any @xmath123 ,",
    "there exists a @xmath141 such that for @xmath172 there is an @xmath49 with @xmath173 .",
    "let @xmath174 .",

    "gives the bessel equation @xmath180 whose unique solution satisfying ( 4.2 ) is @xmath181 this solution has infinite rotation as @xmath137 .",
    "if @xmath182 then @xmath183 so for @xmath48 close to @xmath184 , say @xmath185 , we have @xmath186 because solutions of eqs.(4.1 ) are continuous in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "the rest of this section is devoted to the analysis of eqs.(5.4 ) .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath194 becomes positive at a point @xmath195 .",

    "note that the function @xmath205 decouples from eqs.(5.4bc ) for the metric coefficients  this fact considerably simplifies the analysis .",
    "the solution of eqs.(5.4 ) crashes at some @xmath206 , that is , @xmath207 .",

    "the integrability of @xmath333 and @xmath338 implies via eq.(2.15 ) that @xmath339 exists .",

    "since @xmath128 is arbitrarily large and @xmath361 , we conclude that @xmath362 .",

    "the main result of this section is the crash theorem which states that if an orbit has bounded rotation and crashes , then nearby orbits also have similarly bounded rotation .",
    "the precise statement is given in proposition  7.2 .",

    "@xmath388 for some @xmath389 with @xmath390 ; hence , for @xmath48 sufficiently near @xmath364 we have @xmath391 with @xmath392 . by lemma  2.6b , @xmath393 for all @xmath108 .",
    "part ( b ) : this case is much more difficult and will require several auxiliary results .",
    "it follows from part ( a ) that nearby orbits have rotation @xmath394 ; we must prove a much more difficult result , namely that nearby orbits have rotation @xmath387 .",
    "it is clear from numerical observations that no @xmath48-orbit crashes in q2 or q4 ; however , that appears to be quite difficult to prove .",
    "moreover , one can easily construct orbit segments that start , for example , at @xmath395 with @xmath396 , say , that crash in q4 .",
    "such orbit segments have @xmath397 .",
    "nevertheless , the next lemma shows that @xmath398 remains bounded at crash .    if an @xmath48-orbit is defined for @xmath399 for @xmath400 , @xmath401 , and @xmath402 then @xmath403 . in particular , if an orbit crashes in q2 or q4 , @xmath404 .",
    "we set @xmath405 and then compute that @xmath406 note that @xmath407 and all terms on the right side of ( 7.3 ) are negative except for the last two . if @xmath408 , we combine the term @xmath409 with @xmath410 ; clearly , @xmath411 .",

    "we can now discuss the strategy of the proof of part ( b ) of proposition  7.2 .",
    "we want to show that if an orbit is sufficiently close to an orbit that crashes in q4 then it must either crash or exit q4 to q1 ( the case in which the orbit crashes in q2 is completely symmetric ) .",

    "we will prove that @xmath428 goes to @xmath184 if @xmath48 is sufficiently close to @xmath364 and @xmath429 .",
    "this means either @xmath430 and hence the orbit is exiting q4 to q1 , or @xmath431 , that is , the orbit is crashing in q4 .",
    "note that @xmath432 . we know that @xmath433 goes to @xmath184 at crash so nearby orbits will also have @xmath205 small for @xmath49 near @xmath42 .",

    "that is , the size of the interval and the bounds work for all @xmath48 near @xmath364 .",
    "that is enough to force @xmath205 positive .",
    "the most technical part of the proof involves showing that nearby orbits stay in q4 long enough to have @xmath205 go positive .",
    "since @xmath71 goes to @xmath434 at crash , nearby orbits have @xmath71 large also .",
    "now , ( 2.14a ) can be written as @xmath435 ; moreover , to get to q3 orbits must pass through @xmath436 which means that the coefficient of @xmath71 , @xmath437 , is positive .",
    "that is enough to bound @xmath71 .",
    "the details of the proof , especially lemma  7.5 , are tedious .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to an interval @xmath438 and replace @xmath49 by @xmath42 ( whenever justified ) in making estimates .",
    "we show next that if the @xmath364-orbit crashes at @xmath381 with rotation @xmath439 then @xmath440 .    if the @xmath364-orbit crashes at @xmath381 with @xmath441 for all @xmath442 and @xmath443 for @xmath49 near @xmath42 , then @xmath444 , in particular @xmath445 .",
    "the assumption on @xmath446 tells us that the orbit lies in q2 or q4 for @xmath49 near @xmath42 . for simplicity of exposition",

    "then , from ( 2.14b ) , @xmath455 , we see that @xmath456 near @xmath42 so there is no crash .",
    "this is a contradiction so we conclude that @xmath457 and hence @xmath458 .",
