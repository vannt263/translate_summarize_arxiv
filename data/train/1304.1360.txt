    "the recent discovery @xcite of a relatively large @xmath1 , together with an indication that atmospheric neutrino mixing is not maximal , has had a significant impact on attempts at understanding the principle , if any , behind the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing . until recently ,",
    "leptonic mixing was in agreement with the ansatz of tri - bi - maximal mixing ( tbm ) @xcite in the leptonic sector , which in turn triggered the suggestion of various family symmetries like @xmath8 @xcite which can lead to tbm .",
    "since in this ansatz @xmath1  vanishes , the recent discovery of a relatively large @xmath1 , rules out the tbm scheme .",
    "this has led to an intense activity in the construction of models which can accommodate a non - vanishing @xmath1 , within a variety of frameworks @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the recent data on leptonic mixing enforces the idea that in fact there is no symmetry principle behind the observed leptonic mixing and instead anarchy @xcite prevails with the mixing arising from a random distribution of unitary @xmath9 matrices ..    in this paper instead of anarchy , we advocate the principle of universal democracy ( ud ) for fermion masses and mixing , with ud prevailing both in the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "the ud principle reflects the presence of a @xmath10 family symmetry , which leads in leading order to fermion mass matrices proportional to the so - called democratic flavour structure , where all matrix elements have equal value .",
    "previously , the democratic flavour structure has been applied to the quark sector @xcite ; here we point out that starting with the same democratic flavour structure for all leptonic mass matrices , namely charged lepton , dirac neutrino and right - handed majorana mass matrices , one can reproduce the observed pattern of leptonic masses and mixing , accommodating in particular the recently measured value of @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the ud framework . in section 3",
    ", we show how to obtain natural democracy through a @xmath10 family symmetry and discuss both the quark and lepton mixing .",
    "our numerical results are combined in section 4 and in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we suggest that all fermion mass matrices are in leading order proportional to the so - called democratic matrix , denoted by @xmath11 , with all elements equal to the unit : @xmath12   \\label{demod}\\ ] ]    for simplicity , we assume that the neutrino masses are generated in the framework of an extension of the standard model ( sm ) , consisting of the addition of three right - handed neutrinos to the spectrum of the sm :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 denote the left handed lepton and higgs doublets , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 the right handed charged lepton and neutrino singlets .",
    "this automatically leads , through the seesaw mechanism @xcite to an effective neutrino mass matrix at low energies , with naturally small neutrino masses . in the ud framework ,",
    "the fermion mass matrices have the form :    * quark sector : * @xmath18 \\\\   \\\\   m_{u}=c_{u}\\ \\left [ \\delta + \\varepsilon _ { u}\\ p_{u}\\right]\\end{array } \\label{quark}\\ ] ]    * lepton sector : * @xmath19 &   &   \\\\   &   &",
    "\\\\   m_{_{d}}=c_{_{d}}\\ \\left [ \\delta + \\varepsilon _ { _ { d}}\\ p_{_{d}}\\right ] &   &   m_{_{r}}=c_{_{r}}\\ \\left [ \\delta + \\varepsilon _ { _ { r}}\\ p_{_{r}}\\right]\\end{array } \\label{pertu}\\]]where the notation is self - explanatory . in particular , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are over - all constants , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 denote the charged lepton mass matrix , and neutrino dirac and right - handed neutrino mass matrices , respectively . finally , the @xmath26 denote small perturbations  to universal democracy .    in order for universal democracy to satisfy thooft naturalness principle @xcite",
    ", there should be a symmetry of the lagrangian which leads to exact ud . in the quark sector , it is straightforward to find a symmetry which leads to ud . in particular , since all quarks enter on equal footing in the gauge sector , it is natural to assume that in leading order the yukawa couplings obey a @xmath27 family permutation symmetry , acting on the left - handed quark doublets , the right - handed up quarks and right - handed down quarks , respectively .",
    "it is clear that this symmetry leads to ud in the quark sector .",
    "however , in the lepton sector , and taking into account the observed large leptonic mixing , the ud extension is not straightforward . for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider that there is a lepton number violation mechanism at high energies leading at low energies to the effective majorana mass term for the light neutrinos .",
    "if one trivially extends to the lepton sector the above symmetry by considering a @xmath28 acting on the lepton doublets and charged leptons , one obtains a charged lepton mass matrix proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "however , the effective neutrino majorana mass matrix is then proportional to @xmath29 , where one expects @xmath30 , @xmath31 to be of the same order , since both terms are allowed by the family symmetry .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that no large leptonic mixing can be obtained in this case .    in the next section ,",
    "we explore the possibility of obtaining the observed quark and leptonic mixing , including the results of the daya - bay experiment , through a small perturbation of a @xmath10 symmetry imposed on the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "this @xmath10 symmetry leads to ud in leading order in all fermion sectors .",
    "we impose a @xmath10 family symmetry on the lagrangean , realized in the following way .    * * quark sector:**@xmath32   \\label{qsym}\\]]where @xmath33 .",
    "it can be readily verified that this is indeed a @xmath10 symmetry since @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "then , the lagrangean , and in particular the quark mass terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are invariant , if the quark mass matrices @xmath38 obey the following relation@xmath39notice that we do not have @xmath40 .",
    "it is crucial for our results that eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) holds and it immediately follows that @xmath41 , since @xmath42 is not real .",
    "thus , @xmath43 must have one or more zero eigenvalues , and in @xcite it was indeed shown that @xmath43 is proportional to the democratic matrix @xmath11 .    * lepton sector : *    in the lepton sector , we impose the @xmath10 symmetry in exactly the same way : @xmath44    it is clear that for a @xmath10 symmetry realized in the way indicated in eqs .",
    "( [ qsym ] , [ sym ] , [ z3 ] ) , all fermion mass matrices , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , in the exact @xmath10 limit , @xmath25 will not contain a term @xmath47 , since this term is not allowed by the @xmath48 symmetry .",
    "significant features of the observed pattern of quark masses and mixing include hierarchical quark masses , small mixing and the observed alignment between the spectrum of the masses in the up and down quark sectors .",
    "this observed alignment is rarely mentioned in the literature and yet it is an important feature observed in the quark sector .",
    "so it is worth defining in a precise manner what alignment means .",
    "let us consider a set of quark mass matrices @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the quark masses are hierachical and the mixing is small .",
    "small mixing means that there is a weak - basis where both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are close to a diagonal matrix . even for this set of matrices , and taking into account that",
    "in the sm , the yukawa couplings for the up and down quark sectors are entirely independent , it is as likely that in the basis where @xmath46 is close to @xmath49 , @xmath45 is close to @xmath50 , meaning alignment , as in contrast having @xmath45 close to @xmath51 meaning misalignment .",
    "note that the ordering in one of the sectors is arbitrary , but the relative ordering is physically meaningful . for a set of random matrices ,",
    "even if one assumes hierarchical masses and small mixing , the probability of having alignment is only 1/6 . for a set of arbitrary masses",
    ", one can verify whether one has small mixing and alignment through the use of weak - basis invariants align .    in order to see this , it is convenient to define the dimensionless matrices with unit trace : @xmath52 }   \\label{tr1}\\]]where @xmath53  and similarly for @xmath54 .",
    "as we have previously mentioned , alignment means that in the weak - basis where @xmath55 , @xmath54 is close to @xmath56 . then defining @xmath57 and taking into account that @xmath58 by construction , in turn implying that @xmath59 $ ] , one can show that the condition for alignment is @xmath60where @xmath61 is the second invariant of @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 , with the @xmath64 denoting the eigenvalues of @xmath62 . in order to see that the condition eq .",
    "( [ apchi ] ) leads to alignment , consider the limit where @xmath65 go to infinity .",
    "assuming alignment , one has @xmath66 ) so that @xmath67 .",
    "if one considers instead that there is small mixing but no alignment , then in the weak - basis where @xmath55 , one may have @xmath54 close to @xmath68 .",
    "one can check that in this case @xmath69 , indicating total misalignment . a very interesting feature of universal democracy is the fact that a small perturbation of ud as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ quark ] ) , automatically leads to alignment of the heaviest generation .",
    "alignment of the two light generations depends , of course , on the specific breaking of ud through @xmath70 , @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ quark ] ) .",
    "it is indeed a salient feature of the universal democracy hypothesis for the quark sector @xcite that it guarantees exactly these two important phenomenological properties : small mixing and alignment .",
    "a breaking of @xmath10 generates leptonic mass matrices of the form of eq .",
    "( [ pertu ] ) , where the @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and the @xmath74 are of order @xmath75 .",
    "we assume that the perturbation @xmath76 of the right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos is such that the inverse of @xmath77 exists , and we find that generically @xmath78 ^{-1}$]is of the form : @xmath79 ^{-1}=\\frac{c_{_{p}}}{\\varepsilon _ { _ { r}}\\ } \\ \\left [ l+\\varepsilon _ { _ { r}}\\ q\\right ] \\quad ;",
    "\\quad \\quad c_{_{p}}=\\frac{1}{q+\\varepsilon _ { _ { r}}\\ p }   \\label{inp1}\\]]where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are cubic and quadratic polynomials in the elements @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 are matrices with respectively linear and quadratic elements in the @xmath82 . obviously @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath83 and @xmath84 are in general of order @xmath75",
    "it is possible to have special cases where either @xmath80 or @xmath87 vanish , but not both , since we require that the inverse of @xmath88 exists .",
    "furthermore , it is a general characteristic of this inverse that the linear matrix @xmath83 and the quadratic matrix @xmath84 satisfy the relations : @xmath89applying these algebraic relations to the effective neutrino mass matrix formula one obtains a transparent formula for @xmath90 : @xmath91 + \\frac{\\varepsilon _ { d}^{2}\\ } { \\varepsilon _ { r}}\\ p_{_{d}}\\ l\\ p_{_{d}}^{t}\\right)\\end{array } \\label{meff}\\]]with @xmath92 .",
    "this expression obtained for the effective neutrino mass matrix tells us when to expect large mixing for the lepton sector in the case of an aligned hierachical spectrum for the charged leptons , as well as for the dirac and heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "in general , i.e. , for a generic perturbation @xmath76 in the right - handed majorana sector , there will be more than one element @xmath82 of order one , thus implying that the quadratic polynomial @xmath81 is also of order one .",
    "so , if the term in @xmath90 proportional to @xmath93 is small , it is clear that the effective neutrino mass matrix will be , just like the charged lepton mass matrix , to leading order , proportional to @xmath11 , and , thus , there will be no large mixing .",
    "therefore , if one wants to avoid small mixing , one must have the term proportional to @xmath94 , in eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , to be of order one or larger .",
    "next , we give a numerical analysis of our model . in particular , we give a specific point in parameter space which exhibits all features described here and is in excellent agreement with the experimental evidence and in particular with the recent daya - bay result . in accordance with the universal democracy hypothesis , given in eq .",
    "( [ pertu ] ) , we write the leptonic mass matrices as proportional to @xmath11 plus some matrix with elements of order of a power in @xmath95 .    for the charged lepton mass matrix , we have @xmath96 , $ ] where ,    @xmath97    for the neutrino dirac and right - handed mass matrices , we have : @xmath98 \\quad ; \\quad m_{_{r}}=c_{_{r}}\\ \\left [ \\delta + \\lambda ^{3}\\ p_{_{r}}\\right ]   \\label{numl}\\ ] ]    where@xmath99and @xmath100with@xmath101with these , we obtain the following physical observables : charged lepton , light neutrino masses and heavy majorana neutrinos:@xmath102and mixing    @xmath103    note that all observables are within the experimental bounds , in particular we have a sufficient large @xmath104 , in agreement with the recent daya - bay experimental results .",
    "we have also a large hierarchy for the heavy majorana neutrinos due to the perturbation term in @xmath25 , which is proportional to higher power in @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( numl ) .",
    "in addition to this point , we have explored a stable region in parameter space around this point which is in agreement with experiment .",
    "this was done using a numerical analysis with a monte carlo type algorithm .",
    "we generated random perturbations of at most @xmath106 away from the initial parameters , by means of an uniform distribution .",
    "each of the plots in figs . 1 , 2 , 3 represents the normalized density of points belonging to the data set , as a function of the values of a pair of observables .",
    "our parameter space point , given in eqs .",
    "( [ numl ] , [ numl ] ) , is also depicted in the figures as the intersection of the dashed horizontal line with the dashed vertical line .",
    "a salient feature illustrated by this numerical analysis is an interesting correlation between the values of @xmath1 and @xmath107 . in the region where values of @xmath1  are obtained in agreement with the daya - bay experiment , values of @xmath108  are favoured around @xmath109 .",
    "we have presented a unified view of the flavour structure of the quark and lepton sectors , based on the principle of universal democracy coming from a @xmath10 symmetry , where in leading order all fermion mass matrices are proportional to the democratic matrix . in the quark sector , small mixing arises from the breaking of ud which also generates the masses of the light generations . in the lepton sector",
    ", the breaking of ud is also small , but in the presence of the seesaw mechanism , this small breaking of ud is able to generate large leptonic mixing , including a value of @xmath1  in agreement with the daya - bay result .",
    "the smallness of the breaking of @xmath10 is natural in the thooft sense , since in the limit of exact ud , the lagrangean acquires the @xmath10 symmetry .    in conclusion",
    ", our analysis shows that the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing , both in the quark and lepton sectors , may reflect the principle of universal democracy , rendered natural by a @xmath10 symmetry .",
