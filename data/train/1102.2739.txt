    "object recognition systems have been broadly discussed in numerous studies from various fields . originated from vision research , visual object recognition systems are now subjects for interdisciplinary studies . at present , this is the field , where artificial intelligence ( ai ) meets neuroscience .",
    "one of the strongest recent trends is to create the systems , which exhibit biologically plausible performance .",
    "this purpose is achieved by tuning the parameters of the systems to the neurophysiological data . on the other hand , their architectures",
    "replicate the structure of the corresponding cortical systems .    according to neurophysiological findings ,",
    "the ventral visual stream ( vvs ) is the brain system responsible for visual object recognition .",
    "the vvs includes the v1 area ( primary visual cortex ) , the v2 , v3 and v4 areas and the it area ( inferior temporal cortex ) .",
    "the vvs has a hierarchical bottom - up structure of visual areas . along the vvs in the anterior direction starting from the primary visual cortex ,",
    "the size of receptive fields ( rfs ) of neurons increase .",
    "simultaneously , the selectivity of neurons decreases , i.e. , if the v1 neurons are strictly tuned to a bar of a single orientation and of a particular size , the v4 neurons are tuned to various geometric forms and exhibit higher degree of translation and scale invariance .",
    "consequently , a complexity and a size of visual features , recognized in the consecutive areas along the ventral stream , increase .",
    "therefore , most visual object recognition systems , born of a symbiosis of ai and neuroscience , have the functional architecture that resembles the hierarchical structure of the vvs .",
    "although not all the visual areas of real vvs are employed by the models , usually v1 and it areas are used .",
    "the area in - between is usually either v2 @xcite or v4 @xcite",
    ".    results of neurophysiological studies indicate that recognition task in the vvs is performed extremely fast .",
    "the processing time varies from 100 - 150ms for humans @xcite , and it is even shorter for monkeys @xcite .",
    "the extremely short processing time implies that no feedback ( top - down ) interaction occurs during visual processing .",
    "therefore many researchers attempted to model the feature of high speed processing by implementing only feed - forward connections @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rapid processing implies that a single neuron at each level fires only once , producing a _ _ single spike__@xcite(p .",
    "716 ) .    on the other hand , the bottom - up ( feed - forward ) and top - down ( feedback ) processing circuits can be found throughout the cortex .",
    "therefore , application of only feed - forward processing is a great simplification .",
    "the reciprocal information processing in the brain has been efficiently used in the concept of _ predictive coding _ , which has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "most recently , a hierarchical network with reciprocal ( bottom - up and top - down ) connections has been presented @xcite .",
    "this model employes propagation of waves of spikes and uses reciprocal connections to implement predictive coding .",
    "although , numerous models of the vvs have been presented , the matter of development of visual areas in vvs was not broadly discussed .",
    "several studies have addressed the matter of development of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex v1 @xcite , modular structures @xcite and inter - cortical development @xcite .",
    "the key mechanism of structure formation in developmental models is hebbian learning @xcite , while growth is implemented by growing self - organizing maps@xcite .",
    "we consider _ development _ on the scale of the vvs as extraction of new visual features in the v4 area and new objects in it .",
    "this is implemented by means of growing self - organizing networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , growing structure is not the only feature of the development",
    ". we also consider development to reflect the emergence of new connections between v4 and it due to inclusion of the new instances ( features in v4 and objects in it ) .",
    "therefore , development is regarded as a process of growing and establishing new connections of both intra- and inter - level types . in other words",
    ", development is the emergence of new neurons and new connections within and between hierarchical levels .",
    "the origin of development is based on extraction of new visual features across all hierarchical levels .    in this study",
    ", we introduce the framework to model developmental processes in the cortex - like visual object recognition system .",
    "this framework consists of three processing levels ( modules ) .",
    "these levels correspond to the v1 , v4 , and it areas of the vvs .",
    "the v4 and it levels can be also segregated into layers . both v4 and it levels have layers of growing som and radial basis function ( rbf ) units . meanwhile , the v4 level also has integrating layer .",
    "each layer is a single neural network .",
    "the schematic representation of the entire system , including the connections between the levels ( cortical areas ) and layers ( networks inside the cortical areas ) , is presented in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .",
    "the v1 level contains four distinct groups of neurons ( filter maps ) , which are mutually interconnected with inhibitory connection ( round - head solid lines ) .",
    "after inhibition the information from all four maps is integrated by the layer of the v4 level .",
    "the output of this layer is _ integrated orientation map ( iom)_. the iom is then sent to the v4 growing som layers by means of excitatory connections .",
    "the excitatory connections are indicated by arrow - head solid lines throughout the schema .",
    "after iom is translated into the feature map , it is sent v4 rbf units layer and to the it growing som layer .",
    "the it rbf units layer receives excitatory inputs from the it growing som layer as well .",
    "the it rbf units layer sends modulatory ( amplification of existing activation level ) signals ( marked with diamond - head dashed lines ) back to the v4 rbf units layer .",
    "the feedback modulated ( amplified ) signal from the v4 rbf units layer to it rbf unit layer is marked with arrow - head double solid line .",
    "the v4 and it growing som layers serve as repositories of visual features and objects , respectively . during the development the collection of visual features is changing . to update objects with valid features , interaction between the v4 and it growing som layers emerges .",
    "this is indicated by double - end arrow - head dashed line .",
    "the details of processing in each module , intra- and inter- layer and level intractions are discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "for the purpose of simulation we use ten stimuli ( objects ) presented in fig .",
    "the stimuli are @xmath0 pixel pictures of hands and cup .",
    "we use 11 black and white color gradations from 0 ( black ) to 1 ( white ) with step 0.1 on the normalized scale throughout the processing .          in this study , we employ gabor filters , as described by eq .",

    "is processed with gabor filters of four different orientations ( 0@xmath7 , 45@xmath7 , 90@xmath7 , and 135@xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore in the v1 area there are four distinct groups of neurons with different orientations .",
    "the rfs of these cells ` densely cover ' the entire retinal image .",
    "performance of each group is implemented as convolution of the gabor filter kernel with the retinal image .",
    "the result of convolution is an orientation map .",
    "each orientation map contains the response of the neurons selective for the same orientation , but situated at different locations . to identify a particular orientation at each location",

    "our assumption of several types of neurons is supported by the recently proposed models @xcite .",
    "type i neurons integrate information from different orientation maps ( @xmath11 ) , resulting from mutual inhibition .",
    "the iom ( output of the @xmath11 neurons ) is then processed to extract complex visual features as combinations of different orientations .",
    "to do so , the gsom @xcite is used .",
    "the neurons in gsom are the v4 type ii neurons ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the v4 neurons of type iii are rbf - units @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a tuning parameter , @xmath15 is the center of the rbf unit ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the current input of the rbf - unit .",
    "a prototype is a visual feature ( preferred stimulus ) of a certain @xmath18 neuron .    in terms of gaussian rbf , parameter @xmath14 is the inverted doubled variance : @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , variance @xmath20 of the gaussian function is usually chosen as some fraction of the distance from the origin to the object in the feature space @xcite .",
    "such distance can be calculated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a particular orienation at a given location of a visual feature , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are vertical and horizontal dimensions of the iom , respectively .",

    "the @xmath20 is then taken to be one tenth of the @xmath26 .    in our model ,",
    "the rf size of @xmath12 is @xmath27 matrix ( rf - matrix ) of the iom elements . concatenating the strings of the rf - matrix ,",

    "we do not use any updates for synaptic weight vectors , but only record the inputs that are sufficiently far from each other ( in terms of euclidean distance between the 9-dim synaptic vectors : if the distance between the input and @xmath12 neuron is greater than @xmath29 , input is considered to be distant enough ) .",
    "each @xmath12 neuron plays a role of rbf - center ( a prototype ) for @xmath18 .",

    "universal features_.    there are many aspects for the further extension of the system : 1 ) the classification ability of the neurons in the inferior temporal cortex @xcite ; 2 ) emergence of modular units like columnar structures @xcite ; 3 ) continuous topological structure of object representation @xcite etc .",
    "one of the possible further extension beyond the visual domain is to make this framework capable of operating with multimodal signals and perform cross - modal integration .",
    "moreover , the modular structure of the system implies the flexibility of the system s architecture .",
    "therefore , this framework can be used as a basis to test various biologically plausible configurations .",
    "for example , it is possible to extend the system with v2 and/or v3 areas without restrictions .",
    "furthermore , the capability of predictive coding makes this framework to be applicable and extendable to model dorsal visual stream for motion recognition , superior temporal sulcus for biological motion recognition etc .",
    "moreover , this framework has a potential serve as a platform to model large - scale cortical networks like mirror neuron system .",

    "<S> this study is focused on the development of the cortex - like visual object recognition system . </S>",

    "<S> these modules functionally correspond to the v1 , v4 and it areas . </S>",
    "<S> both bottom - up and top - down connections between the hierarchical levels v4 and it are employed . the higher the degree of matching between the input and the preferred stimulus , the shorter the response time of the neuron . </S>",
    "<S> therefore information about a single stimulus is distributed in time and is transmitted by the waves of spikes . </S>",
    "<S> the reciprocal connections and waves of spikes implement predictive coding : an initial hypothesis is generated on the basis of information delivered by the first wave of spikes and is tested with the information carried by the consecutive waves . </S>",
    "<S> the development is considered as extraction and accumulation of features in v4 and objects in it . once stored </S>",
