    "the radio arc near the galactic center ( gc ) ( @xmath530 pc in projection from the dynamical center of the galaxy , sgr a@xmath6 ) is considered to be one of the most unusual collections of sources in the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "both thermal and non - thermal sources comprise the radio arc .",
    "the most prominent sources are two sets of curved thermal filaments @xmath7 the arched filaments ( g0.10 + 0.08 ) and the sickle ( g0.18@xmath70.04 )  @xcite .",
    "these sources are all assumed to be at or very near the gc , which has a distance of 8.0 kpc ; thus 1  @xmath50.04 pc ( reid 1993 ) .",
    "one of the most exciting observational results of the last decade has been the near - infrared ( near - ir ) discovery of two extraordinary stellar clusters in the radio arc region , known as the quintuplet and arches clusters @xcite .",
    "these clusters have drastically changed our understanding of the stellar content in a region where the visual obscuration is 20@xmath730 magnitudes .",
    "the quintuplet cluster contains at least 10 wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , and more than a dozen luminous `` ob supergiants '' @xcite .",
    "the unusual pistol star ( luminosity of @xmath510@xmath8 l@xmath2 ) is thought to be a member of the quintuplet cluster @xcite .",
    "this star has been classified ( along with one other quintuplet member , # 362 ) as a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star  @xcite .",
    "this type of evolved o - star ( age @xmath5 4 myr ) is thought to be undergoing short lived mass - loss during which up to several m@xmath2  of material are ejected from its surface .",
    "the arches cluster appears to be an even more extraordinary cluster with @xmath535 wr stars as well as close to 100 luminous , evolved ob stars , making it one of the most densely - packed clusters in the galaxy @xcite . in total ,",
    "nearly 50 stars have been classified as wr stellar types in the radio arc region @xcite .",
    "such massive clusters are known to have a major impact on the interstellar medium .",
    "figure 1 shows the locations of these two clusters relative to the main features in the radio arc .",
    "the quintuplet and arches clusters are responsible for the ionization of the sickle and the arched filaments h2 regions @xcite .",
    "these luminous clusters with n@xmath9 @xmath510@xmath10 photons s@xmath3 ( quintuplet ) and @xmath54 @xmath0 10@xmath11 photons s@xmath3 ( arches ) can easily account for the average photon fluxes required from 8.5 ghz radio continuum observations ( 3 - 30 @xmath010@xmath12 photons s@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "radio emission from the individual stellar winds of such massive stars should be detectable at centimeter wavelengths based on the predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , high - resolution radio images made with the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) have revealed a number of compact radio sources in these two clusters @xcite . based on their spectral characteristics and positional associations with near - ir stellar sources ,",
    "the radio sources are interpreted to be stellar wind emission in both clusters .",
    "the radio flux densities indicate that many of the sources have high mass - loss rates ( m  @xmath13 2 @xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "the initial results of the quintuplet cluster radio sources presented by @xcite were based on low - resolution ( 2 - 10 ) archival vla data centered on the sickle h2 region and therefore were not ideal for detections of compact sources with sizes @xmath141 . here",
    "we present new , high resolution ( 0.3 - 3 ) vla images at 4.9 , 8.5 , 22.5 and 43.4 ghz of the quintuplet and arches stellar clusters that reveal new and variable radio sources and provide more accurate determination of the spectral indices and source sizes . although lang et al .",
    "( 2001b ) presented the first sub - arcsecond imaging of the arches cluster , here we provide a second epoch image at 8.5 ghz to search for new and variable radio sources in this cluster and an image of the cluster at 22.5 ghz to better characterize the spectral indices and sizes of the sources .",
    "the observations and data reduction are presented in @xmath152 , the results in @xmath153 , and the interpretation and discussion follow in @xmath154 .",
    "vla multifrequency observations were made during 1999@xmath72004 of the quintuplet cluster , pistol star , and the arches cluster using the a , bna , b , d and dnc array configurations .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observational details . at 4.9 and 8.5",
    "ghz , j1331 + 305 and j1751 - 253 were used as flux and phase calibrators .",
    "standard procedures for calibration , editing and imaging were carried out using the astronomy image processing software ( aips ) of the nrao . at the higher frequencies ( 22.5 and 43.4 ghz ) ,",
    "the observations were carried out differently . in the bna and b array at both 22.5 and 43.4 ghz ,",
    "the atmospheric phase fluctuations can be very pronounced , so that a fast cycle time between source and phase calibrator ( sgr a@xmath6 ) was used , with a total cycle time of 2 minutes ( 90 seconds on source , 30 seconds on calibrator ) .",
    "the pointing was checked every hour using 8.5 ghz observations of 1751 - 253 . in the dnc and d arrays at 22.5 and 43.4",
    "ghz , a total cycle time of 5 minutes was employed ( 260 seconds on source , 40 seconds on calibrator ) .",
    "pointing was also checked every hour by using 8.5 ghz observations of j1751 - 253 .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was determined from the observations of j1331 + 305 , with an assumed flux density of 2.52 jy at 22.5 ghz and 1.45 jy at 43.4 ghz and is used to measure a flux density of 1.3 jy at 22.5 ghz and 1.4 jy at 43.4 ghz for sgr a@xmath6 .",
    "as the primary beam at 43.4 ghz is only 1 , the 43.4 ghz observations were centered on the extended sources qr1 - 3 ( see figure 2 ) rather than the center of the quintuplet cluster since one of the goals of this study was to determine the flux densities of these unusual sources .",
    "all images were created in aips using the standard imaging program imagr .",
    "table 2 summarizes the final image resolutions and rms noise levels .",
    "the images shown in figures 2 - 6 have not been corrected for primary beam attenuation , but flux densities were measured in images that had been corrected for this attenuation . because the primary beams at 4.9 and 8.5 ghz are very large ( 9  and 5.4 , respectively ) , and because the quintuplet and arches clusters are located near two very extended h2 regions ( see figure 1 ) , it is necessary to filter out part of the extended emission in the images",
    ". it is possible to do this with a radio interferometer by removing out the shortest _ ( u , v ) _ baselines in the _ ( u , v ) _ data , which correspond to the largest sized structures in the resulting image . table 2 lists the cutoffs made to the data in the _ ( u , v ) _ plane ( in kilo - wavelengths ) and the corresponding size scales ( in arcseconds ) above which the flux is subsequently filtered out ( i.e. , the largest angular size scale present ) .",
    "in addition , at 22.5 ghz , two images of the quintuplet cluster were produced : ( a ) a `` high '' resolution ( @xmath140.5 ) image using _ only _ the b and bna array data to investigate the most compact sources , and ( b ) a `` low '' resolution ( @xmath51.5 ) image using all the available data to investigate the more extended sources .",
    "figure 2 shows the 8.5 ghz image of the radio sources within approximately 25  ( @xmath51 pc ) of the quintuplet cluster center . the pistol nebula is a prominent extended radio source in this image and the near - ir position of the pistol is represented by a cross .",
    "the pistol nebula is believed to be the ejecta from a previous mass - loss event of the pistol star , but also partly ionized by the quintuplet cluster stars @xcite .",
    "nine compact radio sources are detected and we refer to them as qr1 - 9 .",
    "qr1 - 5 were previously identified by @xcite .",
    "qr6 - 9 are newly identified in this image .",
    "the radio sources were identified based on their signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath135 in most cases ) .",
    "the source qr9 has s / n @xmath53 and is located outside of figure 2 , but was identified based on its positional association with a near - ir source ( see @xmath153.1.2 below for more details on near - ir counterparts ) .",
    "flux densities at all four frequencies ( 4.9 , 8.5 , 22.5 and 43.4 ghz ) for qr1 - 9 and the pistol star were measured in primary beam corrected images and are listed in table 3 .",
    "the aips fitting routine jmfit was used to measure the flux densities and deconvolved sizes for qr4 - 9 .",
    "the background levels in the area where qr1 - 3 are located ( to the north of the quintuplet cluster center ; see figure 2 ) vary strongly because of the proximity to the radio arc nonthermal linear filaments .",
    "in addition , the sources qr1 - 3 have lower surface brightnesses ( @xmath50.2 mjy beam@xmath3  at 8.5 ghz ) than the more compact sources qr5 - 8 ( average value of @xmath50.6 mjy beam@xmath3  at 8.5 ghz ) , which makes the flux densities more difficult to calculate . in order to estimate accurate flux densities for these sources , the flux densities of several representative background regions",
    "were measured using the viewer tool in the _ aips++ _ software package ( http://aips2.nrao.edu ) .",
    "this tool was also used to integrate over the region of each source at all four frequencies simultaneously .",
    "the source flux densities were then corrected for the background levels at each frequency to determine the final flux densities listed in table 3 .",
    "several sources were not detected at the higher frequencies . at 22.5 ghz , the source qr7 is not detected , most likely because of confusion in the vicinity of the pistol nebula .",
    "secondly , the source qr9 lies at the edge of the primary beam at 22.5 ghz , and attenuation likely prevents a detection . at 43.4 ghz , detections of sources qr4 - 8",
    "were not made , probably due to the low resolution of the beam at this frequency ( @xmath52 ) , the fact that these sources are fairly compact ( @xmath161 ) , and the larger rms level in this image ( @xmath5100 @xmath17jy beam@xmath3 ) .",
    "qr9 is not detected at 43.4 ghz as it lies outside of the 1  primary beam .",
    "spectral indices , @xmath18 , are calculated for all sources and are compiled in table 4 .",
    "upper limits for flux densities at 4.9 ghz can be estimated for several of the sources not detected at this frequency , with resulting lower limits for the 4.9 to 8.5 ghz and 4.9 to 22.5 ghz spectral indices . qr1 - 3 and the pistol star show spectral indices consistent with being flat ( @xmath18@xmath5@xmath70.3 to @xmath70.1 with average errors of @xmath190.4 ) .",
    "qr4 - 9 show rising spectral indices in the range of @xmath18 = + 0.4 to + 2.0 , also with large errors ( @xmath190.2 to 0.8 ) .",
    "several sources exhibit complex structure , which makes determination of the spectral index difficult .",
    "figure 2 ( 8.5 ghz image ) and figure 3 ( the `` high '' resolution 22.5 ghz image ) show that qr5 is a compact source .",
    "however , in the `` low '' resolution image at 22.5 ghz and in the 43.4 ghz image , this source has a compact center , but appears to have associated extended emission .",
    "therefore , spectral indices are calculated for qr5 by comparing the flux densities in images where the source structure is similar ( i.e. , comparing the 8.5 ghz with the 22.5 ghz `` high '' resolution image and the 22.5 ghz `` low '' resolution image with the 43.4 ghz image ) .",
    "qr7 is compact at 4.9 ghz , but fairly extended at 8.5 ghz and thus the spectral index is difficult to measure , but appears to be positive .",
    "qr9 is not detected 4.9 ghz and is detected only with a signal to noise ratio of 3.5 in the 8.5 ghz observations .",
    "we therefore estimate a lower limit for its spectral index of @xmath18 @xmath13 + 0.2 , implying that this source is likely to have a positive spectral index .",
    "the majority of the quintuplet radio sources are resolved and the deconvolved sizes and corresponding linear sizes are presented in table 3 .",
    "the deconvolved sizes were derived from the 8.5 ghz image ( figure 2 ) , although the sizes of qr5 - 9 were also measured in the `` high '' resolution image at 22.5 ghz where detected .",
    "the major axis sizes range from 0.3  ( 0.015 pc ) to 4.0  ( 0.17 pc ) .",
    "three sources ( qr6 , qr8 , and qr9 ) are unresolved at both 8.5 and 22.5 ghz . for comparison ,",
    "figure 3 shows that qr5 is resolved and qr6 is unresolved in the 22.5 ghz `` high '' resolution image .",
    "sources qr1 - 3 are more extended than the other sources in the quintuplet cluster ; their sizes range from 1.5  ( 0.06 pc ) to 4  ( 0.16 pc ) .",
    "figure 4 shows a detailed image of the sources qr1 - 3 at 8.5 , 22.5 and 43.4 ghz .",
    "the crosses in figure 2 represent the positions of near - ir stars in the quintuplet cluster from @xcite with spectral classifications ( representing only a fraction of the total number of luminous stars in the cluster ) .",
    "the positions of 28 stars are shown in figure 2 ( crosses ) and represents the central region of the cluster .",
    "there is a systematic shift of positions between the near - ir and radio images ( @xmath20ra=0.9 ) , which is consistent with previous comparisons between _",
    "hst_/nicmos images of the gc clusters and radio data @xcite .",
    "all radio sources in the quintuplet cluster appear to have near - ir counterparts within the positional uncertainty of 1 , except for qr1 - 3 ( discussed later in @xmath154.1.3 ) .",
    "table 4 gives the stellar counterparts from figer et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "the near - ir counterparts to qr4 , qr5 , and the pistol star were known from the results of lang et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , but the near - ir counterparts of qr6 - 9 are newly associated .",
    "the exact spectral classifications of these stars are not well known , although @xcite provide some rough classifications in their table 3 .",
    "all the near - ir counterparts to the radio sources in our study appear to be evolving massive stars ( @xmath5 few myr ) , with many classified as wr stellar types ( figer et al .",
    "1999a , b ; cotera et al .",
    "in particular , the near - ir counterpart of qr7 is one of five stars in the quintuplet whose nature is unclear because the near - ir spectra are essentially featureless .",
    "@xcite suggest that these five stars should be categorized as dusty , wc late - type stars ( dwcl ) , which are the coolest carbon - rich wr stars that tend to form circumstellar dust shells",
    ". however , moneti et al . (",
    "2001 ) present mid - infrared spectroscopic observations of these stars , but find no evidence ( i.e. , circumstellar absorption lines ) to support the dwcl hypothesis .",
    "the near - ir counterpart of qr9 is also noteworthy as it has been classified as the second lbv star in the quintuplet ( # 362 ) besides the pistol star @xcite .      the radio source associated with",
    "the pistol star is a prominent extended source located @xmath510  ( 0.4 pc ) to the south of the pistol nebula .",
    "a separate observation pointed in the direction of the pistol star was made in 1999 in order to study the radio emission associated with this extraordinary star .",
    "figure 5 shows that the radio source has a bipolar morphology , and that the pistol star lies at the center of this source .",
    "the extended emission has a size of approximately 4  ( 0.16 pc ) in the n - s direction and approximately 2  ( 0.08 pc ) in the e - w direction .",
    "the flux densities for the pistol radio source are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the spectral index of the radio emission is essentially flat ( @xmath21=0.0@xmath190.4 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the 8.5 ghz image of the arches cluster .",
    "nine radio sources with signal - to - noise greater than three are present in the images and are labelled as ar1 - 9 .",
    "ar10 is detected with a signal to noise ratio of only two , but is coincident with a near - ir counterpart .",
    "sources ar1 - 8 were previously identified by @xcite , and ar9 and 10 are newly detected .",
    "five of these sources are also detected at 22.5 ghz .",
    "the flux densities at 8.5 and 22.5 ghz were measured for ar1 - 10 using the aips task jmfit and are listed in table 5 .",
    "the 8.5 ghz observation presented here is a second epoch observation of this cluster and several sources showed moderate variability compared with the observations of @xcite : ar1 , ar3 , ar4 and ar8 varied by 12% , 29% , 30% , and 25% , respectively .",
    "the 22.5 to 8.5 ghz spectral index is calculated and also listed in table 5 .",
    "all of the sources except for ar6 show rising spectral indices .",
    "ar1 is the only source that is resolved at 8.5 ghz , and has a deconvolved size of 0.14@xmath00.10  ( 0.006@xmath00.004 pc ) . at 22.5 ghz ,",
    "ar1 is partially resolved with a deconvolved size of 0.12  ( 0.005 pc ) along its major axis .",
    "although the 4.9 to 8.5 ghz spectral index for ar1 is rising ( @xmath18=+0.35@xmath190.04 ; lang et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , the flux density of this source at 22.5 ghz is less than at 8.5 ghz .",
    "it is also possible that some of this extended emission may be missing from the image of ar1 at 22.5 ghz as the largest angular size detected in the bna array configuration of the vla at 22.5 ghz could be as small as 2 .",
    "for this reason , the 22.5 to 8.5 ghz spectral index is not calculated for ar1 .",
    "the crosses in figure 6 represent the positions of near - ir stars in the arches cluster from @xcite .",
    "eight of these stars had been previously detected by @xcite and @xcite and classified with emission - line features .",
    "the recent observations of @xcite confirm that at least thirty of the stars in the arches cluster have the spectral features characteristic of young , massive stars , including all ten of the near - ir counterparts to the ar1 - 10 radio sources .",
    "similar to the quintuplet , there is a systematic shift ( @xmath20ra=0.8 , @xmath20dec=0.5 ) between the near - ir and radio sources in the arches cluster .",
    "however , this shift is within 1 , which is typical given the astrometric uncertainty of _ hst_. the position of ar6 is found to be coincident with that of an emission line star ( f19 ) .",
    "there is also a weak radio source ( ar10 ; 2@xmath22 detection ) associated with the near - ir source to the w of ar6 and its near - ir counterpart .",
    "sources qr6 , qr8 , and qr9 show the major properties of stellar wind emission : ( 1 ) they have rising spectral indices in the range of + 0.5 to + 1.0 , ( 2 ) they are unresolved sources at the resolutions observed , which means their physical sizes are @xmath14 0.2  ( 0.009 pc ) at 22.5 ghz and @xmath140.5  ( 0.02 pc ) at 8.5 ghz , and ( 3 ) they are coincident positionally with young , massive stars .",
    "therefore , these three radio sources are interpreted to be stellar winds from quintuplet cluster stars .",
    "the flux densities of radio detections of stellar winds can be used to calculate mass loss rates ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "based on panagia & felli ( 1975 ) and wright & barlow ( 1975 ) , the mass loss rate can be estimated for an isotropic , homogeneous wind with constant velocity , electron density and chemical composition .",
    "however , 20 - 25% of early - type stars are known to have a nonthermal ( and variable ) component in their winds ( abbott et al .",
    "1984 ; bieging et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the typical spectral index of such sources is in the range of @xmath18@xmath5@xmath70.6 to + 0.3 for frequencies between 5 and 43 ghz ( beiging et al .",
    "1989 ; contreras et al . 1996 ) .",
    "contamination of the flux density by the nonthermal component can occur at the lower frequencies .",
    "therefore , higher frequency observations ( i.e. , 23 ghz compared to 5 ghz ) may be a better tracer of the thermal component and give more reliable mass - loss rates ( contreras et al .",
    "1996 ) . the mass - loss rate can be estimated from our 22.5 ghz observations using :    @xmath24    where s@xmath25 is the flux density of the source at 22.5 ghz , v@xmath26  is the terminal velocity of the wind ( assumed to be 1000 km s@xmath3 ; cotera et al .",
    "1996 ; nagata et al .",
    "1995 ) , and d is the distance to the source ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "we have assumed an electron temperature of 10@xmath27 k , z=1 , and a mean molecular weight , @xmath17=2 , due to the enrichment in heavy elements of the late - type wn stars ( leitherer et al .",
    "1997 ) , a classification which figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and figer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) has assigned to most of the quintuplet and arches cluster stars .",
    "leitherer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that there is very little variation in the mass - loss rates for wr stars , with an average value of @xmath54 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 .",
    "cappa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) recently carried out a survey of galactic wr stars and came to similar conclusions concerning the measured radio mass - loss rates ; the average values from their study were 2 - 4 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 .",
    "values for the mass - loss rates of qr6 , qr8 and qr9 range from 3.2@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3  to 4.3@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3   ( see table 4 ) .",
    "these values agree well with those found for wr stars described above as well as for other young , massive stellar types .",
    "the nature of radio emission from sources qr4 , qr5 and qr7 is less clear than that from qr6 , qr8 and qr9 .",
    "although qr4 , qr5 and qr7 show rising spectra and are coincident with near - ir sources , their sizes are more extended ( @xmath131  at 8.5 ghz ) than expected for stellar wind sources . according to rodriguez et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , the angular size of a stellar wind can be related directly to its flux density , independent of mass - loss rate and terminal wind velocity . for the 8.5 ghz flux densities of qr4 ,",
    "qr5 and qr7 , the expected angular size of the corresponding stellar wind should be @xmath140.05 .",
    "the actual sizes of the sources ( 0.3  to 4 ) are clearly larger than the predicted value . however , as mentioned previously ( in @xmath152.2 ) , the quintuplet radio sources are located amidst a very complicated set of extended features , which includes the sickle and pistol h2 regions as well as the linear , nonthermal filaments of the radio arc .",
    "although filtering in the _ ( u , v ) _ plane can help by removing the extended structures , the quintuplet sources may still be contaminated by residual background emission , which can make determination of flux densities and sizes difficult .",
    "although the errors in size determination are substantial ( 0.3@xmath70.5 ; 20 - 50% ) , the sizes are still much more extended than the predicted values for stellar winds ( e.g. , @xmath140.05 ) .",
    "mass - loss rates are calculated for these sources as described above , and the values for qr4 , qr5 and qr7 ( average m  of 1.2 @xmath0 10@xmath28 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 ) are significantly larger than for the stellar wind sources qr6 , qr8 and qr9 ( average m  of 3.7@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "while values for m  of @xmath5 10@xmath28 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3  are not unexpected for some mass - losing stars , they typically correspond to epochs when the star may be experiencing an enhanced rate of mass - loss from its surface ( i.e. , the lbv phase ; white et al . 1994 ) .    therefore , the simple interpretation of stellar wind emission may not apply for qr4 , qr5 and qr7 .",
    "however , the rising spectra and extended sizes of these sources are consistent with partially - thick free - free emission associated with an inhomogeneous , but spatially unresolved , h2 region .",
    "therefore , qr4 , qr5 and qr7 could be inhomogeneous h2 regions or even combinations of stellar wind emission and optically - thin , free - free emission from associated ionized material ( perhaps leftover from the formation of the stars ) . based on mezger & henderson ( 1967 ) , we can estimate the physical properties of these regions of ionized gas , assuming they have become optically - thin at the highest frequency at which they are detected , using the deconvolved sizes of these sources , and using an electron temperature of 10@xmath27 k. table 4 lists the electron density , n@xmath29 , mass of ionized hydrogen , m@xmath30 , emission measure , em , and the production rate of ionizing photons , n@xmath9 for these sources .",
    "the values of these h2 properties for qr4 , qr5 and qr7 ( in addition to their linear sizes of 0.03 - 0.05 pc ) are consistent with those for compact and ultra - compact h2 regions ( wood & churchwell 1990 )",
    ".      the properties of qr1 - 3 differ from the other radio sources in the quintuplet .",
    "as described in @xmath153.1.1 , qr1 - 3 are more spatially extended than qr6 , qr8 and qr9 by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "more significantly , qr1 - 3 are the only radio sources in the two clusters without closely associated near - ir counterparts . these sources also define the northern edge of the quintuplet cluster ( 5 - 10  north of qr4 - 7 and the main concentration of stellar members ) .",
    "table 4 shows that the spectral indices are close to flat with large errors ( i.e. @xmath18=@xmath70.3@xmath190.2 for @xmath21 for qr1 ) .",
    "such spectra can be attributed to optically thin , free - free emission associated with h2 regions .",
    "since there are no stellar counterparts to qr1 - 3 , a likely explanation for these sources is that they may represent embedded massive stellar sources ( churchwell 1990 ) .",
    "the linear sizes of qr1 - 3 of @xmath50.1 pc are consistent with the upper end of the size distribution of ultra - compact h2 regions in the sample of kurtz , churchwell , & wood ( 1994 ) . as only @xmath31% of ultra - compact h2 regions are detectable at near - ir wavelengths ( hanson , luhman , & rieke 2002 ) , the lack of near - ir emission associated with qr1 - 3 is also consistent with their being ultra - compact h2 regions .",
    "as described above , the h2 properties for qr1 - 3 are derived from the radio continuum and listed in table 4 .",
    "the production rate of ionizing photons , n@xmath9 , can provide an estimate of the embedded stellar type that is responsible for the associated radio emission ( assuming a single ionizing star ) .",
    "values for n@xmath9 range from @xmath32  s@xmath3 .",
    "these ionizing fluxes are consistent with embedded b - type massive stars ( @xmath5 b1v - b2v ; @xcite ) .",

    "these studies conclude that typically @xmath33% of the ionizing flux from the embedded stars in uc h2s escapes to the outer envelope .",
    "thus , the inferred stellar content from the @xmath34 values determined for sources qr1 - 3 may be an underestimate , in which case they could have spectral types earlier than b. therefore , we tentatively identify qr1 - 3 as ultracompact or compact h2 regions .    the proximity of the quintuplet cluster radio sources ( and in particular , sources qr1 - 3 ) to the edge of a molecular cloud identified by serabyn & gsten ( 1991 ) may indicate that these sources are physically associated with this molecular cloud . in the cs ( j=3 - 2 ) image of serabyn & gsten , a finger of emission extends toward the projected location of qr1 - 3 , indicating the presence of moderately dense gas . the apparent physical association between qr1 - 3 and",
    "the edge of the molecular cloud suggests that these young stellar objects have recently emerged from the molecular cloud , probably as a result of erosion due to the more evolved massive stars in the quintuplet cluster .",
    "indeed , the quintuplet cluster is thought to be the source of ionization for the larger sickle h2 region ( lang , goss & wood 1997 ; figer et al .",
    "1999a ) , which traces the inner edge of the molecular cloud .    alternatively , the radio sources which are not interpreted to be stellar winds ( qr1 - 3 , qr4 , qr5 , and qr7 ) may represent clumps of molecular material leftover from the formation of the stars in the cluster that are externally ionized by the quintuplet cluster members . assuming",
    "these clumps are located at approximately the projected distances from the center of the cluster , the quintuplet could easily account for their ionization as it is responsible for the ionization of the much larger sickle h2 region ( located 1  or 2.5 pc to the ne ) and the north side of the pistol nebula ( lang et al .",
    "1997 ; figer et al .",
    "if any of the quintuplet radio sources are confirmed to be compact or uc h2s , this detection will lead to the study of the earliest stages of stellar evolution in one of the most extreme environments in the milky way .",
    "in particular , these objects are located in a region of strong magnetic fields , high turbulent velocities , and extremely high metallicities ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows that the radio emission associated with the pistol star has a bipolar morphology centered around the position of the star and has a flat spectral index ( @xmath21 = + 0.1@xmath190.4 ) .",
    "one explanation for this source is that it represents the current mass - loss of the star .",
    "( the outer `` pistol - shaped '' nebula is thought to contain the mass associated with an episode of previous mass - loss ( @xmath5  11 m@xmath2 , @xmath55000 years ago ; figer et al .",
    "1998 ) ) . in this case",
    ", the integrated flux density would imply a mass - loss rate of 2.7@xmath010@xmath28  m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 .",
    "this value is much higher than the average value for wr stellar types ( see @xmath154.1.1 ) , but similarly high mass - loss rates have been detected in other lbv stars during epochs of extreme mass - loss ( e.g. , @xmath4 car ; white et al .",
    "1994 ) and in several wr colliding - wind binary systems ( contreras et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "however , as for sources qr4 , qr5 , and qr7 , the extended size of the pistol star radio emission is much larger than the expected angular size for a stellar wind source ( @xmath50.1 ) using the methods of rodrguez et al .",
    "another problem with the interpretation of the pistol as a stellar wind source is that its double - lobed radio emission is not well modelled by a spherically - symmetric stellar wind surrouding the star .",
    "it is possible to calculate a mass - loss rate for the source using the total mass and assuming an expansion velocity for the radio emission .",
    "assuming that the radio emission is optically - thin , free - free emission , with t@xmath29@xmath510@xmath27 k , and taking the deconvolved angular sizes of the lobes to be 1@xmath35 , we can estimate the total mass in the lobes to be @xmath5 0.02 @xmath36 .",
    "the separation between the pistol star and each of the lobes is @xmath37 cm . assuming that the lobes are expanding at a velocity of 1000 km s@xmath3 , we estimate a mass - loss rate of @xmath38 @xmath36 yr@xmath3 . this value is roughly consistent with the value obtained by using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "in addition , it is possible to calculate the ionizing flux required to maintain the bipolar radio source . at a distance of 8 kpc and",
    "with the integrated flux density measured , n@xmath9 has a value of @xmath39 s@xmath3 , which can be provided by an early b - type star .",
    "however , the two lobes that constitute the radio source are intersecting only a fraction of the 4@xmath40 radians around the star .",
    "furthermore , the ionized nebula may be density - bounded , with most of the ionizing flux of the pistol star escaping to the interstellar medium , so the star is likely to be of an earlier spectral type .",

    "in fact , a variety of types of nebular features are detected around other lbv stars and are thought to be the result of stellar wind emission interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium ( nota et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the cases of galactic sources hg car , ag car ,",

    "the bipolar morphology of such radio nebulae suggests that the mass - loss is not isotropic ( e.g. , @xmath4 car ) .",
    "this type of non - spherical wind emission has been explained by several different mechanisms : ( 1 ) _ internal _ processes , such as the stellar rotation of such massive stars and the resulting mass - loss geometry ( owocki & gayley 1997 ; maeder & maynet 2000 ; smith et al .",
    "2004 ) , and ( 2 ) _ external _ processes , such as the influence of a binary companion on the mass - loss geometry ( iben & livio 1993 ) or expansion of the nebula into a region of high density - contrast interstellar medium ( nota et al .",

    "however , moderate variability ( at the level of 12 - 30% ) is detected in several of the arches radio sources previously detected ( ar1 , ar3 , ar4 , ar8 ) and possibly explains the new detection of ar9 .",
    "the flux densities of two of the four sources decreased , while the flux density of the other two sources increased .",
    "therefore , we can rule out a systematic calibration problem . this moderate variability may indicate ( i ) the presence of a time - variable nonthermal component ( due to shocks in the wind , or colliding winds for a binary system ) and/or ( ii ) variability in the mass - loss rate or wind velocity ( contreras et al .",
