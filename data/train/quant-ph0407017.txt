    "let us consider the following task .",
    "alice has at her disposal a qubit @xmath1 in an _ unknown _ pure normalized state @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the eigenvectors of the pauli diagonal matrix @xmath20 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively ) and she would like to _ optimally _ partially teleport the state to bob . according to the definition in introduction optimal",
    "pqt means that after the teleportation alice and bob each hold an imperfect copy @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , of the original state whose fidelities @xmath5 and @xmath3 saturate the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "alice can perform the task via the teleportation scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for this purpose",
    "she needs four cnot gates , four hadamard gates , a pair of properly prepared auxiliary qubits and a shared entangled state .",
    "initially , alice and bob share a pair of qubits @xmath10 and @xmath2 prepared in a singlet state @xmath25 .",
    "the key ingredient of the protocol is the pnbm that is performed by alice .",
    "this is in fact the perfect non - demolition bell measurement @xcite on the qubits @xmath1 and @xmath10 in which the ancillary qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 are prepared in the state of the form @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for @xmath31 the state ( [ ancillas ] )",
    "is partially entangled .",
    "this follows from the fact that the purity @xmath32 of the reduced density matrix @xmath33 of the qubit @xmath26 is less than one for @xmath31 .",
    "further , since @xmath34 , where the equality holds for @xmath35 , @xmath36 for any @xmath37 and @xmath38 and therefore the state ( [ ancillas ] ) is never entangled maximally the largest amount of entanglement being achieved for @xmath35 .",
    "the logical network in the pnbm ( see dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) transforms the input state @xmath39 to @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the product of local unitary transformations on qubits @xmath10 and @xmath2 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are standard pauli matrices and the identity matrix , respectively , of the qubit @xmath50 .",
    "measuring the ancillary qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the basis @xmath18 , @xmath19 one finds with probability @xmath51 one of four results @xmath52 and @xmath53 where the first ( second ) digit is the result of the measurement on the qubit @xmath54 . communicating the result to bob via classical channel , performing the corresponding unitary transformations @xmath55 , @xmath56 on qubits @xmath10 and @xmath2 , and taking into account the formula @xmath57 we find that alice and bob in each run of the teleportation establish between themselves a normalized state of three qubits @xmath58 and @xmath2 of the form @xmath59 , i. e. the ancillary qubits are prepared in the separable state @xmath60 and therefore the pnbm does not discriminate among the bell states , the input state is completely preserved in the original qubit . if , on the other hand , @xmath61 , i. e. the ancillary qubits are prepared in the separable state @xmath62 therefore the pnbm perfectly discriminates among the bell states , the input state @xmath0 is completely teleported to bob . for @xmath63 , i. e. for partially entangled ancillary qubits when pnbm discriminates partially among the bell states , the state ( [ final ] ) represents a coherent superposition of two previous possibilities the probability amplitudes of which being controlled by the choice of the parameter @xmath37 in the state ( [ ancillas ] ) . in other words",
    ", this intermediate case corresponds to the _ partial _ teleportation of the qubit @xmath1 . in what follows",
    "we show that the quantum teleportation scheme is _ optimal _ in the sense of the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) .    tracing the state ( [ final ] ) over two qubits one finds the remaining qubit @xmath64 in the mixed state @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the state orthogonal to the input state @xmath67 and @xmath68 since the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) becomes equality for the latter fidelities our scheme really realizes an _ optimal _ pqt .",
    "viewed from the point of view of quantum cloning , our scheme realizes a measurement induced and entanglement assisted optimal @xmath69 universal asymmetric quantum cloning machine @xcite . in particular , if the superposition in the state ( [ ancillas ] ) is balanced with @xmath35 , then the information is distributed symmetrically between the qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the fidelities @xmath70 . in the language of quantum cloning",
    "this regime corresponds to an _ optimal _ symmetric universal quantum cloning @xcite .",
    "moreover , the third qubit @xmath10 leaves the teleportation in the state @xmath71 for which the fidelity @xmath72 attains its maximum possible value @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , our scheme also realizes deterministically the _ optimal _ universal not gate @xcite .",
    "it remains to prepare the state of ancillas @xmath74 .",
    "this can be done with the help of a single cnot gate and four local unitary transformations as is depicted in fig .",
    "the transformations @xmath75 and @xmath76 are represented in the basis @xmath18 , @xmath19 by the rotations @xmath75 and @xmath76 with elements @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the hadamard gate and @xmath80 is represented in the basis @xmath81 by the orthogonal matrix @xmath80 with elements @xmath82",
    "as it was already mentioned the standard bell measurement is a projection measurement on a system of two qubits @xmath1 and @xmath10 discriminating perfectly among four orthogonal bell states .",
    "consequently , the measurement provides maximum information on an unknown pure two - qubit state and therefore the mean fidelity of the estimated state is @xmath83 @xcite while disturbing the input state in such a way that it does not carry any more information on the state and therefore the mean fidelity of the output state is also @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the partial bell measurement considered in the preceding section discriminates among the bell states only partially thus providing less information on the input state of qubits @xmath1 and @xmath10 while preserving larger information in the outgoing qubits . as the degree of the bell state discrimination",
    "can be controlled by the parameter @xmath37 in the ancillary state ( [ ancillas ] ) , one can increase continuously the information gain at the expense of a larger disturbance of the measured system .    to express this behaviour quantitatively",
    "let us assume the ancillary qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be again prepared in the state ( [ ancillas ] ) .",
    "for such a state the measurement scheme in the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] realizes a two - qubit quantum operation on qubits @xmath1 and @xmath10 described by the set of four operators @xmath85 , @xmath86 where we have identified the indices @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the measurement outcomes @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the bell basis @xmath89 , @xmath90 the operators are represented by the diagonal matrices @xmath91 consequently , the pnbm preserves the bell states and therefore it really realizes a non - demolition measurement of these states .",
    "further , the operators ( [ povm ] ) satisfy the completeness relation @xmath92 due to the normalization condition @xmath29 and hence the pnbm performs partial discrimination of the bell states deterministically . restricting ourselves to pure two - qubit input states , the information gain in the pnbm can be characterized by the mean estimation fidelity @xmath14 while the disturbance of the state caused by the measurement can be characterized by the mean operation fidelity @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the fidelities can be calculated from the formulas @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath95 .",
    "on inserting the eqs .",
    "( [ povm ] ) into the formulas ( [ formula2 ] ) we finally arrive at the fidelities of the pnbm @xmath96 now an interesting question arises what is the trade - off between the obtained fidelities ( [ formula3 ] ) . substituting the fidelities ( [ formula3 ] ) into the inequality ( [ banaszek2 ] )",
    "one finds that they saturate the inequality .",
    "hence , the pnbm is an _",
    "optimal _ two - qubit quantum operation in the sense that for a given operation fidelity @xmath15 a larger estimation fidelity @xmath14 can not be obtained .",
    "therefore , the measurement allows an optimal pct of two - qubit states .",
    "moreover , as the same optimal distribution of information can be achieved in quantum teleportation with nonmaximally entangled states @xcite , our scheme represents a local counterpart to the quantum teleportation based on nonmaximally entangled states .",
    "let us now study the extension of the optimal pqt to continuous - variables ( cvs ) . in this case",
    "the five relevant qubits are replaced with the five modes of electromagnetic field described by the quadrature operators @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 with the commutators @xmath100=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "the state of the mode @xmath1 that is to be teleported is an _",
    "unknown _ coherent state @xmath101 . for cvs",
    "the optimal pqt means that after the teleportation alice and bob hold imperfect copies @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , of the original coherent state having the following fidelities @xmath102 , @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the asymmetry parameter @xcite .",
    "the cv extension of the qubit protocol presented in sec .  [ sec_qubits ] is as follows .",
    "initially , alice and bob share a two - mode squeezed vacuum state of modes @xmath10 and @xmath2 produced in the non - degenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "alice then performs the _ cv partial non - demolition bell measurement _ on the mode @xmath1 whose state is to be teleported and on the mode @xmath10 of the nopa state .",
    "recently , the measurement was used for partial reversion of the cv cloning @xcite . the measurement exploits two ancillary vacuum modes @xmath26 , @xmath27 and a sequence of four cv cnot gates followed by the homodyne detections of the @xmath108 quadrature on mode @xmath26 and @xmath109 quadrature on mode @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the cnot gates are realized by the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) interaction @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the control ( target ) mode and @xmath112 is the coupling constant . by the measurement alice detects the quadratures @xmath113 and @xmath114 for which she obtains two classical results @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the quadratures of mode @xmath1 transform as @xmath117 while the quadratures of the remaining two modes @xmath10 and @xmath2 can be written as @xmath118 as a result of alice s measurement the operators @xmath119 and @xmath120 collapse in modes @xmath10 and @xmath2 into the classical variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 . after the measurement alice and bob perform on the modes the displacements @xmath121 thus obtaining the following output quadratures : @xmath122 the fidelities @xmath5 and @xmath3 between the input coherent state and the output states @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be calculated from the formula @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the mean number of chaotic photons in @xmath64th mode .",
    "hence , one finally arrives using the eqs .",
    "( [ ca ] ) and ( [ output ] ) at the following formulas : @xmath125 where @xmath126 . comparing the obtained fidelities with those of given in eq .",
    "( [ asymf ] ) , we find that while the operation fidelity @xmath5 attains optimal value the teleportation fidelity @xmath3 is reduced in comparison with the optimal value ( [ asymf ] ) due to the finiteness of the shared entanglement .",
    "therefore , in contrast with the qubit protocol our cv teleportation scheme realizes only approximately optimal pqt of coherent states .",
    "the teleportation fidelity @xmath3 can approach the optimum ( [ asymf ] ) arbitrarily closely if sufficiently large cv entanglement ( sufficiently large squeezing @xmath107 ) is available .",
    "in conclusion , we have explicitly constructed a joint two - qubit non - demolition measurement allowing to partially deterministically discriminate among all bell states . moreover",
    ", this partial non - demolition bell measurement allows to continuously control the degree of the discrimination by the preparation of the state of ancilla .",
    "we have then proposed the teleportation scheme based on the partial bell measurement making it possible to continuously control the flow of information between the output qubits and it was proved that such a distribution of information is optimal in the sense that the teleportation and operation fidelity saturate the cloning inequality ( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "further , the measurement was shown to be optimal two - qubit quantum operation from the point of view of the trade - off between the gain of information and the state disturbance .",
    "analogic partial non - demolition bell measurement can be constructed for cvs .",
    "however , in contrast with qubits the cv partial quantum teleportation based on the measurement does not distribute the information optimally while the optimum is approached with increasing shared entanglement .",
