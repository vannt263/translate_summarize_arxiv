    "a regular curve @xmath7 is called _",
    "@xmath0-planar _ if there exist functions @xmath8 such that @xmath9 where @xmath10 .    from the definition",
    "we see immediately that the property of @xmath0-planarity is independent of the parameterisation of the curve , and that geodesics are @xmath0-planar curves .",
    "we also see that @xmath0-planar curves form a much bigger family than the family of geodesics ; at every point and in every direction there exist infinitely many geometrically different @xmath0-planar curves .",
    "two metrics @xmath5 and @xmath11 of arbitrary signature that are khler w.r.t the same complex structure @xmath0 are _ c - projectively equivalent _ if any @xmath0-planar curve of @xmath5 is a @xmath0-planar curve of @xmath11 .",
    "actually , the condition that the metrics are khler with respect to the same complex structure is not essential ; it is an easy exercise to show that if any @xmath0-planar curve of a khler structure @xmath12 is a @xmath13-planar curve of another khler structure @xmath14 , then @xmath15 .",
    "c - projective equivalence was introduced ( under the name `` h - projective equivalence '' ) by otsuki and tashiro in @xcite .",
    "their motivation was to generalise the notion of projective equivalence to the khler situation .",
    "since the notion of projective equivalence plays an essential role in our paper let us recall it .",
    "two metrics @xmath5 and @xmath11 of arbitrary signature are _ projectively equivalent _ , if each @xmath5-geodesic is , up to an appropriate reparameterisation , a @xmath11-geodesic .",
    "otsuki and tashiro have shown that projective equivalence is not interesting in the khler situation , since only simple examples are possible , and suggested c - projective equivalence as an interesting object of study instead .",
    "this suggestion appeared to be very fruitful and between the 1960s and the 1970s , the theory of c - projectively equivalent metrics and c - projective transformations was one of the main research topics in japanese and soviet ( mostly odessa and kazan ) differential geometry schools . for a collection of results of these times ,",
    "see for example the survey @xcite with more than 150 references .",
    "moreover , two classical books @xcite contain chapters on c - projectively equivalent metrics and connections .",
    "relatively recently c - projective equivalence was re - introduced , under different names and because of different motivation .",
    "in fact , c - projectively equivalent metrics are essentially the same as hamiltonian @xmath16-forms , defined and investigated in apostolov _",
    "though the definition of hamiltonian 2-forms is visually different from that of c - projectively equivalent metrics , the defining equation ( * ? ?",
    "* equation @xmath17 ) of a hamiltonian @xmath16-form is algebraically equivalent to a reformulation ( see below ) of the condition `` @xmath11 is c - projectively equivalent to @xmath5 '' into the language of pde .",
    "the motivation of apostolov _ et al . _ to study hamiltonian @xmath16-forms is different from that of otsuki and tashiro . roughly speaking , in @xcite apostolov _ et al . _",
    "observe that many interesting problems in khler geometry lead to hamiltonian @xmath16-forms and suggest studying them .",
    "the motivation is justified in @xcite , where the authors indeed construct interesting and useful examples of khler manifolds . in dimension",
    "@xmath18 , c - projectively equivalent metrics are also essentially the same as hermitian conformal killing ( or twistor ) @xmath19-forms studied in @xcite , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) or @xcite for details .",
    "finally , such metrics are closely related to the so - called khler - liouville integrable systems of type @xmath20 introduced by kiyohara _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "most recent interest in c - projectively equivalent metrics is due to the observation that one can study them with the help of so - called parabolic geometry .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "certain non - trivial applications of the methods of parabolic geometry in the theory of c - projective transformations are in @xcite .",
    "our paper contains three main results .",
    "the first result is a local description ( near a generic point ) of c - projectively equivalent khler metrics of arbitrary signature .",
    "if @xmath5 is positive definite , such a description follows from the local description of hamiltonian 2-forms due to apostolov _",
    "although the precise statements are slightly lengthy , we indeed provide an explicit description of the components of the metrics and of the khler form @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters in this description are almost arbitrary numbers and functions of one variable and , in certain cases , almost arbitrary affinely equivalent khler metrics of smaller dimension ( note that the description of affinely equivalent khler metrics was recently obtained by boubel in @xcite ) .",
    "it is hard to overestimate the future role of a local description in the local and global theory of c - projectively equivalent metrics .",
    "almost all known local results can easily be proved using it . roughly speaking , using the local description",
    ", one can reduce any problem that can be stated using geometric pdes ( for example , any problem involving the curvature ) to the analysis of a system of odes .",
    "as we mentioned above , in the positive definite case , the description of c - projectively equivalent metrics in the language of hamiltonian 2-forms is due to apostolov _",
    "@xcite , and with the help of such a description they did a lot .",
    "in particular they described possible topologies of closed manifolds admitting c - projectively equivalent metrics and constructed new examples of einstein and extremal metrics on closed manifolds , see @xcite .",
    "we expect similar applications of our description as well and , in particular , plan to study the topology of c - projectively equivalent closed khler manifolds of arbitrary signature in further papers .",
    "a demonstration of the importance of the local description is our second main result , which is a proof of the natural generalisation of the yano - obata conjecture for khler manifolds of arbitrary signature . a vector field on a khler manifold",
    "is called _ c - projective _ if its local flow sends @xmath0-planar curves to @xmath0-planar curves , and _ affine _ if its local flow preserves the levi - civita connection .",
    "[ thm : yano_obata ] let @xmath2 be a closed connected khler manifold of arbitrary signature and of real dimension @xmath22 such that it admits a c - projective vector field that is not an affine vector field",
    ". then the manifold is isometric to @xmath23 for some non - zero constant @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fubini - study metric .    for positive definite metrics ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : yano_obata ] was proved in @xcite , where also a history including a list of previously proven special cases can be found . the 4-dimensional version of theorem  [ thm : yano_obata ] was recently proved in @xcite .",
    "we see that a closed khler manifold with a non - affine c - projective vector field has definite signature .",
    "this phenomenon is , of course , essentially global since locally we can construct counterexamples in any signature . in dimension 4 , such examples are described in @xcite , and in proposition  [ prop : localclassgvfi ] we explicitly construct khler metrics of any dimension and any signature admitting non - affine c - projective vector fields .",
    "let us also mention ( see , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2 ) ) that @xmath23 admits many non - affine c - projective vector fields .    as a by - product of our proof of the yano - obata conjecture ( we explain in the next section why it is a by - product ) , we prove the possibly more popular _ projective lichnerowicz _",
    "conjecture for metrics of lorentzian signature .",
    "recall that a vector field is _ projective _ with respect to a ( arbitrary , not necessarily khler ) metric @xmath5 , if its local flow sends geodesics viewed as unparameterised curves to geodesics .",
    "[ thm : lichnerowicz ] let @xmath26 be a closed connected lorentzian manifold of dimension @xmath27 . then any projective vector field on @xmath28 is an affine vector field .    for riemannian metrics ,",
    "the analogue of theorem  [ thm : lichnerowicz ] was proved in @xcite ( dimension 2 ) and @xcite ( dimension greater that 2  this paper also contains a historical overview and a list of previously known special cases ) , see also @xcite . in japanese mathematics , this statement , at least in the riemannian setting , is also known as _ projective obata conjecture _ and was published many times as an important conjecture . for 2-dimensional lorentzian manifolds , theorem  [ thm : lichnerowicz ] was proved in @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that our proofs of the yano - obata and lichnerowicz conjectures are not generalisations of the proofs from @xcite , and are based on a different circle of ideas . in general , it is difficult to extend global statements about riemannian metrics to the pseudo - riemannian setting , since many `` global '' methods require definiteness of the metrics .",
    "this is also the case in our situation ; the main ingredients of the proofs of @xcite are the global ordering of the eigenvalues of the endomorphisms @xmath20 and @xmath29 ( given by and  these endomorphisms play an important role in our paper ) , and an investigation of the behaviour of the sectional and holomorphic sectional curvature along the integral curves of the projective and c - projective vector fields ( in @xcite it is shown that these curvatures are either constant or unbounded ) . both ingredients do not exist in the case of indefinite signature ; examples show that the eigenvalues of @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) are not globally ordered anymore , and the unboundedness of the sectional curvature does not lead to any contradiction , since for metrics of indefinite signature the sectional or holomorphic sectional curvature is either constant or unbounded . moreover , as follows from our calculations in  [ ssec : l23 ] , in the indefinite case , all curvature invariants along the integral curves of the projective and c - projective vector fields can be bounded .",
    "other proofs of special cases of the yano - obata and lichnerowicz conjecture ( see e.g. @xcite ) are based on the bochner technique , which also requires that the metric is definite .      the local description of c - projectively equivalent metrics will be given in theorem  [ thm : localclassification ] in  [ sec : lc ]",
    "( which does not require this paragraph so a hurried reader can directly go there ) .",
    "the goal of this section is to explain the main idea of our solution .",
    "we hope that this allows the reader to see the geometry behind the formulas and also may be used in many other problems related to c - projectively equivalent metrics .",
    "experts always expected that projectively equivalent metrics must have a close relation with c - projectively equivalent metrics .",
    "the expectation is based on the following informal observation : most mathematicians that studied c - projectively equivalent metrics and c - projective vector fields studied projectively equivalent metrics and projective vector fields before .",
    "it appears that many ideas and many results in the theory of projectively equivalent metrics have their counterparts in the c - projective setting , though most of the proofs in the c - projective setting are longer and are more involved than their projective analogues .",
    "we suggest an explanation why the theories are closely related , which is simultaneously the main idea of our description .",
    "the following observation , which we formalise ( and give a self - contained proof ) in  [ sec : killing ] , is crucial : c - projectively , but not affinely equivalent metrics @xmath5 and @xmath11 allow us to construct vector fields @xmath30 which preserve the complex structure and which are killing with respect to both metrics . for hamiltonian 2-forms ( at least for a positive definite metric ) ,",
    "the existence of these killing vector fields was shown by apostolov _",
    "@xcite , and in the framework of khler - liouville manifolds ( under certain non - degeneracy assumptions ) their existence was observed by kiyohara and topalov @xcite .",
    "we consider the local action of these vector fields and the local quotient @xmath31 of @xmath28 with respect to this action ( it will be shown that such a quotient is well - defined near a generic point ) .",
    "let us denote the quotient metrics by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "notice that @xmath31 is not a khler quotient and the metrics @xmath32 and @xmath33 are in general not khler .",
    "the following statements hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are projectively equivalent ; 2 .",
    "the metrics @xmath5 and @xmath11 can be reconstructed from @xmath32 and @xmath33 in a relatively straightforward way .",
    "recently , projectively equivalent metrics have been explicitly locally described in @xcite .",
    "we obtain our description of c - projectively equivalent metrics by taking the formulas from @xcite for the quotient metrics @xmath32 and @xmath33 and then `` reconstructing '' @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , not every pair of projectively equivalent metrics @xmath34 , @xmath33 as considered in @xcite can be obtained from a pair @xmath5 , @xmath11 of c - projectively equivalent metrics : we will describe the conditions that @xmath32 and @xmath33 have to satisfy in order to arise as quotients from c - projectively equivalent metrics .",
    "these additional conditions actually simplify the formulas for the metrics @xmath34 , @xmath33 as compared to the formulas from @xcite for the general case .",
    "moreover , we show , assuming these conditions are satisfied , how to effectively reconstruct the initial metrics @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "this yields our description of c - projectively equivalent khler metrics .",
    "the relation between projectively and c - projectively equivalent metrics plays also an important role in the proof of the yano - obata conjecture .",
    "we will see that under the additional assumption that the degree of mobility is @xmath16 ( which means that the `` space of c - projectively equivalent metrics '' is two - dimensional  the formal definition is in  [ conv ] where it is also explained why it is the most non - trivial case in the proof of the yano - obata conjecture ) , a c - projective vector field on the initial manifold reduces to a projective vector field on the quotient .",
    "we expect further applications of this observation which suggests , in the metric setting , an almost algorithmic way to produce results in c - projective geometry from results in projective geometry and the latter is much better developed .",
    "unfortunately , this almost algorithmic way does not automatically work in the other ( c - projective @xmath35 projective ) direction .",
    "the reason is that the quotient metrics @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as already noticed , satisfy certain additional conditions .",
    "the most important of them is as follows : for the metrics @xmath36 and @xmath37 the endomorphism @xmath29 given by below has no jordan blocks with nonconstant eigevalues . for general projectively equivalent metrics , @xmath29 may have non - trivial jordan blocks with nonconstant eigevalues .",
    "this is the only reason why we can not modify the proof of the yano - obata conjecture to obtain the proof of the projective lichnerowicz conjectures _ for metrics of all signatures_. for the metrics _ of lorentzian signature _ , at most one non - trivial jordan block may occur and after some additional work in   [ sec : jblock ] we exclude this case in the proof of the projective lichnerowicz conjecture .",
    "the rest of the proof of the projective lichnerowicz conjecture is a straightforward modification ( actually , a simplification ) of the proof of the yano - obata conjecture and when proving the projective lichnerowicz conjecture in the `` no - jordan - blocks '' case ( theorem [ specialcase2 ] ) , we confine ourselves with a series of remarks explaining necessary amendments .",
    "let @xmath2 be a khler manifold of real dimension @xmath22 and let @xmath4 and @xmath6 denote the levi - civita connection and khler form respectively .",
    "we do not require that @xmath5 or any other khler metric that appears has positive signature .    instead of the pair @xmath38 of c - projectively equivalent metrics",
    "it is appropriate to consider the pair @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a hermitian ( i.e. @xmath5-selfadjoint and @xmath0-commuting ) endomorphism constructed from @xmath5 and @xmath41 by @xmath42 in this formula , we view @xmath43 as bundle isomorphisms . in tensor notation",
    "( with summation convention in force ) , @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the inverse to @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 .    clearly , one can reconstruct @xmath11 from the pair @xmath39 and obtains @xmath48 the endomorphism @xmath20 , introduced in @xcite , plays an important role in the theory of c - projectively equivalent metrics .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the condition that @xmath5 and @xmath41 are c - projectively equivalent amounts to the fact that the tensor @xmath20 satisfies the _ linear _ partial differential equation @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we say that @xmath5 and @xmath20 are _ compatible in the c - projective sense _ or just _ c - compatible _ if @xmath20 is a hermitian endomorphism solving .",
    "in particular , any hermitian endomorphism @xmath20 with nowhere vanishing determinant and c - compatible with @xmath5 gives us a c - projectively equivalent metric @xmath11 by , this metric is automatically khler with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "another reason for working with @xmath20 instead of @xmath11 is that in our local description , the formulas for @xmath39 are much simpler than those for @xmath53 .",
    "we describe locally all khler structures @xmath54 admitting solutions @xmath20 to in theorem  [ thm : localclassification ] below .",
    "since the description is relatively complicated , we first consider two special cases corresponding to the `` weakest '' ( theorem  [ ex : constant ] ) and `` strongest '' ( theorem  [ thm : nonconstant ] ) case of c - projective equivalence .",
    "note that any parallel hermitian endomorphism @xmath20 ( i.e. , satisfying @xmath55 ) , in particular the identity @xmath56 , is a solution to .",
    "such solutions correspond to khler metrics @xmath11 which are affinely equivalent to @xmath5 , i.e. , which have the same levi - civita connection as @xmath5 .",
    "[ well - known special case of theorem  [ thm : localclassification ] ] [ ex : constant ] let @xmath2 be a khler manifold of arbitrary signature and @xmath40 a parallel hermitian endomorphism . then locally @xmath2 is a direct product of khler manifolds @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath20 decomposes as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a parallel hermitian endomorphism on @xmath57 having either a single real eigenvalue @xmath61 or a pair of complex - conjugate eigenvalues @xmath62 .",
    "the above theorem is just the de rham  wu decomposition @xcite of the khler manifold into components corresponding to the parallel distributions given by the generalised eigenspaces of @xmath20 .",
    "this is not a complete description of pairs @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is khler and @xmath20 is a parallel hermitian endomorphism : what is left is an explicit description of the blocks @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the positive definite case ,",
    "the description of these blocks is trivial since in this case @xmath66 is a constant multiple of @xmath67 . if the signature of @xmath68 is arbitrary , the local description of @xmath69 and @xmath66 has recently been obtained by c. boubel in @xcite .",
    "boubel s description of @xmath70 is quite complicated , we will not repeat it here and refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "let us reformulate the statement from theorem  [ ex : constant ] in matrix notation : we can find local coordinates such that the matrices of @xmath5 , @xmath0 and @xmath20 in these coordinates are block - diagonal with the same structure of blocks : @xmath71 in all matrices , the components of each block only depend on the corresponding coordinates and for each @xmath58 the endomorphism @xmath66 is hermitian and parallel w.r.t . the khler structure @xmath69 .    the `` main idea '' and `` main observation '' described in ",
    "[ sec : idea ] become vacuous in the setting of theorem  [ ex : constant ] : the number of `` canonical '' killing vector fields @xmath30 is zero , hence , the quotient of the manifold is the manifold itself .",
    "the `` main observation '' remains , of course , formally true but in this case projective equivalence is affine equivalence .",
    "a special feature of the situation described in theorem  [ ex : constant ] is that the eigenvalues of @xmath20 are constant , and may have high multiplicities .",
    "let us now consider the `` strongest '' special case of c - projective equivalence : all eigenvalues of @xmath20 are non - constant ( when considered as functions on @xmath28 ) , and their multiplicity is minimal possible .",

    "moreover , if @xmath29 is @xmath72-selfadjoint and non - degenerate , then is equivalent to the projective equivalence of @xmath72 and @xmath73 given by @xmath78 see @xcite and e.g. @xcite . to emphasize both the difference and similarity with c - compatibility introduced above",

    "<S> two khler metrics on a complex manifold are called c - projectively equivalent if their @xmath0-planar curves coincide . </S>",
    "<S> these curves are defined by the property that the acceleration is complex proportional to the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we give an explicit local description of all pairs of c - projectively equivalent khler metrics of arbitrary signature and use this description to prove the classical yano - obata conjecture : we show that on a closed connected khler manifold of arbitrary signature , any c - projective vector field is an affine vector field unless the manifold is @xmath1 with ( a multiple of ) the fubini - study metric . as a by - product </S>",
