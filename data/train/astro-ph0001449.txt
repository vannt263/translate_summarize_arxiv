    "only a small fraction of elliptical galaxies emit at radio wavelengths .",
    "this is probably due to the combination of two factors : 1 ) the lifetime of the radio source is much less than the typical lifetime of the host galaxy ; 2 ) not all elliptical galaxies may harbor the conditions for radio activity .",
