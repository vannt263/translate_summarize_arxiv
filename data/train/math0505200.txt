    "michael lifshits ( unpublished ) , exploiting a type of construction attributed to r.  penrose ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , constructed a class of pairs of planar domains that , while not isometric , have periodic geodesics of exactly the same lengths ( including multiplicities ) .",
    "at least when the boundaries are smooth ( @xmath0 ) , it follows that the two billiards have the same wave invariants , in the sense that the traces of their wave groups , @xmath1 , differ at most by a smooth function  @xcite . in a recent review of the inverse spectral problem @xcite s.",
    "zelditch asked whether the dirichlet laplacians , @xmath2 , for the two domains are necessarily isospectral , judging that proposition `` dubious '' but not yet refuted .",
    "given the refutation , such billiards provide a kind of converse to the famous examples of `` drums that sound the same '' @xcite , being drums that sound different but are very similar geometrically  in fact , in the geometrical features deemed most relevant to spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we show how to construct smooth penrose ",
    "lifshits mushroom pairs that are not isospectral , and we argue that inequality of the dirichlet spectra is , in fact , quite generic . since the domains are smooth ( but not convex ) , the spectral difference is not attributable to diffraction from corners , which would muddy the definition or the relevance of `` periodic geodesics '' .",
    "the construction of a mushroom starts from a half - ellipse @xmath3 with foci @xmath4 and  @xmath5 :        we use the tilde , whether applied to regions , curves , or points , to indicate the operation of reflection through the minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "if two entities are interchanged by that reflection , we call them _ dual_. next , add two bumps , @xmath6 on the left and @xmath7 on the right , with @xmath8 , to form a smooth domain  @xmath9 :        finally , add another bump ( not self - dual ) between the foci in two dual ways ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) to get two domains @xmath12 :            we call the domains @xmath13 and @xmath14 constructed in this manner _ a penrose  lifshits mushroom pair_.    we repeat that the bumps can be added in such a way that the boundaries remain smooth",
    ". that assumption , however , is needed mainly to draw a clean conclusion about equality of the length spectra . the conclusions about the dirichlet spectra hold even if the domain has corners ( in which case bump @xmath7 is superfluous ) .",
    "[ t : non - isospectral ] if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given and not dual , then there exist dual bumps @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that the resulting penrose  lifshits mushrooms @xmath15 have the same length spectra and wave invariants but are not isospectral .",
    "first we review the proof that the length spectra coincide @xcite .",
    "the geodesics in an ellipse fall into two disjoint categories @xcite : those that intersect the major axis between the foci , and those that do so at or beyond the foci .",
    "( the only exception is the major axis itself .",
    "the smoothness assumption guarantees that the major axis will not bifurcate in @xmath15 by diffraction . )",
    "it follows that a similar division holds for the domains @xmath15 we have just described : any geodesic originating in a bump @xmath6 or @xmath7 can never reach a bump @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and vice versa .",
    "now , the geodesics that do not intersect the focal segment @xmath16 are exactly the same for the two domains . on the other hand , those for @xmath13 that do intersect this segment are identified one - to - one with their duals in @xmath14 by the reflection operation .",
    "this shows length isospectrality .",
    "equality of the wave traces modulo smooth functions follows from the hyperbolic propagation of singularities along geodesics  see @xcite and references therein .",
    "our main task is to show nonisospectrality for some choice of @xmath10 .",
    "consider the spectrum of @xmath13 assuming that the bump @xmath10 is small and has support on the left half of the focal segment ; i.e. , to construct @xmath13 the ( open ) segment @xmath17 in the boundary of @xmath9 is perturbed by the graph of a smooth , compactly supported ( and nonpositive ) function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a small parameter .",
    "let @xmath20 be the ground state of the dirichlet laplacian on @xmath9 and @xmath21 be the corresponding lowest eigenvalue .",
    "the known rayleigh ",
    "hadamard formula for change of the spectrum under domain perturbations ( e.g. , @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 15.1 , exercise 9 ) ) shows that if @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normal derivative of the eigenfunction on the boundary , then the lowest eigenvalue @xmath21 changes under the perturbation .",
    "in fact , this integral gives the derivative at @xmath24 of the lowest eigenvalue with respect to  @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if we could guarantee that the values of this integral are different for the two small perturbation domains @xmath12 , this would imply their non - isospectrality : the lowest dirichlet eigenvalues would change with different velocities . since the choice of the perturbation shape @xmath25 is in our hands , in order to make these integrals different , and thus domains nonisospectral , it is sufficient to have two mutually dual segments inside the focal segment such that the square of the normal derivative of the ground state is not an even function on their union ,  @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , in this case we could find an even perturbation @xmath25 that would provide nonequal integrals ( in fact , almost any perturbation would do ) .",
    "[ l : lemma ] if the bumps @xmath27 are not dual with respect to the minor axis of the ellipse , there is no self - dual union @xmath26 of two segments inside @xmath16 such that the square of the normal derivative @xmath28 of the ground state @xmath20 for @xmath9 is even on  @xmath26 .",
    "* proof of the lemma .",
    "* suppose that @xmath29 is even on @xmath26 .",
    "since the normal derivative is continuous , by shrinking @xmath26 if necessary , we may assume that @xmath30 itself is either even or odd on @xmath26 .",
    "suppose first that the normal derivative is even .",
    "introduce the orthogonal cartesian coordinates centered at @xmath31 and with @xmath32-axis going along the major axis .",
    "consider the function @xmath33 . both @xmath20 and @xmath34 satisfy the same eigenfunction equation inside the half - ellipse @xmath3 and have the same cauchy data on  @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , according to holmgren s uniqueness theorem , they agree on their common domain . in particular , @xmath20 must satisfy zero dirichlet boundary conditions not only on @xmath35 , but also on its mirror reflection with respect to the minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "since the bumps @xmath27 are assumed not dual to each other , we conclude that @xmath20 vanishes somewhere inside  @xmath9 ( or @xmath34 somewhere inside  @xmath36 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath20 has a nodal curve , which is well known to be impossible for a ground state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath28 is odd on @xmath26 , one only needs to define @xmath34 as @xmath37 to obtain an analogous contradiction .",
    "this concludes the proof of the lemma , and hence of theorem [ t : non - isospectral ] .",
    "in fact , a closer look at the proof of the theorem shows that the nonisospectrality holds for smooth penrose  lifshits mushrooms @xmath15 for any nondual bumps @xmath27 and for `` generic '' dual bumps @xmath38 :    [ t : generic ] for any fixed choice of nondual bumps @xmath39 , nonisospectrality holds for an open and dense ( in @xmath0-topology ) set of penrose  lifshits pairs  @xmath12 .    indeed",
    ", the set of nonisospectral pairs @xmath15 is obviously open .",
    "the previous theorem states that the closure of this set contains the domain @xmath9 ( i.e. , the one where the bumps @xmath40 are absent ) . to show density",
    ", one can apply a similar proof by small perturbation to any pair of mushroom domains @xmath15 of the type constructed above . indeed",
    ", if the pair is already non - isospectral , there is nothing to prove .",
    "if it is isospectral , let @xmath41 be the ground state in @xmath15 .",
    "as in theorem [ t : non - isospectral ] , the perturbation method described above works if one can show absence of a dual pair @xmath42 of pieces of the boundaries @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , @xmath45 and that @xmath46 is equal after reflection to @xmath47 .",
    "now , the same consideration as in the proof of lemma [ l : lemma ] applies to justify this claim .",
    "* a different proof of generic non - isospectrality claimed in theorem [ t : generic ] follows from existence of non - isospectral mushroom domains ( theorem [ t : non - isospectral ] ) , analytic dependence of the ground state on the domain @xcite , and connectedness of the manifold of these domains . *",
    "as it is not hard to establish , the set of non - isospectral mushroom pairs is open in a much weaker topology than @xmath0 . indeed ,",
    "if the domains @xmath15 are distorted by a pair of dual ( in the sense used in this text ) @xmath48-diffeomorphisms that are @xmath48-close to identity , the non - isospectrality is preserved .",
    "* one can find discussion of the effects of domain variation for general elliptic boundary value problems in the nice little book @xcite , which regrettably is available only in russian .",
    "some of its results can be found in preceding publications of the authors of that book .",
    "this small note is the result of discussion at a working seminar of the recent survey @xcite by steve zelditch .",
    "the authors would like to thank the seminar participants g.  berkolaiko , j.  harrison and b.  winn , as well as s.  zelditch and j. zhou , for discussion and useful comments .",
