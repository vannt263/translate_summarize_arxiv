    "in this introduction we first summarize some ideas and results of the works of v. baldazzi , s. cocco , e. marinari and r. monasson ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and s. cocco and r. monasson @xcite who are interested in a method for dna molecules sequencing .",
    "they study a mechanical way , described below , instead of traditional bio - chemical or gel electrophoresis technics .",
    "the experiments for mechanical unzipping were first realized by bockelmann , helsot and coworkers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the principle is based on the fact that the link strength between two bases of a given pair depends on whether it is a @xmath0 or a @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "moreover , there are also some stacking effects between adjacent bases , that is to say , the force needed to break , for example , the link @xmath4 is different if the @xmath5 is following by a @xmath6 , or a @xmath7 .",
    "this last factor is not negligible ( see the table below ) and therefore must be taken into account if we want the model to be as sharp as possible .",
    "notice that the largest free energies which correspond to the most stable links are on the bottom right end corner of the table , in fact the largest binding energy is obtained when a @xmath8 is followed by a @xmath5 .",
    "notice also that @xmath9 so we can not distinguish these two different links by looking only at the free energy . in the same way the lowest free energy is produced by bases @xmath7 and @xmath6 followed by the same letters , once again @xmath10 . for the rest of the table we have the equality @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is either a @xmath5 or a @xmath8 and @xmath13 a @xmath6 or a @xmath7 , @xmath14 ( respectively @xmath15 ) is the complementary of @xmath12 ( respectively of @xmath13 ) .",
    "moreover it is possible to reconstruct the dna molecule from the compatible binding energies only if there is only one sequence of base pairs which corresponds to the sequence of energies ( see theorem [ estiglob ] ) .",
    "this is not always the case , for example when the molecule repeats the same scheme : the energy of @xmath16 is equal to the energy of @xmath17 , in the same way @xmath18 has the same energy than @xmath19 .",
    "notice that if these highly improbable sequences are broken only once in the molecule then we turn back to a solvable case .",
