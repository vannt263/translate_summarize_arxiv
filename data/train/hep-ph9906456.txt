    "the super - kamiokande measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite has launched the physics of massive neutrinos @xcite into a new era of model - independent evidence .",
    "hopefully other experiments will provide in the near future further model - independent information on neutrino masses and mixing through the observation of solar neutrinos ( sno , borexino and others , see @xcite ) , atmospheric and long - baseline accelerator neutrinos ( see @xcite ) , short - baseline accelerator neutrinos ( see @xcite ) and reactor neutrinos ( see @xcite ) .    at present",
    "there are three types of experiments that provide indications in favor of neutrino oscillations : solar neutrino experiments ( homestake , kamiokande , gallex , sage and super - kamiokande @xcite ) , atmospheric neutrino experiments ( kamiokande , imb , super - kamiokande , soudan-2 and macro @xcite ) ) and the accelerator lsnd experiment @xcite . in order to accommodate these experimental results",
    "at least three independent neutrino mass - squared differences are needed ( see @xcite for a simple proof ) : @xmath9 the two possibilities ( see @xcite ) for the solar mass - squared difference @xmath10 correspond , respectively , to the vacuum oscillation ( vo ) solution and to the msw effect @xcite .",
    "three independent neutrino mass - squared differences require the existence of at least four light massive neutrinos . here",
    "we consider the minimal possibility of four light massive neutrinos that allows to explain all the data of neutrino oscillation experiments . in this case , in the flavor basis the three active neutrinos @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are accompanied by a sterile neutrino @xmath14 that does not take part in standard weak interactions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further constraints on neutrino mixing can be obtained from the measurement of the primordial abundance of light elements produced in big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( see @xcite ) and from the results of neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay experiments ( @xmath15 ) ( see @xcite ) , assuming that massive neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the analysis of recent astrophysical data yields the upper bound @xcite",
    "@xmath16 for the effective number of neutrinos in bbn , although the issue is still rather controversial ( see @xcite ) . in the framework of four - neutrino mixing , the upper bound @xmath17 implies that atmospheric neutrino oscillations occur in the @xmath18 channel and solar neutrino oscillations occur in the @xmath19 channel @xcite . in this case only the small mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem is allowed , with @xmath20 at 99% cl @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is the two - neutrino mixing angle used in the analysis of solar neutrino data .",
    "solar neutrino experiments ( sno , borexino and others , see @xcite ) could prove the dominance of the @xmath19 channel in solar neutrino oscillations in the near future , hopefully in a model - independent way @xcite .",
    "the dominance of @xmath18 oscillations for atmospheric neutrinos will be checked by future atmospheric and long - baseline experiments ( see @xcite ) .",
    "already the fit of super - kamiokande data favors the @xmath18 with respect to the @xmath22 channel @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that in the framework of four - neutrino mixing the bbn bound ( [ n_nu^bbn ] ) implies that solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are effectively decoupled and the two - generation analyses of solar and atmospheric neutrino data yield correct information on the @xmath23 four - neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .    if massive neutrinos are majorana particles , the matrix element of @xmath15 decay is proportional to the effective majorana mass @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mixing matrix that connects the flavor neutrino fields @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) to the fields @xmath28 of neutrinos with masses @xmath29 through the relation @xmath30 the present experimental upper limit for @xmath31 is @xcite @xmath32 the uncertainty of a factor of two for this upper bound stems from the uncertainty of the theoretical calculation of the nuclear matrix element @xcite .",
    "the next generation of @xmath15 decay experiments is expected to be sensitive to values of @xmath31 in the range @xmath33 ev @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath31 as small as about @xmath34 ev may be reached not far in the future @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that only one mass spectrum with four neutrinos can accommodate the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments , the bbn bound ( [ n_nu^bbn ] ) and the neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay limit ( [ m - bb ] ) ( assuming that massive neutrinos are majorana particles ) : @xmath35 this mass spectrum is characterized by having @xmath36 in the framework of the mass spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) the bbn bound ( [ n_nu^bbn ] ) gives a strong constraint on the mixing of the sterile neutrino with the two `` heavy mass '' eigenstates @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath39 or @xmath40 if the weaker bound @xmath17 is correct .    in this paper",
    "we consider the mass spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) and we present , in section [ the ms2 mixing scheme ] , a simple mixing scheme that can accommodate the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments ( the solar , atmospheric and lsnd indications in favor of neutrino oscillations and the negative results of all the other experiments ) , the bbn bound ( [ n_nu^bbn ] ) and the neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay bound ( [ m - bb ] ) . in sections [ short - baseline experiments ] , [ long - baseline experiments ] , [ neutrinoless double - beta decay ] and [ tritium beta - decay experiments ] we discuss the predictions of the scheme under consideration for short - baseline oscillation experiments , long - baseline oscillation experiments , neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay experiments and tritium @xmath0-decay experiments , respectively .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the bbn bound ( [ n_nu^bbn ] ) implies that the @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath1@xmath2 sectors of the @xmath23 neutrino mixing matrix are approximately decoupled : in the @xmath41 basis we have @xmath42 here @xmath21 is the solar mixing angle whose allowed range is given in eq .",
    "( [ sma ] ) and @xmath43 is the atmospheric mixing angle whose 90% cl allowed range is @xcite @xmath44 since the best fit of the super - kamiokande data is obtained in the case of maximal mixing , @xmath45 , and theoretically maximal or small mixing angles are preferred in comparison with intermediate configurations ( the large mixing angle in the @xmath1@xmath2 sector could be related to the almost degeneracy of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , whereas the small mixing angle in the @xmath3@xmath4 sector could be related to the hierarchy @xmath46 ) , in the following we consider the case of maximal mixing in the @xmath1@xmath2 sector ( corrections to this scheme due to @xmath47 can be easily computed ) : @xmath48    the mixing matrix ( [ mix12 ] ) can not be exact , because it can not accommodate the @xmath49 and @xmath50 oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment .",
    "indeed , the probability of @xmath51 transitions for neutrinos with energy @xmath52 in a short - baseline experiment with a source - detector distance @xmath53 is @xcite @xmath54 with the oscillation amplitude @xmath55 one can easily see that if the mixing matrix ( [ mix12 ] ) were exact the amplitude @xmath56 of short - baseline @xmath50 oscillations would vanish , in contrast with the lsnd result .",
    "( the expression ( [ a_alpha - beta ] ) implies that @xmath57 and cp or t violation effects are not observable in short - baseline experiments independently from the value of the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite . )",
    "the simplest way to generalize the mixing matrix ( [ mix12 ] ) in order to accommodate the lsnd oscillations is to rotate its @xmath11@xmath12 sector by a small angle .",
    "there are four rotations that can be performed in the @xmath5@xmath58 sectors , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , small rotations in the @xmath5@xmath61 and/or @xmath5@xmath62 sectors are not effective in generating @xmath50 transitions because @xmath11 has large mixing with @xmath63 and small mixing with @xmath64 , in order to accommodate the small mixing angle solution ( [ sma ] ) of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "moreover , such rotations generate relatively large elements @xmath65 and/or @xmath66 , that are incompatible with the bbn bound ( [ cs - bound ] ) .",
    "hence , small rotations in the @xmath5@xmath61 and/or @xmath5@xmath62 sectors are excluded . on the other hand , small rotations in the @xmath5@xmath6 and/or @xmath5@xmath7 sectors",
    "are effective in generating the @xmath50 oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment and the resulting mixing matrix is compatible with the bbn constraint ( [ cs - bound ] ) .",
    "if both rotations are allowed the resulting mixing matrix is quite complicated and difficult to handle .",
    "therefore , we assume that one of the mixings in the @xmath5@xmath6 and/or @xmath5@xmath7 dominates over the other .",
    "which one dominates is irrelevant for the resulting phenomenology , because the two possibilities give equivalent predictions for neutrino oscillations experiments , neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay experiments and tritium @xmath0-decay experiments . in the following",
    "we will consider explicitly the case of dominance of the mixing in the @xmath5@xmath6 sector .",
    "hence , we rotate the @xmath5@xmath6 sector by a small angle @xmath67 [ the coefficient @xmath68 is introduced in order to allow the interpretation of @xmath69 as the usual mixing angle measured in the lsnd experiment ; see eq .",
    "( [ amue2 ] ) ] : @xmath70 that yields @xmath71 we call ms@xmath8 the mixing scheme represented by this matrix , which has maximal mixing in the @xmath1@xmath2 sector and small mixings in the @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 sectors . for simplicity",
    ", we did not introduce any cp - violating phase or different cp parities for the massive neutrinos ( see @xcite ) , because there is no information at present on these quantities .",
    "hence , in the following we will not make any distinction between the oscillations of neutrinos and antineutrinos .    the amplitude of short - baseline @xmath50 oscillations that follows from the ms@xmath8 mixing matrix ( [ ms2 ] ) is @xmath72 taking into account the fact that the mixings @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 sectors are small ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , we have @xmath75 hence , @xmath69 can be identified with the mixing angle measured in the lsnd experiment . from the results of the lsnd experiment it follows that the preferred range for @xmath76 ( 90% likelihood region ) is @xcite @xmath77    the ms@xmath8 mixing matrix is compatible with",
    "the bbn bound ( [ cs - bound ] ) .",
    "indeed , in the ms@xmath8 mixing scheme we have @xmath78 that is doubly suppressed by the smallness of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the limits ( [ sma ] ) and ( [ lsnd ] ) we obtain @xmath81 that is well compatible with the bound ( [ cs - bound ] ) .",
    "let us finish this section by emphasizing that the ms@xmath8 mixing matrix ( [ ms2 ] ) is a valid approximation of the real neutrino mixing matrix if the mixing in the @xmath5@xmath6 sector dominates over the mixing in the @xmath5@xmath7 sector .",
    "both mixings are allowed by the data .",
    "the opposite situation in which the mixing in the @xmath5@xmath7 sector dominates over the mixing in the @xmath5@xmath6 sector produces a mixing matrix that can be obtained from the one in eq .",
    "( [ ms2 ] ) by exchanging the third and fourth columns and leads to the same phenomenology .",
    "the ms@xmath8 mixing scheme provides precise predictions for the amplitudes of @xmath18 , @xmath82 , @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath83 in short - baseline experiments : @xmath84 the approximations in eqs .",
    "( [ amutau ] ) and ( [ aes ] ) are valid because of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 are quadratically suppressed by the smallness of @xmath79 and @xmath80 and the amplitude @xmath89 is even cubically suppressed .",
    "hence the oscillations in the corresponding channels will be very difficult to observe .",
    "on the other hand , the equality of the amplitudes @xmath90 and @xmath56 , that are suppressed only linearly by the smallness of @xmath80 , could be checked in a not too far future , perhaps with neutrino beams produced in muon storage rings @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that ( obviously ) in the ms@xmath8 mixing scheme ( as well as in any four - neutrino mixing scheme compatible with the present neutrino oscillation data ) short - baseline oscillations in all channels are generated by the same mass - squared difference @xmath91 and this prediction can and must be checked experimentally .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath92s in short baseline experiments is given by @xcite @xmath93 with the oscillation amplitudes @xmath94 since in the ms@xmath8 mixing scheme @xmath95 and @xmath89 is negligible , for the survival probability of @xmath11s in short - baseline experiments we have @xmath96 in general the oscillation amplitude @xmath56 is constrained by the unitarity inequality @xmath97 and this bound has been used in order to restrict the lsnd - preferred region in the @xmath56@xmath91 plane @xcite using the exclusion curve obtained in the bugey @xcite @xmath11 disappearance experiment . from eq .",
    "( [ bee ] ) it follows that in the ms@xmath8 scheme the constraint on @xmath56 coming from the bugey exclusion curve is stronger : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the upper limit for @xmath100 obtained in the bugey experiment ( @xmath100 coincides with the parameter @xmath101 used in the two - generation analysis of the bugey data ) .",
    "it is clear that this stronger bound is due to the fact that in the ms@xmath8 mixing scheme @xmath102 and @xmath82 transitions contribute equally to the disappearance of @xmath11s in short - baseline experiments .",

    "<S> we present a simple scheme of mixing of four neutrinos that can accommodate the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments , the observed abundances of primordial elements and the current upper bound for the effective majorana neutrino mass in neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay ( assuming that massive neutrinos are majorana particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme has maximal mixing in the @xmath1@xmath2 sector and small mixings in the @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 ( or @xmath5@xmath7 ) sectors ( ms@xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this scheme for short and long baseline oscillation experiments and for neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay and tritium @xmath0-decay experiments . </S>"
