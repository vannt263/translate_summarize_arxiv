    "one of the most important goals in modern cosmology is to understand the formation of galaxies and large - scale structures . according to the currently prevalent theory for structure formation , biased hierarchical buildup within the @xmath10cdm framework ( hereafter referred to as @xmath10cdm ) ,",
    "the growth of large galaxies results from mergers between smaller systems , with more massive galaxies hosted within more massive dark matter halos , themselves the rarest , most biased overdensities in the underlying mass distribution .",
    "observations of qsos and other massive systems are thus an excellent way of testing structure formation models .",
    "this is particularly apposite for qsos at very high redshifts , where the added constraint of the youth of the cosmos allows for the most stringent tests .",
    "the discovery @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey of qsos at @xmath11 , when the universe was ( under any currently favored cosmology ) less than one gyr old , presents the opportunity to perform such tests .",
    "the first step is to determine the nature of the central engines in these qsos , as @xmath10cdm models generally extrapolate the host halo mass from the central black hole mass @xcite .",
    "this is readily achieved using x - ray observations , which directly probe the central engines of qsos , largely free of obscuration bias .",
    "deep x - ray observations of @xmath11 qsos , to measure their x - ray spectral shapes and luminosities , can therefore be used to examine the properties of their central black holes , and to compare to the x - ray properties of lower redshift qsos to search for drivers behind the strong evolution of the qso luminosity function @xcite .",
    "one such qso is sdss j1030 + 0524 at 10@xmath1230@xmath1327@xmath14.1 + 05@xmath1524@xmath1355@xmath14.0 ( j2000 ) , with a redshift of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "deep imaging observations show that this qso is not significantly lensed @xcite or beamed @xcite , and that the rest - frame optical continuum shape and luminosity are probably similar to those of lower redshift qsos @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame uv spectrum shows an almost complete gunn - peterson trough , indicating that this qso lies within the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "further observations found evidence for supersolar metallicities @xcite and indirect evidence for a formed host galaxy @xcite .",
    "although not detected in the sub - mm @xcite , the radio @xcite or the rosat all - sky survey , this qso is detected in chandra snapshot observations @xcite . in this letter , we present deep xmm - newton observations of sdss j1030 + 0524 .",
    "we assume @xmath16 , @xmath17 and h@xmath18 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 .",
    "sdss j1030 + 0524 was observed continuously by xmm - newton for 105ks in may 2003 .",
    "the source was placed on axis , and observed by all the onboard instruments , although we only consider data from the european photon imaging counter ( epic ) metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) and pn cameras here .",
    "the data were reduced using the xmm science analysis system ( sas ) v6.0 package .",
    "the event lists were filtered to include only single and double events ( patterns 0 - 4 for the pn and 0 - 12 for the mos ) with quality flag 0 , and to remove time periods during which the background was excessively high due to proton flares .",
    "light curves were extracted using the whole mos and pn fields of view to check that all the flaring background periods had been removed .",
    "the resulting effective exposure time was @xmath20ks .",
    "the source spectrum was extracted using a circular aperture of radius 45  centered on the source , and the background spectrum was extracted from a contiguous region free from sources and with the same instrumental background as our target .",
    "additional light curves were extracted from the same region as the source spectra to search for short - term variability from the qso .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using the xspec v11.3 package @xcite , using spectra binned to have at least 20 counts per bin .",
    "before undertaking detailed analysis , we checked for consistency between the three epic detectors by fitting the mos and pn spectra with single power - law models .",
    "the derived photon indices and normalizations agreed to within @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore proceeded to fit the three spectra simultaneously .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524 is presented in figure [ spectrum ] .",
    "the final spectrum contained @xmath22 counts in total , where 340 were detected by the pn camera and 220 by the two mos cameras .",
    "a summary of the results from spectral fitting is given in table [ specfit ] .",
    "for all fits we assumed a galactic hydrogen column of 3.2@xmath23 @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we first considered a single power law model .",
    "this gave a reasonable fit to the combined spectrum with a photon index of @xmath3 .",
    "we speculate that the excess flux between 0.9 - 1.0 kev may arise from a complex of iron emission features ( 6.4 - 7.0 kev rest - frame ) , however the flux in this bin is only 2.1@xmath25 above the power law fit ; we can not therefore confirm or refute this without higher quality data .",
    "we also derived the value of @xmath26 , the slope of a nominal power - law between 2500  and 2kev . using both the 2500  flux and method to compute @xmath26 described by @xcite , together with our x - ray data , yields @xmath4 .",
    "no short term variability in the x - ray emission was detected in any band , though given the low count rates in both epic detectors this is not unexpected .",
    "previous studies ( @xcite , though see also @xcite ) have found possible evidence for increasing absorption with increasing redshift in qso x - ray spectra , rising from @xmath27@xmath24 at @xmath28 to @xmath29@xmath24 at @xmath30 . it is plausible therefore that the x - ray emission from sdss j1030 + 0524 is attenuated by absorption local to the qso . a modest amount of excess absorption might be expected on the grounds that the ly@xmath8 emission shows some hi absorption @xcite , although if the absorption is due to shocked material accreting onto the host galaxy halo it may not have sufficient heavy element content to produce appreciable x - ray absorption .",
    "we consider three power law plus absorption scenarios ; a model where both @xmath31 and @xmath32 vary , a model where the power law slope is fixed at @xmath33 , and a model where the hydrogen column is fixed at @xmath34@xmath24 . in the case",
    "where @xmath32 is fixed the derived photon index , at @xmath35 , lies within @xmath36 of the photon index derived assuming zero intrinsic absorption . in the two cases where @xmath32 is allowed to vary the best - fit values of @xmath32 , although statistically consistent with zero , have errors too large to allow an accurate hydrogen column to be quoted .",
    "we can however explore the range of acceptable values .",
    "a confidence plot of @xmath31 vs. hydrogen column for the fit in which both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are allowed to vary is shown in figure [ conf ] . based solely on this plot",
    ", we would quote 1@xmath25 ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath38(@xmath39 . a hydrogen column above @xmath40@xmath24",
    "however requires @xmath41 ; this is significantly higher than for any other observed qso ( see e.g. @xcite ) , though such steep slopes are seen in seyferts @xcite .",
    "we therefore quote the ` best fit ' parameters as @xmath3 , with no evidence for excess absorption , but also quote approximate acceptable ranges on these two parameters that are consistent with our data , these are @xmath5 and @xmath38(@xmath42 .",
    "we also explored a wider range of models for the x - ray emission from this qso , though given the relatively low quality of our data we advocate caution in interpreting the following results , and do not present them in table [ specfit ] .",
    "a single thermal bremsstrahlung or blackbody model are both substantially worse fits than any of the power law models , and can be rejected .",
    "a power law plus thermal bremsstrahlung model on the other hand , with or without local absorption , gives a fit of comparable quality to the power law model but requires an x - ray spectral slope of @xmath43 ; this is much flatter than the spectral slopes of other radio - quiet qsos @xcite . while we can not formally discount the possibility of significant thermal x - ray emission , we consider it unlikely .",
    "a power law @xmath44 reflection model gives a marginally worse fit than a single power law model , but not sufficiently so to allow us to formally reject a model including reflection . a power law model with a gaussian line at an observed - frame energy of @xmath45kev",
    "gives a somewhat better fit than a single power law model ( with @xmath46dof@xmath47 ) but this improvement in fit quality is not sufficient to formally prefer this model over the single power law model .",
    "furthermore , the gaussian line properties are not well constrained ; the only constraint is that the line width must be less than 600ev at 3@xmath25 confidence .",
    "overall , we conclude that the x - ray spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524 is best - fit by the single power law model , but we can not determine the presence or otherwise of an fek@xmath8 line , and can not rule out contributions from a thermal bremsstrahlung or reflected component .",
    "finally , we note that the single power law model , whilst statistically acceptable , is not a ` good ' fit to the data , with a null hypothesis probability of @xmath48 .",
    "inspection of the residuals in figure [ spectrum ] shows that this is primarily due to several ` features ' at observed - frame energies @xmath49kev , which are only apparent in the pn spectrum as the mos spectra contain significantly fewer counts .",
    "these features ( which include the possible fek@xmath8 line ) have three possible origins ; they could be intrinsic to the qso , they could arise from foreground ( i.e. @xmath50 ) sources , or they could be residuals from ( for example ) soft proton flares that were not fully removed by the data reduction . of these three reasons",
    "the first two are the most likely , but we can not examine the reasons behind the relative poorness of fit further without higher quality data .",
    "the advent of xmm - newton and chandra have revolutionized x - ray studies of high redshift qsos . currently , detailed x - ray spectral information is available for a large sample of qsos in the redshift range @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we first compare results from these studies to the x - ray properties of sdss j1030 + 0524 .",
    "our best - fit spectral index , at @xmath3 , lies near the middle of the range of values of @xmath31 found for lower redshift radio quiet qsos ( rqqs ) studied with asca @xcite , and is comparable to the values of @xmath31 derived for @xmath52 rqqs from xmm - newton observations @xcite .",
    "the derived rest - frame luminosity ( which has a total @xmath36 uncertainty of @xmath53 ) is approximately 1.5 times and 3 times higher than those derived from chandra observations by @xcite and @xcite respectively ( who assume @xmath54 ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the lower s / n of the chandra data rather than the difference in values of @xmath31 , though variability is also a possibility , and one that our data do not allow us to test for .",
    "our 2 - 10kev luminosity is however comparable to lower redshift rqqs @xcite and marks sdss j1030 + 0524 as being no more than averagely luminous in the x - ray .",
    "our value for the optical - x - ray spectral slope , @xmath4 , is well within the observed range for lower - redshift rqqs , and is statistically identical to the mean value of @xmath26 for @xmath52 rqqs @xcite .",
    "overall therefore , the x - ray luminosity and spectral shape of sdss j1030 + 0524 appear to be indistinguishable from those of rqqs at @xmath51 ( see e.g. fig",
    ". 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "although statistics based on one object are obviously not trustworthy , this result is consistent with the statement that the x - ray properties of optically selected rqqs show no evolution up to @xmath55 .",
    "the only exceptions would be if ( 1 ) the unlikely event that this qso has a very steep intrinsic x - ray spectrum attenuated by heavy absorption , such systems are rare amongst the radio - quiet qso population , and ( 2 ) if the marginal excess flux in the 0.9 - 1.0kev energy range really is fek@xmath8 emission , as this is very rare in qsos generally .",
    "iron k emission from qsos and seyferts is thought to arise either from a cold reflected component from the accretion disk ( for line widths @xmath56ev ) , or from hot gas in a halo ( for line widths @xmath2ev , in this case we might also expect to see significant thermal x - ray emission ) .",
    "the detection of iron k lines in sdss j1030 + 0524 would therefore be especially interesting , but given the quality of our data we do not consider this further .",
    "we can combine this result with previous studies of sdss j1030 + 0524 to establish whether its global properties differ from lower redshift rqqs . as described previously",
    ", this qso does not appear to be significantly magnified by lensing @xcite . together with its measured x - ray luminosity and the spectral shape ,",
    "this constitutes compelling evidence that the mass estimate of @xmath57m@xmath58 for the central black hole derived from the 1450  magnitude @xcite is accurate .",
    "considered together with previous observations ( see  [ intro ] for a review ) then sdss j1030 + 0524 appears to be indistinguishable in _ any _ way from the lower redshift rqq population .",
    "the very existence of such a system only 860myr ( under our cosmology ) after the big bang poses a significant challenge for structure formation theories , and it is this theme we explore in the remainder of this discussion .    to explain the existence of sdss j1030",
    "+ 0524 requires the formation of a @xmath59m@xmath58 black hole and probably also a @xmath60m@xmath58 dm halo ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xmath61m@xmath58 of stars @xcite , all within 860myr .",
    "the formation of a suitably massive halo is readily achieved within the @xmath10cdm framework @xcite , and simulations predict that the mass profiles in the inner 10@xmath62kpc of the most massive halos evolve very little at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "these simulations however only consider the hydrodynamical evolution of the dark matter distribution , and do not consider the astrophysical processes of star and black hole formation .",
    "the formation of the stars and central black hole must therefore be considered separately .",
    "there is evidence , both from observations of old ellipticals at @xmath64 @xcite and from the observed upper bound on the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of stars in ellipticals @xcite , that @xmath10cdm must be capable of forming the stars in a giant elliptical galaxy in less than one gyr .",
    "this requires ( for example ) a ` burst ' of 1000m@xmath58 yr@xmath19 star formation lasting @xmath65100myr .",
    "such high instantaneous star formation rates are inferred to exist in the @xmath66 sub - mm survey sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , and in @xmath67 qsos @xcite , and 100myr is a reasonable upper age limit for starbursts based on observations of local starbursts @xcite . to form",
    "the host galaxy of sdss j1030 + 0524 therefore appears feasible , though this inference is based on observations of lower redshift systems , and we note that the upper limit on the sub - mm flux from sdss j1030 + 0524 @xcite implies an upper limit on the instantaneous star formation rate of @xmath68m@xmath58yr@xmath19 .",
    "the formation of the central black hole is however more difficult to explain .",
    "assuming eddington limited exponential growth , then a @xmath69 black hole can grow from a @xmath70 ` seed ' black hole in @xmath71myr , however the likelihood that the accretion rate is ` fine - tuned ' to the eddington limit for many e - foldings appears small , especially considering the role of feedback from the formation of stars in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore that , unless the accretion rate exceeded the eddington limit for some period of time , or the qso luminosity currently exceeds the eddington limit , accretion onto an initially stellar mass black hole is unlikely to produce the central black hole in sdss j1030 + 0524 within the required timescale , and that a significant fraction of the black hole mass must be built via some other mechanism .",
    "we briefly mention two of a variety of possibilities @xcite here .",
    "the first is that a more massive seed black hole could form as result of collision runaway in dense young star clusters @xcite , which can produce ` intermediate ' mass black holes of several thousand solar masses on rapid timescales .",
    "another possibility is that mergers between @xmath72m@xmath58 black holes created in supernovae of high - mass population iii stars contribute to the build - up of more massive black holes .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite suggest that one @xmath72m@xmath58 star could form rapidly in each @xmath73m@xmath58 @xmath10cdm ` minihalo ' .",
    "population iii stars are not expected to lose much mass in the final stages of stellar evolution and may thus be expected to form black holes of @xmath72m@xmath58 in less than 1myr . a fraction of these black holes are predicted to be driven to the inner regions of larger galaxies by ongoing mergers @xcite . the space density and the further fate of these black holes is uncertain , but it is at least plausible that mergers between these black holes first form ` intermediate ' mass black holes which then contribute to the build - up of the @xmath59m@xmath58 black holes in @xmath11 qsos by a mixture of further merging and accretion @xcite .    in summary",
    ", there is observational and theoretical evidence that the host halo , stellar mass , and central black hole required to make a fully formed qso can form in less than a gyr .",
    "the existence however of a radio quiet qso at @xmath55 that appears indistinguishable from other rqqs at lower redshifts is still surprising , and the most pressing , and as yet unanswered question is whether the formation of the halo , stars , and central black hole in an object such as sdss j1030 + 0524 can be accomplished _ together _ in less than a gyr in the @xmath10cdm framework .",
