    "our understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has improved tremendously in the last ten years .",
    "observations have firmly established that grbs and their afterglows arise from highly relativistic ( taylor et al 2004 ) , collimated outflows ( frail et al 2001 , panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) . at least a few long - duration grbs are associated with the collapse of massive stars ( galama et al 1998 , della valle et al 2003 , hjorth et al 2003 , malesani et al 2004 ) , but less than a few percent of supernovae of type ib / c give rise to grbs ( soderberg et al 2004 ) .",
    "a fraction of short - duration grbs are associated with old stellar populations ( nakar 2007 ) .    among the fundamental questions that remain unanswered",
    "is the generation of @xmath3-rays and the composition of the relativistic jet ( baryonic , e@xmath4 and/or magnetic ) .",
    "the simultaneous monitoring of the optical and @xmath3-ray emissions of grb 080319b can provide insight into the mechanism for @xmath3-ray generation , as described in the next section .",
    "studies of the multiwavelength prompt emission are still incipient because of the rarity of a good temporal coverage of the optical counterpart .",
    "so far , the prompt optical emission was observed @xmath5 to be decoupled from that at @xmath3-rays ( grb 990123  akerlof et al 1999 ) , @xmath6 to contain a fluctuating component that tracks the burst and a smooth one peaking after the burst ( grb 050820a  vestrand et al 2006 ) , or @xmath7 to fluctuate in phase with the burst ( grb 041219a  vestrand et al 2005 ) .",
    "grb 080319b is of the last type .",
    "grb 080319b was the brightest burst detected by swift .",
    "it was also seen by the konus satellite , which measured its fluence in the 20 kev  7 mev band , @xmath8 erg @xmath9 , corresponding to and isotropic energy release of @xmath10 erg ( golenetskii et al 2008 ) , for the burst redshift @xmath11 ( vreeswijk et al 2008 , cucchiara & fox 2008 ) .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum during the burst peaked at 650 kev .",
    "the konus spectrum was @xmath12 below its peak at 650 kev and @xmath13 above it .    the peak optical flux during the burst was @xmath14 mag ( karpov et al 2008 ) , detectable with unaided eye for about 30 s under appropriate conditions . the optical and the gamma - ray light - curves of grb 080319b shown in figure [ prompt ]",
    "are mildly correlated , suggesting that both radiations originated from the same source .",
    "the optical - gamma - ray correlation function for the entire prompt emission has a maximum at lags between 0s and 5s , that being mostly the result of the contemporaneous rise at 0 - 18 s and fall at 43 - 60 s. for the middle part of prompt emission , the optical - gamma - ray correlation function still has a peak at lags between -1s to 3s , but is less prominent",
    ".    the time - lag between the ( grb ) emission produced in ( say ) internal shocks and the ( optical ) emission released by the blast - wave caused by the ejecta interaction with the ambient medium can be arbitrarily small , thus the optical and @xmath3-ray fluctuations could be correlated ( as seen for grb 080319b ) even though they arise from different sources .",
    "however , the short duration @xmath15 of the optical pulses ( with @xmath16 ) and the lack of an increasing optical pulse duration throughout the burst ( instead , a decrease is apparent ) , as expected for an increasing source radius , argue against an origin of the optical counterpart in the external shock ( either the reverse - shock crossing the ejecta or the forward - shock propagating in the circumburst medium ) .",
    "this makes it more likely that the two prompt emissions are , in fact , arising from same source .",
    "the extrapolation of the gamma - ray spectrum ( which peaks at 650 kev and has a peak flux of about 7 mjy ) to the optical band under - predicts the observed optical counterpart flux ( which is around 20 jy ) by almost 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "this indicates that , although from same source , the optical and gamma - ray radiation processes are different .",
    "a natural possibility is that optical photons were generated via the synchrotron emission and gamma - rays via inverse - compton scatterings of that synchrotron emission ( i.e. _ synchrotron self - compton _ mechanism )",
    ".    the peak energy of the synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath17 ) should be below optical , to account for the optical spectrum of @xmath18 ( woniak et al 2008 ) : measured by raptor after 80 s. we parameterize the synchrotron peak photon energy as @xmath19ev ( @xmath20 ) , above which the optical counterpart spectrum has a spectral index @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) .",
    "the measured peak energy of the @xmath3-ray burst spectrum , which is the inverse - compton scattering of synchrotron photons , implies that the radiating electrons have a random lorentz factor @xmath23 , where the factor 5 accounts for the scattering by a population of electrons with a power - law distribution with energy above @xmath24 .",
    "the second inverse - compton scattering component should peak at @xmath25 gev and its fluence should be larger than that of the gamma - rays by a factor equal to the gamma - ray to optical fluence ratio : @xmath26 ( this ratio is the `` compton parameter '' ) . hence , the fluence of the @xmath27 gev emission accompanying grb 080319b should have been @xmath28 erg @xmath9 ; the glast / lat instrument would collect thousands photons at 0.1100 gev during a burst as bright as grb 080319b .    for the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray output of grb 080319b of @xmath29 erg ,",
    "the compton parameter above implies a gev output of @xmath30 erg . the energy release is smaller if the second inverse - compton scattering is in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "the total energy release is reduced further by a few orders of magnitude if the fireball is tightly collimated ( i.e. the explosion energy is released in a narrow jet ) .",
    "these reduction factors are estimated below .",
    "as the peak of the synchrotron spectrum is at @xmath31 hz , where @xmath32 is the source s magnetic field and @xmath33 its bulk lorentz factor , the inferred random lorentz factor @xmath24 of the radiating electrons and the peak frequency of the synchrotron spectrum imply that @xmath34 gauss . for a burst redshift @xmath35 ,",
    "the peak flux of the synchrotron emission is @xmath36 jy , where @xmath37 is the number of radiating electrons , thus observed synchrotron optical peak flux of @xmath38 jy requires that @xmath39 .",
    "the optical thickness of the source to thomson scattering ( @xmath40 ) is the ratio of the inverse - compton peak flux ( at 650 kev ) and the synchrotron peak flux : @xmath41 . using that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the electron cross - section for thomson scattering",
    ", it follows that the grb source radius is @xmath44 cm .",
    "this distance is a factor @xmath45 larger than that expected ( eg .",
    "piran 2005 ) for internal shocks .",
    "the very steep decline of gamma - ray and optical flux at the end of the burst suggests that the source turned - off quickly .",
    "the flux decline can not be faster than the limit provided by the photons emitted from source regions outside the @xmath46 opening area moving toward the observer .",
    "this  large - angle \" emission arising from the fluid moving at an angle larger than @xmath46 yields a flux decay @xmath47 ( fenimore & sumner 1997 , kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "since the burst emission has @xmath48 in the 15150 kev bat window ( cummings et al 2008 ) , the large - angle emission should decay as @xmath49 , i.e. much slower than the fall - off displayed by the burst emission at 5055 s ( figure [ aglow ] ) .",
    "the observed decay of the burst tail can be reconciled with the upper limit set by the large - angle emission if the last grb pulse is timed not since the burst trigger ( e.g. fan & wei 2005 ) but since a reference time @xmath50 after it , when the relativistic ejecta producing the last grb pulse must have been released .",
    "this means that the timescale of the grb pulse decay is @xmath51 s. taking into account that @xmath52 , the inferred burst radius implies a source lorentz factor @xmath53 .",
    "then , from @xmath54 g , we find that the magnetic field in the grb source is @xmath55 g.    the grb source radius can be used to constrain the location of the synchrotron peak frequency ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the lack of a progressive lengthening of the burst pulse throughout the burst indicates that the grb source is not decelerating .",
    "the radius at which the ejecta are decelerated by their interaction with the wind expelled by the wolf - rayet progenitor is @xmath56 cm , provided that the kinetic energy of the ejecta is similar to the radiation output .",
    "the condition @xmath57 leads to @xmath58 . at the same time , at the end of the burst , the peak of the synchrotron spectrum can not be well above 1 ev ( i.e. @xmath59 ) because that would bring the synchrotron self - absorption frequency above the optical and yield a constant optical flux from the large - angle emission , which is inconsistent with observations of a decaying optical flux after the burst end .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , @xmath60 , implying that the time averaged optical spectrum during the burst should have been rather flat .    for the inferred @xmath24 and @xmath33",
    ", the second inverse - compton scattering occurs just above the klein - nishina limit , where the electron scattering cross - section is @xmath61 .",
    "therefore the twice - scattered photon takes all the electron energy , the peak energy of the 2nd inverse - compton component being at @xmath62 gev and the compton parameter for the 2nd scattering being @xmath63   \\sim 10 $ ] ( i.e. 10 times smaller than for the first scattering ) .",
    "thus , the isotropic - equivalent total radiation output of grb 080319b was @xmath64 erg .",
    "from the inferred @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath65 ( for first and second scattering ) , it can be shown that the cooling electron lorentz factor @xmath66 , thus @xmath67 and the grb electrons are fast - cooling ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , since the grb spectrum does not exhibit a @xmath68 spectrum below its peak , as expected for radiatively - cooling electrons , a re - acceleration process must be active during the burst .",
    "second , at the end of burst , when electrons are no longer accelerated , the peak energy of the inverse - compton spectrum falls fast below the bat window and the emission from the @xmath46 region moving toward the observer decreases on a timescale shorter than @xmath15 , allowing the large - angle emission to become dominant ( i.e. initial assumption that the grb tail is the large - angle emission is self - consistent ) .",
    "if the grb ejecta were baryonic with one proton per electron , then the energy stored in protons were larger by that of electrons by a factor of at least @xmath69 , implying that the total grb outflow energy is at least 5 times larger than the radiated energy .",
    "thus the total isotropic - equivalent energy release in this grb explosion must have been @xmath70 erg .      although the synchrotron self - compton model is a _",
    "natural _ interpretation of the optical and gamma - ray prompt emission from grb 080319b , it suffers from a few , possibly serious , problems .",
    "one of the problems is the incompatibility between the observed and expected gamma - ray spectrum . in the synchrotron - self compton model , the synchrotron ( optical ) and inverse - compton ( gamma - rays ) spectra",
    "are closely related .",
    "the model parameters derived above lead to an upscattered self - absorbed photon energy of @xmath45 kev , below which the inverse - compton spectrum should be @xmath71 ( panaitescu & mszros 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , golenetskii et al ( 2008 ) measure for grb 080319b a softer @xmath72 gamma - ray spectrum down to 20 kev .",
    "a similar inconsistency between the self - compton model and gamma - ray observations is encountered for grb 990123 , which we ( panaitescu & kumar 2007 ) suggested that could be explained if the magnetic field decays ( rossi & rees 2003 ) on a length - scale much larger than the plasma skin depth .",
    "furthermore , in the large - angle emission interpretation of the early , steep optical decay (  [ lae ] ) , the optical spectral slope @xmath73 measured by woniak et al ( 2008 ) during that decay is just the slope above the peak of the synchrotron spectrum of the prompt emission .",
    "however , that is inconsistent with the spectral slope of the inverse - compton emission above the grb spectral peak , which golenetskii et al ( 2008 ) report to be much softer , @xmath74 . the possible solution to this problem",
    "is that the early optical afterglow emission of grb 080319b , which we identify with the large - angle emission released during the burst , is dominated by that from a single pulse whose spectrum is harder above its spectral peak than that of the burst - averaged gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "taking onto account that the decay of the large - angle emission from a pulse lasting @xmath15 , peaking at @xmath75 , and of peak flux @xmath76 , is @xmath77^{-2-\\beta_o}$ ] , it seems plausible that the large - angle emission is dominated by the pulse with the hardest spectral slope @xmath21 .",
    "another potential problem for the synchrotron self - compton interpretation of grb 080319b s prompt emission is that the gamma - ray light - curve exhibits a higher variability than the optical counterpart , as one would expect the inverse - compton gamma - ray emission to have less fluctuations than the synchrotron seed photon field .",
    "we note that the rise of the optical counterpart emission lagging that of the gamma - rays could be due to the optical band being below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency at early times .",
    "in this case , the adiabatic cooling of ejecta electrons leads to a steep rise ( @xmath78 ) , consistent with that displayed by the optical emission at 815 s. at the other end , the optical counterpart emission turned - off before the gamma - rays .",
    "that the last three grb pulses are not accompanied by optical emission may be due to that their synchrotron spectrum peaked sufficiently below the optical .",
    "after the burst , the optical emission has a spectral slope @xmath80 and displays a steep decay , @xmath81 up to 1 ks , as shown in figure [ early ] , where the contribution of the power - law decaying emission after 1 ks , @xmath82 , was subtracted from the earlier optical flux . assuming that the burst ejecta is in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium shocked by the forward shock , whose structure is described by the blandford - mckee solution , we find that the steepest decay for the synchrotron emission from the ejecta electrons , after they have been energized by the reverse - shock ( i.e. as they cool adiabatically ) , is obtained for a wind - like medium and an ejecta shell thickness increasing as @xmath83 , with @xmath84 the shock radius and @xmath85 its lorentz factor .",
    "that decay , @xmath86 ( see equation 55 of panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) is too slow to account for the decay measured for grb afterglow 080319b at 1001000 s ( the results of sari & piran 1999 and kobayashi & sari 2000 for the reverse - shock emission give a steeper decay , up to @xmath87 , which is still too slow to account for the observed @xmath81 ) .    instead",
    ", the optical light - curve decline is consistent with the large - angle emission model , for which @xmath88 is expected .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the optical afterglow emission between 50 s and 1 ks arises from the same source that produced @xmath3-ray photons .      the slower decay of the optical flux observed after 1 ks , @xmath89 ( figure [ aglow ] ) , is most naturally attributed to the emission from the forward - shock driven into the ambient medium ( e.g. paczyski & rhoads 1993 , mszros & rees 1997 ) by the burst ejecta overtaking the large - angle burst emission . the optical flux decay ( @xmath90 ) and spectral slope @xmath91 at 90 ks",
    "( bloom et al 2008 ) satisfy @xmath92 , which is consistent only with a circumburst medium density of @xmath93 radial structure and cooling frequency of the forward - shock synchrotron spectrum above optical ( for which @xmath94 is expected  chevalier & li 1999 ) . a homogeneous circumburst medium , for which @xmath95 or -0.5 ( depending on the location of the cooling break ) is inconsistent with the observations at the 4@xmath96 level .",
    "the x - ray light - curve should exhibit the same decay as the optical if the cooling break frequency is not between optical and x - ray or , owing to a wind - like medium , a slower one with decay index @xmath97 if the cooling frequency is between these domains .",
    "the former could be the case for the early ( before 1 ks ) x - ray light - curve , whose decay is compatible with that seen in the optical after 1 ks , but neither expectation is satisfied by the x - ray and optical decays after 1 ks , for which @xmath98 . the same inconsistency with the standard blast - wave model expectations is also illustrated in the lower panel of figure [ aglow ] , which shows that , if the optical and x - ray afterglow emissions were attributed to the same spectral component , then the cooling break would have to exhibit an non - monotonic evolution incompatible with the blast - wave model , in general , and with the @xmath99 evolution expected for wind medium , in particular .",
    "the non - monotonic evolution of the cooling break shown in figure [ aglow ] suggests a departure from the basic assumptions of the standard blast - wave model , such as a non - monotonically evolving magnetic field energy parameter ( on which the cooling frequency has the strongest dependence ) . alternately , the optical and x - ray afterglow emissions may have ( somewhat ) different origins .",
    "for instance , the optical flux , which exhibits a single power - law decay after 1 ks , could be attributed to the synchrotron emission from the forward shock , while the x - ray flux , which displays 5 power - law segments , could arise from reprocessing of the forward - shock emission by scattering off a lagged part of the relativistic outflow ( panaitescu 2008 ) .    for grb ejecta collimated into a jet of half - angle @xmath100 ,",
    "the afterglow light - curve should exhibit a steepening to a decay faster than @xmath101 when the jet edge becomes visible to the observer .",
    "using the arrival time of photons emitted at angle @xmath46 and for a circumburst medium of density typical for galactic wolf - rayet stars , the jet - break time is @xmath102 d. since the optical light - curve of grb 080319b afterglows does not exhibit a jet - break during the first 10 days ( figure [ aglow ] ) , the jet opening is @xmath103 deg .",
    "therefore , the collimation - corrected kinetic energy of the grb outflow is @xmath104 erg .",
    "the modest correlation between the optical and gamma - ray light - curves of grb 080319b suggests that these emissions may be from the same source . that the prompt optical flux lies well above the extrapolation of the burst spectrum to optical indicates that the two emissions arose from different radiation processes : optical emission was generated through synchrotron process and @xmath3-rays were due to inverse - compton scattering of the synchrotron photons . as shown by ( kumar & mcmahon 2008 )",
    ", a bright optical emission accompanying @xmath3-rays is a generic prediction of the synchrotron self - compton model for grbs .",
    "however , some features of the gamma - ray data for grb 080319b are not accounted for by that model , as discussed in  [ lim ] .",
    "synchrotron self - compton emission may have also been observed during grb 990123 ( panaitescu & kumar 2007 ) . for the bright optical counterpart of grb 080319b",
    ", we find that the spectrum of the synchrotron prompt emission must have peaked in the optical , while for grb 990123 that peak was slightly above optical , which can explain ( at least in part ) why these optical counterparts were so bright .    within the synchrotron self - compton model for the prompt emission and without any assumption about the dissipation mechanism , we have shown that the @xmath3-ray and optical measurements of grb 080319b imply a source radius of @xmath0 cm , moving at lorentz factor 500 .",
    "the energy of the 2nd inverse - compton scattering , which should have peaked at @xmath105 gev , must have been 10 times larger than that of the 1st inverse - compton component at sub - mev energies . with the lower limit on the half - angle of the grb outflow set by the lack of an afterglow optical light - curve break until 10 d , and assuming a baryonic , shock - heated @xmath3-ray source",
    ", we estimate that the beaming - corrected kinetic energy of outflow powering grb 080319b was higher than @xmath2 erg ( twice larger for a double - sided jet ) , which provides an important constraint for the collapsar model ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 , woosley & bloom 2006 ) for long bursts .",
    "we find that the optical light - curve decay at 0.11 ks is too fast to be attributed to the external reverse - shock propagating into the grb ejecta . instead",
    ", the early optical decay and spectral slope are consistent with the large - angle emission released during the burst and arriving at observer later , due to the spherical curvature of the emitting surface .",
    "the decay of the late - time ( @xmath106 ks ) optical afterglow flux is consistent with an origin in the forward - shock energizing a wind - like circumburst medium , a homogeneous medium being `` ruled out '' at 4@xmath96 .",
    "however , if the optical and x - ray afterglow fluxes arose from same mechanism , an unusual evolution of the cooling frequency would be required , which may be indicative of evolving blast - wave microphysical parameters .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray afterglow emission may be affected by reprocessing of the optical forward - shock photons through ( bulk and , possibly , inverse - compton ) scattering by a relativistic , pair - rich outflow located behind the forward shock . in this model , the scattering outflow results from continued accretion onto the central black - hole , if such an accretion can be maintained for source - frame timescales comparable to the observer - frame duration of the x - ray afterglow .",
