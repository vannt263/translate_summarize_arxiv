    "geometric phase has not been noticed for a long time until pancharatnam s study @xcite and berry s discovery @xcite .",
    "shortly , simon gave a geometric interpretation of this kind of phase in the language of differential geometry and fibre bundles @xcite .",
    "since then there was a keen interest in holonomy effect in quantum theory , which leads to many extensions of the geometric phase , including the geometric phase acquired in a non - adiabatic and cyclic evolution by aharonov and anandan @xcite , in a non - adiabatic and non - cyclic evolution by samel and bhandari @xcite and in a non - adiabatic , non - cyclic and non - unitary evolution by mukunda @xcite .",
    "all those investigations were focused on pure state . for a practical quantum system , however , its state would be mixed due to the unavoidable coupling to its environment .",
    "this motivates the study on the geometric phase for mixed states@xcite , which was defined by @xcite ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of the density matrix , respectively . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use this definition to study the geometric phase .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is complicated to exactly describe the dynamics of open systems due to the huge number of variables in an environment .",
    "in order to simplify the description , one could make some approximations such as the weakly coupling and the markovian approximation . under these approximations",
    ", we can obtain a markovian master equation that describes the dynamics of the open system without memory of its history .",
    "however , many systems exhibit strong non - markovian effect and can not be described by the markovian master equation .",
    "it is then interesting to study the geometric phase in a non - markovian dynamics , and establish the relation between the geometric phase and the non - markovianity of the dynamics .",
    "the non - markovianity may be defined in many ways @xcite , for instance , in ref.@xcite the authors proposed a scheme to quantify the degree of the non - markovianity based on the trace distance of two quantum states@xcite , and in ref.@xcite the non - markovianity was measured by exploiting the specific traits of quantum correlations .",
    "the effects of non - markovianity on geometric phase has been considered by several works , e.g. refs.@xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will establish a relation between the geometric phase and the information flows .",
    "we divide the information flow into two types , i.e. , the information flow from the open system into the environment @xmath3 ( call forward information flow ) and the information flow back from the environment to the open system @xmath4 ( call backward information flow ) .",
    "the backward information flow @xmath4 in fact is a modified measure of non - markovianity given by breuer and his co - workers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we present a definition for the information flow based on the trace distance , then we establish the relation between the information flow and the geometric phase for pure initial states .",
    "the case of mixed initial states is considered in sec.iii , where the geometric phase and the information flow are calculated numerically .",
    "finally , we present conclusion and discussions in sec.iv .",
    "here we first recall the measure for non - markovianity defined by breuer@xcite .",
    "this definition is based on the so - called trace distance between two states @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "for a two - level system , this trace distance is equal to one half of the ordinary euclidean distance between the two states on the bloch sphere , i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bloch vector for state @xmath11 .",
    "the change rate of the trace distance can be represented as @xmath12when @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 approach to each other in the dynamics and this can be understood as information flow from the system to the environment ; when @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is away from each other in the time evolution , and this can be interpreted as information flow back to the system , which is treated as a typical character of the non - markovianity . as shown in refs.@xcite and @xcite , one can define a measure of non - markovianity @xmath17 for a quantum process @xmath18 by maximizing over all initial states @xmath19 of total gain of the trace distance , namely , @xmath20the measure of non - markovianity only characterizes the gain of the trace distance in the dynamics . to describe the loss and gain of the trance distance uniformly , we extend the concept of information flow in the following .",
    "in fact , one of the information flows defined below is a modified measure of non - markovianity in eq.([measuren1 ] ) . we choose a steady state as @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ distance ] ) and call it standard state .",
    "this choice makes the maximization easy , however , it can not measure all non - markovian dynamics .",
    "fortunately , this simplified measure of non - markovianity is in agreement with the measure given in @xcite in our case .",
    "now we define @xmath3 and @xmath4 to measure the information gain and lose for a given initial state @xmath21 in the dynamics @xmath18",
    ". we will refer this information gain and loss uniformly as formation flows .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23obviously , the above two measures satisfy , @xmath24the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is as follows .",
    "@xmath26 is the maximum information flow back to the system in the dynamics .",
    "hence it does not depend on the initial condition .",
    "however @xmath27 is the information flow back to system with respect to the standard state @xmath28 in the interval @xmath29 ( assumed that a steady state for quantum process @xmath18 exists , and the standard state @xmath28 is exactly the steady state as before ) .",
    "this simplification is true in the situation considered in this paper , i.e. , a two - level system coupling to vacuum electromagnetic fields at zero temperature with standard state @xmath6 in the bloch sphere representation as @xmath30 .    with these definition and notations",
    ", we will discuss the relationship between the geometric phase and the information flows between the open system and its environment .",
    "consider a two - level system coupled to its environment at zero temperature .",
    "the general form of the density matrix can be expressed as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the pauli matrices , and @xmath33 is the bloch vector . for pure initial states @xmath34 , while for mixed initial states @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to obtain the instantaneous eigenvalues of the above density matrix @xmath36 as , @xmath37it is obvious that for the pure initial states , the eigenvalue @xmath38 , which means that the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath39 gives no contribution to the geometric phase .",
    "this simplifies our calculation and helps us to obtain an analytic result for the geometric phase .",
    "the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues in eq.([epsilon ] ) can be written as , @xmath40now substitute eq.([epsilon ] ) and eq.([eigenstate ] ) into the eq.([tonggp ] ) with an assumption that @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants , this is reasonable for different kinds of master equation @xcite ) , the geometric phase with pure initial states ( their bloch vector is @xmath44 ) can be obtained as @xmath45where we set @xmath46 @xmath47 , i.e. , a multiple of the quasi - period @xmath48 .",
    "next , we establish the relationship between the geometric phase and the information flows @xmath49 and @xmath25 . keeping the relationship eq.([rmeasuren ] ) between the @xmath25 and @xmath49 in mind",
    ", we obtain the geometric phase acquired by the system ,    @xmath50 ^ 2{-}2r_z(t){-}1}}]\\,dt .\\label{dgeometricalphase}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the z - component of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is shown that when the system is closed , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is initial polar angle on the bloch sphere , and setting @xmath57 , eq.([dgeometricalphase ] ) reduced to the well - known form , @xmath58 , that is the geometric phase acquired by a two - level quantum system in a rotating magnetic field . for a markovian process",
    ", @xmath59 is always zero and @xmath49 increases with time until it approaches @xmath60 . in this case , the geometric phase is only influenced by the information flow to the environment .",
    "when we consider the non - markovian effects , the situation is more complicated , and the information flow @xmath25 back to the open system has a link to the geometric phase given by eq.([dgeometricalphase ] ) .",
    "we will discuss it numerically in sec.iii .",
    "in this section , we will study the geometric phase of a two - level system with mixed initial states . because it is difficult to get an analytical result like eq.([dgeometricalphase ] ) for the information flows and the geometric phase , we here numerically and perturbatively establish a relation between the geometric phase and the information flow .",
    "the perturbation is carried out to the first order in the coupling constant , while the numerical results are for a wide range of coupling constants .",
    "two types of master equation , the time - local master equation and the memory kernel master equation with exponential memory , will be considered .",
    "let us consider a two - level system interacting with a vacuum field at zero temperature whose spectral density is lorentzian @xcite , @xmath61here @xmath62 is the coupling constant between the system and the environment , @xmath42 is the atomic transition frequency which is of the time scale @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the spectral width of the coupling that is connected to the environment correlation time , @xmath65 .",
    "the dynamics of this system is governed by the following master equation ( namely the time - local master equation ) @xcite , @xmath66 + \\gamma(t)[2\\sigma_-\\rho(t)\\sigma_+-\\sigma_+\\sigma_-\\rho(t)-\\rho(t)\\sigma_+\\sigma_-],\\label{timelocal}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath67 are the pauli operators and the parameters @xmath68 , & \\gamma(t)=-\\re[\\frac{\\dot    c(t)}{c(t ) } ] , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\]]play the role of lamb shift and decay rate for the system , respectively . here",

    "we note that the rate @xmath72 indicates the strength of the non - markovianity . with @xmath73 ,",
    "the dynamics is called time - dependent markovian , while for @xmath74 the dynamics is non - markovian . here",

    "we can see from fig.[w01phase1 ] that the geometric phase increases monotonically with the parameter @xmath110 . in this case , the coupling strength @xmath62 is small enough so that there is no information flowing back into the system in a quasi - period . for pure initial states ,",
    "i.e. @xmath108 , comparing fig.[w01phase1 ] with fig.[w01measure1 ] , we find that the larger the geometric phase is , the more information flow to the environment , this is confirmed by eq.([dgeometricalphase ] ) .",
    "because @xmath121 is always zero in a quasi - period , the geometric phase mainly depends on @xmath122 .     as a function of the parameter @xmath110 with different @xmath111 . here the coupling strength @xmath116 and @xmath113 .",

    "we only focus on the information flow @xmath4 , because it characterizes the non - markovianity of the open system and describe the backward information flow .    comparing fig.[w1measure1 ] with fig.[w1phase1 ] , we may find that , when the information flows back to the system , the geometric phase decreases with the increase of @xmath121 and , in the region of @xmath126 , the behavior of the geometric phase is similar with the case in the weak coupling limit .",
    "this indicates the backward information flow ( i.e. , information flow back to the open system ) affects the geometric phase acquired by the open system .",
    "this phenomena can be understood as follows : for this time - local master equation , when the information flows back to the system , the bloch vector moves toward to the north pole of the sphere , then the geometrical phase which is interpreted as the solid angle in bloch sphere decreases .     as a function of @xmath110 with different @xmath111 . here",

    "the initial states of the open system are the same as in fig.[w01phase1 ] . ]",
    "when @xmath62 is very large , the system will drop into steady state after time @xmath124 . in this case , by comparing the geometric phase @xmath118 and the information flow @xmath4 , we can see that , when @xmath126 ( as shown in fig.[w10measure1 ] ) , the behavior of the geometric phase ( as shown in fig.[w10phase1 ] ) is very similar to the case of @xmath112 and @xmath116 with @xmath126 . with the increase of @xmath110 ,",
    "the information flow back into the open system and the geometric phase decreases with @xmath110 , this is very similar to the case when @xmath116 in the region of @xmath125 .",
    "based on these observations , we conclude that for a dynamics described by the time local master equation , if the geometrical phase is inversely proportional to @xmath110 , the dynamics must be non - markovian . in other words , the non - markovianity can be reflected in the geometrical phase to a certain extent .",
    "this conclusion are both valid for pure and mixed initial states .",
    "it is seemingly that the point ( in the @xmath110 axis ) where the geometric phase arrives its extremum is exactly the point where @xmath127 begin to increase ( in the following we will call it as the critical point ) , however , by carefully examination , we find that this is not the case . according to eq.([dgeometricalphase ] ) and the definition of trace distance , we can clarify that the critical point is the very point where the integrand of the geometric phase reaches its minimum ( a detail of proof can be found in the appendix ) .",
    "moreover , the integrand of the geometrical phase behaves similarly with the information flow @xmath25 .     and ( b ) the geometric phase @xmath118 as a function of @xmath110 and the initial polar angle @xmath128 ( in units of @xmath120 ) .",
    "here the coupling strength is @xmath117 and @xmath113 .",
    "the initial states of the open system are chosen as @xmath129 and @xmath130 . ]    the information flow @xmath127 and the geometric phase @xmath118 as a function of @xmath128 and @xmath110 are plotted in fig.[tc ] . when @xmath131 , it can be seen from the figure that the more the information flows back , the smaller the geometric phase ; in the region of @xmath97 , no matter how to choose the initial azimuthal angle @xmath128 , the geometric phase increase with @xmath110 , which is exactly the finding of our analytical analysis .",
    "when @xmath132 , both @xmath133 and @xmath118 reach its extremum , in this case , the geometric phase do not change with @xmath110 and @xmath134 , but the information flow changes indeed .",
    "this can be understood as follow : when @xmath132 , @xmath135 , the initial density matrix is diagonal , i.e. @xmath136 , with this diagonal density matrix , the geometric phase is always equal to @xmath137 and @xmath133 changes with @xmath110 since the information exchange between the system and the environment varies with @xmath110 .",
    "the situation remains unchanged for the cases where @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore we find that , although @xmath134 for both @xmath132 and @xmath139 , the information flows @xmath127 are completely different .",
    "this can be explained as the difference in the initial states , which are @xmath136 for @xmath132 and @xmath140 for @xmath139 . by the definition of the geometric phase , it depends on the spectrum of the density matrix , which are the same for the initial states , leading to the same geometric phase acquired in the dynamics .",
    "but the information flow @xmath127 for @xmath139 is larger than that for @xmath132 , this is because the information flow was defined as the distance between the actual state and the standard state of the open system , which are different for the initial states .",
    "now we consider the geometric phase of an open two - level system governed by the memory kernel master equation with exponential memory . here",
    ", we just apply this model to calculate the geometric phase but do not discuss the positivity of the master equation in detail .    in the interaction picture , the integro - differential master equation with memory kernel can be expressed as @xmath141where @xmath142 is liouvillian superoperator which takes the form @xmath143 and @xmath144 is the dissipation rate , @xmath145 represents the memory effect called shabani - lidar memory kernel@xcite @xmath146 we call @xmath147 the memory time .",

    "in summary , we have discussed the information flows and the geometric phase in different non - markovian process . for an open two - level system with pure initial states , an analytic relation between",

    "we find that , in both cases , the information flows influence the geometric phase directly , a relation between the geometric phase and information flow is numerically established .",
    "an understanding for the observation is provided .",
    "the forward and backward information flow are by definition different , but they complementarily describe the information exchange between the environment and the system . the backward information flow can be used to describe the non - markovianity of the open system , while the forward information flow was connected with the coherence loss .",
    "neither forward information flow nor backward information flow can be measured directly , indicating that the measure of non - markovianity defined in this way can not be directly observed in experiment . however , mixed state geometric phases are measurable and the feature caused by it has been observed@xcite .",
    "this motivates the establishment of the connection between the geometric phase and the information flow .",
    "indeed , the finding of this paper suggests that the geometric phase can reflect the non - markovianity and then can serve as a measure of non - markovianity for open systems .",

    "<S> geometric phases and information flows of a two - level system coupled to its environment are calculated and analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the information flow is defined as a cumulant of changes in trace distance between two quantum states , which is similar to the measure for non - markovianity given by breuer . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an analytic relation between the geometric phase and the information flow for pure initial states , and a numerical result for mixed initial states . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric phase behaves differently depending on whether there are information flows back to the two - level system from its environment . </S>"
