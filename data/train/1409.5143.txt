    "the study of these systems was only of academic interest , 2d solids being considered unstable structures never observed experimentally .",
    "things changed in 2004 , when graphene was finally isolated @xcite .",
    "this discover paved the way to the study of this astonishing carbon allotrope constituted by a mono - layer of ions forming an honeycomb lattice in which charge carriers manifest peculiar transport properties @xcite . in particular conduction and",
    "valence bands touch in isolated points of @xmath2-space : the dirac points . around them",
    "the energy - momentum dispersion relation is conical and a dirac - like equation for massless fermions replaces schrdinger s one to describe the quantum motion of the carriers .",

    "furthermore relativistic effects , in general inversely proportional to the speed of light , would be enhanced in graphene : the role of @xmath3 is here played by the group velocity @xmath4 of the particles around the cone and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the growing attention for graphene and others mono - layer materials translates in an increasing interest toward their quantum simulators , so that many artificial prototypes of 2d lattices have been proposed and realized in the past years ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . in the present work we introduce a general , highly controllable model for the realization of artificial bi - dimensional lattices , based on the use of two cold - atomic species . in our system",
    "a 2d matter wave , made of @xmath1 atoms , interacts with point - like scatterers of a second atomic species , denoted by @xmath0 , independently trapped around the nodes of a 2d optical lattice . a schematic representation of our model is presented in fig .",

    "we limit our investigations to one - body physics in the matter wave , i.e. we assume @xmath1 atoms to be non - interacting with themselves , situation attainable by using polarized fermions or bosons at zero scattering length .",

    "other techniques are also available to probe @xcite and manipulate @xcite at single - site and single - atom level the scatterers arrangement .",
    "this model has been recently proposed to study the effects of disorder in 1d @xcite , 2d and 3d systems @xcite , and it has the advantage to show a one - to - one correspondence with the bi - dimensional lattices that can mimic : the @xmath1 atoms of the matter wave play the role of the electronic cloud while the deeply trapped @xmath0 ones represent the crystalline structure . from now on we will refer to our system as atomic artificial crystal ( aac ) , since the periodic potential felt by the matter wave is generated by other atoms and not by a sub - standing optical potential .",

    "we start by introducing the theoretical model in sec .",
    "[ sectheoreticalmodel ] , briefly discussing the problem of scattering in reduced _ and _ mixed dimensions ( sec .",

    "are analyzed in function of the @xmath9 interaction strength .",

    "we finally present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ secconclusions ] .",
    "a remarkable feature of cold - atomic systems is the possibility to use experimentally controllable parameters as knobs to tune the interatomic scattering lengths , for example by means of feshbach or dipolar - induced resonances @xcite . when the interacting particles are subject to a trapping potential , this can , in turn , play a role leading to confinement - induced resonances @xcite .",
    "if the trapping is sufficiently strong the dimensionality of the system can be reduced : it has been proved , for instance , that a 3d system subject to a strong axial confinement ( quasi-2d ) can be mapped into a strictly-2d one by introducing an effective 2d scattering length , the latter depending on the free 3d interaction and on the trapping parameters @xcite .",
    "another related subject is the study of scattering processes involving differently - trapped atoms , in this cases we talk about scattering in mixed dimensions .",

    "the system is equivalent to a strictly bi - dimensional one ( bottom panel ) in which the @xmath0 atom constitutes a fixed point - like scatterer and the scattering process is ruled only by an effective 2d scattering length @xmath11 @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the case of the aac the building - block of any analysis is the 2-body low - energy scattering process between an @xmath1 atom of mass @xmath12 , harmonically trapped on a plane , and a @xmath0 one of mass @xmath13 , trapped around a node of an optical lattice , process schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ figscattering ] .",
    "it can be shown that , by providing a proper effective 2d scattering length @xmath11 , the system is mapped into a strictly 2d space in which the @xmath0 atom is now a fixed point - like scatterer .",
    "the effective parameter @xmath11 , which takes also into account the quantum motion of the @xmath0 atom in the real system , depends on the atomic mass ratio , the trapping frequencies and the @xmath9 scattering length @xmath10 in free space ( c.f .",
    "[ figscattering ] ) . a detailed study of this 0d-2d scattering process will be extensively presented elsewhere @xcite . for the purposes of present work we assume @xmath11 to be tunable in its full range of existence @xmath14 , protecting the validity of the point - like approximation for @xmath0 . in this regime",

    "we finally recall that , in the case of 2d scattering , the limit @xmath18 corresponds to a weakly attractive interaction , while for @xmath19 the effective potential allows a single , infinitely deep bound state and results weakly repulsive for positive - energy scattering states @xcite .",
    "let us start by considering now a general case in which @xmath20 point - like @xmath0 scatterers are fixed at positions @xmath21 .",
    "the first steps of our calculation follow @xcite : we consider the hamiltonian of the matter wave ( mw ) as that of a free @xmath1 atom , i.e. @xmath22 with @xmath23 the 2d laplace operator , and add the @xmath9 interaction by imposing the boundary conditions at the position of each @xmath0 scatterer .",
    "this introduces a set of @xmath20 independent complex coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "the same conditions apply to the mw green s function @xmath25 , solution of the schrdinger equation for a point - like source term of matter waves in @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the latter wave equation can be rewritten to take directly into account the boundary conditions . by using the identity @xmath28 , the effect of contact conditions resumes in the inclusion of secondary point - like sources of amplitude @xmath24 at the position of each scatterer @xcite , leading to @xmath29 since the poles of @xmath30 ( and of its analytical continuation to complex energies in the lower half - plane ) correspond to eigenstates of the system ,",

    "the formal solution of the wave equation is hence @xmath41 where the determination of the @xmath20 coefficients @xmath24 depends on the system geometry , encoded in the set @xmath21 .",
    "this problem can be led back to the solution of a complex linear system in the @xmath20 unknowns @xmath24 .",
    "each equation of such system comes from the limit @xmath42 of eq .  , imposing the bethe - peierls condition on the lhs and applying @xmath43 { } 1+\\frac{2i}{\\pi}\\ln\\left(\\frac{e^\\gamma}{2}kr\\right)+o(1)\\ ] ] on the rhs , where @xmath44 is the euler - mascheroni constant . after some straightforward algebraic manipulation the system can be cast as @xmath45 with the introduction of the matrix @xmath46 of elements @xmath47 the formal solution of @xmath30 ( eq .  )",
    "has a pole if @xmath46 is not invertible , i.e. if @xmath48 .",
    "the latter is thus our general condition for the existence of an eigenstate of the mw in the gas of scatterers .",

    "for @xmath37 the situation is slightly different .",
