    "@xcite seems to confirm the paradoxical nature of the quantum world indeed .",
    "we propose here a model that makes it very natural to distinguish between states and observation probabilities in quantum models .",
    "the mathematical key in our analysis is the study of general trace preserving linear operators on the space of self - adjoint matrices rather than length preserving linear operators on the space of wave functions .",
    "this approach is very much in line with the classical markov model for evolution of states in time and thus yields a comprehensive model for quantum markov chains as a byproduct , which includes the random walk model of aharonov _ et al . _",

    "the elementary units in our model are markov densities , _",
    "i.e. _ , self - adjoint matrices with trace @xmath0 .",
    "markov densities do not necessarily correspond to probabilities but are primarily mathematical descriptions of states of preparation of a system .",
    "it follows that a quantum measurement is not necessarily observable in a ( macro-)statistical sense if the system is in a general markov state .",
    "hence it is meaningful to ask when a measurement is observable ( section  [ sec : measurements ] ) .",
    "moreover , the markov model yields a refined tool to analyze notions of joint observability of not just two but three or more measurements .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : bells - inequality ] that the markov perspective provides a novel look at bell s inequality .",
    "in particular , it shows that a violation of bell s inequality is not contradictory to but compatible with hidden state models .",
    "in fact , we argue in section  [ sec : measurement - hidden - states ] that hidden state models are natural within ( classical or quantum ) markov models of measurements .    as was pointed out previously ( see @xcite ) , the epr paradox can be reframed as resulting from epr s stipulation that all observables associated with the preparation of a system follow a joint probability distribution which reflects a probability distribution over the inherent hidden states .",
    "feynman suggested to resolve the problem by allowing joint probabilities to be negative , which triggers philosophical difficulties with the interpretation of such quantities .",
    "here , we allow systems to be prepared with a clear view on their hidden states without requiring a preparation to be probabilistic . instead , we insist that meaningful observations be statistically analyzable .",
    "so , according to the standard tenet that quantum measurements are associated with probability distributions , hidden states can perhaps not be measured statistically meaningfully .",
    "but they can very well be meaningfully encoded in terms of ( markov ) densities .    motivated by wigner s  @xcite distribution , already dirac  @xcite and",

    "<S> it turns out that hidden state models are natural in the markov context . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a violation of bell s inequality is seen to be compatible with the existence of hidden states . </S>",
