    "poroelasticity @xcite and thermoelasticity problems @xcite are mathematically and physically analogous due to the fact that the pressure and temperature play a similar role in deformation of a body .",
    "for instance , a change in the temperature or a change in the pressure in a body results in equal normal strains in three orthogonal directions and no shear strains .",
    "the basic mathematical models of such problems include the lame equation for the motion and the pressure / temperature equations .",
    "the fundamental point is that the system of equations is coupled : the equation for the motion includes the volume force , which is proportional to the temperature / pressure gradient , and the temperature / pressure equations include the term , which describes the compressibility of a medium .    to solve numerically the coupled quasi - stationary linear system of equations , we approximate our system using the finite element method @xcite .",
    "variational formulations for poroelasticity and thermoelasticity problems and finite element approximations are considered in @xcite . due to the incompressibility constraint on the displacement field at the initial state ( incompressible elasticity and",
    "stokes type problem ) , the finite element interpolation with equal order spaces for both the displacement and pressure / temperature fields is not correct . it is well known that in classical mixed formulations , the finite element spaces must satisfy the lbb stability conditions @xcite .",
    "these kind of discretizations for poroelasticity problems provides a lower order of convergence for the pressure in comparison with the displacements .    quasi - stationary problem ( steady for motion and unsteady for the temperature / pressure )",
    "is solved using the weighted scheme @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis is performed @xcite in the framework of the general theory of stability for operator - difference schemes @xcite .    at present , different classes of additive operator ",
    "difference schemes for evolutionary equations are constructed via an additive representation of the main operator onto several terms .",
    "additive schemes are constructed using splitting ; they are associated with transition to a new time level on the basis of the solution of simpler problems for individual operators in the additive decomposition @xcite .",
    "we consider splitting ( additive ) schemes for poroelasticity / thermoelasticity problems with additive representation of the operator at the time derivative ; we also consider modifications of splitting schemes .",
    "similar schemes are examined in many studies @xcite , but in our work , we show that these schemes are no more than regularization schemes @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides the mathematical model for the poroelasticity problem , which is the same as the thermoelasticity problem . in section 3",
    ", we consider properties of the differential problem and give a priory estimates for the stability for the solutions with respect to initial the data and the right - hand side . in this section",
    ", we also formulate our problem as an initial value problem for a system of linear ordinary differential equations .",
    "discretizations in space and in time are performed in section 4 .",
    "here we conduct some analysis of the weighted differential schemes for coupled system . the central part of the work deals with the construction and numerical comparison of the stability of the splitting schemes . in section 5 , we consider the additive ( splitting ) schemes that are compared for typical poroelasticity problems in section 7 .",
    "some modifications for additive ( splitting ) schemes associated with regularization are introduced in section 6 .",
    "the results of numerical simulation of a 3d problem on hight performance computing systems are presented in section 8 .",
    "the linear poroelasticity equations can be expressed @xcite as @xmath0 with the boundary conditions @xmath1 and the initial conditions @xmath2 here the primary variables are the fluid pressure @xmath3 and the displacement vector @xmath4 . also , @xmath5 is the stress tensor , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the biot modulus , @xmath8 is the permeability , @xmath9 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath10 is the biot - willis fluid / solid coupling coefficient and @xmath11 is a source term representing injection or production processes .",
