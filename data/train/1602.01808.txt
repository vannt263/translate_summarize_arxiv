    "in the last two decades , evolutionary game theory  @xcite ( hereinafter egt ) has strongly developed into a mature field that , nowadays , represents a vivid and independent research area with a list of applications spanning from biology to social systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , egt constitutes a powerful framework for modelling a variety of phenomena characterized by evolutionary dynamics  @xcite and complex interaction patterns .",
    "the emergence of cooperation  @xcite is one of the central topics in egt .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma  @xcite ( pd ) and the @xmath0-person pd , also called public goods game ( pgg ) , represent the typical game - theoretical examples in which individual and social interests collide .",
    "in fact , in the pd game , two players can decide to mutually cooperate for achieving a common goal but , at the same time , they are both tempted to exploit their co - player in order to obtain an higher payoff . among other mechanisms  @xcite ,",
    "_ network reciprocity _ has been proposed as a fundamental tool to promote cooperation in structured populations of unlabelled and anonymous individuals .",
    "recently , a series of works  @xcite discovered that , even when agents interactions are based upon nash equilibria  @xcite in which _ defection _ ( not cooperation ) theoretically dominates cooperative strategies , agent , and even human , populations are able to end up in a cooperative equilibrium  @xcite . in this framework , it is interesting to identify behaviors and properties that may lead a population towards cooperation , although defection constitutes the riskless and , egoistically , the most convenient strategy .",
    "for instance , motion  @xcite and competitiveness  @xcite seem to promote cooperation in the spatial prisoner s dilemma .",
    "remarkably , egt allows also to study the role of social influences in dilemmas , as reported in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite authors investigate the role of conformity  @xcite in social dilemmas , by simulating a two - species population whose agents , embedded in a scale - free network  @xcite , play the pd game ; the two species forming the population were : payoff - driven agents and conformist agents .",
    "their relevant result shows that conformity may enhance social reciprocity , highlighting its beneficial role in the resolution of social dilemmas .",
    "it is worth observing that conformity is one of the most investigated behaviors in the modern field of sociophysics  @xcite , i.e , the field attempting to analyze socio - economic systems under the lens of statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "moreover , conformity has been shown to deeply influence opinion dynamics  @xcite , and more in general phenomena of social spreading , as well as evolutionary dynamics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite authors show that conformity ( and nonconformity ) may lead a population towards a disordered phase , i.e. , a coexistence of different agents , and towards non - linear dynamics ( e.g. , bistable ) . in this work , we investigate the spatial pgg by considering a population composed of conformity - driven agents and fitness - driven agents . thus , while the former update their strategy by adopting that of majority in their neighborhood , the latter tend to imitate their richest neighbor ( i.e. , the most fitted ) .",
    "although the pgg exhibits a theoretically predicted nash equilibrium of defection , previous works identified several strategies to support cooperation , spanning from awarding mechanisms ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) to optimal game settings .",
    "notably , in  @xcite authors report that the synergy factor , adopted to compute the agents payoff , can be opportunely tuned in order to support cooperation in bi - dimensional regular lattices .",
    "this result is very important as it entails that if the payoff of cooperators reaches , or overtakes , a minimum value , all agents turn their strategy to cooperation .",
    "as below , the minimum threshold of the synergy factor depends on the topology of the population ( i.e. , the way agents are arranged ) . therefore , adding a social influence in the pgg implies dealing with two degrees of freedom : the synergy factor @xmath1 ( whose individual effect is known ) and the density of conformist agents @xmath2 .",
    "the proposed model is studied by means of numerical simulations and performed by arranging agents that play a spatial pgg on a bi - dimensional regular lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] introduces the proposed model .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows results of numerical simulations .",
    "conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we present in detail the public goods game and the proposed model . in general , the pgg considers a population of @xmath3 agents that can adopt two different strategies : cooperation and defection . at each time step , cooperators contribute with a unit to a common pool , whereas defectors do the opposite , i.e. , not contribute .",
    "the payoff of the pgg reads @xmath4 with @xmath5 number of cooperators , @xmath1 synergy factor , and @xmath6 amount of agents involved in the game .",
    "after all agents have made a decision and earned their corresponding payoff , they undergo a round of strategy revision phase , i.e. , they can change their strategy from cooperation to defection , or vice versa .",
    "the synergy factor plays a key role in this dynamics  @xcite , as it promotes cooperation .",
    "in particular , it is possible to compute , for a given population structure , the minimal value of @xmath1 , here denoted as @xmath7 , for which any @xmath8 allows cooperators to survive , or even to succeed , under particular evolutionary dynamics .",
    "now , a brief remark deserves attention : we can identify two different phases ( or equilibria )  @xcite : a paramagnetic equilibrium in which we observe the coexistence of cooperators and defectors , and a ferromagnetic equilibrium , implying that only one species prevails .",
    "usually , the pgg is based on the assumption that agents change their strategy only according to rules based on the payoff  @xcite , e.g. , each agent imitates the richest ( or most successful ) neighbor , which is our definition of rational thinking  @xcite . in our model",
    ", we aim to investigate the outcomes of the pgg in an heterogeneous population , i.e. , composed of fitness - driven agents ( fdas ) and conformity - driven agents ( cdas ) . specifically , we map the fitness to the agents s payoff , so that the richest one is identified also as the fittest one .",
    "this assumption is far from general , as the fitness might be related to various other factors , but we believe to be anyhow characterizing several realistic economic systems .",
    "thus , fdas in our model tend to imitate the richest agent in their neighborhood . instead , conformity - driven agents are those who blindly imitate the strategy of the majority in their neighborhood .",
    "the strategy of cdas thus depends on the local connectivity of the underlying interaction graph , and in particular on the degree of the agent . given these premises , our model can be thus parametrized by the tuple ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , where the first corresponds to the number of fitness - driven agents , and the second to the number of conformity - driven agents .",
    "if we normalize by the total number of agents @xmath11 , the densities @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy the relation : @xmath14 .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we use the convention in which upper indices refer to the strategy ( i.e. , cooperation and defection ) , while lower indices to the agent s nature ( i.e. , conformity - driven and fitness - driven ) . in the proposed model , fdas may change strategy in a probabilistic manner .",
    "we implement a fermi rule  @xcite to compute the transition probability between two different strategies for fdas , so that the @xmath15-th agent imitates the @xmath16-th one , which reads @xmath17\\right)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate the strategy of the agents @xmath16 and @xmath15 , respectively , meanwhile @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicate their payoff ; the constant @xmath22 parametrizes the uncertainty in adopting a strategy ( i.e. , the temperature ) . by using @xmath23",
    ", we implement a rational and meritocratic approach during the strategy revision phase  @xcite .",
    "cdas adopt a simple majority voting  @xcite rule to decide their next strategy : an agent computes the transition probability according to the density of neighbors having the strategy of majority .",
    "we emphasize that we implement two different rules for the two species , as fdas act rationally ( as mapped by the parameter @xmath22 ) , while cdas follow a basic social behavior . in this work",
    "we implement an interaction graph which , following  @xcite , consists of a bi - dimensional regular lattice of degree @xmath24 with periodic boundary conditions ( a torus ) .",
    "we consider a balanced initial condition for the density of cooperators and defectors , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , as in the classical version of the evolutionary pgg , the agent population may reach two possible equilibria : an ordered phase or a disordered phase , depending on the varying the degrees of freedom .",
    "we summarize the algorithm for simulating the evolution of our agent population :    1 .   at the beginning set @xmath26 , and set the density of conformists",
    "@xmath27 $ ] ; 2 .",
    "select randomly one agent , and select randomly one of its neighbors ; 3 .",
    "each selected agent plays the pgg with all its communities of belonging , then compute their payoff ; 4 .",
    "perform the strategy revision phase for the second selected agent ; 5 .",
    "repeat from @xmath28 until an ordered phase is reached , or up to a limited number of time steps elapsed .",
    "we emphasize that all simulations are performed by considering as initial condition @xmath29 and , since the considered topologies is a bi - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , all agents have @xmath24 neighbors .",
    "we investigate the behavior of the proposed model for different values of @xmath2 , from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and of @xmath1 .",
    "the latter assumes values in the range @xmath32 $ ] since , in this topology , it is known from  @xcite that the two thresholds for different equilibria are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the threshold @xmath35 indicates that lower values of @xmath1 lead the population towards a phase of full defection at equilibrium . for intermediate values of @xmath1 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath36 , the population reaches a disordered phase , i.e. , a mixed phase characterized by the coexistence of both species at equilibrium ; eventually , for values of @xmath37 cooperators succeed , i.e. , the population reaches an ordered phase of full cooperation .",
    "we remark that the neighborhood for each agent has always @xmath24 agents according to the adopted lattice topology with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "groups of belonging are defined by each selected agent and all its neighbors , and also taking every single neighbor who forms a new group where the selected agent is included .",
    "therefore , one agent plays in @xmath38 different groups at a time , all composed of @xmath38 members .",
    "finally , we remind that agents may change strategy , i.e. , from cooperation to defection ( and vice versa ) , but they can not change their nature ( i.e. , fitness - driven and conformity - driven ) . in order to investigate the proposed model , we perform many numerical simulations with populations of different size , from @xmath39 to @xmath40 agents , starting each simulation run with an equal amount of cooperators and defectors ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) .",
    "the first analysis is related to the distribution of strategies , at equilibrium , on varying the synergy factor @xmath1 and the density of conformists @xmath2 see figure  [ fig : cooperation ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the disordered phase becomes narrower as @xmath2 increases .",
    "notably , we observe that @xmath35 and @xmath42 are strongly affected by @xmath2 . at a first glance ,",
    "as also reported in  @xcite , conformity fosters cooperation , as @xmath42 strongly reduces while increasing @xmath2 . on the other hand , for @xmath43 a bistable behavior",
    "is expected as agents change strategy without to consider the payoff .",
    "therefore both outcomes , i.e. , full cooperation and full defection , can be achieved under this condition . in order to characterize the transition at fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "since we observe qualitatively different phases , we tentatively try to identify the critical lines by studying the behavior of the variance as a function of @xmath1 . here , the variance @xmath44 is referred to the magnetization of the system  @xcite ( i.e. , the order parameter ) defined as @xmath45 with @xmath46 strategy of the @xmath47-th agent , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the variance @xmath44 is computed as @xmath49 with @xmath50 number of simulations performed under the same conditions ( i.e. , fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and @xmath51 average magnetization ( computed in the same conditions ) . plot * a * of figure  [ fig : phase ] ( a ) shows the variance @xmath44 for different values of @xmath2 : @xmath52 , in function of the synergy factor @xmath1 .        as expected , we found that for @xmath53 the variance is maximum at @xmath54 .",
    "plots * b , c , d * of figure  [ fig : phase ] illustrate how these curves scale as we increase the number of agents for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . here",
    ", we note that increasing @xmath3 the threshold @xmath35 decreases , as the finite size effect reduces .",
    "then , in order to characterize the bistable behavior shown in figure  [ fig : cooperation ] , we study the probability of being in the defecting or the cooperating phase in function of @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : probability_r ] ) and of @xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : probability_rho ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : probability_r ] the two dotted lines refer to the winning probabilities of defectors ( i.e. , blue ) and of cooperators ( i.e. , red )",
    ". therefore , for @xmath55 , the two curves are zero in the intermediate range of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath58 , as none is expected to completely succeed .",
    "remarkably , increasing @xmath2 we found the paramagnetic range of @xmath1 reducing and then disappearing for values @xmath59 .",
    "as shown in plots * b * and * c * of figure  [ fig : probability_r ] , at least one curve is always greater than zero .",
    "although we are dealing with success probabilities , it is worth noting that the summation of values taken by the two curves has to be @xmath60 , thus even zero as it means that none succeeds once the disordered phase is reached .",
    "moreover figure  [ fig : probability_r ] allows to observe the emergence of a bistable behavior , e.g. , for @xmath61 at @xmath62 we have both curves having the same @xmath63 , i.e. , about @xmath64 of cases defectors prevail , while in the remaining cases cooperators completely succeed .",
    "figure  [ fig : probability_rho ] aims to characterize the same bistable behavior on varying @xmath2 and keeping fixed @xmath1 .",
    "plot * a * of figure  [ fig : probability_rho ] refers to @xmath62 and it lets emerge an interesting result : in the range @xmath65 defectors prevail .",
    "this indicates that in this region conformity is promoting defectors , being @xmath30 the expected value of @xmath63 for both species .",
    "moreover , the bistable behavior emerges as @xmath59 .",
    "plot * b * of figure  [ fig : probability_rho ] refers to @xmath66 and shows that the upper bound of the paramagnetic phase ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) is reduced to @xmath67 as @xmath59 .",
    "then , a bistable behavior emerges for @xmath68 .",
    "eventually , in plot * c * of figure  [ fig : probability_rho ] referred to @xmath69 , we see that even for lower values of @xmath2 cooperators succeed , and the bistable behavior emerges for @xmath70 . in the light of these results , we can state that when @xmath1 is close to the lower bound of the paramagnetic phase , i.e. , @xmath35 , conformity supports defectors until the emergence of a bistable behavior .",
    "instead , for higher values of @xmath1 , conformity supports cooperators , and only for high values of @xmath2 the system becomes bistable . finally , we are able to construct an approximate phase diagram of our system see figure  [ fig : critdiag ] . in the top part we have the domination of cooperation ( i.e. , red ) , and in the lower one that of defection ( i.e. , blue ) . along the line separating the two parts above identified ( at fixed @xmath1 )",
    ", we find an important point indicated as @xmath71 below described . in an area of the left diagram between defection and cooperation , for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,",
    "defectors and cooperators coexist , with the prevalence of the former . in this region , one can change the parameters to reach smoothly the cooperation region .",
    "for @xmath74 we have the coexistence of cooperation and defection on the critical line @xmath75 , due to the fact that @xmath42 approaches @xmath35 as an increasing function of @xmath2 . the point in which @xmath76 is a tricritical point .",
    "in this work we study the spatial pgg in the presence of social influences . in particular , we consider two different kinds of agents : conformity - driven agents ( cdas ) and fitness - driven agents ( fdas ) .",
    "the former are those that imitate the strategy ( i.e. , cooperation or defection ) of majority , while the latter are those that tend to imitate the richest players . in both cases , cdas and fdas",
    "update their strategy by considering only their neighborhood , defined according to a bi - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "previous studies  @xcite reported that social influences strongly influence evolutionary games . in particular , in  @xcite authors find that conformity enhances cooperation in the prisoner s dilemma game , while in  @xcite authors show that conformity may become a kind of noise in these dynamics .",
    "although the proposed model is different from those implemented in previous cited investigations ( i.e. ,  @xcite ) , as for instance we consider the spatial pgg while they considered the prisoner s dilemma , our results confirm those investigations , on a quality level , and extend to further findings .",
    "in fact , our results highlight the prominent role of conformity in the spatial pgg .",
    "it seems that this social influence may lead the population towards different phases and behaviors , as full cooperation and bistable equilibria . in particular , conformity promotes the population to reach an ordered phase , even when a disordered one is expected ( according to the used value of synergy factor ) . for intermediate densities of conformists ( e.g. , @xmath77 ) , the final equilibrium is that closer to that one would expect considering only fdas , at a given @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , our investigations suggest that conformity drives the system towards ordered states , with a prevalence for cooperative equilibria .",
    "eventually , in this work we focus on the identification of an order - disorder phase transition  @xcite that characterizes the behavior of our population on varying the degrees of freedom . in general , as shown in  [ fig : cooperation ] , conformity was confirmed to promote cooperation in a game with a defection nash equilibrium ( as also reported in  @xcite ) . in particular , the minimal threshold of synergy factor to avoid cooperators disappear reduces to values smaller than @xmath62 ( computed in  @xcite and confirmed here for @xmath55 ) when @xmath2 is greater than @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , considering the higher threshold @xmath42 ( i.e. , that to obtain full cooperation for @xmath55 ) , we observe that even with low density of conformist agents , @xmath42 decreases , up to reach a value slightly smaller than @xmath67 . in the range",
    "@xmath79 $ ] , a closer look allows to note a richer behavior of our model see plot * b * of figure  [ fig : cooperation ] .",
    "we notice that defectors succeed only for values of @xmath1 smaller than @xmath80 , while cooperators succeed for values of @xmath1 greater than @xmath81 . as result",
    "the mixed phase is obtained only in a narrow range between the two listed values ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) . for values of @xmath83",
    "we found a bistable behavior as , at each run , sometime cooperators complete succeed , sometimes defectors prevail .",
    "thus , since our results are computed as average values of different simulation runs , the colors represented in both plots of figure  [ fig : cooperation ] in some cases reflect the probability to find the final population in a given status starting with those initial conditions ( i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "this behavior was identified even for values of @xmath2 smaller than @xmath84 when @xmath66 .",
    "a further analysis focused on the winning probabilities ( see figures  [ fig : probability_r ] and  [ fig : probability_rho ] ) highlights that for @xmath1 close to the lower bound of the paramagnetic phase ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) , conformity supports defectors .",
    "therefore , we can state that conformity fosters ordered phases , i.e. , it reduces the paramagnetic area in the strategy distribution diagram ( figure  [ fig : cooperation ] ) .",
    "moreover , conformity supports defectors only in particular conditions , otherwise in general it supports cooperators ( as found in  @xcite ) . to conclude ,",
    "although our results are , on a quality level , in agreement with those achieved in previous works , we found that the pgg under social influences may have a very rich behavior , characterized by different final states .",
    "notably , although in general conformity enhances cooperation , under some conditions it can lead the population towards bistable equilibria , or even to foster defection .",
