    "scientists have been trying long ago to mix positive and negative masses to compose a new cosmological model .",
    "the lacunar structure of the universe at large scales early suggested that some negative matter could have formed clumps , repelling positive matter into remnant places shaped like joint bubbles .",
    "such a bubble structure was suggested in 1986 by de lapparent et al . @xcite then by kirshner et al .",
    "@xcite in 1986 , rood @xcite in 1988 and geller et al .",
    "@xcite in 1989 .",
    "the idea of repulsive structures , shaping positive matter into lacunar structures was progressively developped by el - ad et al .",
    "+ the possibility of gravitational repulsion was explicitely evoked by piran @xcite in 1997 , a paper in which he suggested that initial tiny perturbations in the primordial density field , `` acting as if they had a negative mass '' , could expand and play a role in the vls ( very large scale ) structure .",
    "he further theorized , with no justification however , that negative mass could own a negative active mass ( from bondi s definition @xcite ) , but positive inertial and passive masses , so that two negative masses would mutually attract .",
    "hence , negative material could form clusters while positive and negative masses would repel each other .",
    "he developped a void finder algorithm allowing to identify voids in redshift surveys and to measure their size and `` underdensity '' .",
    "interesting three - dimensional views of voids , based on the iras survey , are shown in his paper @xcite .",
    "+ 2d - simulations involving the same interaction schema had been performed by petit @xcite in 1995 , also giving a vls lacunar structure . more recently ( july 2013 ) izumi et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the distortions observed on the images of distant galaxies , if considered as due to some negative gravitational lensing effect being radial instead of azimutal , would lead to a somewhat different mapping of the invisible matter .",
    "+ however , all these works contradicted bondi s result of 1957 @xcite based on general relativity ( gr ) , hence on the assumption that the universe is a m4 manifold , coupled to a single metric g obeying einstein s equation .",
    "the newtonian approximation gives such a metric a time independent quasi - lorentzian form : @xmath0 + a subsequent development of the field equation into a series , combined to similar approximation of the equations of geodesics , provides newton s law and poisson s equation .",
    "bondi expressed the result as : @xmath1 accounting for the gravitational action of a mass ( 2 ) on a mass ( 1 ) , and decided to introduce three kinds of masses : + - inertial mass @xmath2 + - passive gravitational mass @xmath3 + - active gravitational mass @xmath4 + because of the equivalence principle the first two are identical , so that equ .",
    "[ gravbondi ] becomes : @xmath5 + in other words : according to gr , a positive mass attracts any kind of mass , whatever positive or negative .",
    "conversely , a negative mass would repel any kind of mass .",
    "in particular , if one considers a couple of masses with equal absolute values but opposite signs , the negative mass escapes , while the positive mass runs after it , both being accelerated the same way . to increase such paradoxical phenomenon , because the masses have opposite signs , energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "+ in addition , according to bondi s analysis two negative masses mutually repel , so that negative matter can not form clusters by gravitational accretion through jeans instability .",
    "+ bondi tried to integrate such puzzling `` runaway particles '' in gr without any success .",
    "only much later , in 1989 , bonnor @xcite also published a paper devoted to negative mass .",
    "he considered the runaway phenomenon as `` preposterous '' and studied a universe only filled with negative masses , immediatly pointing out that this has nothing to do with physics and astrophysics , for such a medium can not form stars and galaxies through gravitational instability .",
    "+   + as a conclusion , in despite of interesting perspectives suggested by the previously mentioned references , gr bans any introduction of negative masses in the universe , unless giving up the equivalence principle itself .",
    "a first tentative solution was suggested in 1994 by petit @xcite , and later by henry - couannier @xcite , then hossenfelder @xcite . all",
    "are based on a new description of the universe , considered as a manifold m4 coupled to two metrics instead of a single one .",
    "+   + basically , the first metric @xmath6 refers to positive energy particles ( and positive mass , if they have one ) , and @xmath7 to negative energy particles ( and negative mass , if they have one ) .",
    "opposite energy particles can not encounter , for they cruise on distinct geodesic families .",
    "both families include null geodesics , with positive energy photons cruising on null geodesics built from metric @xmath6 , while negative energy photons cruise on null geodesics built from metric @xmath7 .",
    "it is assumed than positive structures , made of positive masses , can emit or absorb positive energy photons only , while negative structures , made of negative masses , can emit and absorb negative energy photons only . in short , on purely geometrical grounds",
    ", negative mass structures would be invisible for a positive mass observer ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "+   + first , let us consider a system of coupled field equations with which we intend to describe a time - independant configuration , or quasi time - independant .",
    "the study of a time dependant solution , based on a modified system will be the subject of a next publication .",
    "@xmath8 + we find the ricci tensors built from metrics @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in the simple case of non interacting incoherent matters , can be expressed in term of the scalar proper density fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 and four - velocity flows @xmath13 by : @xmath14 .",
    "+   + in the newtonian approximation , for both species , the velocities are small with respect to the speed of light and the energy densities low .",
    "the energy - momentum tensors for a field of matter can be writen , in this case , as : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 +   + in the newtonian approximation , the system ( [ riccipm ] ) admits , for @xmath18 a couple of lorentzian solutions @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath21 + let us consider two time - independent small perturbations with finite extents , and write the metrics and the mass densities as : @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
