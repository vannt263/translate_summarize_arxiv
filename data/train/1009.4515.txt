    "the cooling and trapping of ions and atoms have a number of similarities in terms of the experimental techniques and the physics they address .",
    "individually , cold atom physics as well as cold ion physics are both sufficiently mature for investigating some of the most exciting problems , ranging from sensitive tests of qed , fundamental interactions and symmetries at one end to many particle physics at the other  @xcite .",
    "inter - particle collisions at these temperatures exhibit several interesting features that are masked at higher temperatures / energies and is therefore likely to lead to phenomena that relate to the asymptotic molecular potential energy states .",
    "cold and ultra - cold chemistry with molecules and atoms as the principal material ingredients is an exciting and emerging area of research  @xcite .",
    "several techniques and processes have been invented to study the low energy interactions between the constituents of dilute ultracold gases .",
    "the overwhelming majority of these employ precise addressing of the specific atomic or molecular states in order to facilitate the interactions . in a cold dilute gas of atoms ,",
    "the near neighbour distances range from a few @xmath0 m to a few 100 nm .",
    "these distances are very large compared to the equilibrium bond lengths of molecules , i.e. the distance that characterizes the minimum of the molecular potential energy curves / surfaces .",
    "further , at ultracold temperatures , the atoms have negligible kinetic energy , making the collision probability for distant atoms small .",
    "thus an important step in enhancing the reactivity between atoms at large distances is to gather them together in small local groups within the overall volume of the cold dilute gas .",
    "bringing together atoms within the cold gas cloud requires an aggregating mechanism for the atoms . a natural choice for microscopic , many centered , aggregators is cold atomic ions interspersed within a cloud of dilute gas atoms or molecules  @xcite .",
    "the stark interaction between the ionic charge centers and the neighboring atoms has the potential to mediate the aggregation . to make this possible",
    ", cold ions must be trapped simultaneously and with spatial overlap with dilute gas atoms and molecules .",
    "thus an important technical goal in this direction is the construction of an apparatus which is capable of holding cold ions and cold atoms simultaneously .",
    "this has been originally proposed and developed by smith et.al .",
    "@xcite and later modified for specific goals  @xcite .",
    "the present apparatus is therefore designed and built with the intention of provoking chemistry of cold dilute gases , with and in the presence of ions .",
    "the ions are created from the trapped alkali atoms in a magneto optical trap ( mot ) and are optically inactive at reasonable light wavelengths and so the ions can not be laser cooled .",
    "several thousand daughter ions can be created and trapped from the parent mot atoms and held in contact with the ultracold atoms . due to the parent - daughter atom - ion relation ,",
    "the resonant charge exchange channel for collision opens up , in addition to the elastic collision channel .",
    "the resonant charge exchange is important as the collision rate in this channel is independent of the collision speed of the ion atom pair over a large range of energies  @xcite .",
    "also the polarizability of the neutral alkali atoms in the excited states  @xcite is significantly larger than the ground state polarizability , adding an interesting aspect to the ion atom interaction in a mot .",
    "the incorporation of charged particle detection for the trapped ion(s ) will allow us to detect the products of inelastic collisions and the formation of ion complexes in a generic fashion .",
    "this feature enables the measurement of branching ratios for a variety of ion - atom processes .",
    "since the simultaneous magneto - optical trapping of various species of alkali atoms in the same experiment is relatively straightforward , cross species interactions are an important goal on the instrument described below . at temperatures lower than the mot temperature , combining different species and isolating specific interactions in the evaporative cooling regime for atoms",
    "is expected to be very challenging as the atomic population is in constant decay and inter - atom collisions are important by themselves .",
    "finally , the choice of ion and atom determine the molecular states that mediate the ion - atom interaction .",
    "the alkali atom - alkali ion interact via the doublet states , the alkali atom - alkaline earth ion systems via the singlet or triplet molecular states , and so on . in each case , different physical consequences are likely .",
    "in this paper we present our experiment and characterize the principle features of the apparatus .",
    "we discuss , ( a)the design and construction of the experiment , ( b ) the choice of the ion and atom , ( c ) independent characterization of the atom and ion traps , ( d ) the effect of the trapping field of the ion / atom traps on the trapped atoms / ions respectively , ( e ) simultaneous trapping of atoms and ions , ( f ) the signatures of ion - atom interactions .",
    "we conclude the article with a discussion on the nature of experiments possible in the future with the apparatus described here .",
    "to accommodate trapped ions and cold trapped atoms , with spatial overlap , several aspects need to be considered .",
    "most importantly , the effect of operation of the ion trap should have negligible effect on the atom trap and vice versa .",
    "paul traps have no gradient magnetic field while the mot for atoms requires the presence of a gradient magnetic field ( @xmath1 gauss / cm ) .",
    "given a six - beam mot along the cartesian axes , the basic design challenge reduces to construction of the ion trap such as to allow a robust mot within its confines .",
    "since modest electric fields are required to trap ions , there is reasonable flexibility in the design of the ion trap .",
    "the ion trap implemented in our experiment is the linear paul trap .",
    "it consists of four parallel rods arranged in a square ( quadrupole ) configuration and end cap ring electrodes along the common cylindrical axis . a time varying radio - frequency ( rf ) voltage is applied to diagonally opposite rods , with the voltage along the two diagonals being 180@xmath2 out of phase .",
    "the transverse cross section of the ion trap , the rf bias diagram and the potential surface at a given instant is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iontrapschematic ] .",
    "the end cap ring electrodes are held at a constant voltage with respect to the experimental ground .",
    "for such a potential an approximate analytical form for the field configuration in the central region of the ion trap can be written as ,    @xmath3.\\ ] ]    here @xmath4 and @xmath5 represents the applied amplitude and frequency of the time varying trapping field , @xmath6 , the end cap d.c .",
    "voltage , @xmath7 the trap extent and @xmath8 is a geometric factor . for our experiment ,",
    "large spacing between electrodes is required to accommodate the laser beams of 10 mm diameter to create the @xmath9rb mot at the trap center , which is also the geometric center of the vacuum chamber , henceforth identified as the origin .",
    "the rod diameter ` a ' of 3 mm and separation of the neighbouring quadrupole electrodes ` d ' of 10 mm allows the 10 mm mot beams .",
    "the end caps of the ion trap are hollow rings 25.5 mm away from the trap center .",
    "it should be noted that the rf node would intersect the mot along a diameter of the spherical atom cloud .",
    "the schematic of the experimental arangement is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptschematic ] .        due to the unique demands of the experiment , the design of the ion trap had to be validated by numerical simulations .",
    "the potentials are generated using simion for each equipotential set of electrodes .",
    "care was taken to simulate the entire potential environment in the vacuum chamber including the channel electron multiplier ( cem ) so that the boundary conditions for the operating trap were realistic .",
    "the potential array was then imported into mathematica , where the ion trajectories for single ions  @xcite as well as simultaneous multiple ions can be solved for , with the desired accuracy .",
    "a fit of the above analytical potential to the numerically calculated potential yields @xmath10 mm . with @xmath11 mm the geometric parameter @xmath12 is calculated for the trap .",
    "the extraction of the trapped ions and their detection is also simulated with accuracy .    in order to work around the above geometric constraints , and restrict to a single , flexible vacuum chamber ,",
    "a kimball physics vacuum chamber with sixteen cf16 and two cf100 ports is used .",
    "since the diameter of the mot laser beams ( 10 mm ) , is small for a vapor loading mot , the chamber was chosen to be flat .",
    "a schematic of the chamber identifying the principle components is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptschematic ] .",
    "this particular chamber allows for large optical access in the vertical ( y direction ) and the horizontal ( x - z plane ) .",
    "the ion - trap structure is mounted symmetrically , along the chamber diameter , using mounting grooves built into the chamber .",
    "this feature fixes the core of the experiment onto the chamber directly , providing rigid mounting .",
    "electrical isolation is achieved between the various electrodes of the ion trap using a mount machined out of macor , which is secured to the grooves in the vacuum system using groove grabbers .",
    "the metallic ion trap parts are primarily machined from ss-316 which is non magnetic and minor metallic components like screws are also non magnetic .",
    "electrical connections are made using multi - pin feedthroughs at the closest convenient ports .",
    "a cem is placed , 86 mm away from the origin , along the trap axis to detect the trapped ions .",
    "uncoated , cf view ports are used on all optically transparent ports .",
    "the mot beam arrangement is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptschematic ] .",
    "additional view ports are used for the fluorescence detection of the trapped atoms , two - photon ionization ( tpi ) of the atoms by a frequency doubled , pulsed nd : yag laser , the mounting of getter sources for the alkali atoms , blue light led for light induced atomic desorption ( liad ) loading of the mot , and connecting the experiment chamber to the titanium sublimation and ion pumps .",
    "the ultimate vacuum possible in the experiment is under range of the ion gauge , and under normal operating condition the pressure is typically adjusted between few times 10@xmath13 mbar to 1@xmath1410@xmath15 mbar .",
    "the experimental arrangement for the cold atoms is typical of many vapor cell mot apparatus and so will be dealt with very briefly .",
    "below , we shall mostly dwell on the distinct features of the present experiment , with respect to typical mot experiments . here",
    "we have laser cooled and trapped @xmath9rb atoms , though the experiment lends itself to any other species that can be laser cooled in a vapor cell arrangement .",
    "since the cold atoms need to be trapped at the origin , a six beam mot is implemented , to balance the light pressure .",
    "enough manoeuvre is available with the mot coil mountings to enable small changes in the position of the mot by coil adjustments .",
    "the coils comprise of 100 turns of 1.3 mm diameter wire in a 10@xmath1410 cross sectional stack , wound on a copper former and is capable of sustaining over 10 ampere continuous current without water cooling .",
    "a circulating current of 2.8 ampere in anti - helmoltz configuration produces a gradient magnetic(*b * ) field of 12.3 gauss / cm .",
    "large helmholtz coils sets along the orthogonal coordinate axes can be used to shift the magnetic center or null residual * b * fields .",
    "the alkali atom reservoir is a rb getter ( saes : rb / nf/4.8/17ft10 + 10 ) , which emits the atoms on resistive heating by a few amperes of current .",
    "the mot itself is loaded from the rb vapor , which can either be directly emitted by the rb getter , or alternatively , using desorbed atoms from the walls of the vacuum chamber . for the majority of the experiments reported here",
    ", we use the desorbed atomic vapor to load the mot . to facilitate this ,",
    "the chamber is illuminated by a blue light led ( thorlabs : mrmled ) from a side port , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptschematic ] .",
    "the led illuminates over a wide angle at a central wavelength @xmath16 nm and @xmath17 nm , full width at half maximum . in the presence of the blue",
    "led illumination , alkali atoms are desorbed from the cell walls due to liad  @xcite , which is known to increase in efficiency with decreasing wavelength over the visible range  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the blue light is significantly below the ionization threshold for alkali atoms , so contributes to desorption but not ionization .",
    "the desorbed atoms are much colder than the atoms emitted from the resistively heated alkali getter . unlike the getter , the desorption method recycles the atoms already in the chamber , resulting in better vacuum .",
    "the cooling laser light is derived from a home built extended cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) system capable of top of line stabilization and the repumping laser is a commercial dl100 system ( toptica ) .",
    "the cooling laser light is amplified using a tapered amplifier system ( boosta ) and 2.8 - 4.0 mw / beam of appropriately circularly polarized light beams of 10 mm diameter intersect at the origin .",
    "typically the cooling laser is detuned between 10 - 20 mhz below the @xmath18 transition of the @xmath9rb d2 transition .",
    "the number of atoms that comprise the mot varies from the high @xmath19 to low @xmath20 range .",
    "the density distribution of the mot atoms obtained has a full width at half maximum of @xmath21 @xmath0 m .",
    "an image of the @xmath9rb mot , taken by a ccd camera , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motimageanddist ] .",
    "the number of atoms in the mot and their density are critical to future experiments and so is carefully measured .",
    "fluorescence from the mot is tracked by several ccd cameras for the position in independent directions and a spatial filtering setup in the direction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptschematic ] , at the end of which is a photo - multiplier ( hamamatsu photonics : r636 - 10 ) .",
    "every individual component and the entire system is carefully characterized for its transmission losses so as to determine accurately the total light flux from the mot in the detector acceptance angle .",
    "the blue light led is completely filtered out . given the scattering rate of resonant light by the atoms , the atom number can be determined .",
    "the loading and decay times of the mot are reliably measured in fluorescence , and are of the order of 10 to 20 seconds .",
    "the imaging of the fluorescence from the mot on the ccd camera can be used to derive the density distribution of the atoms in the mot , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : motimageanddist ] .",
    "careful calibration and optimization is needed to ensure that reliable numbers are measured .",
    "the principle sources of error and uncertainty for the number measurement are ( a ) laser intensity variations , ( b ) the laser detuning fluctuation and line width ( c ) the statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the light intensity incident on the photo - multiplier . the overall uncertainty in determining the absolute atom number using the procedures adopted is estimated to be @xmath2218% .",
    "this measurement will be refined with time .",
    "the ion trap design described above is adapted to the experimental goals by enabling large optical access . in what follows",
    "we shall describe the formation , trapping and the detection of the ions in the present trap . + * formation of ions : * the ionization energy ( ie ) required to just eject one electron from a rb atom is 4.177 ev .",
    "the @xmath9rb@xmath23 is loaded into the trap using two - photon ionization , using two different methods . + * method ( a ) * non resonant tpi .",
    "a frequency doubled nd : yag at 532 nm , pulse width @xmath24 ns , and pulse energy of the order of 165 mj / pulse , is focused onto the trap center by a lens of focal length 150 mm , mounted outside the vacuum system .",
    "the pulse energy is adjusted such that the ionization occurs only in the focal region of the beam .",
    "the ionization can be effected from the residual vapor in the trap volume that overlaps with the 532 nm pulse , or from the atoms in the mot .",
    "the dominant ionization process is @xmath25 where the superscript on 2 indicates the possiblilty of more than two photon participating in the ionization process with some probability . a single photon at 532 nm carries 2.33 ev energy , so two photons at 532 nm are sufficient to ionize a rb atom  @xcite .",
    "this method permits ion creation directly from background vapor , at a specific time in the experimental cycle .",
    "however , in order to load the trap from vapor , it is required to keep the getter on , resulting in a deterioration of the vacuum in the chamber . a significant shot to shot variation , of the number of ions loaded into the ion trap , is seen in this case , irrespective of background gas or mot loading of the ion trap . + * method ( b ) * resonant tpi .",
    "the two photons for ionization here come from the mot laser ( 1.59 ev ) and the blue light source ( bls ) led ( peak at 2.72 ev ) used for atomic desorption of the atoms for loading the mot . since the mot lasers are either on resonance or only slightly detuned with respect to the atomic transition , this is resonant tpi .",
    "the sum of the energy carried by the red and the blue light is 4.31 ev , which is slightly higher than the ie for the rb atom .",
    "both the sources are continuous . in the absence of the mot ( magnetic field off ) , but mot beams and led on , no ions are captured into the ion trap from the residual gas vapor , though the tpi process is active in the region of overlap of the two frequencies . in order to load the ion trap efficiently , the loading of ions must happen through the mot atoms .",
    "the dominant ionization process is @xmath26 and thus the instantaneous velocity for the creation of the ion is almost zero .",
    "this method gives a steady loading rate of ions in the ion trap from the cooled mot atoms .",
    "the temporal overlap of the on phase of the ion trap along with the two light sources , loads the ion trap at a steady rate .",
    "since both the above ionization schemes create ions within the trap , the electrodes of the trap can be in full trapping configuration while the ionization is underway .",
    "this is in effect a strategy which enables the loading of the ion trap at its potential minimum .",

    "the agilent function generator is used in the burst mode which is activated using a trigger pulse .",
    "this allows the rf trapping fields to be switched on or off within a fraction of the rf cycle .",
    "axial confinement is provided by a positive voltage on the end - cap electrodes .",
    "the typical range of the parameters used for trapping ions are , 400 khz@xmath27 khz and @xmath28v , limited at the higher voltage and frequency values by the gain bandwidth product of the rf amplifier and @xmath29 v.    the prospects of fluorescence detection of the ions in the trap is compromised by the lack of convenient transitions , for the closed shell rb@xmath23 ion . however , in the event of a trapped optically active ion , for eg . a singly ionized alkaline earth atom , the optical access allowed by the experimental design permits fluorescent ion detection . for the present experiment",
    "though , only the destructive detection of the ions is implemented , using a cem ( dr.sjuts : kbl 10rs ) , which is located beyond the end - cap along the z direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptschematic ] .",
    "the cem is set up for positive ion detection and gives detectable ion signal for negative voltages greater than -1800 v at the cone of the cem .",
    "the tail of the cem is held at ground potential , enabling us to define v@xmath30 as the bias voltage of the cem .",
    "the ions are extracted onto the cem by switching the potential on the hollow ring end - cap electrode that is close to the cem , to a negative value , while keeping the opposite end - cap electrode constant and the rf of the ion trap in steady operation .",
    "the switching of the potential on the end - cap electrode is effected within one rf cycle . the trapped ions",
    "pass through the hollow center of the end - cap electrode and are attracted by the high voltage on the cem cone .",
    "both the pulse counting and the analog modes of cem operation give reliable ion signals . in the analog mode",
    "the cem signal is fed into a low noise preamplifier ( srs : sr570 ) , with set amplification , and is then recorded on a digital oscilloscope ( do ) . due to identical charge / mass ( e / m ) ratios for the trapped ions , all of the trapped ions impact the detector within a time interval of 10 - 20 @xmath0s , depending on the extraction voltage .",

    "is recorded on a do , and the pulses are counted by post - processing the pulse train using an appropriately set discriminator level ( dl ) .",
    "all instances , when the falling edge of the cem pulse train crosses the negative dl , are counted as valid counts , and signal which peaks below this level is rejected as noise . with this protocol",
    ", several ions piling up on top of each other ( within 8ns ) , would register as a single count . from a series of experiments ,",
    "we determine that @xmath32 counts @xmath33 @xmath0s is the limit of ions that can be counted .",
    "this implies a maximum counting rate of @xmath34 counts / s , which pushes cem detection to its very limit . as the ion counting",
    "is done with the recorded data train , the dl can be set very systematically as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cemdiscrl ] .",
    "the counts as a function of dl has identifiable regions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cemdiscrl ] , which allows the determination of a reasonable value of discriminator level for the analysis of the ion counts at a particular cem bias .",
    "this procedure is benchmarked against the physical counting of the peaks in several individual time traces to make the algorithm robust against over counting or under counting .",
    "a distinct advantage of this method of post analysis is that robust and consistent algorithms can be developed for pulse counting and data from several different runs can be analyzed in a uniform manner .",
    "v , the correspondence between the ions counted by the pulse counting algorithm and the analog mode signal . for 2 amplifier settings",
    "the ratio of the analog mode signal to the ion counts is plotted above .",
    "as the number of ions increases the signals are approximately constant and differ proportional to the amplifier factor .",

    "this has been experimentally investigated by tracking any change in the mot fluorescence as a function of applied rf and end - cap voltages .",
    "no detectable change is observed .",
    "in addition the mot lifetime is also unchanged in the presence of the rf fields indicating that there is no detectable heating of the mot by ion trap operation .    to summarize ,",
    "while the operation of the extra trap has the potential to affect the trapped ions or atoms , in the regime of the present experiment these inter trap effects can be generally neglected , without serious consequences .",
    "loading the ions from the cold atoms requires an experimental choice between the two ionization methods discussed above .",
    "it is experimentally found that the combination of cold atoms with the bls illumination builds the detectable ions in the ion trap at a steady rate . the formation of ions from the mot atoms is directly related to mot density over the mot volume .",
    "in addition , the frequency and intensity stability of light sources is uniform with time , and a multi - photon process with only one of the two light sources in operation is extremely improbable . on the other hand the nd :",
    "yag ionization suffers from many uncertainties .",
    "these include , shot to shot intensity fluctuation , uncertainty over the volume of ionization from the mot , the precise order of the multi - photon process resulting in ionization , etc .",
    "thus for all the ion atom combination experiments that follow , the ion trap is loaded from the mot atoms using resonant tpi .    .",
    "the axial direction represents the direction of weakest confinement for the ions .",
    "the ion counts are normalized to emphasize a fully loaded trap and an empty trap .",
    "the loading time is kept at 0.2 s so that the ions do not have too much time to interact with the cold atoms , while generating a reasonable ion number in the trap volume .",
    "an inverted gaussian is fitted to the data and is meant to guide the eye , width=7 ]    since the mot temperatures are of the order of @xmath49 @xmath0k range and the recoil imparted to the atom in the process of ionization small , the ion created from the mot has very little kinetic energy .",
    "however because the ions are created over the spatial extent of the mot , they can be created with significant potential energy depending on where in the trap potential and which time in the rf cycle they were ionized .",
    "for this reason it is prudent to keep the size of the mot small so that the ions are created in the close vicinity of the rf node . within these constraints",
    "a temperature measurement can be made for the ions loaded into the trap as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iontemp ] , which is made as follows . for the instance",
    "when @xmath50 v and @xmath51 khz and with @xmath6 set to a specific value between 0 and 10 v , the mot is loaded to saturation , the ion trap switched on for 0.2 seconds during which the the ion trap loads .",
    "after the 0.2 seconds of loading the end - cap voltages , are switched to their respective extraction values of @xmath6 and -5 v , and the ions extracted with the cycle repeating .",
    "several measurements are made for each end - cap trap voltage value for better statistics .",
    "[ fig : iontemp ] illustrates the variation of the ion counts with @xmath6 giving an indication of the temperature of creation of ions from the mot , in the hybrid trap . for trap depths below 1.5",
    "ev the ions start to leak out of the trap . while the present implementation of the trap temperature measurement is along the z direction , it is sufficient to determine the ion temperature .",
    "this is because for long hold times or with many ions present , ion - atom and ion - ion interaction will ensure equilibration . in what follows",
    "we discuss some experimental signatures of precisely this ion - atom interaction .    to investigate ion - atom interactions , a typical experiment is executed as follows .",
    "the mot starts loading , when the blue led is turned on at time @xmath52 , from the vapor in the vacuum system that is generated through liad , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motpionlandd ] .",
    "the ion trap end - caps are kept on while the rf is off .",
    "all the while the mot is loaded , the blue led is creating ions from the cold atoms by resonant tpi , as described earlier .",
    "however these are not trapped and escape the trap region instantly .",
    "once the mot is loaded to saturation , the rf is switched on at time @xmath53 , thus turning on the ion trap .",
    "immediately the ion trap starts loading resulting in ions and atoms trapped in the same volume .",
    "as soon as the trapped ions coexist with the trapped atoms , the mot fluorescence drops by @xmath54% as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : motpionlandd ] .",
    "the resonant tpi rate does not change with the switching on of the ion trap rf , as it depends only on the mot density , mot lasers and the blue light led being on simultaneously .",
    "the drop in fluorescence from the mot is a distinct signature of ion - atom interactions , between the mot atoms and the trapped ions .",
    "collisional interaction can be elastic and enhanced by resonant charge exchange between the mot atoms and the trapped ions , causing the loss of cold atoms from the mot .",
    "however , there also exists the possibility of molecule / molecular ion formation , due to the combination of ions , atoms and several different light fields being present all at once .",
    "the details of the loss mechanism will be explored in detail in future experiments .",
    "a few seconds after the rf is switched on , the blue light led is switched off ( @xmath55 ) , resulting in the general decay of the mot and the trapped ions .     to @xmath55 seconds",
    "is when the mot and the ion trap are simultaneously loaded .",
    "the resulting drop in the atomic fluorescence is clearly manifested . beyond @xmath55 , the mot and the ions in the ion trap",
    "are allowed to decay naturally .",
    "the vertical left axis indicates the total atom number loaded in the mot , arrived at by the procedure described earlier .",
    "the vertical right axis indicates the light level detected by the pmt.,width=7 ]    following the experimental signature of ion - atom interaction on the atom signal we demonstrate a corresponding signature in the ion signal . here",
    "we measure the lifetime of the ions in the ion trap , with and without an overlapping mot .",
    "for this experiment , the mot is loaded with the dispenser on and the bls is turned on for the ion trap loading time @xmath56 , from @xmath53 to @xmath55 . following the loading of ions at @xmath55 ,",
    "the number of ions as a function of hold time is measured , either in the presence of the constant mot or with the mot switched off at @xmath55 .",
    "the results of this experiment are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionlifecombin](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "ten independent measurements of ion number are performed at each hold time and the statistical uncertainty is one standard deviation .",
    "it is found that identical numbers of ions are held in the ion trap at @xmath55 . as the hold time increases , while the overall ion numbers in the trap decreases both with and without a mot , the number of ions in the trap with simultaneous mot is systematically higher on the average by @xmath57 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionlifecombin](b ) .     ions from the ion trap in the presence and absence of an overlapping mot .",
    "the mot is loaded from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , the ion trap is loaded for the time interval @xmath58 and beyond @xmath55 the mot is either held constant or switched off . (",
    "a ) illustrates the decay of ions from the ion trap as a function of hold time beyond @xmath55 in the presence of a constant mot ( black ) and without the mot ( gray ) .",
    "the inset in ( a ) is a zoom in for longer hold times . from ( a )",
    "it is clear that the number of ions held in the presence of the mot is systematically higher than without the mot .",
    "the ratio of the ion counts in the two cases is illustrated in ( b ) , where by 4.5 s of hold time the ratio of ions with mot to without mot has stabilized to @xmath59 . beyond 8.0 s",
    "the error bars are not shown in ( b ) as the statistical scatter in the ion number held without the mot goes below the mean value of the baseline count for the measurement and the ratio at 9 s is divided by 2 to avoid scale compression.,width=7 ]    finally we look at the stability of the ions in the ion trap , in the presence of the mot atoms , analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig : ionsfromvapor ] . here , the ions are loaded from the mot by resonant tpi for 510 ms and then extracted .",
    "the range of v@xmath60 values for which ions are seen is dramatically reduced as compared to when there are no cold atoms .",
    "a comparison of these two instances are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabionwatoms ] , where only the highest values of v@xmath60 support ion trapping in the presence of the mot atoms .",
    "this is in contrast with the relatively broad regions of trapping , for the same frequencies , in the absence of cold atoms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionsfromvapor ] .",
    "whether the narrowing is due to direct ion - atom collision is to be investigated in the future .",
    "khz is illustrated .",
    "the equivalent result with only ions is superimposed for comparison ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ionsfromvapor ] ) .",
    "the ions are created from cold atoms using resonant tpi .",
    "after the ionization part of the cycle , the ions are loaded into the trap from the mot for 510 ms , at a particular @xmath4 , and subsequently extracted to the cem .",
    "the ion numbers are normalized .",
    "the ion trap is found to work in a much narrower range of @xmath4 in the presence of cold atoms.,width=7 ]    thus we have demonstrated that both cold atoms and ions can be trapped simultaneously , and with spatial overlap .",
    "a few distinct signatures of the ion - atom interaction that results have been presented .",
    "this validates the instrument concept , design and the techniques employed here .",
    "below we discuss in brief the physics problems that can be addresses with such an instrument , which shall put the instrumentation effort in perspective .",
    "in conclusion , we have designed , built and characterized an apparatus that allows the simultaneous trapping of cold atoms , and ions .",
    "the focus of the manuscript has been to characterize in detail the unusual aspects of the present experiment and the innovations developed for this purpose .",
    "techniques that are standard have been dealt with only briefly , to the extent they serve to complete the picture .",
    "the range of experiments described cover the operation of individual traps , inter - trap perturbation , combined operation of the traps and the ion - atom interactions observed .",
    "the experiment described above opens up the possibilities of several investigations of ion - atom interactions over mk @xmath61 k temperatures .",
    "this can be done , as the ions created from the mot , can over time be cooled by the ultra - cold atoms .",
    "the atoms and ions can be loaded in their respective traps to steady state populations , i.e. trap saturation .",
    "questions such as ( a ) determination of the ion - atom collision cross sections as a function of temperature , ( b ) how to sympathetically crystallize ions , ( c ) what is the combined temperature of the ion - atom system  @xcite , etc , can be posed .",
    "in addition ( d ) what are the reaction products of of the ion - atom - photon soup , ( e ) is photo - association aided , ( f ) can macro - molecules be formed , and so on are other experiments possible .",
    "further , more than one species of ion and/or atom can be loaded simultaneously and the cross species processes can be studied , which would open up a larger canvas for exploration . in particular , we emphasize that these experiments can be done in steady state as the ion and atom numbers can be held constant , by loading their respective traps to saturation .",
    "our experiment therefore allows studies with large numbers of ions and atoms in a wide temperature range , with flexibility to increase the complexity in a straightforward manner .",
    "it might well be that such a system finds its principle utility as a ` test tube ' for low temperature processes , that does not depend on specific state addressing .",
    "it is for the future to reveal what emerges from this ` test tube ' .",
