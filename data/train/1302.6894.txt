    "in this paper we discuss efficient ways to model optically pumped atoms in a regime where velocity - selective optical pumping ( vsop ) is possible , but where collisional rates with buffer gases are too high to permit the use of models for cooling and trapping in the near absence of collisions .",
    "this is the regime of sodium guidestar atoms .",
    "these naturally - occurring layers of sodium atoms at altitudes of 90100  km above the earth s",
    "surface @xcite are illuminated by ground - based lasers , and the returning photons are used to measure the relative retardation of wave fronts across an optical aperture .",
    "this retardation information can be used with a deformable mirror to correct for the aberrations from atmospheric turbulence and to allow the receiving optics to produce a more nearly diffraction - limited image of astronomical objects .",
    "the performance of guidestar systems is limited by the loss of atoms from the most strongly backscattering spin sublevels and velocity groups .",
    "the most important reasons for these losses are : collisions with the residual atmospheric gases , which transfer atoms from strongly absorbing to weakly absorbing spin sublevels , or which shift the atoms into velocity groups that are not in resonance with the pumping light ; larmor precession of the spins away from strongly absorbing orientations if the geomagnetic field is not parallel to the direction of the laser beam ; and unwanted optical pumping into weakly absorbing sublevels .",
    "the powerful modeling methods discussed here make it easier to explore the parameter space of these processes and to optimize the performance of guidestar systems .",
    "these methods also provide a more realistic and numerically convenient way to model laboratory experiments with vsop of atoms in low - pressure buffer gases .",
    "in contrast to previous work on this topic , for example references @xcite , we account for the full hyperfine structure of real alkali - metal atoms , we show how to use spin - relaxation modes @xcite to incorporate into the model the complicated spin relaxation of na guidestar atoms due to collisions with paramagnetic oxygen atoms , and we use recently developed cusp kernels @xcite to realistically and efficiently model velocity - changing collisions .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ denmat ] , we introduce the liouville space of the coupled spin and velocity distributions of the atoms . in section [ spin ]",

    "the amplitudes @xmath3 of the spin modes in velocity space provide a complete description of the spin and velocity polarization of the atoms .",
    "the little - known liouville conjugate operation , denoted by the superscript @xmath4 , and the transposition operator @xmath5 for liouville - space operators are discussed in section [ spinb ] .",
    "using liouville conjugates reduces the numerical computing requirements by nearly a factor of 2 .    in section [ velocity ]",
    "we show how to describe velocity distributions with velocity - relaxation modes @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we use the velocity modes to show that a simple transformation of the widely used keilson - storer kernels @xcite leads to much more realistic and useful cusp kernels @xcite for describing velocity - changing collisions . in section [ pressure ]",
    "we present a simple model for the transition from collision - free , ballistic flight to any container walls at very low buffer - gas pressure to diffusional wall losses at higher pressure .",
    "we sketch how the relative sizes of the laser beam and the cell affect these processes . in an appendix",
    "we show how to deduce the rate of velocity - changing collisions , @xmath7 from the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath8 and the smallest - nonzero eigenvalue @xmath9 of the collision operator @xmath10 with the little - known formula ( [ sd80 ] ) . in ( [ rid16 ] ) of section [ dark ]",
    ", we show that spin - changing and velocity - changing collisions cause the spin - mode amplitudes @xmath3 to relax exponentially in time at the rate @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is a kernel in velocity space .    in section [ pumping ]",
    ", we introduce a velocity - dependent optical pumping operator @xmath12 , which we write as the sum of poles in the complex - velocity plane at locations determined by the laser frequency and the optical bohr frequencies .",
    "the pole expansion facilitates velocity averages in terms of faddeeva functions ( voigt profiles ) @xcite .",
    "the poles have `` residue matrices '' that are independent of the laser frequency and atomic velocity . in section viii , we show that the steady - state mode amplitudes @xmath3 generated by the combined effects of optical pumping , spin relaxation , and velocity relaxation can be written in terms of green s functions , @xmath13 .",
    "we show that if the kernel @xmath11 is a cusp kernel or linear combination thereof , @xmath14 is also cusp kernel or linear combination thereof .",
    "being able to invert cusp kernels in closed form greatly simplifies the numerical evaluation of the mode amplitudes @xmath3 .",
    "this simplification is not possible with keilson - storer kernels or any other collision kernel that we know of .",
    "we present an explicit , series solution ( [ ss2 ] ) for the mode amplitudes @xmath3 in powers of the pumping light intensity , with particular emphasis on the first - order solution ( [ sr10 ] ) .    finally , in section ix , we use ( [ sr10 ] ) to demonstrate how the methods we present are in excellent agreement with existing vsop experiments .",
    "we also describe a new type of magnetic - depolarization experiment that can be carried out under laboratory conditions and readily interpreted with the powerful modeling methods described in this paper .",
    "such experiments would provide much more detailed experimental information about the nature of velocity - changing collisions .",

    "the diffusion coefficient is very nearly half the value of the sharpness , which is intuitively reasonable since sharp kernels represent velocity damping dominated by grazing - incidence collisions , which do little to hinder spatial diffusion . using the unit of length @xmath418 and unit of time @xmath419 to convert the dimensionless diffusion coefficient ( [ sd14 ] ) to dimensional units ( cm@xmath35s@xmath207 for cgs units ) we find ( [ sd80 ] ) .",

    "<S> we present efficient theoretical tools for describing the optical pumping of atoms by light propagating at arbitrary directions with respect to an external magnetic field , at buffer - gas pressures that are small enough for velocity - selective optical pumping ( vsop ) but large enough to cause substantial collisional relaxation of the velocities and the spin . </S>",
    "<S> these are the conditions for the sodium atoms at an altitude of about 100  km that are used as guidestars for adaptive optics in modern ground - based telescopes to correct for aberrations due to atmospheric turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we use spin and velocity relaxation modes to describe the distribution of atoms in spin space ( including both populations and coherences ) and velocity space . </S>",
