    "the so - called hegselmann - krause bounded confidence model ( hk - model for brevity ) , introduced in @xcite , is one of the most popular mathematical models for the dynamics of opinion formation in groups of interacting agents . in its classical formulation",
    ", we have a finite number @xmath0 of agents , indexed by the integers @xmath1 .",
    "time is measured discretely and the opinion of agent @xmath2 at time @xmath3 is represented by a real number @xmath4 .",
    "there is a fixed parameter @xmath5 such that the dynamics are given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 . in words , at each time step an agent takes account of his so - called _",
    "@xmath8-neighbourhood _ , consisting of those other agents",
    "whose opinions currently lie within distance @xmath8 of his own .",
    "he updates his opinion to the average of those held by the members of his @xmath8-neighbourhood , including himself .    in purely formal terms",
    ", the model makes sense if opinions @xmath4 are assumed to come from a set @xmath9 which has enough structure so that it is possible to make sense of the command to +    _ ` move to the average of a finite collection of points within distance @xmath8 of your present location'_. +   + we shall refer to any rigorous formulation of this procedure as a _ hk - update rule_. the simplest generalisation would be to @xmath10 for any @xmath11 and with the euclidean metric .",
    "this is natural if we imagine that there are @xmath12 ` issues ' on which agents have opinions , and they are only willing to compromise with those whose opinions on _ every _ issue are sufficiently close to their own .",
    "there are rigorous results in the literature concerning the hk - dynamics in euclidean space of arbitrary dimension , see for example @xcite .",
    "note , though , that it is not clear what is the most natural formulation of the hk - dynamics in @xmath10 for @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the @xmath14-metric may better capture the notion that an agent will only compromise with those whose opinions on all issues are close to their own  indeed , the @xmath15-metric seems better suited when considering the hk - dynamics as a rendezvous procedure , as in for example @xcite . however , it is also plausible that the hk - update rule is too strict a criterion for compromise .",
    "at least one group of authors @xcite has suggested a more general model in which there is a second parameter @xmath16 such that one agent will compromise with another whose opinions on at least @xmath17 of the @xmath12 issues are within a fixed distance of his own .",
    "note that , in this generality , we are no longer dealing with a hk - update rule , as formulated above , since if @xmath18 then the ` distance ' between agents does not satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "if we want to stick with the hk - update rule , then perhaps the simplest and most natural example to consider after euclidean space is a circle .",
    "let @xmath19 denote a circle of perimeter @xmath20 , equipped with its natural metric which we will denote by @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 then the ` average location of those in your @xmath8-neighbourhood ' is not well - defined , unless there is a priori agreement on an orientation of the circle and an origin , i.e. : on a continuous bijection from @xmath19 to @xmath23 . in any case , if such a priori agreement existed , then the dynamics would become trivial as any configuration would collapse immediately to a complete consensus .",
    "the circle is also uninteresting if @xmath24 , since then there must be a pair of consecutive agents at distance greater than @xmath8 apart , so the configuration evolves as if it were living on the real line , with these two agents as the extreme opinions .",
    "hence , when studying the circle , we may assume that @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , without loss of generality we can fix @xmath26 and have @xmath27 $ ] as the only variable parameter .",
    "there are at least two possible motivations for considering the hk - dynamics on a circle :    a.   firstly , it is possible to think of ` real - life ' situations where it makes more sense to consider opinions as lying on a circle instead of the real line .",
    "for example , the subject under debate may be the choice of a time of day or date on which to hold some event .",
    "b.   secondly , the circle is perhaps the simplest example of a space on which the hk - dynamics behave differently from in euclidean space in a fundamental sense which we now describe .",
    "it is a well - known fact that , in euclidean space , any configuration of opinions obeying the dynamics in ( [ eq : update ] ) will freeze in finite time , that is , there will be some @xmath28 such that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in fact , it is known that the time taken to freeze is bounded above by a universal polynomial function of the number @xmath0 of agents . in one dimension ,",
    "the best bound to date is @xmath32 , proven independently in @xcite and @xcite . in higher dimensions , the best published bound @xcite is @xmath33 , but a recent preprint @xcite improves this to @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , in a frozen configuration in @xmath10 , agents must either _ agree _ , that is @xmath35 , or be beyond each other s influence , that is @xmath36 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if on the circle we place @xmath37 agents at angles @xmath38 , @xmath39 , then we have a frozen configuration in which no proper subset of the agents is isolated from its complement , but nor are any two agents in agreement",
    ". there also exist frozen configurations with these properties in which agents are not equally spaced .",
    "it is easy to see that any such configuration must include at least @xmath40 agents , and that the only example with @xmath40 agents , modulo translations , is that in figure [ fig : stable ] below .",
    "furthermore , on the circle there are configurations which never freeze .",
    "for example , if we perturb the configuration in figure [ fig : stable ] by a sufficiently small amount then we will obtain one starting from which we never freeze , since the updated configurations will converge back to that in figure [ fig : stable ] , possibly translated , at an exponential rate .",
    "see remark [ rem:4points ] below for a proof of this last statement .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us formally define the term _ convergence _ for a finite set of agents obeying the hk - dynamics on a circle :    [ defi : converge ] let @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 , the latter equipped with the product topology .",
    "suppose that , for all @xmath44 , the vectors @xmath45 are defined inductively by the hk - update rule , with @xmath46 .",
    "if , for some @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 in the product topology , then the sequence of configurations @xmath49 is said to _ converge _ to @xmath50 .",
    "it is common to abuse terminology slightly and say that the initial configuration @xmath51 converges to @xmath50 .    in @xcite",
    "it is stated as an open problem for @xmath19 whether any initial configuration will converge .",
    "the only other explicit mention of this problem that we could find is in @xcite and , as far as we know , it has remained open up to now .",
    "our first main result gives a positive answer :    [ thm : converge ] for any @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath52 , the sequence @xmath53 defined by the hk - update rule converges .",
    "the proof of this result will be given in the next section .",
    "it requires only moderate variations on ideas already presented in the literature when studying the hk - model in euclidean space .",
    "two important and well - known concepts are involved .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "firstly , we define the _ energy _ of the configuration @xmath55 as @xmath56 secondly , we define the _ influence graph _ @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath55 to be the undirected graph whose vertices are @xmath58 and where an edge is placed between @xmath2 and @xmath59 if and only if @xmath60 . given an orientation of the circle , we can also define a _ directed influence graph _ @xmath61 by choosing the oriented pair @xmath62 if and only if the shortest path from @xmath2 to @xmath59 follows the orientation .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : converge ] consists of two main parts .",
    "firstly , we show that an application of the hk - update rule always decreases the energy of a configuration , by an amount which is bounded below in terms of @xmath63 .",
    "a similar result has been rediscovered several times over for euclidean space , the earliest reference we could find is theorem 2 of @xcite . our proof for the circle is almost identical to that for euclidean space given in theorem 4.3 of @xcite .",
    "secondly , we show that if the digraphs @xmath64 and @xmath65 are different , that is , if at least one edge has been either added , deleted or changed orientation at time @xmath66 , then the sum of the decreases in energy at times @xmath66 and @xmath67 is bounded below by @xmath68 . since the initial energy is at most @xmath69 , this implies that the digraph @xmath70 can change at most @xmath71 times and , in particular , must be fixed from some @xmath66 onwards .",
    "once we know this , convergence will follow from standard linear algebra arguments .",
    "our reasoning in the second part of the proof also closely resembles known arguments for euclidean space , though the latter all seem to appeal at some point to the fact that the points of @xmath72 all lie inside the convex hull of those in @xmath49 .",
    "there is no analogous fact for the circle , which gives the argument a new twist .",
    "the final proof of convergence , although it only appeals to basic linear algebra , also has no direct counterpart in euclidean space since configurations always freeze eventually in the latter .",
    "+   + in section 3 , we will prove another result .",
    "given that freezing occurs in euclidean space after a time which is bounded by a universal polynomial function of the number @xmath0 of agents and given that , on the circle , the directed influence graph changes at most a polynomial - in-@xmath0 number of times , it is natural to ask whether freezing of the latter must also happen within a time which is bounded by a polynomial function of @xmath0 only .",
    "this turns out not to be the case .",
    "we shall prove that , for all sufficiently large @xmath0 and any @xmath73 , there is a choice of perimeter @xmath20 and a configuration of @xmath0 agents whose influence digraph remains the same up to time @xmath74 but eventually changes .",
    "indeed , we can choose the configuration so that @xmath70 is strongly connected all the way around the circle until the first change occurs , at which point a pair of adjacent agents become disconnected in the underlying graph and the configuration subsequently collapses to a complete consensus after three additional time steps .",
    "section 4 discusses some remaining open problems .",
    "the first step in the proof is to show that the hk - dynamics decrease the energy of a configuration as defined in ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "the proof of the following result involves only minor modifications from that of theorem 4.3 in @xcite , but we will present it for the sake of completeness .    [",
    "prop : nrj ] if the sequence of configurations @xmath53 obeys the hk - update rule then , for any @xmath75 , @xmath76    fix an ( anti - clockwise ) orientation and an origin of @xmath19 , i.e. : a suitable bijection @xmath77 . in",
    "what follows we shall often not distinguish in writing between a point @xmath78 and its image @xmath79 - hopefully , it will always be clear form the context which is being referred to .    for each @xmath80 ,",
    "let @xmath81^n$ ] be the vector such that @xmath82 note that ( [ eq : minsk ] ) can be written in the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the euclidean norm on @xmath85 .    for every @xmath86 set @xmath87",
    "we write @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "define functions @xmath90 as follows : @xmath91 where , if @xmath92 and @xmath93 , then @xmath94 clearly the functions @xmath95 are symmetric , i.e. : @xmath96 , and @xmath97 it is easy to see that the function @xmath98 is strictly convex on @xmath85 and attains its global minimum at @xmath99 .",
    "hence if we define @xmath100 by @xmath101 then @xmath102 it is also clear that @xmath103 is a convex second - degree polynomial in @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus it must have the form @xmath106 in particular , @xmath107 which means that @xmath108 secondly , we claim that @xmath109 note that ( [ eq : ineq2 ] ) , ( [ eq : ineq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ee ] ) would together imply ( [ eq : norminsk ] ) . to prove ( [ eq : ineq2 ] ) we simply note that , on the one hand , if @xmath30 then @xmath110 while , if @xmath111 , then it is easily verified that @xmath112 together ( [ eq : ineq4 ] ) and ( [ eq : ineq3 ] ) imply ( [ eq : ineq2 ] ) , so the proof of the proposition is complete .",
    "the second step in the proof of theorem [ thm : converge ] is to establish a lower bound on the decrease in energy resulting from any change in the directed influence graph .",
    "[ prop : graph ] let @xmath44 and suppose that @xmath113 . then , with notation as in ( [ eq : delta ] ) , @xmath114 then a priori at least one of the following four things must have happened at time @xmath66 :    a.   some agent , @xmath115 say , has a new neighbour @xmath116 to his right . in other words ,",
    "the oriented edge @xmath117 is in @xmath70 but not in @xmath64 .",
    "note that it could still be the case ( if @xmath118 ) that @xmath119 , it will not matter for the argument we present below .",
    "b.   some agent @xmath115 has a new neighbour @xmath116 to his left . c.   some agent @xmath115 has a lost a neighbour @xmath116 on his right .",
    "d.   some agent @xmath115 has lost a neighbour @xmath116 on his left .",
    "we suppose that ( i ) occurs - analogous arguments can be given in each of the other three cases .",
    "pick an oriented edge @xmath117 which is added at time @xmath66 .",
    "if either of these agents moved a distance of at least @xmath120 at step @xmath66 , then @xmath121 and we are done . otherwise , the distance between these two agents at time @xmath66 is still at least @xmath122 .",
    "now agent @xmath115 will draw agent @xmath116 to the left ( i.e. : clockwise ) at step @xmath67 .",
    "if agent @xmath116 were to move a distance of at least @xmath120 to the left at step @xmath67 then we would be done again .",
    "but since @xmath116 gained a neighbour to his left at time @xmath66 and since the ordering of agents around the circle is always preserved by the hk - dynamics , he can not have lost any neighbours to his left at time @xmath66 .",
    "hence , there are only two possible ways he can be prevented from moving at least @xmath120 to his left at time @xmath67 :    a.   there is some @xmath123 such that the oriented edge @xmath124 is also added to the digraph at time @xmath66 , or b.   the neighbours of @xmath116 at time @xmath125 , including himself , move on average sufficiently far to the right at time @xmath66 to compensate for the appearance of @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the total net movement to the right of these neighbours at time @xmath66 . then",
    ", since @xmath116 has certainly no more than @xmath0 neighbours at time @xmath66 and since @xmath115 is such a neighbour , his movement to the left at time @xmath67 is bounded below by @xmath127 .",
    "thus @xmath128 .",
    "since @xmath116 has at most @xmath129 neighbours at time @xmath125 , by the cauchy - schwarz inequality the sum of their contributions to @xmath130 is at least @xmath131 , which is greater than @xmath68 for all @xmath132 .",
    "thus we are done again unless ( a ) occurs .",
    "now we can apply the same analysis to the pair @xmath124 and so on . for the proposition to fail",
    ", we would have to have an infinite , anti - clockwise sequence of agents @xmath133 such that each oriented edge @xmath134 appeared at time @xmath66 .",
    "but this would mean that , for every @xmath12 , agent @xmath135 moved further to the left than @xmath136 at time @xmath66 .",
    "since there are only finitely many agents , this is impossible .",
    "_ of theorem [ thm : converge]_. the energy of a configuration of @xmath0 agents is certainly no more than @xmath69",
    ". hence , if the sequence of configurations @xmath53 obeys the hk - update rule , it follows from propositions [ prop : nrj ] and [ prop : graph ] that there are at most @xmath71 values of @xmath66 for which @xmath137 .",
    "thus it suffices to prove theorem [ thm : converge ] under the assumption that the directed influence graph @xmath138 is the same for all time .",
    "furthermore , we may assume that the underlying graph @xmath139 is connected , as otherwise the dynamics are the same as for a configuration on the real line , in which case we know it will freeze in finite time .",
    "once again , let us fix a choice of a suitable bijection @xmath140 .",
    "the map @xmath141 induces an ordering of the components of any @xmath142 .",
    "let us assume that , for our initial configuration @xmath143 , we have @xmath144 . then , since the hk - dynamics will never cause agents to cross , for all @xmath66 the agents @xmath145 will retain an anti - clockwise ordering , even though their ordering with respect to @xmath141 may be cyclically shifted .",
    "let @xmath146 denote the set of probability vectors in @xmath85 , i.e. : @xmath147 .",
    "then there is a natural map @xmath148 defined by @xmath149 since the directed influence graph is fixed , there is a fixed @xmath150 real matrix @xmath151 such that the dynamics satisfy @xmath152    by proposition [ prop : nrj ] , we know that the differences @xmath153 tend to @xmath154 as @xmath155 . hence , letting @xmath156 , we have @xmath157 hence , @xmath158 must be identically zero in those coordinates corresponding to each block in the jordan normal form of @xmath151 whose eigenvalue is at least one in absolute value .",

    "this establishes convergence of the sequence @xmath53 , in the sense of definition 1.1 .",
    "[ rem : irreda ] an alternative argument for obtaining ( [ eq : xinfty ] ) is as follows . it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath151 in ( [ eq : distdyn ] ) has non - negative entries .",
    "we claim that @xmath151 is column - stochastic .",
    "to prove this , it suffices to prove that @xmath167 by definition , ( [ eq : ones ] ) holds for @xmath168 and any @xmath66 .",
    "now let @xmath158 be any probability vector .",
    "the transformation @xmath169 describes an updating of a configuration of @xmath0 agents , possibly involving a cyclic shift of the agents indices .",
    "this may not coincide with the hk - update rule for this configuration as there is no guarantee that agents interact precisely with those within unit distance of themselves .",
    "however , exactly the same pairs of agents interact as would be the case if the configuration were some @xmath49 . in particular",
    ", this means that the anti - clockwise ordering of agents will be preserved ( no agents will cross ) , which implies that @xmath170 will also be a probability vector .",
    "thus ( [ eq : ones ] ) holds for any probability vector , and hence for any @xmath171 .",
    "now @xmath151 may not be regular , since there may be pairs of agents that have exactly the same neighbours in @xmath138 at @xmath172 .",
