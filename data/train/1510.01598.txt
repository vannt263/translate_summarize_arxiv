    "pion photoproduction on nucleons has been the focus of many theoretical studies in the past years  @xcite .",
    "more specifically the neutral channels are particularly interesting , as their total cross sections are much smaller than for the charged channels , and there are big discrepancies between the models and data  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that , when using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) models it is therefore very important to take into account not only tree - level , but also loop - diagram contributions , as the lower - order contributions show very strong cancellations between amplitude pieces  @xcite .    by obtaining data for higher energies",
    "@xcite , it became clear that also this approach is not sufficient to describe the right convergence , even at energies of about only 20  mev above threshold .",
    "a possible solution that was performed in  @xcite is studying higher - order contributions , i.e. going to @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately this was not sufficient to reproduce the empirical behaviour , neither in the heavy - baryon quasi - static approach nor in the fully relativistical one .",
    "another suggestion to solve the discrepancy , which we study here , is to consider the contributions coming from the @xmath1 resonance  @xcite .",
    "its effect is small close to pion production threshold , but when approaching the resonance s mass one would expect it to lead to an important modification of the cross - section s behaviour  @xcite .",
    "a first such study has already been performed in  @xcite , which is a calculation up to chiral order @xmath3 . there",
    "it has been shown that , although no new fitting constants are introduced , the convergence between model and data is very good , even at energies higher than 200  mev .    here",
    "we study the low - energy constants .",
    "they are taken as fitting parameters and their convergence to the literature values is tested .",
    "furthermore , we propose the inclusion of the next possible set of loop diagrams .",
    "it corresponds to an order @xmath4 calculation when following the counting of  @xcite , which is reasonable for photon energies sufficiently below the @xmath1 resonance mass .",
    "the goal is to study the effect of this higher order on the modelling of polarization observables , which is expected to be small if the theory is convergent and the power counting consistent .",
    "we study the process in a fully covariant chpt calculation , including nucleons , pions , photons and the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "the power - counting scheme we use is the @xmath6 expansion introduced in  @xcite , where the small parameter @xmath7 is treated as being of order @xmath8 .",
    "so being , the diagrams are ordered by the rule @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the order of the diagram , @xmath11 the number of loops , @xmath12 the number of vertices of a specific order @xmath13 , and the @xmath14 are the three propagators of the respective hadrons . following this counting scheme , for a calculation up to @xmath15 we need the following pieces of the nucleonic lagrangian : @xmath16 \\right)\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } \\\\ \\nonumber&+\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{i}}{2m}\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}\\left(d_8\\text{tr}\\left[\\tilde f_{\\mu\\nu}^+u_\\alpha\\right ]   + d_9\\text{tr}\\left[f_{\\mu\\nu}^+ \\right]u_\\alpha \\right)+\\text{h.c.}\\right ) \\mathrm{d}_\\beta \\\\   & + \\frac{\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_5}{2}\\left ( d_{16}\\text{tr}\\left[\\chi_+\\right]u_\\mu   + \\mathrm{i}d_{18}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_5[\\mathrm{d}_\\mu,\\chi_- ] \\right ) \\bigg\\}\\psi+\\dots , \\label{eqlag12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definitions of  @xcite . while the low - energy constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are already well determined at the order at which they appear , corrections to their values",
    "are expected when moving to higher orders and including the @xmath1 resonance . as for the @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", they are mainly sensitive to the pion production processes , as they represent the third - order contact term .",
    "fitting them to our model is therefore an important study of their values .",
    "finally , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 have already been thoroughly studied in  @xcite in the same chpt approach , degrees of freedom and renormalization as in the present work .",
    "therefore , it would be extremely interesting to compare the fitting results of these two works .",
    "the inclusion of the degrees of freedom of the isospin-3/2 @xmath24 quadruplet requires the additional lagrangian terms @xmath25 with the definitions in  @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are very well studied and we do nt expect them to change in our fits . as for @xmath29 ,",
    "it is still not too well known , so we can leave it as a free fitting parameter .    with the help of the feynman rules extracted from these lagrangians , one can now calculate all the amplitudes of the diagrams entering this channel at the considered order , shown in figs .",
    "[ fdiag12 ] and  [ fdiag32 ] .",
