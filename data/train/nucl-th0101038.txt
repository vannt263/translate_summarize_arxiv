    ". indeed , coincidence @xmath10 measurements at quasielastic kinematics have provided over the years detailed information on the energies , momentum distributions and spectroscopic factors of bound nucleons .",
    "this is so because at quasielastic kinematics the @xmath10 reaction can be treated with confidence in the impulse approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , assuming that the detected knockout proton absorbs the whole momentum ( @xmath11 ) and energy ( @xmath12 ) of the exchanged photon ( for recent reviews of the subject see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . until recently most data were concentrated in the low missing momentum range @xmath13 mev / c , where @xmath14 is the recoil momentum of the residual nucleus . in the last years  @xcite higher",
    "@xmath14-regions are being probed at small missing energies @xmath15 to study further aspects of bound nucleon dynamics and nucleon currents .",
    "a substantial amount of theoretical work on @xmath10 has been carried out on the basis of nonrelativistic approximations to the nucleon current .",
    "this is the case of the standard distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia )  @xcite that uses a nonrelativistic approximation to the nucleon current operator and wave functions .",
    "dwia has been successfully used over the years  @xcite to analyze @xmath10 data using bound and scattered proton wave functions deduced from phenomenological nonrelativistic potentials .",
    "the limits of validity of the nonrelativistic dwia approach are now being studied by meucci , giusti and pacati  @xcite , among others .    in past years we investigated  @xcite nuclear responses and differential cross - sections for exclusive quasielastic electron scattering within the framework of relativistic mean field approximations . in the relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( rdwia)@xcite the one - body nucleon current , @xmath16",
    "is calculated with relativistic @xmath17 and @xmath18 wave functions for initial bound and final outgoing nucleons , respectively , and with relativistic nucleon current operator , @xmath19 .",
    "the bound state wave function is a four - spinor with well - defined parity and angular momentum quantum numbers , and is obtained by solving the dirac equation with scalar - vector ( s - v ) potentials determined through a hartree procedure from a relativistic lagrangian with scalar and vector meson terms  @xcite .",
    "the wave function for the outgoing proton is a solution of the dirac equation containing s - v global optical potentials  @xcite for a nucleon scattered with asymptotic momentum @xmath20 .",
    "dirac equations for both scattered and bound wave functions are solved in coordinate space and their solutions are then transformed to momentum space where necessary .",
    "( 1 ) sets up the scenario where differences between rdwia and dwia are at play .",
    "to go from the relativistic to the nonrelativistic approach the one - body ( @xmath21 matrix ) current operator is first of all expanded in a basis of free nucleon plane waves .",
    "this amounts to a truncation of the nucleon propagator that ignores negative energy solutions of the free dirac equation .",
    "next , a pauli reduction  @xcite is made to transform the current operator into a @xmath22 matrix , and an expansion in powers of @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the nucleon mass ) is made  @xcite . finally the transition nucleon current is calculated as the matrix element between bispinorial , nonrelativistic bound ( @xmath26 ) and scattered ( @xmath27 ) wave functions instead of the 4-component @xmath17 , @xmath18 wave functions .",
    "we then cast relativistic effects into :    \\i ) _ kinematical_. these are effects due to the truncation of the current operator to first , or higher order in @xmath28 , @xmath29 . for moderate @xmath28 values",
    "the relativized form proposed in @xcite gives proper account of such effects .",
    "\\ii ) _ dynamical_. these are effects due to the differences between relativistic and nonrelativistic wave functions which depend not only on the 4-spinor versus 2-spinor structure , but also on the potentials used in the respective dirac and schrdinger equations for the bound and scattered nucleon .",
    "salient features of dynamical effects are : a ) a dynamical depression of the upper component of the scattered nucleon wave function in the nuclear interior , typically identified as the effect of the darwin term coming from the derivative of the optical s  v potentials  @xcite .",
    "b ) a dynamical enhancement of the lower components , mainly that of the bound nucleon wave function .    so far , we applied successfully rdwia to @xmath30pb and @xmath31ca at low @xmath32  @xcite , and to @xmath33o at high @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the effect caused by the nonlocal darwin term for @xmath31ca and @xmath30pb cases was studied in detail in refs .",
    "the darwin term causes an apparent enhanced absorption when comparing the rdwia differential cross - section to the dwia one at moderate @xmath14 values , thus predicting larger spectroscopic factors  @xcite . for larger missing momentum values ( @xmath34 )",
    "the lower components of the relativistic wave functions start to play a more important role , enhancing the higher momentum components of the nucleon wave functions . in previous work",
    "@xcite we found that rdwia calculations , compared to standard dwia , tend to produce lower cross sections at @xmath13 mev / c and larger cross - sections at @xmath35 mev / c , improving agreement  @xcite with experiment .",
    "the effect of the dynamical enhancement of the lower components was studied in rpwia in refs .",
    "it was also studied in rdwia in ref .",
    "@xcite at high @xmath32 . in both cases",
    "it was found to play a crucial role in the @xmath36 responses .",
    "recent data  @xcite on @xmath33o at high @xmath32 seem to confirm former rdwia predictions .",
    "in particular , the richness shown by the structure of the @xmath3 asymmetry , which is different for @xmath4 and @xmath5 shells , is only consistent with predictions of relativistic calculations that include the dynamical enhancement of the lower components of bound dirac spinors .",
    "moreover , recent data on polarization observables in @xmath37c at @xmath38 ( gev / c)@xmath2 also agree nicely with rdwia analysis  @xcite .    for @xmath33o there is an important controversy in the comparison of theory to data at low @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to the data sets from 1@xmath39-shell proton knockout experiments on @xmath33o performed at saclay  @xcite and nikhef  @xcite in various kinematics in late 80s / early 90 s .",
    "these experiments measured the cross - section as a function of missing momentum and , in particular chinitz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and spaltro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , extracted also the @xmath36 response and @xmath3 asymmetry at @xmath40 ( gev / c)@xmath2 and @xmath41 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , respectively . the measurements from chinitz _ et al .",
    "_ were compared to relativistic  @xcite and nonrelativistic  @xcite dwia calculations showing relatively small deviations from theory . on the other hand , the data of spaltro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were compared to results from standard nonrelativistic dwia calculations , and were found to be far from theory . using nonrelativistic optical potential parameters by schwandt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and spectroscopic factors fitted to data in parallel kinematics , spaltro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the experimental @xmath42 is enhanced by a factor @xmath43 for the @xmath44 shell and by a factor @xmath45 for the @xmath46 .    though the large discrepancy between dwia results and experiment found by spaltro _",
    "_ may in part be due to two - body currents , calculations of exchange current effects are still contradictory  @xcite .",
    "hence , the controversy surrounding the @xmath36 response and asymmetry data still persists . in view of forthcoming information on @xmath6 responses from experiments at jefferson lab in the near future , it is important to reexamine these sets of data with rdwia calculations .",
    "we investigate whether a systematic fully relativistic analysis of the @xmath10 data at low @xmath32 may explain the apparent discrepancies between data from saclay  @xcite and nikhef  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we summarize the basic formalism needed to describe coincidence electron scattering reactions , paying special attention to the relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) .",
    "section iii contains the theoretical results obtained and their comparison with the experimental data . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "the general formalism for exclusive electron scattering reactions has been presented in detail in several previous papers .",
    "we refer in particular to refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we just summarize the kinematics and focus on those aspects that are of relevance to the points under discussion in this paper . as a guide to the reader",
    "we write down the unpolarized cross - section in born approximation assuming plane waves for the incoming and outgoing electron ( treated in the extreme relativistic limit ) ,    @xmath47 \\ ; , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the energy and solid angle corresponding to the scattered electron and @xmath50 is the solid angle for the outgoing proton .",
    "the factor @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 , with @xmath20 the momentum carried by the ejected proton and @xmath53 its energy .",
    "the term @xmath54 is the usual recoil factor @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the momentum and energy of the residual nucleus , respectively .",
    "the kinematical factors are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , where @xmath12 and @xmath63 are the energy and momentum transfer in the reaction and @xmath64 the electron scattering angle .",
    "the above factors , that contain the dependence on the electron kinematics , coincide with those given in  @xcite except for a factor @xmath65 in the interference @xmath36 term .",
    "we remark that in refs .",
    "@xcite a different convention for @xmath51 was used ( see for instance eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which amounts to a factor @xmath66 of the responses presented in this work with respect to the ones displayed in  @xcite .",
    "our calculation of differential cross - sections and responses includes also the effect of coulomb distortion of the incoming and outgoing electron waves .",
    "this breaks the simplicity of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , which is however still useful as a guide .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath33o coulomb distortion effects in the electron wave functions are tiny ( less than 1.5% effect on the cross - section ) .",
    "the hadronic current enters only in the response functions @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the longitudinal and transverse projections of the nuclear current with respect to the momentum transfer @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "note that the response functions can be separated by performing measurements with different kinematical factors @xmath71 and/or values of the azimuthal angle @xmath27 , while keeping the momentum and energy transfer constant .",
    "the response @xmath42 is obtained from differential cross - sections at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , both in theory and in experiment .",
    "experimental data for the cross - section are often presented in terms of _ reduced cross - sections _ or _ effective momentum distributions _",
    "@xmath74 , obtained by integrating over a particular missing energy peak the differential cross - section divided by @xmath75 . thus @xmath74 is defined by , @xmath76    the free electron - proton cross - section , @xmath77 , is usually taken as @xmath78 of de forest  @xcite .",
    "one must be aware that the cross - section given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) has a strong dependence in the kinematical variables via @xmath51 and @xmath77 which is removed in the reduced cross - section .",
    "for instance , at the kinematics of the experiment of chinitz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath79 mev , @xmath40 ( mev / c)@xmath2 and @xmath80 mev ) a small variation of 5 mev in @xmath81 and @xmath12 ( keeping @xmath15 and @xmath14 constant ) , may change the cross - section by as much as 7% and the reduced cross - section by less than 2% . in order to minimize kinematical dependences , it is safer to determine spectroscopic factors by scaling the theory to data on reduced cross sections rather than to data on cross - sections .",
    "this is so because experimentally , a folding and average of the cross - sections , responses and/or reduced cross - sections is performed over the experimental acceptance , and central values for the kinematical variables are quoted .",
    "theoretical calculations are done for the quoted central values . due to this , it is not unusual that spectroscopic factors may depend on whether one chooses to set the scale by comparing to reduced cross - sections or to differential cross - sections , or even to separate responses . in this work",
    "we first derive the spectroscopic factor ( @xmath82 ) from the reduced cross - section data .",
    "then we use this same factor to compare to data for the individual responses . in this way",
    "the analysis of @xmath42 and other responses is more consistent and meaningful .",
    "another quantity also obtained by the experimentalists and discussed in next section is the asymmetry @xmath3 given by @xmath83 one can see from eq .",
    "( 2 ) that this observable is closely related to @xmath42 , with the advantage that it is free from the scale factor ambiguity .      in rdwia",
    "the process is described  @xcite in terms of the one - body nucleon current given in eq .",
    "( [ nucc ] ) .",
    "the relativistic bound nucleon wave function , @xmath17 , is a four - spinor with well defined angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath84 , @xmath85 , corresponding to the shell under consideration . in coordinate space",
    "it is given by : @xmath86 which is eigenstate of total angular momentum with eigenvalue @xmath87 ,    @xmath88    with @xmath89 if @xmath90 and @xmath91 if @xmath92 .",
    "the functions @xmath93 satisfy the usual coupled linear differential equations  @xcite .",
    "the wave function for the outgoing proton , @xmath18 , is a scattering solution of the dirac equation , which includes s  v global optical potentials .",
    "this wave function is obtained as a partial wave expansion in configuration space  @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 are four - spinors of the same form as that in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . the phase - shifts and radial functions are complex because of the complex potential .    the choice of the current operator @xmath96 is to some extent arbitrary ( see discussion in refs .",
    "here we consider the two most popular choices denoted as cc1 and cc2  @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the nucleon form factors related in the usual way  @xcite to the electric and magnetic sachs form factors of the dipole form .",
    "the variable @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is the four - momentum of the initial nucleon for on - shell kinematics , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "thus the evaluation of the one - body current matrix element involves the use of @xmath21-operators and 4-spinors with negative energy components .",
    "this is at variance with the nonrelativistic ( dwia ) approximation where a truncated current operator is used  @xcite and matrix elements are evaluated between bispinorial wave functions ( @xmath104 ) . therefore in the discussion of results in next sections",
    "we shall refer to relativistic kinematical effects that have to do with the differences due to the use of the complete relativistic current operator instead of the truncated one and to relativistic dynamical effects . a way to fully incorporate the kinematical relativistic effects",
    "was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for the reaction @xmath105 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the dynamical effects come from the differences between relativistic and nonrelativistic potentials and wave functions . in ref .",

    "another dynamical relativistic effect is that coming from the non - zero overlap with dirac sea of the dirac solutions with s - v potentials .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 wave functions have the general structure @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the projections on the positive and negative energy solutions of the dirac equation for free particles : @xmath119 where we use the notation and conventions of bjorken and drell  @xcite , so that the positive and negative energy projectors are @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "explicit expressions and figures showing @xmath126 and @xmath127 for several orbitals can be found in ref .",
    "here we just mention that the dynamical enhancement of the down component is proportional to the nonzero dirac sea overlap , @xmath127 , and that though it is small , it was found to play an important role in the @xmath36 response function in the rpwia calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the rdwia calculations at high @xmath32 reported in refs .",

    "the sensitivity of the different scattering observables to the negative energy components can be analyzed by constructing properly normalized 4-spinors of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq11a ] ) .",

    "( [ nucc ] ) with those obtained when the negative energy components are projected out .",

    "although ema - nosv approach also neglects the enhancement of the lower components , it is not at all equivalent to the exact projection method in eqs .",
    "( [ eq9],[eq10a ] ) .",
    "the ema - nosv approach computes the nucleon current with four - spinors that have the same structure than the ones encountered in the scattering of free nucleons , because it enforces the relationship between upper and lower components to be driven by the asymptotic value of the momenta at the nucleon vertex .",

    "consequently , at the energies considered , edad-1,-2 potential lead to larger spectroscopic factors than edai - o in @xmath33o , while the two potentials lead to similar spectroscopic factors in @xmath30pb .",
    "the same is true for edad-3 and other versions of the relativistic edad potentials .    to have a more conclusive determination of @xmath33o spectroscopic factors one would need to constrain the optical potential choice by means of inelastic ( @xmath167 ) data , in addition to the elastic ones @xcite . but this is not available for the small knock - out proton energies ( @xmath168 mev ) considered here nor in a fully relativistic framework .",
    "the large @xmath162 values in the left part of table  i for all the optical potentials have to do with the fact that the data do not follow the shape of theoretical reduced cross - sections in the right panel of fig .  1 .",
    "a similar problem has been found for data sets ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath170 ) where the quality of nlsh fits is even worse .",
    "this , after all , is not surprising because the standard lagrangians , like nlsh , are fitted to bulk properties of a few heavy nuclei , and one may expect that the predicted r.m.s .",
    "radii of @xmath33o orbitals differ somewhat from experiment . unfortunately ,",
    "as seen in table  i this produces large uncertainties in spectroscopic factors . to solve this problem",
    "we may adjust the parameters of the relativistic potentials ( or lagrangian ) so as to obtain the correct values of the single particle energies and r.m.s .",
    "radii for the orbitals considered , in an analogous way to what is usually done in nonrelativistic analyses of @xmath10 data .",
    "this is what we do next .",
    "compared to data sets @xmath142 and @xmath153 , data set @xmath139 has many more data points extending over a larger @xmath14 range .",
    "therefore , this data set can be used much more reliably to determine _ simultaneously _ spectroscopic factors and r.m.s.r .",
    "we have then adopted the following strategy : first , we use data set @xmath139 to slightly tune the parameters of the nlsh potential so as to reproduce the experimental binding energies and r.m.s.r",
    ". values of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals in @xmath33o , closely resembling the standard nonrelativistic procedure .",
    "we denote by nlsh - p the new relativistic potentials and wave functions ( see table  ii ) .",
    "these new relativistic wave functions are then used to make predictions for the kinematical conditions of data sets @xmath142 and @xmath153 .",
    "the nlsh - p wave functions are obtained by changing the parameters of the nlsh lagrangian so that the radii and depth of the s and v potential wells derived from the lagrangian are modified in the same proportion .",
    "the negative energy content of the resulting bound state wave function is barely changed by this procedure .",
    "the rescaling of the depth size and radii of the nlsh - p wells is within 10% of the initial nlsh ones .",
    "the improvement obtained in the description of the shapes and quality of the fits is clearly visible in fig .  1 and table  i.    the role played by relativistic dynamical effects",
    "is also analyzed from the results presented in fig .  1 and table  i. each curve in fig .",
    "1 is scaled by the corresponding spectroscopic factors in table  i. the reduced cross - sections evaluated after projecting the bound and scattered proton wave functions over positive energy states ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ) are shown by thin - dashed ( pcc1 ) and thick - dashed ( pcc2 ) lines .",
    "note that the difference between pcc1 and pcc2 results is very small because the so - called gordon ambiguities are reduced after projection  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained using the asymptotic values of the momenta in the projection operator as described in section ii.b , are almost identical to the pcc2 results and thus are not shown here .",
    "once the global scale factor is taken into account , all the calculations predict a very similar behavior , what indicates that , aside from the darwin term , the effect of relativistic dynamics in the reduced cross - sections is not important in parallel kinematics at low values of @xmath32 .",
    "this agrees with a recent work by giusti and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "this observation also agrees with results of some previous works  @xcite where we saw that the dynamical enhancement of the lower component makes an important effect in the cross - section mainly at high missing momentum values and/or in the @xmath42 response function ( which _ does not contribute in parallel kinematics _ ) , whereas its influence on @xmath158 and @xmath159 is quite modest .    comparing the fully relativistic results with nlsh - p wave functions for cc1 and cc2",
    ", one observes that the differences are at most of the order of @xmath171 . in the case of the projected calculation",
    ", we note that the spectroscopic factors are slightly larger than those corresponding to a fully relativistic calculation .",
    "this is due to the enhancement of the lower components of the wave functions which is not contained in the projected approximations .",
    "their effect is negligible for cc2 operator and is enhanced by the cc1 choice .",
    "we recall that another dynamical relativistic effect , namely the darwin term , is contained in all the figures and tables shown here . for edai - o optical potential",
    "this effect amounts to a 10% reduction of the reduced cross - section in @xmath33o for the kinematics discussed in this work .",
    "this is comparable to the effect of the perey factor that was included in nonrelativistic dweepy calculations  @xcite while for edad - optical potentials this amounts to a 20@xmath172 reduction .",
    "one thus expects the spectroscopic factors listed in table  i for edai - o in the projected case to be similar to those obtained from fits with standard nonrelativistic dwia calculations including perey factors . in this last case",
    "the extracted factors for various choices of optical potentials are @xmath173 for @xmath4 , and @xmath174 for @xmath5  @xcite , which are also roughly in agreement with those in table  i for nlsh - p and edad - type potentials .",
    "a smaller spectroscopic factor is expected for the @xmath5 shell than for the @xmath4 , because the @xmath5 strength is known to be fragmented into three states : the state considered here at @xmath175 mev , and two weaker peaks at around 22.0 and 22.7 mev . according to  @xcite the two higher lying peaks would contain about 10% of the total @xmath5 strength .",
    "the spectroscopic factors determined from data set @xmath139 indicate that , taking this extra 10% contribution into account , there is similar @xmath151 and @xmath176 spectroscopic strength .    in what follows we use the new bound state wave functions ( nlsh - p ) to make predictions for comparison to the other data sets @xmath142 and @xmath153 . we stress that we have used high quality data to fix the size of the wave function and that because data set @xmath139 corresponds to parallel kinematics no experimental information on the @xmath42 response has been employed .",
    "let us now focus on the spectroscopic factors obtained from reduced cross - sections in data sets @xmath142 and @xmath153 .",
    "3 shows the reduced cross - sections for @xmath4 and @xmath5 shells .",
    "left and right panel correspond respectively to data sets @xmath142 and @xmath153 .",
    "as in fig .  1",
    ", for each curve a global scale factor has been fitted to the experimental data .",
    "the corresponding scale factors and their statistical errors are listed in table  iii .",
    "similarly to what we saw for set @xmath139 , also for sets @xmath142 and @xmath153 edad - type optical potentials give larger spectroscopic factors than edai - o ( see also fig .  4 ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath5 shell corresponding to the saclay experiment ( left panel ) include the contribution of the @xmath157 doublet .",
    "we have verified that the change in the shape of the responses or reduced cross - section after inclusion of the doublet is small .",
    "the main effect of its inclusion is a decrease of the deduced spectroscopic factor for the @xmath5 shell of the order of @xmath177 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the contribution of this doublet was subtracted from the experimental data with a procedure based on a nonrelativistic formalism .",
    "we have chosen to use the uncorrected data from ref .",
    "@xcite , and include the contribution from the doublet in our theoretical calculation .",
    "the @xmath178 content has been determined through fits to data set @xmath139 for this state  @xcite .",
    "the values of the spectroscopic factors are @xmath179 ( rcc1 ) , @xmath180 ( rcc2 ) , @xmath181 ( rcc1 ) , @xmath182 ( rcc2 ) ( with a @xmath183 of the order of 0.5 ) .",
    "let us now discuss the results corresponding to data set @xmath142 in left panel of fig .",
    "as shown , the calculations reproduce in general the experimental data for both shells with the scale factors listed in table  iii .",
    "although the various approximations give similar results , we note that the rcc1 ( thin solid line ) reduced cross - sections for the @xmath4 shell are less symmetrical around @xmath184 , a behavior that is not favored by the data . for this data set @xmath142 all the calculations , except rcc1 for the @xmath4 shell , reproduce well the asymmetry of the reduced cross - section .",
    "we will return to this point when talking about the @xmath36 observables in next section .",
    "finally , it is important to remark that the spectroscopic factors obtained from the data set @xmath142 ( table  iii ) agree , within statistical errors , with those obtained from data set @xmath139 taking into account the systematic error of both experiments : around 5.4% for data set @xmath139  @xcite and 6.3% for data set @xmath142  @xcite .    concerning set @xmath153  @xcite the data on reduced cross - sections in right panel of fig .",
    "3 have been obtained from the differential cross - sections and detailed kinematics setup in appendices a and d of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the systematic error for data set @xmath153 reduced cross - section is 6%  @xcite ) . for the @xmath4 shell",
    ", the reduced cross - section is well reproduced by both relativistic and projected calculations , except in the case of the rcc1 calculation ( thin solid line ) that underestimates the data for negative missing momentum values .",
    "this is consistent with the results previously discussed for data set @xmath142 . for this shell ,",
    "the spectroscopic factors that fit data set @xmath153 are larger than the ones derived from data sets @xmath139 or @xmath142 , but they are all compatible within statistical errors . in the case of the @xmath5 shell , although the shape of the cross - section is well reproduced by the various calculations , the situation on the spectroscopic factors is clearly different ( see table  iii ) . with edai - o optical potential",
    "the values of the spectroscopic factors that fit the @xmath5 data on reduced cross - sections in set ( @xmath170 ) are @xmath185 larger than the ones obtained from data set @xmath139 .",
    "these scale factors are also larger than the ones obtained from data set @xmath142 , but in this case the discrepancy is of the order of 15% , which is comparable to the combined systematic and statistical error for these values .",
    "edad - type potentials not only give larger spectroscopic factors but also give , on average , better agreement between @xmath5 spectroscopic factors of the three different sets ( @xmath186 ) , ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "this is seen in detail in tables i and iii and is further illustrated in fig .  4 .    in summary ,",
    "the shapes of the reduced cross - sections are well described by all the rcc2 calculations and data sets , what makes us conclude that we can rely on the spectroscopic factors derived with edad-1 and nlsh - p potentials .",
    "thus the differences in the @xmath5 spectroscopic factors ( see fig .",
    "4 ) obtained with the same ingredients ( wave functions , operators and optical potentials ) may be attributed either to a global scale variation among the three experiments for the @xmath5 shell , or to limitations of the theory . coupled channel contributions or mec could possibly make a different effect for the three kinematics analyzed in this work .      in this section we present results for the response functions and asymmetries and compare them to the data in sets",
    "@xmath142 and @xmath153 measured at saclay  @xcite and nikhef  @xcite , respectively .",
    "as already mentioned , these two experiments were performed under @xmath143 constant kinematics so that the @xmath36 response and asymmetry ( @xmath187 ) can be obtained from the cross - sections measured at @xmath72 and @xmath188 with the other variables ( @xmath12 , @xmath189 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 ) held constant . moreover , the response functions @xmath190 and @xmath159 were also determined for data set @xmath153  @xcite .    figs .  5 and 6 show respectively @xmath42 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 ( upper panels ) and @xmath5 ( lower panels ) corresponding to set @xmath142 ( left panels ) and set @xmath153 ( right panels ) . in each panel",
    "we present four curves with the same conventions as in previous figures : rcc1 ( thin solid ) , rcc2 ( thick solid ) , pcc1 ( thin - dashed ) and pcc2 ( thick - dashed ) .",
    "each @xmath42 curve is scaled with the corresponding spectroscopic factor quoted in table  iii . as it was also the case for reduced cross - sections ,",
    "there are no appreciable differences in the shapes of curves obtained with the different types of optical potentials . obviously , the asymmetry @xmath3 is independent on the value of the spectroscopic factor .",
    "the results for the @xmath5 shell in bottom - left panel of figs .",
    "5 and 6 include the contribution of the ( @xmath147,@xmath148 ) doublet as explained for set ( @xmath169 ) in previous section .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath3 was not produced by the saclay experiment ( set@xmath142 ) , but we have deduced @xmath3 from the data using the @xmath42 values as well as the cross - section data in  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "5 we also show by dotted lines the nonrelativistic results of ref .",
    "@xcite . for comparison to previous studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , we quote in table  iv the factor required to scale the theoretical predictions to the @xmath42 data , additional to the factors in table  iii .",
    "a value of one in this table indicates that the same spectroscopic factor fits _ both _ the reduced cross - section and @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. , _ indicates that the @xmath36 strength is consistently predicted by the theory .",
    "let us first discuss the comparison between theory and experiment for data set @xmath142 . from the results shown in figs .  5 and 6 , it is clear that the effects of the negative - energy components show up more in @xmath42 and @xmath3 than in the cross - sections ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in the case of the @xmath4 shell ( left - top panel of fig .  5 )",
    ", the rcc2 calculation agrees with experimental data within statistical errors , while pcc1 and pcc2 results for @xmath42 ( dashed lines ) lie about a 30 - 50% below the data , and the rcc1 calculation ( thin solid line ) overestimates the @xmath42 response by around 20% ( see table  iv ) . in the case of the @xmath5 orbit ( left - bottom panel ) , all the approximations predict similar curves : the projected results are much closer to fully relativistic ones than for the @xmath4 shell .",
    "overall , the fully relativistic calculations seem to be favored by the data .",
    "the fact that in this shell the variation introduced by the negative energy components is much smaller than for the @xmath4 shell explains why the difference between rcc1 and rcc2 results is smaller for the @xmath5 than for the @xmath4 shell .",
    "these results agree with the conclusion reached from rpwia calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite about the behavior of @xmath191 spin - orbit partners which was also corroborated in rdwia calculations at high @xmath32  @xcite .    with regards to the @xmath36 observable , independent on the spectroscopic factor",
    ", we may conclude that for @xmath4 shell , @xmath3 is best reproduced by rcc2 results , while for @xmath5 shell the four theoretical results are very close together , and the experimental data agree with all of them .    in the right panels of figs .  5 and 6 we see the results corresponding to data set @xmath153",
    "most of the comments on data set @xmath142 apply also here , though the data are somewhat more scattered and have larger error bars . in the case of the @xmath4 shell , pcc1 and pcc2 results",
    "are very similar and lie below the data ; among the fully relativistic calculation , the rcc2 result reproduces the data within statistical errors , while rcc1 overestimates them by a 35% . in the case of the @xmath5 shell ( bottom - right panel ) , all the calculations underestimate the experimental @xmath36 response by around 17 - 28% , except rcc1 for which the `` additional '' factor in table  iv is compatible with one within statistical errors .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the results for the responses @xmath192 ( top panels ) and @xmath159 ( bottom panels ) for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 shells compared to the data from nikhef  @xcite .",
    "each curve is scaled with the spectroscopic factors quoted in table  iii .",
    "notice that these responses are rather insensitive to dynamical enhancement of lower components .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior observed in fig .  1 and also with results of rpwia calculations  @xcite . the results in fig .",
    "7 indicate that the separated responses are in general well reproduced by the relativistic as well as by the projected calculations for both shells , exception made of the data point at the lowest missing momenta where , as indicated by the large error bars , the @xmath193 separation is more problematic .",
    "summarizing , for the @xmath4 shell the rcc2 results agree well with all observables and data sets , while rcc1 ( projected ) calculations show a too large ( small ) @xmath42 and @xmath3 . for the @xmath5 shell",
    "the theoretical calculations lie much closer together , and generally agree with all data sets and observables , except for @xmath42 and @xmath3 of data set @xmath153 .",
    "although the @xmath42 , @xmath3 data on @xmath5 in set ( @xmath170 ) lie higher than theoretical calculations , they are almost compatible with rcc1 and rcc2 calculations within statistical errors .",

    "the latter were also fitted to leuschner data  @xcite .      in this section",
    "we focus in fig .  5 comparing our results to previous nonrelativistic ones .",
    "the dotted curves -representing the nonrelativistic calculations by spaltro _ et .",
    "@xcite- clearly underestimate @xmath36 responses for all shell and data sets .",
    "the deviation from data is larger for @xmath5 shell , particularly in data set ( @xmath170 ) , where the dotted curve gives roughly one half of the experimental @xmath36 response .",
    "why is it that relativistic results in this figure are so much closer to data that nonrelativistic ones ? .",
    "we have examined in detail effects due to the various aspects that are relevant in comparing relativistic to nonrelativistic results .",
    "the effects of darwin term are already taken into account as they basically affect the spectroscopic factors .",
    "the effects of the negative energy components , as already mentioned , are very small for @xmath158 , @xmath159 responses in all data sets ( @xmath186 ) , ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath170 ) but , as seen in fig .",
    "5 and table  iv , they are important for @xmath36 observables in data sets ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath170 ) , particularly for the @xmath4 shell .",
    "we are then left to consider the effect of truncation of the current operator ( tco ) .",
    "tco produces also a negligible effect at the kinematics of data set ( @xmath186 ) , but it is more important at the kinematics of data sets ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "this again affects more the @xmath36 responses and asymmetries where it may represent up to a @xmath194 effect ( see also ref .",
    "thus for @xmath4 shell , tco roughly explains the difference at the maxima between dotted curves and the curves obtained with projected calculations .",
    "however for @xmath5 shell tco explains only a small fraction of the difference between dotted curves and results of projected calculations .",
    "the largest fraction of this difference is due to the use of a too small spectroscopic factor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that was taken from ref .  @xcite and that by no means fits the data on reduced cross - sections in set ( @xmath170 ) . as seen in tables i , iii and fig .  4 the spectroscopic factor deduced from reduced cross - sections in data set ( @xmath170 ) is @xmath185 larger than that from data set ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "the message from this is , not only that relativistic effects are important in perpendicular kinematics at low @xmath32 , but also that a careful analysis of all pieces of information has to be done to get a consistent picture of the three different sets of data . since @xmath42 responses are known to be sensitive not only to relativistic effects but also to exchange currents , or other possible many - body effects , it is important to establish a clear framework that allows to look for the proper magnitude of such effects .    indeed if we compare our results to data for the @xmath3 observable that is free from spectroscopic factor ambiguities , we find that all data are well reproduced with the standard cc2 current operator , except the @xmath5 data in set ( @xmath170 ) which are only larger than theory by a factor @xmath195 .",
    "this is to be compared to the @xmath196 factor that one could expect from ref .",
