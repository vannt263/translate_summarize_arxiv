    "extracting secret random numbers in the presence of quantum attacker is one of important topics in quantum information theory .",
    "the classical version of this topic was discussed by @xcite . the quantum version is mainly treated by renner@xcite and his collaborators with using universal@xmath1 hash function .",
    "indeed , a universal@xmath1 hash function can be implemented with small amount of calculation . as is shown by renner@xcite ,",
    "when the classical random variable is correlated with eavesdropper s quantum state , applying a universal@xmath1 hash function as a privacy amplification process , we obtain a secret random variable .    when the size of generated final random variable is sufficiently small , the final bits are almost independent of eavesdropper s quantum state .",
    "then , it is needed to evaluate the leaked information of the protocol using a universal@xmath1 hash function . in order to evaluate the secrecy",
    ", renner@xcite showed a privacy amplification theorem under the trace norm distance with the conditional rnyi entropy of order 2 .",
    "combining this theorem to the smoothing method , he provided the evaluation for the secrecy of final random variable .",
    "however , application of smoothing has several difficulty . in this paper , we derive another type of privacy amplification theorem by using the conditional rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 .",
    "then , we can directly show the security without smoothing when the final key size is smaller than the conditional entropy .",
    "that is , our proof is more direct as is mention below .    in this paper",
    ", we use a security criterion for leaked information and the difference from the uniform distribution by modifying the quantum mutual information . using the conditional rnyi entropy of order @xmath0",
    ", we propose other types of privacy amplification theorems under the above criterion .",
    "the fundamental theorem for this purpose is derived by extending classical privacy amplification theorems obtained by @xcite .",
    "using one of these theorems , we derive an exponential decreasing rate of the criterion .",
    "that is , when the extracted key rate is less than the conditional entropy , the criterion goes to zero exponentially .",
    "then , we derive an exponential decreasing rate for leaked information , whose commutative case is the same as that by @xcite .",
    "our derivation is contrastive with @xcite in the point that our method does not employ smoothing method .",
    "our exponent is better than that given in @xcite under the modified quantum mutual information criterion .",
    "further , using the pinsker inequality , we apply our result to the criterion for the trace norm distance .",
    "when the extracted key rate is larger than the conditional entropy , the leaked information does not go to zero . in this case , we focus on the minimum conditional entropy rate . the rate is called the equivocation rate @xcite and the quantum version has not been treated until now .",
    "then , we derive the equivocation rate as by treating the minimum leaked information rate",
    ". the smoothing method can not evaluate the leaked information rate in this case while the smoothing method can derive lower bounds for exponential decreasing rate@xcite .",
    "since our method directly evaluate the information amount leaked to the eavesdropper , it enable us to derive the equivocation rate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] , we prepare quantum versions of information quantities . in section [ s3 ] , we formulate our setting and derive the exponents of leaked information when the key generation rate is less than the conditional entropy rate . in section [ s7 ] , we compare our exponents with the exponents given by the smoothing method in @xcite . in section [ s4 ] , we derive the equivocation rate as the minimum conditional entropy for a given key generation rate .",
    "the proofs for theorem [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] are given in appendix .",
    "in order to treat leaked information after universal@xmath1 privacy amplification in the quantum setting , we prepare several information quantities in a composite system @xmath2 , in which , @xmath3 is a classical system spanned by the basis @xmath4 .",
    "when the composite state is @xmath5 , the von neumann entropies and renyi entropies are given as @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "when we focus on the total system of a given density @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are simplified to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "two kinds of quantum versions of the conditional entropy and conditional renyi entropy are given for @xmath14 : @xmath15 the quantity @xmath16 is used for the exponential decreasing rate for the security criterion in section iii while @xmath17 is used for our derivation of the equivocation rate in section iv .",
    "indeed , while the quantity @xmath18 is the same as the quantity @xmath19 given in @xcite and the quantity @xmath20 given in @xcite , the quantity @xmath21 is different from the quantity @xmath22 given in @xcite with @xmath23 .    since the functions @xmath24 and    @xmath25 are concave and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are monotone decreasing for @xmath7 . since @xmath29 coincides with the min entropy @xmath30 , @xmath31 . since @xmath32",
    ", we have @xmath33 for @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "further , since @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 for @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "then , the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be evaluated by two kinds of quantum versions of the mutual information @xmath40 by using the completely mixed state @xmath41 on @xmath42 , two kinds of quantum versions of the mutual information can be modified to @xmath43 which satisfy @xmath44 and @xmath45    indeed , the quantity @xmath46 represents the amount of information leaked to @xmath47 , and the remaining quantity @xmath48 describes the difference of the random number @xmath38 from the uniform random number .",
    "so , if the quantity @xmath49 is small , we can conclude that the random number @xmath38 has less correlation with @xmath47 and is close to the uniform random number .",
    "in particular , if the quantity @xmath49 goes to zero , the mutual information @xmath50 goes to zero , and the state @xmath51 goes to the completely mixed state @xmath41 .",
    "hence , we can adopt the quantity @xmath49 as a criterion for qualifying the secret random number .    using the trace norm",
    ", we can evaluate the secrecy for the state @xmath9 as follows : @xmath52 taking into account the randomness , renner @xcite defined the following criteria for security of a secret random number : @xmath53 using the quantum version of pinsker inequality , we obtain @xmath54    when we apply the function @xmath55 to the classical random number @xmath56 , @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58    as is shown in @xcite , when we apply a quantum operation @xmath59 on @xmath39 , since it does not act on the classical system @xmath42 , @xmath60    when the state @xmath61 has the spectral decomposition @xmath62 , the pinching map @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 when @xmath65 is the number of the eigenvalues of @xmath61 , the inequality @xmath66 holds ( * ? ? ? * lemma 3.8),@xcite .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath67 as @xmath68 is matrix monotone , @xmath69 since @xmath70 we obtain @xmath71 therefore , when @xmath65 is the number of the eigenvalues of @xmath72 , an inequality @xmath73 holds . using these relations",
    ", we can show the following lemma .",
    "@xmath74    applying ( [ 8 - 26 - 3 ] ) to the case of @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 since @xmath77 is matrix monotone , we obtain @xmath78^s \\le   v^s   [ ( \\rho^e)^{-1/2 } { \\cal e}_{\\rho^e}(\\rho ) ( \\rho^e)^{-1/2 } ] ^s.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath79^s \\\\ \\le & v^s   { { \\rm tr}\\,}\\rho [ ( \\rho^e)^{-1/2 } { \\cal e}_{\\rho^e}(\\rho ) ( \\rho^e)^{-1/2 } ] ^s\\\\ = & v^s   { { \\rm tr}\\,}{\\cal e}_{\\rho^e}(\\rho ) [ ( \\rho^e)^{-1/2 } { \\cal e}_{\\rho^e}(\\rho ) ( \\rho^e)^{-1/2 } ] ^s = v^s   e^{-s\\overline{h}^*_{1+s}(a|e|{\\cal e}_{\\rho^e}(\\rho ) ) } \\\\ = &   v^s   e^{-s h_{1+s}(a|e|{\\cal e}_{\\rho^e}(\\rho ) ) } \\le   v^s   e^{-s h_{1+s}(a|e|\\rho ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( [ 8 - 15 - 12 ] ) is used in the final inequality . letting @xmath80 be the number of eigenvalues of @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 taking the limit @xmath83 , we obtain ( [ 8 - 29 - 20 ] ) .",
    "we consider the secure key extraction problem from a common classical random number @xmath56 which has been partially eavesdropped as quantum states by eve .",
    "for this problem , it is assumed that alice and bob share a common classical random number @xmath56 , and eve has a quantum state @xmath84 , which is correlated to the random number @xmath85 .",
    "the task is to extract a common random number @xmath86 from the random number @xmath56 , which is almost independent of eve s quantum state . here",
    ", alice and bob are only allowed to apply the same function @xmath55 to the common random number @xmath56 as fig .",

    "the second equation holds as follows .",
