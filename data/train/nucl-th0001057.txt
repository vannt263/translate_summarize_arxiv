    "nowadays , the threshold @xmath7- and @xmath1- amplitudes of @xmath5 photoproduction off the deuteron are of considerable theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "this is motivated by two reasons .",
    "firstly , the deuteron is a natural ` source ' of neutrons .",
    "if one wants to minimize uncertainties stemming from nuclear forces when extracting neutron threshold parameters one should use a deuteron target . at present , there is a significant disagreement for values of the threshold electric dipole amplitude @xmath8 calculated in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and dispersion theory ( dr ) , respectively , 2.13 @xcite and 1.19 @xcite ( in units of @xmath9 which are suppressed from here on ) . at the same time",
    "the predicted values for @xmath10 agree reasonably with each other ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) and with experimental values @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite . resolving the problem mentioned in favour of the one or the other theory requires experimental measurements of which in the reactions @xmath15 and @xmath16 seem to be most promising .",
    "however , even in these simplest reactions many theoretical problems in the extraction of neutron data are anticipated .",
    "on the other hand , the deuteron can not be considered as a direct sum of the proton and neutron ( impulse approximation ) .",
    "photons may also interact with potential ( virtual ) mesons .",
    "this effect is known as ` meson exchange currents ' ( mec ) .",
    "it was found to be very important in the case of coherent neutral pion photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite . accepting the chpt predictions for free nucleons we could expect in the impulse approximation a value of about @xmath17 ( @xmath18 $ ] ) for the deuteron electric dipole amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , however , the chpt result is quite different being about @xmath19 @xcite and the difference is due to the meson exchange contributions .",
    "a very recent measurement of @xmath4 performed at sal @xcite in coherent @xmath5 photoproduction on the deuteron within 20 mev of threshold has given a value of @xmath20 which is about 20% lower than the chpt prediction .",
    "there is also a significant deviation from the chpt prediction for the free - nucleon @xmath6 amplitude .",
    "a comparison of the differential cross sections calculated in a theoretical model @xcite with the data revealed a noticeable disagreement as well .",
    "it was claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that a possible reason for the disagreements might consist in inadequate treatment of the inelastic channel in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath21 reaction can not be resolved one has to estimate its contribution to the coherent channel making the use of theoretical predictions .",
    "indeed , a model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be oversimplified .",
    "for example , the authors employed a square - well deuteron wave function and used the effective range approximation to describe the final state @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "the deuteron @xmath22-wave was ignored .",
    "explicit calculations of very important diagrams with @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering were not carried out .",
    "effectively these latter where included into the model by accepting the extracted value @xmath23 for @xmath4 which , as it has been noted , contains contributions from mec or , in other words , from @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering .",
    "although a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath24 , based on input parameters , was assigned in ref .",
    "@xcite to the calculated cross sections it would be desirable to have more realistic calculations for the inelastic channel .",
    "the present paper is aimed at fixing the defects of the model @xcite .",
    "we are going to study whether these defects may be responsible for the deviations mentioned . in our previous paper @xcite on the reaction [ react ]",
    "d^0 np we restricted ourselves to the energy region 200 to 400 mev . now we extend the model to the threshold region .",
    "the extension includes : i ) a more realistic treatment of the @xmath5 photoproduction amplitudes at threshold energies ; ii ) in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering mechanism but without taking into account the @xmath0-@xmath1 rescattering process which may follow @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering . in the present paper a corresponding diagram has been taken into account .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the study of the process ( [ react ] ) in the threshold region is hardly of theoretical interest in its own .",
    "rather it is needed for experimentalists to estimate the relative contribution of the inelastic channel to the cross section of coherent pion photoproduction on the deuteron .",
    "furthermore , these studies may be useful for extracting the elementary @xmath25 amplitude from exclusive inelastic data where the recoil neutron is detected .",
    "let us denote by @xmath26 and @xmath27 the 4-momenta of the initial photon and deuteron and the final pion , neutron and proton , respectively in the @xmath28-@xmath22 c.m . frame .",
    "a symbol @xmath29 we reserve for the lab photon energy @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the deuteron mass .",
    "it is convenient to take as independent kinematical variables the photon energy and pion angle , @xmath33 , in the c.m .",
    "frame and momentum @xmath34 of one of the nucleons - say , the neutron - in the final @xmath0-@xmath1 c.m .",
    "frame ( see ref .",
    "once these variables have been specified the pion momentum can be easily found : |q|=12w_d , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the nucleon mass ) and @xmath37 is the @xmath5 mass . then making a boost with the velocity @xmath38 we obtain the neutron momentum @xmath39 and , therefore , totally restore the kinematics in the @xmath28-@xmath22 c.m .",
    "note that in kinematic calculations a distinction is not made between the proton and neutron masses .",
    "it is , however , taken into account in the threshold @xmath5 photoproduction amplitude when parametrizing the @xmath7- and @xmath1-waves multipoles ( see sect . [",
    "theory ] , eq .",
    "( [ benmer ] ) ) .",
    "the differential cross section is [ dcs4 ] = 1(2)^5 16 _",
    "m_pm_nm_d | m_pm_n| t| m_d |^2 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath32 are spin states of the proton , neutron , photon , and deuteron , respectively .",
    "assuming that near threshold energies the nucleons are not detected we should integrate the l.h.s .",
    "( [ dcs4 ] ) over the momentum @xmath34 to obtain [ dcs ] = _",
    "0^p^max p^2dp d_p , where the maximum value @xmath43 is found from energy - momentum conservation and reads [ pmax ] p^max = 12 .",
    "the scattering amplitude of the reaction ( [ react ] ) is described as a sum of contributions from diagrams which are expected to be most important in the energy region under consideration .",
    "the pole diagrams _ a _ and _ b _ in fig .  [ fig1 ] and one - loop diagram [ fig1]_c _",
    "correspond to the impulse approximation without and with @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction in the final state , respectively .",
    "the necessity to consider the latter mechanism follows from the very strong nucleon - nucleon interaction at small energies .",
    "it might seem that diagrams [ fig1 ] _ d _ to _ f _ with @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering could be disregarded in the threshold region since the @xmath2-@xmath3 scattering lengths are about two orders smaller than those for @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering .",
    "in fact , however , there is actually no suppression of the diagrams [ fig1]_d _ to _ f _ in comparison with diagram [ fig1]_c_. indeed , keeping in mind that the threshold electric dipole amplitudes @xmath45 for charged channels are about 30 times larger in absolute numbers than those for the neutral channels one can expect the corresponding contributions from @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering to be of the same order as the ones from final state @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "this expectation will be confirmed below by numerical calculations .",
    "a very big effect of @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering in the case of coherent @xmath5 photoproduction on the deuteron in the threshold region was also found in refs .",
    "note that our treatment of @xmath2-@xmath3 contribution is similar to the one of ` three - body interactions to order @xmath46 ' from ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of coherent @xmath5 photoproduction off the deuteron .",
    "it was found in that paper that three - body contributions at order @xmath47 are less important .",
    "based on this finding we do not take into account the corresponding diagrams for the reaction ( [ react ] ) though they of course exist .",
    "we begin with the pole diagrams .",
    "the matrix element corresponding to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1]_a _ reads [ pol_n ] m_pm_n| t^1a(k , q , p_p ) | m_d=_m_n ^m_d_m_pm_n(p_p+2 ) m_n| t_n^0 n(k_n , q_n ) | m_n , where @xmath48 is the deuteron wave function ( dwf ) and @xmath49 is the amplitude of the elementary process @xmath50 .",
    "the amplitude depends on photon ( @xmath51 ) and pion ( @xmath52 ) momenta taken in the c.m .",
    "frame of the @xmath2-@xmath0 pair .",
    "these momenta can be obtained from the corresponding momenta in the @xmath28-@xmath22 c.m .",
    "frame through a boost with the velocity @xmath53 .    in calculations we used dwf for non - relativistic versions of the bonn obe potential @xcite (",
    "the same models were used when solving the lippmann - schwinger equation for the @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering amplitude needed for calculations of diagrams [ fig1]_c _ and _ f _ , see below ) .",
    "analytical parametrizations of the @xmath7- and @xmath22-wave amplitudes were taken from ref .",
    "we would like to note just here that our results are practically independent of the choice of the potentials .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite we used the well - known blomqvist - laget parametrization @xcite of the pion photoproduction amplitudes .",
    "this model is rather simple and , nevertheless , fits reasonably to the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , it is obsolete in the sense that it predicts the threshold electric dipole amplitudes for the neutral channels in accordance with the classical low - energy theorem , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , but in disagreement with the modern values ( see sect .",
    "[ intr ] ) . to be consistent with these latter , we use in the energy region @xmath56 mev a parametrization for the neutral pion photoproduction amplitude given in ref .",
    "the threshold amplitude in the @xmath28-@xmath3 c.m .",
    "frame can be written in the following form @xcite [ benmer ] t_n^0n =- m , where @xmath57 is the total energy of the @xmath28-@xmath3 system , and @xmath6 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the @xmath1-waves multipoles . the @xmath45 amplitude was taken in the form of eq .",
    "( 25 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with parameters from table i of the same work .",
    "the parametrization takes into account the energy dependence of the @xmath45 multipole as well as the so - called cusp effect . just at threshold",
    "it reproduces the chpt and dr values ( see sect .",
    "[ intr ] ) .",
    "these parametrizations were used in the present paper to study uncertainties due to the choice of a theoretical model for pion photoproduction . as to the @xmath1-wave amplitudes",
    ", they are also taken for two models and listed in table  [ tab1 ] . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parametrizations corresponding to chpt and dr reproduce very well the available data on the energy dependence of the real part of @xmath45 as well as the total and differential cross sections of the reaction @xmath60 up to @xmath61 mev .          performing in eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) an integration over the pion solid angle @xmath63 we can calculate the total cross section @xmath64 of the reaction ( [ react ] ) ( note that @xmath65 where @xmath64 is in units of @xmath37b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show contributions of different diagrams to @xmath64 with the chpt set for the multipoles in eq .",
    "( [ benmer ] ) .",
    "the two pole diagrams produce a total cross section which is rapidly increasing with photon energy .",
    "after inclusion of the @xmath0-@xmath1 final state interaction the energy distribution of @xmath64 becomes to be more flat . just above threshold",
    "this interaction in the @xmath66-wave leads to an increase of @xmath64 but at @xmath67 mev the cross section diminishes by a factor of about 2 .",
    "diagrams [ fig1]_d _ and _ e _ with @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering give noticeable positive contribution to the total cross section .",
    "of all the diagrams [ fig1]_f _ is the least important one , decreasing @xmath64 by about 10% .",
    "the total cross sections for various choices of nucleon energies in the right loop of diagram [ fig1]_f _ are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "it is seen that they are practically independent of a prescription for the energy .",
    "this reflects the smallness of the diagram [ fig1]_f _ contribution to the total cross section .",
    "our predictions for @xmath64 with the chpt and dr sets of the multipoles are also shown in fig .",
    "there is a deviation of about 15% in the full energy region .      in fig .",
    "[ errors ] we compare our results with the ones of the model @xcite for the differential and total cross sections .",
    "one can see that the predictions of the two calculations are quite consistent .",
    "there is some disagreement at @xmath68 mev and forward angles for the differential cross section .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that this disagreement can not make any noticeable changes in the cross sections of coherent @xmath5 photoproduction measured in ref .",
    "@xcite because of smallness of the inelastic channel cross sections in comparison with the coherent channel ones .",
    "at the same time , at backward angles the inelastic channel is growing in importance but there the deviation is not very significant .",
    "one can see that the maximum deviation between the present calculation and the one of ref .",
    "@xcite does not exceed 20% at 160 mev and backward angles , being even smaller when the energy is decreasing .",
    "( note here that the authors of that paper ascribed to their calculated cross sections of the inelastic channel uncertainties of about @xmath24 which were taken into account in their data analysis ) . in the case of the total cross section we observe good agreement with ref .",
    "an analysis performed by bergstrom @xcite has shown that the @xmath6 amplitude is insensitive to the variation in the inelastic cross section from the present work and that from ref .",
    "likewise , the extrapolation of the @xmath4 amplitude to threshold changes very little , remaining within the error in eq .",
    "( 12 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have performed an investigation of the reaction @xmath21 in the threshold region and found a good agreement with the only previous calculation @xcite for the total cross section .",
    "a reasonable agreement also exists for the differential cross sections .",
    "our predictions coincide within of 20% .",
    "if one takes into account that the authors of that work ascribed to their results an uncertainty of about @xmath24 we conclude that the present calculation can not lead to any changes in the total and differential cross section of coherent @xmath5 photoproduction on the deuteron measured in ref .   @xcite .",
    "this means that the deviation of about 20% from theoretical predictions found in that paper for the @xmath4 threshold amplitude still remains to be resolved .",
    "our calculations have shown that the difference of about @xmath69 between the free - nucleon value for the @xmath6 threshold amplitude and the experimental value can be attributed to two - body effects due to @xmath2-@xmath3 rescattering .",
