    "models for the formation of solar active regions ( ar ) tend to fall into one of several classes , largely dependent on the volume in which strong magnetic fields are generated . in one of these , magnetic flux tubes generated near the base of the convection zone become buoyant and rise through the convection zone ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an active region emerging when a flux tube passes through the solar surface .",
    "another possibility is that ars are formed as the result of the coalescence of magnetic fields generated in the bulk of the convection zone or near the solar surface ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "each of these scenarios has a distinct signature in the velocity of the plasma in the convection zone .",
    "local helioseismology @xcite potentially can be used to determine the subsurface dynamics associated with ar formation , and thus could provide evidence for or against either of these theories .",
    "this would also indirectly shed light on the location of the solar dynamo .",
    "previous studies of ar formation using local helioseismology have tended to focus on only a small number of regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . the small number of regions considered and the lack of a control group of areas of sun where no active region was emerging make it difficult to identify any subsurface properties _ unique _ to the emergence of active regions .",
    "the exception to this is the study of @xcite that considered subsurface flows of a large sample of existing active regions undergoing episodes of magnetic flux emergence , compared with a control group of active regions that had comparatively constant flux .",
    "however , this study did not include the pre - emergence stage of active region formation .",
    "the present study is based on applying helioseismic holography @xcite to samples of over 100 areas of sun where an active region subsequently emerged , and an equal number where no active region emerged .",
    "the selection of these regions was described in @xcite ( paper i ) , while an initial analysis of the travel - times inferred from helioseismic holography , focusing on the average travel - time shifts , was presented in @xcite ( paper ii ) .",
    "it was found that there are statistically significant differences in the average travel - times , as well as in the surface magnetic flux , between the samples of pre - emergence areas and quiet sun areas . these included a reduction in the mean travel - time shift of a few tenths of a second , as well as spatially antisymmetric features in both the east - west and north - south travel - time differences .",
    "the antisymmetric features are qualitatively consistent with what would be expected from a flow converging on the site of emergence , although it appears that it is not a simple converging flow .",
    "one possible interpretation is that emergence preferentially occurs at the boundaries between supergranules . in this scenario ,",
    "the emergence is not at the center of a converging flow , but between neighboring diverging flows .",
    "this could also account for the difference in the surface magnetic field , as flux tends to concentrate in the boundaries between supergranules .",
    "as interesting as what was found in is what was not found : any signature of a strong retrograde flow , or any travel - time shifts greater than of order one second .",
    "simulations of rising flux tubes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict retrograde flows with magnitudes of order 100 m s@xmath0 , while @xcite found mean travel - time reductions of order 10s . in both these cases , the results are much larger effects than were found in , but for layers in the sun significantly below the roughly 20 mm maximum depth considered here",
    ". thus it may be that there are significant changes in the emergence process between depths of approximately 60 mm and 20 mm .    in the present paper , we briefly review the selection of the data , and the analysis performed in the previous papers in this series before proceeding to an analysis of the data based on discriminant analysis .",
    "we use the full distribution of the travel - time shifts to determine the relative ability of different parameters to discriminate between the samples of pre - emergence and non - emergence .",
    "we compare the ability of a measure of the surface magnetic field to distinguish the samples with the ability of the helioseismic parameters , and examine how the surface field is influencing the helioseismic parameters .",
    "an important caveat is that here , as in , care should be taken in interpreting the nature of the holography travel - time shifts .",
    "for example , without modeling , the variation of depth of any flows or other perturbations producing the shifts is not known .",
    "the overall design of this study , including the data selection , preparation and treatment , was presented in paper i. in brief , samples from two populations are considered , `` pre - emergence '' targets ( pe ) that track a @xmath1 patch of the sun prior to the emergence of a noaa - numbered active region , and `` non - emergence '' targets ( ne ) selected for lack of emergence and lack of strong fields in the central portions of the tracked patch .",
    "the pe sample size comprises 107 targets obtained between 20012007 , matched to 107 ne targets drawn from an initially larger sample , and selected further to match the pe distributions in time and observing location on the disk .",
    "the emergence time was determined using mdi 96-minute cadence observations of the line of sight magnetic field , no selection was made for minimum - size of the numbered noaa regions that result and limits were placed to avoid extreme observing angles .",
    "data for the helioseismology originate from the global oscillations network group project ( gong ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; a full gong day ( 1664 min ) of data prior to the emergence time was tracked , and divided into five time intervals , each 6.4hr long but starting every 5.3hr , with just over an hour overlap between them .",
    "table  [ tbl : samplesize ] shows how many ne / pe had acceptable duty cycle ( @xmath2% ) for each time interval ; once duty cycle is accounted for , the sample sizes are not equal .",

    "in particular , the gong dopplergrams were first tracked and postel projected , then phase speed filters were applied .",
    "the filters , described in table  1 of @xcite , isolate waves with particular ranges in lower turning points ; these filters cover the range in lower turning point depths from about 1.4 mm ( filter td1 ) to about 23.3 mm ( filter td11 ) .",
    "the full list of depths is given in table  1 of .",
    "after filtering , center - annulus and center - quadrant local - control correlations were used to measure travel - time shifts . from these",
    ", travel - time differences and proxies for the vertical component of the flow vorticity and the horizontal flow divergence were constructed .",
    "the result was , for each time interval and each region , a spatial map of the travel - times listed in table  [ tbl : vars ] .",

    "as in , three weightings were used in the averaging : a uniform weighting , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 weightings , where @xmath23 is the angle measured counter - clockwise from the direction of solar rotation ( the @xmath24 direction ) .",
    "using this combination of weighting factors makes the analysis sensitive to both spatially symmetric and antisymmetric features in the travel - time maps . to be consistent with , we will continue to denote the spatial average with an overline , but note that only spatial averages are considered here .",
    "the accompanying magnetic data derive from mdi observations : a potential field was calculated that matches the observed line - of - sight component provided by mdi , hence providing the potential - field approximation of the radial field present over the course of the gong data , for comparison with the results of the helioseismology .",
    "the absolute value of the radial magnetic field was spatially averaged over the same 45.5 mm disk as the travel - times , and temporally averaged over each time interval .",
    "note that after accounting for duty cycle , the magnetic field variables have different sample sizes than the seismology variables because they were computed from mdi data ; only time interval 0 has a sample size not equal to 107 , where the ne sample is reduced to 106 .",
    "the analysis presented in paper ii suggests that helioseismic holography is able to detect a signature prior to the emergence time as defined in . to quantify this ability , and in particular to determine whether there is any more information available from the holographic signatures than there is from direct measurements of the surface magnetic field , discriminant analysis ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) was used .",
    "this technique classifies a measurement as belonging to the group with the highest probability density . provided the probability density",
    "is estimated accurately , it maximizes the overall rate of correct classification . in this case , the two groups are the pe and ne regions , and a region would be classified as emerging whenever the probability density estimate for the emerging regions exceeds the probability density estimate for quiet regions , for the specified property of the new region .    for the results presented here ,",
    "the probability density was estimated using a kernel method with the epanechnikov kernel and the smoothing parameter set based on its optimum value for a normal distribution @xcite .",
    "for the average unsigned flux , which is a positive definite quantity , the probability density of the logarithm was estimated .",
    "this ensures that the density estimate is zero for values of the flux less than zero , and better captures the typical tail to high values .",
    "example density estimates are presented in  [",
    "sec : results ] .    at any randomly selected point on the solar disk ,",
    "the probability of an active region emerging in a one day window is extremely small .",
    "however , for this analysis , the prior probabilities for pre - emergence and non - emergence were set equal .",
    "thus , we are not truly testing the ability of the parameters to _ predict _ the emergence of an active region , but rather we are testing whether there is a signal of emergence in the seismic analysis .",
    "the advantage to this choice is that it avoids the problem that the presence of even quite a strong signal can be masked by an extremely small prior probability .",
    "the first step in quantifying the performance of the discriminant analysis was to construct a contingency table , as shown in table  [ tbl : contingency ] . from a contingency table , there are many ways to quantify the performance of a classification scheme . because prior probabilities are assumed to be equal , but the sample sizes are not equal after accounting for the duty cycle ( see  [ sec : data ] and table  [ tbl : samplesize ] ) , we use the peirce skill score @xcite , also known as the true skill score , or hanssen and kuipers s discriminant ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparison of this with other skill scores ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of regions that were classified by the discriminant analysis to be emergences and did emerge , @xmath27 is the number of pe regions , @xmath28 is the number of regions that were classified by the discriminant analysis to be non - emergences but did emerge , and @xmath29 is the number of ne regions . as expressed above",
    ", the peirce skill score is the probability of detection ( hit rate ) minus the probability of false detection ( false alarm rate ) . changing the sample size of events or non - events",
    "does not change this score provided the rates have been accurately estimated .",
    "positive values of this skill score indicate improvement of the forecasts over both uniform ( unskilled ) forecasts and random forecasts @xcite , with a maximum score of @xmath30 for perfect forecasting , while negative scores indicate worse performance than uniform or random forecasts .",
    "crrrr & & pe & ne + observed & pe & @xmath26 & @xmath28 + & ne & @xmath31 & @xmath32 +    to further confirm the independence of the results on the varying sample sizes , the analysis was repeated using only the subset of regions that have good duty cycles for all time intervals .",
    "sample results of this investigation are shown in appendix  [ sec : duty ] .",
    "the main result of using this subset is to increase the uncertainty estimates , which is a consequence of the sample sizes being substantially reduced to 45/48 for ne / pe ; the significance of the results is thus reduced , but the interpretations remain the same .    an unbiased estimate of the skill score with an error estimate was obtained by using cross - validation @xcite and a bootstrap approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each sample ( pe and ne ) ,",
    "a bootstrap sample was constructed by drawing with replacement from the full sample .",
    "that is , a pe ( ne ) region was selected at random from the full set of pe ( ne ) regions , and this was repeated @xmath27 ( @xmath29 ) times to construct a bootstrap sample . because all the draws are from the full sample , the same region may be drawn more than once , or not at all .    to remove bias ,",
    "each member of the bootstrap sample was classified by using the remaining @xmath33 points to determine the probability density at the removed point , and repeating for all @xmath34 points in the sample , from which a contingency table and skill score were constructed .",
    "this was repeated for 1000 bootstrap samples , with the mean and standard deviation of the resulting skill scores used to estimate the skill score value and error .",
    "to determine the variables with the greatest ability to distinguish between pe and ne regions , the unbiased estimate of the peirce skill score and its uncertainty from nonparametric discriminant analysis were computed for all the variables in table  [ tbl : vars ] for each time interval and phase speed filter ( except the magnetic field , for which no filters were used ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : peirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] lists all the variables with a skill score of more than 0.27 for each time interval .",
    "the results of a monte - carlo experiment ( appendix  [ sec : mc ] ) show that it is very likely that a variable with a skill score of greater than 0.27 can truly differentiate between the populations .",
    "this cutoff is arbitrary in the sense that there are variables just below the cutoff that have essentially the same ability to discriminate ne from pe regions as variables that appear in the table .",
    "however , skill scores up to at least 0.2 can reasonably be expected due to chance for variables that have no difference between the populations .",
    "thus the threshold chosen means that the variables in the table are ones that are very likely to have a real ability to discriminate ; others with real ability may be excluded .",

    "this constancy in the performance of the unsigned field is largely because the field itself does not evolve substantially over the time in question .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr2_flux ] ( left ) shows the field 24.5hr before emergence versus the field 8.5hr before emergence .",
    "there is an extremely high correlation between the field at the two times ( pearson correlation coefficients @xmath77 ) for both the pe and ne regions , and no clear indication of evolution . when considering the change between 24.5hr and 3.2hr before emergence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr2_flux ] , right ) , there is some indication of evolution of the field , consistent with there being a few regions for which emergence began in the final six hours before the nominal emergence time ( more points lying above and to the left of the blue line ) .",
    "this trend is still weak compared to the variation among the regions considered , as is born out by the small decrease in the correlations ( pearson correlation coefficients @xmath78 ) .",

    "however , there was a bias introduced in the selection criteria for the ne compared with the pe : ne regions were required to have magnetic field consistently @xmath79 g ( see  3.2 of ) , while no such requirement was imposed for pe regions .",
    "it may simply be that the difference between the pe and ne samples results from the bias in the selection of ne compared to the pe regions .",
    "it is also possible that there is a small amount of weak magnetic flux present at the surface more than a day prior to the beginning of the clear emergence phase of active regions .",
    "this field is indistinguishable from noise in individual mdi magnetograms , but becomes apparent in averaging over large numbers .",

    "the approach to this was essentially the same as the selection of the ne regions to match the distributions in position and time of the pe regions described in : we used simulated annealing to select subsets of pe and ne regions that minimize the integrated absolute value of the difference between nonparametric density estimates for the two distributions .",
    "sixty - five regions from each sample were selected , which resulted in 5055 regions with good duty cycle in each sample .",

    "are shown in figure  [ fig : npda_field_subset ] , along with the skill score as a function of time .",
    "the skill score is consistent with zero in time intervals 03 , and compared with figure  [ fig : npda_field ] , the pe and ne distributions are very closely matched , with no remaining tail to large values of @xmath69 for the pe sample .",
    "the increase in skill score in time interval 4 is likely due to the start of emergence in a few regions .    for most of the variables that are not strongly correlated with the magnetic flux ,",
    "the skill score values have not changed substantially , but the smaller sample sizes generally lead to larger uncertainties .",
    "almost every filter and depth combination of @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 present in table  [ tbl : peirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] is also present after flux matching in table  [ tbl : subsetpeirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] , with a similar value of the skill score . for example , in time interval 0 , the skill score values @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the filters found in table  [ tbl : peirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] lie in the range @xmath118 for both the full samples and the matched flux subsets .",
    "by contrast , the mean travel - time shifts in time interval 4 have consistently lower skill scores for the matched flux subset , indicating that the correlation with the magnetic flux accounts for some of the ability of @xmath80 ( and @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) to discriminate between pe and ne regions .",
    "in addition to the best performing variables for the full samples of pe and ne regions , there are a considerable number of other variables , in a range of filters , present in table  [ tbl : subsetpeirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] .",
    "many of these are likely to be statistical anomalies , with no real ability to discriminate the pe and ne regions .",

    "qualitatively , the results are extremely similar to those shown in figures  [ fig : npda_dtxy ] , bottom and [ fig : npda_vors ] , where the full sets of regions were included .",
    "the distributions are peaked at similar values , with similar widths , leading to discriminant boundaries in approximately the same locations .",
    "the main difference is that the uncertainty in the skill score has increased slightly .",
    "thus , the ability of these variables to distinguish pe from ne regions is not a result of a difference in the average unsigned vertical field between the two samples , although it could still be a result of a different aspect of the surface field ( e.g. , the horizontal field , or small areas of strong vertical field ) .",
    "there are statistically significant differences between the properties of the pre - emergence and non - emergence samples that persist , with relatively little change , for at least a day prior to the onset of emergence .",
    "however , these differences are small , of order 1s or less in the travel - time shifts on average , thus none of the variables considered can clearly distinguish an emergence from a non - emergence for any single region ( c.f .  figs .  2 and 3 from ) .",
    "this is quite different from the results of @xcite , who found much larger travel - time reductions , although that study considered waves that propagate much deeper than were considered here .",
    "the average unsigned magnetic flux at the surface was the best discriminator between the two samples .",
    "this could be a result of the appearance of small amounts of flux at the surface , starting at least one day prior to our definition of emergence time .",
    "the mdi instrument is unable to resolve this flux in a single magnetogram , and thus it is only distinguishable when averaging over many regions .",
    "simulations of flux emergence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do exhibit this type of behavior , thus our investigation shows some support for these simulations .",
    "it is also possible that the ability of the average magnetic flux to distinguish the two samples is a result of a bias in the samples , either of solar origin , or as a result of our selection criteria .",
    "our selection of ne regions ( see ) imposed a maximum field strength allowed that was not similarly applied to the pe regions .",
    "this could have resulted in a bias between the two samples in the average flux .",
    "however , it is also possible that the difference in average flux is a result of the tendency for active regions to emerge in the same location as prior active regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and not directly related to the emergence process .    while such considerations are important if the goal is to use helioseismology to predict the emergence of active regions , our goal is simply to determine if there is a helioseismic signal of emergence .",
    "the helioseismic measures that best distinguish the pre - emergence from the non - emergence regions are mean travel - time shifts , particularly immediately prior to emergence , antisymmetric averages of north - south and east - west travel - time differences , and an antisymmetric average of the vertical vorticity .",
    "the mean travel - time shifts are correlated with the presence of surface field , and thus may not be related to subsurface properties of the emergence .",
    "this was confirmed by the reduced ability of mean travel - time shifts to distinguish pe from ne regions for subsets of the initial samples of pe and ne regions that had matched distributions of average unsigned magnetic flux .",
    "the signals in the north - south and east - west travel - time differences , and the signal in the vertical vorticity appear to not be sensitive to the surface field .",
    "thus , we believe there are differences in the subsurface flows that can be detected by helioseismology prior to the emergence of significant magnetic flux .",
    "a converging flow could qualitatively explain the signals seen in the north - south and east - west travel - time differences , but it appears that the flow pattern is not a simple converging flow",
    ". a prograde flow below the site of the emergence would produce the observed pattern in the vertical vorticity .",
    "this is perhaps related to the `` small shearing flow feature '' at a depth of 2 mm described by @xcite for ar10488 .",
    "there is no clear evidence for a retrograde flow , as would be expected from typical rising flux tube simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although these simulations end approximately 20 mm below the surface .",
    "instead , we found the vertical vorticity to be consistent with a prograde flow , and the difference in north - south travel - time differences is comparable to that in east - west travel - time differences , as would result from a converging flow .",
    "thus our results suggest that the properties of simulated rising flux tubes must change as they approach the surface , at shallower depths than are presently simulated , if this is the mechanism by which active regions form .",
    "as noted in , there are several ways in which a future investigation could improve on the present method .",
    "however , we have already found subtle but significant differences in the helioseismic signals from our samples of pre - emergence and non - emergence regions that suggest a detectable subsurface manifestation of active region formation prior to the appearance of significant surface magnetic flux .",
    "our statistical results place strong constraints on models of active region formation .",

    "because of the varying duty cycle , some regions are only present in a subset of the time intervals .",

    "the analysis was repeated for the subset of regions that had a good duty cycle for _ every _ time interval .",
    "this severely reduces the sample sizes , to 48 and 45 for pe and ne respectively .",
    "the main impact of this is an increase in the error bars , which is expected from the reduction in the sample sizes , without greatly changing the results . to illustrate this ,",
    "the right panels of figures  [ fig : npda_field ] , [ fig : npda_dtmean ] , and [ fig : npda_dtxy ] have been reproduced in figure  [ fig : segs_allgood ] with this subset .",
    "all the other plots exhibit the same behavior , thus we believe that this does not affect any of our conclusions .",
    "given the number of variables considered compared to the number of data points , one should ask the question : are these results simply a statistical fluke ? to answer this , a monte carlo experiment was performed . to represent one variable ,",
    "two random samples of 85 points ( typical of the sample sizes in  [ sec : results ] and table  [ tbl : peirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] ) each were drawn from the same normal distribution .",
    "this was repeated for 66,250 variables ( 50 times the number of active region emergence variables ) , changing only the random number seed between variables .",
    "nonparametric discriminant analysis was applied to the resulting values , and an unbiased bootstrap estimate of the peirce skill score was made for each variable .",
    "the distribution of the resulting skill scores is shown in figure  [ fig : mcboot ] , left , along with the distribution of the variables considered for active region emergence .",
    "compared with the random variables , there is a preponderance of large skill score values for the emergence variables . dividing the random variables into 50 sets of size equal to",
    "the number of emergence variables shows that the typical maximum skill score achieved is about 0.27 , so the probability of getting a skill score greater than that if there is no information in the variable is extremely small .",
    "however , the distribution of random variables and of active region emergence variables show considerable overlap below a skill score of about 0.2 .",
    "to compare with the results when the distribution of magnetic flux was matched between ne and pe regions (  [ sec : fluxmatch ] and table  [ tbl : subsetpeirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] ) , the experiment was repeated for two random samples of 50 points each .",
    "the resulting distribution of skill scores is shown in figure  [ fig : mcboot ] , right .",
    "there is still a preponderance of large skill scores for the emergence variables compared to the random variables , but it is less pronounced than for the larger sample size . again dividing the random variables into 50 sets of size equal to",
    "the number of emergence variables shows that the typical maximum skill score achieved is now about 0.34 , but was as high as 0.43 . in this case , it is no longer possible to determine whether any individual variable has any real ability to discriminate between pe and ne regions .",
    "however , it is possible to infer that there are more variables with high skill scores than would be expected from chance alone .",
    "the number of variables with skill score @xmath119 ( the value used in table  [ tbl : peirce_boot_npda_equal_n1_seg ] ) is 17 , compared with an expected number of 11 .",
    "the chance of getting at least this many variables by chance is approximately 2% .",
    "the number of variables with skill score @xmath120 is 120 , compared with an expected number of 86 .",
    "the chance of getting at least this many variables by chance is less than 2% .",
    "thus there is reason to believe that there is a difference in the helioseismology variables between pe and ne regions .    for the results presented here , the distributions were assumed to be normal , as this is a reasonable approximation to the expected noise distribution .",
    "however , to confirm the results , the monte carlo experiments were also performed drawing at random from a cauchy distribution and from a cosine distribution . for the cauchy distribution , which has longer tails than a normal distribution ,",
    "the largest skill scores obtained were less than the largest skill scores for the normal distribution .",
    "for the cosine distribution , which has shorter tails than a normal distribution , the largest skill scores were very similar to those obtained from the normal distribution . in all cases",
