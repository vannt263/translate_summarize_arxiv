    "due to the complex nature of hadronic matter it is challenging to find a comprehensive description of how quarks and gluons combine to form hadrons . in particular with the upcoming intense experimental activity dedicated to search for new exotic states , a better understanding of the conventional @xmath0 mesons is needed .",
    "+ phenomenological models that establish a link between lattice qcd and experimental data are important because they could help to reveal the connection between the hadronic mass spectrum and the underlying quark - gluon dynamics .",
    "+ in continuation of previous work by gross , milana and savkli @xcite using cst , we are developing a formalism that has potential to properly describe both light and heavy mesons , in a unified way .",
    "moreover , the model is self - consistent because the quark self - energy is calculated from the same kernel that describes the quark - antiquark interaction .",
    "recently @xcite , the dressed quark mass function and pion electromagnetic form factor in impulse approximation have been calculated using this model and it has been shown that the model is consistent with the requirements of chiral symmetry @xcite . +",
    "this work is the first application of the results of @xcite to the 1cse . in @xcite",
    "we address the problem of solving the momentum - space cst equations with the linear interaction in its nonrelativistic limit , in which the 1cse becomes the schrdinger equation , and develop a method to explicitely remove all the singularities of its kernel .",
    "the cst bound - state equation emerges when we approximate the full bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for the vertex function @xmath1 , @xmath2 with total momentum @xmath3 and relative external and internal momentum @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the dressed propagator and @xmath8 is the self - energy of quark @xmath9 .",
    "this approximation consists of keeping only the pole contributions from the propagators at @xmath10 , when the integration over @xmath11 is performed .",
    "if we symmetrize the contributions from both complex half - planes , we obtain an equation that is a three - dimensional reduction of eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) and has four contributing diagrams , depicted in fig .",
    "[ cst-bse.eps ] , each arising from placing one particle on its positive / negative energy mass - shell .            when external legs are systematically placed on - shell in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ cst-bse.eps ] , a closed set of coupled equations emerges , the four - channel spectator equation ( 4cse ) .",
    "however , to study heavy - light quark systems , with a large bound - state mass , it is sufficient to consider only the positive - energy pole contribution from the heavier particle 1 , for @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting equation , the 1cse , is represented in fig .  [ 1cs.eps ] and can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are dirac matrices of type @xmath9 ( scalar , vector , pseudoscalar ) , @xmath16 is the momentum - dependent part of the interaction , @xmath17 is the positive - energy projector and @xmath18 is the on - shell momentum of particle 1 .",
    "in this preliminary work we are interested just in the linear confining part of the potential , @xmath19 a covariant , relativistic generalization of this potential is @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in @xcite",
    "we show that although this kernel is singular when @xmath22 , when applied to any function of three - momenta , @xmath23 , one ends up with a cauchy principal value integral ( `` @xmath24 '' ) , @xmath25 . \\label{pot}\\ ] ] we also show in @xcite that the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) can be rearranged by means of a subtraction into two parts , one that is no longer singular and another one that contains a principal value singularity that can be integrated analytically .",
    "besides treating the singularity , we also perform a partial - wave decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ gamma1cs ] ) and derive a singularity - free equation for an arbitrary partial wave @xmath26 .",
    "our results extend those of @xcite in which only the @xmath27-wave case was computed .",
    "in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ gamma1cs ] ) , we use a helicity representation ( with helicity @xmath28 ) for the 1cse and expand it in terms of @xmath29 spinors @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) defined consistently with @xcite .",
    "the most general form of the 1cse for arbitrary interaction vertices and interaction kernel is @xmath32 \\!\\!\\psi_{1\\rho}(k)=\\mu \\psi_{1\\rho'}(p ) , \\label{matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is obtained from the contraction of @xmath35 with the @xmath29 spinors . in the 1cse , ( [ gamma ] )",
    "is the most general form of the vertex function for a pseudoscalar particle .",
    "+ finally , the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) , @xmath36 depend on the interaction kernel @xmath37 or @xmath38 chosen . in this work",
    "we use a mixed kernel where one parameter @xmath39 dials continously between scalar and vector interaction , while preserving the nonrelativistic limit , which only differs in a sign for both interactions : @xmath40.\\ ] ] these procedures enable us to transform the 1cse into an eigenvalue problem for the bound - state masses @xmath41 and the corresponding wave functions , which are expanded in a basis of cubic b - splines as in @xcite .            in figs .  [ without ] and [ with ] we study the convergence of the 7 lowest positive energies @xmath42 of the 1cse in the @xmath27 wave ( @xmath43 ) with increasing number of quadrature points @xmath44 . we consider a mass ratio of @xmath45 ( heavy - light meson ) , @xmath46 gev@xmath47 and @xmath48 ( pure scalar interaction ) .",
    "the results are computed with 64 b - splines . in fig .  [ with ] the last column `` nint . ''",
    "refers to the results obtained with the adaptive integration routine `` nintegrate '' from the software mathematica 9.0 .",
    "+ we observe a much faster convergence with the singularity - free version of the 1cse than with the previous unsubtracted version , which is also reflected in a reduction of the computing time to 1/6 to obtain the same accuracy .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ higher ] , the 5 lowest positive energies @xmath50 of the 1cse for partial waves up to @xmath49 are presented , for the same set of parameters used in figs .",
    "[ without ] and [ with ] .",
    "even though pseudoscalar particles do not have high orbital angular momentum , these results serve as an important numerical test , before attempting the study of other structures for the two quark vertex @xmath1 , where the high @xmath26 equations become more complex .",
    "for @xmath51 we did not obtain converged results with the unsubtracted version of 1cse , not even after increasing the number of splines .",
    "the subtraction technique fixes this problem because the integrand becomes a smoother function .",
    "+ in the results of figs .",
    "[ without ] , [ with ] , and [ 1cspartial ] we neglect retardation and use the simplest replacement @xmath52 , but we have already performed test calculations with retardation and obtained good convergence .",
    "the main conclusion from this work shows that the numerical method developed in @xcite for the non - relativistic equation is also applicable to the relativistic 1cse",
    ". future work will generalize it to more complex equations such as the 4cse , necessary for realistic light meson systems .",
