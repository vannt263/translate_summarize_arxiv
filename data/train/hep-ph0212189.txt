    "we conclude that the energy dependence of the angular distribution , given by @xmath75 in absolute terms , is reasonably well reproduced .",
    "a further improvement would require the treatment of ( i ) large angle and recoil corrections , ( ii ) dependence on jet axis definition ( iii ) heavy quark contribution and hadron mass effects .",

    "these formulae can be represented as sums over dipole radiation terms ( [ 4.2 ] ) , the same as in qed , modified by the proper colour factors for quarks and gluons .",
    "in addition , there is an effect of parton branching which modifies these formulae by the `` cascading factor '' @xmath75 , the logarithmic derivative of the multiplicity . for fixed resolution parameter @xmath1",
    ", this factor does not modify the basic angular distribution in a wide range . on the other hand",
    ", it implies an additional dependence on energy and/or jet resolution .",
    "the predicted dependence on @xmath62 has been clearly established for two - jet events .",
