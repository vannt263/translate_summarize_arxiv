    "we find that filament instability influences a large portion of halos in the universe throughout cosmic age .",

    "this parametrization does not allow for a heating term from photo ionization and uv radiation , but allows for modified cooling in the presence of external radiation fields that alters the equilibrium ionization state of the gas @xcite .",

    "we further assume that the cooling function , @xmath55 does not change significantly due to the change of temperature of the lagrangian mass element , except near @xmath56 and is necessary for an analytic solution to be possible .",

    "we wish to determine where and how this gas is thermalized , particularly in the presence of cooling , which softens the effective eos of the gas .",
