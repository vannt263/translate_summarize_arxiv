    "since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in optical traps , much effort has been devoted to the study of spinor superfluid @xcite . with the degree of freedom of spin",
    ", spinor superfluid has much richer phases than scalar superfluid as it has both superfluid order and spin textures . however , most spinor superfluids studied till now carry both spin current and mass current",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether these two currents can decouple and further whether a pure spin current which has no mass current can flow frictionlessly .",
    "our motivation also originates from condensed matter physics , in which the concept of spin superconductor @xcite , formed by the cooper - like pairs of electrons and holes and carrying spin super - current , is proposed .",
    "it is interesting to have these ideas realized in the field of cold atoms .    in this work we focus on the unpolarized spin-1 bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , where the pure spin current can be generated by applying a small magnetic gradient .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that a planar pure spin current in such a system is always unstable as the @xmath0 components can collide into the @xmath1 component destroying the spin current .",
    "we find that the pure spin current can be stabilized with the quadratic zeeman effect and become a super - flow .",
    "furthermore , we propose a scheme to create pure spin current at the ground state , thus free from the issue of instability .",
    "our scheme utilizes the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "specifically , we study a spin-1 bec with rashba spin - orbit coupling confined in a two - dimensional harmonic trap , and numerically find the ground state of the system . for antiferromagnetic interactions ,",
    "opposite vortices appear in the @xmath0 components with equal amplitude when the spin - orbit coupling is weak .",
    "such a state carries pure spin current and no mass current .",
    "this spin current is a super - flow as it is the ground state and must be stable .",
    "we note that there has been a lot of theoretical and experimental work on the counterflow of two species bec @xcite . for two miscible becs with counterflow",
    ", it is found that there is a critical relative speed between the two species , beyond which the state is dynamically unstable @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the instability can lead to proliferation of solitons @xcite and quantum turbulence @xcite .",
    "this kind of counterflow is very similar to a spin current but it is not for two reasons : ( 1 ) theoretically , if we regard the two species as two components of a pseudo - spin , this pseudo - spin has no su(2 ) rotational symmetry as the number of bosons in each species is conserved .",
    "( 2 ) experimentally , it is hard to control the number of bosons in each component to create a spin current that has no mass current .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ planar ] , we first study the stability of a spin-1 planar counterflow .",
    "we identify the mechanisms associated with the instabilities , and find that the quadratic zeeman effect can stabilize such a planar flow .",
    "we then study the similar situation in the circular geometry in sec .",
    "[ circular ] .",
    "the pure spin current consists of a vortex and anti - vortex in the @xmath2 components .",
    "the experimental schemes to realize the stable pure spin current is discussed in sec .",
    "[ expe ] . finally , we briefly summarize our main results in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the dynamics of a spin-1 bec in free space is governed by the mean field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the components of the macroscopic wave function .",
    "@xmath6 is the total density , @xmath7 is the spin density vector and @xmath8 is the spin operator vector with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) being the three pauli matrices in the spin-1 representation .",
    "the collisional interactions include a spin - independent part @xmath11 and a spin - dependent part @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the @xmath14-wave scattering length for spin-1 atoms in the symmetric channel of total spin @xmath15 .",
    "we consider a spin current state of the above gp equation with the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the density of the uniform bec .",
    "the requirement of equal chemical potential leads to @xmath18 . in the case",
    "where @xmath19 , this state carries a pure spin current : the total mass current is zero as it has equal mass counterflow while the spin current is nonzero .",
    "it is instructive to first consider the special case when there is no counterflow , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the excitation spectra are found to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , respectively , with @xmath24 .",
    "so for antiferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath25 ) , all branches of the spectra are real and there is a double degeneracy in one branch of the spectra .",
    "the phonon excitations give two sound velocities , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , corresponding to the speeds of density wave and spin wave , respectively .",
    "however , the existence of phonon excitation does not mean that the pure spin current ( @xmath28 ) is a super - flow as we can not obtain the current with @xmath28 from the state with @xmath29 by a galilean transformation .",
    "the stability of the spin current has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case @xmath30 .",
    "it is found that , for the antiferromagnetic interaction case ( @xmath25 ) , the excitation spectrum of the @xmath1 component always has nonzero imaginary part in the long wavelength limit as long as there is counterflow between the two components , and the imaginary excitations in the @xmath0 components only appear for a large enough relative velocity @xmath31 . for the ferromagnetic interaction case ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "both excitation spectra of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 components have nonzero imaginary parts for any relative velocity .",
    "this means that the pure spin current can not be stable in any cases .    for the general non - collinear case ( @xmath33 ) and antiferromagnetic interaction , the excitation spectrum for the @xmath1 component",
    "is found to be @xmath34 we see here that as long as the momenta of the two components are not exactly parallel , i.e. , @xmath35 is not exactly equal to @xmath36 , then @xmath37 , and there is always dynamical instability for the long wavelength excitations",
    ".    therefore , the spin current in eq .",
    "( [ scurrent ] ) is generally unstable and not a super - flow .",
    "this instability originates from the interaction process described by @xmath38 in the second quantized hamiltonian .",
    "this energetically favored process converts two particles in the @xmath0 components , respectively , into two stationary particles in the @xmath1 component . to suppress such a process and achieve a stable pure spin current",
    ", one can utilize the quadratic zeeman effect . with the quadratic zeeman effect of negative coefficient",
    ", the hamiltonian adopts an additional term @xmath39 ( @xmath40 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "this term does not change the energy of the @xmath1 component , but lowers the energy of the other two components @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", there arises a barrier for two atoms in the @xmath0 components scattering to the @xmath1 component , and the scattering process is thus suppressed .",
    "the above intuitive argument can be made more rigorous and quantitative .",
    "consider the case @xmath19 .",
    "with the quadratic zeeman term , the excitation spectrum for the @xmath1 component changes to @xmath41 so as long as @xmath42 , long wavelength excitations will be stable for the @xmath1 component . from the excitation of the @xmath1 component",
    ", one can obtain a critical relative velocity of the spin current , @xmath43 .",
    "there is another nonzero critical velocity @xmath31 determined by the excitations of the @xmath0 components .",
    "the overall critical velocity of the system is the smaller one of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , below the critical relative velocity @xmath46 , the pure spin current is stable and a super - flow .",
    "the experimental scheme to realize such a zeeman effect will be discussed in sec .",
    "in the cylindrical geometry , we consider a pure spin current formed by two vortices with opposite circulation in the @xmath0 components . from similar arguments , one can expect that interaction will make such a current unstable . inspired by the quadratic zeeman effect method above , we propose to use spin - orbit coupling to stabilize it .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling can be viewed as a momentum - dependent effective magnetic field that exerts only on the @xmath0 components . therefore , it is possible that spin - orbit coupling lowers the energy of @xmath0 components , and consequently suppresses the interaction process leading to the instability .",
    "the model of spin-1 bec subject to rashba spin - orbit coupling can be described by the following energy functional , @xmath47= & \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\bigg\\{\\sum_{\\alpha}\\frac{\\hbar^{2}|\\nabla\\psi_{\\alpha}|^{2}}{2m}+\\rho v(r)+\\frac{c_{0}}{2}\\rho^{2 } + \\frac{c_{2}}{2}\\mathbf{s}^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\gamma\\langle s_xp_y - s_yp_x\\rangle\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the density , @xmath49 is the trapping potential , and @xmath50 is the strength of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath51 is the expectation value taken with respect to the three component wave function @xmath52 .",
    "the strength of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath50 defines a characteristic length @xmath53 , and can be rescaled to be dimensionless with respect to the harmonic oscillator length @xmath54 .",
    "then we characterize the strength of spin - orbit coupling with the dimensionless quantity @xmath55 .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling of rashba type here can be generated in various ways , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the above model can describe a spin-1 bec of @xmath56na confined in a two - dimensional harmonic trap .",
    "assume the atom number is about @xmath57 .",
    "using the estimate of scattering lengths @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xcite , with @xmath60 being the bohr radius , the ground state of spin-1 @xmath56na should be antiferromagnetic because @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "previous studies of spin-1 bec with rashba spin - orbit coupling mostly focus on the strong spin - orbit coupling regime , where the ground state is found to be the plane wave phase or the stripe phase , for ferromagnetic interaction and antiferromagnetic interaction , respectively @xcite . here",
    "we are interested in the antiferromagnetic interaction case and the weak spin - orbit coupling regime ( @xmath61 ) , and calculate the ground state wave function of the energy functional with the method of imaginary time evolution .     at the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ energy ] ) for a bec of @xmath56na confined in a 2d harmonic trap .",
    "the particle number is @xmath57 , the frequency of the trap is @xmath62 hz , and the dimensionless spin - orbit coupling strength is @xmath63 .",
    "the units of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 axes are @xmath66.,width=321 ]    we find that when the spin - orbit coupling is weak ( @xmath61 ) , the ground state wave function has the form @xmath67 with @xmath68 and all @xmath69 real .",
    "the ground state is shown in fig . [ wf ] .",
    "such a ground state consists of an anti - vortex in the @xmath70 component and a vortex in the @xmath71 component .",
    "the @xmath1 component does not carry angular momentum . since @xmath72 , the net mass current vanishes .    the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ ground ] ) can be understood in the single particle level . in terms of the ladder operators of spin and angular momentum",
    ", the spin - orbit coupling term reads @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the ladder operator of spin , and @xmath75 is the creation operator of the left ( right ) circular quanta @xcite .",
    "when the spin - orbit coupling is very weak ( @xmath61 ) , its effect can be accounted for in a perturbative way . from the ground state @xmath76 ,",
    "the first order correction to the wave function for small @xmath50 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes a state with spin quantum number @xmath79 and orbital magnetic quantum number @xmath80 .",
    "one immediately sees that @xmath81 has angular momentum @xmath82 and @xmath83 has angular momentum @xmath84 . besides , the amplitudes of both @xmath81 and @xmath83 are proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "there exits a continuity equation for spin density and spin current , which is @xmath86 the spin current density tensor @xmath87 ( @xmath88 denotes the spin component ) is defined as @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 and c.c .",
    "means the complex conjugate .",
    "the second part in @xmath91 is induced by the spin - orbit coupling .    by the definition in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) , the spin current density carried by the ground state ( [ ground ] ) is @xmath92 from both analytical and numerical results of the wave function , @xmath93 , so @xmath94 roughly points in the @xmath95 direction , while @xmath96 almost points in the @xmath97 direction .",
    "@xmath98 represents a flow whose amplitude has rotational symmetry . from the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ current ] , we see that @xmath98 is a counter - clockwise flow .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath94 and @xmath96 are of the same order , both proportional to @xmath85 , while that of @xmath98 , proportional to @xmath99 , is much smaller .",
    "it is evident that the state in eq .",
    "( [ ground ] ) carries no mass current and only pure spin current .",
    "since the spin current is in the ground state , it must be stable . in this way",
    ", we have realized a superfluid of pure spin current , or a pure spin super - current .",

    "the length of the arrows represents the strength of the spin current .",
    "the arrow length of different colors is not to scale .",

    "in this section , we propose the experimental schemes to generate and detect the pure spin currents discussed in sec .",
    "[ planar ] and sec .",
    "[ circular ] .    the planar pure spin current can be easily generated . by applying a magnetic field gradient ,",
    "the two components @xmath0 will be accelerated in opposite directions and a pure spin current is generated as done in refs .",
    "@xcite . to stabilize this spin current",
    ", one needs to generate the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "we apply an oscillating magnetic field @xmath101 with the frequency @xmath102 being much larger than the characteristic frequency of the condensate , e.g. , the chemical potential @xmath103 .",
    "the time averaging removes the linear zeeman effect ; only the quadratic zeeman effect remains .",
    "the coefficient of the quadratic zeeman effect from the second - order perturbation theory is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the land @xmath105-factor of the atom , @xmath106 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath107 is the hyperfine energy splitting @xcite . for the @xmath108 manifold of @xmath109rb , @xmath110 , so the coefficient of the quadratic zeeman effect is negative .    the circular flow in sec .",
    "[ circular ] may find prospective realizations in two different systems : cold atoms and exciton bec .",
    "in cold atoms , we consider a system consisting of a bec of @xmath56na confined in a pancake trap , where the confinement in the @xmath111 direction is so tight that one can treat the system effectively as two dimensional .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling can be induced by two different methods .",
    "one is by the exertion of a strong external electric field @xmath112 in the @xmath111 direction . due to the relativistic effect",
    ", the magnetic moment of the atom will experience a weak spin - orbit coupling , where the strength @xmath113 . here",

    "e.g. , @xmath117 of @xmath57 atoms , using the typical parameters of @xmath56na bec , the estimated electric field is of the same order of magnitude as the vacuum breakdown field . for atoms with smaller mass or larger magnetic moment",
    ", the required electric field can be lowered .",
    "another method of realizing spin - orbit coupling is to exploit the atom laser interaction , where strong spin - orbit coupling can be created in principle @xcite . in exciton bec systems , as the effective mass of exciton is much smaller than that of atom , the required electric field is four to five orders of magnitude smaller , which is quite feasible in experiments @xcite .",
    "the vortex and anti - vortex in the @xmath0 components can be detected by the method of time of flight .",
    "first one can split the three spin components with the stern - gerlach effect .",
    "the appearance of vortex or anti - vortex in the @xmath0 components is signaled by a ring structure in the time of flight image .",
    "after a sufficiently long time of expansion , the ring structure should be clearly visible .",
    "in summary , we have studied the stability of a pure spin current of a spin-1 bec . in the planar flow",
    ", the system always suffers from dynamical instability .",
    "the origin of the instability is the interaction process that converts two particles in the @xmath0 components into the @xmath1 component .",
    "based on this , we propose a method to stabilize the pure spin current by utilizing the quadratic zeeman effect . in the circular flow , we have proposed to use spin - orbit coupling to make the pure spin current stable . for weak spin - orbit coupling , we have found that the ground state of the system is a superfluid of pure spin current . the experimental schemes to realize and detect these pure spin currents",
