    "it is widely accepted by the scientific community that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion , well established by numerous cosmological observations @xcite . the responsible for this accelerated expansion",
    "is thought to be a missing dark component with negative pressure dubbed as dark energy ( de ) . combined analysis of different cosmological observations",
    "indicate that about 73@xmath3 of the universe consists of de , while the other dark component , i.e. dark matter ( dm ) , represents about the 24@xmath3 of the universe , with the remaining part made by baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "many different de models have been proposed to explain this accelerated expansion , even if most of them can not explain properly all the features of universe .",
    "the dynamical nature of de can be originated by various fields , although a complete description needs a deeper understanding of the underlying theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) .",
    "+ an interesting attempt made in order to better understand the nature of de is the proposal of the so - called agegraphic de ( ade ) .",
    "this model was proposed by cai @xcite to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of quantum gravity .",
    "the ade model assumes that the observed de comes from the space - time and matter field fluctuations present in the universe .",
    "the original ade has the following expression for the energy density @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant , @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 representing the gravitational constant ) is the reduced planck mass and @xmath9 is the age of the universe , defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the hubble parameter and @xmath12 is a scale factor which is function of the cosmic time @xmath13 .",
    "+ the original ade model suffers from the difficulty to describe appropriately the matter - dominated epoch , for this reason a new version of ade was subsequently proposed by wei and cai @xcite : the time scale they choose for their model was the conformal time @xmath14 instead of the age of the universe @xmath9 , yielding the new - agegraphic de ( nade ) model .",
    "the energy density @xmath4 of the nade is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath14 is the conformal time , which is defined as : @xmath16    the nade model has some new features respect to the original ade and , for this reason , it is able to overcome some unsatisfactory points which are present in the ade model .",
    "+ the agegraphic models of de have been also investigated in ample details ( see @xcite and references therein ) . + an important quantity studied in order to check the stability of a given model , namely the squared speed of sound @xmath17 , is defined as : @xmath18 the sign of @xmath17 is important for stability of a background evolution .",
    "a negative value implies a classical instability of a given perturbation in general relativity .",
    "myung @xcite has observed that @xmath17 for hde is always negative for the future event horizon as ir cut - off , while for chaplygin gas and tachyon , it is observed to be non - negative .",
    "kim et al .",
    "@xcite found that the squared speed of sound for ade is always negative leading to the instability of the perfect fluid for the model .",
    "moreover , it was found that the ghost qcd de model is unstable @xcite .",
    "recently , sharif and jawad @xcite have shown that interacting new hde is characterized by negative @xmath17 .",
    "+ a great interest has been recently poned to the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) and its consequences @xcite since the heisenberg uncertainty principle is not expected to be satisfied anymore when quantum gravitational effects become more important .",
    "+ even though the gup has its origins in the string theory @xcite , the gup provides the minimal length scale , i.e. the planck scale @xmath19 , and it may play a role of evolution of the universe . especially , we expect that this can modify significantly the evolution of early universe at the planck scale and inflation .",
