    "the hydrodynamic behavior of multimode laser systems has been recognized long ago  @xcite , but it is on the platform of semiconductor exciton - polaritons that a systematic investigation of the hydrodynamics of photonic systems has been performed @xcite .",

    "thanks to the photonic component , the microcavity polariton is much lighter than the bare exciton , which enhances the coherence properties . thanks to the excitonic component , polaritons show a significant interaction strength .",
    "being bosonic particles , microcavity polaritons can show long range phase coherence in the quantum degenerate regime , giving rise to superfluid @xcite properties , such as quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "the photonic component also introduces losses , which makes it so far impossible to achieve fully equilibrated bose - einstein condensation . in order to compensate for the finite polariton life time",
    ", particles have to be injected .",
    "the two main schemes are resonant and nonresonant excitation . in the former regime , the velocity of the polariton fluid can be tuned by varying the angle of the excitation laser . with this pumping scheme ,",
    "superfluidity according to the landau criterion ( absence of scattering off defects ) @xcite and the nucleation of quantized vortices @xcite as well as solitons @xcite have been experimentally observed . despite the finite polariton life time , the observed phenomenology in those experiments was close to the equilibrium behavior .    from a conceptual viewpoint ,",
    "the main disadvantage of resonant excitation is the fact that the pumping laser fixes the phase of the quantum fluid , which excludes the study of superfluidity in the sense of linear response or metastable superflow .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the most precise and quantitative definition of superfluid @xmath0 and normal @xmath1 fractions involves the response of the quantum gas to a weak transverse vector potential @xmath2 as analyzed in ref .  .",
    "for a spatially homogeneous system of density @xmath3 , the normal fraction @xmath1 can be defined as @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the effective mass and @xmath6 is the susceptibility tensor relating the average transverse current to the applied vector field in fourier space .",

    "summarising our numerical findings , we can conclude that the definitions and lose their physical interpretation in terms of normal and superfluid fractions in the presence of driving and decay . for what concerns the definition of the superfluid fraction",

    "for the case of a disordered potential , however , the superfluid fraction shows an expected behavior as a function of disorder strength , starting from one at zero disorder and falling to zero for stronger disorder .    for other potential profiles",

    "the behavior of the superfluid fraction even differs more dramatically from the equilibrium one , showing large oscillations as function of the external potential strength ( see fig . [ fig5]c ) .    at first , the definition of the normal fraction , based on the current response of the system , could be thought to be more robust with respect to the nonequilibrium condition .",
    "our numerical analysis however strongly contradicts this .",
    "already in the case of the disordered potential , where the superfluid fraction behaves reasonably , the normal fraction does not show the expected behavior .",
    "we also attribute the failure of the equilibrium definition of the superfluid fraction to the presence of currents in the steady state .",
    "these currents invalidate the physical picture that the current response is due to a limited stiffness of the condensate phase .",
    "when currents are present in the steady state , also a redistribution of the density will contribute to the current response .",
    "the interplay between the density redistribution and the steady state currents can then even lead to negative normal fraction , as we observed in the case of the disordered potential landscape ( fig . [",
    "the conclusion of our numerical findings is negative : the equilibrium definitions for superfluid and normal fractions no longer give meaningful results out of equilibrium in the presence of external potentials that induce currents .",
