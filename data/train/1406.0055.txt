    "how to track demand when the time - to - build retards capacity expansion ? when to invest and how much ?",
    "we answer these questions with a model of irreversible investment . in this model ,",
    "the objective of the decision - maker is to minimize the total discounted social cost .",
    "that is , the decision - maker maximizes the standard microeconomic social surplus .",
    "we are able to show in particular that the solution is implementable as a competitive equilibrium .",
    "we are able to calculate explicit , compact , decision rules .    in many capitalistic industries ,",
    "construction delays are essential . in this paper",
    ", we focus on electricity generation . in this sector",
    ", construction delays can be considerable : they could be only one year for a small wind - farm but could be three years for a gas turbine and eight to ten years for a nuclear plant .",
    "the scenarios of the evolution of demand with their trends , their drag force , and their stochastic parts require particular attention . to this purpose",
    ", we develop the comparative statics and economic interpretations for three demand models applied to electricity generation .",
    "the intercept of the price sensitive demand function follows either an arithmetic brownian motion as in @xcite , or a geometric brownian motion as in @xcite and @xcite , or the cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) model .",
    "the latter is a mean - reverting process , and , to our knowledge , no real options investment model exists in the literature with time - to - build and a process of this type . the basic existence and regularity results",
    "are provided in a companion paper ( @xcite ) , but we simplify the specification for the sake of calculability .",
    "an exact decision rule facilitates the clear understanding of the effects at play .",
    "the decision rule stipulates what the committed capacity should be , that is , the installed capacity plus capacity under construction .",
    "the action rule , given the current conditions , is that the committed capacity must not fall below the best predictor of demand after the delay , minus two biases .",
    "the first bias is a pure discounting bias unrelated to uncertainty : because the investment is paid for upfront but only produces after the delay , the required committed capacity is reduced .",
    "the second one is a precautionary bias where a risk aversion index is multiplied by local volatility .    because of this decomposition , we find the following qualitative results . for investment with a long construction horizon",
    ", we find that uncertainty has very little importance compared to the trend of demand growth .",
    "thus , an error on the long - term trend is much more harmful than an error on volatility . for investment with a short construction horizon ,",
    "the opposite is true : decision - makers should pay greater attention to volatility .",
    "we also illustrate the practical importance of a possible saturation of the demand with the cir model .",
    "the investors behavior is very different depending on whether demand is above or below the long - run average , or target . when demand is above the target , the investor is almost insensitive to the current demand , except if the return speed is very slow .",
    "below the target , the comparison between the time - to - build and the expected time - to - target is critical : if the time - to - build is longer , then the optimal committed capacity is practically the target itself minus the biases ; if the time - to - build is shorter , then the investors observe the process and invest progressively .",
    "the literature on the topic provides a number of insights .",
    "table  [ tab : literature ] provides a tentative classification .",
    "the competitive pressure matters : competition kills the value of waiting and thus accelerates investment . @xcite and @xcite follow this line of thought .",
    "we exclusively use a competitive market and show that this effect is completely internalized .",
    "the seminal work @xcite on the option to wait in the case of irreversible decisions shows that uncertainty has a negative effect on investment .",
    "strong support for this result is that with greater volatility , investment is triggered by a higher current product price , i.e. a smaller probability of a market downturn .",
    "several extensions provide conditions under which this result does not hold or might be mitigated .",
    "construction delays , that is , the time between the decision and the availability of the new capacity , have attracted the attention of economists . in particular , the models in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite exhibit situations where an increase in uncertainty leads to an increase in investment .",
    "the models that exhibit a positive effect on investment from an increase in uncertainty , do so only for a specific range of parameters . besides , the quantitative effects are very small .",
    "@xcite show in their simulations that when the uncertainty on demand is multiplied by five , then the investment threshold moves only by 1% .",
    "and as the authors themselves point out , the investment thresholds are nearly independent of the level of uncertainty .",
    "the large effects found in @xcite are reconsidered in @xcite .    in @xcite , a paper with which we share most of the modeling choices , the production is flexible , although the capacity accumulation is not .",
    "investors keep the choice to produce only when it is profitable , and thus the rigidity of investment is attenuated by the option to produce or not .",
    "the capacity reserves are all the more profitable the longer the time - to - build . in consequence",
    ", uncertainty tends to increase the investment rate .",
    "this paper is significant because of the way it integrates meaningful economic questions , and the numerical simulations are instructive .    as far as electricity production is concerned , the flexibility of the base production is limited either for technological reasons ( nuclear plants ) or",
    "because the fixed cost per idle period are important ( coal- or gas - fired power plants ) . in which case , the cost difference between producing or not is narrow .",
    "our approach fills a gap in the literature .",
    ".papers on investment with uncertainty and time - to - build . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this paper is organized as follows .",
