    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite as a major technique for one - dimensional quantum systems provides a variational method in the space of matrix - product states @xcite .",
    "the key idea of dmrg comprises the repeated basis truncation by density matrix projection in an iteratively enlarged system .",
    "this idea turned out to be extraordinary successful beyond the original purpose of computing the low - energy spectrum of quantum chains with short - range interactions @xcite .",
    "finite - temperature properties of quantum chains can be obtained by mapping the one - dimensional quantum system to a two - dimensional classical lattice via trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix dmrg method ( tmrg ) @xcite yields the finite temperature properties of infinite - sized quantum chains by applying a dmrg algorithm to the transfer matrix of such a corresponding two - dimensional lattice in order to find the highest contributing eigenvalues .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different method : the _ quantum corner transfer matrix dmrg ( qctmrg ) _ for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of finite one - dimensional quantum systems is a variant of nishino s corner transfer matrix dmrg ( ctmrg ) for classical systems @xcite . here , both calculating the partition sum and obtaining the reduced density matrix is just one step and does not involve finding eigenvectors of large transfer matrices .",
    "thus , ctmrg performs drastically better than the tmrg method for classical systems .",
    "can we benefit from the ideas of the ctmrg in the quantum case ?",
    "in contrast to the classical models treated with ctmrg so far , two substantial differences arise in dealing with a trotter decomposition :    * a significant _ anisotropy _ due to the existence of a well - distinguished real space and a trotter direction .",
    "* calculation of the trace in order to obtain the partition function demands _ periodic boundary conditions _ of the two - dimensional plane .",
    "both aspects will be considered our qctmrg approach . in this paper , we present the qctmrg algorithm and its essential features and close with first results and a discussion of the method s performance .",
    "we consider one - dimensional quantum chains of length @xmath0 where the hamiltonian @xmath1 only includes nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "generically , the partition function of such a quantum chain does not factorize because the neighboring interaction terms do not commute .",
    "this difficulty has been overcome by the trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite which maps the partition function of the quantum chain onto a partition function of a two - dimensional classical chequerboard model .",
    "a variant was introduced by sirker and klmper @xcite where the partition function @xmath2^{m/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , is decomposed into a trace over a product of imaginary - time propagators . here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are left and right shift operators . note that because of translational invariance , @xmath6=0 $ ] .",
    "the decomposition with shift operators overcomes disadvantages of the common chequerboard decomposition because the spatial periodicity of the lattice is one site @xcite .",
    "yet , the qctmrg algorithm as described in the subsequent section can be adapted to the chequerboard decomposition with only minor changes .    as a benefit from the factorization , we are able to insert identities of the form @xmath7 pictured as slices of discrete temperature or imaginary time , where the chain state @xmath8 is the tensor product of local quantum states @xmath9 at site @xmath10 .",

    "periodic boundary conditions correspond to the trace in the calculation of the partition function .",
    "they are physically essential in trotter direction .",
    "we are , however , free to choose open boundary conditions in real space direction .",
    "this choice significantly reduces computational effort because the tensor - dimensionality of the corner tiles is now three rather than four in the case of real - space periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , free sites at both real space edges will be integrated out , whereas the edge states regarding trotter direction are left as degrees of freedom in order to permit periodical closing",

    "those eigenstates with large eigenvalues will dominate because the partition function is nothing but the trace over the reduced density matrix .",

    "even chain lengths appear as the natural choice in the renormalization procedure .",
    "chains with an odd number of sites have a well - defined central site which might give better results .",
    "we find the energy expectation value to lie for even systems below and for odd systems above the infinite - system value .",
    "the low - energy spectrum of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain involves spin-1/2 spinons which can be identified with quantum domain walls .",

    "there is no spin singlet ground state and so always a spinon `` excitation '' is present . in the domain wall picture",
    ", there is always a kink present .",
    "for this reason , we expect the chains with an even number of sites to possess a lower local energy than chains with an odd number of sites .",

    "a crucial attribute for the qctmrg algorithm is the fixed relation between system size and temperature during the renormalization loops .",
    "this condition sets the focus of the method to finite size systems , in contrast to the tmrg .",
    "yet , a significant advantage in computational resources would make the qctmrg an interesting choice for low - temperature studies of very large systems where finite - size effects play a marginal role .",
    "for a view on the algorithm s running time and storage use , we studied the scaling behaviour with the number of states kept @xmath57 of the different steps in the algorithm .",
    "we find the algorithm to take asymptotically @xmath87 elementary floating point operations ( flop ) and a storage use of order @xmath88 floating point numbers for large @xmath57 .",
    "however , most of the time is spent in matrix - matrix - multiplications operations where a naive approach would give a running time of @xmath89 flop for multiplication of two @xmath90 matrices .",
    "in contrast to this , the fastest algorithm currently known has an asymptotic running - time of @xmath91 flop @xcite .",
    "so we expect the running - time to scale asymptotically with well - below fourth order in @xmath57 in a clever implementation .    in case of the tmrg algorithm ,",
    "the by - far most time consuming part is finding the largest eigenvalues of the transfer - matrix .",
    "we , thus , expect the asymptotic scaling behaviour to be dominated by the employed arnoldi method which performs with between @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94 the cost of a certain matrix - vector product when @xmath90 is the size of the matrix . in our case",
    ", the necessary matrix - vector product has a cost of @xmath88 flop and the total matrix has a basis of size @xmath95 .",
    "we thus expect the total running - time to vary between @xmath96 worst case and @xmath88 best case .",
    "further reduction might be achieved when clever algorithms for matrix multiplications are implemented .",
    "the storage scales with the size of the system - block - transfer - matrix ( @xmath97 numbers ) .    from the theoretical point of view , the qctmrg and the tmrg algorithms have similar running - times in the large-@xmath57 limit",
    ". the tmrg algorithm will be favorable in those cases where the arnoldi method reaches a fast convergence .",
    "for some ill - posed problems , however , the qctmrg algorithm might have an advantage .",
    "the tmrg algorithm is the clear winner when storage usage is a sensible quantity .    in our implementation of both methods , we observed a roughly similar running time of both algorithms for different number of preserved states @xmath57 .",
    "the storage use was , indeed , higher in the qctmrg algorithm .",
    "yet , we still face some fundamental challenges of the qctmrg algorithm in addition to the advantages of tmrg concerning the use of system resources .",
    "as already mentioned above , the quantum character of the system enforces periodical boundary conditions in trotter direction which makes the two - dimensional corner transfer - matrix from nishino s ctmrg a three - dimensional tensor in the case of qctmrg .",
    "this is the reason behind an increase in running - time and storage which is crucial and partly destroys the advantages from the development of ctmrg over tmrg .",
    "another more subtle point involves the spectra of the reduced density matrices from the renormalization procedure .",
    "consider the limit @xmath98 which is close to the starting point of tmrg and qctmrg where @xmath99 is small . here",
    ", the local transfer - matrix of the trotter decomposition reduces to @xmath100 which means that the initial spin configuration will not be changed by the transfer - matrix .",
    "now , we consider a trotter decomposition for infinite temperature or vanishing @xmath101 .",
    "the chosen graphical representation depicts the kronecker symbols as lines passing through the transfer - matrix plaquettes .",
    "if the system is periodically closed in trotter direction and has open boundaries in space direction , we can imagine the paths as non - interacting lines around a cylinder .",
    "this depicts the trace from the partition sum .    building a reduced density matrix introduces a vertical or horizontal cut into the system .",
    "consider the case of a cut in trotter direction which corresponds to the cut in tmrg .",
    "one `` spin path '' has been cut through while all the others stay intact , _",
    "i.e. _ they still are summed out in the reduced density matrix .",
    "only the intersected thread determines the eigenspectrum of the reduced density matrix . with a straightforward calculation",
    "we find one or two degenerate eigenvalues depending on whether we intersect an odd or even number of sites .",
    "all other eigenvalues remain zero in this case .",
    "this turns the renormalization step , which is a truncation of basis states , to be highly effective . in a system with small @xmath101",
    "we still find a small number of dominating eigenvalues which lead a dmrg renormalization to success .",
    "the opposite situation is faced when the cut is made in space direction .",
    "if the underlying spin chain has @xmath102 spins , the density matrix will `` cut ''",
    "as much as @xmath0 paths .",
    "all @xmath0 spins act separately and , thus , all spin configurations have the same contribution to the partition function .",
    "merely the remaining degrees of freedom will be summed out .",
    "consequently , we are left with a reduced density matrix which has @xmath103 degenerate eigenstates when @xmath104 is the spin size .",
    "no effective truncation can be found .",
    "the situation in cases with high , but finite temperature is certainly less ill - posed .",
    "though , still we expect a slow decay of the spectrum of the reduced transfer matrix .",
    "this scenario explains why the calculated qctmrg data shows a most significant deviation from the expected values at higher temperatures .",
    "starting with a small system size the algorithm can still handle the system with high precision . for larger system sizes ,",
    "a truncation has to be done during the renormalization step which can not be optimal since the reduced density matrix will still have a flat spectrum . at even larger system sizes and lower temperatures",
    "the spectrum of horizontal density matrix will become acceptably well - behaved again .",
    "we developed a new method for finite - temperature studies of one - dimensional quantum systems based on the ctmrg of nishino . the free energy densities and thermal energy expectation values at the chain centers",
    "have been successfully calculated for the classical ising chain and the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath67 heisenberg chain by the quantum corner - transfer matrix dmrg .",
    "reliable results were given for finite temperatures and system sizes . yet , the algorithm faces two difficulties :      if finite - temperature data in the thermodynamic limit are aimed at , the quantum tmrg method is certainly still the method of choice .",
    "at least one of the mentioned problems should be solved to make the qctmrg technique an attractive option ."
