    "neutron stars are believed to form as stellar remnants of core - collapse supernovae , which occur at the end of massive star evolution .",
    "the density of matter inside a neutron star can easily become higher than normal nuclear density , a situation hard to realize in the laboratory .",
    "due to such high densities and resulting strong coupling nature , the equation of state ( eos ) for neutron star matter remains to be fixed .",
    "consequently , neutron stars act as a unique laboratory to constrain the properties of such dense matter .",
    "in fact , the discovery of a neutron star with @xmath6 can rule out some of soft eoss @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested that information about neutron star interiors can be obtained via neutron star asteroseismology or via possible detection of the spectra of gravitational waves emitted from neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . unlike gravitational waves ,",
    "there are some observational evidences for neutron star oscillations , namely , quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) in giant flares from soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "since sgrs are considered to be magnetars , which are neutron stars with strong surface magnetic fields of order @xmath7-@xmath8 g , the observed qpos could be strongly associated with neutron star oscillations .",
    "so far , three giant flares have been detected from sgr 0526@xmath566 , sgr 1900 + 14 , and sgr 1806@xmath520 , respectively .",
    "the timing analysis of the x - ray afterglow of the giant flares shows that in two of them , specific oscillation frequencies arose in the range from tens of hertz up to a few kilohertz @xcite .    after this discovery",
    ", many theoretical attempts to explain the observations have been made in terms of shear torsional oscillations in the crust of a neutron star and/or magnetic oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the important conclusion obtained from such attempts is that either the torsional oscillations or magnetic oscillations dominate the excited oscillations near the surface of a magnetized neutron star , depending on the magnetic field strength @xcite and magnetic configuration @xcite . given the magnetic field strength inferred from the spindown observations @xcite , we can reasonably consider the qpos observed in giant flares as crustal torsional oscillations , especially in the case of low - lying modes @xcite .",
    "this identification would allow one to probe the properties of matter in the crust , which are in turn related to the poorly known density dependence of the symmetry energy of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "once the density dependence of the symmetry energy is fixed , furthermore , one can address the thickness of the region where nuclei of nonuniform pastalike structures @xcite occur in a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the deeper inside a neutron star , the more uncertainties in the eos of neutron star matter . between an ionic ocean near the star s surface and a fluid core , a crust occurs . in most of the crust ,",
    "nuclei are believed to form a bcc coulomb lattice in a roughly uniform electron sea . when the density becomes higher than about @xmath9 g @xmath10",
    ", neutrons start to drip out of the nuclei , and some of them are expected to behave as a superfluid as long as the temperature is below the critical temperature .",
    "in fact , such superfluidity plays an important role in modeling pulsar glitches @xcite , while most of observed neutron stars are considered to be so cool that most of the dripped neutrons would behave as a superfluid in the absence of the lattice . according to the recent band calculations by @xcite",
    ", however , a significant fraction of the dripped neutrons can be entrained non - dissipatively by protons in the nuclei via bragg scattering off the lattice even at zero temperature .",
    "meanwhile , neutron superfluidity due to the remaining dripped neutrons affects the crustal torsional oscillations , because such oscillations would be controlled by the enthalpy density of the constituents that comove with the protons @xcite .",
    "there are earlier publications that examine the influence of neutron superfluidity on the torsional oscillations in the crust for a specific crust eos in the newtonian framework @xcite , while we have recently performed systematic calculations in the relativistic framework , which were presented only briefly @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we thus present full details of such calculations , which give possible constraints on the parameter @xmath0 characterizing the density dependence of the symmetry energy by comparing the fundamental frequencies of the shear torsional oscillations with the qpo frequencies observed in sgrs .",
    "we remark that @xcite performed a similar systematic analysis independently .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the crust eoss and equilibrium configurations that will be used for calculations of the crustal oscillation frequencies . in the third section",
    ", we give the perturbation equation that governs the shear torsional oscillations , as well as the boundary conditions , and then address how to take into account the effect of neutron superfluidity . in the fourth section , we show the numerical results for the oscillation frequencies and possible constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the paper closes with a conclusion .",
    "we adopt units of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "we begin with the properties of matter in neutron star crusts , which are to some degree constrained by empirical data for nuclear masses and radii . near the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature , the bulk energy per nucleon can be written as a function of baryon number density @xmath14 and neutron excess @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16\\alpha^2 , \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denote the saturation energy , saturation density , and incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath20 and @xmath0 are the parameters associated with the symmetry energy coefficients @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath24 . among these five parameters , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20",
    "are fairly well constrained by empirical masses and radii of stable nuclei , while the remaining two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath19 are left uncertain @xcite . to see how strongly the parameters are constrained ,",
    "two of us ( k.o and k.i ) first constructed the model for the bulk energy @xmath25 of nuclear matter as a function of neutron and proton number densities , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in such a way as to reproduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) in the limit of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "finally , for given @xmath43 and @xmath19 , the most relevant values of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath44 were obtained by fitting the charge number , mass excess , and charge radius , which can be calculated from the optimal density distribution , to the empirical values for stable nuclei .",
    "we remark that the parameter @xmath45 corresponds to the slope of the saturation line in the vicinity of @xmath46 @xcite .    in order to obtain the equilibrium nuclear shape and size as well as the crust eos for various sets of @xmath45 and @xmath19 at zero temperature , as in @xcite , @xcite generalized eqs .",

    ", we here confine ourselves to the parameter range @xmath50 mev , 180 mev @xmath51 360 mev , and @xmath52 mev @xmath53 , which equally well reproduce the mass and radius data for stable nuclei and effectively cover even extreme cases @xcite .",
    "the eos parameter sets adopted in the present analysis are tabulated in table [ tab : eos ] , where the baryon number densities @xmath54 at which the nuclear shape changes from sphere to cylinder and @xmath55 at which the nuclear matter becomes uniform are also listed .",
    "the interval between @xmath54 and @xmath55 corresponds to the pasta region , which decreases with @xmath0 and vanishes at @xmath56 mev @xcite .",
    "we remark that , in order to fill gaps in the values of @xmath0 , which appear in table i in @xcite , we add two more parameter sets , namely , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where the corresponding values of @xmath0 are 97.5 and 54.9 mev .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the fundamental frequencies of shear torsional oscillations in neutron star crusts , which contain superfluid neutrons , for nine sets of the star s mass and radius as well as eleven models of the crust eos , and considered possible relevance of the crustal shear modes to the qpos observed from only a few sgrs in the afterglow of giant flares .",
    "we have succeeded in identifying the low - lying qpos as the shear modes of different @xmath59 in two ways ( one of which has an obvious caveat ) , leading to two separate allowed regions of the eos parameter @xmath0 characterizing the density dependence of the symmetry energy via reasonable fitting of the calculated mode frequencies to the observed qpo frequencies .",
    "the present results are basically the same as those obtained in our earlier publications @xcite , but the present work is more systematic and quantitatively finer .",
    "we hope that future work in this direction , together with other empirical constraints on @xmath0 , will eventually reduce the two allowed regions to one .    in order to obtain a better constraint on @xmath0 asteroseismologically ,",
    "however , many questions remain . among various properties of crustal matter that control the shear torsional oscillations , the shear modulus and",
    "the superfluid density play an especially significant role .",
    "estimates of the shear modulus in the coulomb crystals of electron - screened , finite - size charges and in the liquid - crystalline pasta phases are thus desired , as well as of the local superfluid density throughout a wigner - seitz cell . for the bcc lattice of point charges , for example , the electron screening acts to reduce the shear modulus @xcite , leading to decrease in the eigenfrequencies of the shear torsional oscillations typically by 5 % . meanwhile ,",
    "shell and pairing effects on the nuclear charge , which are ignored in the present work , are expected to have some consequence to the shear modulus @xcite .",
    "additionally , the crustal oscillations must be coupled with core magnetic oscillations if one considers a magnetized neutron star .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that the frequencies of the crustal torsional oscillations can effectively increase , depending on the magnetic field strength and structure ( dipole - like poloidal , mixed toroidal - poloidal with a dipole - like poloidal component and a toroidal field confined to the region of field lines closing inside the star , and for poloidal fields with an additional quadrupole - like component ) . on the other hand",
    ", it remains to be solved how to deal with the junction conditions at the interface between the crust and core regions , at least when one takes into account the effect of superfluidity inside both core and crust regions .",
    "anyway we should also take into account the magnetic effect to obtain a better constraint on @xmath0 , which will be addressed elsewhere .",
