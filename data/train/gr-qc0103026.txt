    "the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics apply to equilibrium situations and small departures therefrom . in standard formulations of these laws , black holes in equilibrium",
    "are represented by stationary space - times with regular event horizons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while this idealization is a natural starting point , from a physical perspective it seems quite restrictive .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed discussion . ) to overcome this limitation , a new model for a black hole in equilibrium was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the generalization is two - fold .",
    "first , one replaces the notion of an event horizon with that of an isolated horizon .",
    "while the former are defined only retroactively using the fully evolved space - time geometry , the latter are defined quasi - locally by suitably constraining the geometry of the horizon surface itself .",
    "second , one drops the requirement that the space - time be stationary and asks only that the horizon be isolated .",
    "that is , the requirement that the black hole be in equilibrium is incorporated by demanding only that no matter or radiation fall through the horizon although the exterior space - time region may well admit radiation .",
    "consequently , the generalization in the class of allowed space - times is enormous . in particular , space - times admitting isolated horizons need not possess _ any _ killing vector field ; although event horizons of stationary black holes are isolated horizons , they are a very special case . a recent series of papers @xcite has generalized the laws of black hole mechanics to this broader context .",
    "the notion of isolated horizons has proved to be useful also in other contexts ranging from numerical relativity to background independent quantum gravity : i ) it plays a key role in an ongoing program for extracting physics from numerical simulations of black hole mergers @xcite ; ii ) it has led to the introduction @xcite of a physical model of hairy black holes , systematizing a large body of results on properties of these black holes which has accumulated from a mixture of analytical and numerical investigations ; and , iii ) it serves as a point of departure for statistical mechanical entropy calculations in which all non - rotating black holes ( extremal or not ) _ and _ cosmological horizons are incorporated in a single stroke @xcite .    the first treatment of black hole mechanics using isolated horizons @xcite only considered undistorted , non - rotating horizons .",
    "that is , the boundary conditions it used imply the _ intrinsic _ geometry of the horizon is spherically symmetric and the imaginary part of the weyl curvature component @xmath0which encodes gravitational angular momentum  vanishes at the horizon .",
    "although they do not constrain fields in the exterior region in any way ( even close to the horizon ) , these restrictions are , nonetheless , very strong .",
    "more recently , these boundary conditions were significantly weakened to allow for both distortion and rotation and the basic , geometric consequences of the more general boundary conditions were analyzed @xcite .",
    "the zeroth law of black hole mechanics was also extended to the more general context , and the first law , to non - rotating but possibly distorted isolated horizons .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the first law to the rotating case .",
    "we will first introduce ( quasi - local ) definitions of angular momentum and mass of the isolated horizon in this context and then establish the first law .",
    "thus , this paper is a continuation of @xcite and completes the task of deriving the black hole mechanics of all isolated horizons of direct physical interest .",
    "let us outline the key new points which distinguish the rotating case considered here .",
    "first , if the ( gravitational contribution to the ) horizon angular momentum is to be non - zero , the weyl component @xmath1 can not vanish on the horizon .",
    "therefore , we will extend the hamiltonian framework of @xcite by lifting the restriction on @xmath1 .",
    "second , by analogy with killing horizons , in the non - rotating case it was natural to require the time - evolution vector field to lie along the null normal to the horizon . in the general rotating case , by contrast",
    ", we expect the natural `` time - translation - like '' vector field to be space - like on the horizon , with components both along the null generators _ and _ along a transverse `` rotational '' direction .",
    "our evolution field will have this feature .",
    "third , to have a well - defined notion of angular momentum , one expects there should exist a rotational symmetry on the horizon .",
    "we will analyze symmetries of all isolated horizons and show that the boundary conditions imply that there are three universal classes , characterized by the structure of the symmetry group : i ) spherically symmetric horizons ; ii ) axi - symmetric horizons ; and , iii ) general , distorted horizons ( with no symmetry other than that along the null generators ) . to have a well - defined notion of angular momentum",
    ", we will focus on class ii .",
    "( class i was discussed in @xcite while the focus of @xcite was on _ non - rotating _",
    "isolated horizons in class iii . )    in spite of these differences , the basic techniques used in this paper are very similar to those of @xcite . the hamiltonian formalism is again employed to motivate the definition of horizon mass and , in our rotating case , also angular momentum .",
    "the first law again emerges as a necessary and sufficient condition for the evolution to be hamiltonian , but now acquires new terms resulting from the angular momentum of the horizon .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] briefly recalls the definition and basic structure of isolated horizons as discussed in @xcite . section [ s3 ] analyzes the possible symmetries of isolated horizons .",
    "section [ s4 ] proves the first law of black hole mechanics for space - times containing rotating isolated horizons .",
    "section [ s5 ] summarizes the results and the appendix discusses the issue of defining hamiltonians generating diffeomorphisms which need not be horizon symmetries .",
    "this section summarizes the basic properties of isolated horizons and introduces the notation used in this paper .",
    "specifically , subsection [ s2.1 ] recalls from @xcite the definition of a _ weakly isolated horizon _ in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory and several of its immediate consequences .",
    "subsection [ s2.2 ] analyzes certain geometric structures on the horizon .",
    "this discussion is essential to the classification of horizon symmetries presented in section [ s3 ] and has not appeared before .",
    "finally , subsection [ s2.3 ] reviews the covariant phase space of space - times admitting weakly isolated horizons as inner boundaries , constructed in @xcite .",
    "let us begin fixing a few conventions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume all manifolds and fields are smooth and restrict ourselves to the einstein  maxwell theory .",
    "space - time @xmath2 is a 4-dimensional manifold equipped with a metric @xmath3 of signature @xmath4 and a maxwell potential @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is a null hypersurface in @xmath7 , its _ future - directed _ null normal direction will be denoted @xmath8 .",
    "this direction field is naturally an equivalence class of vector fields on @xmath6 under rescaling by arbitrary positive functions .",
    "we refer to it simply as the _",
    "null normal _ to @xmath6 .",
    "pull - backs to @xmath6 of the covariant tensor fields on @xmath2 ( or more generally , covariant indices of arbitrary tensor fields ) will be denoted by an under - arrow and equalities restricted to @xmath6 , by the symbol @xmath9 .",
    "the ( degenerate ) intrinsic geometry on @xmath6 is described by the metric @xmath10 .",
    "a tensor @xmath11 on @xmath6 will be said to be an `` inverse '' of @xmath12 if it satisfies @xmath13 .",
    "because of the degeneracy of the intrinsic geometry on @xmath6 , the inverse metric is not unique , but can be changed freely by the addition of a term of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 tangent to @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "the expansion @xmath17 of the null normal field @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the torsion - free connection on @xmath2 defined by @xmath3 .",
    "it is straightforward to check this definition is independent of the choice of inverse metric , but does depend upon the choice of null normal vector .",
    "a _ weakly isolated horizon _ consists of a pair @xmath21)$ ] , where @xmath6 is a 3-dimensional sub - manifold of @xmath2 and @xmath22 $ ] is an equivalence class of vector fields on @xmath6 under _ constant _ rescalings , such that    1 .",
    "[ bcnul ] @xmath6 is topologically @xmath23 and null , @xmath22 $ ] lies along its null normal and the space of its integral curves is diffeomorphic to @xmath24 ; 2 .",
    "[ bcexp ] the expansion @xmath17 of @xmath6 vanishes for any choice @xmath25 $ ] of the null normal ; 3 .",
    "[ bccon ] the space - time connection has a ( partial ) symmetry along @xmath22 $ ] in the sense that @xmath26 \\ell^b \\eqhat 0\\ ] ] for any choice of @xmath25 $ ] ; 4 .",
    "[ bceom ] all equations of motion hold _ at _ @xmath6 ; and , 5 .",
    "[ bcmax ] the maxwell potential @xmath27 is _ gauge - adapted _ to the horizon in the sense that @xmath28 for any choice of @xmath25 $ ] .    a killing horizon ( with topology @xmath23 ) in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory is automatically a weakly isolated horizon under this definition , provided the maxwell field strength is symmetric along the killing field and the gauge of its potential is chosen to satisfy .",
    "if the killing field is defined only in a neighborhood of the horizon , there is no obvious way to fix the freedom of rescaling it by a constant .",
    "this freedom is reflected in our freedom to rescale @xmath29 by a constant .",
    "note , however , the definition admits a much broader class of examples . to explore this class ,",
    "let us begin by examining the motivations behind the conditions themselves .",
    "some of the restrictions made by the above conditions are relatively tame .",
    "for example , the topological requirement in condition ( [ bcnul ] ) simply restricts the horizon to have the topology which one expects to arise from gravitational collapse .",
    "this restriction can be weakened to allow for more general topologies @xcite , though we shall not discuss this possibility further here .",
    "more importantly , the remainder of condition ( [ bcnul ] ) makes clear the roles of @xmath6 and @xmath22 $ ] : @xmath6 is the horizon surface and @xmath22 $ ] is a distinguished class of its null normals .",
    "condition ( [ bceom ] ) is also straightforward ; it applies a dynamical restriction closely analogous to the one usually imposed at infinity . however , while the metric at infinity is required to approach a _ specific _",
    "asymptotic solution to the einstein equations , condition ( [ bceom ] ) allows the metric to approach _ any _ solution to the einstein equations at the horizon",
    ".    conditions ( [ bcnul ] ) and ( [ bceom ] ) are satisfied on a wide variety of surfaces , including many even in minkowski space - time .",
    "however , the vast majority of these surfaces do not have the characteristics one would intuitively expect on a `` horizon . ''",
    "the first key condition which distinguishes a weakly isolated horizon is ( [ bcexp ] ) .",
    "it implies the cross - sectional area of @xmath6 is _ constant _ `` in time , '' thereby capturing the notion of isolation without introducing a killing field .",
    "the horizon area is denoted @xmath30 and we define its radius @xmath31 by @xmath32 this condition makes the definition dramatically stronger . for example , it implies there are in fact no weakly isolated horizons in minkowski space - time .    to discuss condition ( [ bccon ] )",
    ", it will be useful to first explore some consequences of condition ( [ bcexp ] ) by itself .",
    "first , since @xmath25 $ ] is normal to @xmath6 , it is automatically twist - free and geodetic : @xmath33 motivated by the usual definition for killing horizons , the acceleration @xmath34 of @xmath35 will be called the _ surface gravity of _ @xmath6 _ with respect to the normal _ @xmath35 . as one can see from , when @xmath35 is rescaled within @xmath22 $ ] , the surface gravity scales by the same factor .",
    "thus , the surface gravity of a weakly isolated horizon is generally defined only up to a positive constant multiplicative factor .",
    "second , given the vanishing twist and expansion of @xmath35 , one can use the raychaudhuri equation for the null congruence generated by @xmath35 to conclude its _ shear _ must also vanish , and that @xmath36 third , the vanishing twist , shear and expansion of @xmath35 imply the existence of a 1-form @xmath37 , intrinsic to @xmath6 , satisfying @xmath38 this 1-form @xmath37 is independent of the choice of @xmath39 $ ] and its contraction with @xmath35 will yield the surface gravity @xmath34 defined above . furthermore , as we will now discuss , condition ( [ bccon ] ) causes @xmath37 to play a central role in the theory of weakly isolated horizons .",
    "one important consequence of is that @xmath35 is a symmetry of the degenerate intrinsic geometry of @xmath6 in the sense that @xmath40 in the case of a non - null hypersurface in space - time on which the intrinsic geometry is non - degenerate , the existence of a killing vector for the intrinsic metric would automatically imply the intrinsic connection was likewise preserved along that killing vector . in other words , for a non - degenerate intrinsic geometry , the restriction of condition ( [ bccon ] ) would _ follow _ from .",
    "however , this is not the case for a null hypersurface since the intrinsic metric does not determine the intrinsic connection uniquely .",
    "thus , condition ( [ bccon ] ) must be imposed separately .",
    "the logic of making this restriction , however , is clear : we are extending the symmetry of the degenerate metric to the intrinsic connection on @xmath6 given by @xmath41 .",
    "note , however , that condition ( [ bccon ] ) does not restrict the _",
    "connection on @xmath6 , but only its action on @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , given the definition , condition ( [ bccon ] ) can be written simply as @xmath43 this formula is much easier to apply in practice than , which is why the 1-form @xmath44 plays an important role in our formulation .",
    "( if one requires that @xmath35 be a symmetry of the full pull - back of the connection to @xmath6 , we obtain isolated horizons @xcite . while this stronger condition is physically reasonable ,",
    "it is significantly more difficult to check its validity in examples .",
    "since the stronger condition is not needed in our proof of the zeroth and the first laws , we have chosen to work with weakly isolated horizons . )    finally , let us examine condition ( [ bcmax ] ) on the maxwell field . at first , the symmetry requirement on the maxwell field appears similar to the restriction placed on the horizon geometry by condition ( [ bccon ] )",
    ". however , the two are actually quite different .",
    "while represents a genuine restriction on the physical fields at the horizon , can always be achieved via a gauge transformation when the other conditions are satisfied .",
    "using the einstein equations at the horizon and the consequence of the raychaudhuri equation one can show the 1-form @xmath45 is null at the horizon .",
    "since this 1-form is also orthogonal to @xmath42 , it must be proportional to @xmath46 , whence represents the contraction of a vector field on the first index of a differential form . ] @xmath47 then , using the cartan formula for the lie derivative and the maxwell equations at the horizon , one finds @xmath48 thus , because the field strength is already compatible with the symmetry imposed on the maxwell potential by condition ( [ bcmax ] ) , is indeed merely a ( partial ) choice of gauge .",
    "we conclude this subsection with several remarks .",
    "each of these points is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "first , while this paper explicitly examines only those weakly isolated horizons which occur in einstein  maxwell theory , it is not difficult to generalize the definition given here to allow other matter fields near the horizon .",
    "however , it is not possible to incorporate arbitrary types of matter , but only those which satisfy a certain energy condition .",
    "specifically , the stress - energy tensor of each matter field present at the horizon must have the property that @xmath49 is future directed and causal for any @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "this condition follows immediately from the dominant energy condition which is usually assumed in proofs of the laws of black hole mechanics .",
    "moreover , since the maxwell ( or yang - mills , etc . )",
    "field satisfies the dominant energy condition , it will automatically meet the ( weaker ) demand made here .",
    "this condition is essential to the derivation of from the raychaudhuri equation and to the associated proof that the horizon is shear - free .",
    "second , the conditions given above imply the _ space - time _ geometry at a weakly isolated horizon is algebraically special .",
    "this is an interesting feature which carries over from the stationary context where the kerr ",
    "newman black hole space - times are ( globally ) of petrov type ii - ii .",
    "however , there are several important differences .",
    "one can show @xmath22 $ ] is a repeated principal null direction _ at the horizon _",
    ", whence the space - time geometry is necessarily of petrov type ii there . however , it is not generally possible to identify a second repeated principal null direction at such a horizon , so the geometry need nt be of type ii - ii .",
    "moreover , the space - time geometry _ away _ from the horizon may not be algebraically special at all ; our conditions constrain only the local , horizon geometry . since @xmath22 $ ] is a repeated principal null direction for the space - time metric at the horizon , the newman ",
    "penrose curvature components satisfy @xmath51 in any null frame which includes an element @xmath25 $ ] at @xmath6 .",
    "it then follows that the newman  penrose component @xmath0 is `` gauge - invariant '' ( i.e. , independent of the other three null tetrad elements ) at @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the imaginary part of @xmath0 can be expressed without reference to any null tetrad using the 1-form @xmath44 introduced in : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the natural area 2-form on @xmath6 ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "third , the conditions enable a simple proof of the zeroth law of black hole mechanics for generic weakly isolated horizons .",
    "examining the definition of surface gravity for a weakly isolated horizon and the definition of @xmath44 , one finds @xmath54 whence ( by the cartan formula ) we have @xmath55 the first term on the right hand side vanishes because of , while the second vanishes because @xmath56 is given by and the contraction of @xmath53 with @xmath22 $ ] vanishes .",
    "thus , the surface gravity of a weakly isolated horizon is indeed constant ; the zeroth law holds .",
    "note , however , that because @xmath6 is equipped only with an _ equivalence class _ @xmath22 $ ] of null normals , we have the constant rescaling freedom @xmath57 under which the surface gravity transforms via @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , while surface gravity is constant on an isolated horizon , we can not assign a particular value to it .",
    "this is not surprising : one can not assign a specific numerical value to surface gravity even on a _ locally _ defined killing horizon , since the killing field is defined only up to rescaling by a constant .",
    "finally , we note the argument establishing the zeroth law for weakly isolated horizons can also be applied to the maxwell field . repeating this argument , with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath27 , and applying and one finds the quantity @xmath60 is also constant over the horizon surface .",
    "motivated by this fact , we define the _ electric potential _ of the horizon by @xmath61 once again , while the electric potential is always constant over @xmath6 , its value is not fixed .",
    "we will first discuss the relation between certain types of fields on @xmath62 and fields on the 2-sphere @xmath63 of integral curves of @xmath22 $ ] and then show that if @xmath34 is non - zero , @xmath6 admits a natural foliation .",
    "this discussion will be useful especially in section [ s3 ] for our analysis of the symmetry algebras of weakly isolated horizons .",
    "denote by @xmath64 the natural projection map @xmath64 from @xmath6 to @xmath63 .",
    "a vector field @xmath65 defined intrinsically on @xmath6 can be unambiguously projected to a vector field @xmath66 on @xmath63 if and only if @xmath67 is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , a covariant tensor field @xmath68 on @xmath6 is a pull - back under @xmath64 of a tensor field @xmath69 on @xmath63 if and only if two conditions hold : i ) @xmath70 is transversal to @xmath29 in the sense that the contraction of any of its indices with @xmath29 vanishes ; and , ii ) the lie derivative @xmath71 vanishes .",
    "these are rather general properties of manifolds ruled by one - dimensional curves .    applying them to the case of a weakly isolated horizon ,",
    "we conclude that the degenerate metric @xmath12 is the pull - back to @xmath6 of a riemannian metric @xmath72 on @xmath63 .",
    "the connection 1-form @xmath44 does satisfy condition ii ) above .",
    "however , since @xmath73 it defines a 1-form @xmath74 on @xmath63 _ only _ in the extremal case , i.e. , only when @xmath75 . finally , the projection map @xmath64 enables us to define a preferred area element @xmath53 on @xmath6 . using the riemannian metric @xmath76 , one can construct the area element @xmath77 on @xmath63 and pull that 2-form back to @xmath6 under @xmath64 . by construction , the resulting 2-form @xmath53 on @xmath6 satisfies @xmath78 the first of these results",
    "was already used in the proof of the zeroth law in the last subsection .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath34 is non - zero and discuss the preferred foliation of @xmath62 ( for further details and a discussion of global subtleties , see @xcite ) . for simplicity",
    ", consider first the `` non - rotating case '' where @xmath79 . according to",
    ", this is precisely the case where the connection form @xmath44 is curl - free .",
    "hence @xmath80 for some function @xmath81 on @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath82 is a non - zero constant on @xmath6 , whence @xmath22 $ ] is transverse to the @xmath83 surfaces .",
    "thus , @xmath84 surfaces define a natural foliation of @xmath6 by a family of 2-spheres .    to conclude ,",
    "let us consider the rotating case . while @xmath1 no longer vanishes in this case",
    ", it is still constant along each generator of @xmath6 , i.e. , is a pull - back of a function @xmath85 on @xmath63 . using ( [ dhc ] ) as the motivation ,",
    "let us introduce a 1-form @xmath86 on @xmath63 such that @xmath87 .",
    "of course , this potential @xmath86 is not unique ; one is free to add to it the gradient of any function on @xmath63 .",
    "there is , however , a natural gauge condition which fixes this ambiguity : since there are no harmonic 1-forms on the 2-sphere @xmath63 , there exists a unique 1-form @xmath88 such that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the area element on @xmath63 and @xmath91 denotes the hodge dual on @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath92 be the pull - back to @xmath6 of @xmath93 and set @xmath94 then , @xmath95 and @xmath96 on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , @xmath97 has the same properties that @xmath44 had in the non - rotating case .",
    "therefore , it defines a foliation of @xmath6 by a family of 2-spheres .",
    "our gauge choice is natural in the sense that it is the only choice for which this more general construction , when applied to the non - rotating case , reproduces the natural foliation obtained above .",
    "( indeed , in the non - rotating case and in our gauge , @xmath88 vanishes on @xmath63 and @xmath98 on @xmath6 . )",
    "while this foliation is used only to elucidate certain points in this paper , it plays a key role in the analysis of the near - horizon , strong field geometry @xcite and in extracting physics from space - times obtained via numerical simulations , such as those associated with black hole mergers @xcite .      in the spirit of @xcite",

    ", one discovers the integral over @xmath2 reduces to surface terms at @xmath107 and at @xmath6 ( the surface term at @xmath105 vanishes because of the asymptotic fall - off conditions ) . in order to reduce the expression for the second variation further ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce a pair of scalar functions on @xmath6 which act as `` potentials '' for the surface gravity and electric potential . given any point @xmath129 in phase space , the scalar field @xmath130 is defined by @xmath131 and the scalar field @xmath132 by @xmath133 note that both of these functions are _ completely determined by the physical fields_.

    "the situation is similar at the internal boundary @xmath6 .",
    "infinitesimal diffeomorphisms and internal lorentz rotations need not be in the kernel of the symplectic structure unless they vanish on @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , we will show in section [ s4 ] that space - time motions corresponding to time translations and rotations are generated by non - trivial hamiltonians with surface terms both at infinity _ and _ at the horizon .",
    "the horizon surface terms will then be interpreted as the horizon energy and angular momentum . however , since infinitesimal internal rotations ( and gauge transformations of the maxwell theory ) on @xmath6 are not automatically in the kernel of the symplectic structure , one must separately ensure that physical quantities such as energy and angular momentum are gauge invariant .",
    "in this section we analyze the possible symmetries of a weakly isolated horizon .",
    "because the generators @xmath22 $ ] of @xmath6 are not assumed to be complete , we will focus on _ infinitesimal _ symmetries .",
    "since the horizon is the inner boundary of space - times under consideration while spatial infinity is the outer , one would expect the horizon symmetries to be analogous to the asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity .",
    "thus , it is natural to define the horizon symmetry algebra @xmath139 to be the quotient of the lie algebra of all infinitesimal space - time diffeomorphisms which preserve the horizon structure by its sub - algebra consisting of elements which vanish on the horizon .",
    "the key question now is : what is the horizon structure relevant for these considerations ?",
    "it is here that one would expect a significant departure from the situation at spatial infinity . at infinity ,",
    "all metrics approach a fixed flat metric whence the relevant geometric structure and hence also the symmetry algebra is universal ; it does not vary from one space - time to another . at the horizon , by contrast , we are in the strong field regime and the near - horizon geometry can vary from one space - time to another .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the relevant horizon structure or the symmetry algebra @xmath139 to be universal . nonetheless ,",
    "because the horizon _ is _ a boundary and all geometries under consideration are subject to the same boundary conditions , one would expect the horizon symmetry algebra to fall in a small number of `` universality classes '' .",
    "we will see that this expectation is correct .    to identify the relevant horizon structure ,",

    "this is the symmetry lie algebra for the horizon in question",

    "let us note that , irrespective of the specific weakly isolated horizon under consideration , @xmath146 is at least one - dimensional : by setting @xmath147 for any @xmath148 $ ] , we see ( [ kinw ] ) and ( [ dynw ] ) are automatically satisfied by virtue of the very definition of weakly isolated horizons .",

    "setting @xmath161 in ( [ kinw ] ) we obtain : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a constant on @xmath6 .",
    "the first of the two conditions in ( [ dynw ] ) does not restrict @xmath151 in any way while the second implies : @xmath164 therefore , if @xmath165 , then @xmath151 must be constant on @xmath6 . in this case the only generator - preserving symmetries are given by @xmath166 $ ] and @xmath149 is 1-dimensional . on the other hand , if @xmath167 ( i.e. , @xmath168)$ ] is extremal ) , ( [ flhc ] ) imposes no condition on @xmath151",

    "we can now use our discussion of section [ s2.2 ] on the relation between fields on @xmath6 with those on the 2-sphere @xmath63 of its generators to analyze @xmath160 in terms of these projections @xmath169 .",
    "the first of eqs ( [ dynw ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath169 is a killing field on @xmath170 : @xmath171 denote by @xmath172 the isometry lie algebra of @xmath170 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath160 is a sub - algebra of @xmath172 .",

    "on the one hand , every killing field @xmath169 on @xmath63 is of the form @xmath174 for some function @xmath175 . on the other hand , since all metrics on a 2-sphere are conformal to one another , any killing field for",

    "now , in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) , _ all _ the orbits of the vector field converge to a same point of the sphere at which @xmath177 ( there are two such points in the case ( ii ) ) . since the function @xmath178 is constant on every orbit , it follows that in these cases it would be constant whence @xmath177 on the entire sphere .",

    "we will conclude with two remarks .",
    "\\1 . in the above discussion",
    ", we have focussed only on symmetries of the relevant horizon geometry . in the einstein  maxwell theory ,",
    "it is natural to require that an infinitesimal symmetry @xmath143 of a given weakly isolated horizon also satisfy @xmath192 .",
    "physically , this condition requires the symmetry to preserve the flux of the magnetic field through the horizon .",
    "it is natural to demand the same of the electric flux",
    ". therefore , we will also insist that @xmath193 at the horizon .",
    "neither of these additional conditions will affect the classification scheme described above in any way .",
    "\\2 . as shown in section [ s2.2 ] ,",
    "if @xmath194 , the weakly isolated horizon @xmath121)$ ] admits a canonical foliation by 2-spheres @xmath138 which can be used to lift vector fields on @xmath63 to `` horizontal '' vector fields on @xmath6 . in particular , then , there is a canonical injection of the projective symmetry algebra @xmath160 into the total symmetry algebra @xmath146 . as a result ,",
    "the semi - direct sum structure reduces simply to a direct sum structure . in this case , one can write _ any _ symmetry vector @xmath143 in the form @xmath195 where @xmath196 is a constant and @xmath197 is a _ horizontal _ vector field ( i.e. tangent to the preferred 2-spheres @xmath138 ) , satisfying @xmath198 .",
    "the condition @xmath199 further implies @xmath200 , and hence @xmath201 .",
    "in this section we will introduce definitions of mass and angular momentum for type ii weakly isolated horizons and derive the first law of black hole mechanics in this context .",
    "as in the non - rotating case treated in @xcite , we will use a hamiltonian framework .",
    "this section is divided into five parts . in the first , we make appropriate restrictions on the phase space to enable the introduction of a useful notion of angular momentum .",
    "the second sub - section considers the issue of defining hamiltonians generating canonical transformations corresponding to _ space - time _ diffeomorphisms and provides criteria for their existence . in the third sub - section",
    ", we specialize this discussion to the case where the diffeomorphism reduces to a rotational symmetry at the horizon and show the corresponding hamiltonian does indeed exist .",
    "this hamiltonian is interpreted as the horizon angular momentum .",
    "the fourth sub - section considers space - time diffeomorphisms which can be interpreted as time - translations and analyzes the issue of whether their induced action on the phase space is hamiltonian ( i.e. , preserves the symplectic structure ) .",
    "in contrast to the rotational case , the answer is not always in the affirmative : as in @xcite , the necessary and sufficient condition for the evolution to be hamiltonian is precisely that the first law holds .",
    "thus , for every space - time vector field @xmath202 which generates a hamiltonian evolution , there is an associated energy @xmath203 and angular momentum @xmath204 satisfying the first law .",
    "the last sub - section shows that , in the einstein ",
    "maxwell case , there is a natural way to select a preferred class of evolution vector fields @xmath205 for which @xmath206 can be interpreted as the _ horizon mass _ @xmath207 .",
    "the corresponding first law is then the canonical generalization of the standard first law of black hole mechanics to the context of rotating , weakly isolated horizons .",
    "physical observables such as energy and angular momentum are naturally associated with symmetries : energy is associated with time - translations and angular momentum with rigid rotations .",
    "for example , in the familiar construction of the adm energy , one first introduces a vector field @xmath202 in space - time which asymptotically approaches a time - translation symmetry of the fixed flat metric at infinity and constructs the hamiltonian @xmath208 generating the corresponding time - evolution in the phase space .",
    "since einstein s theory is generally covariant , `` on shell '' ( i.e. when the constraints are satisfied ) , the hamiltonian reduces to 2-surface integrals on the boundaries of the cauchy surface under consideration . under the standard assumption that there are no internal boundaries ,",
    "the on - shell value @xmath209 of the hamiltonian is thus given just by a 2-surface integral at infinity , which is interpreted as the total adm energy of space - time with respect to the asymptotic time - translation of @xmath202 .",
    "likewise , to define the total angular momentum of space - time , one considers a space - time vector field @xmath210 which approaches a rigid rotation of the asymptotic metric at infinity .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath211 is then the surface integral at infinity giving the on - shell value of the hamiltonian generating rotations along @xmath210 . to define energy and angular momentum of an isolated horizon , it is therefore natural to examine hamiltonians which generate appropriate symmetries at the horizon",
    ".    let us begin with angular momentum . in the above procedure",
    ", while there is considerable freedom in the choice of @xmath210 , these vector fields must approach a _ fixed _",
    "rotational killing field @xmath187 of the universal flat metric at infinity .",
    "this condition plays a key role in the standard proof of the existence of a hamiltonian generating the corresponding motions in phase space .",
    "more importantly , the requirement has a direct physical origin .",
    "angular momentum is _ not _ a scalar quantity in physical theories and has several independent components . by fixing one particular axial symmetry across all asymptotically flat space - times",
    ", one effectively guarantees the _",
    "same component _ of angular momentum is calculated for all space - times .",
    "if @xmath210 were to approach different rotational killing fields of the flat background in different space - times , even if one could construct the corresponding conserved quantity , it would be difficult to interpret it physically .    to define angular momentum of weakly isolated horizons",
    ", it would be natural to start with vector fields @xmath210 which approach a rotational symmetry on the horizon .",
    "recall however that , in contrast to infinity , weakly isolated horizons do _ not _ have a universal metric and , furthermore , the metrics in class iii isolated horizons need not admit _ any _ rotational symmetry at all .",
    "therefore , it is natural first to restrict ourselves to class ii , i.e. , axi - symmetric , weakly isolated horizons .",
    "note however that , even in this case , the metric on the horizon is not universal , whence a priori we do not have a fixed rotational vector field @xmath187 on @xmath6 that the space - time vector fields @xmath210 can be required to approach .",
    "therefore , for a meaningful comparison of horizon angular momenta of different space - times , it is convenient to introduce a",
    "_ fixed _ rotational vector field @xmath187 on the horizon and admit only those space - times in the phase space which have this @xmath187 as the horizon symmetry .",
    "we will do so .",
    "thus , let us now fix a vector field @xmath187 on the inner boundary @xmath6 of @xmath2 such that : ( i ) it has vanishing lie bracket with @xmath22 $ ] , ( ii ) vanishes on exactly two generators of @xmath6 , and ( iii ) has closed , circular orbits of affine length @xmath212 . for calculational convenience",
    ", we will also insist that it be tangent to the past boundary @xmath136 of the horizon .",
    "like the equivalence class @xmath22 $ ] , this @xmath187 will now be regarded as an extra structure fixed on @xmath6 once and for all .",
    "the phase space will now consist of the sub - manifold @xmath213 of the covariant phase space @xmath128 ( of section [ s2.3 ] ) , consisting of those asymptotically flat solutions @xmath112 to the field equations for which @xmath21 , \\phi^a)$ ] is a type ii horizon with @xmath187 as its rotational symmetry .",

    "this result will then be used to define the horizon angular momentum and energy in the next two sub - sections . in this sub - section",
    ", we will allow @xmath143 to vary from one space - time to another . since we fixed the rotational symmetry field @xmath187 on @xmath6 ,",
    "this generality is not necessary for the definition of angular momentum . however , as we will see in section [ s4.4 ] , it is essential to the definition of energy because , in contrast to spatial infinity , the near horizon geometry can vary from one space - time to another .",
    "this complication makes the question of existence for certain hamiltonians rather more subtle in the presence of a weakly isolated horizon .    for calculational simplicity , it is useful to introduce a universal foliation of the horizon by 2-spheres , although our final results do not depend on it .",
    "we saw in section [ s2.2 ] that a non - extremal , weakly isolated horizon admits a natural foliation of this type .",
    "but we would like to incorporate the extremal case as well .",
    "let us therefore define the leaves of the foliation as the rigid translations of the past boundary @xmath136 of @xmath6 along any element of the equivalence class @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "( in the non - extremal case , these are precisely the level surfaces of the function @xmath130 appearing in the symplectic structure and this foliation coincides with the preferred foliation if and only if the past boundary @xmath136 is a leaf of the preferred foliation . ) the practical advantage of introducing such a foliation is that it allows us to decompose a vector field @xmath143 on the horizon in to vertical and horizontal components , exactly as in .",
    "consider , then , a smooth assignment of a vector field @xmath143 on @xmath2 to each space - time in the phase space @xmath213 such that , at infinity , @xmath143 is an asymptotic symmetry , and on the horizon @xmath143 is tangential to @xmath6 , and @xmath219 with @xmath220 and @xmath196 a constant , if @xmath189 , @xmath196 need not be constant on @xmath6 for @xmath143 to define a symmetry of that horizon . however , our purpose here is to consider a _",

    "the motion in phase space associated to the diffeomorphism along @xmath143 is given simply by the lie derivative : @xmath221 when the background fields @xmath222 satisfy the field equations of einstein - maxwell theory , one can easily verify that @xmath218 satisfies the linearized equations of motion .",
    "it therefore represents a tangent vector field on covariant phase space .",
    "this vector field generates a canonical transformation if it preserves the symplectic structure , i.e. , if @xmath223 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath218 is a canonical transformation if and only if there exists a hamiltonian function @xmath224 on phase space such that @xmath225 for all tangent vectors @xmath226 to phase space .",

    "the integrals on @xmath228 are the usual ones and are not the main focus of this subsection .",
    "on the other hand , the surface terms at @xmath138 arising from the bulk integrals , together with those already present in , will provide the critical test of whether @xmath218 defines a symmetry of the symplectic structure ; we will focus on these .",
    "the first issue one must address is the definition of @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "since @xmath130 and @xmath132 are uniquely determined by the triplet @xmath112 at the horizon ( see and ) , @xmath231 and @xmath232 are completely unambiguous .",
    "however , their explicit expressions involve a subtlety . for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider @xmath233 .",
    "one may first be tempted to set @xmath234 . however , recall the definition of @xmath130 required @xmath130 to vanish on @xmath136 .",
    "the naive definition of @xmath233 generally does not preserve this condition .",
    "hence the naive expression is incorrect and must be modified to ensure that @xmath233 vanishes on @xmath136 . to address this problem ,",
    "let us proceed systematically and return to definition of @xmath130 . using the second part to the definition of @xmath130 and the properties @xmath235 and @xmath236 of @xmath237",
    ", it follows that @xmath238 since @xmath233 must vanish on @xmath136 , we conclude @xmath239 on all of @xmath6 .",
    "a similar argument applies to @xmath132 , whence we conclude @xmath240 note that the subtlety arose because @xmath130 and @xmath132 are _ potentials _ for physical fields .",
    "since all other terms in involve the fields themselves , there is no further subtlety in defining the action of @xmath218 ; the action is given simply by the lie derivative .",
    "the remainder of the calculation is straightforward .",
    "the surface terms in arising from the bulk integrals can be expressed in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath53 .",
    "the final result can be conveniently expressed as @xmath241 - ( \\delta h_w \\vins \\hc ) \\te",

    "the right side of this result consists of integrals both at the horizon and at infinity .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath224 is to exist , then the right side of must be equal to the exact variation of some expression .",
    "as is well - known , the surface integrals at infinity can themselves be written as exact variations whenever @xmath143 becomes a symmetry of the asymptotic metric at infinity .",
    "however , there is no a priori reason why the surface integral at the horizon is an exact variation .",
    "thus , somewhat surprisingly , although the evolution generated by @xmath143 does yield a flow on the phase space @xmath213 , _ this flow need not be hamiltonian_. the necessary and sufficient condition for it to be hamiltonian is precisely that the surface integral on @xmath138 in ( [ dgen1 ] ) equals @xmath243 for some function @xmath244 on @xmath213 ( depending only on values of horizon fields ) .      to define angular momentum , let us assign a vector field @xmath210 on @xmath2 to each space - time in @xmath213 such that its restriction to @xmath6 is given by our fixed rotational vector field @xmath187 .",
    "since we are primarily interested only in the horizon angular momentum , to avoid the unnecessary analysis of the terms at infinity , let us further require that @xmath210 vanishes outside some compact neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "( we will relax this requirement after obtaining the expression of the horizon angular momentum . ) then , setting @xmath245 , simplifies : the term at infinity vanishes and @xmath246 can be set to zero .",

    "therefore , we conclude the hamiltonian generating motions along @xmath210 does indeed exist . moreover , that hamiltonian will consist of a single surface term at @xmath6 whose value may be taken to define the angular momentum @xmath217 of the horizon : @xmath248 where the integral can be evaluated on _ any _ cross - section of @xmath6 .",
    "this definition is manifestly ( quasi-)local to the horizon .",
    "since @xmath44 and @xmath53 are invariant under the permissible tetrad rotations , the gravitational term is invariant under internal lorentz rotations at the horizon .",
    "using the fact that @xmath249 and the maxwell equations , it is easy to check that the maxwell term is also gauge invariant . finally , note that , in contrast to the standard angular momentum expressions at infinity @xcite , the horizon angular momentum @xmath217 includes contributions from both the gravitational and electro - magnetic fields . in this respect the right side of is completely analogous to the expression of the horizon energy derived in @xcite in the non - rotating case .",
    "it is natural to ask if the horizon angular momentum can be expressed directly in terms of space - time curvature at @xmath6 .",
    "the intuition derived from the newman - penrose framework suggests that the gravitational contribution to the angular momentum is encoded in the component @xmath1 of the weyl curvature .",
    "we will now show that his rule of thumb is explicitly realized in the present construction . since @xmath187 is a killing vector of the intrinsic horizon geometry ,",
    "it is also a symmetry of the area element @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath250 , from which it follows that @xmath251 for some smooth function @xmath151 satisfying @xmath252 on the horizon . now , since @xmath187 is tangent to @xmath138 , we have @xmath253 where we have performed an integration by parts in the last step .",
    "next , consider the electromagnetic term in . since @xmath254 and @xmath255 , it follows that @xmath256 for some smooth function @xmath257 satisfying @xmath258 on the horizon . hence , using an identical argument as above we can replace the term @xmath259 involving the electromagnetic potential by the newman - penrose component @xmath260 of the maxwell field ( given by @xmath261 $ ] ) .",
    "thus , we can re - express the horizon angular momentum as @xmath262 since the integrands in are lie - dragged by @xmath29 , the full expression can be projected to the 2-sphere @xmath263 of generators of @xmath6 .",
    "having the precise definition at hand , we can now ask for its relation with other notions of angular momentum available in the literature .",
    "first suppose that there is no maxwell ( or any other field ) in a neighborhood of @xmath6 and @xmath210 is in fact a killing field of a specific geometry in our phase - space @xmath213 in this neighborhood .",
    "then , one could also define the angular momentum via komar integral . to analyze the relation between the two definitions ,",
    "first consider the 1-form @xmath264 on @xmath6 which is normal to the foliation by @xmath138 and is normalized with @xmath265 everywhere .",
    "it is easy to show @xmath266 , where @xmath20 denotes the space - time connection . using this relation in the gravitational contribution to the angular momentum definition",
    ", one finds @xmath267 where we have used the killing property of @xmath210 in the last equality . by re - writing the last integral in terms of the the space - time dual of the 2-form @xmath268 , we obtain @xmath269 the right side is precisely the komar angular momentum .",
    "thus , in any space - time in which @xmath187 can be extended to a space - time killing field @xmath210 in a neighborhood of @xmath6 , the gravitational contribution to @xmath204 agrees with the usual komar expression defined by @xmath210 . as at infinity",
    ", this is an exact agreement , not just a proportionality .",
    "finally note that , even in presence of maxwell fields on the horizon , the above discussion establishes the equality of the komar integral with the _ gravitational term _ in .",
    "a second definition of angular momentum is the one associated with infinity @xcite .",
    "however , the integral at infinity represents the _ total _ angular momentum , including that in the radiation fields outside the horizon .",
    "therefore , in general , one does not expect the two to agree .",
    "indeed , a priori , it is not clear to _ which _ component of the angular momentum at infinity we should compare @xmath204 .",
    "however , this problem disappears if the space - time under consideration admits a global , rotational killing field @xmath210 ( with @xmath270 on @xmath2 ) , whose restriction to @xmath6 is given by @xmath187 .",
    "let us therefore consider this case .",
    "now , since @xmath210 is everywhere a killing field of the space - time under consideration , the vector field @xmath271 on the phase space can only define an infinitesimal gauge transformation .",
    "however , such a gauge transformation defines a degenerate direction of the symplectic structure .",
    "thus , we have @xmath272 for _ all _ tangent vectors @xmath226 at any axially symmetric point @xmath112 of the phase space . therefore , on any connected component of the phase - space @xmath213 consisting of space - times which admit @xmath210 as a killing field , @xmath273 must be a constant .",
    "note , however , that with @xmath274 , @xmath273 has dimensions of angular momentum ( ( length)@xmath275 ) while the theory has no dimensionful constant with that dimension ( recall : the cosmological constant is zero ) .",
    "therefore , hamiltonian itself must vanish .",
    "finally , from ( [ dgen1 ] ) it follows that , on shell , the hamiltonian consists only of two surface terms : @xmath276 we therefore conclude : if the space - time admits a global rotational killing field @xmath210 which reduces to @xmath187 on @xmath6 , then @xmath277 where @xmath204 is the _ total _ horizon angular momentum ( defined by @xmath187 ) .    at first",
    "this result is rather surprising , both mathematically and physically , because one would have expected @xmath278 and @xmath204 to differ from each other by the angular momentum in maxwell field outside the horizon .",
    "however , a closer examination shows that the result is to be expected but for rather subtle reasons .",
    "let us first consider the mathematical aspect . in the axi - symmetric case , it is well - known that @xmath278 is given by the komar integral @xmath279 defined by @xmath210 _ at infinity _ @xcite .",
    "we saw above that the gravitational contribution to @xmath204 equals the komar integral @xmath280 evaluated _ at the horizon_. it turns out that , using the cartan identity , the @xmath210-angular momentum in the bulk electromagnetic field i.e .",
    ", the integral @xmath281 over any partial cauchy surface extending from the horizon to infinity can in fact be expressed as surface integrals .",
    "the term at infinity vanishes because of the fall - off conditions while the term at the horizon is precisely the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath204 .",
    "thus , the bulk electromagnetic contribution to @xmath282-component of angular momentum is already contained in @xmath204 through the maxwell horizon term .",
    "physically , one can understand the situation as follows . in general ,",
    "if @xmath6 extends in the future all the way to @xmath283 , the horizon angular momentum @xmath204 is to be thought of as the angular momentum `` left over at @xmath283 after allowing for radiation '' .",
    "( this is completely analogous to the situation with the horizon mass analyzed in detail in @xcite . ) now , if @xmath282 is a killing vector , there is no radiation of the @xmath282-component of angular momentum , whence the @xmath282-component evaluated at @xmath283 is the same as that evaluated at @xmath284 , whence @xmath285 .",
    "we will conclude with three remarks .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to class i ( i.e. spherically symmetric ) weakly isolated horizons . in this case ,",
    "@xmath286 and @xmath5 are lie - dragged by all three rotational vector fields .",
    "hence , the pull - backs to the spherical sections of @xmath44 and @xmath5 must vanish and the integrand of therefore vanishes .",
    "thus , as one would physically expect , @xmath204 vanishes on all class i horizons .",
    "the vector field @xmath271 determines the hamiltonian @xmath287 only up to an additive constant .",
    "how was this freedom fixed in ? in the case where the cosmological constant vanishes , this constant can be fixed to zero because there is no parameter available in the theory with the correct dimension .",
    "even when the cosmological constant is not zero , the freedom can still be eliminated , e.g. , simply by the physical requirement that horizon angular momentum should vanish in class i. as we just showed , @xmath204 satisfies this condition .",
    "thus , the additive constant is fixed in a natural fashion .",
    "an important question for this framework is whether the event horizon of a kerr  newman black hole is a rigidly rotating isolated horizon and , if so , whether the above definition of angular momentum reproduces the standard result .",
    "the answer , in both cases , is in the affirmative . being killing horizons , these event horizons are in particular weakly isolated horizons and the axi - symmetry of the ambient space - time defines the field @xmath187 on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , these are rigidly rotating isolated horizons .",
    "finally , the discussion above shows that in this case @xmath204 equals @xmath288 , the standard angular momentum @xmath278 defined at infinity .",
    "thus ( as with the horizon mass in the non - rotating case @xcite ) , our horizon angular momentum expression contains not only the `` bare '' angular momentum one may naively associate with the horizon but also the contributions from the electromagnetic hair outside .      to state the first law of black hole mechanics for isolated horizons",
    ", we must first define horizon energy . as with angular momentum in the previous sub - section",
    ", we will base our definition of energy on the hamiltonian generating translations along an appropriate symmetry of the horizon .",
    "however , which particular symmetry @xmath289 would correspond to the desired time - translations is not immediately clear .",
    "therefore , we will begin with an _ arbitrary _ symmetry field @xmath202 . at the horizon , then , it only has to satisfy @xmath290\\quad { \\rm or } \\quad t^a = b_{(\\ell , t ) } \\ell^a - \\omega_{(t ) } \\phi^a\\ ] ] for some _ constants _ @xmath291 on @xmath6 .",
    "( the latter depends not only on the specific choice of @xmath202 but also of @xmath25 $ ] . ) the constant @xmath292 will be referred to as the _ angular velocity of the horizon relative to _ @xmath202 .",
    "note that both the specific element @xmath293 of @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath292 , determined by @xmath202 , can depend on the dynamical fields @xmath112 ; in the numerical relativity terminology , we are considering ` live' evolution vector fields @xmath202 .",
    "this generality is essential in particular because the physically appropriate angular velocity @xmath292 of @xmath6 will vary from one space - time to another .",
    "to summarize , to each point in the phase space @xmath294 , we assign a vector field @xmath202 on @xmath2 satisfying on @xmath6 , allowing the vector field to vary from one point of the phase space to another .    to analyze the question of whether @xmath295 is a hamiltonian vector field on @xmath294 , we must determine whether the right side of hamilton s equations is the exact variation of some hamiltonian .",
    "we have already calculated the quantity in question for an arbitrary vector field @xmath143 in . since the surface terms at infinity are not central to this discussion , as in the angular momentum calculation above , for simplicity let us first assume that @xmath202 vanishes outside of some compact neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "the only potential obstruction to @xmath295 being hamiltonian lies in the horizon surface term of .",
    "being linear in @xmath295 , this surface term defines a 1-form @xmath296 on phase space . from the right side of , @xmath296",

    "let us begin with the first integral .",
    "since @xmath300 is fixed once and for all on @xmath6 , the variation @xmath226 in the second term only affects @xmath292 .",
    "therefore , the second term will simply cancel the part of the first term where the variation hits @xmath292 and we can therefore write the first two terms together as @xmath301.\\ ] ] however , the quantity @xmath292 is constant over @xmath6 and may therefore be pulled outside the integral .",
    "the remaining integrand is exactly the @xmath226-variation of the gravitational contribution to the angular momentum .",
    "analogous procedure can be applied to the second ( i.e. , electro - magnetic ) term of , likewise yielding the electro - magnetic contribution to @xmath217 .",
    "furthermore , since the surface gravity and electro - static potential are both constant over @xmath6 , we can pull them outside the respective integrals and reduces to @xmath302 note that the right side of is strongly reminiscent of the first law of black hole mechanics .",
    "however , at this stage of our analysis , it only provides an explicit expression of the 1-form @xmath296 on @xmath294 .",
    "the condition that @xmath295 be hamiltonian is simply that the 1-form @xmath296 is closed : @xmath303 where @xmath304 and @xmath305 denote the exterior derivative and exterior product on the ( infinite - dimensional ) phase space @xmath294 .",
    "this simple relation leads to some startling consequences which we now discuss .",
    "a priori , the horizon value of @xmath202 can vary from one space - time to another in any smooth fashion ; for each such choice , we obtain a flow on the phase space .",
    "eq implies that most of these flows fail to preserve the symplectic structure . to begin with , for the flow to be hamiltonian , the surface gravity @xmath306 , the angular velocity @xmath292 and",
    "the electric potential @xmath307 can be functions _ only of the area @xmath308 , angular momentum @xmath204 and the charge @xmath309_.$ ] so that @xmath168)$ ] is an isolated horizon with @xmath310 _ and _ another equivalence class @xmath311 $ ] with @xmath312 .",
    "hence , for any values of the triplet @xmath313 , and an evolution field @xmath314 ( with @xmath315 ) , there is a phase space point with @xmath316 and another with @xmath317 .",
    "therefore , irrespective of the choice of @xmath202 , the evolution will fail to be hamiltonian unless we remove the spurious redundancy in the phase space .",
    "this can be naturally accomplished as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath318 the function of the three intrinsic horizon parameters which yields surface gravity in the kerr ",
    "newman family .",
    "we will excise those points from our phase space for which one of @xmath319 vanishes but the other does not .",
    "this excision could have been carried already in section [ s2.3 ] when we introduced the phase space .",
    "we did not do so because the reason behind the excision becomes clear only after .",
    "note that the phase space continues to contain all kerr ",
    "newman solutions , including the extremal ones , after the excision . ] other factors such as the local geometry ( i.e. distortion ) of the horizon can not affect these `` extrinsic parameters '' .",
    "moreover , these parameters must satisfy certain non - trivial relations : @xmath320 now , on any given point @xmath112 in the phase space , @xmath321 and @xmath307 are completely determined by the horizon value of @xmath202 .",
    "conversely , at any given phase space point , @xmath306 uniquely determines the vertical component of @xmath202 and @xmath292 , the horizontal component .",
    "therefore , relations constrain the permissible choices of the assignment of @xmath202 to each space - time in @xmath294 .",
    "these strong restrictions are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the flow generated by @xmath295 on @xmath294 to be hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the restriction to the horizon of a permissible evolution field @xmath202 is determined by this remarkably small set of parameters of the horizon .",
    "note , however , that these arguments do not provide a _",
    "specific _ choice of functions @xmath306 and @xmath292 of the horizon parameters @xmath322 . correspondingly , for _ any _ choice of these functions satisfying , the hamiltonian generating evolution along the corresponding @xmath202 is guaranteed to exist .",
    "( the term at infinity is already an exact variation and is therefore not relevant to our discussion . )",
    "the horizon surface term in that hamiltonian is a natural measure of the _ energy _",
    "@xmath323 of the horizon relative to the evolution field @xmath202 . by virtue of and",
    "the calculations above , the energy @xmath324 is a function only of @xmath30 , @xmath217 @xmath309 and satisfies @xmath325 this is our _ generalized first law _ , which holds for all weakly isolated horizons .",
    "the analogy to the usual first law of black hole mechanics is clear .",
    "let us summarize .",
    "a priori there is freedom to assign an evolution vector field @xmath202 on @xmath2 to every point in the phase space @xmath294 in _ any _ smooth fashion ; each assignment provides an evolution flow @xmath295 on @xmath294",
    ". however , most of these flows fail to preserve the symplectic structure .",
    "they do so if and only if the assignment is such that ( or , equivalently , ) holds .",
    "while this is a severe restriction on the assignment of @xmath202 , as discussed below , it still leaves considerable freedom in the choice of the assignment . for each such `` permissible '' @xmath202 , there is a well - defined horizon energy and the first law holds .",
    "thus , there is a precise sense in which the first law is a necessary and sufficient condition for the @xmath295-evolution to be hamiltonian .",
    "since there is generally no canonical choice of a single , `` correct '' evolution field at the horizon , there is no canonical notion of the horizon energy . while @xmath324 has a direct hamiltonian interpretation in the phase space @xmath294 , for a general permissible @xmath202 it does not admit an obvious _ space - time _ interpretation . in the next sub - section",
    ", we will show that a canonical choice of @xmath202 can be made using no - hair theorems in einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "the corresponding @xmath324 can be interpreted as the horizon mass .",
    "we will conclude with two remarks .",
    "there is a constructive procedure to obtain permissible vector fields .",
    "choose any smooth function @xmath326 of @xmath327 satisfying the following regularity condition for each choice of @xmath328 : the integrals @xmath329 converge to well - defined functions of @xmath217 and @xmath309 , with @xmath330 ( and @xmath326 vanishes if and only if @xmath331 vanishes ) .",
    "then , integrating the first of eqs with respect to @xmath30 and requiring @xmath332 to tend to zero as @xmath30 tends to infinity for any fixed values of @xmath333 , we obtain a unique function @xmath334 .",
    "now , given any point @xmath335 in @xmath294 , there is a unique vector field @xmath202 on @xmath6 such that @xmath336 and @xmath337 ( namely , @xmath338 where @xmath339 is given by @xmath340 ) .",
    "finally , we can integrate the second of eqs with respect to @xmath30 and require that @xmath307 tends to zero as @xmath30 tends to infinity ( keeping @xmath217 and @xmath309 fixed ) , we obtain a function @xmath307 of @xmath327 which satisfies the second and the third of eqs .",
    "thus , given a sufficiently regular function @xmath326 of @xmath327 , we can integrate and , using physically motivated conditions to determine integration constants , obtain an admissible evolution field @xmath202 and electric potential @xmath307 on @xmath6 .",
    "if we now drop the restriction that @xmath202 vanish outside a finite neighborhood of @xmath6 in @xmath2 but require instead that it asymptotically approach a time - translation killing field of the fixed flat metric at infinity , we find that the total hamiltonian has two terms : @xmath341 where @xmath342 is the adm energy . again , general arguments from symplectic geometry imply that @xmath208 is constant on each connected component of stationary solutions , assuming of course that @xmath202 coincides with the stationary killing field in these space - times .",
    "as in the case of angular momentum , we can argue that the value of this constant can only be zero in the einstein  maxwell theory .",
    "thus , in each stationary space - time , the horizon energy @xmath324 equals the adm energy at infinity .",
    "the procedure that led us to the definition of the horizon energy @xmath324 is the same as the one used at spatial infinity to define the adm energy .",
    "however , the boundary conditions at infinity are such that the asymptotic value of the evolution field @xmath202 must coincide with one of the time translation killing fields of the fixed flat metric , whence the space of viable time - translations at infinity is three - dimensional ( corresponding to the unit space - like hyperboloid in the tangent space of @xmath284 ) . on the other hand , at the inner isolated horizon boundary , the physically appropriate @xmath202 necessarily varies from one space - time to another .",
    "in particular , if the horizon is non - rotating , @xmath202 points along the null normal to the horizon while if it is rotating , it has a component also along the rotational symmetry @xmath187 .    in the usual treatments of the first law ,",
    "one restricts oneself to perturbations of stationary backgrounds .",
    "consequently , one can single out a preferred time translation from the 3-parameter family , adapted to the rest frame of the black hole .",
    "the corresponding adm energy is then also the adm mass .",
    "it is natural to ask if we can similarly single out a canonical time translation also at the horizon and introduce the notion of horizon mass .",
    "note that this task is significantly more difficult than the corresponding task at spatial infinity first because the permissible time translations at the horizon form an _ infinite _",
    "dimensional family rather than three and second because , on physical grounds mentioned above , this canonical time translation at the horizon must vary from one space - time to another .",
    "nonetheless , because of the remarkably strong restrictions on the extrinsic parameters @xmath343 and @xmath307 and thanks to the no - hair theorems , there is a natural solution to this problem .",
    "we have just seen in the previous sub - section that the restriction of _ any _ evolution vector field @xmath202 to the horizon is determined by @xmath306 and @xmath292 and if the @xmath202-evolution is to define a hamiltonian flow on @xmath294 , @xmath306 and @xmath292 can only be functions of @xmath344 and @xmath309 .",
    "these three quantities may be regarded as the independent parameters of the horizon .",
    "the problem of defining a canonical time - translation on the horizon therefore reduces to that of making a canonical choice of the two functions @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "now , event horizon of a kerr  newman black hole is in particular a weakly isolated horizon .",
    "it is natural , on these stationary space - times , to choose the evolution field to coincide with the stationary killing field .",
    "this choice selects for us specific functions of the three parameters : @xmath347 where , as before , @xmath348 .",
    "now , although the choice was made _ only _ for stationary cases , since there is exactly one kerr ",
    "newman solution for each set of isolated horizon parameters , this choice uniquely fixes the two functions .",
    "thus , _ we can select a canonical time - translation on any isolated horizon by requiring that the surface gravity and the angular velocity it defines be given by _ .",
    "( this procedure is unambiguous because @xmath349 are determined by @xmath335 without any reference to @xmath202 . )",
    "we will make this choice and denote by @xmath350 any time - translation whose restriction to the horizon coincides with this canonical choice .",
    "the conditions then require us to partially gauge fix the maxwell field such that @xmath351 ( again this is the same value which the electro - static potential of the horizon takes in a kerr  newman solution . ) the evolution generated by such a _ live _ vector field @xmath205 is then guaranteed to be hamiltonian .",
    "we can then `` integrate '' the expression of the first law to find the horizon energy @xmath324 . setting it equal to the mass @xmath207",
    ", we find : @xmath352 again , this gives the usual adm mass for the kerr ",
    ". however , this definition applies to _ all _ isolated horizons including those which admit radiation in the exterior region .",
    "therefore , in general , @xmath207 differs from the adm mass @xmath353 due to the energy in the radiation field . in the einstein - maxwell theory under consideration ,",
    "if the weakly isolated horizon were to extend all the way to @xmath283 in the distant future , @xmath207 can be thought of as the future limit of the bondi mass at @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "if the space - time is globally stationary , there is no flux of radiation across future null infinity @xmath354 whence the future limit of the bondi mass coincides with the adm mass .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that we did not simply postulate ; it was systematically derived using hamiltonian methods .    with this ( quasi-)local definition of the horizon mass , for any preferred time - translation @xmath350 , we have a _ canonical _ generalized first law @xmath355 applicable to all weakly isolated horizons in einstein  maxwell theory .",
    "in this paper , we gave a definition of angular momentum @xmath204 for all rigidly rotating isolated horizons .",
    "the definition is ( quasi-)local to the horizon ; it makes no reference to infinity at all .",
    "in contrast to the usual angular momentum expression @xcite at infinity , @xmath204 has an explicit contribution from the maxwell field on the horizon .",
    "if the space - time in a neighborhood of the horizon is axi - symmetric and the matter fields vanish in that region , @xmath204 equals the usual komar integral formula , evaluated at the horizon .",
    "if the space - time is globally axi - symmetric , irrespective of whether there is maxwell field on the horizon , @xmath204 equals the total angular momentum at infinity .",
    "if the weakly isolated horizon extends all the way to @xmath283 , we can regard @xmath204 as the future limit of angular momentum along future null infinity @xmath354 .",
    "while these properties of the @xmath204 are very similar to those of horizon mass @xmath207 , there is also an interesting difference : whereas in presence of radiation in the exterior region @xmath207 is always different from @xmath353 , if the radiation field is axi - symmetric , @xmath204 equals the angular momentum at infinity ( along the rotational killing vector ) .",
    "we have also generalized the standard first law of black hole mechanics . although the final form of this law is identical to that of the standard one , there are some important differences .",
    "first , our law is applicable to all space - times which admit an isolated horizon inner boundary , including those which allow radiation arbitrarily close to the horizon .",
    "second , all quantities and variations that enter the first law are defined _ locally at the horizon_. in standard treatments , the physical meaning and appropriateness of variations is not as clear because some quantities such as area , surface gravity and the angular velocity of the horizon are defined at the horizon while others , like energy , angular momentum ( and sometimes even the electric scalar potential ) are evaluated at infinity .",
    "third , other treatments based on a hamiltonian framework @xcite often critically use the bifurcate 2-surface which does not exist in the extremal case .",
    "therefore , extremal black holes are often excluded from the first law .",
    "the present analysis never makes reference to bifurcate surfaces ( which do not exist in physical space - times resulting from gravitational collapse ) .",
    "therefore , our discussion of the first law holds also in the extremal case .",
    "finally , with obvious modifications of boundary conditions at infinity , our analysis includes cosmological horizons where thermodynamic considerations are also applicable @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important aspect of this analysis is that it sheds new light on the ` origin ' of the first law : as in the non - rotating case treated in @xcite , it arose as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a hamiltonian generating time evolution .",
    "a new feature of our framework is the existence of an infinite family of first laws corresponding to the infinite family of evolution `` permissible '' vector fields @xmath202 ( i.e. , vector fields satisfying the necessary and sufficient condition for the evolution to be hamiltonian . ) in the einstein ",
    "maxwell case , using the no - hair results , one can select a canonical `` live '' evolution field @xmath356 . correspondingly , there is a canonical notion of energy which can be interpreted as the horizon mass @xmath207 and hence a canonical first law . in more general theories which allow hairy black holes ,",
    "a canonical horizon mass can not be defined on the full phase space . yet , even in this case , the isolated horizon framework is directly useful : it enables one to relate properties of these hairy black holes to those of the corresponding solitons @xcite .",
    "finally , our lagrangian and hamiltonian frameworks are based on real tetrads and lorentz ( rather than self - dual ) connections .",
    "it is therefore quite straightforward to extend our analysis to any space - time dimension .",

    ", we can decompose @xmath143 into vertical and horizontal parts : @xmath358 with @xmath359 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath360 $ ] implies @xmath196 is constrained only by @xmath361 .",
    "the variations @xmath362 and @xmath363 of the potentials become @xmath364 where @xmath365 denotes the restriction of @xmath196 to the past boundary @xmath136 of the horizon .",
    "we can now calculate the action of the symplectic structure on the vector field @xmath218 on @xmath128 .",
    "the derivation of from did not depend on any way on @xmath143 defining a symmetry of the horizon .",
    "we can therefore begin at that point and substitute the new definitions of @xmath233 and @xmath366 to find the analog of for generic horizon diffeomorphisms .",
    "if fact , the result will be quite similar : for any tangent vector field @xmath226 on @xmath128 , we will have @xmath367 - ( \\delta h_w \\vins \\hc ) \\te",

    "( on other sections @xmath138 of the horizon , the surface gravity and electric potential may take other values . ) since the right side contains several terms which are not exact variations , there are a number of possible barriers to the existence of a hamiltonian generating motions along @xmath143 .",
    "however , as we will now show , there are a couple of interesting cases where the required hamiltonian does exists .",
    "consider first the case when @xmath237 is purely horizontal at the horizon , @xmath371 , _ with , moreover , @xmath197 fixed _",
    "( i.e. , independent of the space - time under consideration ) .",
    "thus , @xmath143 generates a fixed diffeomorphism on @xmath6 which preserves the family of cross - sections @xmath372 which , however , need not be a rotation .",
    "since we are interested in the horizon structure , let us also assume that @xmath143 vanishes in a neighborhood of infinity .",
    "then , the integrals at infinity in vanish and only the first two terms in each of the integrals at @xmath138 survive .",
    "moreover , the second term in each integral vanishes because @xmath246 is zero .",
    "thus , the flow generated by these @xmath143 preserves the symplectic structure and the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath373 note that this integral has the same form as the integral used to define the angular momentum in section [ s4 ] .",
    "however , this formula applies to a general weakly isolated horizon , which need not be rigidly rotating .",
    "moreover , the horizontal vector field @xmath197 is arbitrary ; it need not be a killing vector of @xmath12 and indeed it need not even preserve the area - form @xmath374 .",
    "( consequently , we can not re - express in terms of curvatures as in . )",
    "one might hope this formula could be used to define angular momentum in some sense for generic weakly isolated horizons .",
    "however , while the phase space interpretation of is clear , if @xmath197 does not generate rotations , its space - time interpretation is quite obscure .",
    "finally there is another family of vector fields @xmath143 for which the flow @xmath218 on @xmath128 is hamiltonian , although physically less interesting .",
    "let @xmath143 be purely vertical at the horizon , @xmath375 , with @xmath376 .",
    "as before , since we want to focus on the horizon terms , let us assume that @xmath143 vanishes outside some neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "then , terms at infinity in vanish and because @xmath377 , the first two terms in each of the surface integrals at @xmath372 also vanish . finally , since @xmath378",
    ", these remaining terms also vanish .",
    "thus , the entire right side of [ dgen2 ] vanishes .",
    "consequently , the associated @xmath218 is a _ degenerate direction _ of the symplectic structure , whence , from the perspective of the hamiltonian framework , @xmath218 generates a _",
    "gauge transformation_. such transformations have no direct physical interest and may be quotiented out of the algebra of kinematically allowable diffeomorphisms . indeed , since any @xmath143 of the form described above can be written uniquely as a combination of one of these gauge transformations and another kinematically allowable vector field with @xmath196 _ constant _ over @xmath6 , we may restrict attention to the later case without any loss of generality .",
