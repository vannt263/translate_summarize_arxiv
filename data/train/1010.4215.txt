    "supersymmetry is one of the most promising solutions of the hierarchy and fine - tuning problem , namely the vast difference between the electroweak ( ew ) and the planck scale , and the very stability of this difference .",
    "it yields a mechanism for radiatively generating ew symmetry breaking , allows for an exact unification of all forces and conveys a candidate for dark matter .",
    "however , it comes with the price of having new problems , connected to the flavour sector , the stability of the proton , and new sorts of hierarchy problems known as the @xmath2 problem and doublet - triplet splitting . to address these questions ,",
    "models have been developed that derive from a planck or gut scale exceptional gauge group like @xmath0  @xcite , and might be embedded in the context of the heterotic string .",
    "such @xmath0-based models have a matter - higgs unification , are automatically anomaly - free , include the right - handed neutrino , and solve the @xmath2 problem as an effective next - to - minimal susy standard model ( nmssm ) . however , one either has to solve a problem similar to doublet - triplet splitting , or use e.g. an intermediate left - right symmetric model , where the high - scale braking happens through orbifold compactifications  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental representation of @xmath0 , the @xmath3 , contains exotic states which carry both lepton and baryon number and hence act as lepto- or diquarks .",
    "this is why a mechanism as in @xcite is chosen specifically to prevent a phenomenologically disastrous rapid proton decay .",
    "as these exotics are left - chiral superfields ( with vector - like quantum numbers with respect to the ew gauge group ) , they come as a pair of scalars , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , being @xmath1 even , and a dirac fermion , @xmath6 , being @xmath1 odd , at the ew scale . the states are called leptoquarks and leptoquarkinos , respectively .",
    "their potential discovery at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may allow for a direct handle on the gut structure of these models at the tev scale beyond super - precise extrapolation of parameters over 13 - 15 orders of magnitude .    for the rest of this letter , it is sufficient to take the model - building set - up above as a rough motivation how such states could come about in nature , and further on just assume their existence together with the spectrum of an nmssm - like model .",
    "the phenomenology of the scalar leptoquarks is very similar to that of non - supersymmetric states due to their r - even nature and will be discussed in a following publication  @xcite . while the pair production of the fermionic superpartners , the leptoquarkinos , is almost completely determined by qcd , their decays",
    "as @xmath1-odd particles show the very same cascade - like structures as squark and gluino decays .",
    "however , their decay products contain both non - vanishing lepton and baryon number .",
    "hence , kinematic edge structures for the mass determination of new physics states derived from jet - lepton or jet - dilepton exclusive final states have very characteristic features which  using invalid assumptions about the underlying susy model  could lead to wrong particle identifications and mass determinations ( the latter point is particularly relevant , if the scalar states which happen to be usually heavier than the fermions might lie outside the kinematic reach of lhc ) .",
    "the intent of this paper is to first introduce the relevant observables before a brief discussion of the exotic fermion production and decay mechanisms is followed by a dedicated study on the impact of leptoquarkinos with varying masses onto susy squark analysis methods .",
    "here it is the goal to show the essential and important differences between standard susy squark cascades and leptoquarkino - triggered cascades , and why it is important to consider at least both , if not all possible model alternatives .",
    "mass edge variables @xcite have mostly been developed with a certain decay pattern in mind : left - handed squark into a quark , two leptons and the lightest neutralino via the on - shell decays of the second - to - lightest neutralino and a right - handed slepton :    @xmath7    since one is not able to distinguish experimentally which of the leptons @xmath8 and @xmath9 is nearest to the quark ( in terms of the decay cascade ) , two specific observables have been introduced @xcite to allow for a discrimination : @xmath10    as squarks are pair - produced at the lhc , they decay via the above or even simpler patterns leading to final states that may be able to mimic those of the leptoquarkino signals : two hard partonic jets , two or more opposite sign , same flavour ( ossf ) leptons and most importantly large amounts of missing transverse energy .",
    "however , it is crucial to note , that due to the general assumption of minimal flavour violation in the susy lepton sector , flavour is a conserved quantum number and runs like a line through the cascade chain .",
    "hence , ossf leptons originating from squark decays inside a single decay chain are ( up to a simple combinatorical factor ) equally likely than opposite sign different flavour ( osdf ) lepton contributions for standard mssm - type signals , since the branching ratios into first and second generation fermion / sfermion combinations are of the same size in most msugra scenarios .",
    "these osdf signals are coming in the standard mssm paradigm from different flavour decays of pair - produced susy particles .",
    "they are , however , not present in the case of leptoquarkino decays , when we consider flavour - diagonal yukawa couplings and standard fcnc constraints , which allows to suppress large amounts of standard susy backgrounds.    as a selection criterion , we accept events only if they have exactly two hard jets with a minimum @xmath11 of 50 gev . this requirement is intended to suppress one additional collinear initial state radiation jet , for allowed jet multiplicities of three",
    "if we also choose to take jet multiplicities of four into account , we have to be more careful : to avert the contamination by e.g. a gluino pair production signal , we need the third hardest jet to have a maximum @xmath11 of 50 gev , while retaining the cuts above for the two hardest jets . in the cases investigated here",
    "this was sufficient to separate leptoquarkino signals from gluino pair production , however , there is still the possibility from mixed gluino - squark production which is known to be able to be accompanied by possibly harder qcd radiation jets  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it could also appear that jets from decays could be rather soft ( e.g. in sps1a where gluinos and squarks are quite degenerate ) , leading to a confusion with qcd radiation jets .",
    "for leptoquarkino signals this seems not to be overly likely ( because the leptoquarkino renormalization group equations are not so tightly linked as those of squarks and gluinos ) , but is nevertheless possible . for the further analysis presented here",
    ", we just take the rather simplified cut above and assume that the jet backgrounds are under control .",
    "a complete background study is beyond the intent of the present study and is not performed here .",

[",
    "cs : br ] ) .",

    "though this depends on the parameter space of the models , we follow this assumption from here on .",
    "consequently , a typical leptoquarkino decay may be given by @xmath13 whereas a second - to - lightest neutralino in the decay chain starts to become important for heavier masses , leading to different intermediate states , e.g. :    @xmath14        leptoquarkinos produced in pairs thus show the same exclusive final states as squarks , namely two hard partonic jets , two or more leptons and large missing transverse energy in the detector , accounting for the undetected neutralinos .",
    "the influence of the second type of cascade ( [ eq : lqinocasc2 ] ) however is of less importance , since the new majorana decay gives rise to additional osdf lepton contributions , which is absent in the first type of leptoquarkino chain .",
    "additionally , heavier intermediate states are strongly phase - space suppressed and only start to become more important for increasing exotic masses .",
    "consequently , we focus our analysis on the first cascade ( [ eq : lqinocasc1 ] ) with the case of only two ossf leptons being present , as it proves to be the most common exotic decay pattern for the regions in parameter space with relatively light leptoquarks .     and @xmath15 with @xmath16,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   and @xmath15 with @xmath16,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at this early partonic stage , standard analysis methods for lepton - quark mass edges applied to events with dedicated leptoquarkino cascades show strong discrepancies to well - known results from standard susy signals .",
    "the difference emerges due to the intermediate on - shell scalar ( squark or slepton ) between the quark and lepton compared to a majorana fermion as e.g. the neutralino in the mssm : there are no possible spin correlations between lepton and quark , as they are connected through a scalar propagator . as a result ,",
    "their invariant mass spectrum is equivalent to the dilepton spectrum in standard mssm models ( stemming from a scalar slepton propagator ) , in that it linearly rises from zero to its maximum at the endpoint , where it instantly falls down to zero .",
    "this case is not necessarily a unique feature of susy as there are other models with a scalar propagator , which may distort the actual shape of the relevant invariant mass variables ( e.q . in ued , for a general review cf @xcite ) .",
    "however we take the leptoquarkino setup as an application prototype and investigate how such deviations from possible intermediate scalars can arise in the context of a susy decay chain .",
    "a complete knowledge of the particular extended susy model containing leptoquarkinos is not needed for the present study , but will be discussed in a future publication , which in addition will discuss a set of discrete self - consistent parameter points @xcite .",
    "the generic properties of leptoquarkinos , however , could be inferred rather independent of the underlying model setup : they are scalar particles which decay into final states with lepton and baryon number , but because of the assumption of conserved r parity do not show a peak in the corresponding invariant mass distribution .",
    "the smoking - gun signatures are the specific quark - lepton mass edges to be described below in detail , which deviate from standard edges in susy squark and gluino searches .",
    "( such decays could indeed arise from squarks in susy models with @xmath1 parity violation , however , due to constraints from proton lifetime these would be overwhelmingly washed out by the standard susy decays ) .",
    "the flavor structure of leptoquarkinos might be quite interesting , especially when considering third - generation leptoquarkinos involving ( s)tops , ( s)bottoms ( experimentally problematic because of the neutrinos in the final state ) and ( s)taus , but is rather model - dependent and thus we postpone a more comprehensive analysis to  @xcite .    for the comparison of ordinary squark- with leptoquarkino cascades we are exemplarily using the parameter point _",

    "+ returning to the cascade , there still remains the problem of observability : experimentally there is no possibility to select the correct partonic jet and corresponding lepton , which are then to be combined to the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "while in mssm models this would come about due to the presence of the majorana fermion decay into two ossf leptons , in the leptoquarkino case two ossf leptons are to be collected from different cascades , one originating from the leptoquarkino and the other from its antiparticle , respectively .",

    "<S> their susy partners , leptoquarkinos , will appear like all @xmath1-odd particles in decay cascades , but mass edges in kinematic distributions  </S>",
    "<S> originating from the same semi - exclusive final states  will however have major differences to the corresponding edges of ordinary squarks . </S>",
    "<S> this distortion of standard observables bears the opportunity to detect them at lhc , but may also pose a severe confusion of underlying model assumptions , which should be handled with care and , if interpreted falsely , might even prevent a possible discovery .    </S>",
