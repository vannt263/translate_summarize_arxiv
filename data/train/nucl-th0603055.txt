    "superfluidity in nuclear matter has long been studied mainly in pure neutron matter from a view point of neutron - star physics such as cooling rates and glitch phenomena  @xcite .",
    "in addition , that in nuclear matter with finite @xmath2 ratio is also becoming of interest as basic information for the structure theory of finite nuclei , since recent development of ri - beam experiments makes it possible to study @xmath3 medium - heavy nuclei and neutron - rich light nuclei .    at present , there are two ways to describe the fundamental properties such as the saturation property of the finite - density nuclear many - body system ; the non - relativistic and the relativistic models .",
    "they are understood as describing observed properties almost equally . among them , we here adopt the latter . the origin of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) can be traced back to duerr s relativistic nuclear model  @xcite that reformulated a non - relativistic field theoretical model of johnson and teller  @xcite . since chin and walecka succeeded in reproducing the saturation property of symmetric nuclear matter within the mean - field approximation  @xcite ,",
    "qhd has not only been evolving beyond the mean - field approximation as a many - body theory but also been enlarging its objects as a nuclear structure model such as infinite matter @xmath4 spherical @xmath4 deformed @xmath4 rotating nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these successes indicate that the particle - hole channel interaction in qhd is realistic .",
    "in contrast , relativistic nuclear structure calculations with pairing done so far have been using particle - particle channel interactions borrowed from non - relativistic models and therefore the particle - particle channel in qhd has not been studied fully even in infinite matter . aside from practical successes , this situation is unsatisfactory theoretically .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we present an effort to derive an in - medium particle - particle interaction that is consistent with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) although only infinite matter can be discussed at the present stage .    up to now ,",
    "there have been a lot of non - relativistic studies of pairing in nuclear matter . as for the particle - particle interaction entering into the gap equation",
    ", many authors adopted bare interactions whereas others adopted renormalized ones such as @xmath5-matrices . although , in the medium , renormalized interactions would be used intuitively , following reasons support the use of bare interactions : ( 1 ) the green s function formalism leads to the sum of the irreducible diagrams  @xcite , and its lowest order is the bare interaction . ( 2 ) the gap equation itself implies the short - range correlation  @xcite . in general , medium renormalizations are expected to enhance the gap by reducing the short - range repulsion . an interesting exception is the gogny force .",
    "this is known to reproduce the pairing properties given by bare interactions at least at low densities  @xcite .",
    "anyway , as a next step , polarization diagrams should be considered . in the non - relativisitc framework ,",
    "a lot of works have been done to study medium polarization effects on superfluidity in neutron matter  @xcite .",
    "all of them concluded that the medium polarization reduces pairing gap significantly .",
    "a recent ab initio calculation  @xcite , however , claimed that the polarization effect is weak .",
    "studies of polarization effects on symmetric nuclear matter have just begun recently .",
    "reference  @xcite reported that the gap _ increases _ substantially . at the low density limit , ref .",
    "@xcite discussed that in the fermi systems with 4 species the medium polarization enhances the gap .",
    "symmetric matter was also studied in the relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "both of these references reported that the vacuum polarization reduces the gap while the latter reported that the medium polarization enhances the gap .",
    "references  @xcite discussed that the increase of the gap is related to the existence of an instability .",
    "this is known as the liquid - gas instability  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we investigate the liquid - gas instability and its effects on superfluidity in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "results on pure neutron matter are also mentioned briefly .",
    "preliminary results were reported in ref .",

    "the fermi momentum is related to the baryon density as @xmath16 properties of normal fluid , zero temperature matter of a given density is completely determined by the above effective mass equation ( [ effmass ] ) .",
    "the so - called saturation curve or the equation of state is given by the binding energy per nucleon , @xmath17 , as a function of @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "this immediately gives pressure , @xmath20 thermodynamic stability of the matter in the liquid phase is stated as @xmath21 . since the ratio of the sound velocity @xmath22 to the light velocity @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 @xmath25 in fig.[fig1 ] indicates the existence of a mechanical instability to the gas phase . in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath8 = 939 mev , @xmath9 = 550 mev , @xmath10 = 783 mev , @xmath26 = 91.64 , and @xmath27 = 136.2  @xcite .    ,",

    "this is equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",

    "@xmath54 is obtained .",
    "the first and the second terms are called the feynman and the density parts , respectively . the former consists of the antiparticle propagation and a part of the particle propagation , while the latter consists of the hole propagation and the other part of the particle propagation . in the standard fd decomposition , the density dependent @xmath55 part in eq.([pi ] ) is regarded as the particle - hole polarization .",
    "note that the @xmath56 part is pure imaginary and therefore is not necessary for the present purpose . in the pha decomposition , the @xmath57 part in eq.([pi ] ) represents the particle - hole polarization and this directly corresponds to that in non - relativistic calculations  @xcite .",

    "is slightly modified when superfluidity sets in as @xmath68 here @xmath69 . using these equations we calculate superfluidity in nuclear matter assuming that it is in the liquid phase even at the density range in which the liquid - gas instability would occur , as usual .",
    "we set the upper bound of the integrations as 20 @xmath70 .    here",
    ", some discussion about our choice of the interaction is in order . in the lowest order ( the tree level ; @xmath71 )",
    ", @xmath63 reduces to the one boson exchange ( obe ) interaction @xmath72 given by the rmf vertices ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "it has been well known that this obe interaction gives unphysically large pairing gap  @xcite .",
    "its reason can be traced back to the fact that the rmf vertices were tuned only below the fermi momentum . in order to discuss the higher order ( polarization ) effects this obe result",
    "must be improved beforehand .",
    "we accomplish this by introducing a form factor that modulates the high momentum part of the interaction smoothly  @xcite as follows .",
    "note that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite adopted sudden momentum cutoffs so as to reproduce the virtual state in the @xmath73 matrix .",

    "@xcite for the sudden momentum cutoff that reproduces the results of a bare interaction in the pairing calculation . from a general argument ,",
    "the lowest order in the particle - particle channel interaction that gives pairing should be a bare interaction and the particle - hole channel interaction that determines the medium polarization should be an in - medium one in principle . in the present investigation , however , we calculate both the tree and the bubble contributions on the same footing adopting an interaction of in - medium nature , which reproduces the results of a bare interaction in the tree level .",
    "that is , we regard , in a sense , the present rmf - obe interaction with a form factor resembles the gogny force in the non - relativistic pairing calculations .    in order to modulate the high momentum interaction that enters into the pairing calculation",

    "this does not affect the mean field ( hartree ) part with the momentum transfer @xmath75 .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 is determined so as to minimize the difference in the pairing properties from the results of the rmf+bonn calculation , that is , a hybrid calculation performed by adopting single particle states from the rmf model and the bonn potential as the pairing interaction .",

    "these expressions indicate that @xmath80 and @xmath81 carry independent information , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , in strongly - coupled systems , whereas they are intimately related to each other in weakly - coupled ones",
    ". therefore we search for @xmath76 that minimizes @xmath84 with @xmath85 ( @xmath86 @xmath70 ) .",
    "the obtained value is @xmath87 @xmath70  @xcite . for consistency we included the form factor also in the polarization diagrams",

    "this means that superfluidity in the liquid - gas coexistent phase rather than that in the liquid phase should be considered .",
    "however , in the present calculation , we consider the case in which the system stays in the liquid phase also in the instability region ( 0.3 @xmath89 1.3 @xmath70 in the fd case ) as usual .",

    "@xcite . in most of non - relativistic calculations  @xcite ,",
    "decrease of the gap was reported .",
    "this is due to non - occurrence of liquid - gas instability and to the repulsive effect of the spin density fluctuation . in the present model ,",
    "the effect of the transverse @xmath1 polarization that corresponds to the spin density mode is weak .",
    "it is worth noting here that a recent ab initio calculation  @xcite concluded that the polarization effect in pure neutron matter is weak .",
    "it should be stressed that it is an approximation to consider only the medium ( particle - hole ) polarization in the relativistic model ; the vacuum ( particle - antiparticle ) polarization should also be included .",
    "since the gap is sensitive to the tiny remnant of the strong cancellation mentioned above , future inclusion of the vacuum polarization would be important .",
    "this will be studied separately . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the vacuum polarization leads to vector meson mass decrease . in a previous paper  @xcite we examined this meson mass decrease using the in - medium bonn potential and concluded that it reduces the gap .",
    "other ingredients that are not considered in the present study are inclusion of exchange of other mesons like @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and the selfenergy effects  @xcite .",
    "study of superfluidity in the liquid - gas coexistent phase is also an interesting issue .",
