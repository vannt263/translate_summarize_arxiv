    "<S> . we will refer to the diffractive and inclusive processes as ddis and dis respectively .    here </S>",
    "<S> we perform a perturbative qcd analysis of the new high precision ddis data , recently obtained by the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations at hera . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is novel in that it treats individually the components of the pomeron of different transverse size . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the ddis data is based on a purely perturbative qcd framework . </S>",
    "<S> we take input forms of the parton distributions of the pomeron given by the calculation of the lowest - order qcd diagrams for @xmath3 @xcite . in previous analyses , </S>",
    "<S> the pomeron was treated as a hadron - like object of more or less fixed size . </S>",
    "<S> however , the microscopic structure of the pomeron is different to that of a hadron . in perturbative qcd </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that the pomeron singularity is not an isolated pole , but a branch cut , in the complex angular momentum plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pole singularity corresponds to a single particle , whereas a branch cut may be regarded as a continuum series of poles . </S>",

    "<S> each component @xmath6 has its own size , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd dglap evolution of a component should start from its own scale @xmath8 , provided that @xmath8 is large enough for the perturbative evolution to be valid . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the expression for the diffractive structure function @xmath9 contains an integral over the pomeron size , or rather over the scale @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> so to obtain @xmath9 we evolve the input parton distributions of each component of the pomeron from their own starting scale @xmath10 up to the final scale @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the extra integral over @xmath10 reflects the fact that the partonic structure of the pomeron is more complicated than that of a normal hadron .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that in the usual analyses ( for example , by h1 @xcite ) regge factorisation @xcite is assumed , such that the diffractive structure function @xmath12 is the fraction of the proton s momentum transferred through the rapidity gap by the pomeron , @xmath13 is the fraction of the pomeron s momentum carried by the struck quark , @xmath14 is the bjorken @xmath15 variable , @xmath16 is the photon virtuality , and @xmath17 is the squared 4-momentum transfer . ] is written as a product of the pomeron flux factor @xmath18 and the structure function @xmath19 which describes the interaction of the pomeron with the virtual photon probe . </S>",
    "<S> the input pomeron parton distributions are taken to be arbitrary polynomials . the pomeron flux factor is taken from regge phenomenology with some effective pomeron intercept @xmath20 . </S>",

    "<S> an advantage of describing the diffractive dis data using an approach with an explicit integral over the pomeron scale @xmath10 is the possibility to use the results to evaluate the absorptive corrections , @xmath143 , to the inclusive structure function @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections arise during the dglap @xmath145 evolution at each point @xmath146 . with this approach the agk cutting rules @xcite give @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the contribution to the diffractive structure function @xmath34 ( integrated over @xmath57 ) which originates from a perturbative component of the pomeron of size @xmath149 . in a separate paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we use this property to incorporate the absorptive corrections in a parton analysis of inclusive dis data . </S>"
