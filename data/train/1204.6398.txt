    "it is known that severe plastic deformation ( spd ) allows to get materials with sub micro- and nanostructures @xcite , possessing principally new complex of properties .",
    "however , physical principles of creating such materials havent been exposed completely . on this account",
    "it is actual to explore the evolution of materials structure in the spd processes . in materials science ,",
    "the fractal analysis and multifractal parameterization are actively used @xcite as deformed metals structures represent a kind of a self - similar set with grains and grain - boundary generating a network .",
    "such network can be interpreted as the fractal image of the structure . as is generally known ( mandelbrot , 1983 ; feder , 1991 ) , such image is characterized by fractal or the so - called hausdorf dimension which is an important quantative description of the explored objects .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the given work is that evolution of metals structure occurs in a self - similar manner with the formation of fractal structures @xcite , that substantially simplifies their description .",
    "this hypothesis was proved theoretically : assuming that a successive set of high - angular boundaries is prefractal of the same fractal , we have the following estimation for the area of the given set in unit volume of material : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 - characteristic size of fragment , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 - fractal dimension of lines set on the plane crossing high - angular boundary .",
    "the @xmath5 value lies within the limits of @xmath6 .",
    "if the sizes of prefractal elements are distributed in a wide range , the dimension of fractal substantially differs from @xmath7 . if the sizes of elements are approximately identical , the dimension of fractal approaches @xmath7 . according to @xcite at the self - similar stage of fragmentation @xmath8 , with value lying between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and at a final stage , when the sizes of fragments approach the minimum , @xmath11 .",
    "so , the main purpose of this work is to examine above listed hypothesis experimentally     interface of harfa 4.9 soft ware , width=3 ]",
    "the theory of self - similar sets @xcite is the basis of the fractal analysis method .",
    "they can be got by transformation of initial ( half - tone ) images of structures to their black and white ( binary ) ones .",
    "this procedure was carried out by the special programs adobe photoshop @xmath12 , corel draw @xmath13 , image tool @xmath14 . in the given work",
    "the images were got by digitizing microstructures means of a scanner .",
    "there is a principle distinction in the nature of half - tone and binary pictures of structures . on microscope screen",
    "the half - tone picture is constructed by signals of variable amplitude .",
    "so , the contours of objects of the real material structure are determined by conditions of sample preparation ( polishing and etching the specimen ) and have the physical ground . on monitor the type of binary pictures",
    "is determined by the threshold of transformation and depends on the quantity of single pulses ( zeros and unities ) of constant amplitude .",
    "thus , the binary image should be considered as a discrete approximation of characteristic functions of an object or as a statistically - geometric model of the structure . with the successful choice of the threshold of transformation the operation of binarization",
    "does not bring in substantial distortions in statistical data files and conserves scale correspondence in the geometrical parameters of the analyzed objects .",
    "therefore with the visual coincidence of images it is considered that the results of measuring on the black and white images characterize the observed objects of the real structures @xcite .",
    "the explored objects were the approximation of glaze and asphalt structures ( fig.[f4 ] ) ; approximation of iron wire ( fig.[f2 ] )     approximation of iron wire microstructure drawn to different plastic strain ( langford g. a , 1970 ) .",
    "cross section ( a , c , e , g , i ) and longitudinal section ( b , d , f , h , j),width=3 ]     microstructure of molybdenum deformed to different plastic strain ( pbp=0.1 mpa a , c , e;pbp=900 mpa b , d , f ) and the approximation ( pbp=0.1 mpa g , i , k;pbp=900 mpa h , j , l),width=3 ]    and molybdenum ( fig.[f3 ] ) microstructures , deformed by different methods and to different stress @xcite . to count the fractal dimension the so - called `` box counting method '' was used .",
    "it works by covering fractal ( its image ) with boxes ( squares ) and then evaluating how many boxes are needed to cover fractal completely .",
    "repeating this measurement with different sizes of boxes will result in logarithmic function of box size ( x - axis ) and number of boxes needed to cover fractal ( y - axis ) .",
    "the slope of this function is referred as     model nonmetal objects .",
    "glaze ( left ) , asphalt ( right),width=3 ]    box dimension .",
    "box dimension is taken as an appropriate approximation of fractal dimension , complete explanation is @xcite .",
    "the harfa @xmath15 program is in t he basis of this method developed in the institute of physical and applied chemistry , technical university of brno in czech republic .",
    "the given software has been tested on regular fractals , for example the serpinsky carpet @xmath16 .",
    "more detailed description of the given program can be found in @xcite .",
    "the general interface of the program is presented in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "the got binary images of the explored metals structures were analyzed by the harfa @xmath15 program . in the process of analysis",
    "the pattern area structure was varied from @xmath17 percent to @xmath18 percent with the step of @xmath17 percent .",
    "the pattern was also divided into four parts and the obtained constituents were processed",
    "in this paper were analyzed different kinds of materials both metals and nonmetals .",
    "as nonmetals there were model objects glaze and asphalt , they are presented in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "these are natural objects and generated by them network of fragments boundary is generated in stochastic manner .",
    "also we analyzed low deformed ( plastic strain @xmath19 ) metals : iron wire and molybdenum presented in fig.[f2 ] and fig.[f3 ] accordingly .",
    "we can state that for both the nonmetal natural objects and law - deformed metals the fractal dimension remains constant @xmath20 ( fig.[f5 ] )     fractal dimension vs. plastic strain for iron wire .",
    "longitudinal section , width=3 ]    this observation evidences that at low deformations or at recrystallization of metal the process of structure formation is probable . in the given work the fractal dimensionality",
    "is denoted in two ways : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath21 - fractal dimension value of whole studied picture .",
    "@xmath22 - means value of fractal dimension when the picture is divided in four parts . it should be noted ( fig.[f6 ] ) ,     fractal dimension diagrams for different kinds of material , width=3 ]    that @xmath22 < @xmath21 , that in opinion of the authors , speaks about heterogeneity of structural fragments distributing in size .",
    "when fragment sizes approach some @xmath23 the size of @xmath22 will also tend to @xmath21 .",
    "also there is a deviation of points from the straight line because of the got structural pictures is not regular fractals @xcite .",
    "that s why values of fractal dimension vary the limit of variation makes @xmath24 .",
    "dependence of fractal dimension on plastic strain ( cross section ) for iron wire and molybdenum are presented in fig.[f7 ] a. during the deformation of iron wire there is the increase in fractal dimension of structural patterns ( fig.[f6 ] a ) from @xmath25 ( full circle ) at @xmath26 ( full squares ) at @xmath27 and further maintenance at this level that speaks about self - similar structure evolution during severe plastic deformation .    in the case of molybdenum ( fig.[f7 ]",
    "b )     fractal dimension vs. plastic strain for iron wire ( a ) and molybdenum ( b ) cross section .",
    "also self - similarity effect ( a ) and pressure effect ( b ) .",
    ", width=3 ]    the fractal dimension also increases from @xmath25 ( without backpressure ) to @xmath28(with backpressure ) .",
    "difference between the values of fractal dimension for molybdenum without backpressure and with backpressure , is because in the latter case there is a more intensive fragmentation of the material and more fine grain results from the same deformations than in the absence of backpressure .",
    "it follows that the finer the grain the higher fractal dimension in the case of a more uniform distribution of grains , that well correlates with theoretical data @xcite . as a result",
    ", it can be concluded :",
    "in the initial undeformed or recrystallized metal , the same as in nonmetal model objects , the fractal dimension is permanent , @xmath29 . that speaks of the stochastic nature of structure evolution at the initial deformation stage ;    at growth of deformation the fractal dimension grows from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and remains at the given level with further growth of deformation thus speaking about the self - similar process of structure evolution ;      the fractal dimension of structures is an important quantitative characteristic of the deformed metal and undoubtedly requires further study .",
    "it is interesting to compare the fractal dimension with the exponent of degree in the holl - petch law ."
