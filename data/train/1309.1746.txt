    "scattered throughout the recent literature , responding to a renewed interest in studying the ostensibly unique properties of quantum systems , there have been many papers devoted to demonstrating that some aspects of quantum dynamics can be reproduced by classical systems .",
    "these classical systems are often assemblies of classical oscillators and the equivalence to quantum coupled systems stems essentially from the mathematical correspondence between classical eigenfrequencies and quantum eigenvalues .",
    "depending on the system , sometimes the correspondence presented has been merely an analogy , sometimes it has been more exact . however , very few papers point out that the mapping of quantum dynamics as represented by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , can be traced right back to the very first paper applying this equation by dirac @xcite , who showed that the first - order time - dependent coupled equations for quantum state amplitudes are identical to classical hamilton equations . much later",
    "this equivalence was discovered independently by strocchi @xcite but without application .    in previous publications @xcite",
    "we have extended this analysis and in particular shown how , for hermitian quantum hamiltonians , the quantum dynamics corresponds specifically to the classical mechanics of the generalised coupled motion of mechanical or electrical oscillators .",
    "in particular we showed that , although an exact mapping of the tdse is possible , it can lead to rather complicated to realize classical coupled equations involving simultaneously position and momentum coupling of the oscillators .",
    "more standard classical equations , where the coupling between the oscillators is only via the position coordinates , can be achieved in a weak - coupling approximation which we referred to as the `` realistic coupling approximation '' ( rca ) .",
    "indeed almost all previous publications simulating quantum dynamics with classical coupled systems implicitly assume the rca and write down classical oscillator equations without reference to the exact dirac mapping . one aim of our previous work was to assess the accuracy of the rca . to this end , as example , we have shown @xcite that the coherent transfer of electronic excitation between coupled molecules ( for example in the photosynthetic unit ) , often ascribed as due to a manifestation of quantum entanglement , can be simulated exactly by transfer between coupled classical harmonically - oscillating electric dipoles and the rca can give an excellent approximation to the exact dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we wish to explore the consequences of the dirac mapping further , firstly by considering to what extent quantum aspects such as entanglement and quantum gate operation can be reproduced by purely classical motion . as in our previous studies , these applications involve mapping the quantum dynamics of real , hermitian time - independent hamiltonians .",
    "we will show that certain aspects of entanglement measures and quantum gate operation are readily simulated classically . in the more general case of",
    "time - dependent or non - hermitian hamiltonians we demonstrate that quantum interference effects and non - adiabatic transitions can be simulated also .    however , it is also illustrative to see where differences between the quantum and the classical case arise . in this way",
    "we hope to shed light on the oft - discussed problem of quantum / classical correspondence by discussing concrete examples .",
    "it will emerge that the key point of the dirac mapping is that each and every quantum state must be assigned to a separate classical oscillator .",
    "hence , if we have a given number of `` particles '' ( atoms , molecules , spin systems ) with one level each , this system may be simulated by @xmath0 oscillators . however , if each particle has many quantum states the total number of many - body states proliferates and correspondingly the number of classical oscillators required for the simulation . as the simplest but important example , consider a quantum system of @xmath0 two - level `` particles '' ( qubits ) .",
    "each qubit can be represented by @xmath1 classical oscillators giving a total of @xmath2 oscillators .",
    "however the @xmath0 qubits give rise to @xmath3 quantum states , say corresponding to increasing number of qubits in the upper state , all the way from zero to @xmath0 .",
    "hence the simulation of the general coupled system of qubits requires not @xmath2 but @xmath3 classical oscillators . that this proliferation of classical systems with respect to their quantum counterpart , rather than entanglement _ per se _ is what decides the possible exponential advantage of quantum compared to classical computing in performing certain algorithms has been emphasised before , particularly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the modelling of quantum systems by classical oscillators goes right back to pre - quantum days when , for example , lorentz @xcite and holtsmark @xcite described absorption of light by atoms as the excitation of classical oscillating electric dipoles .",
    "this tradition was extended into the quantum mechanics era in the work of fano @xcite on co - operative quantum states modelled by the eigenmodes of coupled classical dipoles and more recently by the simulation of fano resonances by coupled oscillators @xcite or the analogous treatment of electromagnetic - induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "many more examples have been given of classical oscillator simulation of various few - level quantum systems and several of these papers are referred to in ref .",
    "@xcite . hence , as a second problem",
    ", we examine the mapping of the quantum dynamics of more general time - dependent and non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "again it is instructive to consider specific examples and we have chosen two systems ubiquitous in quantum physics , namely , the landau - zener avoided crossing of two quantum states and the interaction of a discrete quantum state with a continuum of states , giving rise to so - called `` fano '' resonances . in both problems",
    "we examine the exact mapping and the utility of the simpler rca coupled equations .",
    "recently , skinner @xcite has extended our previous work @xcite on dirac mapping to include complex hermitian hamiltonians and more general dissipative systems .",
    "in particular , the interesting suggestion is made that in these systems a simulation is more easily realised by doubling the number of classical oscillators .",
    "this suggestion is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the basic classical equations which map the time - development of quantum systems whose wavefunction is expanded in some basis set . in section iii",
    "we examine the question of entanglement measures and show simply how some measures have exact classical counterparts .",
    "also we show that certain operations of quantum computing can be performed readily by classical oscillators .",
    "our aim here is to give concrete , realisable classical systems capable of demonstrating this correspondence in the laboratory .",
    "it emerges that an arrangement of @xmath0 coupled oscillators can mimic _ exactly _ a quantum system of @xmath0 coupled two - level systems , so long as the excitation is confined to one quantum .",
    "however , in the more general case , including all states with up to @xmath0 quanta giving a total of @xmath3 quantum states , then @xmath3 oscillators are required to achieve a simulation .    in section",
    "iv we discuss time - dependent hamiltonians and examine simulation of the celebrated landau - zener non - adiabatic transition as example .",
    "section v is devoted to the question of non - hermitian hamiltonians in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the consequences of the results are discussed in the concluding section vi .",
    "@xcite , to be referred to as paper i , it was shown how the coupled time - dependent schrdinger equation for the complex amplitudes of a quantum level system involving a finite number of levels can be mapped to the newton equations of the same number of coupled classical oscillators .",
    "here we re - iterate this mapping briefly for the case of a real and time - independent quantum hamiltonian .",
    "later we will extend to complex and time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "the basis set expansion , @xmath4 of solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , where the @xmath5 are complex co - efficients and @xmath6 denotes an arbitrary orthonormal time - independent basis , leads to a set of coupled equations ( we use units such that @xmath7 ) , @xmath8    in the special case that all matrix elements @xmath9 are real the tdse coupled equations ( [ eq : tdse ] ) are equivalent to classical hamilton equations i.e. @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 real momenta and positions , if the classical hamiltonian function is taken as the expectation value of the quantum hamiltonian i.e. @xmath14 the hamiltonian becomes @xmath15 which is that of coupled real harmonic oscillators .",
    "note that the coupling is of a very special form in which there is both bi - linear position and momentum off - diagonal coupling with exactly the same coupling strengths .",
    "we will call the equations of motion derived from this hamiltonian the `` p - and q - coupled equations '' .",
    "the hamilton equations resulting from a time - independent quantum hamiltonian are @xmath16 taking the time derivative of the @xmath17 equation and inserting the @xmath18 equation one obtains @xmath19 a similar equation can be obtained for the momenta @xmath12 .",
    "symbolically , writing @xmath20 and @xmath21 as vectors and @xmath22 as a matrix the above equations are @xmath23 and formally @xmath24 which are a set of coupled oscillator equations and can be solved for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . typically , in a physical realisation of the coupled classical oscillators one would measure the positions @xmath13 and the velocities @xmath27 .",
    "however , to construct the quantum amplitudes one needs @xmath28 , i.e.  the momenta @xmath12 .",
    "the momenta at time @xmath29 can be calculated from @xmath30 the set of complex amplitudes , the vector @xmath31 , is constructed as @xmath32 from the hamilton eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hameq ] ) we have @xmath33 similarly the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : tdse ] ) is written @xmath34 or @xmath35 which is exactly the classical equation ( [ eq : ddotz ] ) and makes the similarity to the equations of a set of coupled classical oscillators obvious , at least formally .",
    "hence the p- and q - coupled classical equations and the coupled quantum schrdinger equations are identical .",
    "it is clear that the form of the above equations ( [ eq : clcoupled ] ) and ( [ eq : ddotz ] ) are also applicable when @xmath36 is complex .",
    "this will be illustrated in section [ sec : dissipative ] where coupling of dissipative states is considered .",
    "one prominent example of an entangled quantum system is the excitonic j band formed by certain aggregates of dye molecules .",
    "the eigenstates ( known as frenkel excitons ) forming the j - band states of such a system are linear combinations of states in which one molecule is electronically excited and all others in their electronic ground state .",
    "we call these states @xmath37 where the @xmath38 molecule is excited . note that within this so - called one - exciton manifold the states @xmath37 can be readily identified with the states @xmath6 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis_expansion ] ) . therefore",
    ", quantum mechanical excitation of a certain molecule can be associated , within the classical mapping , with oscillation of the corresponding classical oscillator @xcite .",
    "thilagam @xcite has studied the entanglement dynamics of a j aggregate by calculating the entanglement measures of von neumann entropy and concurrence .",
    "she suggests that `` the entangled properties highlight the potential in utilizing opto - electronics properties of j - aggregate systems for quantum information processing '' .",
    "these measures are constructed from the density matrix whose elements are composed of bi - linear products of the complex amplitudes @xmath5 . however , since these complex numbers are identical to the classical @xmath39 numbers , it is clear that these entanglement measures are reproduced _",
    "exactly _ by the classical dynamics .",
    "hence this is a completely classical reproduction of `` quantum entanglement '' .",
    "we emphasise that the simulation of the entanglement of quantum _ states _ by classical oscillators is quite general as far as the entanglement measures ( e.g.  entropy , concurrence , negativity , quantum discord ) are calculated using density matrix elements , written as binary products of amplitudes , since these are identical in quantum and classical dynamics .",
    "note however , in the j - aggregate excited state considered by thilagam , we only have one excitation shared between @xmath0 oscillators and hence our excited - state hilbert space is of dimension @xmath0 and can be mapped exactly onto @xmath0 classical oscillators where initially only one oscillator is excited .",
    "thus it is the restriction to the one - exciton space that allows one to associate a localised excitation on a certain monomer with a single classical oscillator . in the case of more than one excitation in the system",
    ", there will be quantum states which contain excitation on two ( or more ) molecules .",
    "such a state would map to its own oscillator , thus the simple correspondence molecule - oscillator no longer holds .",
    "this is another example of the necessity , mentioned in the introduction , to have more classical oscillators as the number of excited quantum two - level systems increases .    in view of the ability of classical coherent coupled motion to reproduce certain aspects of what is viewed as a purely quantum effect",
    ", it appears apposite to examine other features of quantum information processing to ascertain which aspects are reproduced by classical coupled oscillator motion . to do this the basic ingredients of quantum information",
    "must be simulated classically .",
    "the most important of these are definition of a qubit , its rotation on the bloch sphere and the coupling ( entanglement ) of two qubits in the construction of quantum gates .",
    "these questions are examined in the following sections .",
    "we first define a classical state of a pair of oscillators which corresponds to the state of a single quantum 2-level system , a qubit .",
    "then we show that by changing the amplitude and phase of the classical oscillators we can perform arbitrary rotations on the bloch sphere . in paper i we have pointed out that the complex amplitudes of monomer eigenstates coupled into a quantum dimer are identical to suitably - defined classical complex amplitudes of coupled oscillators .",
    "essentially these results are the same as given in section iiia but restricting the excitation to @xmath40 monomers . here",
    "the states of coupled classical oscillators will be defined in a way that allows quantum gate operations to be performed with them .",
    "we consider the quantum monomer to consist of only two states , a ground state and an excited state denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "these two states can constitute a qubit .    to define a qubit , in the standard notation we consider a linear superposition of the two states , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with complex coefficients . generally , up to an irrelevant overall phase",
    ", one can take the co - efficient of @xmath41 to be real and non - negative and define a state on the bloch sphere by @xmath43 where the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the usual angles defining the unit sphere . then the state is normalised @xmath46 ,",
    "the state @xmath41 is at the north pole and @xmath42 at the south pole .",
    "in addition particular superpositions of these states can be used as basis .",
    "clearly the position on the bloch sphere is defined by a single complex number subject to the normalisation condition . according to the mapping prescription",
    ", a classical oscillator corresponds to each of the two states .",
    "the motion of each oscillator is uniquely defined by the two real numbers of maximum amplitude and phase , from which the complex number @xmath28 may be specified . hence there are four real numbers specifying the classical `` qubit '' . however , as in the quantum case only relative phase is significant , which eliminates one number . in the classical case , conservation of total energy of the two oscillators gives a relation between amplitudes and plays the role of normalisation in the quantum case .",
    "hence only two real numbers specify the complex number locating the pair of oscillators on the bloch sphere and the state of the oscillators can also be described symbolically by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bloch state ] ) .",
    "+ in the quantum case the rotation on the bloch sphere is achieved by allowing the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 to interact for a time to form a new linear superposition .",
    "this time development is a unitary transformation .",
    "the same is true classically , the corresponding two oscillators interact for a time and unitrarity is mapped to the classical dynamics by ensuring energy conservation during the interaction . since this interaction of two states is the cornerstone of our simulation we examine the transformation in some detail .",
    "+ we consider two arbitrary quantum states , for simplicity but without great loss of generality which we take to be degenerate in energy ( in real systems slight non - degeneracy is often desirable to inhibit interaction but may be lifted by application of external fields ) .",
    "we will call the two states , as above for a qubit , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a coherent superposition of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is achieved by switching on an interaction @xmath47 between the two states for a certain time .",
    "the coupled qubit has @xmath48 and @xmath49 eigenstates of the form , @xmath50 with eigenenergies @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the energy of the pair of states ( which can be put to zero )",
    ". then one can show ( see paper 1 ) that a general solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) can be written , @xmath53   \\cos [ vt/\\hbar]\\\\ c_2(t ) = - i \\exp[-(i/\\hbar ) \\epsilon t ]   \\sin [ vt/\\hbar ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] which are the exact quantum solutions and describe a periodic transfer of energy between the two states .",
    "a particular change in amplitude and phase can be achieved by choosing the coupling time and so a rotation on the bloch sphere is performed .",
    "exactly the same transformation can be made using the two classical oscillators .",
    "when mapped to the hamilton equations , the hamiltonian of the two coupled quantum states gives rise to classical equations of motion for the displacements @xmath54 and @xmath55 of two identical coupled pendula of natural frequency @xmath56 .",
    "the coupled oscillator equations ( derived in paper i ) are , @xmath57 in the usual way these symmetric equations can be diagonalised by the transformation @xmath58 to give normal modes satisfying the uncoupled equations @xmath59 with eigenfrequencies @xmath60 .",
    "as they should be , these are exactly the eigenfrequencies @xmath61 of the quantum two - state problem derived above",
    ". then one can show that the classical complex amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath63 obey exactly the same equations as the quantum amplitudes @xmath64 of eq.([eq : c1quant ] ) .",
    "again by choosing interaction time and strength of coupling the relative amplitudes can be changed arbitrarily .",
    "a relative phase change simply requires a change of the phase of one oscillator .",
    "accordingly one sees that the operation leading to the quantum mixing of the two qubit states , or rotation on the bloch sphere , also can be performed exactly by a pair of classical coupled oscillators .",

    "clearly this simple quantum gate can be simulated by the classical oscillators by bringing them into interaction to form the eigenmodes @xmath71 .",
    "+      in the dimer composed of two qubits we will denote the states with a double index , the first referring to monomer @xmath72 , the second to monomer @xmath73 .",
    "then the absolute ground state is denoted @xmath74 .",
    "the doubly - excited state is then @xmath75 .",

    "the first , called the @xmath83 gate , involves mixing of only two of the four states which we take here to be the @xmath84 and @xmath85 states .",
    "this gate simply swaps the amplitudes of the two states involved and hence can be achieved as is done in the rotation of a single qubit .",
    "for example , starting with unit amplitude @xmath86 for state @xmath84 and zero amplitude @xmath87 for state @xmath85 , after an interaction time @xmath29 the amplitudes are given exactly by eq .",

    "the rca is only valid when @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "although the latter condition is easily satisfied , the former does not hold in general .",

    "the equivalent classical hamiltonian is a function of the quantum hamiltonian matrix elements in the basis of @xmath0 eigenstates .",

    "further we showed that classical qubits can be defined and bloch rotations and all fundamental two qubit gate operations performed also by coupling classical oscillators .",
    "however , since from @xmath0 qubits one can build a total of @xmath3 quantum states , then , as @xmath0 itself becomes large , one would need an exceedingly large number of @xmath3 oscillators to achieve the simulation .",
    "of course , this is precisely the departure point between quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "also , if the quantum system is composed of individual subsystems a corresponding decomposition of the system of classical oscillators can usually not be achieved .",
    "that is , in general there is no one - to - one correspondence between classical oscillator and quantum subsystem .",
    "one should also mention the difference in the measurement process required to ascertain the complex amplitudes . in the classical case , since",
    "the dynamics is deterministic , the amplitude and phase can be measured directly . in the quantum case",
    "the same numbers are obtained as the statistical averages of many measurements .",
    "for example in the case of the sqisw quantum gate employed in @xcite , of the order of one thousand measurements are required to achieve the necessary accuracy .",
    "we have considered the extension to time - dependent and non - hermitian quantum hamiltonians , using the two - state lz problem and decaying states as the simplest examples .",
    "again , here an exact mapping is possible but gives rise to more complicated newton equations of motion involving off - diagonal velocity couplings .",
    "nevertheless , in principle these terms can be simulated , either by damping or driving , as in the case of electrical oscillator circuits with negative resistance , for example .",
    "however , in the rca , which requires that the coupling between oscillators is weak , the complicated exact equations simplify to a standard form without such off - diagonal velocity couplings . we have shown that the rca equations give excellent agreement with exact quantum results when the weak coupling criterion is satisfied .",
    "recently , an alternative way to achieve standard coupled - oscillator classical equations has been proposed@xcite .",
    "this is to recognise that the @xmath12 variables in the uncoupled limit are also harmonic and therefore to treat the momenta as the position variables of @xmath0 additional classical oscillators .",
    "although this doubles the number of independent oscillators required for the mapping , it has the advantage that the troublesome velocity couplings are eliminated .",
    "hence , although not necessary for real hermitian hamiltonians , doubling the number of oscillators can be advantageous for non - hermitian ( and also for time - dependent ) hamiltonians when the number of states @xmath0 is not large . which of the two schemes is simpler to realise in practice will depend upon the precise nature of the quantum problem at hand . without claiming to encompass all possible scenarios",
    ", we would maintain that in most cases of practical simulation , the use of @xmath0 coupled oscillators satisfying the rca , leading to standard coupled equations as illustrated above will furnish sufficient accuracy .",
    "this is because weak coupling is necessary to maintain the linearity of the oscillator and coupling forces with displacement i.e. to satisfy hooke s law or its electrical equivalent .",
    "if higher accuracy is required one must additionally simulate the couplings neglected in the rca or resort to @xmath2 oscillators according to skinner s prescription @xcite .",
    "however , it should always be remembered that the truncated set of _ quantum _ equations in the examples used here is also an approximation .",
    "any actual quantum system would show deviations from the predictions of our schrdinger equation since inevitable coupling to states not included in the truncated basis is not taken into account .",
    "this is the quantum analogue of non - linear terms neglected in the classical simulation and , as in that case , would be a more serious approximation when the coupling becomes strong .",
