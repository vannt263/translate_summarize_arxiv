    "the inequalities obtained from complete joins of antiwebs , called _ joined antiweb constraints _ , are of the form @xmath157 where @xmath158 are different antiwebs and @xmath159 is a clique ( note that the inequalities are scaled to have right hand side equal to 1 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath160 the linear relaxation of @xmath1 obtained by all joined antiweb constraints .",
    "then , a graph @xmath3 is joined a - perfect if @xmath1 equals @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , shepherd @xcite showed that the stable set polytope of a near - bipartite graph has only facet - defining inequalities associated with complete joins of a clique and prime antiwebs .",
    "thus , every near - bipartite graph is joined a - perfect ( but the converse is not true since there exist perfect graphs that are not near - bipartite , see figure [ fig_notnearbip ] for an example ) .",
    "such that removing @xmath71 and its neighbor(s ) leaves a non - bipartite graph . ]    moreover , conjecture [ conjecture ] identifies @xmath0-perfect graphs and graphs for which its stable set polytope can be described by inequalities with near - bipartite support . it is known that , given a graph @xmath3 , every facet defining inequality of @xmath1 with support graph @xmath27 is a facet defining inequality of @xmath161 .",
    "then , again by shepherd s results @xcite , those graphs for which its stable set polytope can be described by inequalities with near - bipartite support are joined a - perfect graphs .    taking this into account , conjecture [ conjecture ]",
    "can be reformulated as follows :    every @xmath0-perfect graph is joined a - perfect .",
    "the results of lovsz and schrijver @xcite prove that joined a - perfect graphs are @xmath0-perfect , thus , the conjecture states that both graph classes coincide and that @xmath160 shall be the studied polyhedral relaxation of @xmath1 playing the role of @xmath8 in .    in particular ,",
    "in this paper we have proved that every @xmath0-perfect line graph is h - perfect .",
    "then , combining these results , we obtain that a line graph is joined a - perfect if and only if it is h - perfect .",
    "however , it seems natural to look for a proof of the latter result independent of the @xmath0-operator .",
    "a line graph is joined a - perfect if and only if it is h - perfect .",
    "a joined a - perfect graph has as only facet - defining subgraphs complete joins of a clique and prime antiwebs .",
    "following the same argumentation as in @xcite that odd antiholes are the only prime antiwebs in complements of line graphs , we see that odd holes are the only prime antiwebs in line graphs .",
    "analogous arguments as in @xcite yield that in a line graph , no complete join of a clique and odd holes or of two or more odd holes can occur : every such complete join would particularly contain an odd wheel @xmath162 , i.e. , the complete join of a single node and an odd hole @xmath9 .    the @xmath163 is one of the minimal forbidden subgraphs of line graphs by beineke @xcite , larger odd wheels contain a claw , another minimal forbidden subgraph of line graphs by @xcite .",
    "thus , the only remaining facet - defining subgraphs in a joined a - perfect line graph are cliques and odd holes .",
    "conversely , an h - perfect line graph is clearly joined a - perfect .",
    "our future lines of further research include    * to look for new families of graphs where the conjecture holds ( e.g. , by characterizing the minimally @xmath0-imperfect graphs within the class ) ; * to find new subclasses of @xmath0-perfect or joined a - perfect graphs .",
    "in all cases , the structural results would have algorithmic consequences since the stable set problem could be solved in polynomial time for the whole class or its intersection with @xmath0-perfect or joined a - perfect graphs by optimizing over @xmath42 .",
