    "here we continue addressing the full  ranged counterpart of the model , for which mathematical results have been produced @xcite as well ; the treatment was based on reflection positivity @xcite , and proved the existence of an ordering transition at finite temperature , as predicted by spin  wave theory .",
    "the interaction model studied here has long - range tails expected to alter the critical behavior of its counterpart investigated in ref .",
    "our results show a downward shift of the critical temperature , and , in addition , lead to different values of critical exponents , as well as critical amplitudes , thus pointing to a class of universality beyond the nearest ",

    "@xcite .",
