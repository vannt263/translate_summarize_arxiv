    "since the discovery of the cosmic expansion acceleration in 1998 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of the most debated questions in physics and cosmology has been the existence and nature of the so - called dark energy , which should account for that unexpected phenomenon .",
    "indeed , a repulsive force acting in the universe space - time defies any previous physical knowledge , as the only known interaction among matter on these large scales is the universal newton - einstein gravitational attraction .",
    "both the classical ( newtonian ) and relativistic ( einsteinian ) theories of gravitation seem to exclude that gravity can be in some way repulsive .",
    "however , in two recent papers @xcite showed that the general theory of relativity can be consistently extended to the existence of antimatter ( which was unknown at the epoch of the birth of the two theories ) , based on its cpt properties , which imply that matter and antimatter are both gravitationally self - attractive , but mutually repulsive .",
    "thus , if our universe contains a certain amount of antimatter ( possibly equivalent to the matter one , due to the expected matter - antimatter symmetry ) , the origin of the cosmic speed - up can be easily and naturally explained ( together with the well - known expansion itself ) , without any need of mysterious ingredients like a physically unknown dark energy , or of modifications to the current well - established theories .",
    "thus far , the universe acceleration , i.e.  the presence of the elusive dark energy , has been formally ascribed to an additional term having a negative pressure in the cosmic - expansion equations , in the simplest case corresponding to a cosmological constant , perhaps associated to the energy of the quantum vacuum . besides this standard cosmology of the @xmath0cdm model , various alternatives have been proposed to explain the accelerated expansion , invoking scalar fields or modifications of general relativity , such as extensions to extra dimensions or higher - order curvature terms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for an extensive and detailed discussion ( and bibliography ) on alternative models of dark - energy cosmologies see the recent review by @xcite .",
    "the main problem with the connection of dark energy with the quantum vacuum energy is that the latter would be expected to be some @xmath5 times larger than observed , or at least @xmath6 when considering only quantum chromodynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , starting from the assumption of repulsive gravity between matter and antimatter , @xcite has shown that dark energy could be the result of the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum , while in previous papers @xcite the author showed that also dark matter could be an illusion caused by the same phenomenon .",
    "this treatment of quantum vacuum virtual pairs leads to much more reasonable theoretical values for the associated dark energy , but not yet in agreement with observational estimates .",
    "another big problem in this sense is the so - called  coincidence \" problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) : why should the dark energy density be so comparable ( a small factor larger ) with the energy density of matter , and why just now in the history of the universe ( while , being constant in the @xmath0cdm model , in the past it would have been so negligible and in the future it will dominate ) ?",
    "thus , one suspects that actually the repulsive force could be closely related to the matter content , as we will show in this paper . in sect .  2 we present the basis of general relativity extended to the presence of antimatter , while in sect .",
    "3 we apply it in a cosmological model , whose results are submitted to the main observational tests in sect .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "antimatter gravity has a long and troubled history , which begins with the belief that gravity can be only attractive and never repulsive , then this concept passes through phases of questioning and contestation , to reach a growing consensus towards the possibility that the gravitational interaction between matter and antimatter is repulsive .",
    "the main steps of this story can be drawn from many works of various authors , e.g.  @xcite ; and references therein .    here",
    "we start from the assumption that antimatter is cpt - transformed matter and , as already partially done in @xcite , show how gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter is a natural outcome of general relativity , and derive the relevant field and cosmological equations .      in a metric theory of space - time",

    "which are both ( c)pt - invariant with all terms ( c)pt - even , we can get the well - known geodesic equation , i.e.  the four - component equation of motion of general relativity , @xmath21 where the christoffel symbol @xmath22 represents the ( matter - generated ) gravitational field .    as pointed out by @xcite , this equation",
    "is composed of four ( c)pt - odd elements .",
    "if we cpt - transform all the four elements , we obtain an identical equation describing the motion of an antimatter test particle in an antimatter - generated gravitational field , since all the four changes of sign cancel one another .",
    "thus , this cpt symmetry ensures the same self - attractive gravitational behavior for both matter and antimatter .",
    "however , if we transform only one of the two components , either the field @xmath23 or the particle ( represented by the remaining three elements ) , we get a change of sign that converts the original gravitational attraction into repulsion , so that matter and antimatter repel each other ) , except for the parameter @xmath24 , which can no longer be taken as the proper time , being @xmath25 , but it will be an affine parameter describing the world line . thus , a ( retarded ) photon will be repelled by an antimatter - generated gravitational field , and a cpt - transformed photon , i.e.  an advanced photon , will be repelled by matter . ] .      in order to obtain a generally covariant field equation",

    "but this scenario is highly unlikely , since matter and antimatter repel each other ( or , alternatively , they would annihilate each other ) .",

    "we would have matter  particles \" surrounded by antimatter ones , and vice versa , which means that each particle feels more the repulsive effect of the closer opposite particles than the attractive one from the more distant like particles , which gives rise to a global expansion and could also prevent the final aggregation into two distinct blocks . anyway , we focus on this situation , which resembles that of our universe , where matter is organized in superclusters separated by vast cosmic voids , in which , according to @xcite , equivalent amounts of antimatter may be hidden .    in the standard general theory of relativity ( i.e.  that not extended to cpt - transformed matter ) , the field source in eq .",

    "starting from the basic assumptions that antimatter is cpt - transformed matter and that our universe is matter - antimatter symmetric , we have developed a cosmological model where , consistently with general relativity , gravitational repulsion between the two opposite components is the cause of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",

    "i.e.  a crystal ) the alternation of opposite charges ( whose interaction is attractive ) provides a net binding energy in spite of a null total charge , the alternance of unlike gravitational charges in the cosmos produces a net accelerated expansion in spite of the equal amounts of the two components . similarly to the madelung constant in crystals , the degree of resulting repulsive energy is measured by the parameter @xmath58 , which we supposed to be in the range 1.52.5 , and which multiplies the matter ( or antimatter ) energy density in the cosmological equations , thus together providing a single parameter .",
