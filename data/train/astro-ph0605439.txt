    "the formation of the first stars marks the end of the cosmic dark age and the beginning of the reionization era .",
    "the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath3cdm ) of structure formation predicts that the first stars were formed in dark matter halos of @xmath4 , which were sufficiently massive to allow the halo gas to collapse and cool through emission in molecular hydrogen roto - vibrational lines ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . numerical simulations and analytic arguments suggest that in the absence of heavy elements , the gas in the halo center will cool hydrostatically and collapse into a central object when the jeans mass is @xmath5 , probably resulting in the formation of one or a few stars with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "stars of this mass live for only @xmath7 @xcite . at the end of their lives the supernova explosions enrich the intergalactic medium with heavy elements , which accelerate the cooling process and allow less massive stars to form . the reionization of the medium advances as more sources of ionizing radiation ( stars or black holes emitting light as quasars ) are formed in increasingly massive halos .",
    "a very powerful observational probe of the end of the dark age is 21-cm tomography , which provides information on the state of the atomic intergalactic medium ( igm)(@xcite , for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hydrogen atoms interact with 21-cm photons by radiative transitions between the hyperfine split ground state .",
    "the hydrogen may be seen in emission or absorption against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) depending on whether its spin temperature is above or below the cmb temperature .",
    "the spin temperature is a weighted average of the gas kinetic temperature and the cmb temperature : it is driven toward the cmb temperature by the 21-cm transitions , and towards the kinetic temperature by atomic collisions and by resonant scattering of ly@xmath0  photons @xcite . during the dark age (",
    "before the appearance of sources of light such as stars or accreting black holes ) , the kinetic temperature drops below the cmb temperature because of adiabatic cooling , and collisional coupling of the spin and kinetic temperatures can produce an absorption signal @xcite .",
    "collisional coupling becomes ineffective below a redshift @xmath8 , except in high density regions such as collapsed minihalos @xcite . at lower redshift",
    ", the gas may again appear in absorption when illuminated with the ly@xmath0  photons from the first sources , which also couple the spin and kinetic temperatures through the wouthuysen - field mechanism @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the ionizing photons from the same first sources start heating the neutral medium , due mainly to soft x - rays which penetrate deeper into the atomic regions @xcite .",
    "the 21-cm fluctuations are then due to variations of neutral density , ly@xmath0  flux and spin temperature @xcite . as reionization proceeds , x - rays heat the kinetic temperature to values much higher than the cmb temperature , and at the same time a ly@xmath0  photon background is produced which strongly couples the spin and kinetic temperatures .",
    "the 21-cm fluctuations are then essentially proportional to the density of neutral hydrogen , dependent on the igm density and the ionization state @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the 21-cm signature of the first stars , when the region around a star is illuminated by ly@xmath0  photons for the first time after the recombination epoch . before a ly@xmath0  photon background is created",
    ", the spin temperature is close to that of the cmb temperature at most spatial locations .",
    "however , near a first star , the ly@xmath0  photon flux is strong enough to change the spin temperature , rendering the medium observable with 21-cm tomography .",
    "this region is substantially greater than the hii region generated by the star and the virial radius of the star - forming halo , as we shall see below .",
    "we shall refer to such a region as a _",
    "ly@xmath0 sphere_. the gas in the inner part of a ly@xmath0  sphere is heated up quickly by the radiation of the star ( which , owing to the surface temperature @xmath9 k of massive , metal - free stars , emits substantial soft x - rays during the main - sequence lifetime ) to a temperature above @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , this inner region produces instead a core of 21-cm emission . the heating rate is much lower at the outer part of the ly@xmath0  sphere . depending on the spectrum and the age of the star",
    ", the gas in the outer part of the ly@xmath0  sphere should appear as a halo of 21-cm absorption .",
    "this outer halo of absorption is not present if the region has been illuminated before by a sufficiently strong background of soft x - rays , and therefore heated by other more distant sources prior to the appearance of the star .",
    "therefore , the detection of the absorption halo provides a unique signature of a first star .",
    "as this work was being completed , we became aware of the work by cen ( 2006 ) along similar lines .",
    "our conclusions differ from those of cen in two respects : first , we find that ly@xmath0  spheres of absorption would be produced only around the very first sources of light in the universe , which should be metal - free stars ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . at later times",
    ", the medium should be rapidly heated by x - rays and a global ly@xmath0  background should be produced , eliminating the ly@xmath0  spheres .",
    "second , the most important source of ly@xmath0  photons that couple the spin and kinetic temperatures around a first star are not the continuum photons from the stellar photosphere , but the secondary ly@xmath0  photons due to impact excitations by electrons produced by the x - rays themselves . as we shall see in this paper ,",
    "this fact is essential for improving the observability of these ly@xmath0  spheres in 21-cm absorption , by increasing their contrast relative to the background .    in  2",
    ", we derive the properties of an individual ly@xmath0  sphere . in ",
    "3 we investigate the formation history of the first stars . the growth of the ly@xmath0  and soft x - ray backgrounds , which affect the global evolution of the kinetic and spin temperature of the igm , is considered in  4 . in  5 , we consider the observability of these ly@xmath0  spheres .",
    "we summarize our results in  6 . in the following",
    ", we have adopted the wmap three year @xmath3cdm model , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the form of the ly@xmath0  sphere produced around a first star , detectable by means of the 21-cm emission and absorption , is determined by the intensity of ly@xmath0  photons and soft x - rays produced over the history of the stellar lifetime . as a result of the irradiation of the neutral medium by stellar ultraviolet light , ly@xmath0  photons",
    "are produced by two mechanisms : they may have been emitted directly from the stellar photosphere at a frequency in the range between ly@xmath0  and ly@xmath16 and then redshifted to ly@xmath0  , or they may result from ionizing photons which can ionize hydrogen atoms that subsequently recombine and also excite other hydrogen atoms with the energetic electrons created in the ionizations . following @xcite , we designate the first type _ continuum _ photons , since they enter the ly@xmath0  line from the continuum spectrum on the blue wing of the line , and the second type _ injected _ photons , since they are injected close to the line center by an atom that has recombined or has been excited by a secondary electron , and has then reached the 2p state .",
    "we note that injected photons may also originate from photons emitted between the ly@xmath17 line and the lyman limit by the star , which will be absorbed by a hydrogen as they reach a lyman resonant line , and may then produce a ly@xmath0  photon if the hydrogen atom cascades down to 2p . however ,",
    "the majority of these photons result in a cascade that ends in the 2s state instead , so these typically make a small contribution to the creation of injected ly@xmath0  photons compared to the ionizing photons ( see hirata 2006 ; pritchard & furlanetto 2006 ) .",
    "a fixed point in the intergalactic medium can be reached by continuum photons from stars out to a maximum redshift of @xmath18 .",
    "injected photons from ionization may come from a higher redshift , but they need to arise from x - rays which can penetrate over a large distance in the atomic medium .",
    "every x - ray can produce several secondary ionizations and collisional excitations by the electrons that are produced , and these will result in the production of a ly@xmath0  photon when the hydrogen atom reaches the 2p ( rather than the 2s ) state .",
    "these ly@xmath0  photons start scattering after they are produced , and they are confined to a very small region of the universe owing to the large cross section for ly@xmath0  scattering in the neutral medium .",
    "the flux of ly@xmath0  photons at any point in the atomic intergalactic medium is therefore related to the local flux of x - rays and continuum photons between the lyman series lines coming from distant stars , although some spatial diffusion of the ly@xmath0  photons may take place in the last few scatterings , when the photon exits the ly@xmath0  line @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature of 21-cm photons is given by @xmath19 the spin temperature @xmath20 is a weighted average of the cmb temperature and the gas kinetic temperature , and can be approximately calculated as ( see hirata 2006 for a more exact treatment ) @xmath21 where the coupling coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are proportional to the ly@xmath0  scattering rate @xcite and spin - changing collision rate , respectively : @xmath24 here , @xmath25k is the temperature corresponding to the energy of the hyperfine structure of hydrogen , @xmath26 is the einstein coefficient of the hyperfine structure levels , and @xmath27 is the collisional de - excitation rate ( tabulated first by @xcite , and more recently by @xcite ; in this paper we use the tabulated values given by @xcite ) .",
    "the spin - flip transition rate @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hubble rate at that redshift , @xmath31 is the gunn - peterson optical depth , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the intensities of continuum and injected ly@xmath0  photons , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are numerical factors of order unity that depend on the gas temperature and on @xmath31 ( see @xcite , @xmath36 , @xmath35,@xmath34 given in @xcite are all too large by a factor of @xmath37 , because of an incorrect normalization used in the original code ( this does not affect the basic conclusions reached in @xcite ) .",
    "we thank chris hirata for pointing out this error to us . also , loss of ly@xmath0  photons by the two photon decay process could further reduce the effective collision rate slightly , see @xcite for further information . ] ) . in the high temperature limit , @xmath38 . for simplicity ,",
    "in the present paper we shall assume @xmath39 , and use the value as given by the fitting formula of @xcite .",
    "the fiducial intensity @xmath40 corresponds to a photon density of one photon per hydrogen atom per log frequency , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number density of hydrogen and @xmath43 is the frequency of ly@xmath0  . in ordinary units , @xmath44 . at @xmath45 , @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "the ly@xmath0  sphere of a first star is the region where the spin temperature is substantially modified by the ly@xmath0  photon flux arriving from the star , producing an observable signature in the 21-cm line .",
    "stars that form later emit their ultraviolet light into a region that has already been previously illuminated by a background of light from more distant stars which formed earlier , and the contrast of the ly@xmath0  sphere from an individual star will of course rapidly diminish as the background intensity increases . in this paper , we designate as `` first star '' any star that emits the first light into the atomic medium that surrounds it .",
    "many more metal - free stars form later from pristine material ( i.e. , not contaminated by any stellar ejecta ) , but which has been illuminated by stellar light ; these stars create a ly@xmath0  sphere in the presence of a light background , with lower contrast . note that the region around a star is also modified by an increased kinetic temperature due to ionization by soft x - rays .    in this paper",
    "we assume that all the first stars are massive @xcite , with masses ranging from 25 @xmath48   to 800 @xmath48 . the main sequence lifetime of a massive , metal - free star is about three million years , and is generally much longer than the kelvin - helmholz time to reach the main - sequence . we treat the stars as static during their lifetime , with constant luminosity .",
    "as we shall see below , due to the @xmath49 decrease of the photon flux , the size of ly@xmath0  sphere is typically limited to a few tens of kpc , so the corresponding light propagation time is also negligible compared with the stellar lifetime .",
    "the scale of this ly@xmath0  sphere is much greater than the halo harboring the star , so we treat the density of the gas as uniform and equal to the cosmic mean ( note that this may be inaccurate in many cases because of the highly biased large - scale distribution of the first stars ) .",
    "the flux of the stellar continuum per unit frequency is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the physical distance to the star , and @xmath52 is the stellar luminosity per unit frequency .",
    "we model the stellar radiation as blackbody with surface temperature and total luminosity given by @xcite @xmath53      we now proceed to solve for the ionization fraction , kinetic temperature , spin temperature , and the 21-cm emission temperature around the star .",
    "we include recombinations in our calculation , but as the recombination time at the average density of the universe is a few times longer than the lifetime of the star and its associated ly@xmath0  sphere , it does not have a big impact on our result . note that we are also assuming that the high - density halo gas around the star ( which does not have time to be ejected from the halo during the stellar lifetime after it is ionized and heated ) does not absorb a large fraction of the stellar ionizing photons emitted by the central star @xcite",
    "we also do not consider ionization and heating by any x - ray background that may have been produced by sources other than the star .",
    "the neutral fraction is determined by @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the flux of ionizing photons per unit frequency , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the total number density of h and he atoms , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the fractional abundance , the cross section and the ionization threshold frequency of each atom or ion of type @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the case b recombination rates for hydrogen @xmath64 is calculated by using the fitting formula given in @xcite , the @xmath65 , @xmath66 are calculated by interpolating / extrapolating the tabulated values given in @xcite . in the helium ionization",
    ", we have neglected the contribution of direct double ionization , as this rate is small compared with ionization in two stages .",
    "we fit the cross sections using the functions given in @xcite .",
    "the flux at physical distance @xmath51 is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68    we assume @xmath69 , @xmath70 everywhere initially ( to include the primordial ionization ) .",
    "we then evolve the ion fractions on a lattice of 200 points ( logarithmically distributed from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) with the above differential equations .",
    "the solution of the ordinary differential equation is obtained with a predictor - corrector scheme @xcite .",
    "the internal energy of the gas is given by @xmath73 kt\\ ] ] the volume heating rate @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where the fraction of photo - electron energy converted to heat @xmath76 is a function of energy and free electron fraction .",
    "@xcite calculated this function using a monte carlo simulation , and found that it can be fitted as @xmath77 note that this fit breaks down at very low @xmath78 , but it is a good approximation for @xmath79 .",
    "also , this fitting function was obtained for non - primordial helium abundance , so the real result may differ slightly .    at large @xmath51 , where the ionized fraction in the ly@xmath0  sphere is low , cooling is negligible and we simply calculate the temperature using the above expressions for calculating the internal energy and the heating rate , assuming that there is no cooling .",
    "the effect of atomic cooling sets in rather abruptly once the temperature reaches @xmath80 k , and we assume that the temperature stays fixed at this value after it is reached .",
    "this does not affect our result on 21-cm because at these high temperatures the emission depends only on the hydrogen column density .",
    "owing to the high temperature of the metal - free stars , the soft x - rays from the stellar photosphere result in a substantial ionization and heating ahead of the thin shell where most of the ionization occurs .",
    "these high - energy electrons produced by the x - rays that penetrate into the mostly atomic zone also result in the emission of additional ly@xmath0  photons : in the limit of low fractional ionization and high photon energy , a fraction @xmath81 40% of the x - ray energy is converted to photons through excitation by the high - energy electrons . here",
    "we assume all of these are in ly@xmath0  photons .",
    "in reality , the fraction may be slightly smaller.the intensity of these ly@xmath0  photons is added to those coming from the stellar photosphere and can contribute to the coupling of the spin and kinetic temperatures .",
    "the ly@xmath0  photons produced through x - ray ionization are `` injected '' photons , since they are introduced at the resonance line center . spatial diffusion of these photons is negligible , because the width of the scattering line is much less than the hubble expansion velocity of the ly@xmath0  sphere at the radius where the emission of these photons is important . to evaluate their intensity",
    ", we note that each x - ray will produce a number of ly@xmath0  photons @xmath82 , and that each ly@xmath0  photon produced in this way will have its frequency redshifted at a rate @xmath83 if the effect of scatterings are neglected , where @xmath30 is the hubble constant .",
    "hence , the number density of these ly@xmath0  photons per unit of frequency should be equal to the heating rate per unit of volume ( eq .  15 ) times the factor @xmath84 .",
    "their intensity is therefore equal to @xmath85 in terms of the fiducial intensity in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we can rewrite this as @xmath86 noting that the quantity @xmath87 is roughly the heating rate required to heat the gas to a temperature @xmath88 k over a hubble time , we can easily see a relation between the temperature to which the gas is heated by x - rays and the ly@xmath0  intensity that can be produced from the same x - rays .",
    "for example , considering the gas temperature and ly@xmath0  intensity at half the lifetime of the star , @xmath89 , at a distant point in the ly@xmath0  sphere where the temperature has been heated due to x - ray absorption by @xmath90 k ( still allowing for a large 21-cm absorption signal ) , and using @xmath91 ( valid for high neutral fractions and x - ray energies ) , an intensity @xmath92 can be generated , sufficient to obtain @xmath93 for the spin - kinetic temperature coupling .",
    "we note here that the scattering of ly@xmath0  photons can also change the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "as shown by chen & miralda - escud ( 2004 ) , the heating rate due to the ly@xmath0  scattering is negligible compared to that caused by x - rays , and we do not include it here .",
    "in fact , for the regime that we shall be interested here , the temperature of the atomic medium is high enough that the scattering of ly@xmath0  photons actually causes _ cooling _ of the gas ( see fig .  3 in chen & miralda - escud 2004 ) , although by a negligible amount .",

    "the ly@xmath0  background originates from the continuum photons emitted by the stellar photospheres .",

    "hard x - ray photons may penetrate the ly@xmath0  sphere and produce some injected photons very far from the sources , but the total energy released in hard x - ray photons by the first stars is less than that in uv photons , and only a very small fraction of the hard x - ray photon is absorbed in the igm to produce injected ly@xmath0  photons . because the injected photons vastly dominate the intensity over the continuum photons from the central star , the background of ly@xmath0  photons is much fainter than it would be if continuum photons were the dominant ones .",
    "this allows for a lasting contrast of individual ly@xmath0  spheres in comparison to the background , because the ly@xmath0  background intensity stays low even when a very large number of first stars are seen from any random point in the universe .    at the same time , we need to take into account the background of x - rays produced by the stars and their global heating effect , which will raise the kinetic and spin temperatures and hence decrease the strength of the 21-cm absorption .    to compute the background of the continuum photons near the ly@xmath0  line , we assume a blackbody spectrum for the first stars .",
