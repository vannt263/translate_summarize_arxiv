    "long - range and quasi - long - range orders in strongly - correlated systems are the object of numerous theoretical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies . while it is fairly straightforward to ascertain the presence or absence of true long - range order @xcite , it is much harder to identify the dominant correlations from amongst several competing quasi - long - range orders in the quantum - mechanical ground - state wave function .",
    "much of this difficulty lies with the fact that few models that describe strongly - correlated systems can be solved analytically , and we have to resort to approximate or numerical methods to solve for the ground - state wave function . in particular , numerical solutions can only be obtained for a finite system , when our real interest is in the dominant quasi - long - range order of the infinite thermodynamic system . an obvious solution to this finite size problem would be to harness as much computational power as we can , to simulate extremely large systems @xcite .",
    "even so , our state - of - the - art simulations are still many orders of magnitude smaller than systems probed experimentally .",
    "alternatively , we can simulate systems of different sizes , and thereafter perform finite size scaling @xcite , to extrapolate the results to infinite system size .    in finite size",
    "scaling , the computational condensed matter community is essentially guided by general results from statistical mechanics @xcite , as well as exact solutions @xcite .",
    "however , finite size scaling is still very much an art , with no rigorous theorem proving that it will always work . besides the finite number of sites",
    ", our choice of boundary conditions might also affect the convergence properties of finite size scaling , and hence the reliability of our numerical solutions .",
    "in two recent studies , various quasi - long - range correlation functions were calculated using exact diagonalization @xcite and dmrg @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the power - law exponents obtained after finite size scaling do not agree with those derived from exact solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relative importance of finite system size and choice of boundary conditions , by comparing the power - law exponents of various correlation functions in a finite periodic and open chain of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion , against those of the infinite chain,@xcite as well as exponents of finite smooth chain obtained from the dmrg calculation @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sect : methods ] , we will describe how the ground state of finite periodic / open chain of particles with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion ( excluded chain ) can be mapped to the ground state of finite periodic / open chain of particles without nearest - neighbor repulsion ( included chain ) .",
    "based on this correspondence between ground states , we then explain how correlation functions in the excluded chain can be written in terms of corresponding correlation functions in the included chain , through an intervening - particle expansion .",
    "thereafter , we present in sec .  [",
    "sect : results ] our results for the two - point , density - density , and pair - pair correlation functions for finite excluded chains of hardcore bosons and spinless fermions .",
    "we fit these to different asymptotic combinations of simple and oscillatory power laws , to find generally good agreement between the amplitudes and exponents , and generally poor agreement between the phase shifts for finite and infinite chains .",
    "more importantly , we find for finite chains of the same intermediate lengths , reasonable agreement between our open - chain exponents and the finite - smooth - chain exponents in dmrg study . both show strong systematic differences with the finite - periodic - chain exponents . by repeating these exponent calculations for very long chains , we established that these differences at intermediate chain lengths to be due to the different choice of boundary conditions .",
    "these findings are then summarized in sec .",

[",
    "sect : interpartexp ] , we describe the intervening - particle expansion method , which allows us to write the ground - state expectation of a given excluded - chain observable , as a sum over conditional ground - state expectations of included chain observables .",
    "the excluded chain models for hardcore bosons and spinless fermions are given by the hamiltonians @xmath1 respectively , where @xmath2 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath3 is the nearest - neighbor repulsion , and @xmath4 is the on - site repulsion for hardcore bosons .",
    "exact solutions for these models can be obtained in the limit @xmath5 and @xmath6 , such that each site can only be singly occupied , and no adjacent sites can be simultaneously occupied .",
    "the excluded chains can be mapped to included chains of hardcore bosons and spinless fermions , with hamiltonians @xmath7 respectively , using a right - exclusion map first used by fendley to map a supersymmetric chain of spinless fermions to the @xmath8 chain @xcite . as shown in fig .",

    "mapping is one - to - one , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . for finite periodic chains ,",
    "the right - exclusion map is not one - to - one , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . nevertheless , it is possible to construct a one - to - one correspondence between the bloch states of the excluded chain and bloch states of the included chain .",

    "hardcore bosons or spinless fermions , the included - chain ground state can be ultimately written in terms of a one - dimensional fermi sea with discrete wave numbers .",
    "hence the ground - state expectations of all observables on the excluded chain can ultimately be expressed in terms of such fermi - sea expectations . in this subsection",
    ", we briefly describe how the correlations @xmath15 of two separated local operators of the excluded chain can be calculated using the method of _ intervening - particle expansion_.    first , for every observable @xmath16 on the excluded chain , we note that it is possible to define a _ corresponding observable",
    "_ @xmath17 on the included chain , such that @xmath18 for all excluded configurations @xmath19 and @xmath20 that are mapped to the included configurations @xmath21 and @xmath22 by the right - exclusion map .",

    "next , we expand the ground - state expectation @xmath24 as a sum over conditional ground - state expectations , where @xmath25 is a product of @xmath26 particle - occupation number operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 hole - occupation number operators @xmath29",
    ". we call this sum over all possible ways to insert particles between @xmath30 and @xmath31 the _ intervening - particle expansion_. finally , we rewrite each conditional ground - state expectation @xmath32 on the excluded chain in terms of their corresponding conditional ground - state expectation @xmath33 on the included chain . in terms of these conditional expectations , which can in turn be written in terms of expectations of the one - dimensional fermi sea , the intervening - particle expansion becomes @xmath34 which can always be evaluated numerically for separations @xmath35 that are not too large .",
    "in ref .  @xcite , three correlation functions : ( i ) the two - point function @xmath36 ; ( ii ) the density - density correlation function @xmath37 ; and ( iii ) the pair - pair correlation function @xmath38 were systematically examined for infinite chains of hardcore bosons and spinless fermions with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion , and also in three limiting cases for an infinite ladder . in this section , we calculate these three correlation functions for the finite periodic / open chain , for comparison against those of the infinite chain @xcite , as well as against those of finite smooth chain computed in the recent dmrg study @xcite . for the finite open chain ,",
    "we analyze the numerical correlation functions only for @xmath39 .",
    "we believe the results are not reliable for @xmath40 , because of phase separation in the finite open chain ground states ( the symptom of which can be seen in fig .",

    ", we also find an apparent convergence at a chain length of approximately @xmath64 .",
    "however , this ` limiting ' behaviour of @xmath46 does not agree with the exponent determined from the infinite chain , and is also systematically different from the ` limiting ' finite - smooth - chain exponent .",
    "in fact , unlike the infinite - chain and finite - smooth - chain exponents , the finite - periodic - chain exponent appears to be a strongly nonlinear function of @xmath75 .",
    "when we go to a @xmath65 periodic chain , the exponent @xmath46 is still strongly @xmath75-dependent .",
    "however , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : cdwfss ] that it is closer to the infinite - chain limit .    for finite open chains ,",
    "however , the chain - length - dependence of the exponent @xmath46 is rather different .",
    "starting from being close to the infinite - chain limit at @xmath60 , we see the exponent moving _ away _ from the infinite - chain limit as the chain length goes to @xmath76 to @xmath64 to @xmath77 to @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , there is an apparent convergence at @xmath64 to the finite - smooth - chain exponent .",
    "this suggests that a @xmath60 chain with smoothed open boundary conditions behaves like a longer chain with hard open boundary conditions , which is what they desired when white introduced the smoothed boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "what they , and dmrg group would not have guessed , is the finite open chain exponent deviating from the infinite chain exponent initially as we go to longer and longer chains .",
    "from the open chain results of @xmath65 and @xmath78 , we find that the convergence to infinite - chain results is slower than for finite periodic chains .    with this",
    ", we demonstrated that the choice of periodic / open boundary conditions resulted in the finite - chain exponents being systematically lower / higher than the infinite - chain exponent , for chain lengths on the order of @xmath60 to @xmath64 .",
    "this observation is important , because dmrg calculations on finite smooth chains are currently limited to such chain lengths .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the finite - chain exponents do converge onto the infinite - chain limit , but only when the chain length is on the order of @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , this convergence is not uniform for finite chains .",
    "this poses an important challenge for the use of finite size scaling to determine the infinite - chain limits .     for the density - density correlation function of hardcore particles with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion as a function of density @xmath55 , for different periodic chain lengths , @xmath79 ( red ) , @xmath60 ( blue ) , and @xmath64 ( black ) .",
    "the dashed line is the infinite - chain exponent from ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the dotted line is the best - fit straight line to the finite - smooth - chain exponent from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "finally , we compare the density - density correlation functions of different chain lengths , against the infinite - chain density - density correlation function , at density @xmath80 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdwfcfss ] , oscillatory power - law decay in the density - density correlation function is seen for finite and infinite chains .",
    "the finite periodic chain and infinite chain amplitudes are very similiar .",
    "the rates at which the density - density correlations decay on the finite periodic chain and infinite chain are also very similar .",
    "this explains the reasonable agreement seen in the fitted amplitudes and exponents .",
    "however , the phase shifts in the finite periodic chain and the infinite chain are rather different , and increasing the chain length from @xmath79 to @xmath60 to @xmath64 does not make the finite - chain phase shift approach the infinite - chain phase shift .",
    "this is true even at @xmath65 .",
    "as pointed out by the referee , this is expected as the phase shift is a parameter that is adjusted globally to minimize the effects of the boundaries , and thus will not converge smoothly with increasing chain length .",
    "more importantly , the amplitude of the oscillatory power law is very small for finite open chains , because of the spatial averaging performed .",
    "this same spatial averaging is done in the finite - smooth - chain calculations .    .",
    "the solid line is the infinite - chain exponent from ref .",
    "in conclusion , we employed the exact mapping between the ground states of the excluded chains and included chains of hardcore bosons and spinless fermions , along with the intervening - particle expansion method , both developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to investigate how the finite chain length and the choice of the boundary conditions manifest themselves in the two - point , density - density , and pairing correlation functions .",
    "we fitted these finite - chain correlations to the generic asymptotic form @xmath81 , and compared the fitted parameters to those obtained from an infinite chain , and a finite smooth chain .",
    "in general , we find reasonable agreement between fitted amplitudes and exponents for the finite and infinite chains , but poor agreement for the fitted phases .",
    "we also find the phase shifts depend on both boundary conditions and system length .",
    "comparing the finite - periodic - chain , finite - open - chain , finite - smooth - chain and infinite - chain exponents for correlation functions at the same length , we find that the finite - periodic - chain exponents are closer to the infinite - chain results and finite - open - chain exponents are closer to the finite - smooth - chain ones . we attribute this systematic difference to the finite size effects and the different choices of boundary conditions . in a nutshell ,",
    "finite - periodic - chain correlations are stronger than they are with open or smooth boundary conditions ( or any variants thereof ) .",
    "more importantly , we observed at intermediate chain lengths an apparent ` convergence ' of our finite - chain exponents to functions of the density @xmath55 different from the infinite - chain exponents .",
    "a straightforward finite size scaling may thus lead us to the wrong physics .",
    "this same phenomenon was observed in the dmrg study of finite smooth chain as well , suggesting in general that uniform convergence can not be expected for chain lengths of @xmath82 , and perhaps not even for chain lengths of @xmath83 .",
    "a more positive take on these general results would that that numerical studies using more than one set of boundary conditions offer us a better sense of how far we might be away from the infinite - system limits , even when there is no guarantee that the results from different boundary conditions will bound the true infinite - chain limit .",
