    "carbon stars , recognized by @xcite , are peculiar objects with their optical spectra characterized by strong carbon molecular bands , namely ch , cn , and @xmath0 , as well as sic@xmath3 and c@xmath4 in the cooler stars . compared to normal stars ,",
    "carbon stars show an inversion of the c / o ratio ( c / o@xmath5 ) .",
    "most carbon stars in the galaxy are dwarf carbon stars .",
    "both dwarf carbon stars and c - h  stars inherited their atmospheric carbon by mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) companion which is now a white dwarf .",
    "most such white dwarfs have already cooled sufficiently to be undetectable in spectroscopy . however , the inversion of the c / o ratio in the cool and luminous carbon stars ( c - n type ) is due to the currently undergoing third dredge - up in the agb phase .",
    "the origin of the enrichment of c - r  stars is still in debate , since long - term radial - velocity observations revealed that they seem not to be in binary systems @xcite , which leads to the conclusion that they are the product of a merger and mergers are known to produce fast rotators .",
    "theoretical works suggested that the merging of a he white dwarf with a red giant branch star is the most favorable progenitor , because a strong off - center he - flash led by rotation of the he - core formed after the merger is expected to provoke the mixing of carbon into the envelope @xcite .",
    "almost all the excess of carbon in carbon stars is produced through the triple-@xmath6 reaction during helium fusion in red giant stars .",
    "as the carbon - rich agb stars are very luminous and easily identified by their strong band heads in their spectra , they are usually used as kinematical and dynamical probes of the galaxy at large distance .",
    "for instance , carbon stars have been used to measure the velocity dispersions of the galactic halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the galactic rotation curve @xcite .",
    "the mean apparent magnitude of carbon stars has also been used to estimate the distance moduli of ngc205 and ngc300 @xcite .    up to now , a series of surveys have been conducted for searching the galactic carbon stars such as the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) survey @xcite , the first byurakan spectral sky survey @xcite and infrared objective - prism surveys ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite published a catalogue containing 6891 carbon stars , which is the revised version of the general catalogue of cool carbon stars maintained by b. c. stephenson of the warner and swasey observatory @xcite .",
    "carbon stars are mainly identified from the optical c@xmath3 swan bands , the near - infrared cn bands , and the 11.2@xmath7 m band of sic",
    ". they can be classified into several sub - types from the spectral features @xcite .",
    "c - r  stars often show strong continuum in blue , slightly enhanced ba , and strong isotopic c bands .",
    "c - n  stars show strong and diffuse blue absorption , enhanced ba lines , and weak isotopic c bands .",
    "c - h  stars have strong ch absorption and weak ca , fe lines @xcite . beside these , there are other sub - types such as c - j   ( strong @xmath2c/@xmath1c ratio ) and dc ( dwarf carbon ) stars .",
    "note that these classifications are not directly related to their origin .    among these spectral sub - types ,",
    "c - n  and c - h  stars are of more interest because the former are mostly in the agb stage and the later are found mostly from halo populations @xcite .",
    "increasing the samples for either types of carbon stars will be very helpful to improve our knowledge about how a star ends its life ( through c - n stars ) and the formation history of the stellar halo ( through c - h stars ) . based on the low - resolution spectra of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ;",
    "* ) , 39 and 251 faint ( r@xmath8 ) high - latitude carbon stars ( fhlcs ) were identified successively by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , @xcite retrieved 1220 fhlcs from sdss dr7 through cross correlation of stellar spectra with the sdss carbon star templates .",
    "@xcite found 202 new carbon stars using the label propagation algorithm from sdss dr8 .    from the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost )",
    "pilot survey @xcite , @xcite identified 158 new carbon stars using the manifold ranking algorithm . in a survey , the fraction of carbon stars that are dwarfs depends sensitively on the magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "the relatively brighter limiting magnitude ( @xmath9 ) for the lamost survey tends to find more giants and agb stars , whereas the sdss spectroscopy survey ( @xmath10 ) reveals many more dwarfs than giants ( nearly 70% ) .    in this paper , we identify more carbon stars from lamost dr2 , which contains almost 4 million stellar spectra , based on the spectral line indices .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section 2",
    ", we briefly introduce the basic data from lamost dr2 and give a detailed description of the method to search for carbon stars . in section 3",
    ", we show the results of the classification of the carbon stars . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize the distribution of different sub - types of carbon stars in line indices and multi - band photometric space .",
    "finally , a short conclusion is drawn in section 5 .",
    "the lamost , also called guo shou jing telescope , is a 4-meter reflective schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers on a 20-square degree focal plane @xcite .",
    "the unique design of lamost enables it to take 4000 spectra in a single exposure to a limiting magnitude as faint as @xmath1119 at the resolution r=1800 .",
    "the lamost survey will finally obtain more than 5 million low resolution stellar spectra after its 5-year survey @xcite .",
    "previous works have shown that lamost observations are biased more to the giant than the dwarf stars , since the limiting magnitude is relatively brighter @xcite . by the end of 2014 , the lamost team released the dr2 catalog , which contains 4136482 targets including 3784461 stars . in dr2 , there are about 0.5 million late type giant stars @xcite , implying that they should observe quite lots of carbon stars .",
    "typical spectra of carbon stars are characterized by strong c@xmath3 , cn , and ch absorption bands @xcite .",
    "therefore , we measure the line indices of carbon related molecular lines to identify carbon stars .",
    "we show several sample lamost spectra for typical carbon stars in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "the features of the c@xmath3 swan bands at 4737 , 5165 , 5635 , and red cn molecule bands at 7065 and 7820  are prominent in these spectra , while detailed features are different in different sub - types .",
    "compared to the traditional approach to classify the spectral types , using line indices allows a semi - automatic classification . with multiple spectral line indices ,",
    "various spectral types may transitionally change from one to another , which naturally reflect the variation of the astrophysical parameters , e.g. effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity , from type to type @xcite . in order to identify carbon stars ,",
    "we adapt the lick line indices defined by @xcite and @xcite . for the lamost dr2 spectra",
    ", we use the measured results from @xcite .",
    "the baii ( 4554 ) , molecular bands @xmath0  ( around 5635 ) , cn ( 7065 ) , and cn ( 7820 ) are also measured based on the wavelength definition listed in table  [ tab : lineindices ] .",
    "the line index in terms of equivalent width ( ew ) is defined by the following equation @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fluxes of spectral line and continuum , respectively , which are functions of wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "the pseudo - continuum @xmath14 is estimated via linear interpolation of the fluxes located in the `` shoulder '' region on either side of each index bandpass .",
    "the line index under this definition is in  . for the spectra with signal - to - noise ratio larger than 20 ,",
    "the typical uncertainty of the equivalent widths of the atomic lines is smaller than 0.1 , while for the molecular band it becomes a few  , and may be systematically affected due to difficulty in defining the continuum .",
    "we first select the stellar spectra with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) larger than @xmath16 in @xmath17 band from lamost dr2 , and obtain 2434289 stellar spectra in which only one epoch of the multiply observed objects is included .",
    "then we locate the distribution of the known carbon stars in cn7820  vs. cn7065  plane ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) , so that we can determine the intrinsic location of the carbon stars .",
    "there are 1093 stars marked as carbon stars in the lamost dr2 catalog .",
    "these marks are added from a template matching technique @xcite .",
    "the automatic pipeline may mistakenly identify normal stars or those with lower s / n as carbon stars .",
    "meanwhile , lots of the carbon spectra without a good match in their incomplete templates are missed .",
    "we inspect the stars with carbon marks by eye and finally confirm that 243 are real carbon stars with s / n@xmath18 in both @xmath19 and @xmath17 bands ( s / n(@xmath19 ) and s / n@xmath20 hereafter ) .",
    "moreover , we find 34 common carbon stars by cross - identifying lamost dr2 ( s / n@xmath18 in both @xmath19 and @xmath17 bands ) with the carbon star catalog provided by @xcite .",
    "it is seen that , in the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , the branch from the central region to the top - right corner is dominated by the carbon stars .",
    "we then adopt the following empirical criteria in the cn7820  vs. cn7065  plane so that most of the stars located in the branch toward top - right corner are included . with these cuts ,",
    "we obtain 87160 carbon star candidates .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23    in the central region around the origin point of our selected branch in figure  [ fig1 ] , different types of stars and low s / n spectra are mixed together .",
    "hence , for the high contaminated region , it is very hard to identify the carbon stars in the crowded region only from the cn features .",
    "it seems that low s / n spectra are prominent in the crowded region . to remove them ,",
    "we add additional cuts of s / n@xmath18 in @xmath19 and @xmath17 bands for the stars located in the bottom - left region defined by the two solid black lines indicated in the figure . with this new cut , 59371 of 87160 stars",
    "are removed and 27789 carbon candidates are left .",
    "we further map the candidate sample in the @xmath0  vs. cn7065  plane with the known carbon stars simultaneously cut with the same criteria in equations ( 2)@xmath24(4 ) , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we remove the stars with weak @xmath0  and cn7065  absorption features , i.e. @xmath0@xmath25 and cn7065@xmath26 .",
    "because the s / n is lower in the blue bands , in which most of the @xmath0  bands are located , it may be very difficult to identify @xmath0  bands from the noisy spectra and lead to larger uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we decide to use cn features instead of bluer @xmath0  features in this work . as a cost , some true carbon stars which have not cn features",
    "may also be removed after this cut .",
    "the new candidate sample ( green symbols in the plot ) includes 11254 stars .",
    "it is noted that the equivalent widths of @xmath0  have lots of negative values , which are due to the variation of the pseudo - continua affected by the other molecular bands .",
    "this systematics is very difficult to be removed for late type spectrum since the molecular bands make it impossible to find the real continuum .",
    "nevertheless , the systematic bias would not affect the identification of the carbon - rich features , because the relative values of @xmath0  is sufficient in the identification .",
    "these carbon star candidates are then mapped to the @xmath27  vs. @xmath28  plane in figure  [ fig : kjk ] . since 13 of these 11254 carbon star candidates",
    "have no @xmath29 and @xmath27  colors which were obtained , a total of 11241 candidates are shown in figure  [ fig : kjk ] .",
    "the known carbon stars are also overlapped in the same plot .",
    "the values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath27  are obtained by cross - identifying with the 2mass all - sky point source catalog @xcite . as the limiting @xmath27",
    "magnitude of 2mass survey is around 14.5mag , we refine the sample with @xmath27@xmath31mag so that the color index @xmath28  is sufficiently accurate for the carbon star identification . in figure",
    "[ fig : kjk ] , the stars brighter than @xmath27@xmath32mag can be divided into bluer and redder groups according to their @xmath28  color .",
    "most of the known carbon stars cover the redder group , which are dominated by the cool stars . with the cut of @xmath28@xmath33mag",
    ", we can well remove most of the warm star contaminators located in the bluer group ( marked as gray asterisks ) . from the cuts in the color - magnitude diagram ,",
    "6309 candidates are left .",
    "it is noted that some bluer carbon stars may not be included .",
    "g - type \" stars are thought as a kind of dc star , which show weak cn and relatively blue colors and are probably the most massive dcs still cool enough to show @xmath0bands .",
    "finally , we inspect the spectra for all 6309 stars by eye for confirmation .",
    "the cn , @xmath0 , ch , and tio@xmath3 features are used to judge whether the candidate spectra are real carbon stars .",
    "this procedure has been done at least twice by the same people and has been independently confirmed by other people to avoid severe bias of the judgment .",
    "the whole selection process for carbon stars is listed in table  [ tab : steps ] , and we finally identify 894 carbon stars , which are listed in table  [ tab : carbonstars ] .    figure  [ fig : tioc2 ] shows the normalized histograms of ew for c@xmath3 ( 5635 , left panel ) and tio@xmath3 ( 6191 , right panel ) for the 894 carbon stars , the remaining 5415 candidates , and the total 6309 candidates .",
    "it is noted that many of ( but not exclusively ) the visually - selected carbon stars are found in the region of strong @xmath0   ( @xmath34 ) and weak tio@xmath3 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , some unselected candidates are also located in the weak - tio@xmath3 , strong-@xmath0  region . they are double checked and confirmed that they are contaminators due to the noise in the spectra .",
    "some of the weak - tio@xmath3 stars also show strong @xmath0 , most of them are not carbon stars but their @xmath0  measures are affected by the local spikes in the spectra .",
    "we further map the carbon stars @xmath0  vs. ba4554 ) in figure  [ fig : bac2 ] and surprisingly find some carbon stars are located in a clump mostly occupied by the ejected o - rich stars .",
    "we select the clump with two straight - line cuts at @xmath0@xmath36 and baii ( 4554)=1.2 ( blue dashed lines shown in the plot ) and obtain 105 samples located in the clump .",
    "we double check these samples and find that they do show @xmath0  in their blue spectra and cn band in the red , which are very likely features of early type carbon stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : suspectc_spectra ] shows a few sample spectra selected from this group of stars . because in this work we do not directly measure c / o , which should be determined from the comparison with a set of proper model spectra , it is not clear whether the c / o ratio is larger than 1 for these stars .",
    "therefore , we mark them in the table  [ tab : carbonstars ] with a question flag and denote them as the _ suspected carbon stars s in the rest of the paper_. alternatively , these stars may be the so called strong - cn stars @xcite .",
    "more investigation for these stars should be done in future work .",
    "according to the revised mk carbon - star classification system of @xcite , there are five types of carbon stars , i.e. , c - r  stars , c - n  stars ( roughly corresponding to the harvard r and n stars ) , c - j  stars , c - h  ( or ch ) stars , and c - hd ( hydrogen deficient ) carbon stars . here , we mainly focus on the types of c - r , c - n , and c - h .",
    "c - n  stars can be easily distinguished from other types because of the strong absorption in the blue part of the spectra  ( generally little or no flux bluer than 4400  according to * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , c - h  stars are difficult to be distinguished from c - r  stars . in general , c - h  stars are more metal poor and most of them are recognized as high - velocity halo objects . however , there are still some indicators which can be used to distinguish c - h  stars from c - r  stars based on the low - resolution spectra , such as 1 ) c - h  stars show quite a strong g band ; 2 ) they have an exceptionally strong p - branch head near 4342 ; 3 ) they show weaker cai at 4227 ; 4 ) they show enhanced lines of s - process elements ( e.g. , baii lines at 4554 , 5853 and 6496 ) and weaker fe - group elements @xcite .    according to the low - resolution lamost spectra",
    ", we select a set of the most prominent criteria , which are summarized in table  [ tab3 ] , to classify the sub - types of the carbon stars .",
    "since we do not use any quantified approach in the procedure , misclassification may occur for a few carbon stars with insignificant features , especially for those in between c - r  and c - h .",
    "applying the criteria listed in table  [ tab3 ] , we find 108 c - n , 259 c - r , 339 c - h , and 83 unknown stars .",
    "the sub - type for each carbon star is listed in table  [ tab : carbonstars ] .",
    "after manually classifing the carbon stars , we reveal more features of the sub - types in their spectral and photometric data . on one hand , these features will be very helpful to better understand the physics of these stars ; on the other hand , they can provide some hints for improving the approaches to the sub - classification .",
    "in next two sub - sections , we discuss the features for the c - n  stars and c - r / c - h  stars , respectively .      among the three sub - types discussed in this work ,",
    "c - n  stars are the easiest one to be classified from the spectra , since they show very weak fluxes in blue wavelengths .",
    "hence we develop a color index , denoted as f4600/f8000 , by dividing the median flux between 4300 and 4600  by the value between 8000 and 8700 .",
    "we do not use fluxes bluer than 4300  because they are more affected by noise .",
    "figure  [ fig : c2_blueflux ] shows that most of the c - n  stars are located in the left side with very low flux in blue wavelength .",
    "it also displays that the equivalent width of @xmath0  is slightly anti - correlated with f4600/f8000 , implying that the c - n  stars with stronger swan bands have lower flux in the blue end .",
    "this trend can be naturally explained by the effective temperature .",
    "the lower effective temperature , the stronger the molecular bands and the lower luminosity in blue band .",
    "lots of previous work has demonstrated that the infrared photometry is very helpful to identify the c - n  stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccdiagram ] shows that the c - n  stars are concentrated in the red end of the stellar locus in @xmath37  vs. @xmath28  diagram , specifically redder than the boundary defined by @xmath28@xmath38 , @xmath28@xmath39 , and @xmath37@xmath40(@xmath28)@xmath41 .",
    "figures  [ fig : c2_blueflux ] and  [ fig : ccdiagram ] provide two different means to identify c - n  stars . based on our sample , for the low resolution spectroscopic data , if we classify the c - n  as those bluer than @xmath42 , the completeness of this simplified criterion can reach 100% with 16% contamination . for the photometric data ,",
    "if we apply the criteria of @xmath28@xmath38 , @xmath28@xmath39 , and @xmath37@xmath40(@xmath28)@xmath41 , we can identify 73% from the full sample of the c - n  stars with a contamination rate of 8% .",
    "we show the distributions for the c - r  and c - h  stars in the baii ( 4554)-fe - cai ( 4227@xmath43 ) space in figure  [ fig : metal ] .",
    "it is seen that , although on average the c - r  are more metal - rich than the c - h  stars , no clear boundary is found between the two classes .",
    "the suspected carbon stars ( gray unfilled asterisks ) are also drawn in the figure .",
    "the left panel shows that most of the c - h  stars have similar ba but lower ca compared with the c - r  stars .",
    "the right panel shows that the equivalent width of ba for both c - r  and c - h  stars are well correlated with fe , while the suspected carbon stars are isolatedly located above the c - r  and c - h  stars with larger fe .",
    "it is not easy to directly estimate whether the c - h  stars are more ba - rich than the c - r  stars simply from the line indices , because the line indices are not only affected by the abundance but also correlated with effective temperature , surface gravity log@xmath19 , and overall metallicity .",
    "therefore , we use the lines indices ratio ba4554/(4+ca4227 ) as the indicator of the [ ba / fe ] , since the ca line can be approximately treated as a proxy of the metallicity without being sensitively affected by the effective temperature .",
    "however , the fe lines are more sensitive to the effective temperature and hence can not be directly used as a proxy of the metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_baca ] shows that , although they are quite similar , the ba abundance for the c - h  stars is statistically larger than that for the c - r  stars .    in figure  [ fig : hbeta_fe5015 ] , the c - r  and c - h  stars are compared with the normal k giant stars in effective temperature and metallicity via two line indices : @xmath44 , which is sensitive to the effective temperature , and fe ( 5015 ) , which is sensitive to the metallicity @xcite .",
    "we find that the c - r  are more metal - rich and slightly cooler than c - h  stars .",
    "interestingly , the suspected carbon stars ( the gray unfilled asterisks ) are mostly supersolar metal - rich stars",
    ".    the c - h  stars are believed to be in binary systems , in which the companions have evolved to white dwarfs and mass transferring may be responsible for the enrichment of the carbon at the surface of the c - h  stars .",
    "the origin of the c - r  stars , especially the early type c - r  stars , is still not quite clear .",
    "it seems that they are not post - agb stars due to the lower luminosity and some observational evidence shows that they are also not mass transfer binaries @xcite . although @xcite suggested that the c - r  stars may have been coalesced , @xcite thought no additional rotation signature is found from the width of the spectral lines for the sample of mcclure .",
    "theoretical works suggested that a merger of a helium white dwarf to a red giant branch star can shift the helium - flash to the outskirt of the core allowing more carbon elements to mix in the convective envelope @xcite , while another scenario of red giant mergers may not create a peculiar helium - flash and additional carbon at surface @xcite . the larger ba abundance of c - h  stars is likely due to mass transfer from an agb companion .",
    "the smaller ba for c - r  stars is consistent with the hypothesis that they should not be polluted by an agb companion .",
    "figure  [ fig : ks ] shows histograms of magnitude @xmath27 for dc , c - h ,",
    "c - r  and c - n  stars .",
    "it can be seen that the c - n  stars are brightest , then c - r , c - h , and dcs the last , which is expected .",
    "since c - n  stars are n - type agb stars with high luminosity , they show very bright @xmath27 magnitude .",
    "dcs are dwarf stars with the lowest luminosity , thus they concentrate in the faintest end .",
    "most of c - r  and c - h  stars are giants , thus have moderate distributions of magnitude .",
    "the identification for dcs is discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : spatial ] shows the spatial distribution for the identified carbon stars in galactic coordinates .",
    "as expected , the c - n  stars are quite concentrated in the disk mid - plane , while the c - h  stars are mostly distributed in the high galactic latitude region .",
    "the c - r  stars are in the middle , most of them are concentrated at low galactic latitudes but a few are located at high latitudes .",
    "previous works showed that many of the carbon stars are actually the carbon dwarf stars .",
    "however , it seems very difficult to distinguish dwarf stars from the spectral features .",
    "hence , we identify the possible dwarf stars from the reduced proper motion .",
    "the reduced proper motion is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the reduced proper motion , @xmath27  is the @xmath47-band photometry from the 2mass catalog , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the proper motion in mili - arcsecond per year from the ppmxl catalog @xcite . because most of the stars in the milky way have relatively similar motion speed , then the transversal angular velocity , i.e. the proper motion , is generally larger ( smaller ) when the star is nearer ( farther ) to the sun .",
    "consequently , the proper motion can be very roughly considered as the proxy of the parallax and thus @xmath46 can be roughly treated as the absolute magnitude of a star according to equation ( [ eq : redpm ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : redpm ] shows @xmath46 vs. @xmath28  for the carbon stars as well as the distributions for the normal k giant stars ( defined as log@xmath19@xmath50 and displayed as the red contours ) and k dwarf stars ( defined as log@xmath19@xmath51 and displayed as the green dashed contours ) selected from the lamost dr2 catalog .",
    "the two distributions for the normal k giant and dwarf stars can be used as the probability density functions for the two luminosity types in the plane and the middle points between the two probability density functions are indicated by the solid thick green line , which can be used as the separation line for the giant / dwarf stars .",
    "the stars located above the line are very likely giant stars and the stars located below are likely dwarf stars . applying this empirical giant / dwarf separation line to the 894 carbon stars , we find 84 possible carbon dwarf stars , 53 of them are c - h  stars and 22 of them are c - r  stars . none of the possible dwarf stars are classified as the c - n  or suspected carbon stars .",
    "we investigate the 243 confirmed carbon stars with _ carbon _ flag in the lamost catalog .",
    "where 219 of them are left after the cuts in cn7820 , cn7065 , @xmath0 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "when we inspect the spectra for the 6309 candidates we do not check the _ carbon _ flag . but finally , all of the 219 confirmed lamost carbon stars are again identified as the carbon stars and show up in the final catalog .",
    "this confirm that the inspection of the spectra is quite stable and reliable .    in this work ,",
    "we combine the manual inspection of the spectra with the cuts in the line index space and color - magnitude diagram , and successfully identify 894 carbon stars from the lamost dr2 catalog .",
    "these 105 of the suspected samples have weak @xmath0  band with weak tio@xmath3 band , which is not a typical feature of carbon stars .",
    "however , to keep the catalog complete , we leave them in the final catalog with a mark of type _ c?_. the largest fraction of the stars , i.e. 339 of 894 , are classified as the c - h  stars , which are ba enhanced and more metal - poor .",
    "there 259 of the carbon stars are classified as the c - r  stars and 108 are c - n  stars .",
    "we suggest to use f4600/f8000 the median flux ratio of the blue ( 4300@xmath244600 ) and red ( 8000@xmath248700 ) to select the c - n  stars with completeness of 100% and contamination rate of only 16% .",
    "we demonstrate that although the 2mass photometry is able to identify c - n  stars with reasonably low contamination , it may have relatively lower completeness .",
    "it is very interesting to do follow - up time - domain photometric and high - resolution spectroscopic observations in the future in order to identify carbon stars and further investigate their nature .",

    "<S> in this work , we present the new catalog of carbon stars from the lamost dr2 catalog . in total , 894 carbon stars are identified from multiple line indices measured from the stellar spectra . combining the cn bands in the red end with @xmath0  and other lines , we are able to identify the carbon stars . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we also classify the carbon stars into spectral sub - types of c - h , c - r , and c - n . </S>",
    "<S> these sub - types approximately show distinct features in the multi - dimensional line indices , implying that in the future we can use them to identify carbon stars from larger spectroscopic datasets . meanwhile , from the line indices space , while the c - n  stars are clearly separated from the others , we find no clear separation between c - r  and c - h  sub - types . </S>",
    "<S> the c - r  and c - h  stars seem to smoothly transition from one to another . </S>",
    "<S> this may hint that the c - r  and c - h  stars may not be different in their origins but look different in their spectra because of different metallicity . due to the relatively low spectral resolution and lower signal - to - noise ratio , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of @xmath1c/@xmath2c is not measured and thus the c - j  stars are not identified . </S>"
