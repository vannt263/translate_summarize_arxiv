    "the whirlpool galaxy m51 at 9.6 mpc ( sandage and tammann 1975 ) is one of the closest grand design spirals , rich in molecular gas , much of which is found in the spectacular spiral arms ( e.g. young and scoville 1983 , rydbeck  1985 , lord and young 1990 ) .",
    "the striking spiral pattern of m51 has stimulated many observational studies .",
    "single dish co studies of the molecular cloud distribution have been undertaken by young and scoville ( 1983 ) , rydbeck  ( 1985 ) , lord and young ( 1990 ) , garca - burillo  ( 1993ab ) and nakai  ( 1994 ) .",
    "higher resolution aperture synthesis studies of the molecular spiral arms have been done by vogel , kulkarni and scoville ( 1988 ) , rand and kulkarni ( 1990 ) , tosaki  ( 1991 ) , adler  ( 1992 ) and rand ( 1993a ) .",
    "strong kinematic signatures of density waves are velocity discontinuities , or streaming motions , across the spiral arms ( e.g. roberts and stewart 1987 ) . the unusually large streaming motions ( 60 - 150 ) of m51 imply a very strong density wave .",
    "the high resolution studies resolve massive cloud complexes , termed giant molecular associations ( gmas ) by vogel , kulkarni and scoville ( 1988 ) along the main spiral arms and have also found a few apparently isolated complexes in the interarm region ( e.g. rand and kulkarni 1990 ; adler 1992 ; rand 1993a ) .",
    "possible differences in properties between arm and inter - arm gmas have been discussed ( rand 1993ab ) with the conclusion that the arm - gmas are probably gravitationally bound objects while the interarm gmas are probably unbound .",
    "it is still unclear , however , how density waves may affect the stability of the gas in the arms in detail .",
    "high resolution studies of streaming motions within , and in between , gmas have been lacking and it has been assumed that streaming does not change along the arm . the idea that arms are relatively shear - free environments where the streaming motions help cloud formation has been widely accepted .",
    "spiral arms are more readily studied in gas , compared to stars ( e.g. lubow  1986 ; lubow 1993 ) .",
    "sensitive co observations may therefore lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind spiral structure . determining the location of resonances is particularly important since it helps distinguish between various theories of spiral structure .",
    "for instance , theories differ on whether spiral structure can extend beyond the 4/1 ultraharmonic resonance on the outside ( e.g. contopoulos and grosb@xmath5l 1986 ; artymowicz and lubow 1992 ) , and whether it terminates before reaching the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) on the inside ( e.g. lubow 1993 ) .    in this first paper",
    "we will focus the discussion on streaming motions and spiral structure .",
    "newly discovered structure in the streaming motions on the main arms and the implications for gma formation and survival are discussed in section ( 4.1 - 4.3 ) .",
    "the location of the 4/1 resonance and its possible relation to structures in the interarm emission is discussed in section ( 4.4 ) .",
    "evidence for a molecular spiral in the inner kpc is presented in section ( 4.5 ) together with gas on non - circular orbits as indications of a central bar .",
    "adopted properties of m51 are listed in table 1 .    in paper ii we will focus on the smaller scale structure of the molecular gas .",
    "in particular , the boundedness of clouds and possible differences between on - arm , interarm and central region gas will be investigated , also in relation to tracers like h@xmath6 and infrared .",
    "aperture synthesis co mapping of m51 was carried out with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array between october 1995 and may 1996 .",
    "sis receivers of the six 10.4 m telecopes of the array provided typical system temperatures of 500 k. the quasars 1150 + 497 and 0917 + 449 were used for phase calibration , and uranus and neptune for absolute flux calibration .",
    "synthesized beams are @xmath7 ( pa=-81@xmath8 ) for robust ( briggs ( 1995 ) ) weighting , and @xmath9 ( pa=-43@xmath8 ) for natural weighting",
    ".    natural weighting , with all points covered in the uv - plane treated alike , emphasizes shorter spacings , since the uv - tracks are more densely packed close to the origin .",
    "it gives the best signal - to - noise ratio , but at the cost of poorer beam shape .",
    "uniform weighting assigns identical weight to given cells in the uv - plane , thus maximizing the resolution at the cost of sensitivity ( e.g. sramek and schwab , 1989 ) .",
    "because of the limited uv - coverage common to mm interferometry , especially in mosaicing mode , this weighting scheme often yields poor results . robust weighting , which we applied instead to produce our most highly resolved images , improves the signal - to - noise ratio over uniform weighting while still giving higher resolution than naturally weighted maps .    at wavelength",
    "@xmath10 mm and resolution @xmath11 , a brightness temperature of @xmath12 k corresponds to 67 mjy beam@xmath13 .",
    "the digital correlator was centered at @xmath14 , and provided a total velocity coverage of 333 , from 351  to 601 .",
    "data were binned at a resolution of 3 mhz , corresponding to a spectral resolution of 7.8 .",
    "we observed a total of 19 positions ( listed in table 2 ) in three different array configurations ( compact , low resolution , high resolution )  the shortest baseline was 15 m and the longest 240 m .",
    "the largest structure we could therefore image was 18@xmath2 .",
    "the primary beam is 65@xmath2 ( fwhm ) and the grid spacing of the 19 positions was 30@xmath2 , chosen to give approximately constant noise across the map .",
    "we took 10 12-hr tracks per configuration for a total of 360 hours of telescope time .",
    "the observing scheme was designed to minimize calibration inconsistencies within the final map : all positions were observed sequentially , with only 2 minutes spent on each field at a time .",
    "thus , each of the 19 positions was observed 10 - 15 times during each track , giving a very homogeneous final data set .",
    "individual maps were made and deconvolved with the nrao aips and the caltech difmap ( shepherd  1995 ) software packages .",
    "the aips ltess task , a mosaicing procedure that corrects for primary beam attenuation , was used to combine all 19 positions into a single datacube .",
    "the rms noise is 19 mjy per channel ( 0.2 k ) throughout the whole naturally weighted map ( apart from the outer @xmath15 3@xmath2 before cutoff , where the noise reaches 35 mjy per channel ) .",
    "figure 1a shows the naturally weighted integrated intensity map with @xmath16 resolution . the molecular spiral arms appear with great clarity , and previously unknown structures on , and between , the main arms are revealed .",
    "a comparison with optical pictures shows that the main co arms trace the dust lanes beautifully .",
    "the map is dominated by two main spiral arms of which the sw ( m1 ) arm is the brightest , its flux being greater by a factor of two than that of the ne arm ( m2 ) .",
    "the m1 arm is also broader than the m2 arm by @xmath350% .",
    "the co emission originates mostly from large cloud complexes ( giant molecular associations , gmas ) .",
    "the brightest ( @xmath17 k ) gma on the m1 arm has a fwhm size of 11@xmath2 by 6@xmath2 ( 512 by 280 pc ) and sits on a ridge of co emission 20@xmath18 in size . along the sw m1 arm",
    "we count 16 gmas , with sizes varying from 6@xmath19 to 14@xmath20 .",
    "local , distinct peaks in the intensity distribution were counted as gmas .",
    "sizes for these peaks were determined using the aips imfit routine .",
    "extended emission associated with a peak ( at a level 20% or less of the peak ) was not counted .",
    "the real number of gmas in m1 is thus likely larger than 16 .",
    "a more thorough analysis of the size and structure of the cloud associations will be given in paper ii .",
    "clouds previously studied by rand ( 1993 ) ( a4 , a8 and a9 ) belong to the sw m1 arm and are indicated in figure 1a .",
    "the first gaps in intensity along the main arms occur symmetrically for both at a radius of 55@xmath2 where , as figure 1a shows , the arms first cross the major axis .",
    "the ne spiral arm m2 can be traced inwards to a galactocentric radius of 28@xmath2 ( 1.3 kpc ) , where the co contours and the associated optical dust lane make a sharp turn eastward and the chain of gmas ends .",
    "the first bright gma on the sw m1 arm appears at a radius of about 22@xmath2 ( 1.0 kpc ) where its lowest contours bend eastward towards the nucleus . at lower radii",
    "the cloud associations become poorly defined and fainter .",
    "feature c ( in figure 1a ) is a somewhat peculiar structure , a broad expansion perpendicular to the molecular arm southeast of the center .",
    "there is a similar , but less spectacular , feature on the western side of the nucleus .",
    "comparison of an optical image of m51 with our co map shows that the pattern of dust lanes spreads in a similar fashion to the co emission , and that inside the c region the dust lane structure is disordered .",
    "feature c occurs right after the ending of the main m2 arm at the claimed position of the ilr ( tully 1974b ) .",
    "we detect hints of molecular spurs , the features s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 in figure 1a , protruding at an angle ( 45@xmath8 - 90@xmath8 ) from the main spiral arms mostly on the western side of the galaxy .    a fairly recently discovered feature in m51 , also apparent in our map ,",
    "is the compact molecular gas concentration at the nucleus of the galaxy , first detected in hcn by kuno  and mapped at a higher resolution of 1@xmath2 in co 21 by scoville  ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is evidence in the present study of bifurcations in the molecular spiral arm structure  possibly as a result of the 4/1 ultraharmonic resonance caused by the spiral potential ( e.g. shu , milione and roberts ( 1973 ) ; artymowicz and lubow 1992 ( al ) ) .",
    "two faint chains of molecular clouds , b1 and b2 split off from the main spiral arms at a radius of roughly 3.3 kpc ( 71@xmath2 ) .",
    "structures previously classified as discrete interarm clouds ( i1,i2 in rand 1993a ) are part of the b1 chain of clouds .      the constant offset between the main arm m1 and the secondary arm b1 raises the concern that b1 is spurious , a sidelobe artifact of m1 , possibly the result of incomplete cleaning or miscalibration .",
    "s. vogel ( private communication ) raised this possibility because a new co map of m51 made with the bima array does not show b1 , but when he simulated observations of the bima map using some ( but not all of the ovro configurations ) , an arm - like feature appeared that is similar to if not identical to b1 . in view of this possibility",
    ", we carefully reexamined evidence for and against the reality of the b1 arm .",
    "we conclude that it is probably real for the following reasons :    \\i ) the brighter emission peaks along b1 are clearly evident in iram and oso single dish co maps ( e.g. garcia burillo  1993a ( fig 1 ) , rydbeck  1991 ) .",
    "the hi map by rots  ( 1990 ) shows structure that is coincident with b1 . a number of faint h@xmath6 emission regions are also seen along b1 ( vogel  1993 ) .",
    "\\ii ) a radial position - velocity cut through m1 and b1 reveals that although there is some overlap of the velocity ranges of emission between m1 and b1 , the peak velocity of b1 is redshifted by 20  relative to m1 .",
    "the velocity width of b1 is also narrower by a factor of two ( see figure 1c ) .",
    "it is significant too that , on the assumption of a flat rotation curve , b1 is at the expected velocity for its radius .",
    "lastly , we note that the streaming velocity structure from the main arm to the bifurcated material is continuous at the beginning of b1 .",
    "\\iii ) the new bima m51 co map ( helfer  1999 , in preparation ) does in fact show several low signal - to - noise features near the peaks in b1 .",
    "since the bima map is of lower sensitivity and resolution than ours , we think that the two data sets may not be inconsistent .",
    "\\iv ) while vogel s simulation of the ovro map does produce false arms , these do not agree very well in structure and position with our respective arms b1 and b2 .",
    "the b1 feature in the simulation is shifted 5 - 10@xmath2 inward from our b1 , and is straight , not curved .",
    "this last argument is of course not conclusive , since the simulation did not include the ovro compact configuration ( which probably would reduce the spurious features ) but in any case , if the residual sidelobes were the result of miscalibration , the simulation would never exactly reproduce the artifacts .",
    "\\v ) the secondary structures survive deep cleaning , with various approaches such as varying gain and number of iterations , as well as the position and number of cleaning boxes .",
    "they are also visible in a robustly weighted map , where the sidelobes are less prominent .",
    "the b features are also apparent in a map not biased toward positive emission .",
    "\\vi ) the b1 feature is well inside the primary beam half power points ( see table 2 for pointing positions ) which means that it is not an edge effect of the map .",
    "the outer cutoff of the naturally weighted map ( the outer dotted line in figure 1a ) is somewhat ( about 5@xmath2 ) inside the half power points of the outer pointings to show a map with ( almost ) constant noise .",
    "note that the outer sensitivity cutoff of the robustly weighted map ( figure 1b ) occurs at lower radius than for the naturally weighted one .",
    "lastly , we note that the possibility that the b features are aliasing effects is excluded because the size of the fft was four times the map size .    between b1 and the bright m1 arm ,",
    "there is a shorter chain of interarm clouds ( feature d , indicated by a dotted line in fig . 1a ) .",
    "these features also appear to be real structures for the same reasons as above .",
    "the total integrated flux in the whole ovro map is @xmath21 jy .",
    "we have used the oso 20 m single dish map of rydbeck  ( 1985 ) to compare the total co emission with that observed here interferometically . inside a radius of 30@xmath2",
    "the flux recovered by the ovro array is 810 jy while the oso single dish finds 1600 jy . inside a radius of 60@xmath2",
    "the ovro flux is 1700 jy  and the corresponding value for oso is 2800 jy , so that the ovro array recovers 50 - 60 % of the oso single dish flux in the region studied . comparing our map with the nro single dish map of kuno  ( 1995 )",
    ", we recover 30% of their single dish flux in the inner 25@xmath2 .",
    "one large error source is thus the relative calibration among telescopes , with oso and nro obviously differing by almost a factor of two .",
    "adler  ( 1992 ) claim to recover 50% of the total oso single dish flux in their bima aperture synthesis co map .",
    "figure 2a shows the brightness of each radial bin , the ovro mean radial co distribution from the naturally weighted map .",
    "for the adopted , radially independent conversion factor ( see table 1 ) between co luminosity and h@xmath22 mass , this figure shows the change in the mean gas surface density with radius .",
    "the gas surface density increases steeply beyond a radius of roughly 8@xmath2 and reaches a maxium ( 166 m@xmath23 pc@xmath24 ) at a radius of 28@xmath2 ( 1.3 kpc ) which is that of the bright peak in the sw arm .",
    "there is then a sharp drop to a minimum at @xmath25 ( 2.4 kpc ) , reflecting the first intensity gap in the main spiral arms .",
    "the brightness then increases somewhat again , and after 90@xmath2 it falls off steeply to the edge of the map at 95@xmath2 . from 28@xmath2 to 70@xmath2 , the average gas surface density drops by a factor of three .",
    "kuno  ( 1995 ) , from the nro single dish map , find a drop by a factor of @xmath34 in the same interval , but their radial curve is less sharply peaked , either because of their poorer resolution , or because the flux undetected at ovro is more smoothly distributed .",
    "the single - dish gas surface density overall may drop somewhat faster with radius than that detected here , so it is possible that the interferometer recovers a larger fraction of the single - dish flux with increasing radius  consistent with an increasing arm - to - interarm ratio with radius .",
    "figure 2b shows the variations of the co intensity along the two major arms .",
    "the resolution has been smeared to 10@xmath2 .",
    "the clumpy nature of the arms is evident , as well as there being a striking regularity of the distance , some 30@xmath2 - 40@xmath2 , between the major concentrations of gas along the arms .",
    "these peaks even occur at ( roughly ) the same spiral phase on both arms .",
    "these symmetries were also noted by garca - burillo  1993a .",
    "a similar effect in the optical was found by elmegreen , elmegreen and seiden ( 1989 ) who interpreted it as an intrinsic part of the stellar wave pattern .",
    "the robustly weighted map ( figure 1b ) recovers about 73% of the flux of the naturally weighted map in the same region , and much of the faint interarm structure is lost , although the brighter parts of the b1 and b2 features are present .",
    "the main arms are ( not surprisingly ) narrower in this map and the spurs are not as clearly visible . in the inner arcminute ,",
    "less flux is lost ( the map recovers about 85% of the naturally weighted flux ) and structures that could be narrow spiral arms can be discerned .      because of the high sensitivity , high resolution and improved uv coverage in our map , we find structures undetected by previous studies .",
    "these structures include most of the spurs , the c feature , parts of the b and d features , and the narrow molecular arms in the inner arcminute .",
    "our maps in general agree well with those obtained at ovro by rand and kulkarni ( 1990 , rk ) at 8@xmath2 resolution .",
    "there are hints in their data of the s1 spur and the b2 bifurcation ; the positions of gmas and emission gaps also agree with ours .",
    "there is some disagreement between the rk map and ours in the intensity distribution across the map ; the sw arm is too faint in their map and rand ( 1993 , r93 ) also points out that that part of their map is suspect owing to calibration errors .",
    "r93 mapped two overlapping 1@xmath26 fields that cover part of the m1 arm , and some interarm emission , with the ovro array at @xmath16 resolution ; his arm structure and cloud positions agree well with ours , although he misses much structure which we see ( e.g. the a10 cloud ) owing to his poorer uv coverage .",
    "rand found two interarm emission features ( i1 and i2 in r93 ) that we assign to the b1 cloud chain .",
    "adler  ( 1992 ) presented observations of m51 obtained with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometer ; they observed two @xmath27 fields with a synthesized beam of @xmath28 .",
    "since their shortest baseline ( 8 m ) was about half of ours , they were sensitive to larger structures . given the much larger synthesised beam of the adler  map , the qualitative agreement between their map and ours is as good as can be expected .",
    "the naturally weighted velocity field is shown in figure 3 [ plate 1 ] .",
    "velocities range from 350 ( deep blue ) to 550 ( red ) , with the gas approaching us in the northern part of the galaxy and receding in the south .",
    "streaming motions appear very clearly in the velocity field as jumps and discontinuities in the contours across spiral arms , in particular along the sw main arm , m1 .",
    "radial streaming motions , best seen along the minor axis , are prominent in the m1 arm ( west ) while none are readily apparent in the east .",
    "streaming motions along the major axis are more symmetrical with respect to the m1 and m2 arms .    because of the significantly increased resolution of the robustly weighted map ,",
    "streaming motions on the main arms are better resolved than in the naturally weighted map , in particular where the m1 arm crosses the major axis .",
    "sections of the robustly weighted velocity field are displayed in figures 6a and 6b .",
    "the velocity contours associated with the c feature are somewhat twisted , indicating a complex velocity field in this region .",
    "spurs s1 and s4 show velocity reversals as they stretch out into the interarm region , s2 and s3 show strong velocity gradients but no reversals , while s5 shows no velocity structure at all . along s4 the velocity shifts from 500 to 540  and then back to 500  as we move into the arm . within s1",
    "the shift is from 400  to 450  and then back again .",
    "the red feature in the center of the map is the small rotating nuclear gas disk which , as previously noted by scoville  ( 1997 ) , is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity by @xmath29 .",
    "the naturally weighted dispersion map is shown in figure 4 [ plate 2 ] .",
    "the map shows the one dimensional dispersion ranging from @xmath30 . only one value of @xmath31 is fit , even if the spectrum in question consists of multiple peaks .",
    "the red regions in the map indicate high dispersion , @xmath32 .",
    "most of the high @xmath31 structures may be caused by unresolved streaming motions ( e.g. where the western minor axis cuts the m1 and b1 arms ) .",
    "positions of strong streaming motions , indicated in the velocity field , do indeed correlate with regions of high dispersion .",
    "other regions of disturbed velocity contours , such as the c region , and the bifurcation areas also show spots of high dispersion gas . in the c - region ,",
    "several of these high dispersion spots are caused by multiple peaked spectra , but there is a small area of faint , broad line emission at the southern tip of the c feature , right before the feature narrows and @xmath31 drops to 6 - 10 .",
    "it is evident too that the nucleus is a region of high velocity dispersion .",
    "measured on the naturally weighted map , the average velocity dispersion in the m1 arm is @xmath33  and @xmath34  in the m2 arm before the emission gap at radius 55@xmath2 . after the gap , the average dispersion is about the same for both arms , @xmath35 .",
    "the average dispersion on the b1 structure is @xmath36 .",
    "the emission from the molecular spurs and the d clouds is in general of low dispersion ( 4 - 8 ) , except for a few positions along s1 . the general result , that the dispersion of the interarm emission gas is lower than that of the arm emission , is consistent with the single dish result ( at lower resolution ) by kuno and nakai ( 1997 ) who suggest that the dispersion is higher on the arms because of the streaming motions .",
    "indeed , @xmath37 on the m1 arm is reduced from 12 to 9  at the higher resolution offered by the robustly weighted map .",
    "we estimate the molecular mass in the inner @xmath38 to be @xmath39 m@xmath23 , by adopting a standard co to h@xmath22 mass conversion factor ( see table 1 ) .",
    "since between 70% and 40% of the total flux is not detected by the interferometer , the real molecular mass in this region could be as high as @xmath40 m@xmath23 assuming that the same mass conversion factor holds for the arm and interarm gas .",
    "however , according to nakai and kuno ( 1995 ) , arimoto , sofue and tsujomoto ( 1996 ) and adler ( 1992 ) , the co to h@xmath22 conversion factor for the inner 4.5kpc of m51 is lower by a factor of 23 than the galactic mean value adopted here , increasing with radius .",
    "these values are based on co - independent determinations of molecular masses by applying optical extinction measurements or assuming virial equilibrium and comparable to the lowest values suggested for our galactic disk .      using the naturally weigthted map ( figure 1a )",
    ", we partitioned the observed emission into arm and interarm regions to determine the interferometric arm to interarm ratio .",
    "the arms were defined by the lowest contour in figure 1a .",
    "we have classified everything outside the main stellar arms as interarm  for instance , the b1 and b2 features have been considered interarm as have the spurs protruding from the main arms . in jy / beam",
    "the mean flux in the arms is 3000 and that in the interarm regions is 190 resulting in an average arm - to - interarm ratio of about 16 .",
    "the interarm regions have a total integrated flux of 390 jy , and the arm regions have 2300 jy .",
    "this gives a total flux ratio of 5.9 , and with the standard conversion factor ( see table 1 ) the mass in the interarm molecular gas observed here is about @xmath41 m@xmath23 .",
    "the _ actual _ arm - to - interarm flux ratio depends on how the missing flux is distributed .",
    "if the unseen emission is evenly distributed across the map , the actual arm - to - interarm ratio will be lower than that just derived .",
    "the total flux in our map is 2700 jy ; assuming an equal amount is unobserved , and evenly distributed across the map , the arm - to - interarm contrast is reduced to about 3 .",
    "the arm to interarm mass ratio would then be 1.3 instead of 6 . in the same way , vogel ,",
    "kulkarni and scoville ( 1988 ) estimate from their interferometric co map an arm - to - interarm mean flux ratio of 2.4 - 3.0 .",
    "however , adler   ( 1992 ) argue that when combining a single dish map ( the oso 20 m map of rydbeck  1985 ) with their aperture synthesis bima map , most of the missing flux is instead distributed in close association with the arms , making them broader , and they measure an arm - to - interarm mean flux ratio @xmath424.6 .",
    "single - dish measurements detect all of the flux , but may lack sufficient resolution to clearly distinguish between arm and interarm regions . previously measured single - dish co arm - to - interarm ratios for m51 show average values of the mean arm - to - interarm flux ratio of 3 - 5 , but also significant variation with radius : garca - burillo  ( 1993a ) measure a _ peak _",
    "arm - to - interarm ratio that increases with radius from 2 to 6 .",
    "kuno and nakai ( 1997 ) find very similar values of 1.5 - 7 , again increasing with radius , with the nro telescope .",
    "the molecular arm - to - interarm flux ratio is interesting as an indication of the presence and strength of a density wave in a galaxy ( e.g. roberts and stewart 1987 ; elmegreen 1988 ) . the density contrast increases with increasing strength of the spiral gravitational field ( e.g. shu , milione and roberts ( 1973 ) ) .",
    "roberts ( 1993 ) , for example , finds an arm - to - interarm contrast of 6 for a 10% modal spiral driving . while our map is the first large scale interferometric data set to detect significant interarm emission in m51 , the contrast of 12 we find is still likely to be an upper limit .",
    "thus , the arm / interarm contrast from our data can not be used to constrain spiral density wave models beyond stating that it is generally compatible with them .",
    "since the ism passes into and out of the arms cyclically , the flow of matter must obey the continuity equation in order to conserve mass .",
    "thus , if @xmath43 is the time a molecule stays in the arm and @xmath44 is the time it spends in the interarm region , then @xmath45 . in principle , it should be possible to determine arm residence timescales from this requirement .",
    "our limits of arm - to - interarm mass ratio of 1.3 to 5 are not restrictive enough to pursue this , but a combination with single dish data might make a detailed analysis feasible in the future .",
    "m51 is one of the galaxies where the strongest evidence for density waves has been found ( e.g. rand 1993b ) .",
    "the magnitude of the streaming motions is unusually high ( e.g. tully 1974b ; rydbeck  1985 ; rk ; vogel  1993 ) amounting to about 100  in the plane of the galaxy  a factor of two higher than predicted by linear theory , or non - linear simulations ( e.g. tully 1974b ; roberts and stewart 1987 ) . in previous co work at ovro ( vogel , kulkarni and scoville 1988 ;",
    "rk ; rand 1993a ( r93 ) ) both radial and tangential streaming motions in the arms of m51 were detected , and streaming motions are also evident in single dish co data ( e.g. rydbeck  1985 ; garca - burillo  1993ab ; kuno  1995 ) .",
    "density waves are expected to cause velocity jumps and discontinuities across molecular spiral arms .",
    "tangential streaming is expected to be the most apparent along the major axis , radial streaming along the minor axis . along the major axis",
    "the highest local velocities ( negative on the blueshifted side of the galaxy and positive on the redshifted side ) are found on the outside of the arm , and on the inside one finds the lowest local velocities . outside of corotation , the situation is reversed . on the minor axis , a radial velocity discontinuity ,",
    "a decrease followed by an increase , across the arm is expected . in our map",
    "the density wave perturbations begin ( for the m1 arm ) at a radius of 22@xmath2 ( @xmath3 1 kpc ) , and it appears that the streaming motions are more distinct in the brighter , broader m1 arm than in the m2 arm .",
    "roberts and stewart ( 1987 ) ( rs ) have made simulations of the response of the interstellar medium to a spiral potential , treating individual molecular clouds as point particles . in their model",
    "the spiral forcing amplitude relative to the central axisymmetric force is moderate , i.e. 10% .",
    "they studied models that included dissipative cloud - cloud collisions and simplified cases without cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "they find that dissipative cloud - cloud collisions are necessary to stabilize the streaming motion pattern in time , and will produce stronger , sharper velocity and density profiles than the non - collisional case .",
    "figure 5 shows the cloud density , tangential and radial velocity components plotted vs. spiral phase , from rs dissipative case simulations .",
    "note that , for m51 , the notion of a ( quasi ) steady density wave ( e.g. lin and shu 1964 ) may be incorrect if the waves are triggered by swing amplification by the passing of the companion galaxy ( e.g. toomre 1981 ) . in this case , the density wave pattern is transient and a steady streaming motion pattern may be unlikely .      according to the rs model ( figure 5 ) the tangential streaming decreases",
    "as gas approaches an arm and then quickly increases across the arm .",
    "there is a very sudden change in slope , a sharply pointed trough , indicating a shock .    where both the m1 and m2 arms cross the major axis ( at radius 55@xmath2 ) there is a gap in co intensity .",
    "we have therefore studied the streaming motions in these arms at @xmath46 off the major axis .",
    "figure 6a and 6b show the robustly weighted ( @xmath11 resolution ) velocity field ( contours ) overlayed on the integrated intensity ( grayscale ) in the southern and northern arm - crossing regions , respectively . in figure",
    "6a the gmas previously studied by r93 , a8 and a9 , are marked as well as a gma between these that we call a10 .",
    "_ the non - linearity of the streaming motions is clearly evident here : the velocity contours are not evenly spaced across the arm , but instead a narrow region of densely spaced contours indicates a very steep increase in velocity_.    furthermore , figure 6a clearly shows that streaming is highly uneven along the arm .",
    "most of the streaming occurs _ before _ cloud a9 and _ through _ a10 . in a8",
    "some streaming can be detected but the gradient is not as steep as at a10 .",
    "streaming velocity gradients through five gmas and three inter - cloud regions ( ic1,ic2,ic3 in figues 6a and 6b ) are listed in table 3 . as is evident from the table ,",
    "gradients vary significantly from gma to gma , the highest being that through a10 , with 700  kpc@xmath13 and the lowest through a9 with 65  kpc@xmath13 . in general , _ gradients appear steeper in between gmas_. ic1 is the region upstream of a9 and between a9 and a10 and has the highest velocity gradients measured in this map , 800 - 1300  kpc@xmath13 .",
    "although rand ( r93 ) found a similar total magnitude of the streaming motions , he measured a significantly lower gradient of @xmath47 kpc@xmath13 at the southern arm crossing .",
    "he also assumed the gradient to be constant along the arm .",
    "the difference probably results from rand s poorer uv coverage and angular resolution .",
    "the highest total magnitude of the tangential streaming motions , 150 , is measured through a10 .",
    "the magnitude of the streaming motions is somewhat lower on the ne arm , about 100 across a2 .",
    "why do we see such structure in streaming motions and streaming motion gradients along the arm ? is this just an effect of the gmas progressing across the arm , with a9 perhaps having entered a region of low velocity gradient further downstream , or is it related to the cloud s internal response to streaming ?",
    "indeed , the presence of gmas and the structure of the streaming are related , since the steepness of the gradient increases between the complexes .",
    "it seems that the presence of clouds does indicate lower shear regions , either because clouds form preferentially in such regions or because many of them have detached themselves more or less completely from higher shear regions .",
    "streaming motions have been suggested as conducive to molecular cloud formation .",
    "a local solid body rotation is supposedly created which increases shear time scales giving the gas enough time to form complexes before they pass into the harsh inter - arm region .",
    "the shear time - scale is the inverse of oort s a - constant ( e.g. elmegreen 1988 ) :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the radius and @xmath50 the circular velocity .",
    "it is clear from this relation that for the shear to be successfully counteracted , @xmath51 must be very close to @xmath52 , i.e. local conditions must approach solid body rotation .",
    "rand ( 1993b ) used this relation to estimate shear time scales . for",
    "clouds on the ne ( m2 ) and sw ( m1 ) arms at 2.7 kpc from the nucleus values of @xmath51 close to 80  kpc@xmath13 would reduce shear effectively .",
    "he found velocity gradients close to 60  kpc@xmath13 for the ne arm and about 100  kpc@xmath13 for the sw arm .",
    "for both arms , shear time scales were thus increased by about a factor of 5 compared to the differential rotation case , with the shear becoming slightly reverse in the south .    however , for the same regions , our conclusions are different . in general , the gradients that we measure are at least a factor of two higher than what rand ( 1993b ) finds for the southern arm crossing , implying that a condition of strong reverse shear will exist . to judge from the above relation",
    ", this reverse shear will be even greater than shear in the pure differential rotation case .",
    "shear timescales for selected gmas and intercloud regions are listed in table 3 , together with the corresponding oort constants . in the regions of extremely steep gradients found in between gmas and through a10",
    ", this effect becomes so pronounced that it results in significantly shorter shear timescales than from a flat rotation .",
    "thus , _ the conclusion that shear is generally reduced by streaming motions in spiral arms must be reconsidered .",
    "of the three gmas studied on the sw arm , only a9 shows reduced shear . _",
    "thus , conditions close to solid body rotation do occur , but apparently not _ throughout _ the arms .",
    "future statistical studies of cloud stability on the arms will have to take the varying degree of shear into account instead of generally assuming that shear is low . for more typical spirals where the average streaming motions are smaller",
    ", the shear may still be generally reduced in the arms .",
    "since the situation is likely to be complex , however , detailed high resolution studies of the velocity fields of the arms in a number of galaxies are necessery to decide this question .",
    "elmegreen ( 1988 ) points out that shear may not be such an important factor in forming complexes when the gas is highly dissipative , since the incident kinetic energy will be removed by processes such as cloud - cloud collisions . in this context",
    ", the variation in steepness of the velocity gradient along the arm may be interpreted as the gmas having shed some of the strong reverse shear induced by the density wave , which still persists between the clouds . a10",
    "may still be in the process of such a dissipation .",
    "it is quite suggestive that the region of reverse shear exists _ upstream _ of a9 , suggesting the possibility that a9 once passed through this high - shear region on its way downstream .",
    "the existence of the s1 and s2 spurs makes it possible to study the velocity structure of gas in the interarm region .",
    "figure 6c shows a position - velocity cut ( pv - diagram ) through the s1 spur .",
    "the agreement with the rs prediction is good ; the tangential velocity decreases just before the gas enters the arm and then increases steeply in the arm .",
    "the expected peak in dispersion ( roberts 1993 ) right before the arm is also present in our data .",
    "we can measure the magnitude of interarm tangential streaming in these spur regions , and find that the gradient is @xmath47 kpc@xmath13 , in the opposite direction to the arm gradient as qualitatively expected .",
    "this reversed streaming is also expected at the outside of the arm .",
    "there is a strong concentration of gas 15@xmath2 - 20@xmath2 away from the m2 arm .",
    "this possible gma seems to exist where the steep reversed tangential streaming begins to flatten out .",
    "note that the dispersion in the gas also decreases in this region .",
    "perhaps the d clouds have formed in similar calm regions in spurs between the arms .",
    "single dish studies suggest arm widths of @xmath53 instead of the @xmath54 we find here .",
    "the structure along s1 indicates that the velocity reversals occur @xmath55 away from the arm center .",
    "the broader arm widths thus imply that the single dish surveys are picking up emission from the velocity reversal regions .",
    "the reversed streaming in these regions may be more disruptive to gmas than even the high shear regions in the arm since the amount of dissipation will decrease with distance from the arm center .",
    "tidal forces and flow expansion are other disruptive agents that may tear gmas apart in the velocity reversal regions ( rand 1993b ) .",
    "perhaps the co emission here largely originates in diffuse unbound gas that the interferometer will filter out , but the single dish instruments can detect .",
    "figure 6d shows a pv - diagram along the minor axis which goes through the two main spiral arms at a radius of 25@xmath2 to 35@xmath2 .",
    "figure 6e shows a close up of the velocity discontinuity across the m1 arm .",
    "there is good agreement with the rs radial streaming model ( dashed line in figure 6e ) , with the steep decrease in velocity , the density peak of the arm occuring at the velocity minima , and then the increase in velocity on the outer side of the arm .",
    "the magnitude of the shift is roughly 95 .",
    "high resolution is needed to resolve the shifts and even at @xmath11 resolution , the shift is still somewhat unresolved , but an estimate is that it occurs on roughly 5@xmath2 ( 230 pc ) , which means that the gradient is 430  kpc@xmath13 .",
    "rand ( 1993b ) , however , finds only a 60  shift in the ionized gas ( h@xmath6 ) at the same arm crossing .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear , but if there is a displacement between the molecular and ionized gas , the h@xmath6 might miss the region of steepest gradient .",
    "extinction may also hamper the interpretation of the h@xmath6 emission .",
    "the radial streaming motions are not as pronounced on the eastern ( m2 arm ) minor axis .",
    "although a drop in velocity can be detected on the inside of the arm , it is of smaller magnitude , 50 , than on the west side , and the expected rise in velocity on the outside of the arm is absent .",
    "the interpretation is also complicated by the multiple velocity structure of the gas inside the arm , at radius 0 - 23@xmath2 .",
    "the figure reveals two emission regions , one peaking at 440 , the other at 490 , although they are at the same radius along the same cut through the minor axis .",
    "vogel  ( 1993 ) also note that , for their fabry - perot h@xmath6 data , the streaming for the m2 arm where it first crosses the minor axis is weaker than what is measured for the m1 arm on the corresponding position . they attribute this to the more complex gas response ( as indicated by dust lane morphology ) of the m2 arm close to the oval distortion .",
    "although streaming motions can be observed along the m1 arm all the way between the minor and major axis arm crossings , very little streaming can be detected on the m2 arm until the major axis crossing in the north .",
    "the reason for this lack of streaming in the first quadrant of m2 is unclear .",
    "it can hardly be attributed to complex velocity structure which is suggested to explain the lack of streaming on the minor axis ( see above ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that the m2 arm in this region is only half as thick as the m1 arm and may be too narrow for a display of the full velocity range of the arm streaming .",
    "we would then expect to see streaming in m2 in another tracer than co , sampling a different region of the arm .",
    "vogel  ( 1993 ) , however , note the lack of streaming in m2 in their h@xmath6 map as well .",
    "perhaps the reason can be found in an assymmetry in the matter distribution .",
    "the shape of the radial and tangential velocity components in figure 5 shows sharp deceleration and troughs , signifying the presence of a galactic shock . in the early models , self - gravity",
    "was not included and lubow  ( 1986 ) suggested that introducing self - gravity would smooth density and velocity profiles , removing the shock structures .",
    "roberts ( 1993 ) however reports that when including self - gravity in the simulations the abrupt velocity structure remains , even though the density profile becomes somewhat smoother .",
    "our maps offer , for the first time , sufficient resolution to resolve the structure in the molecular streaming motions .",
    "as we have seen above , both the radial and tangential velocity components show steep gradients ( see figues 6a , 6b , and 6e ) in accordance with predictions by the rs models .",
    "the region ic1 ( in figure 6a ) , for example , clearly delineates the shock structure formed on the southern arm crossing of the major axis .",
    "_ our data thus support the presence of shocks in the arms of m51_. the fact that the shock structure and magnitude varies along the arms indicates that local effects enter to modify the effects of large - scale dynamics .    single dish surveys ( garca - burillo 1993ab ; kuno and nakai 1997 ) report a more gradual change of the velocity vector across the arms .",
    "kuno and nakai ( 1997 ) find that the deceleration of the radial velocity component continues for about 1 kpc ( @xmath56 ) . because of this smoothness",
    ", they conclude that galactic shocks do not occur in the arms of m51 . at their resolution ( @xmath57 ) , however , the sharpness of the velocity profiles will be smeared , since the gradient occurs on a scale of @xmath58 and we suggest insuffcient resolution in the single dish studies is the main cause of the discrepancy .",
    "lubow ( 1993 ) and bertin ( 1993 ) discuss the behaviour of the cold gas component at resonances and how one may use observations of gas in galaxies to detect resonance locations . due to its dissipative nature",
    ", the gas behaviour at the resonances is expected to be quite different from that of the stars , masking the location of the resonance or , in some cases , revealing it through conspicious features .",
    "shu , milione and roberts ( 1973 ) suggested that a second compression of the interstellar gas , associated with an ultraharmonic @xmath59=2 resonance , may generate secondary spiral features .",
    "patsis ( 1997 ) studied the response of a gaseous disk to a spiral perturbation , and their models show arm bifurcations and secondary arms between the main arms .",
    "they suggest that these bifurcations are the sign of the 4/1 ultraharmonic resonance and could serve as good resonance indicators .",
    "artymowicz and lubow ( 1992 , al ) also predict the launching of a second wave in the gas at the location of the lowest order ultraharmonic resonance .",
    "the resonance may result in the termination , or severe depression , of the main arm ( e.g. contopoulos and gr@xmath5sbol 1986 ; al ) .",
    "contopoulos and gr@xmath5sbol also expect larger deviations from circular orbits near the resonance which should result in increased radial streaming motions in the gas .",
    "the arm bifurcations in our figure 1a are symmetrically located on opposite sides of the galactic center at a radius of @xmath60 ( 3.3 kpc at @xmath61=9.6 mpc ) .",
    "they are very similar to those in the models by patsis and coworkers , which leads us to suggest that the b1 and b2 cloud chains may be faint , patchy , secondary spiral arms caused by the 4/1 resonance .",
    "according to patsis  the actual resonance occurs somewhere between the arm bifurcation and the termination of the arm .",
    "rand ( 1993b ) places the 4/1 resonance in m51 close to 3.9 kpc based on an intensity minima in the main co arm .",
    "he also finds large streaming motions ( 125 ) right before the minima at 85@xmath2 radius .",
    "we find similar velocity shifts , 130 , in the gas at the location of the two bifurcations ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "if the rotation curve is known , the location of one resonance will predict the position of the other resonances ( e.g. binney and tremaine , 1987 ) .",
    "there are , for example , several studies that have aimed at identifying the location of the corotation resonance ( tully 1974 ; ees ; vogel ( 1993 ) ; garca - burillo 1993 ) , see table 4 , and we can use it to predict the expected location of the 4/1 resonance . we adopt @xmath49=6 kpc as the position of the corotation resonance , although the total range in table 4 is 5.8 - 7.4 kpc . for a mestel disk ( i.e. a disk in which surface density is inversely proportional to radius resulting in a flat rotation curve , e.g. binney and tremaine ( 1987 ) ) , having corotation at 6 kpc will place the 4/1 resonance roughly at 3.8 kpc .",
    "the estimated positions for the ilr lies between 1.4 - 1.7 kpc ( tully 1974b ; garca - burillo  1993 , see table 4 ) , and for a mesteldisk this places the 4/1 resonance between 3.0 and 3.9 kpc .",
    "ees suggests that the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) lies at @xmath49=8 kpc which , for the same model , places the 4/1 resonance at @xmath49=3 kpc .      according to contopoulos and gr@xmath5sbol ( 1986 )",
    "the 4/1 resonance should represent the limiting radius for ( strong ) spiral arm structure , and the main arms should stop not far beyond .",
    "al agree that the 4/1 resonance may result in strong losses , but the amplitude further out at corotation could still be large .    in m51",
    ", the spiral pattern clearly continues beyond the suggested location of the 4/1 resonance .",
    "the co arm is indeed suppressed close to the resonance ( e.g. rand 1993b , see above ) but commences again at larger radius .",
    "it has been suggested that there are two pattern speeds in m51 , with the outer arms belonging to a different pattern , driven by the companion galaxy ngc  5195 ( tully 1974b ; elmegreen , elmegreen , and seiden 1989 ( ees ) ; vogel  1993 ) .",
    "ees , for example , propose 1 . an inner spiral mode that has an outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) at the position of a prominent arm intensity gap at @xmath49=8 kpc ( pattern speed 90 ) , 2 . and an outer material arm that corotates with the companion ( pattern speed 22 ) .",
    "they argue that the position of the ilr of the outer arms occurs at the same radius as the corotation resonance of the inner spiral , and they suggest that the outer spiral triggers a response in the vicinity of its ilr which stimulates corotation of an inner spiral wavemode .",
    "the radius of the ilr of the outer spiral mode represents the inner limit to its extent and therefore , the inner spiral structure extends beyond its 4/1 resonance , at least out to corotation .",
    "toomre ( 1981 ) argues that the grand design spiral structure of m51 is largely the result of a strong , transient perturbation , and that the density waves excited by it are likely to differ significantly from those considered in the density wave theory of isolated systems .",
    "specifically , the 4/1 resonance should not be excited in such a transient encounter .",
    "as we have discussed , however , the arm bifurcations , co intensity minima and large streaming motions are expected signs of the 4/1 resonance .",
    "ees also discuss optical evidence for the presence of a 4/1 resonance .",
    "further studies , theoretical and observational , are necessary to resolve this issue .",
    "the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) occurs at the apparent termination of spiral structure at a radius of @xmath62 ( e.g. tully 1974b ; this work )",
    ". however , narrow tongue - like features in the central 25@xmath2 of our robustly weighted co map ( figure 7 ) hint at the possibility of an inner compact pattern in m51 .",
    "the possibility of such structure was first raised by zaritsky , rix and rieke ( 1993 , zrr ) , who from a k - band image residual found evidence of spiral arms inside the ilr .",
    "they claim that these arms continue to wind through an additional 540@xmath8 beyond the ilr , ending at about 10@xmath2 from the nucleus .",
    "they further suggest the existence in the innermost 10@xmath2 of a small bar , possibly an oval bulge .",
    "it is surprising to find spiral arms inside the ilr since it is generally claimed that a density wave will not propagate there ( e.g. lubow 1993 ) . by analogy with the outer material arms , however , the structure within the ilr may not be part of the same pattern as the spiral structure beyond a radius of 25@xmath2 : arms , for example , may be driven by a central bar , or by the spiral pattern further out .",
    "it is also possible that the assumed position of the ilr is wrong and should be placed at much shorter radius .",
    "this is a possibility since it is difficult to measure the rotation curve in the very center of the galaxy .",
    "we have attempted to compare the zrr k - band image of the inner spiral structure with our robustly weighted co map to see if the spiral arms in the zrr map ( dashed lines in figure 7 ) can be identified with the features in the molecular gas . some of the narrow co features in the inner arcminute are found to agree in position with the k - band arms , but some do not .",
    "the width of these tentative molecular arms is about 5@xmath2 and the structure is patchy , not tracing the arms fully , as is also true for the k - band arms .",
    "the presence of a bar in the inner region of m51 has been discussed by several authors ( e.g. tully 1974b ; smith  1990 ; pierce 1986 ; zrr ; garca - burillo  1993b ; kohno  1997 ) .",
    "tully ( 1974 ) identifies the ilr with the observed terminal radius of the ( main ) spiral structure at 25@xmath2 and from deviations of circular motions in his h@xmath6 data suggests the existence of an oval dispersion ring inside the ilr with pa 130@xmath8 , causing gas streaming on elliptical orbits , as found by tully ( 1974b ) .",
    "there seems to be a general consensus that the pa of the bar , if it exists , is approximately 130@xmath8 , but the length of the bar is fairly uncertain : between 10@xmath2 and 20@xmath2 ( e.g. pierce 1986 ; zrr ) .",
    "our data show no continuous gas structure that fills the central bar .",
    "this may be because the bar is filled with diffuse faint molecular gas that the interferometer will filter out , or simply because the bar is deficient in molecular gas , or it may mean there is no central bar at all . the robustly weighted map does show some faint emission connecting the central gas structure to the emission region to the northwest ( see fig 1b ) but this structure is only a few arcseconds long ; discussion of it will be left to paper ii .    in order to look for evidence of non - circular motions in the center , we used the aips gal task to subtract a rotation curve from the naturally weighted velocity field .",
    "initial values were adopted from tully ( 1974a ) : pa=@xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65=464 .",
    "we adopted a rotation curve of the form @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting central residual map is shown in figure 8 . in the inner 30@xmath2",
    "there are two main deviations from the general rotation curve , a blueshifted region to the east and a redshifted region to the west .",
    "the size of the region of deviating velocities is roughly @xmath67 and the pa of the joined structures is about 125@xmath8 .",
    "the magnitude of these deviations is 20 - 30  and they are consistent with gas on elliptical orbits in a bar .",
    "the region of large residual velocities agrees roughly with the end of the k - band spiral arms of zrr  and with the beginning of the bar they suggest is present in the inner @xmath68 .",
    "the structure we have named the c feature ( figure 1a ) is located at the inner end of the main ne ( m2 ) spiral arm , at what we agree is the radius of the ilr of m51 .",
    "the feature also lies at the eastern end of the possible central bar , although we note that the corresponding feature at the western end is not so spectacular .",
    "tully points out that the regions where the spiral arms meet the material on elliptical orbits ( the `` dispersion ring '' ) usually show evidence of abrupt velocity discontinuities , pronounced dust lanes and strong radio continuum emission . in our data",
    "there are multiple spectral peaks at several positions in this region .",
    "as we can see in the dispersion map ( figure 4 ) , the very inner region of the c feature has quite narrow lines ( low dispersion ) while the more complex velocity structure occurs around the `` edges '' of the feature ( as indicated by red regions in figure 4 ) . in the lower ( southern ) region",
    "there are multiple spectral featues , where the less prominent feature is at velocities 20 - 50  lower than the main feature ( figure 9a ) .",
    "it is possible that the low - velocity - feature ( which is about 3 times fainter than the main one ) originates in gas on bar orbits while the brighter emission comes from gas on circular orbits .",
    "the upper ( northern ) `` red '' region also consists of double spectral components , but here the high velocity feature is the fainter one ( figure 9b ) .",
    "there are also some positions where the high dispersion is caused by broad lines , @xmath69 50 , rather than multiple spectra .",
    "we speculate that the disturbances in feature c are the result of high velocity collisions between molecular clouds in different orbits .",
    "if cloud - cloud collisions occur anywhere , they are most plausible in such a region , where central spiral arms , main spiral arms , and gas on elliptical orbits converge .",
    "we have undertaken a new sensitive , high resolution co study of the inner @xmath38 of m51 .",
    "the main results are :    * the emission in the two major arms ( ne and sw ) originates mostly from supermassive cloud complexes ( giant molecular associations , gmas ) which are for the first time resolved both along and perpendicular to the arms .",
    "the brightest ( @xmath17 k ) gma on the sw arm has a fwhm size of 11@xmath2 by 6@xmath2 ( 512 by 280 pc ) and sits on a ridge of co emission 20@xmath18 in size . along the sw arm",
    "we count 16 gmas , with sizes varying from 6@xmath19 to 14@xmath20 .",
    "the overall morphology of the co emission is symmetric in reflection about the nucleus with major complexes occuring opposite each other in the two major arms .",
    "the co line flux in the inner area of the sw arm is approximately twice as bright as that from the analogous location in the ne arm .",
    "the typical one - dimensional velocity dispersion is 7 - 15  on the arms and the arm width varies between 5@xmath2 - 15@xmath2 .",

    "streaming motions due to density waves are evident along the minor and major axis .",
    "the magnitude of the streaming motions is generally very high , 60 - 150 . streaming , however",

    "these features may be evidence of a secondary compression in the density wave caused by the ultraharmonic 4/1 resonance .",
    "we suggest that the arm bifurcations occur near the 4/1 resonance of the spiral pattern , which is then placed between 3.2 and 3.8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "this location of the resonance is consistent with results by rand ( 1993b ) .",
    "the 4/1 resonance is well inside the m51 spiral pattern and this supports the suggestion that m51 has at least two spiral systems .",
    "* other interarm features found are a short chain of low - dispersion clouds midway between the main and secondary arms and several molecular spurs protruding from the main spiral arms , in particular on the western side of the map .",
    "tangential interarm streaming motions are detected along two of the most prominent spurs .",
    "the agreement with the rs prediction is good ; the tangential velocity decreases just before the gas enters the arm and then increases steeply in the arm .",

    "the magnitude of these deviations is 20 - 30  and they are consistent with gas on elliptical orbits in a bar . our data",

    "* we find an unusual structure , an expansion in the ne molecular arm at 25@xmath2 radius ( 1.2 kpc ) southeast of the center .",
    "this broadening occurs right after the end of the ne arm at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "multiple - peak spectra , velocity twists and structures with apparently high velocity dispersion are associated with this feature .",
