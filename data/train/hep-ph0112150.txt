    "it has long been the holy grail for particle and nuclear knights to generate rigorous predictions from the lagrangian of qcd @xmath1 where @xmath2\\nonumber\\\\ d_\\mu q&= & ( \\partial_\\mu -iga_\\mu ) q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , despite the ease with which one can write this equation , because of its inherent nonlinearity and the large value of the coupling constant@xmath3progress in this regard has been slow .",
    "one approach ",
    "lattice gauge theory  holds great promise , but is currently limited by the need for large computational facilities@xcite . a second tack , that of perturbative qcd , exploits the feature of asymptotic freedom  the vanishing of the running coupling constant at high momentum transfer@xcite",
    ". however , such predictions are valid only for the very highest energy processes .",
    "it is gratifying then to see that in recent years a third procedure has become available , that of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) which exploits the chiral symmetry of qcd and allows rigorous predictive power in the case of low energy reactions .",
    "this technique , based on a suggestion due to weinberg@xcite , was developed ( at one loop level ) during the last decade in an important series of papers by gasser and leutwyler and others@xcite .",
    "the idea is based on the feature that the qcd lagrangian  eq .",
    "[ eq : qcd]possesses a global @xmath5 ( chiral ) invariance in the limit of vanishing quark mass .",
    "such invariance is manifested in the real world not in the conventional wigner - weyl fashion .",
    "rather , it is spontaneously broken , resulting in eight light pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone bosons@xmath6which would be massless if the corresponding quark masses also vanished@xcite . while the identification of this symmetry is apparent in terms of quark / gluon degrees of freedom , it is not so simple to understand the implications of chiral invariance in the arena of experimental meson / baryon interactions .",
    "early attempts in this direction were based on current algebra / pcac methods@xcite , yielding relationships between processes differing in the number of pions , _ e.g. _ @xmath7|a>\\ ] ] where @xmath8 mev is the pion decay constant@xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized that the most succinct way to present these restrictions is in terms of an effective chiral lagrangian , the simplest ( two - derivative ) form of which is , in the goldstone sector@xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a nonlinear function of the pseudoscalar fields , @xmath11 is the quark mass matrix , @xmath12 is a phenomenological constant , @xmath13-i\\{a_\\mu , \\}$ ] is the covariant derivative coupling to external fields @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the pion decay constant in the limit of chiral symmetry .",
    "although these are only two of an infinite number of terms , already at this level there exists predictive power_e.g .",
    "_ , tree level evaluation of @xmath16 yields the familiar weinberg predictions ( at @xmath17 ) for s - wave @xmath18 scattering lengths@xcite @xmath19 which are approximately borne out experimentally .",
    "loop diagrams , of course , produce terms of @xmath20 and contain divergences .",
    "however , just as in qed such infinities can be absorbed into renormalizing phenomenological chiral couplings , and the most general `` four - derivative '' lagrangian has been given by gasser and leutwyler@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 are external field strength tensors defined via @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ f^l_\\mu & = & v_\\mu + a_\\mu \\qquad f^r_\\mu = v_\\mu - a_\\mu .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the bare @xmath24 coefficients are themselves unphysical and are related to empirical quantities @xmath25 measured at scale @xmath26 via @xmath27 where @xmath28 are constants defined in ref .",
    "4b and @xmath29 is the usual parameter arising in dimensional regularization , with @xmath30 being the number of dimensions .",
    "gasser and leutwyler have obtained empirical values for the phenomenological constants @xmath31 , values for some of which are given in table 1 .",
    ".empirical values of chiral expansion parameters(@xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe that the central values stay fixed but that the error bars are somewhat reduced .",
    "the conclusions are the same , however  substantial renormalization for @xmath34 , almost none for @xmath35 , and a mixing angle @xmath36 .",
    "these numbers appear nearly invariant , regardless of the approach .",
    "an interesting aside here is the recent observation by br and wiese that the @xmath37 reaction alone does not verify the three color hypothesis  in a careful analysis the @xmath38-dependence of the wess - zumino - witten term is completely canceled by the @xmath38-dependent part of a goldstone - wilczek term , and that it is only the @xmath39 measurement which truly confirms the result that @xmath40@xcite .    having",
    "above confirmed the basic correctness of the predictions of the anomaly ( and thereby of this important cornerstone of qcd ) we move now to the important three pion decay of the eta , which occurs independent of the anomaly and which rather probes the conventional two- and four - derivative piece of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the decay of the isoscalar eta to the predominantly i=1 final state of the three pion system occurs primarily on account of the d - u quark mass difference@xcite , and the result arising from lowest order chiral perturbation theory is well - known@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43\\label{eq : qq}\\ ] ] and we have defined @xmath44 equivalently , we can write the prefactor of eq . [ eq : qq ] in a form which respects the reparameterization invariance of kaplan and manohar@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the average @xmath48 quark mass .",
    "thus the decay @xmath49 can be used in order to determine the quantity @xmath50 . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath50 is given from some other process then the @xmath51 amplitude is completely determined .",
    "the standard approach to such a determination is to utilize the pseudoscalar meson masses via the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the nonelectromagnetic component of the @xmath54 mass difference @xmath55 in order to evaluate the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : da ] one generally uses dashen s theorem , which guarantees the identity of the electromagnetic piece of the kaon and pion electromagnetic mass shifts in the chiral symmetric limit@xcite @xmath56 this simple assumption gives then @xmath57 and results in a prediction @xmath58 in strong contradiction to the experimental result @xmath59 at first sight this would appear to be a rather strong and irreparable violation of a lowest order chiral prediction and therefore not salvagable by the expected @xmath60 corrections from higher order effects .",
    "however , this is not at all the case .",
    "in fact the one - loop and counterterm contributions were calculated by gasser and leutwyler and were found to enhance the lowest order prediction by a factor 2.6 , yielding@xcite @xmath61 which is a significant improvement , but still somewhat too low .",
    "the origin of such a large correction lies primarily with @xmath62 mixing which generates a factor @xmath63 leaving the expected @xmath64 corrections due to conventional higher order loop and counterterm contributions .",
    "however , recent work has indicated that eq .",
    "[ eq : kk ] is probably a considerable underestimate due a significant violation of dashen s theorem . indeed ,",
    "the dashen requirement was derived in the limit of chiral symmetry@xmath65and plausible estimates of chiral breaking effects have yielded the estimate@xcite @xmath66 which corresponds to an additional @xmath6740% enhancement of the chiral calculation eq .",
    "[ eq : kk ] , _ i.e. _ @xmath68 , and puts the result in the right ballpark .",
    "there are at least two possible sources for the existence of any remaining discrepancy .",
    "one is the fact that the estimate for the size of dashen s theorem violation is just that  an estimate .",
    "it is possible that the size of the violation is more significant than that given in eq .",
    "[ eq : pp ] , leading to an even larger value for @xmath69 .",
    "a second possibility is that the simple one loop estimate given in ref .",
    "4 is not sufficient to include the full impact of final state interaction effects .",
    "this has been demonstrated in other processes where the i=0 s - wave @xmath18 plays an important role , as it does here@xcite .",
    "indeed the closely related @xmath70 reaction is one such case@xcite .    in order to decide which",
    " if either ",
    "possibility obtains it is necessary to make careful spectral shape measurements in addition to simple lifetime numbers .",
    "also it is necessary to confront such results with precise theoretical calculations .",
    "phenomenologically , we expand the decay amplitude about the center of the dalitz plot as @xmath71\\ ] ] where @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the q - value .",
    "these parameters have been determined experimentally to be @xmath74 to be compared to the one - loop chiral prediction @xmath75 clearly there is general ( though certainly not excellent ) agreement , suggesting the importance of higher order scattering contributions .",
    "these have been examined by two swiss collaborations using dispersion relation treatments in order to address the problem of higher order three - body scattering effects .",
    "the calculation of anisovich and leutwyler quotes only the integrated decay rate which is is agreement with experiment if the value @xmath76 is chosen@xcite  consistent with the dashen theorem violation calculated in @xcite .",
    "similarly the integrated decay rate found in the khuri - treiman calculation by kambor , wiesendanger , and wyler agrees with the experimental rate if the value @xmath77 is used@xcite .",
    "however , these authors also quote values for the spectral shape @xmath78 where the two sets of numbers correspond to different ways of determining the experimental input .",
    "obviously the slope parameter @xmath79 is in general agreement with experiment .",
    "however , the situation is more complex for the quadratic components . in particular",
    "the calculated values for @xmath80 are in good agreement with the measurement of gormley et al .",
    "( or amsler et al . )",
    "but _ not _ with that of layter et al . however , experimental uncertainties are significant and a new high statistics determination of the spectral shape is needed .",
    "additional information is available by studying the neutral decay mode @xmath81 , for which bose symmetry determines the decay amplitude to be @xmath82 where @xmath83 here the dispersive calculation by kambor et al .",
    "predicts @xmath84 depending on how the experimental input is handled . on the experimental side the only measurement of the energy dependence until recently had been of limited accuracy @xmath85 which is consistent with ( but with large experimental uncertainty ) the dispersive calculation .",
    "however , recently a new result of uncprecedented precision has been announced from the crystal ball group at bnl@xcite @xmath86    clearly this number is significantly larger than expected from the khuri - treiman calculation , suggesting that new dynamical input is involved .",
    "this is not unexpected .",
    "indeed the calculation of kambor et al . utilized the effective chiral lagrangian at @xmath87 is input .",
    "clearly from the agreement with experiment this is the main effect , but one also expects contributions from pieces of the chiral lagrangian of @xmath88 such as @xmath89{\\rm tr}(d^\\nu ud_\\nu u^\\dagger)\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being a constant and @xmath92 is the quark mass matrix , @xmath93 gev is the chiral scale .",
    "the coefficients of such terms are unconstrained by the strictures of chiral invariance and are experimentally undetermined at present , since they arise at two - loop order .",
    "nevertheless , their presence can lead to peices of the decay amplitude of the form @xmath94\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 1\\over 12}m_\\eta^4({\\cal a}_1-{\\cal a}_2)\\left[{2q_\\eta\\over 3m_\\eta}y-{8\\over 27}{q_\\eta^2\\over m_\\eta^2}(y^2-x^2)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if such a dynamical component is present then its size should be set by chiral scaling arguments @xmath95 and an isospin relation @xmath96 must exist between the quadratic parameters for the charged and neutral channels . here",
    "the symbol @xmath97 indicates the dynamical ( _ i.e. _ , non - rescattering component of the coefficient in question and is found by subtracting the theoretical value obtained from the khuri - trieman calculation from the experimental quantity . in this way we find , using the gormley numbers for experimental input , @xmath98 and @xmath99 depending on the dynamical input chosen .",
    "the comparison @xmath100 vs. @xmath101 is obviously satisfactory within errors but again cries out for a high precision measurement of the @xmath102 spectrum , such as would be possible using wasa .",
    "of course , there is one additional test which we can use . since according to isotopic spin invariance the @xmath103 amplitude at the center of the dalitz plot must be a factor of three larger than the corresponding @xmath104 number",
    ", the total decay rates should differ by the factor @xmath105 when rescattering corrections are included , the prediction becomes @xmath106 both numbers are consistent with the value quoted by the particle data group@xcite @xmath107 and are in good agreement with the recent crystal ball measurement@xcite",
    "@xmath108    clearly there is plenty of challenge in the three - pion sector for an eta facility , but there is also interest in examining the remaining radiative modes @xmath109 .",
    "for the decay @xmath111 chiral symmetry does not play a important role , but vector dominance _ does_.",
    "this can be seen from the feature that there exists no contribution at all to this process from the tree level two - derivative lagrangian .",
    "rather the lowest order chiral contribution arises at one - loop level@xmath112 . however , the @xmath113 intermediate intermediate state is suppressed by the factor @xmath114 while the contribution from @xmath115 is suppressed kinematically . to see this",

    "[ eq : qq ] and @xmath119 with a similar expression obtaining for the kaon loop contribution .",
    "calculation of the associated rate yields@xcite @xmath120 thus the one - loop chiral contribution plays a very minor role .",
    "consider , however , the vector dominance diagram shown in figure 8 , for which @xmath121\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left({f_\\pi\\over f_8}\\cos\\theta -\\sqrt{2}{f_\\pi\\over f_0\\sin\\theta}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ e(s , t , u)&=&-{2\\sqrt{3}\\over 9}g_{\\omega\\rho\\pi}^2\\left({2ef_\\pi^2g\\over m_v^2 } \\right)\\left [ { 1\\over m_v^2-t}+{1\\over m_v^2-u}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left({f_\\pi\\over f_8}\\cos\\theta   -\\sqrt{2}{f_\\pi\\over f_0}\\sin\\theta\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and yielding for the decay rate @xmath122    inclusion of other higher order effects such as the contribution from a pair of anomalous terms@xmath123 and @xmath124coupled via a pion loop increases this estimate to about half the experimental result , but a considerable discrepancy remains and should be the focus of future experimental as well as theoretical work .",
    "a new number from the brookhaven experiment was first announced at this meeting by nefkens @xmath125 is about a factor of two smaller than the particle data group value .",
    "the problem with the previous measurements is probably associated with eliminating the background from other much more probably neutral modes such as @xmath126 and confirmation using wasa would clearly be welcome . in this",
    "regard , spectral shape measurements could be helpful , although this will be difficult , since this is a low branching ratio@xmath127experiment .",
    "the final mode which we shall mention in this report is @xmath129 , for which on the experimental side there exists at present only an upper bound@xcite @xmath130 ordinarily the dominant component of a radiative mode such as this is due to the the inner bremsstrahlung process , for which the matrix element is @xmath131\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it is experimentally difficult to distinguish any direct photon emission .",
    "however , an exception occurs when the non - radiative process is suppressed in some fashion , such as occurs , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the cases of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , wherein the nonradiative process is small because of helicity suppression and cp violation respectively@xcite .",
    "one might have anticipated the same enhancement mechanism to apply in our case since the nonradiative reaction @xmath134 takes place only due to the relatively small u - d quark mass difference .",
    "for example , the direct emission associated with the vector - dominance diagrams shown in figure 9 could be expected to play an important role . however , a careful analysis by dambrosio et al .",
    "has shown that this unfortunately does not appear to be the case@xcite .",
    "the contribution from this direct  vector - dominated  mechanism is found to have the form @xmath135\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 and the combination of bose symmetry and gauge invariance results in a suppression that makes such pieces even smaller than the pion loop component , which arise to @xmath87 and which are proportional to @xmath137 . in ref . @xcite it is estimated that the direct emission ( de ) component is only a few percent addition to the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) , even at relatively large photon energies @xmath138_{e_\\gamma>90\\,\\,{\\rm mev}}\\simeq 3.5\\times 10^{-2}\\ ] ] which appears to be too small to make this a realistic experimental goal .",
    "we have examined the `` non - rare '' decay modes of the eta meson@xmath139in light of current theoretical knowledge and within the general framework of chiral symmetry . while there exist no _ striking _ discrepancies observed with respect to any of these predictions , we clearly identified problem areas wherein additional experimental scrutiny , such as would be possible at celsius , would add significantly to our understanding .",
    "these conclusions can be summarized succinctly as follows :    @xmath140a resolution of the discrepancy between the rates measured via the primakoff effect@xcite and via qed production@xcite is essential to future progress in understanding the eta system in general .",
    "@xmath142a precise spectral shape measurement is called for in order to determine whether the existing disagreement between experimental findings and ( what should be ) solid theoretical predictions based on chiral perturbation theory are cause by an inaccurate value for the d - u quark mass difference or are due to the importance of higher order final state interaction effects .",
    "@xmath143a precision measurement of the dalitz plot distribution is suggested in order to learn the origin of the existing disagreement between the experimental rate and that predicted from vector dominance .",
    "@xmath144a determination of an actual rate instead of the existing upper bound would be of interest , but theoretical indications are that it will be difficult to detect other than the inner bremsstrahlung component .    clearly there is lots of interesting physics here and a marriage between precise and solid new experimental data and careful and well - motivated theoretical analysis would , i predict , be a happy one , leading to the offspring of a new degree of understanding of an important component of low energy phenomenology .",
