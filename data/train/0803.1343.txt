    "in a system of non - interacting electrons disorder can induce transitions between metallic ( delocalized ) and insulating ( localized ) phases @xcite .",
    "the scaling theory of localization @xcite predicts that in two dimensions ( 2d ) , all single particle electronic states are typically localized by arbitrarily weak disorder and consequently , there are no metal - insulator transitions for non - interacting electrons ( except in the situations discussed below ) .",
    "this scaling idea can be substantiated quantitatively through a non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) formulation of the problem using either the replica@xcite or supersymmetry@xcite method .",
    "the nlsm approach has been very successful in providing a quantitative understanding of the metal - insulator critical point in dimensions greater than two ( for a review , see [ , ] ) .",
    "there are two well known exceptions to the above discussion .",
    "one is the 2d integer quantum hall ( iqh ) plateau transition and the other is the metal - insulator transition in 2d systems with spin - orbit scattering ( the so - called ` symplectic symmetry class ' ) .",
    "these possess phases of both localized as well as extended states in 2d .",
    "on one hand , both these transitions can be formulated as nlsm field theories@xcite ( containing an additional , topological term in the iqh case ) .",
    "but , on the other hand , these field theories can not be used to perform analytical ( or even perturbative ) calculations of critical exponents or other ( universal ) physical quantities at the transition .",
    "this is because the long - distance physics relevant for the properties at the transition is governed by the strong - coupling regime of these theories , which is in general not tractable .",
    "indeed , such a calculation would require a non - perturbative approach to these problems .",
    "some progress on these types of problems has been possible in recent years due to the appearance of models which are analytically tractable even at strong coupling and which exhibit similar localization - delocalization ( ld ) transitions , but belong to symmetry ( and universality ) classes different from the ones discussed above . indeed ,",
    "seminal work due to zirnbauer , and altland and zirnbauer@xcite , which appeared a little more than a decade ago , has identified a total of ten symmetry classes , describing in principle all possible behaviors of non - interacting quantum mechanical particles subject to random disorder potentials . examples of such analytically tractable 2d localization - delocalization ( ld ) transitions include 2d dirac fermions subject to random abelian @xcite and non - abelian gauge potentials @xcite , the spin quantum hall ( sqh ) plateau transition @xcite ( reviewed briefly in section [ physicsc ] below ) , and problems with a special so - called ` sublattice symmetry ' @xcite .",
    "ld transitions are different in several respects from continuous phase transitions occurring in non - random systems , such as the ordering transition in a clean ferromagnet .",
    "one difference is the absence of an obvious order parameter in many cases .",
    "the disorder - averaged density of states which would be expected to play the role of an order parameter , is not critical@xcite at many conventional ld transitions , including those mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "another very important difference is that the wave functions at the transition exhibit what is known as multifractal scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "this means that the disorder average of the @xmath0-th power of the ( square of ) the critical wave function amplitude scales with the system size @xmath1 with a non - trivial exponent that has a non - linear dependence on the power @xmath0 . in field - theoretic",
    "language , multifractality can be understood as the existence of a certain infinite set of fields in the theory which exhibit infinitely many independent anomalous dimensions with certain very special ( ` convexity ' ) properties @xcite .",
    "in contrast , analogous infinite sets of fields can not exists in ` conventional ' , non - random phase transitions .",
    "( in 2d , for example , such clean phase transitions are known to possess only a finite number of independent anomalous dimensions@xcite . ) on one hand , the multifractal scaling properties of wave functions at the 2d iqh plateau transition and at the 2d symplectic class metal - insulator transition have been calculated numerically to high precision @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the entire multifractal spectrum has been obtained analytically for dirac fermions in random gauge potentials@xcite while the first few multifractal wave function moments have been calculated analytically for the spin quantum hall transition@xcite .    the aforementioned properties , while being important characteristics of the ld critical points , do not exhaust all their important universal physics .",
    "it is well known that even for non - random , conventional phase transitions , the geometry of the system has a crucial effect on the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "critical exponents as well as correlation functions depend on the overall geometry and the location where these quantities are measured .",
    "in particular , correlation functions of quantities located near the boundary of the system exhibit in general different scaling behavior@xcite as compared to bulk correlation functions ( and this depends in general also on the imposed boundary conditions ) . these aspects can be studied in great detail especially in the case of critical 2d systems which are conformally invariant @xcite .",
    "these ideas thus emphasize the importance of boundary effects in ld transitions , particularly in 2d where these transitions are believed to be in general described by conformally invariant fixed points ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the sqh transition , being analytically tractable , provides us with a playground where we can understand the effect of both multifractality and boundary criticality at ld transitions . in the process",
    "we are led to a more general framework where one considers multifractal behavior of wave functions near boundaries , giving rise to the notion of ` _ surface ( boundary ) multifractality _ ' .",
    "the power of conformal invariance enables us to extend this idea to more complicated geometrical settings . in the present paper",
    "we derive several exact exponents characterizing these properties for the sqh transition .",
    "to summarize our main results , we note that within a second - quantized formulation of the conventional chalker - coddington network model for the sqh transition@xcite , a reflecting boundary ( where the system simply ends ) preserves the full sl@xmath2 supersymmmetry present in the disorder - averaged bulk problem .",
    "after the mapping@xcite to bond percolation this amounts to a reflecting boundary condition for the perimeters ( hulls ) of the percolation clusters .",
    "here we express correlation functions characterizing wave function multifractality in terms of the generators of the underlying sl@xmath2 supersymmmetry algebra . using the representation theory of this superalgebra together with the percolation mapping we are able to convert the correlation functions to classical percolation probabilities .",
    "using previously known scaling exponents for percolation we are able to calculate two non - trivial multifractal exponents , conventionally denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , both on the boundary and in the bulk , within the supersymmetry approach developed in ref .  .",
    "( the values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , _ in the bulk _ had been obtained in refs .   and using methods very different from the supersymmetry methods used in the present paper . ) the inability to calculate higher multifractal moments",
    "is explained within our ( supersymmetry ) formulation .",
    "the scaling behavior of the averaged local density of states and point - contact conductance are also found at the boundary . using suitable conformal invariance arguments , we are able to translate the boundary ( ` surface ' ) exponents to a wedge geometry and find the corresponding corner exponents ( see section [ other geometries ] for the various exact values ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ physicsc ]",
    "we briefly present the physics of the sqh effect . in section [ sqh network model ] , we discuss the supersymmetry ( susy ) formulation of the chalker - coddington network model for the sqh transition in the presence of boundaries . in section [ multifractal exponents ] ,",
    "we elucidate how supersymmetry in the sqh problem can be used to study ( low - order ) multifractal wave function moments , both near boundaries and in the bulk .",
    "( as mentioned above , exponents of low - order multifractal moments in the _ bulk _ have been obtained previously in ref .",
    "using very different methods . )",
    "we also explain , using the supersymmetry approach , following ref .",
    ", the technical reasons why this computation can be done only for low multifractal moments ( up to the third power of the wave function intensity ) and not for the whole multifractal spectrum . the reasons appear to be different from , and complementary to the ones discussed in ref . .",
    "in section [ therm & trans exponents ] we discuss the scaling behavior of the local density of states and of the point contact conductance near a boundary . in section [ other geometries ] , we extend our discussion to more complicated geometries . in the final section ,",
    "we conclude by discussing certain implications of our results and a number of remaining open issues .",
    "some of the results derived in the present paper were announced in the letter ref .  .",
    "the spin quantum hall ( sqh ) transition was first studied , numerically , in ref .  .",
    "a simple physical picture of the sqh effect was given in ref .  .",
    "in this section we briefly review , for completeness , the basic physics of the sqh effect .",
    "let us consider a lattice version of the bcs hamiltonian describing a singlet superconductor ( classes c or ci in the notation of refs .   and ):",
    "@xmath5 the first term here describes ( in a second - quantized language ) hopping of electrons of either spin @xmath6 between lattice sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as possible on - site potentials ( for @xmath9 ) .",
    "the other two terms describe bcs singlet pairing . provided that the gap function satisfies @xmath10 , the hamiltonian ( [ bcsham ] ) is su(2 ) invariant and commutes with the three generators of the global su(2 ) spin rotations ( total spin ) : @xmath11    being the hamiltonian of a superconductor , eq .",
    "( [ bcsham ] ) does not conserve the particle number , or charge .",
    "physically this is due to the existence of the pair condensate which may exchange electrons into holes in processes similar to andreev reflection .",
    "not being a conserved quantum number , the quasiparticle charge can not be transported by diffusion .",
    "consequently , there is no notion of electrical ( charge- ) conductivity .",
    "however , the spin of each quasiparticle is conserved by the hamiltonian , and one may define the spin conductivity as the linear response coefficient between the ( say ) @xmath12-component of the spin current and the gradient of a zeeman field along the @xmath12 direction : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath15 is the bohr magneton .    when the gap function @xmath16 is complex , time - reversal symmetry is broken , and then the hall ( transverse ) spin conductivity @xmath17 may be non - vanishing .",
    "it is convenient to perform a particle - hole transformation on the down - spin particles : @xmath18 under this transformation the @xmath12 component of the generator of spin rotations ( [ gens ] ) becomes simply the total number of @xmath19-particles , @xmath20 .",
    "thus the transformation interchanges the role of particle number and @xmath12 component of spin , with the result that the transformed hamiltonian conserves the number of @xmath19 particles : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the so called bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian , a @xmath23 matrix in the spin space : @xmath24 since the @xmath19-particle number is conserved we can use a single - particle description .",
    "the external non - random zeeman field @xmath25 in the @xmath12 direction , in this alternative description maps onto a simple shift @xmath26 in the fermi energy as @xmath27 the spin conductivity in the original problem becomes the usual electrical ( charge ) conductivity of the @xmath19 particles .",
    "note that the role of the elementary charge is now played by @xmath28 , so that the natural quantum of the spin conductivity is @xmath29 . in what follows we use units in which @xmath30 .",
    "invariance of the hamiltonian in eq . under the global su(2 )",
    "symmetry implies the following property of the matrix @xmath22 in eq . ,",
    "@xmath31 which has important consequences .",
    "firstly , it implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath22 always appear in pairs as @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "the single particle energy spectrum is symmetric about @xmath33 .",
    "the ground state of the problem is obtained by filling up all the negative energy ( @xmath19- ) single particle states .",
    "the positive energy ( @xmath19- ) particle and hole excitations on top of this ground state are doublets under the global su(2 ) symmetry . a zeeman term , or non - zero energy shift ( see eq .",
    "( [ eb ] ) ) , breaks the global su(2 ) symmetry and splits the degeneracy between the above - mentioned ( @xmath19- ) particle and hole states .",
    "secondly , eq .",
    "( [ bdgsymm ] ) implies a relation between the retarded and advanced green s functions of the bdg hamiltonian or the corresponding network model , ( see eq .",
    "below ) .    a clean ( that is non - random ) @xmath34 -wave superconductor ( which breaks time - reversal symmetry )",

    ", there can be two possible localized phases  spin insulator , and sqh phase ,  distinguished topologically by the quantized value of the spin hall conductivity .",
    "a transition between them , the generic sqh transition , is a localization - delocalization transition similar to the iqh plateau transition , where @xmath17 jumps by two units .",
    "it is a quantum percolation transition @xcite of the edge states forming@xcite at the interfaces between two topologically distinct regions .",
    "there is one essential difference between the sqh and the iqh case . in the latter case , the mean single - particle density of states is non - vanishing on either side and at the transition . in the sqh case ,",
    "on the other hand , the density of states of @xmath19-particles , @xmath40 , vanishes at zero energy , @xmath33 , in both localized phases@xcite as @xmath41 ; right at the transition , that is at @xmath33 , it vanishes ( as might have been expected ) with a non - trivial exponent : @xmath42 the exponent @xmath43 was calculated exactly in ref .   to be @xmath44 . in section [ therm & trans exponents ] below",
    "we will present a derivation of this result , as well as its analogue for the local density of states at a boundary of the sqh system .",
    "network models have been very convenient for both numerical and analytical work on various disordered non - interacting fermion problems .",
    "the best known such model is the chalker - coddington ( cc ) network model @xcite for the integer quantum hall plateau transition .",
    "similar network models can be constructed for other localization problems , including the chiral metal @xcite , the sqh transition @xcite , the random bond ising model and the thermal quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "the sqh network consists of a lattice of directed links and two types of nodes , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , forming a square lattice ( see fig . [ network ] ) on which spin-@xmath47 particles at energy @xmath48 can propagate .",
    "uni - directional propagation through each link is represented by a random su@xmath49 matrix . as in the case of cc network , to study the critical behavior at the sqh transition it is sufficient to introduce disorder only for propagation along the links , while all the nodes can be taken to have the same ( non - random ) scattering matrices .",
    "the node scattering matrices are diagonal in the spin indices : @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 labels whether the node is on the @xmath45 or the @xmath46 sublattice , and @xmath53 labels the spin - index of the propagating particle .",
    "apart from the case of boundary nodes ( which will be treated in detail later ) , the remaining network is isotropic ( invariant under 90 degree rotation of the lattice ) when the scattering amplitudes on the two sublattice nodes are related by @xmath54 .    .",
    "the black circles on the links represent the random su(2 ) scattering matrices . ]    the critical point of the isotropic network is located at @xmath55 .",
    "varying @xmath56 while keeping @xmath57 and @xmath58 drives the system between a spin insulator and a sqh state and the spin hall conductance jumps from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . taking @xmath61 breaks the global su@xmath49 symmetry and splits the transition into two ordinary iqh transitions each in the unitary symmetry class ( investigated , for example , in ref .  ) . in this paper",
    "we consider only the spin - rotation invariant case with @xmath62 .",
    "network models can be studied using either a first quantized or a second quantized formalism .",
    "the first quantized method is adopted in refs .   and .",
    "it is also very useful for numerical work .",
    "here we use it to derive certain symmetry relations .",
    "the rest of the paper will employ the second quantized formalism ( see next section ) .",
    "all physical quantities of interest in our problem such as wave function correlators and conductance can be expressed in terms of the green s functions .",
    "usually , the latter are represented in continuous time notation , but the network models use the discrete time analogs . in particular , network models use a single step time - evolution operator @xmath63 which acts on the single particle wave function @xmath64 at discrete time @xmath65 to give the wave function at time @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes a link of the network . for a network with @xmath68 links , @xmath63 is ( due to the spin - index ) a @xmath69 matrix , which represents a finite - time version of the infinitesimal time - evolution operator .",
    "thus @xmath70 @xmath71 where the hamiltonian @xmath72 ( which describes the time evolution of the edge states separating ` puddles ' of topologically distinct regions ) has the same symmetry properties as the underlying bdg hamiltonian in eq . (",

    "the above equation will turn out to be crucial for our calculations since it implies that we need not introduce separate operators for the advanced sector green s functions but can work solely with retarded ones ( as we will see below ) .",
    "all network models can also be studied using the second - quantized susy technique@xcite .",
    "the second - quantization of the sqh network is decribed in ref .",

    "usually one needs two types of bosons and fermions , ` retarded ' and ` advanced ' , to be able to obtain two - particle properties ( that is averages of products of retarded and advanced green s functions ) relevant for the calculation of transport properties .",
    "however , the symmetry relation in eq . relates retarded and advanced green s functions . hence ,",
    "as it turns out , for the computation of low enough moments of , say , retarded green s functions , we need only one fermion and one boson per spin direction per link of a row .",

    "we will consider below correlation functions of operators in the network model in the vicinity of the sqh transition .",
    "when using continuum notation one needs to recall@xcite that , in general , operators acquire additional singularities when approaching a boundary ; they may vanish or diverge . by saying that points lie on the boundary",
