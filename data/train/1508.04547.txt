    "the effects arising upon adsorption of @xmath0 conjugated molecules on metal substrates are of great interest due to their importance in organic electronics . the ability to identify electronic states with specific molecular orbitals and to determine their energy ordering is vital to the understanding of overlayer / substrate systems .",
    "this can be particularly difficult for strong chemisorptive interactions where significant broadening or level splitting occurs or when intermolecular dispersing bands are formed . in the last decade _",
    "ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations , particulary within density functional theory ( dft ) , have become almost indispensable in the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "however , it is becoming recognized that dft results can be misleading owing to approximations for exchange - correlation effects which may severely affect predicted adsorption geometries and/or the electronic structure of organic / metal interfaces @xcite .",
    "the pentacene / cu interface is such a case . despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies ,",
    "there is as yet no consensus on the orbital assignment .",
    "here we demonstrate how the angle resolved photoemission ( arups ) technique , that is becoming known as orbital tomography @xcite , can provide a definitive assignment of the emissions even for strongly interacting extended two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems and give insight into the nature of dispersion and hybridization .",
    "the pentacene ( 5a ) monolayer on cu(110 ) has been extensively studied . from their arups investigations seki et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that selection rule arguments can not explain the photoemission behavior and suggested strong hybridization with the substrate could be modifying the orbital symmetry @xcite .",
    "they also suggested the appearance of dispersing , interface - induced states arising from substrate interactions @xcite .",
    "ferretti et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the possibility that the mixing of 5a molecular orbitals with the cu substrate leads to  interaction states localized at the interface ",
    ", where their calculations suggest partial occupation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) whose symmetry might not be directly related to the original molecular state . on the same cu(119 ) vicinal surface , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images also suggest partial occupation of the lumo and dispersive electronic states associated with a perturbed electron charge density distribution .",
    "@xcite also a recent combined dft and arups study of the 5a / cu(110 ) system concludes that only partial lumo occupation takes place @xcite .",
    "the simple relationship between the angular distribution of the photoemission current and the fourier transform of the emitting molecular orbital has been shown to be reasonable for a number of molecular adsorbate systems on various noble metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "this allows molecular orientations to be determined @xcite , molecular orbital energy ordering to be deduced @xcite and even the reconstruction of the molecular orbitals in real space @xcite . for these systems , the angular - dependent emissions",
    "can essentially be accounted for by the photoemission from isolated molecules , thus intermolecular orbital overlap plays a minor role . however , in extended 2d overlayer systems , a description in terms of isolated molecular orbitals is no longer strictly appropriate . here , with the comparison between pentacene monolayers on ag(110 ) and cu(110 ) ,",
    "we show how orbital tomography and the fourier transform description can be applied to extended systems with strongly dispersing emissions . in so doing , we provide a definitive description of the 5a / cu arups and show that the lumo is in fact fully occupied and displays a substrate - induced dispersion which is significantly larger than that reported for similar organic overlayer systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike all previous tomography studies we here show evidence for a modification of orbital shape on adsorption .",
    "photoemission experiments were performed at bessyii using a toroidal electron - energy analyzer described previously @xcite which was attached to the beamline u125/2-sgm of the synchrotron radiation facility bessy ii , helmholtz - zentrum - berlin .",
    "photon energies of 30 and 35 ev and an incidence angle of @xmath1 = 40@xmath2 with respect to the surface normal were used .",
    "the polarization direction is in the specular plane , which also contains the photoelectron trajectory measured .",
    "emitted photoelectrons are recorded simultaneously with polar angles @xmath3 of @xmath4 to @xmath5 with respect to the surface normal in an energy window of 1 ev .",
    "the energy window is divided into 40 individual slices which goes well below the analyzer s intrinsic energy resolution of 150 mev .",
    "note , however , for the presented momentum maps we take only the data from the side of the emission direction that is pointing in the orientation of the electric field vector of the incident photons , this is referred to as the positive side ( see fig .  [ figs1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath3 = 0@xmath2 to + 80@xmath2 .",
    "this maximizes the polarization factor appearing in the photocurrent cross section ( see eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] ) .",
    "it is noted that the molecular features are enhanced relative to the substrate emissions on the positive side ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) . to obtain the full ( k@xmath6 , k@xmath7 ) range for the presented momentum maps at constant binding energy , azimuthal scans",
    "are made by rotating the sample around the surface normal in 1@xmath2 steps for an azimuthal angle range @xmath8 and then imposing the substrate s twofold symmetry to obtain the full 360@xmath2 .",
    "the angular emission data are then converted to parallel momentum components k@xmath6 and k@xmath7 using the relation @xmath9    @xmath10    to create the momentum maps .",
    "the cu(110 ) and ag(110 ) substrates were prepared in the conventional way by a sequence of sputter - annealing cycles .",
    "5a molecules were evaporated from an effusion cell onto the surfaces at room temperature with the amount monitored by a microbalance .",
    "the resulting monolayer leed structures are @xmath11 for pentacene on ag(110 ) and @xmath12 for pentacene on cu(110 ) . in both cases",
    "mild annealing improved the order . on cu(110 )",
    "the monolayer was annealed at 200@xmath2c which is above the 5a sublimation temperature whereas on ag(110 ) the molecule substrate bond is weaker and the annealing temperature must not exceed 140@xmath2c so as not to desorb from the monolayer .",

    "we note , however , that this change is smaller than the experimental observation .",
    "the discrepancy is likely due to a shortcoming of the dft results regarding the lumo binding energy ( too low ) and width ( too narrow ) at the hse - dft level indicating an underestimation of the interaction strength of the lumo with the substrate .",
    "the pronounced difference between the minor lobe peak position of 5a / cu(110 ) compared to 5a / ag(110 ) can thus be seen as direct evidence for a strong molecule - metal hybridization for the former .    while hybridization is generally observed by indirect means in effects on molecular emissions such as energy broadening of orbital emissions @xcite or reduced emission intensity in gaps of bulk states @xcite , we here provide direct evidence for changes in orbital shape .",
    "moreover , further signatures of hybridization can be observed as additional cu-@xmath56-like features appearing with the overlayer periodicity ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these are best seen on the _ negative _ @xmath20 side where the molecular features are weak as shown in fig .",
    "these emissions are not simply the bulk @xmath56 bands scattered by the overlayer since mere scattering would replicate the cu @xmath56 band over the entire energy range .",
    "instead one observes that they do not extend up to @xmath54 but stop at 1.2 ev binding energy , just below the onset of the lumo orbital .",
    "we therefore suggest they are due to interfacial cu @xmath56 bands hybridizing with the 5a lumo such that states appearing in these bands in the 01 ev binding energy range have changed their character from cu @xmath56 to that of the molecular lumo .",
    "in summary , a very strong substrate - induced dispersion of the lumo orbital of 5a / cu(110 ) along the cu - row direction is traced back to a significant hybridization between the organic and the metallic states , while the lumo of 5a / ag(110 ) exhibits only a minor intermolecular dispersion . by making use of the reciprocal relation between the structure of real space orbitals and features in the momentum maps ,",
    "we are able to deduce a significant geometrical modification of the lumo orbital upon adsorption on cu(110 ) , while it remains essentially free - molecule like on ag(110 ) .",
    "we believe that the main difference between the adsorption behavior of pentacene on these two surfaces arises from the distinct molecular orientation with respect to the close - packed metal rows .",
    "while on ag(110 ) pentacene orients perpendicular to the rows , it aligns parallel to the metal rows on cu(110 ) .",
    "because the electronic structure , e.g. the band dispersion of the metallic @xmath56-bands or the location of the surface state in the surface brillouin zone , is distinctly different along the rows @xmath65 $ ] and perpendicular to them @xmath66 $ ] , also the hybridization with adsorbed elongated species can be expected to be different .    in conclusion , for the case of pentacene monolayers on ag(110 ) and cu(110 ) surfaces , we have demonstrated the power of the orbital - tomography method using extensive angle - resolved photoemission data for revealing the electronic structure of such two - dimensional organic - metal interfacial layers . by generalizing the theoretical description of the photoemission process from isolated molecule systems to extended two - dimensional systems , we are able to explain the  fine - structure  in the experimental momentum maps and obtain a comprehensive understanding of the band dispersion of organic - metal interfacial layers .",
