    "after decades of neutrino oscillation experiments , the mixing pattern in the lepton sector has been well established  @xcite .",
    "there are one small and two large mixing angles , and two mass - squared differences that differ by a factor of 30 in the neutrino sector .",
    "numerous neutrino mixing scenarios have been proposed in the literature to explain such a nontrivial mixing pattern ; for a recent review , see ref .",
    "the most attractive scenarios are those with mixing patterns motivated by simple symmetries , such as tri - bimaximal mixing  @xcite , bimaximal mixing  @xcite , and golden ratio mixing  @xcite .",
    "all three mixing scenarios have @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and are a subset of the more general @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , recent measurements of @xmath3 by short - baseline reactor experiments daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite , double chooz  @xcite , and long - baseline accelerator experiments",
    "t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite strongly disfavor @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , models with simple symmetries need additional features to explain the observed neutrino mixing pattern .    a modified approach to explain the data is to treat the simple mixing scenarios as the underlying model and add perturbations to accommodate the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we took @xmath0 symmetry ( in the charged lepton basis ) , as the underlying model , and added real perturbations to the majorana neutrino mass matrices to explain the data .",
    "we found that small perturbations can cause large corrections to @xmath4 , and the experimental data can be explained by most @xmath0 symmetric mixing scenarios with perturbations of similar magnitude .    after the discovery that the mixing angle @xmath3 is relatively large , many scenarios without @xmath0 symmetry have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , and by the fact that real perturbations have no effect on the dirac and majorana phases , in this paper we consider arbitrary initial mixing for the underlying model and generalize the perturbation results to the complex space . under the assumption that the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , we derive analytic formulas for the leading - order ( lo ) corrections to the three mixing angles and the dirac and majorana phases .",
    "we find that the phases of the elements of the perturbation matrix , and the initial values of the dirac and majorana phases , strongly impact the lo corrections to the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "we also perform a numerical study of complex perturbations on initial neutrino mass matrices with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we find that the dirac phase can take any value under small perturbations for experimentally compatible scenarios .",
    "since the mixings in both the charged lepton sector and neutrino sector contribute to the observed pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , we explore the case in which the charged lepton mass matrix is not diagonal , and consider small complex perturbations to the charged lepton mass matrix as well .",
    "since the initial mixing matrix in the charged lepton sector is unconstrained , small perturbations in the charged lepton sector could have large effects on the 1 - 2 mixing in the charged lepton sector , which lead to large changes in the mixing angles and phases in the pmns matrix .",
    "in addition , as an application of our generalized perturbation procedure , we study neutrino oscillations with matter effects from both nonstandard scalar and nonstandard vector interactions .",
    "nonstandard scalar interactions add small perturbations to the neutrino mass matrix , which yield corrections to the vacuum mixing angles and mass - squared differences . by using our formalism ,",
    "we demonstrate how expressions for neutrino oscillation probabilities that simultaneously depend on nonstandard scalar and nonstandard vector interactions , can be obtained .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we work in the diagonal charged lepton basis and derive analytic formulas for the mixing parameters that result from real and complex perturbations . in section  3 , we perform a numerical analysis of complex perturbations to neutrino mass matrices with @xmath0 symmetry . in section  4 , we calculate corrections to the three mixing angles and phases in the pmns matrix from perturbations in the charged lepton sector . in section  5",
    ", we apply our perturbation results to study neutrino oscillations with both nonstandard scalar and nonstandard vector interactions .",
    "we summarize our results in section  6 .",
    "our goal in this section is to obtain the lo corrections to all the physical parameters under small perturbations on the initial majorana neutrino mass matrix assuming the charged lepton mass matrix to be diagonal .",
