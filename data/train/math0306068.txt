    "quandle cohomology theory was developed @xcite to define invariants of classical knots and knotted surfaces in state - sum form , called quandle cocycle ( knot ) invariants .",
    "the quandle cohomology theory is a modification of rack cohomology theory which was defined in @xcite , and studied from different perspectives .",
    "the cocycle knot invariants are analogous in their definitions to the dijkgraaf - witten invariants @xcite of triangulated @xmath1-manifolds with finite gauge groups , but they use quandle knot colorings as spins and cocycles as boltzmann weights .",
    "two types of topological applications of cocycle knot invariants have been established and are being investigated actively : non - invertibility @xcite and the minimal triple point numbers @xcite of knotted surfaces .",
    "a knot is _ non - invertible _ if it is not equivalent to itself with the orientation reversed while the the orientation of the space preserved . in both applications ,",
    "quandle cocycle invariants produced results that are not obtained by other known methods ; specifically , all known methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) of proving non - invertibility of knotted surfaces do not apply directly to non - spherical knots ( except kawauchi s @xcite generalization of the farber - levine pairing , and it is not clear how this can be applied or how computations can be implemented for given examples ) , while quandle cocycle invariants can be applied to orientable surfaces of any genus .",
    "thus the cocycle invariants are the only method available in detecting non - invertibility that can be applied regardless of genus .",
    "furthermore concrete methods to compute these have been implemented via computers .",
    "the triple point numbers ( the minimal number of triple points in projections ) have been determined for some knotted surfaces for the first time by using the quandle cocycle invariants .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the quandle cocycle invariants in three different directions , using generalizations of quandle homology theory provided by andruskiewitsch and graa @xcite .",
    "the original and the generalized quandle homology theories can be compared to group cohomology theories , with trivial and non - trivial group actions on coefficient groups , respectively .",
    "thus the generalization of the homology theory and knot invariants are substantial and essential ; the original case is only the very special case when the action is trivial .",
    "examples in wreath product of groups are given in section  [ extsec ] after preliminaries are provided in section  [ prelimsec ] .",
    "algebraic aspects of these examples are also studied .",
    "the three directions of generalizations are as follows .",
    "first , the actions of quandle modules ( defined below ) are regarded as generalizations of the burau representation of braid groups .",
    "thus we define invariants for classical knots , in section  [ qmodinvsec ] , using such quandle modules , in a similar manner as alexander modules are defined from burau representations .",
    "second , quandle @xmath0-cocycles with non - abelian coefficients are used to define invariants for classical knots , defined in a similar manner as invariants defined from hopf algebras @xcite , by sliding beads on knot diagrams , in section  [ nonabsec ] .",
    "generalizations of quandle cocycle invariants are given for classical knots in section  [ cocyinvsec ] and for knotted surfaces in section  [ knottedsfcesec ] , respectively .",
    "computational methods , examples , and applications are provided .",
    "the invariant for the classical knots detect chirality of the @xmath1-colorable knots through @xmath2-crossings . as a main application of the invariant for knotted surfaces ,",
    "we show that majority of @xmath3-twist spun of @xmath1-colorable knots in the classical knot table up to @xmath2 crossings , as well as surfaces obtained from them by attaching trivial @xmath4-handles , are non - invertible .",
