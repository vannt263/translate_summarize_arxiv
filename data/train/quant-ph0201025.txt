    "entanglement in the ground state of the heisenberg model has been discussed previously @xcite . in an earlier note @xcite we presented an analytical study of pairwise entanglement in the 3-qubit heisenberg model in a _ uniform _ magnetic field and found that the magnetic field can greatly enhance pairwise entanglement .",
