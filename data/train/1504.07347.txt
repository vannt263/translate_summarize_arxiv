    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) is a widely used technique to follow the dynamics of a gravitationally interacting gas .",
    "a notable advantage of sph is that the resolution automatically increases with sph particles concentrating in dense regions .",
    "nevertheless , in simulations of some hydrodynamical problems such as prestellar gas cloud collapse , one typically needs to follow a density evolution over too many orders of magnitude . in the central densest region",
    ", sph particles would eventually violate a resolution requirement .",
    "@xcite argue that a local jeans length needs to be resolved by several grid cells at any time in a grid based hydrodynamics simulation . for a sph simulation with the number of the neighbor particles @xmath2 and the particle mass @xmath3 , the resolution criterion may be written as @xmath4 ,",
    "where @xmath5 is the minimal mass resolved by the sph particles , and @xmath6 is the jeans mass at the region with the sound speed @xmath7 and the density @xmath8 . given a critical mass ratio @xmath9 , one can determine the maximal particle mass required to resolve each simulated region .",
    "insufficient mass resolution results in producing artificial features such as smoothed round shape , and often triggers unphysical fragmentation @xcite . besides , it is costly to perform simulations with a uniform , and sufficiently high mass resolution so that the entire simulation region is fully resolved throughout the run .    to save the computational time and memory , multi - step zoom - in techniques",
    "have been developed .",
    "mesh refinement can be done in a conceptually simple manner in grid - based simulations , where the cell division procedure can be systematically defined . in adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations , for example , an initially large cell can be progressively refined with just smaller size rectangular cells . on the other hand , refinement of sph particles",
    "is not trivial .",
    "a promising refinement technique for sph simulations is particle splitting .",
    "a coarse parent particle which is about to violate certain resolution criteria is replaced with a number of finer daughter particles . a simple way of particle splitting is to distribute daughter particles within the smoothing length @xmath10 of the parent particle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the splitting method of @xcite ( hereafter , kw02 ) is widely used in the simulations of the super - massive blackhole formation @xcite and of primordial star formation @xcite .",
    "the kw02 method distributes thirteen daughters on a hexagonal closest packing array at a distance @xmath11 from the central particle .",
    "one of the daughters is located the same coordinate as the parent , and the angular orientation of the twelve daughters is randomly determined .",
    "since there are , by definition , @xmath2 particles within @xmath10 , it can happen that a daughter particle is placed very close to one of the neighboring particles by chance .",
    "this can result in significant overestimation of the local density .",
    "also the fine anisotropic structures with sizes less than @xmath12 tend to be smoothed out by imposing the spherical distribution on the daughter particles .",
    "figure [ fig : demo2d ] illustrates an example particle distribution .",
    "the left panel shows the two - dimensional coordinates of the daughters generated by the central coarse particle . after splitting with a random angle orientation",
    ", several daughters ( red dots ) happen to be close to neighbors ( black dots ) within the smoothing kernel ( orange - shaded region ) .",
    "in addition , daughters distributed in the originally underdense region can spuriously boost the local density estimate .    the density perturbations would be mitigated or would cause only local effects if the daughter particles are placed in the region dominated essentially by a single parent particle .",
    "along this idea , @xcite ( mes06 ) present a method in which the daughter particles are placed on the vertices of the cube centered at a target parent particle with the cube side - length being the half inter - particle distance .",
    "we here explore yet another , and an elegant space partitioning method based on the voronoi tessellation .",
    "a voronoi cell is defined as a set of the points closest to each particle .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : demo2d ] illustrates our scheme of particle splitting in two dimension .",
    "the daughter particles ( red dots ) are distributed within a voronoi cell ( defined by the black lines ) .",
    "they are expected to reproduce the original density structure of the coarse parent particles .",
    "a nice feature of the method is that the refinement can be done in a systematic manner for the given distribution of the original coarse particles .",
    "a number of advantages of using the voronoi tessellation have been shown in previous studies .",
    "for example , a moving mesh code arepo @xcite and a mesh - free code gizmo @xcite implement the particle refinement based on the voronoi tessellation .    in the present paper",
    ", we first apply the particle splitting based on the voronoi diagrams to sph simulations .",
    "we examine how our method improves the effective resolution while preserving original density structures , compared with a conventional splitting method of kw02 by several tests . as a realistic application",
    ", we perform simulations of gravitational collapse of a primordial gas cloud with two splitting methods .",
    "we construct the voronoi diagram as follows . in our scheme , the voronoi cell for each particle is obtained .",
    "we set a cube of size @xmath13 centered at a target parent particle as a first trial voronoi cell .",
    "the cube is then cut by a perpendicular bisector of a line segment which connects the central particle and each particle in the cube .",
    "after the cube is cut by all the bisectors , we obtain the voronoi cell .",
    "let us call this procedure the facet - cut algorithm . initially the cube size is set as @xmath14 .",
    "particles outside the initial cube but closer to the central particle than @xmath15 can define the final shape of the voronoi cell , where @xmath16 is the maximal distance between the central particle and the vertices of the voronoi cell .",
    "if @xmath16 is larger than @xmath17 , we enlarge the initial cube and repeat the facet - cut algorithm .",
    "this algorithm scales as @xmath18@xmath19 for the number of split particles @xmath20 , with a weak dependence on the distribution of the particles .",
    "there are various possibilities to determine the coordinates and mass of the daughter particles .",
    "basically , the daughter particles of a single parent are desired to be well separated to each other and to have a nearly equal mass .",
    "figure [ fig : split_demo_2d ] shows an example set of the daughter particles .",
    "we split the voronoi cell of the central parent particle ( blue dot ) into small subcells defined by the blue dotted lines .",
    "a subcell corresponds to each voronoi vertex .",
    "a daughter is then placed at the center of mass of each subcell . in this way",
    ", we can realize an approximately equal mass distribution of the daughter particles .",
    "we extend the above procedure to three - dimensional cases .",
    "figure [ fig : split_demo_3d ] illustrates our procedure .",
    "we begin with the configuration given in the panel ( a ) .",
    "we first draw a boundaries of subcells on each voronoi plane by the blue dotted line between the two points @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath21 is the center of mass of the voronoi plane , and @xmath22 is the middle point of the voronoi edge .",
    "we then define the base planes of the subcell corresponding to a vertex @xmath23 as the orange - colored region .",
    "the whole shape of the subcell is defined as the polyhedron surrounded by the blue dotted lines in the panel ( b ) .",
    "the polyhedron consists of the base planes with the thick blue - dotted lines in the panel ( b ) , which is the same as the orange region in the panel ( a ) , and the target parent particle ( blue dot in the panel ( b ) ) .",
    "next , we merge the subcells whose corresponding vertices are connected by the shortest edges .",
    "we perform this merging procedure in order not to have daughter particles significantly close to each other .",
    "a voronoi cell in 3d typically has 2030 vertices .",
    "if the number of the voronoi vertices is more than ten , we repeatedly merge the closest subcells until the total number is reduced to ten . at this point",
    "we obtain a nearly uniform distribution of the daughters .",
    "we choose the threshold number @xmath24 , because we do not want to have a huge mass difference between the parent and the daughters .",
    "refinement by a factor of ten is a reasonable choice .",
    "we have actually performed an additional simulation in which subcells are not merged and have confirmed that the results are not significantly affected by the threshold number .",
    "we finally put a daughter particle at the center of mass of each ( merged ) subcell as shown by the red dot in the panel ( b ) .",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ fig : split_demo_3d ] is a stereogram showing the distribution of the ten daughters ( red dots ) generated around the parent ( blue dot ) .",
    "we equally divide the mass of the parent particle into @xmath25 .",
    "we give the daughters the same temperature as that of the parent .",
    "the velocity of the parent particle is simply assigned to the daughters so that the linear momentum and kinetic energy are strictly conserved .",
    "the daughters are given half the integration timestep of their parent as a temporal value after splitting , but the individual integration timestep is recalculated for the new set of particles in the next timestep .",
    "we perform three test simulations to examine the splitting methods of the previous study ( sphere ) and ours ( voro ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in how the new density field after splitting differs from the original density field represented by the parent particles . in the following tests ,",
    "we use the sph code gadget-2 @xcite supplemented with the parallelized algorithms of the voronoi tessellation and the particle splitting .",
    "all the control parameters are set to be the default values of gadget-2.0.7 . to determine the sph kernel size , we fix the number of the neighbor particles to @xmath26 . the densities of sph particles",
    "are calculated in the standard manner using the cubic spline kernel .",

    "@xcite perform the three - dimensional simulations and conclude that such cloud fragments if the initial amplitude is larger than 0.15 . in the bb79 test",
    ", we run simulations with the minimal mass resolutions @xmath39 , 10 , and 100 . for @xmath39 and 10",
    ", artificial fragmentation occurs for the lack of the resolution as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we here show the results for @xmath40 .",
    "we perform three runs and compare them . in the run nosp , we distribute a very large number of particles ( @xmath41 ) to satisfy the jeans criterion @xmath42 until the gas density reaches @xmath43 , where the gas would become optically thick . in the runs sphere and voro",

    "the maximal and minimal densities just after the particle splitting are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the maximal deviations of the density from the original value 1 are reduced more than by a factor of two by our splitting method . the density deviation relative to the mean density just after the splitting also decreases from 0.33 ( sphere ) to 0.15 ( voro ) , approaching to the initial value of 0.037 .",
    "the result shows that , also in the practical collapse simulation , the daughter particles distributed in a voronoi cell of each split particle are not close to other neighbor particles , and their density is not significantly overestimated , while this happens with the conventional splitting method .    in this bb79 test , the density structure is not very different between sphere and voro , showing an interesting contrast to our test grad that is more relevant to a primordial warm gas ( see section [ subsec : grad ] ) .",

    "we see that the temperature significantly fluctuates along the adiabatic line @xmath72 from the splitting points for sphere .",
    "since the gas cooling and heating do not work promptly within a short timestep , the temperatures of daughters deviate along the adiabatic line when their densities are perturbed from the parent s density one timestep after splitting .",

    "the white lines in figure [ fig : mh_nt ] indicate the expected trajectories , i.e. , the gas particles having the lowest temperature at each density would evolve roughly on the white line without the particle splitting .",

    "the distributions of particles on the density - temperature planes are not significantly different for two splitting methods sphere and voro .",
    "we find that substantial differences are caused in the global structure by the two different splitting methods .",
    "figure [ fig : mh_snapshots ] shows the snapshots of the gas cloud at the central density @xmath73 . comparing the middle panels , we find that the spiral arms have more developed in voro than in sphere .",

    "the temperature deviates along with the density perturbation generated by the particle splitting as figure [ fig : mh_nt ] shows .",
    "some particles are overcooled and might trigger the artificial fragmentation by their small pressure , but this would not be in the case .",

    "we divide the gas particles into hot ( orange ) and cool ( blue ) components respectively above and under the white line in figure [ fig : mh_nt ] .",
    "the blue dots indicate the overcooled gas .",
    "if the overcooled gas particles cluster , they might trigger the fragmentation by their small pressure .",
    "however , the cool gas particles apparently scatter in all directions for sphere ( upper panel ) . for voro , although the cool component appears to cluster at longitude @xmath90 , where a spiral arm lies , the hot gas particles are also in the arm region and would prevent the collapse of the cool component .",
    "the local perturbations of temperature and density triggered by the particle splitting would not affect the gas fragmentation irrespective of the splitting methods .",
    "on the other hand , the global density structure such as spiral arms and bars can affect the gravitational stability of the gas . as seen in figure [ fig : mh_snapshots ]",
    ", the high - density region remains strongly elongated in voro run .",
    "although the long - time evolution of the spiral arms is not followed in our simulations , we can derive a reasonable estimate on whether or not the disk is stable by calculating the toomre @xmath86 parameter @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the column density in each part on the disk .",
    "figure [ fig : mh_q ] shows the distribution of @xmath86 parameter .",

    "the distribution of @xmath86 parameter is shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : mh_q ] .",
    "the elongation of the central core is slightly smaller than our method voro .",
    "the inner structure of the spiral arms is resolved as well as voro , but the density structure appears slightly more diffuse . this is likely because of the nature of the method of cube , where the daughter particles are distributed on the vertices of the cube around a parent , and the original density structure formed by parent particles are slightly smoothed in the directions both perpendicular and parallel to the disk .",
    "the column density in the spiral arms for the run cube is less than voro , and the resulting minimal @xmath86 parameter is 0.58 .",
    "the linear analysis of the ring - mode instabilities by @xcite suggests that spiral arms with @xmath94 is dynamically unstable and likely produce fragments .",
    "we can say that the spiral arms are marginally stable against fragmentation in the both runs at the time of the snapshot .",
    "still , the difference in the global structure of the protostellar disk affects the evolution of the central protostar in a complicated manner ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to fully resolve the disk structure over a long time .",
    "our test simulations suggest that the mass resolution with voro is effectively higher than with sphere by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "we find that small - scale anisotropic structures are smoothed out when the particles are split in the region with steep density gradient with insufficient resolution with sphere method . to avoid the artificial mixing",
    ", we suggest to impose an additional criterion than the jeans criterion for splitting with the conventional splitting method with spherical distribution of daughters : the length scale of the density fluctuation @xmath53 should be sufficiently resolved by the local sph smoothing length . to confirm this ,",
    "we have performed another simulation with sphere splitting with a substantially higher resolution of @xmath95 .",
    "the high - resolution run indeed shows an elongated cloud and apparent spiral arms , similarly to those found in the voro run .",
    "we emphasize that our splitting method performs only with the modest jeans criterion , because the distribution of daughters traces the original anisotropic density structure before splitting .",
    "the method saves computational cost by effectively reducing the number of particles necessary to resolve the cloud structures .",
    "it is actually costly to construct the voronoi diagrams with the current algorithm . in the simulations with @xmath65 , the computational time until the density of the cloud center reaches @xmath96 is 48,315 ( sphere ) and 81,320 ( voro ) seconds using 128 cores .",
    "the voronoi tessellation accounts for about a half of the total computational time .",
    "however , in the simulation of sphere with @xmath97 , where the bar - like structure is seen also with the conventional splitting method , the computational time is 323,309 seconds , exceeding the time for voro with @xmath65 .",
    "clearly , the formation of small - scale structrue such as the bar - like structure is accurately followed with smaller computational time with our splitting method .",
    "we can further save the computational cost for generation of the voronoi tessellation by introducing the incremental construction algorithm scaling as @xmath98 @xcite . in a forthcoming paper ,",
    "we present an efficient scheme to parallelize the algorithm that scales as @xmath99 ( chiaki , yoshikawa & yoshida in prep . ) .",
    "we note that there have been some simplifications adopted in our method .",
    "first , we place the daughter particles at the center of the mass of the subcells as shown in figure [ fig : split_demo_3d ] .",
    "another promising choice might be to place daughters such that the original voronoi planes between the parent and the neighboring particles are not affected even after the splitting .",
    "second , we still follow the traditional sph scheme to solve the equation of motion . @xcite",
    "point out that the traditional sph scheme causes asymmetric errors of density and pressure estimations at boundaries between the two phases with different densities .",
    "the density and pressure errors obviously affect the fluid motion .",
    "we find that , in the case of our particle splitting , the pressure perturbation at the boundary between the fine and coarse regions nearly cancel out and thus spurious force is not induced .",
    "third , the distribution of the parent particles has intrinsic noise due to its discrete nature",
    ". then unphysical anisotropic shapes of the voronoi cells might generate and even promote density perturbations .",
    "we could regulate the shapes of the voronoi cells by lloyd s algorithm @xcite , which is expected to yield accurate density estimates .",
    "finally , we adopt the cubic spline kernel to estimate the density as in the standard sph .",
    "the choice of other kernel functions and the number of the neighbor particles would affect the accuracy of the density reconstruction .",
    "overall , we have shown that our splitting method based on the voronoi diagram improves the preservation of the density and the morphology of gravitationally contracting clouds even with the minimal implementation , but further studies are certainly warranted to optimize the choice and the implementation of each part of the splitting scheme .",
    "the splitting method can be applied not only to simulations of star forming clouds but also to other astrophysical problems .",
    "for example , in the downstream of the cooling shocks , the density rapidly increases by three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the density structure is highly anisotropic around the shock front by hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the dense shocked region can be fully resolved by our splitting method while maintaining the fine structure .",
    "we can also perform de - refinement of the particles as the converse operation of the particle splitting .",
    "the particles to be merged can be uniquely identified once we define the voronoi diagram .",
    "an example implemented in a moving - mesh code is found in arepo @xcite .",
    "the de - refinement can also be applied to the problem of an interstellar shock , where the density of fluid elements decreases after passing through the shocked region . in such cases ,",
    "de - refinement of particles behind the shock will significantly save the number of particles and the overall computational time .",
    "we continue developing the de - refinement techniques based on the voronoi diagrams .",

    "<S> we present a novel method for particle splitting in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our method utilizes the voronoi diagram for a given particle set to determine the position of fine daughter particles . </S>",
    "<S> we perform several test simulations to compare our method with a conventional splitting method in which the daughter particles are placed isotropically over the local smoothing length . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , with our method , the density deviation after splitting is reduced by a factor of about two compared with the conventional method . </S>",
    "<S> splitting would smooth out the anisotropic density structure if the daughters are distributed isotropically , but our scheme allows the daughter particles to trace the original density distribution with length scales of the mean separation of their parent . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the particle splitting to simulations of the primordial gas cloud collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal evolution is accurately followed to the hydrogen number density of @xmath0 . with the effective mass resolution of @xmath1 after the multi - step particle splitting , the protostellar disk structure is well resolved . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the method offers an efficient way to simulate the evolution of an interstellar gas and the formation of stars .    </S>",
