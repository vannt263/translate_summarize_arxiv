    "after many years , new measurements of the diffractive structure function have been made at the @xmath2 collider hera , where 27.5  gev electrons or positrons collide with 820 or 920  gev protons  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse all these data under three different theoretical approaches , which are described in section ii .",
    "we also study the compatibility of all experimental data , by fitting all sets together for each model . in this introduction , we remind briefly the main features of the models , used in this paper to understand the diffractive interactions .    in a frame where the incident proton is very fast ,",
    "the diffractive reaction can be seen as the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of a virtual photon on the proton target , with a very fast proton in the final state .",
    "we can therefore expect to probe partons in a very specific way , under the exchange of a color singlet state . starting with the pioneering theoretical work of ref.@xcite",
    ", the idea of a point - like structure of the pomeron exchange opens the way to the determination of its parton ( quark and gluon ) distributions , where the pomeron point - like structure can be treated in a similar way as ( and compared to ) the proton one .",
    "indeed , leading twist contributions to the proton diffractive structure functions can be defined by factorisation properties @xcite in much the same way as for the full proton structure functions themselves . as such",
    ", they should obey dglap evolution equations @xcite , and tehrefore allow for perturbative predictions of their @xmath3 evolution . on a phenomenological ground ,",
    "these diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) are the basis of mc simulations like rapgap @xcite and they give a comparison basis with hard diffraction at the tevatron  @xcite , where the factorisation properties are not expected to be valid .",
    "moreover , the study of dpdfs is also a challenge for the discussion of different approaches and models where other than leading twist contributions can be present in hard diffraction .",
    "indeed , a strong presumptive evidence exists that higher twist effects may be quite important in diffractive processes contrary to non - diffractive ones which do not require ( at least at not too small @xmath3 ) such contributions",
    ". in fact , there are models which incorporate non - negligible contributions from higher twist components , especially for relatively small masses of the diffractive system .",
    "one of our goals in this paper is to take into account this peculiarity of diffractive processes .",
    "it is also useful to look at @xmath2 scattering in a frame where the virtual photon moves very fast ( for instance in the proton rest frame , where the @xmath4 has a momentum of up to about 50 tev at hera ) .",
    "the virtual photon can fluctuate into a quark - antiquark pair , forming a small color dipole .",
    "because of its large lorentz boost , this virtual pair has a lifetime much longer than a typical strong interaction time . since the interaction between the pair and the proton",
    "is mediated by the strong interaction , diffractive events are possible .",
    "an advantage of studying diffraction in @xmath2 collisions is that , for sufficiently large photon virtuality @xmath3 , the typical transverse dimensions of the dipole are small compared to the size of a hadron .",
    "the interaction between the quark and the antiquark , as well as the interaction of the pair with the proton , can be treated perturbatively . with decreasing @xmath3",
    "the color dipole becomes larger , and at very low @xmath3 these interactions become so strong that a description in terms of quarks and gluons is no longer justified , and the diffractive reactions become very similar to those in hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the different models used to fit the hera data that are described in section iii . in section",
    "iv we start the analysis of these data with the psf based approach , leading to the concept of parton distribution functions .",
    "we extract dpdfs under several fit conditions and many details are discussed in appendix a and b. then , in sections v to vii , we follow with fits of hera data using dipole models , for which we can consider saturation effects . in particular , the case of the two - gluon exchange model ( bekw ) is shown to be quite efficient to reproduce the data over a large kinematic range including the higher - twist part .",
    "results are discussed in section viii .",
    "all the approaches covered in this paper give different properties concerning , e.g. , the pomeron intercept dependences and the longitudinal diffractive structure function .",
    "these aspects are discussed and and outlook is given .",
    "in this section , we discuss the phenomenology of the different models used to fit the hera data .        the diffractive structure function @xmath5 is investigated in the framework of regge phenomenology and expressed as a sum of two factorized contributions corresponding to a pomeron and secondary reggeon trajectories @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the fractional momentum loss of the incident proton and @xmath0 has the form of a bjorken variable defined with respect to the momentum @xmath8 lost by the initial proton as illustrated on fig .",

    "(  [ reggeform ] ) , @xmath9 can be interpreted as the pomeron structure function and @xmath10 as an effective reggeon structure function , with the restriction that it takes into account various secondary regge contributions which can hardly be separated . the pomeron and reggeon fluxes are assumed to follow a regge behaviour with linear trajectories @xmath11 , such that    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the minimum kinematically allowed value of @xmath14 and @xmath15 gev@xmath16 is the limit of the measurement .",
    "the values of the @xmath17-slopes parameters can be taken from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath18 gev@xmath19 , @xmath20 gev@xmath19 , @xmath21 gev@xmath19 and @xmath22 gev@xmath19 . following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pomeron intercept @xmath23 is let as a free parameter in the qcd fit and @xmath24 is fixed to @xmath25 .",
    "the apparent regge - factorisation breaking , in other words , the fact that we can not separate the @xmath26 from the @xmath0 and @xmath3 dependence of the diffractive structure function is explained in these kinds of models by introducing the pomeron and reggeon trajectories .",
    "as we see in the following , other models such as dipole models show an intrinsic factorisation breaking and it is of great interest to see if the secondary trajectories are still needed by the fits .",
    "we assign parton distribution functions to the pomeron and to the reggeon . a simple prescription",
    "is adopted in which the parton distributions of both the pomeron and the reggeon are parametrised in terms of non - perturbative input distributions at some low scale @xmath27 . for the structure of the sub - leading reggeon trajectory , the pion structure function @xcite is assumed with a free global normalization to be determined by the data .    for the pomeron",

    "the contribution to @xmath38 from charm quarks is calculated in the fixed flavour scheme using the photon - gluon fusion prescription given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the contribution from heavier quarks is neglected .",
    "no momentum sum rule is imposed because of the theoretical uncertainty in specifying the normalization of the pomeron or reggeon fluxes and because it is not clear that such a sum rule is appropriate for the parton distributions of a virtual exchange .",
    "note that diffractive distributions are process - independent functions .",
    "they appear not only in inclusive diffraction but also in other processes where diffractive hard - scattering factorisation holds .",
    "the cross section of such a process can be evaluated as the convolution of the relevant parton - level cross section with the dpdfs .",
    "for instance , the cross section for charm production in diffractive dis can be calculated at leading order in @xmath39 from the @xmath40 cross section and the diffractive gluon distribution .",
    "an analogous statement holds for jet production in diffractive dis .",
    "both processes have been analysed at next - to - leading order in @xmath39 .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the dpdfs extracted at hera can be used to describe hard diffractive processes like the production of jets , heavy quarks or weak gauge bosons in @xmath41 collisions at the tevatron .",
    "the fraction of diffractive dijet events at cdf is a factor 3 to 10 smaller than would be expected on the basis of the hera data .",
    "the same type of discrepancy is consistently observed in all hard diffractive processes in @xmath41 events , see e.g.  @xcite . in general , while at hera hard diffraction contributes a fraction of order 10% to the total cross section , it contributes only to about 1% at the tevatron .",
    "this qcd - factorisation breaking observed in hadron - hadron scattering can be interpreted as a survival gap probability or a soft color interaction that need to be considered in such reactions , and a detailed computation of dpdfs from hera can help in a better understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "this model assumes the simplest perturbative description of the pomeron by a two - gluon ladder @xcite .",
    "contrary to the qcd fits described in the previous section , there is no concept of dpdfs in this approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a parametrisation of the diffractive structure function in terms of three main contributions is proposed .",
    "the first term describes the diffractive production of a @xmath42 pair from a transversely polarised photon , the second one the production of a diffractive @xmath43 system , and the third one the production of a @xmath42 component from a longitudinally polarised photon .",
    "we note that the higher fock states such as @xmath44 are not included in this model as we discuss it further in the next section .",

    "<S> we describe the most recent data on the diffractive structure functions from the h1 and zeus collaborations at hera using four models . </S>",
    "<S> first , a pomeron structure function ( psf ) model , in which the pomeron is considered as an object with parton distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> then , the bartels ellis kowalski wsthoff ( bekw ) approach is discussed , assuming the simplest perturbative description of the pomeron using a two - gluon ladder . a third approach , the bialas peschanski ( bp ) model , based on the dipole formalism </S>",
    "<S> is then described . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the golec - biernat - wsthoff ( gbw ) saturation model which takes into account saturation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the best description of all avaible measurements can be achieved with either the psf based model or the bekw approach . in particular , the bekw prediction allows to include the highest @xmath0 measurements , which are dominated by higher twists effects and provide an efficient and compact parametrisation of the diffractive cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the two other models also give a good description of cross section measurements at small @xmath1 with a small number of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of all predictions allows us to identify interesting differences in the behaviour of the effective pomeron intercept and in the shape of the longitudinal component of the diffractive structure functions . in this last part </S>",
    "<S> , we present some features that can be discriminated by new experimental measurements , completing the hera program . </S>"
