    "observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) indicate that the universe is experiencing an accelerating expansion at the present stage @xcite .",
    "this cosmic acceleration has also been confirmed by observations of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the cause for this cosmic acceleration is usually referred to as `` dark energy '' , a mysterious exotic matter with large enough negative pressure , whose energy density has been a dominative power of the universe ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the astrophysical feature of dark energy is that it remains unclustered at all scales where gravitational clustering of baryons and nonbaryonic cold dark matter can be seen .",
    "its gravity effect is shown as a repulsive force so as to make the expansion of the universe accelerate when its energy density becomes dominative power of the universe .",
    "the combined analysis of cosmological observations suggests that the universe is spatially flat , and consists of about @xmath6 dark energy , @xmath7 dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation .",
    "although we can affirm that the ultimate fate of the universe is determined by the feature of dark energy , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain enigmatic at present . however",
    ", we still can propose some candidates to interpret or describe the properties of dark energy .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath8 @xcite which always suffers from the `` fine - tuning '' and `` cosmic coincidence '' puzzles .",
    "theorists have made lots of efforts to try to resolve the cosmological constant problem , but all these efforts were turned out to be unsuccessful .",
    "numerous other candidates for dark energy have also been proposed in the literature , such as an evolving canonical scalar field @xcite usually referred to as quintessence , the phantom energy @xcite with an equation - of - state smaller than @xmath9 violating the weak energy condition , the quintom energy @xcite with an equation - of - state evolving across @xmath9 , the hessence model @xcite , the chaplygin gas model @xcite , and so forth .    actually , the dark energy problem may be in principle a problem belongs to quantum gravity domain @xcite .",
    "another promising model for dark energy , the holographic dark energy model , was proposed by li @xcite from some considerations of fundamental principle in the quantum gravity .",
    "it is well known that the holographic principle is an important result of the recent researches for exploring the quantum gravity or string theory @xcite .",
    "this principle is enlightened by investigations of the quantum property of black holes .",
    "roughly speaking , in a quantum gravity system , the conventional local quantum field theory will break down .",
    "the reason is rather simple : for a quantum gravity system , the conventional local quantum field theory contains too many degrees of freedom , and such many degrees of freedom will lead to the formation of black hole so as to break down the effectiveness of the quantum field theory .    for an effective field theory in a box of size @xmath10 , with uv cut - off @xmath11",
    "the entropy @xmath12 scales extensively , @xmath13 .",
    "however , the peculiar thermodynamics of black hole @xcite has led bekenstein to postulate that the maximum entropy in a box of volume @xmath14 behaves nonextensively , growing only as the area of the box , i.e. there is a so - called bekenstein entropy bound , @xmath15 .",
    "this nonextensive scaling suggests that quantum field theory breaks down in large volume . to reconcile this breakdown with the success of local quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology , cohen et al",
    "@xcite proposed a more restrictive bound  the energy bound .",
    "they pointed out that in quantum field theory a short distance ( uv ) cut - off is related to a long distance ( ir ) cut - off due to the limit set by forming a black hole . in other words , if the quantum zero - point energy density @xmath16 is relevant to a uv cut - off , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath10 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus we have @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the maximum entropy is in order of @xmath18 .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle @xcite is viewed as dark energy , usually dubbed holographic dark energy ( its density is denoted as @xmath19 hereafter ) .",
    "the largest ir cut - off @xmath10 is chosen by saturating the inequality so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xmath20 where @xmath0 is a numerical constant , and @xmath21 is the reduced planck mass . if we take @xmath10 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble radius @xmath22 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result . however , hsu @xcite pointed out that this yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy .",
    "li @xcite subsequently proposed that the ir cut - off @xmath10 should be taken as the size of the future event horizon @xmath23 then the problem can be solved nicely and the holographic dark energy model can thus be constructed successfully .",
    "the holographic dark energy scenario may provide simultaneously natural solutions to both dark energy problems as demonstrated in @xcite . for extensive studies on the holographic dark energy model",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the holographic dark energy model has been tested and constrained by various astronomical observations , such as snia @xcite , cmb @xcite , combination of snia , cmb and lss @xcite , the x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters @xcite , and the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , the three - year data of _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) observations @xcite were announced . moreover , riess et al .",
    "@xcite lately released the up - to - date 182 `` gold '' data of snia from various sources analyzed in a consistent and robust mannor with reduced calibration errors arising from systematics .",
    "this paper aims at placing new observational constraints on the holographic dark energy model by using the gold sample of 182 snia compiled by riess et al .",
    "@xcite , the cmb shift parameter derived from three - year _ wmap _ observations @xcite , and the baryon acoustic oscillations detected in the large - scale correlation function of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxies @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : holode ] we discuss the basic characteristics of the holographic dark energy model . in section",
    "[ sec : constrain ] , we perform constraints on the holographic dark energy model by using the up - to - date observational datasets . finally , we give the concluding remarks in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we shall review the holographic dark energy model briefly and discuss the basic characteristics of this model .",
    "now let us consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with matter component @xmath24 ( including both baryon matter and cold dark matter ) and holographic dark energy component @xmath19 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath25 or equivalently , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the redshift of the universe . note",
    "that we always assume spatial flatness throughout this paper as motivated by inflation . combining the definition of the holographic dark energy ( [ de ] ) and the definition of the future event horizon ( [ eh ] ) , we derive @xmath28 we notice that the friedmann equation ( [ ez ] ) implies @xmath29 substituting ( [ fri ] ) into ( [ rh ] ) , one obtains the following equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 . then taking derivative with respect to @xmath32 in both sides of the above relation",
    ", we get easily the dynamics satisfied by the dark energy , i.e. the differential equation about the fractional density of dark energy , @xmath33 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath34 .",
    "this equation describes behavior of the holographic dark energy completely , and it can be solved exactly @xcite . from the energy conservation equation of the dark energy , the equation of state of the dark energy can be given @xcite @xmath35 note that the formula @xmath36 and the differential equation of @xmath37 ( [ deq ] ) are used in the second equal sign .",
    "it can be seen clearly that the equation of state of the holographic dark energy evolves dynamically and satisfies @xmath38 due to @xmath39 .",
    "hence , we see clearly that when taking the holographic principle into account the vacuum energy becomes dynamically evolving dark energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 plays a significant role in this model .",
    "if one takes @xmath40 , the behavior of the holographic dark energy will be more and more like a cosmological constant with the expansion of the universe , such that ultimately the universe will enter the de sitter phase in the far future .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , if one puts the parameter @xmath41 into ( [ w ] ) , then a definite prediction of this model , @xmath42 , will be given .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath4 , the holographic dark energy will exhibit appealing behavior that the equation of state crosses the `` cosmological - constant boundary '' ( or `` phantom divide '' ) @xmath43 during the evolution .",
    "this kind of dark energy is referred to as `` quintom '' @xcite which is slightly favored by current observations , see e.g. @xcite . if @xmath5 , the equation of state of dark energy will be always larger than @xmath9 such that the universe avoids entering the de sitter phase and the big rip phase .",
    "hence , we see explicitly , the value of @xmath0 is very important for the holographic dark energy model , which determines the feature of the holographic dark energy as well as the ultimate fate of the universe . for an illustrative example , see figure 1 in @xcite , in which the selected evolutions in different @xmath0 for the equation of state of holographic dark energy are plotted .",
    "it is clear to see that the cases in @xmath44 always evolve in the region of @xmath45 , whereas the case of @xmath4 behaves as a quintom whose equation of state @xmath46 crosses the cosmological constant boundary @xmath43 during the evolution .",
    "it has been shown in previous analyses of observational data @xcite that the holographic dark energy exhibits quintom - like behavior basically within statistical error one sigma .    ; the green dashed line represents the best - fit for snia+cmb+lss joint analysis with @xmath47 .",

    "the points show the best - fit cases for snia alone analysis and for snia+cmb+lss joint analysis , respectively . ]     for the fits of snia alone and snia+cmb+lss . ]",
    "in this section , we constrain the parameters in the holographic dark energy model and analyze the evolutionary behavior of holographic dark energy by using the latest observational data of snia combined with the information from cmb and lss observations .",
    "recently , the up - to - date gold sample of snia consists of 182 data was compiled by riess et al .",
    "it contains 119 points from the previous sample compiled in @xcite and 16 points with @xmath54 discovered recently @xcite by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "it also incorporates 47 points ( @xmath55 ) from the first year release of the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) sample @xcite out of a total of 73 distant snia .",
    "some previous gold data were excluded in @xcite due to highly uncertain color measurements , high extinction @xmath56 and a redshift cut @xmath57 , to avoid the influence of a possible local `` hubble bubble '' , so as to define a high - confidence sample .",
    "the total gold sample spans a wide range of redshift @xmath58 . for recent usages of the new sample ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we shall analyze the holographic dark energy model in the light of the new gold sample of snia .",
    "the snia observations directly measure the apparent magnitude @xmath59 of a supernova and its redshift @xmath34 .",
    "the apparent magnitude @xmath59 is related to the luminosity distance @xmath60 of the supernova through @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the absolute magnitude which is believed to be constant for all type ia supernovae , and the luminosity distance - redshift relation is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the absolute luminosity which is a known value for the standard candle snia , @xmath65 is the measured flux , @xmath66 ( here we use the natural unit , namely the speed of light is defined to be 1 ) represents the hubble distance with value @xmath67 mpc , and @xmath68 is expressed in equation ( [ ez ] ) .",
    "note that the dynamical behavior of @xmath37 is governed by differential equation ( [ deq ] ) . in order to place constraints on the holographic dark energy model , we perform @xmath69 statistics for the model parameters @xmath70 and the present hubble parameter @xmath71 . for the snia analysis , we have @xmath72 ^ 2\\over \\sigma_i^2}~,\\label{chisn}\\ ] ] where the extinction - corrected distance moduli @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the total uncertainty in the observation .",
    "the likelihood @xmath76 if the measurement errors are gaussian .",
    "the best - fit for the analysis of gold sample of 182 snia happens at @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "the gold sample is illustrated on a residual hubble diagram with respect to our best - fit universe in figure [ fig : hubble ] .",
    "since we concentrate on the model parameters @xmath81 , we need to marginalize over the hubble parameter @xmath71 .",
    "note that marginalizing over @xmath71 is equivalent to evaluating @xmath69 at its minimum with respect to @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "we marginalize over the nuisance parameter @xmath82 and show the probability contours at @xmath83 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 confidence levels for @xmath0 vs. @xmath84 in figure [ fig : contour ] , from the constraints of gold sample of snia , as purple dot - dashed contours .",
    "the 1 @xmath1 fit values for the model parameters are : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we see that the parameter @xmath0 in 1 @xmath1 range , @xmath87 , is smaller than 1 , making the holographic dark energy behave as quintom with equation - of - state evolving across @xmath43 , according to this analysis .    on the other hand , the above analysis shows that the snia data alone seem not sufficient to constrain the holographic dark energy model strictly .",
    "the confidence region of @xmath88 plane is rather large , especially for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable that the best fit value of @xmath84 of this model is evidently larger than that of the @xmath11cdm model . for comparison",
    ", we refer to the _ wmap _ result for @xmath84 in @xmath11cdm model : @xmath89 @xcite . as has been elucidated in @xcite that for the holographic dark energy the fit of snia data is very sensitive to the hubble parameter @xmath71 , so it is very important to find other observational quantities irrelevant to @xmath71 as a complement to snia data .",

    "it is clear to see that the combined analysis of snia , cmb and lss data provides a fairly tight constraint on the holographic dark energy model , comparing to the constraint from the snia gold sample alone .",

    "we see clearly that in the joint analysis the derived value for matter density @xmath84 is very reasonable .",
    "in addition , it should be emphasized that what is of importance for this model is the determination of the value of @xmath0 . in figure [ fig : likelihood ] we plot the 1-dimensional likelihood function for @xmath0 , marginalizing over the other parameters .",

    "we see that the holographic dark energy features quintom dark energy within one - sigma range in this case .",
    "furthermore , we also consider a strong _ hst _ prior , fixing @xmath127 , in order to see how strongly biased constraints can be derived from a factitious prior on @xmath82 .",
    "we plot the results of this case in figure [ fig : strongprior ] .",
    "the fit values for model parameters with one - sigma errors are @xmath123 and @xmath128 .",
    "we find that the shrinkage and the left - shift for the confidence level contours become more evident . for illustrating the cosmological consequences led by the observational constraints",
    ", we show the evolution cases of the equation - of - state parameter @xmath129 and the deceleration parameter @xmath130 according to some best - fit values of parameters of the holographic dark energy model in figure [ fig : wz ] and [ fig : qz ] .",
    "the quintom feature with @xmath43 crossing characteristic for the holographic dark energy model can be easily seen .",
    "the cosmic acceleration observed by distance - redshift relation measurement of snia strongly supports the existence of dark energy .",
    "the fantastic physical property of dark energy not only drives the current cosmic acceleration , but also determines the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "however , hitherto , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin still remain enigmatic for us .",
    "though the underlying theory of dark energy is still far beyond our knowledge , it is guessed that the quantum gravity theory shall play a significant role in resolving the dark energy enigma .",
    "the holographic dark energy model is proposed as an attempt for probing the nature of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity , i.e. it is based upon an important fundamental principle of quantum gravity  holographic principle , so it possesses some significant features of an underlying theory of dark energy .",
    "the main characteristic of holographic dark energy is governed by a numerical parameter @xmath0 in the model .",
    "this parameter , @xmath0 , can only be determined by observations .",
    "hence , in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe , it is of extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter @xmath0 by using the currently available observational data .    in this paper , we have analyzed the holographic dark energy model by using the up - to - date gold snia sample , combined with the cmb and lss data .",
    "since the snia data are sensitive to the hubble constant @xmath71 , while the shift parameter in cmb and the parameter in the bao are irrelevant to the hubble parameter , the combination of these datasets leads to strong constraints on the model parameters , as shown in figure [ fig : contour ] .",
    "the joint analysis indicates that , though the possibility of @xmath4 is more favored , the possibility of @xmath5 can not be excluded in one - sigma error range , which is somewhat different from the result derived from previous investigations using earlier data ( such as @xcite , in which the result of @xmath4 is basically favored in 1-@xmath1 range ) .",
    "that is to say , according to the new data , the evidence for the quintom feature in the holographic dark energy model is not as strong as before .",
    "however , when considering the _ hst _ prior , @xmath120 , the quintom - like behavior can be supported in one - sigma error range , as shown in figure [ fig : modestprior ] . on the whole ,",
    "the current observational data have no ability to constrain the parameters in the holographic dark energy model on a high precision level .",
    "we expect that the future high - precision observations such as the supernova / acceleration project ( snap ) will be capable of determining the value of @xmath0 exactly and thus revealing the property of the holographic dark energy .",

    "<S> the holographic dark energy model is proposed by li as an attempt for probing the nature of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the main characteristic of holographic dark energy is governed by a numerical parameter @xmath0 in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 can only be determined by observations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the universe , it is of extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter @xmath0 by using the currently available observational data . in this paper , we derive constraints on the holographic dark energy model from the latest observational data including the gold sample of 182 type ia supernovae ( snia ) , the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) given by the three - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ wmap _ ) observations , and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the joint analysis gives the fit results in 1-@xmath1 : @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , though the possibility of @xmath4 is more favored , the possibility of @xmath5 can not be excluded in one - sigma error range , which is somewhat different from the result derived from previous investigations using earlier data . </S>",
    "<S> so , according to the new data , the evidence for the quintom feature in the holographic dark energy model is not as strong as before . </S>"
