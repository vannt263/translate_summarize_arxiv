    "chern - simons field theory has attracted the attention of both mathematicians and physicists .",
    "its relevance in mathematics is largely due to its applications in fields such as knot theory , see @xcite or the book @xcite , and the theory of moduli spaces of flat connections , see @xcite for a summary .",
    "these research areas in turn provide useful concepts and methods for the study of chern - simons theory . from a physicist s point of view , chern - simons theory is interesting because it captures important aspects of real physical systems and is at the same time mathematically tractable .",
    "while not describing any real physical system , it plays an important role in , for example , the modelling of certain condensed matter systems .",
    "more importantly , it shares structural features with fundamental physical theories .",
    "its diffeomorphism invariance , for instance , makes it a useful toy model for the investigation of coordinate independent approaches to quantisation .",
    "in particular , it is relevant to the study of einstein s theory of gravity , which in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions can be formulated as a chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "the basic reason for the relative mathematical simplicity of chern - simons theory is that , with appropriate boundary conditions and after dividing out gauge degrees of freedom , it has a finite - dimensional phase space .",
    "thus , in suitable circumstances chern - simons theory allows one to reduce the field - theoretic description of a physical system to a mathematically well - defined and finite - dimensional model .",
    "this reduction from an infinite to a finite number of degrees of freedom makes the classical theory tractable and considerably simplifies the quantisation .",
    "in this paper we study chern - simons theory in its hamiltonian formulation on a manifold of topology @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a surface of genus @xmath3 with @xmath4 punctures .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to introduce a new way of treating punctures in chern - simons theory and to determine the physical phase space and its symplectic structure when one distinguished puncture is treated in this way .",
    "the main result is an explicit determination of the symplectic structure on the finite - dimensional physical phase space .",
    "the motivation for our treatment of the distinguished puncture comes from the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity . as we explain in detail in a separate paper @xcite ,",
    "the distinguished puncture can be used to model `` spatial infinity '' in open universes . applied to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity , our model leads to a finite - dimensional description of the phase space which can serve as a starting point for both an investigation of the classical dynamics and for quantisation , using the methods developed in @xcite .",
    "the relation to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity is also the motivation for our choice of gauge group .",
    "we consider gauge groups of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath8 is an arbitrary finite - dimensional lie group .",
    "they include as special cases the euclidean group and the poincar group in three dimensions which arise in the chern - simons formulation of euclidean and lorentzian ( 2 + 1)-gravity with vanishing cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "mathematically , groups of the form @xmath0 are particularly simple examples of poisson - lie groups , which is important in our analysis .",
    "we stress , however , that our treatment of the distinguished puncture and many of our results concerning the phase space are not limited to gauge groups of this type .",
    "since much of the paper is quite technical , we give a brief sketch of our treatment of punctures on @xmath2 . the usual approach , followed in @xcite and summarised in @xcite ,",
    "is to require the curvature of the gauge field to have a delta - function singularity on the line @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the coordinate of the puncture on @xmath2 , and to restrict the lie algebra valued coefficient of the delta - function to a fixed coadjoint orbit of the gauge group . in order to achieve this ,",
    "additional variables need to be introduced which parametrise the coadjoint orbit .",
    "the dynamics of these additional variables is governed by the kirillov - kostant - souriau symplectic structure on the coadjoint orbit minimally coupled to the chern - simons gauge field . in this paper",
    "we treat the first @xmath5 punctures on @xmath2 in this way . at the distinguished puncture ,",
    "whose coordinate on @xmath2 is denoted @xmath11 , we also require the curvature to have a delta - function singularity , but this time we do not restrict the lie algebra valued coefficient @xmath12 . instead we introduce an additional lie group valued variable @xmath3 at the distinguished puncture and interpret the pair @xmath13 as an element of the cotangent bundle of the gauge group .",
    "the dynamics of the variables @xmath3 and @xmath12 is governed by the canonical symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle minimally coupled to the chern - simons gauge field .",
    "having defined the field - theoretical model we parametrise the physical phase space as a finite - dimensional quotient of a finite - dimensional extended phase space and compute the pull - back of the symplectic structure to the extended phase space .",
    "our calculations make extensive use of the results and techniques of @xcite . in that paper , alekseev and malkin consider chern - simons theory with a simple , complex gauge group ( or its compact real form ) on a three - manifold of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a surface of genus @xmath3 with @xmath5 punctures which are treated in the usual way . here",
    "we extend their analysis to include the distinguished puncture and to apply to gauge groups of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath8 is any real lie group .",
    "in particular , we do not assume the existence of a single abelian cartan subalgebra into which any lie algebra element can be conjugated ; such a cartan subalgebra plays an important role in @xcite .",
    "however , the semi - direct product structure of @xmath0 also leads to simplifications .",
    "it allows us to give a more detailed formula for pull - back of the symplectic form to the extended phase space and to show that this pull - back is exact .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . after explaining our notation and conventions in sect .  2",
    ", we define our field - theoretical model by giving the action and equations of motion in sect .",
    "the rather technical sect .",
    "4 explains the adaptation of alekseev and malkin s method to our situation and ends in a first formula for the pull - back of the symplectic form to the extended phase space , valid for any gauge group . in sect .  5 we use the structure of the gauge group @xmath0 to derive the formula for the pull - back of the symplectic form as an exterior derivative of a one - form .",
    "in sect .",
    "6 we explain in detail how the physical phase space is obtained from the extended phase space by imposing various constraints and dividing by the associated gauge transformations . sect .",
    "7 contains a short discussion and conclusion , and the appendices [ heisenberg ] and [ alekseevmalkin ] , respectively , summarise the properties of groups @xmath0 as poisson - lie groups and key results from @xcite needed in the main part of the paper .",
    "let @xmath16 be a three - manifold of topology @xmath17 , where @xmath2 is an oriented two - dimensional manifold of genus @xmath3 with @xmath4 punctures . of these",
    ", one will play a special role , and we refer to it as the distinguished puncture to differentiate it from the remaining @xmath5 ordinary punctures .",
    "we introduce a global coordinate @xmath18 on @xmath19 , write @xmath20 for local coordinates on the surface @xmath2 and denote the differentiation with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the coordinates of the @xmath5 ordinary punctures on @xmath2 are @xmath25 , and the distinguished puncture has the coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "we refer to the one - dimensional submanifolds defined by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 as , respectively , the world lines of the ordinary punctures and the distinguished puncture .",
    "chern - simons theory is a field theory for an @xmath30-connection on @xmath16 . for now",
    ", @xmath30 can be an arbitrary finite - dimensional lie group , but we will restrict ourselves to a particular class of lie groups further below .",
    "locally , the connection is given by a lie algebra valued one - form @xmath31 on @xmath16 , called the gauge field .",
    "the product structure @xmath32 allows us to decompose the gauge field as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an @xmath18-dependent and lie algebra valued one - form on @xmath2 and @xmath35 is a lie algebra valued function on @xmath17 . in the following we denote by @xmath36 the exterior derivative on @xmath17 . occasionally , we need to differentiate with respect to the dependence on @xmath2 only and denote such derivatives by @xmath37 . with this notation ,",
    "the curvature of the connection @xmath31 is the two - form [ curv ] f = da + aa , and the splitting leads to the decomposition [ curvdec ] f = dx^0(_0 a_s - d_s a_0 + [ a_0,a_s ] ) + f_s , where @xmath38 is the curvature two - form on @xmath2 : [ curvv ] f_s = d_sa_s + a_sa_s .    in the following , we consider gauge groups that are semi - direct products @xmath39 of a connected , finite - dimensional lie group @xmath8 and the dual @xmath40 of its lie algebra @xmath41 , viewed as an abelian group .",
    "the group @xmath8 acts on its lie algebra @xmath42 by the adjoint action @xmath43 and , following the conventions of @xcite , we define @xmath44 as the algebraic dual of @xmath45 , i.  e.   [ coadact ] ^*(g ) , = , ( g)g ^ * , g , gg , where @xmath46 is the canonical pairing of elements of @xmath42 with elements of @xmath40 .",
    "note that with this definition the coadjoint action of @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 .",
    "writing elements of @xmath49 as @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the group multiplication in @xmath0 is [ groupmult ] ( u_1,_1)(u_2,_2)=(u_1u_2,_1+^*(u_1 ^ -1)_2 ) .    in this paper , all lie algebras will be considered over @xmath19 . the lie algebra of @xmath0 is @xmath53 as a vector space , and we denote it as @xmath54 to remind the reader that it is not the direct sum of @xmath42 and @xmath40 as a lie algebra .",
    "the lie bracket can be characterised as follows .",
    "let @xmath55 , @xmath56 , be a basis of the lie algebra @xmath42 and let @xmath57 , @xmath58 , be the dual basis of @xmath40 i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath60 , @xmath61 , form a basis of @xmath54 with commutators [ commutator ] [ j_a , j_b]=a b c j_c =- a c b p^ c=0 , where @xmath62 are the structure constants of @xmath42 .",
    "the pairing @xmath46 between @xmath42 and @xmath40 can be extended to a symmetric , non - degenerate bilinear form on @xmath54 , also denoted by @xmath46 , by setting , = , , , = , = 0 , , g ^ * , , g .",
    "this pairing is @xmath0-invariant by virtue of , and with this pairing the vector space @xmath53 is canonically isomorphic to its dual .",
    "we will use this isomorphism to identify @xmath54 with its dual without writing it explicitly in the following ; both will be denoted by @xmath54 . in particular , we write both the adjoint and the coadjoint action of an element @xmath63 on @xmath54 simply by conjugation with @xmath64 .    in our discussion of the behaviour of the chern - simons gauge field at the puncture we make",
    "use of coadjoint or , equivalently , adjoint orbits of the @xmath0 .",
    "it is then convenient to parametrise these orbits in the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a fixed element of the lie algebra .",
    "when dealing with lie algebras over @xmath67 or compact forms of complex lie algebras as in @xcite , it is possible to fix one cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra and choose @xmath66 to lie in that cartan subalgebra without loss of generality .",
    "however , for general lie algebras over @xmath19 the theory of cartan subalgebras , defined as nilpotent subalgebras which are their own normaliser , is more complicated .",
    "there are two features which are important for us .",
    "the first is related to the conjugacy of cartan subalgebras . as explained in @xcite or @xcite , cartan subalgebras of real lie algebras can not necessarily be conjugated into each other .",
    "instead , there exists a family of cartan subalgebras @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is some finite index set , such that any cartan subalgebra is conjugate to one of the @xmath68 . moreover , not all elements of the lie algebra lie in a cartan subalgebra .",
    "this is only the case for regular elements of a lie algebra is such that the multiplicity of the characteristic root of @xmath71 is equal to the rank of the lie algebra . ] .",
    "a regular element can therefore always be written as @xmath72 , where @xmath66 is in one of a finite number of fixed cartan subalgebras .",
    "the second issue we need to be aware of is that a cartan subalgebra of a real lie algebra is not necessarily abelian . in order to make sure that all cartan subalgebras of @xmath0 are",
    "abelian we need to assume that @xmath8 is semi - simple .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "cartan subalgebras of semi - simple lie algebras are abelian @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that @xmath42 is semi - simple it follows from theorem 9.5 in chapter 1 of @xcite applied to the levi decomposition @xmath54 that cartan subalgebras of @xmath54 are of the form @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being a cartan subalgebra of @xmath42 and @xmath75 a cartan subalgebra of @xmath40 . however , such subalgebras of @xmath54 are automatically abelian .    with these structural features in mind ,",
    "we adopt the following conventions for cartan subalgebras . in order to parametrise regular elements we pick a finite family of cartan subalgebras @xmath76 of @xmath54 for and write @xmath77 for the subgroup obtained by exponentiating the cartan subalgebra @xmath68 .",
    "we assume the existence of at least one abelian cartan subalgebra and denote it by @xmath74 ; the abelian subgroup obtained by exponentiating @xmath74 is denoted @xmath78 .",
    "the group @xmath0 has the structure of a poisson - lie group , which is described in detail in @xcite and partly reviewed in appendix [ heisenberg ] .",
    "poisson - lie groups have compatible poisson and lie group structures , and for every poisson - lie group there is a dual poisson - lie group where lie and poisson structure are , in a suitable sense , interchanged . as a group ,",
    "the dual of @xmath0 is the direct product @xmath79 .",
    "the poisson - lie group structure gives rise to a diffeomorphism between @xmath0 and its dual @xmath80 which is given by in appendix [ heisenberg ] .",
    "the practical use of this diffeomorphism for our calculations is a parametrisation of elements in @xmath0 in terms of elements of @xmath79 .",
    "writing an element of @xmath79 as @xmath81 the corresponding element in @xmath0 is given by [ gparam ] ( u,)=(u,-^*(u^-1 ) ) ug,,g ^*.",
    "in order to define chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath0 on a surface with punctures we need to specify the behaviour of the gauge field near the punctures . the standard way of including punctures in chern - simons theory is to allow the gauge field to have singularities of a particular form at the punctures .",
    "the singularities are such that the curvature of the spatial gauge field @xmath34 develops delta - function singularities with lie algebra valued coefficients restricted to fixed coadjoint orbits of @xmath0 .",
    "however , motivated by the application to the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity , see @xcite , we now formulate an action functional which allows for the inclusion of an additional puncture where the restriction to fixed coadjoint orbits is not imposed .",
    "we start by summarising the usual treatment of punctures in chern - simons theory @xcite , adapted to gauge groups of the form @xmath0 . for chern - simons theory on a genus @xmath3 surface",
    "@xmath82 with @xmath5 punctures at coordinates @xmath25 , one requires that the spatial curvature takes the form @xmath83 with lie algebra valued coefficients @xmath84 restricted to certain coadjoint orbits of @xmath0 .",
    "this restriction is imposed to ensure that the phase space of the theory is symplectic @xcite .",
    "we assume in the following that the elements @xmath85 are regular .",
    "this assumption simplifies the notation and saves us having to distinguish cases in the discussion .",
    "moreover , it is satisfied in the application to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity which is our main motivation . as explained in the previous section , each regular element @xmath85",
    "can then be conjugated into one of a family of cartan subalgebras @xmath68 , with @xmath86 ranging over a finite index set @xmath70 .",
    "thus we write each @xmath85 in terms of @xmath87 and a fixed elements @xmath88 as [ tidef ]",
    "t_i = h_i d_i h_i^-1 . for a more detailed description and an explicit parametrisation of coadjoint orbits of @xmath0",
    "we refer the reader to appendix [ cotbundle ] .    the action for chern - simons theory coupled to punctures",
    "contains the chern - simons action for the gauge field @xmath31 and kinetic terms for the orbit variables @xmath89 which are derived from the kirillov - kostant - souriau symplectic structure on the coadjoint orbits and coupled to the gauge field via minimal coupling .",
    "the product structure @xmath90 allows us to give the action in its hamiltonian form , which makes use of the decomposition : @xmath91= \\label{ordaction }   & \\int_{\\mathbb{r}}dx^0\\int_{{s_{g , n}^\\infty}}\\tfrac{k}{4\\pi}\\langle\\partial_0 a_s\\wedge",

    "we now include an additional distinguished puncture labelled by @xmath93 , at which the curvature also develops a lie algebra valued singularity , but this time without restriction on the lie algebra element multiplying the delta - function . in order to impose the desired curvature singularity",
    "we introduce a further @xmath54-valued variable @xmath12 ( not restricted to lie on a particular coadjoint orbit ) as well as a group valued variable @xmath94 which will play the role of the conjugate variable to @xmath12 .",
    "similar to the case of the ordinary punctures , the component @xmath35 should again act as a lagrange multiplier imposing the constraint on the spatial curvature , and there should be a dynamical term involving the variables @xmath12 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , in contrast to the ordinary punctures , where the kinetic terms are obtained from the canonical symplectic potential for coadjoint orbit of @xmath0 , the kinetic term we propose for the distinguished puncture is obtained from the canonical symplectic potential on the cotangent bundle of @xmath0 . both these symplectic potentials are discussed and derived in the appendix [ cotbundle ] .",
    "the full action for chern - simons theory on @xmath1 then depends on the gauge field @xmath31 , the group valued functions @xmath95 of @xmath18 and the lie algebra valued function @xmath12 of @xmath18 and is given by @xmath96= \\label{action}\\\\   & \\quad\\;\\;\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}dx^0\\int_{{s_{g , n}^\\infty}}\\tfrac{k}{4\\pi}\\langle\\partial_0 a_s\\wedge a_s\\rangle   -\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}dx^0 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\langle d_i\\,,\\ , h_i^{{-1}}\\partial_0 h_i\\rangle+\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}dx^0 \\langle t , g\\partial_0 g^{{-1}}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\   & \\quad+\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}dx^0\\int_{{s_{g , n}^\\infty}}\\langle a_0\\,,\\ , \\tfrac{k}{2\\pi}f_s - t\\delta^{(2)}(x-{x_\\infty})dx^1\\wedge dx^2-\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i\\delta^{(2)}(x - x_{(i)})dx^1\\wedge dx^2 \\rangle .   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    variation of the action yields the equations of motion and constraints .",
    "varying with respect to the lagrange multiplier @xmath35 we obtain the constraint @xmath97 which imposes the required delta - function singularities of the curvature at the punctures as well as the vanishing of the curvature @xmath38 outside the punctures .",

    "in particular , regularity is therefore preserved under evolution .",
    "the action is invariant under gauge transformations which combine the usual gauge transformations of the gauge field with transformations of the variables associated to the punctures .",
    "let @xmath105 be an arbitrary smooth function which is also well defined on the world lines of the punctures .",
    "then the action is invariant under @xmath106 in addition , the action is invariant ( up to a total @xmath18 derivative ) under the transformations @xmath107 with functions @xmath108 taking values in the stabiliser group of @xmath92 , i.e. the subgroup of elements of @xmath0 whose coadjoint action leaves @xmath92 invariant .",
    "the gauge transformation arises because of the redundancy in the parametrisation of @xmath85 via @xmath100 .    for our calculation of the symplectic structure in the next section",
    "we need to parametrise the lie algebra element @xmath12 in analogy with in terms of a general group element @xmath63 and an element @xmath66 in one of the cartan subalgebras of @xmath54 . as explained in sect .  2 ,",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that @xmath12 is a regular element of @xmath54 .",
    "regularity is preserved under conjugation and , following the remark made after , the assumption of regularity is thus consistent with the equations of motion for @xmath12 .",
    "we assume moreover that @xmath12 can be conjugated into an abelian cartan subalgebra . as explained in sect .  2 ,",
    "this assumption is automatically fulfilled for regular elements when @xmath8 is semi - simple .",
    "we pick one such abelian cartan subalgebra , denoted @xmath74 as in sect .  2 , and write @xmath12 as @xmath109 with a phase space variable @xmath110 .",
    "note that choices of non - conjugate cartan subalgebras lead , in general , to different theories . also , we observe that in trading the dynamical variable @xmath12 for the two dynamical variables @xmath64 and @xmath66 we have introduced a redundancy which leads to an additional gauge invariance , as we shall see .    using the parametrisation we rewrite the kinetic term of the distinguished puncture in as @xmath111 with @xmath112 see also @xcite where a similar coordinate transformation is discussed .",

    "the action is invariant under @xmath120 with a @xmath18-dependent function @xmath121 which , for each @xmath18 , takes values in the stabiliser group of @xmath122 .",
    "in this section , we derive a description of the symplectic structure on the phase space in terms of a finite number of variables closely related to the holonomies of certain curves on the surface @xmath2 .",
    "we start with the canonical symplectic form associated to the action @xmath123 where the symbol @xmath124 stands for exterior differentiation in field space .",
    "the form is symplectic ( non - degenerate ) on the enlarged phase space parametrised by the variables @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and the spatial gauge field @xmath34 , where the conditions that the @xmath92 are fixed and that @xmath34 satisfies are not imposed .",
    "both of these conditions are first class constraints , so to obtain the physical phase space we need to impose the constraints and divide the phase space by the gauge transformations generated by these constraints .",
    "in addition , we have to divide by the gauge transformations arising from the redundant parametrisation .",
    "the form @xmath128 then determines a unique symplectic structure on the physical phase space .    in practice",
    "it is often difficult or impossible to write down an explicit formula for the symplectic structure on the physical phase space .",
    "however , in many situations it is possible to describe the symplectic structure in terms of a two - form @xmath128 on an auxiliary space , in the following referred to as extended phase space and denoted by @xmath129 , with some ( preferably most ) but not all of the gauge freedom divided out .",
    "the remaining gauge freedom is encoded in a set of constraints defining a constraint surface @xmath130 , on which this two - form @xmath128 agrees with the pull - back of the symplectic structure on the physical phase space .    for chern - simons theory on a spatial surface @xmath82 of genus @xmath3 and with @xmath5 ordinary punctures , such a description has been achieved by alekseev and malkin @xcite .",
    "they consider the case of a simple , complex gauge group @xmath30 with fixed @xmath30-conjugacy classes associated to each puncture . in their description",
    ", the phase space is parametrised in terms of a finite set of variables linked to the holonomies along the generators of the surface s fundamental group , and its symplectic structure is given in terms of its pull - back to the manifold @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is a fixed cartan subgroup .    in our derivation of the symplectic structure defined by we",
    "closely follow the method introduced by alekseev and malkin @xcite . however , we extend their formalism to deal with the distinguished puncture at @xmath11 where the curvature is not restricted to lie in a fixed conjugacy class .",
    "the resulting extended phase space @xmath129 is the manifold @xmath133 , where the first @xmath134 copies of @xmath0 correspond the generators of the surface s @xmath2 fundamental group , the last copy stands for the element @xmath135 and @xmath74 parametrises the element @xmath66 in .",
    "the symplectic form @xmath128 determines a two - form on this space which we also denote by @xmath128 , and for which we derive an explicit formula .    as",
    "the derivation of this two - form is both lengthy and technical , we start by outlining the main steps in the method introduced in @xcite . the first step is to cut the spatial surface @xmath2 along a set of generators of its fundamental group , which results in a simply connected polygon and @xmath4 punctured discs .",
    "the second step is to trivialise the gauge field on the polygon and to decompose it into a regular and a singular component on the punctured discs .",
    "the integral in can then be transformed into a set of boundary integrals along each cut .",
    "finally , one relates the boundary integrals on the two sides of each cut by means of a continuity condition on the gauge field . after evaluating and summing the two boundary integrals in this way",
