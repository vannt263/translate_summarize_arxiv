    "neutron star black hole binaries are thought to be excellent candidates for ground - based gravitational wave ( gw ) detection ( e.g. belczynski et al .",

    "if their true coalescence rate is close to the upper end of the estimated values , neutron star black hole systems may be among the first sources detected .",
    "they are further -together with double neutron star systems- the favoured model for the subclass of short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; paczynski 1992 , narayan et al .",
    "1992 ) ; a coincident detection of a gravitational wave `` chirp '' signal together with a grb could be the ultimate proof for the compact binary nature of the short grb progenitors .",
    "moreover , the cold decompression of nuclear matter by the tidal disruption of a neutron star has been considered as a possible production site of rapid neutron capture elements ( lattimer and schramm , 1974 , 1976 ; lattimer et al .",

    "freiburghaus et al . 1999 ) . + full general relativistic simulations of this event are very challenging as apart from the complicated neutron star physics also the dynamic evolution of the space - time has to be followed since the systems of interest have comparable masses for both binary components and therefore a fixed space - time can not be assumed .",
    "but the dynamics of the event is demanding enough even if treated in the newtonian approximation .",
    "simulations of neutron star black hole encounters have been described in a series of papers by lee / lee and kluzniak ( lee and kluzniak 1999a , 1999b , lee 2000 , lee 2001 ) .",

    "+ the focus of our investigation in this paper is the complex accretion dynamics in a neutron star black hole system . many of the ( analytical ) approximations that are successfully used in other accreting systems are of only limited value in this context .",
    "for example , the roche - potential of point mass binaries is only a rough approximation to the neutron star with its rather flat density profile ; neutron star black hole binaries are most likely not corotating like other close binaries ( bildsten and cutler 1992 ) and , due to their tiny pressure scale heights in the neutron star surface , standard estimates of the distance where mass transfer sets in can only give a very rough guideline . + we present in sect . 2 analytic estimates that explain why irrotational donor stars do generally form accretion disks easier than corotating donors .",

    "3 our numerical methods and initial conditions , results concerning the accretion dynamics and the corresponding gravitational wave emission are presented in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 we summarize our results .",
    "while the gravitational wave signature is predominantly determined by the bulk motion of the event , the neutrino and electromagnetic signals from a neutron star black hole system require an accretion disk to form",
    ". moreover an accretion disk is thought to be an indispensable ingredient for a grb central engine ( e.g. piran 1999 , meszarosz 2002 ) .",
    "therefore we explore with simple analytical formulae the conditions under which a disk can form .",
    "+ we want to point out the fact that the following estimates only have illustrative character since they are very approximate for two reasons : first , the used formulae refer to roche - geometry , i.e. to the gravity of point masses , while the stiff neutron star equation of state leads to an almost uniform mass distribution inside the neutron star .",
    "second and more important , the stiff neutron star equation of state results in tiny pressure scale heights in the neutron star surface and therefore the level of uncertainty in the estimate of the roche radius can easily correspond to several orders of magnitude in terms of pressure scale heights .",
    "+ the dynamics of how the mass transfer proceeds depends crucially on the way the neutron star reacts on mass loss , i.e. whether it shrinks or expands .",
    "the mass - radius relationship of a polytropic neutron star with adiabatic exponent @xmath0 is given by ( e.g. kippenhahn 1990 ) r m^(-2)/(3 - 4 ) , i.e. for @xmath1 2 the radius is independent of the mass and for larger ( smaller ) values the neutron star shrinks ( expands ) on mass loss .",
    "for a realistic nuclear equation of state @xmath0 is density dependent ( for an example see the comparison between the shen- and the lattimer - swesty - eos in rosswog and davies 2002 , figure 5 ) and therefore the reaction of the neutron star on mass loss depends on its current mass .",
    "the mass - radius relationship of the used shen - eos is given in fig .",
    "[ m_r_shen ] . above 0.4",
    "a neutron star will shrink upon mass loss , below this value its radius increases .",
    "+      we show that -and explain why- it is in general easier to form an accretion disk due to roche lobe overflow , if the donor star is non - rotating rather than being tidally locked . in the non - rotating case ,",
    "matter flowing accross the lagrange point @xmath2 has a larger specific angular momentum and therefore yields a larger circularization radius than in the corotating case . as a consequence , in the first case more matter can form an accretion disk outside the schwarzschild radius , while for a corotating donor the bulk of material is fed directly into the hole .",
    "+ for the sake of simplicity we assume in the following that the roche potential is a valid approximation for our purposes .",
    "we further neglect radial velocities of the binary components and tidal deformations and lag angles of the donor star .",
    "generally , the circularization radius is an estimate for the initial disk size .",
    "it is proportional to the square of the specific angular momentum , @xmath3 , of the accretion stream at the @xmath2 point as measured in a coordinate system ( @xmath4 ) with non - rotating axes and the origin centred on the black hole , r_circ= l_l_1",

    "it is a vital ingredient for these calculations to start out from initial conditions as accurate as possible since the whole dynamical evolution is sensitive to the starting configuration .",

    "we consider the uncertainty in the basic physics at supranuclear densities and the sensitivity of the system dynamics to this part of the eos to be the decisive factors for the differences in the results .",
    "there are not many equations of state for the purpose of such simulations ( temperature dependent , large range of densities , no @xmath78-equilibrium assumed ) available , the used examples of the lattimer - swesty eos ( simulations of janka et al . 1999 ) and the shen - eos ( our simulations ) may therefore indicate the possible range of results as a function of the poorly known input physics .",
    "+ in most cases huge tidal tails of decompressed neutron star material form . during the decompression phase the adiabatic exponent drops from values above 3 to values close to 4/3 .",
    "this goes along with a recombination of nucleons into nuclei and therefore the release of several mev per nucleon .",
    "these effects drive a rapid lateral expansion of the tidal tails that will therefore end up as large , structured disks around the hole .",
    "+ the gravitational wave luminosity reaches peak values close to @xmath79 erg / s at the first encounter .",
    "the survival of the mini neutron star leaves a clear imprint on the gravitational wave signature .",
    "all the subsequent periastron approaches yield a luminosity peak roughly two orders of magnitude below the value of the first close approach . in our extreme case with mass ratio close to one",
    "both amplitudes and luminosity die off abruptly once the mini neutron star is finally disrupted .",
    "thus a softening of the equation of state at supranuclear densities due to , for example , hyperon condensates would be directly observable in the gravitational wave signature of a neutron star black hole system .     +   +",

    "we treat gravitational waves in the quadrupole approximation ( see e.g. misner et al . 1973 ) .",

    "<S> . therefore , the matter from a neutron star without spin will more likely settle into an accretion disk outside the schwarzschild radius . with the used stiff equation of state we find it hard to form an accretion disk that is promising to launch a gamma - ray burst . </S>",
    "<S> in all relevant cases the core of the neutron star survives and keeps orbiting the black hole as a mini neutron star for the rest of the simulation time ( up to several hundred dynamical neutron star times scales ) . </S>",
