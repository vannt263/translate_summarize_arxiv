    "in the early days of particle physics , chew , goldberger and others tried to account for resonances in terms of particle exchanges @xcite .",
    "this met with partial success .",
    "for @xmath3 elastic scattering , donnachie and hamilton @xcite showed that exchanges of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 provide long range attraction in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 partial waves where prominent resonances are observed .",
    "furthermore , these exchanges account for repulsive partial waves @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . however , meson exchanges failed to account for the @xmath6 meson .",
    "this approach was therefore quickly overtaken by the quark model , which has provided a semi - quantitative picture of most of the known resonances .",
    "however , there are cracks in this framework .",
    "firstly , it does not account for the @xmath7 and @xmath17 poles , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "secondly , there are many examples where resonances appear at or close to sharp s - wave thresholds : e.g. @xmath19 and @xmath18 at the @xmath20 threshold , @xmath21 at the @xmath22 threshold , @xmath23 at the @xmath24 threshold , @xmath25 and @xmath26 close to the @xmath27 threshold .",
    "there is a straightforward explanation of how s - wave thresholds attract these resonances @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath19 as an example .",
    "its amplitude for @xmath28 is given to first approximation by the flatt ' e formula @xcite : @xmath29 } = \\frac { n(s)}{d(s)}\\ ] ] where phase space @xmath6 is factored out of @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are coupling constants , @xmath33 are form factors . writing @xmath34 , a more exact form for @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37    fig .",
    "1(a ) illustrates the dispersive term @xmath38 for @xmath19 using @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is @xmath41 momentum in gev / c .",
    "@xmath42 acts as an effective attraction .",
    "parameters of @xmath19 are known .",
    "@xcite gives tables of pole positions when @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are varied . if @xmath43 is as low as 500 mev , there is still a pole at @xmath46 mev ; for @xmath43 in the range 8501100 mev , there is a pole within 23 mev of the @xmath41 threshold .",
    "the moral is that a strong threshold can move a resonance a surprisingly long way . for @xmath19 , @xmath47 gev@xmath48 .",
    "-8 mm -6 mm    it is important to realise that @xmath42 is not an ` optional extra ' .",
    "it is a rigorous consequence of analyticity for all @xmath49-channel decay processes . in principle",
    "these terms are required for all resonance decays .",
    "it is then logical to include also @xmath50- and @xmath51-channel exchanges .",
    "p - wave thresholds lead to broader effects because of the @xmath52 momentum dependence of phase space .",
    "there are in principle contributions to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , but in practice these effects may be accomodated by fitted form factors describing decay widths .",
    "the virtue of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is twofold .",
    "firstly , it is easily evaluated , secondly it illustrates graphically the effect of the form factor @xmath55 .",
    "re @xmath56 goes negative close to the peak of @xmath57 and subsequently has a minimum at @xmath58 gev ; thereafter it slowly rises to 0 as @xmath59 .",
    "there are alternatives to evaluating eq .",
    "the same result may be obtained by evaluating the loop diagram of fig .",
    "secondly , solving the bethe - salpeter equation is equivalent to evaluating all loop diagrams .",
    "it is straightforward in principle to include @xmath49- and @xmath50-channel exchanges in solving this equation .",
    "several authors have adopted a similar approach .",
    "jaffe @xcite gives the equations and discusses many of the implications in section 2c of his paper .",
    "the hamiltonian for a @xmath2 state decaying to meson - meson obeys @xmath60 @xmath61 describes short - range configurations ; @xmath62 refers to ingoing and outgoing states and should include @xmath50- and @xmath51-channel exchanges ; @xmath63 accounts for the coupling between them due to @xmath49-channel decays .",
    "weinstein and isgur pursued the connection between @xmath2 , @xmath64 and meson components in their work on @xmath20 molecules @xcite .",
    "van beveren and rupp @xcite construct a model where the short - range attraction in @xmath61 is approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential , which couples at radius @xmath65 to ingoing and outgoing waves corresponding to decay channels . despite the approximations , this gives valuable insight .",
    "their algebraic solution satisfies the schr \" odinger equation and is therefore fully analytic .",
    "it includes effects of thresholds fully , although not yet the @xmath49- and @xmath50-channel exchanges .",
    "barnes and swanson @xcite consider meson loops due to pairs of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 mesons , using the @xmath70 model for decays .",
    "for 1s , 1p and 2p charmonium states , they find that large mass shifts due to these loops may be ` hidden ' in the valence quark model by a change of parameters .",
    "the important conclusion from their work is that two - meson continuum components of charmonium states may be quite large , with the result that the constituent quark model predicts masses which are too high , particularly near the thresholds of opening channels .",
    "oset and collaborators demonstrate in a series of papers that some resonances may be understood as ` dynamically driven states ' @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite due to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51-channel exchanges .",
    "they take the view that @xmath71 and @xmath1 components are not needed at all in these cases .",
    "this takes us full circle back to the approach tried by chew .",
    "how is it that oset et al .",
    "are able to reproduce known resonances ( approximately ) with meson exchanges alone ?",
    "they use s - wave form factors which are adjusted to get one predicted resonance of each paper at the right mass .",
    "resulting amplitudes are strong .",
    "the form factors may be mocking up short range @xmath2 components .",
    "the importance of their work is the demonstration that components derived from meson loops are large , and should be taken into account .    on the other hand , the well known @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "are interpreted naturally as @xmath78 states ( with tiny admixtures of the mesonic states to which they decay ) .",
    "therefore it is logical to include the @xmath78 component into all other resonances unless there is a good reason why not .",
    "one should not be deterred from invoking @xmath2 and @xmath1 components to get all resonances with their correct masses and widths .",
    "the central premise of the present paper is that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 play essential roles in all cases .",
    "this is different from approaches where only one of the two components in the hamiltonian contributes , for example the approach based on four - quark mesonic states .",
    "an approach which has recently been popular is to suppose that ` molecules ' are formed from @xmath79 configurations @xcite @xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the well known question over this approach is why so few tetraquarks are observed .",
    "vijande et al .",
    "@xcite throw light on this issue .",
    "they study the stability of pure @xmath80 and @xmath81 states in the absence of diquark interactions .",
    "they find that all 12 @xmath82 states with @xmath83 , 1 or 2 are unstable .",
    "their calculation points to the conclusion that such molecules are rare unless either ( i ) there are attractive diquark interactions , or ( ii ) coupling to meson - meson final states contributes , as proposed here .",
    "the layout of remaining sections is as follows .",
    "section 2 considers a useful analogy with the covalent bond in chemistry .",
    "this analogy helps visualise the main features of mixing .",
    "section 3 reviews approximations to be used in fitting data .",
    "section 4 considers @xmath7 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "section 5 discusses firstly @xmath23 and concludes , as do several authors , that data require a linear combination of @xmath78 and @xmath84 . next it reviews the status of light mesons with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the objective is to demonstrate that observed states lie close to straight line trajectories when masses squared are plotted against radial excitation number .",
    "there are some significant deviations attributable to thresholds .",
    "however , the overall picture is consistent with rather regularly spaced @xmath2 states consistent with regge trajectories .",
    "such trajectories are usually attributed to flux tubes joining @xmath2 pairs and expanding as spin @xmath88 increases .",
    "there is no obvious reason why dynamically generated states should follow such a regular sequence .",
    "section 6 makes remarks on desirable experiments and section 7 draws conclusions .",
    "the wave function @xmath89 of eq . ( 3 ) is a linear combination of @xmath2 ( or @xmath1 ) and unconfined mm ( or mb ) .",
    "the key point is that two attractive components @xmath61 and @xmath62 lower the eigenstate via the mixing . this is a purely quantum mechanical effect .",
    "there is a direct analogy with the covalent bond in chemistry .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is given by the breit - rabi equation : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are eigenvalues of separate @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one linear combination is pulled down in energy .    in chemistry , @xmath93 is in principle known exactly .",
    "the discussion of the hydrogen molecule ( and more complex ones ) is given in many textbooks on physical chemistry , for example the one of atkins @xcite .",
    "consider two hydrogen atoms labelled a and b , combining to make a hydrogen molecule ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 describe a and b. the equation describing this pair is precisely the same as eq .",
    "( 3 ) . except that @xmath61 and @xmath62 have a different radial dependence to the mesonic case .",
    "2(a ) sketches contours of electron density for the lower state of eq .",
    "the effect of the mixing is that the electron density adjusts so that the two electrons are somewhat concentrated between the two ions . in more detail ,",
    "the wave - function for the atomic molecule is expanded in terms of a complete set of atomic h orbitals . for hydrogen , these are just the energy levels of a single hydrogen atom . for a carbon atom ,",
    "they are replaced by wave functions allowing for shielding of the coulomb field of the nucleus by electrons in the lowest atomic levels .",
    "it is also necessary to anti - symmetrise wave functions .",
    "atkin gives algebraic forms which approximate the electronic wave functions . with modern computing techniques ,",
    "the variational method adjusts the coefficients of the expansion in terms of excited states to describe wave functions with great accuracy .",
    "-20 mm -20 mm    two key points are that ( a ) the extension of the wave function into the overlap region lowers momenta of electrons , hence their kinetic energy , ( b ) the whole system shrinks slightly and the binding of electrons to both nuclei increases .    in the particle physics case ,",
    "the procedure is conceptually identical .",
    "the mesonic wave function for the ground state is sucked into the region of overlap , producing an attractive interaction between @xmath2 and meson - meson .",
    "this implies that @xmath2 will decay to final states where the interaction is indeed attractive .",
    "2(b ) shows the electron density for the upper state of eq .",
    "( 4 ) . in this case , electrons are repelled from the overlap region , increasing their momenta and kinetic energies , hence the energy eigenvalue .",
    "the second effect is that the increased binding for the lower state draws the quarks slightly down the coulombic part of the qcd potential , shrinking the radius of the state .",
    "the converse happens for the upper state .",
    "calculation of the mixing requires the radial wave functions of @xmath2 states , which can be evaluated from the funnel potential . a difficulty , however , is that the radial form of the mixing element @xmath63 between @xmath2 and @xmath94 parts of the wave function is unknown , and has to be guessed .",
    "the calculations of oset et al .",
    "concern purely the mesonic part of the wave function .",
    "the conceptual analogy is simple : mixing between @xmath2 and meson - meson will lower the eigenvalue of the lower of the two states given by ( 4 ) .",
    "the variational principle governs this eigenvalue and the wave function .",
    "the numerator of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is positive definite .",
    "it is therefore unavoidable that @xmath95 goes negative at large @xmath49 .",
    "the variational principle will cut off the high mass tail of the resonance , so as to minimise the repulsive part of @xmath96 , hence reducing the resonance width .",
    "a feature of light @xmath2 and @xmath1 resonances is that their widths are roughly equal to the spacing between radial excitations .",
    "it is likely that widths are restricted to this value by a feedback mechanism which creates an orderly sequence of resonances .",
    "a general feature of decays of high mass resonances is that s - wave decays to low mass final states are weak .",
    "decays tend to be to high mass configurations with small momenta .",
    "high spin states generally decay with large angular momenta , where the centrifugal barrier delays the opening of the threshold .",
    "there is little evidence for decays to @xmath97 @xmath98 pairs or @xmath99 , where interactions are repulsive @xcite .",
    "the commonly observed su(3 ) octets and decuplets are those whose decays do _ not _ lead to such repulsive final states .",
    "higher representions such as * 27 * , * 10 * and @xmath100 do lead to such repulsive final states .",
    "the natural interpretation is that repulsive final states actively inhibit formation of representations higher than octets and decuplets .",
    "the variational principle arranges that the configurations produced are those where repulsive final states are suppressed .",
    "a difficulty at present is that the form factor used in fig . 1 is not known precisely . the usual flatt ' e formula , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , serves as an approximate fitting function where @xmath43 and @xmath101 are fitted empirically .",
    "however , the cusp changes slope abruptly at the @xmath41 threshold .",
    "analysis of data then requires a precise knowledge of experimental resolution if the cusp is included in the fit .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath18 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where crystal barrel data on @xmath102 are fitted including the cusp .",
    "the mass resolution , 9.5 mev , is known accurately in this case , but is large enough to smear out the cusp seriously .",
    "the cusp plays a strong role if the energy resolution is as good as 1 mev .",
    "a further detail is that separate thresholds for @xmath103 and @xmath104 have not been used in fig . 1 for simplicity ; these two thresholds may be taken into account straightforwardly and the equations are given by achasov and shestakov @xcite .",
    "although broad thresholds may play a role in forming a resonance , the dispersive term @xmath42 eventually has only a small effect on the experimental line - shape in most cases .",
    "there is , however , a crucial detail which has often been neglected in fits to data .",
    "let us consider as an example @xmath105 .",
    "the breit - wigner amplitude in this case is @xmath106 here , @xmath107 is the @xmath98 centre of mass momentum ( allowing for the incident flux ) .",
    "the @xmath98 phase space is approximately constant .",
    "however , it is essential to allow for the rapid @xmath49-dependence of @xmath108 .",
    "many experimental analyses ignore this point and fit @xmath109 to a breit - wigner resonance of constant width .",
    "this is a critical point for many resonances in the mass range 12 gev , where thresholds are opening .",
    "3(a ) shows line - shapes of @xmath110 and @xmath111 as an example .",
    "there is a large difference between them .",
    "this is the source of the large spread in masses reported by the particle data group ( pdg ) for @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "anisovich et al .",
    "@xcite determine the k - matrix pole position @xmath113 mev from a combined analysis of data on @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and crystal barrel data for @xmath117 at rest @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 ; the last three determine p - state annihilation .",
    "this analysis did not explicitly allow for @xmath95 in the denominator .",
    "that was taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite , resulting in a mass of @xmath127 mev , in close agreement with anisovich et al .",
    "the peak in @xmath111 , if judged from the mean of half - heights , is 1377 mev , in good agreement with the determination of mass from @xmath111 data quoted by the pdg .",
    "-10 mm -6 mm    the argand diagram from ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "it follows a circle closely .",
    "the conclusion is that experimentalists can safely omit @xmath42 as a first approximation .",
    "however , phase shifts depart significantly from a breit - wigner amplitude of constant width . at low mass , where @xmath111 phase space is small",
    ", @xmath128 is small and the phase shift varies rapidly ; at high mass it varies more slowly . for high quality data , a second pass including",
    "@xmath38 is desirable    likewise @xmath129 and @xmath130 may be fitted as two decay modes of a single @xmath131 @xcite . the @xmath130 is seen only in @xmath132 , where phase space rises from threshold near 1385 mev as momentum cubed in the final state ; the @xmath129 is seen in @xmath133 s - waves and @xmath134 where phase space changes slowly .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath17 poles are well predicted in both mass and width by the roy equations @xcite @xcite , which are based on @xmath50- and @xmath51-channel exchanges .",
    "exchange of @xmath53 and @xmath135 make strong contributions .",
    "the julich group of janssen et al .",
    "@xcite showed that meson exchanges account for @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "it seems unavoidable that all four states @xmath7 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are strongly driven by meson exchanges .",
    "they are conspicuous because @xmath2 states lie in the mass range 13001700 mev .",
    "there is one feature , however , which is hidden in the meson exchanges going into the roy equations .",
    "they impose the adler zero coming from chiral symmetry breaking . this is a short - range effect .",
    "jaffe has proposed @xcite that @xmath7 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are colourless 4-quark states made from a coloured su(3 ) * 3 * combination of @xmath136 and a @xmath137 combination of @xmath138 .",
    "this naturally leads to a light @xmath7 , an intermediate @xmath17 and the highest ( degenerate ) masses for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in agreement with experiment .",
    "note , however that meson - meson configurations lead to a similar spectrum except that the @xmath18 might lie at the @xmath139 threshold .",
    "this does not happen because of the nearby adler zero at @xmath140 ; the @xmath18 migrates to the @xmath41 threshold because the adler zero in this case is distant , at @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "jaffe s model does not agree well with the observed decay branching ratio @xmath142 near 1 gev .",
    "@xcite a serious problem is that , from the width of the @xmath7 pole , the @xmath17 width is predicted to be @xmath143 mev , much less than the latest value : @xmath144 mev @xcite .",
    "a further point is that maiani et al .",
    "@xcite extend jaffe s scheme to @xmath145[\\bar qq]$ ] configurations @xmath146 .",
    "they give a firm prediction for the observation of analogues of @xmath18 in @xmath147 with @xmath148 and charges 0 , + 1 and + 2 .",
    "there is no evidence for such states as yet .",
    "although experimental line - shapes are not affected strongly for broad resonances , one should not jump to the conclusion that broad resonances are pure @xmath2 states .",
    "the calculations of oset et al . show that mesonic components are potentially large .",
    "a related point is what happens to the upper energy combinations appearing in eq .",
    "if mesonic components are large , these upper combinations are moved upwards substantially . as jaffe remarks , they become broad and are likely to fall apart , creating a broad high mass background .",
    "the high mass tail of the @xmath7 does behave in this sort of way above 1 gev , due to coupling to @xmath111 @xcite ; however , the precise form of this high mass behaviour is poorly known because of lack of data on @xmath149 .",
    "it is evident from the width of the cusp in @xmath150 of fig .",
    "1 that a cusp alone fails to fit the @xmath151 mev width of @xmath23 @xcite ; the coupling to @xmath84 is weaker than that of @xmath19 to @xmath41 , but the shape of the dispersion curve is similar .    several authors conclude that a linear combination of @xmath78 and @xmath84 is likely in @xmath23 .",
    "eichten et al .",
    "@xcite remark that this explains the low mass of @xmath23 compared to early calculations based purely on @xmath78 .",
    "suzuki @xcite points out that the large production rate of @xmath23 in cdf data from the tevatron @xcite requires that it has a large wave function at the origin , hence a substantial @xmath78 component ; for a pure molecular state the observed production rate is nearly 2 orders of magnitude smaller than cdf observe .",
    "conversely , the molecular re - arrangements @xmath152 and @xmath153 account naturally for the weak decays which are observed ; here , the strength of @xmath84 binding is unimportant .",
    "bignamini et al .",
    "confirm that the cdf production rate is about 2 orders of magnitude too large to be explained by a molecular component alone @xcite .",

    "the prediction of swanson for a pure molecule is @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "also gutsche et al .",
    "conclude that some component of @xmath78 is essential to explain the large rate for @xmath162 @xcite .",

    "however , the coupling to @xmath84 rises rapidly above threshold and produces the binding via virtual loop diagrams .",

    "( v ) the @xmath200 @xcite observed by bes 2 and babar in @xmath201 and @xmath202 makes a natural @xmath203 partner for @xmath193 .",
    "note that there is sufficient momentum in the final state to allow a @xmath187 state .",
    "the @xmath21 lies at the @xmath205 threshold .",
    "the pdg quotes an average mass of @xmath206 mev , although baker et al .",
    "@xcite find a mass of @xmath207 mev when @xmath38 is included in the analysis .",
    "this is distinctly lower than the mass of @xmath208 , in the range 16601732 mev . for almost massless quarks ,",
    "one expects @xmath209 and @xmath210 masses to be close .",
    "so @xmath21 has clearly been attracted to the @xmath205 threshold .",
    "this requires a molecular component .",
    "the @xmath21 appears clearly in @xmath98 , as observed by several groups @xcite .",
    "it should appear in @xmath211 with @xmath212 by su(2 ) symmetry , which predicts @xmath213 because of the similar masses of light quarks and the close masses of @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the @xmath216 observed by gams and ves @xcite may be fitted by folding the line - shape of @xmath21 with @xmath205 phase space and a reasonable form factor @xcite , together with the dispersive term @xmath95 .",
    "there is no need for separate @xmath21 and @xmath217 ; this has confused a number of theoretical predictions of the sequence of @xmath86 states .",
    "2(b ) shows trajectories for @xmath218 states , including those above the @xmath117 threshold from crystal barrel data in flight , using trajectories with a slope of 1.14 gev@xmath48 .",
    "the pdg makes a number of serious errors in reporting the crystal barrel publications .",
    "those mistakes distort conclusions to be drawn from the data .",
    "it lists @xmath219 under @xmath220 , which is observed in @xmath221 and @xmath41 by all other groups .",
    "the @xmath220 is naturally interpreted as an @xmath203 state .",
    "both @xmath219 and @xmath222 are observed in a combined analysis of ten sets of data : four sets of ps172 and eisenhandler et al .",
    ", together with crystal barrel data for @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the data from the last 3 channels are fitted to a linear combination @xmath229 and the mixing angle is determined to be @xmath230 for @xmath231 and @xmath232 for @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "so the @xmath219 is certainly not an @xmath203 state . from polarisation data ,",
    "the @xmath219 is dominantly @xmath233 with @xmath234 ( defined like @xmath197 ) and the @xmath220 is largely @xmath235 with @xmath236 .",
    "the pdg fails to list the @xmath222 at all , despite many prompts over a 6 year period .",
    "it is observed in 5 channels : @xmath98 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "a further comment is that the @xmath239 is conspicuous by its absence from crystal barrel data in flight .",
    "all @xmath203 states such as @xmath240 are produced very weakly in @xmath117 interactions .",
    "the @xmath239 is observed mostly in @xmath20 and @xmath227 channels .",
    "it is therefore naturally interpreted as an @xmath203 state , the partner of @xmath241 .",
    "an important systematic observation is that @xmath117 states tend to decay with the same @xmath242 as the initial @xmath117 state .",
    "there is a simple explanation , namely good overlap of the initial and final states in impact parameter",
    ". this observation may be useful to those calculating decays , hence mesonic contributions to eqns .",
    "( 1)(4 ) .",
    "there is extensive evidence for a radial excitation of @xmath112 at 1790 mev .",
    "the facts run as follows .",
    "in bes 2 data for @xmath243 , there is a clear @xmath244 @xcite . in high statistics data for @xmath245 ,",
    "@xcite there is no visible @xmath246 , setting a limit on branching ratios : @xmath247 with 95% confidence .",
    "thirdly , in @xmath248 , there is a @xmath98 peak requiring an _ additional _ @xmath249 decaying to @xmath98 but weakly to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "there is ample independent evidence for it in @xmath250 @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xmath251 in flight @xcite .",
    "bes 2 also report an @xmath252 peak of 95 events at 1812 mev ; @xmath253 is favoured @xcite .",
    "it is confirmed by ves data at the hadron09 conference @xcite .",
    "the bes data may be fitted well with the @xmath249 line - shape folded with @xmath252 phase space and a form factor @xmath254 .",
    "there is some scatter on fig .",
    "4(c ) of masses about the line of standard slope ; this may well be because masses of @xmath87 states tend to be the most difficult to deterine due to isotropic angular distributions .",
    "a comment is needed on @xmath255 of the particle data tables .",
    "it does not fit in naturally in fig .",
    "the spin analysis of the gams group @xcite finds a very marginal difference between spin 0 and spin 2 .",
    "it rests on a fine distinction in the angular distribution depending strongly on experimental acceptance ; however , no monte carlo of the acceptance is shown . with the benefit of hindsight",
    ", it seems possible that this was in fact the first observation of @xmath249 .",
    "summarising subsections 5.3 to 5.5 , there is strong evidence in figs .",
    "4(a)-(c ) that resonances lie close to straight trajectories as a function of mass squared .",
    "these may be redrawn as regge trajectories for @xmath256 , @xmath86 , @xmath257 , etc .",
    ", see fig .",
    "56 of @xcite .",
    "regge trajectories are naturally explained by a flux tube joining @xmath258 and @xmath259 ; the energy stored in the flux tube explains the linear relation between @xmath88 and mass squared .",
    "there is no clear reason why molecules or dynamically generated states should follow such trajectories .",
    "morningstar and peardon @xcite predict glueball masses in the quenched approximation where @xmath2 are omitted . when mixing with @xmath2",
    "is included , mixing is likely to lower glueball masses .",
    "further progress towards a complete spectroscopy of light mesons and baryons is important for an understanding of confinement - one of the key phase transitions in physics .",
    "progress is possible by measuring transverse polarisation in formation processes .",
    "consider @xmath117 as an example .",
    "the high spin states appear clearly as peaks , e.g. @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "these serve as interferometers for lower states .",
    "however , differential cross sections measure only real parts of interferences .",
    "this leaves the door open to two - fold ambiguities in relative phases and large errors if resonances happen to be orthogonal . a measurement of transverse polarisation normal to the plane of scattering measures @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is the amplitude .",
    "this measures the imaginary part of interferences .",
    "what appears to be less well known is that transverse polarisation in the plane of scattering gives additional information for three and four - body final states with a decay plane different to the plane defined by the beam and initial state polarisation .",
    "this depends on @xmath264 , and measures the real parts of exactly the same interferences as appear from the @xmath265 operator .",
    "longitudinal polarisation depends only on differences of two intensities and is less useful .",
    "an example of a simple experiment which would pay a rich dividend is to measure such polarisations with the crystal barrel detector at the forthcoming gsi @xmath266 source , over the same mass range as used at lear .",
    "an extracted beam with these momenta will be available at the flair ring .",
    "such measurements could indeed have been made at lear if it had not been sacrificed to the funding of the lhc .",
    "the present situation is that the amplitudes for @xmath267 , @xmath268 states are unique for all expected @xmath172 . for @xmath148 , @xmath269 , they are nearly complete , but there are some weaknesses for low spin states , notably @xmath180 which leads to a flat decay angular distribution . for @xmath148 , @xmath268",
    "there is a two - fold ambiguity for @xmath139 final states and crucial @xmath253 states are missing . for @xmath267 , @xmath269",
    "there are many missing states .",
    "the measurements required are to ( i ) @xmath139 and @xmath270 ( @xmath148 , @xmath271 ) , ( ii ) @xmath272 ( @xmath148 , @xmath269 ) , ( iii ) @xmath273 and @xmath274 ( @xmath267 , @xmath269 ) .",
    "a measurement of @xmath223 would cross - check the existing solution and provide information on interferences between singlet and triplet @xmath117 states . as well as locating missing states",
    ", this would build up a clear picture of the many decays observable , for comparision with meson exchange processes .",
    "all of these channels can be measured simultaneously with the existing crystal barrel detector .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of results extrapolated from existing analyses predicts a unique set of amplitudes for all quantum numbers .",
    "data are required from 2 gev / c down to the lowest possible momentum @xmath275 mev / c .",
    "seven of the nine momenta studied at lear were run in 3 months of beam time , so it is not a long experiment , nor does it demand beam intensities above @xmath276 .",
    "a monte carlo study shows that backgrounds from heavy nuclei in the polarised target ( and its cryostat ) should be at or below an average level of 10% ; this is comparable with cross - talk between final states and is easily measured from a dummy target .",
    "baryon spectrocopy would also benefit from similar @xmath277 polarisation measurements in inelastic channels .",
    "a transverse magnetic field is required for compatibility with the polarised target .",
    "rates are enormous , so running time is governed by down - time required for polarising the target and changing momenta .",
    "data at 30 mev steps of mass appear sufficient , except close to 2-body thresholds such as @xmath27 .",
    "the objective of this paper has been to make a case for what appears logically necessary , namely that both quark combinations at short range and decay channels at large range contribute to the eigenstates .",
    "the @xmath23 is a prime example of mixing between @xmath78 and meson - meson in the form of @xmath84 .    in view of the calculations of oset",
    "et al . and barnes and swanson",
    ", it seems likely that many resonances contain large mesonic contributions .",
    "the straight trajectories of figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) are naturally explained by regge phenomenology ; molecules and dynamically generated states provide no obvious explanation of these trajectories . the large mass shift between @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath208 indicates meson mixing into @xmath21 , lowering the eigenvalue in analogy with the covalent bond in chemistry .",
    "the data on @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath278 fit naturally into this picture .",
    "there must be a large mesonic contribution to the nonet of @xmath7 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but there could be a modest diquark component as well .",
    "it is likely that there will be a small @xmath2 component , but this is suppressed by the @xmath279 centrifugal barrier for @xmath70 combinations .",
    "experimentalists must take care to fit the @xmath49-dependence of the numerator of breit - wigner resonances due to phase space , e.g. @xmath280 has a very different line - shape to @xmath281 .",
    "the denominator may be fitted as a first approximation with a breit - wigner resonances of constant width ; however , for high quality data , the effect of the dispersive component in the real part of the denominator matters . for sharp thresholds , e.g. @xmath282 ,",
    "the flatt ' e formula is an approximation ; with high quality data , the correction due to the cusp in re @xmath283 is important , but requires precise information on experimental resolution",
