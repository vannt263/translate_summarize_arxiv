    "photon correlation measurement has played an important role in physical science . since the second - order correlation ( soc ) or two - photon correlation measurement was first devised by hanbury - brown and twiss to resolve the size of stars @xcite , it has been utilized in various fields from ultra - cold atomic systems @xcite to single molecule fluorescence @xcite . as more efficient measurement schemes have been developed @xcite , many researchers has begun to address higher - order correlation functions in various aspects .",

    "_ @xcite observed higher - order photon bunching effects in a semiconductor microcavity laser .",
    "asymmetric temporal behavior of three - photon correlation in a strongly driven atom - cavity system was studied by m. koch _ et al .",
    "higher - order photon correlation is also used in doppler optical coherence tomography @xcite as well as in high - order ghost imaging @xcite . in matter wave experiments , the third - order correlation of bose - einstein condensates was investigated to confirm its bose statistics @xcite .",
    "one of the main benefits obtainable from the photon correlation measurement is the information on photon statistics .",
    "for instance , the normalized variance of photon statistics is simply described in terms of the soc as @xmath2 . here , @xmath3 is the photon number , @xmath4 with @xmath5 is the second - order correlation and the left - hand side is usually called mandel q factor .",
    "the second - order- and furthermore the higher - order correlation functions give us useful information on photon statistics of a light source . in describing the statistical distribution of photon numbers ,",
    "people frequently use the more generalized quantities called skewness and kurtosis , which are related with the third and forth - order correlations , respectively .",
    "these quantities give graphical and intuitive information on photon statistics , describing how much the distribution is asymmetrical and sharp , respectively .    in photon",
    "correlation measurements , @xmath0 separate photodetectors are used for the @xmath0th - order correlation function in most configurations . for soc measurement , hanbury - brown - twiss - type measurement is often used .",
    "it may seem that this configuration would remove the detector dead time effect because two successive photons detected at separate detectors appear to be free from the dead time effect of each detector .",
    "unfortunately , the dead time effect on soc nevertheless exists even in this usual configuration and the distortion in soc is known to depend on the higher - order ( @xmath6 ) correlation functions @xcite . from this consideration",
    ", one can expect that it might be possible to extract the information on the higher - order correlations from the soc measurement by analyzing the dead time effect .",
    "this possible new scheme to measure the correlation by using the detector dead time effect will be called ` indirect measurement ' throughout the paper .",
    "however , most of the discussions in the literature @xcite are restricted to the case where the light source is classical and the correlation time is much larger than the mean waiting time or the inverse of the photodetection flux . on the other hand ,",
    "our previous study @xcite considered the dead time effect on non - classical light but neglected the higher - order correlations in deriving a correction formula .",
    "it is thus desirable to generalize all of these previous studies to cover both non - classical light sources and the higher - order correlations .    in this paper , we have theoretically derived an indirect measurement scheme for the third - order correlation by generalizing the previous studies on the dead time effect .",

    "<S> we have observed the three - photon correlation in nonclassical light sources by using an indirect measurement scheme based on the dead time effect of photon - counting detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we first developed a general theory which enables us to extract the three - photon correlation from the two - photon correlation of an arbitrary light source measured with detectors with finite dead times . </S>",
    "<S> we then confirmed the validity of our measurement scheme in experiments done with the cavity - qed microlaser operating with a large intra - cavity mean photon number exhibiting both sub- and super - poissonian photon statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results were in a good agreement with the theoretical expectation . </S>",
    "<S> our measurement scheme provides an alternative approach for @xmath0-photon correlation measurement employing @xmath1 detectors and thus a reduced measurement time for a given signal - to - noise ratio , compared to the usual scheme requiring @xmath0 detectors . </S>"
