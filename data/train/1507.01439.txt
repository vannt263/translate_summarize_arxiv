    "the shape of many a deformable object arises through the competition of multiple constraints on the object : this competition may be between different global constraints , such as in helfrich s analysis @xcite of the shape of a red blood cell ( where intrinsic curvature effects coexist with constrained membrane area and enclosed volume ) .",
    "it may also be the competition between local and global constraints .",
    "such deformations , which we shall term _ glocal _ , arise for example in origami patterns @xcite ( where local folds must be compatible with the global geometry ) .",
    "they are of considerable interest in the design of programmable materials @xcite at macro- and microscales , where one asks : can a sequence of local deformations overcome global constraints and direct the global deformations of an object ?    this is a problem that , at the close of their development , the embryos of the green alga _ volvox _",
    "@xcite are faced with in the ponds of this world .",
    "_ volvox _ ( fig .

    "[ fig1]b , e ) consists of a few thousand cells arrayed to form a thin spherical sheet @xcite .",
    "these cells are connected to each other by the remnants of incomplete cell division , thin membrane tubes called _ cytoplasmic bridges _",
    "the ends of the cells whence emanate the flagella , however , point into the sphere at this stage , and so the ability to swim is only acquired once the alga turns itself inside out through an opening at the top of the cell sheet , called the _ phialopore _ @xcite",
    ".    of particular interest in the present context is the crucial first step of this process , the formation of a circular invagination in so - called ` type b ' inversion ( fig .",

    "( this scenario is distinct from ` type a ' inversion in which the initial steps involve four lips which peel back from a cross - shaped phialopore . )",
    "the invaginations of cell sheets found in type b inversion are very generic deformations during morphogenetic events such as gastrulation and neurulation @xcite , but , in animal model organisms , they often arise from an intricate interplay of cell division , intercalation , migration and cell shape changes . modelling these",

    "@xcite , but simpler models of simpler morphogenetic processes are required to elucidate the underlying mechanics of these problems @xcite .",

    "simultaneously , the cytoplasmic bridges migrate to the wedge ends of the cells , thus splaying the cells locally and causing the cell sheet to bend @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) .",
    "additional cell shape changes have been implicated in the relative contraction of one hemisphere with respect to the other in order to facilitate invagination @xcite .",
    "after invagination , the bend region expands , allowing the posterior hemisphere to invert fully .    at a more physical level",
    ", it has been shown recently that the inversion process is simple enough to be amenable to a mathematical description @xcite : the deformations of the alga are well reproduced by a simple elastic model in which the cell shape changes and motion of cytoplasmic bridges impart local variations of intrinsic curvature and stretches to an elastic shell @xcite .",
    "the associated mechanics have remained unclear , however . here , we perform an asymptotic analysis at small deformations to clarify the geometric distinction between deformations resulting from intrinsic bending and intrinsic stretching , respectively . a numerical study of the bifurcation behavior further serves to illustrate how a sequence of local deformations can achieve invagination , and how contraction complements bending in this picture .",

    "@xcite , we inscribe _ volvox _ inversion into the very general framework of the axisymmetric deformations of a thin elastic spherical shell of radius @xmath5 and thickness @xmath6 under variations of its intrinsic curvature and stretches . the undeformed , spherical , configuration of the shell is characterized by arclength @xmath7 and the distance of the shell from its axis of revolution , @xmath8 ( fig .  [ fig1]g ) . to these correspond arclength @xmath9 and distance from the axis of revolution @xmath10 in the deformed configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]h ) .",
    "the undeformed and deformed configurations are related by the meridional and circumferential stretches , @xmath11 ( these definitions do not require that the undeformed configuration be spherical , and apply for the deformations of any axisymmetric object . ) these define the strains @xmath12 and curvature strains @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the meridional and circumferential curvatures of the deformed shell .",
    "the intrinsic curvatures and stretches introduced by @xmath16 and @xmath17 extend helfrich s work on membranes @xcite .",
    "the deformed configuration of the shell minimises an energy of the hookean form @xcite @xmath18 with material parameters the elastic modulus @xmath19 and poisson s ratio @xmath20 . in computations",
    ", we take @xmath21 and @xmath22 appropriate for _ volvox _ inversion @xcite .    in general , deformations of the shell",
    "arise from a complex interplay of intrinsic stretches and curvatures , and the global geometry of the shell . to clarify these , we begin by considering two simple kinds of deformations , in which the competition is between two effects only . how these effects conspire",
    "in general we shall explore in the main body of the paper .",
    "the simplest intrinsic deformation is one of uniform stretching or contraction , which does not affect the global , spherical geometry of the shell .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with these intrinsic stretches and curvatures , the original sphere deforms to a sphere of radius @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 , and so the strains are @xmath27 .",
    "however , @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath29 , and so @xmath30 .",
    "the energy density is therefore proportional to @xmath31 and is minimized for @xmath32 , at which point @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "( indeed , uniform contraction is a homothetic transformation : the angles between material points are unchanged , and so there is no bending involved . in other words ,",
    "the shell is blind to its intrinsic curvature on this spherical solution branch . )",
    "the intrinsic stretches and curvatures need not be compatible in this way , however : suppose that @xmath23 , but @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the energy still has spherical minima of radius @xmath32 , but now with @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "this illustrates that , conversely , even if the equilibrium shape is spherical , the intrinsic curvatures and stretches can not straightforwardly be inferred from the resulting shape .     in a plane elastic sheet by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "the boundary of this region is contracted to @xmath38 .",
    "( c )  numerical result for @xmath39 ( + ) agrees with analytical calculation ( [ eq : linear ] ) ( solid line ) . ]      to illustrate how the global geometry affects these deformations , we consider contraction of a plane elastic sheet , with @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( fig .",

    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "notice that the governing equation ( [ eq : ele ] ) is independent of the forcing applied away from @xmath49 ; the solution is determined by geometric boundary conditions .",
    "the most drastic cell shape changes at the start of inversion occur when cells in a narrow region close to the equator become wedge - shaped ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) .",
    "these are accompanied by motion of the cytoplasmic bridges to the thin tips of the cells to splay the cell sheet and drive its inward bending .",
    "for this reason , hhn  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite started by considering a piecewise constant functional form for the intrinsic curvature , in which this curvature took negative values in a narrow region close to the equator .",
    "it was found , however , that with this ingredient alone the energy minimizers could not reproduce the mushroom shapes adopted by the embryos in the early of stages of inversion ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , f ) , producing instead a shape cinched in at those points ",
    "the so - called ` purse - string ' effect",
    ". however , analysis of thin sections had previously revealed that the cells in the posterior hemisphere become thinner at the start of inversion @xcite .",
    "when the resulting contraction of the posterior hemisphere was incorporated into the model , it could indeed reproduce , quantitatively , the shapes of invaginating _ volvox _ embryos .",
    "hhn _ et al .",
    "_ have thus identified two different types of active deformations that contribute to the shapes of inverting _ volvox _ at the invagination stage : first , a localized region of active inward bending ( corresponding to negative intrinsic curvature ) , and second , relative contraction of one hemisphere with respect to the other .",
    "we shall focus on these two types of deformation in what follows and clarify the ensuing elastic and geometrical balances .",
    "we start by seeking equilibrium configurations in the limit of a thin shell , @xmath6 . in this limit , the shapes ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , b ) corresponding to contraction or ( pure ) invagination ( by which we mean , here , deformations driven by a region of high intrinsic curvature only ) result from the matching of spherical shells of different radii or disparate relative positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , d ) .",
    "deviations from these outer solutions are localized to an asymptotic inner layer of non - dimensional width @xmath53 about @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the angle that the normal to the undeformed shell makes with the vertical ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]e ) . here",
    ", we consider an incipient deformation where the normal angle @xmath56 to the deformed shell deviates but slightly from its value in the spherical configuration , viz @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "we begin by clarifying the geometric distinction between contraction and invagination .",
    "the radial and vertical displacements obey    [ eq : displ]@xmath59    where dashes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath60 , and where we have assumed the scaling @xmath61 which we shall derive presently .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the ( non - dimensional ) distance by which the posterior moves up .",
    "matching to the outer solutions requires the net displacements @xmath63 and @xmath64 , obtained by integrating ( [ eq : displ ] ) across the inner layer , to obey    @xmath65    where the superscripts ( c ) and",
    "( i ) refer , respectively , to the solutions corresponding to contraction and ( pure ) invagination . in the case of contraction , ( [ eq : displ ] ) and ( [ eq : totdc ] ) give the scaling @xmath66 .",
    "if there is no contraction , however , ( [ eq : displ ] ) and ( [ eq : totdnc ] ) imply that the leading - order solution does not yield any upward motion of the posterior , which is associated with a higher - order solution only .",
    "this suggests that the appropriate scaling is @xmath67 , which we shall verify presently .",
    "our assumption @xmath58 thus translates to @xmath68 .",
    "hence , in the invagination case , upward motion of the posterior requires comparatively large inward displacements of order @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]f ) .",
    "this asymptotic difference of the deformations corresponding to contraction and invagination arises purely from geometric effects ; it is the origin of the ` purse - string ' shapes found by hhn _",
    "_ in the absence of contraction @xcite .      here , we discuss the detailed solution for pure invagination . upon non - dimensionalising distances with @xmath5 and stresses with @xmath70 , the euler ",
    "lagrange equations of  ( [ eq : enf ] ) , derived in the appendix , can be cast into the form    [ eq : gov]@xmath71    with the small parameter @xmath72 in these equations , @xmath73 is the non - dimensional meridional stress , and @xmath74 is the dimensionless hoop strain .",
    "the contribution from the intrinsic curvature is @xmath75 the equations are closed by the geometric relation @xmath76 introducing @xmath77 , scaling gives the leading balances @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 in ( [ eq : gov],[eq : geo ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath81 , and we define an inner coordinate @xmath82 via @xmath83 . we also introduce the expansions    @xmath84    this further proves the scaling @xmath85 that we have assumed previously .",
    "the pure invagination configuration is forced by intrinsic curvature that differs from the curvature of the undeformed sphere in a region of width @xmath86 about @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .",
    "writing @xmath89 , we thus have , at leading order , @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and where h denotes the heaviside function .",
    "thus @xmath92 where @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath94 provided that @xmath95 ( which we shall assume to be the case ) ; thus we may set @xmath87 to the order at which we are working . expanding ( [ eq : gov],[eq : geo ] ) , we then find @xmath96 at lowest order , where dashes now denote differentiation with respect to @xmath82 . at next order ,    @xmath97    with @xmath98 .",
    "we are left to determine the matching conditions by expanding ( [ eq : displ ] ) to find    @xmath99    up to corrections of order @xmath100 .",
    "applying ( [ eq : totdnc ] ) , at lowest order , we find @xmath101 at next order , ( [ eq : totdnc ] ) is a system of two linear equations for two integrals , with solution @xmath102 we note in particular that the resulting condition on the leading - order solution has only arisen in the second - order expansion of the matching conditions .",
    "similarly , at order @xmath103 , we find @xmath104 the leading - order problem is thus @xmath105 with matching conditions ( [ eq : match1 ] ) and the first of ( [ eq : match2 ] ) .",
    "symmetry ensures that the first of ( [ eq : match1 ] ) is satisfied . after a considerable amount of algebra ,",

    "[ fig3]g ) .",
    "this is a first indication that narrow invaginations are more efficient than those resulting from wider regions of high intrinsic curvature , a statement that we shall make more precise later .",
    "symmetry also implies that there is no inward rotation of the midpoint of the invagination at this order .",
    "rather , inward folding is a second - order effect , for which we need to consider the second - order problem , @xmath110 with matching conditions ( [ eq : sym ] ) and the second of ( [ eq : match2 ] ) .",

    ", there is thus no geometric obstacle to inward folding ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]h ) .",
    "contraction is thus not only a means of creating the disparity in the radii of the anterior and posterior hemispheres required to fit the partly inverted latter into the former , but also drives the inward folding of the invagination , by breaking its symmetry . in _",

    "the asymptotic analysis has shown that the coupling of elasticity and geometry constrains small invagination - like deformations both locally and globally , but that contraction can help overcome these global constraints .",
    "these ideas carry over to larger deformations of the shell , which must however be studied numerically . for this purpose , we extend the setup of @xcite , motivated by direct observation of thin sections of fixed embryos : the intrinsic curvature @xmath121 differs from that of undeformed sphere in the range @xmath124 of arclength along the shell ( fig .",

    "see text for further explanation .",
    "]        at the distinguished value @xmath132 , a critical branch arises ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it separates two types of branches : first , those with @xmath133 , on which @xmath62 varies mononotonically with @xmath128 , and second , those with @xmath131 , where the relation between @xmath62 and @xmath128 is more complicated . at large values of @xmath86",
    ", these branches may have a rather involved topology involving loops . at values of @xmath86 just above @xmath134 , however , there is a range of values of @xmath128 for which there exist three configurations ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we note that the two outer configurations have @xmath135 , while the middle one has @xmath136 .",
    "the latter behaviour prefigures instability , which we shall discuss in more detail below .",
    "there are thus two points on these branches where @xmath128 , viewed locally as a function of @xmath62 , reaches an extremum .",
    "the curve joining up these extrema for different values of @xmath86 we shall term the ` spinodal curve ' .",
    "this curve , in turn , has a maximum at a point on the critical branch , which we shall call the ` critical point ' and which is characterised by  @xmath134 and the critical curvature , @xmath137 .",
    "the stability of the configurations in fig .  [ fig5 ] can be assessed by means of general results of bifurcation theory @xcite , used recently to discuss the stability of the buckled equilibrium shapes of a pressurised elastic spherical shell @xcite .",
    "if we let @xmath138 denote the conjugate variable to @xmath128 , the key result of @xcite is that stability , at fixed @xmath86 , of extremizers of the energy @xmath139 can be assessed from the folds in the @xmath140 bifurcation diagram . in particular , stability can only change at folds in the bifurcation diagram . expanding the bending part of the energy functional ( [ eq : enf ] ) for @xmath141 and @xmath142 , we find @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "( the last term in the integrand is independent of the solution , and may therefore be ignored in what follows . )    the two folds that arise in the @xmath145 diagram for @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) are compatible _ a priori _ with four fold topologies in the @xmath140 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ) .",
    "however , since a single solution exists for small @xmath128 ( at fixed @xmath86 ) , the lowest branch must be stable . further , since the branches do not self - intersect in the @xmath145 diagram , they can not self - intersect in the @xmath140 diagram either",
    ". the results of @xcite imply that only the first topology in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a is compatible with this , and so the fold is s - shaped and traversed upwards in the @xmath140 diagram .",
    "it follows in particular that the middle branch , with @xmath136 is unstable , and that right branch is stable .",
    "( numerically , one confirms that the branches are indeed s - shaped . )",
    "thus the stability of the branches in this simple bifurcation diagram could also be inferred from the @xmath145 diagram ( though , in general problems , as discussed in @xcite , different bifurcation diagrams may suggest contradictory stability results ) .",
    "however , the maxwell construction of equal areas @xcite can be applied to the @xmath140 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) to identify metastable solutions beyond the unstable branch .",
    "these stability considerations may appear rather technical , but they are in fact very natural : under reflection , the @xmath146 diagram maps to the diagram of isotherms of a classical van - der - waals gas , for which the middle branch is well known to be unstable @xcite . under this analogy , @xmath139 corresponds to the gibbs free energy of the gas .",
    "this analysis can not immediately be extended to the more exotic topologies that arise for @xmath86 close to @xmath126 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we note however that part of these branches must be unstable , too : as above , a single solution exists for small @xmath62 , and so the corresponding branch must be stable .",
    "the first fold must be traversed upwards , and the first branch with @xmath136 is thus unstable , as above .",
    "an analogous analysis can be carried out for deformations that vary @xmath86 while keeping @xmath128 fixed : for @xmath147 , the @xmath148 diagram is monotonic , but this ceases to be the case for @xmath149 .",
    "as above , the stability can be inferred from the @xmath150 diagram , and the middle branch with @xmath151 is unstable , too .",
    "the picture that emerges from this discussion is the following : solutions in a region of parameter space underneath the critical point bounded by the spinodal curve are unstable ; a band of solutions on either side of this region and below the critical point are metastable ( fig .  [ fig6]c ) , both to perturbations varying @xmath128 and to perturbations varying @xmath86 .",
    "if invagination , driven by a localized region of active bending , is to be stable , it must move around the critical point : if it were to enter the unstable region , the shell would flip back and forth between the ` shallow ' and ` deep ' invagination states on either side of the unstable region and suffer large strains in the process .",
    "( this makes this kind of instability different from the classical buckling instability of a rod or a ` popper ' toy @xcite : the latter is directed in that , once the instability threshold is crossed , the system will snap to the new preferred configuration and remain there . ) the need for a sequence of stable deformations to move around the critical point rationalises the timecourse of invagination in _ volvox _ : initially , a narrow band of cells undergoes cell shape changes , thereby acquiring a high intrinsic curvature .",
    "this region of cells then widens , moving around the critical point , whereupon the preferred curvature relaxes and posterior inversion can complete .      for different values of @xmath126 ,",
    "the critical point traces out a trajectory in parameter space , characterised by @xmath137 and @xmath134 ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) . as @xmath126 increases , @xmath137 increases , while @xmath134 decreases .",
    "thus the closer to the equator , the more difficult invagination is , not only because there is less room to fit the posterior into the anterior , but also because a stable invagination requires narrower and narrower invaginations of higher and higher intrinsic curvature .",
    "is varied , for different values of @xmath152 .",
    "thin dotted lines are curves of constant @xmath126 . at constant @xmath126 , increased contraction leads to decreased @xmath137 and increased @xmath134 . ]",
    "we are left to explore how contraction affects the position of the critical point , and hence the invagination .",
    "we introduce a reduced posterior radius @xmath153 as in  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) , and modify the intrinsic curvatures and stretches accordingly ( fig .  [ fig4]b , c , d ) .",
    "numerically , we observe that , at constant @xmath126 , increasing contraction ( that is , reducing @xmath152 ) decreases the critical curvature @xmath137 , and increases @xmath134 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "hence contraction aids invagination not only geometrially , but also mechanically : first , it allows invagination close to the equator ( which would otherwise be prevented by different parts of the shell touching ) , and second , it makes stable invagination easier , by reducing @xmath137 .",
    "thus , again , contraction appears as a mechanical means to overcome global geometric constraints .      in the asymptotic analysis in the previous section , we restricted ourselves to small deviations of the normal angle from the spherical configuration so that the problem remained analytically tractable .",
    "while the leading scaling balances remain the same for large rotations , the resulting non - linear `` deep - shell equations '' can not be rescaled so that the dependance on @xmath154 drops out @xcite .",
    "some further insight can , however , be gained in the shallow - shell limit @xmath155 : in terms of the inner coordinate @xmath82 , we write @xmath156 in the absence of forcing by intrinsic curvature or stretches , the leading - order balance is @xmath157 where dashes denote , as before , differentiation with respect to @xmath82 .",
    "this balance arises also in the study of a spherical shell pushed by a plane @xcite : at large indentations , the shell dimples and the plane remains in contact with it only in a circular transition region joining up the undeformed shell to the isometric dimple . with the matching conditions @xmath158 as @xmath159 , ( [ eq : shallow ] ) describe the leading - order shape of this transition region @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this deformation is independent of the contact force , which only arises at the next order in the expansion @xcite .    ) . of the modes shown",
    ", the middle one has the lowest elastic energy . ]",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions for the invagination case are @xmath160 as @xmath159 , and non - constant solutions of ( [ eq : shallow ] ) can indeed be found numerically ( some solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . in these modes ,",
    "the deformations are , in a sense , large compared to intrinsic curvature imposed , making them geometrically ` preferred ' .",
    "their existence lies at the heart of the bifurcation behaviour discussed above .",
    "in this paper , we have explored perhaps the simplest intrinsic deformations of a spherical shell : elastic and geometric effects conspire to constrain deformations resulting from a localized region of intrinsic bending .",
    "contraction , a somewhat more global deformation , alleviates these constraints and thereby facilitates the stable transition from one configuration of the shell to another .",
    "this rich mechanical behaviour makes a mathematically interesting problem in its own right , yet this analysis has implications for _ volvox _ inversion and wider material design problems .",
    "experimental studies of _ volvox _ inversion @xcite had revealed the existence of posterior contraction , and indeed , the simple elastic model that underlies this paper can only reproduce _ in vivo _ shapes once posterior contraction is included @xcite .",
    "of course , contraction is an obvious means of creating a disparity in the anterior and posterior radii required ultimately to fit one hemisphere into the other , but the present analysis reveals that , beyond this geometric effect , there is another , more mechanical side to the coin : if contraction is present , lower intrinsic curvatures , i.e. less drastic cell shape changes , are required to stably invert the posterior hemisphere .",
    "this ascribes a previously unrecognized additional role to these secondary cell shape changes ( i.e. those occurring away from the main bend region ) : just as the shape of the deformed shell arises from a glocal competition between elastic and geometric effects , a combination of local and more global intrinsic properties allow inversion to proceed stably . thus , as we have pointed out previously , this mechanical analysis rationalises the timecouse of the observed cell shape changes , thereby lending further support to the observation of hhn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , that it is a spatio - temporally well regulated sequences of cell shape changes that drives inversion .",
    "thus , the remarkable process of _ volvox _ inversion is mechanically more subtle than it may initially appear to be .",
    "intrinsic deformations that allow transitions of an elastic object from one configuration to another are of inherent interest in the material design context , and divide into two classes : first , snapping transitions for fast transitions between states , studied in @xcite , and second , stable sequences of intrinsic deformations .",
    "the glocal behaviour of the latter is illustrated by the present analysis : in particular , additional transformations such as contraction can increase the number of stable parameter paths between configurations of the elastic object . in this material design context ,",
    "non - axisymmetric deformations such as polygonal folds or wrinkles @xcite could also become important , and may warrant a more detailed analysis .",

    "this work was supported in part by an epsrc studentship ( pah ) , an epsrc established career fellowship ( reg ) , and a wellcome trust senior investigator award ( reg ) .",
    "in this appendix , we sketch the derivation of the euler  lagrange equations of the energy functional ( [ eq : enf ] ) , following @xcite .",
    "the variation takes the form @xmath161 where we have introduced the stresses and moments        the deformed shape of the shell is characterised by the radial and vertical coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath165 , as well as the angle @xmath166 that the normal to the deformed shell makes with the vertical direction .",
    "these geometric quantities obey the equations @xcite @xmath167 we note that one of these is redundant .",
    "the variations @xmath168 are purely geometrical , and one shows that @xcite              these equations , together with two of the geometric relations ( [ eq : geom ] ) , describe the shape of the deformed shell . for numerical purposes ,",
    "it is convenient to remove the singularity at @xmath172 by introducing the transverse shear tension @xcite , @xmath173 , expressed here relative to the undeformed configuration . force balance arguments @xcite show that @xmath174 obeys @xmath175 the solution @xmath173 is selected by the boundary condition @xmath176 . at the poles of the shell , the equations have singular terms in them , but these singularities are either removable or the appropriate boundary values are set by symmetry arguments @xcite .",
