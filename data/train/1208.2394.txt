    "in wireless communications , fading is a major factor that deteriorates the quality of signal transmission .",
    "many methods have been proposed to mitigate the effect of fading .",
    "of particular interest are the multi - antenna technologies which can provide high diversity gain and spatial multiplexing gain @xcite .",
    "recently , a wealth of research has investigated the interplay between forward error correction ( fec ) and spatial diversity . as a type of superior fec code",
    ", low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes are known to perform near the shannon limit over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel @xcite . however , ldpc codes that perform well in awgn channels may not do so in a fading environment @xcite . to overcome this weakness ,",
    "ldpc codes have been studied in fading environments and capacity - approaching ldpc codes have also been designed for single - input multiple - output ( simo ) channels and multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels using density evolution @xcite and extrinsic information transfer ( exit ) function @xcite , respectively .",
    "many of the capacity - approaching ldpc codes , however , are irregular and hence suffer from two main drawbacks  high error floor and nonlinear encoding .",
    "recently , some research has successfully reduced the error floor of short - block - length ldpc codes which can then attain outstanding performance down to an error rate of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the quasi - cyclic ldpc codes that permit linear encoding have been proposed for mimo channels @xcite .",
    "in addition , a novel class of ldpc code , namely multi - edge type ( met ) ldpc code , has been introduced @xcite .",
    "as one subclass of the met - ldpc code , the protograph - based ldpc code has emerged as a promising fec scheme due to its excellent error performance and low complexity @xcite .",
    "two types of protograph codes , namely accumulate - repeat - accumulate ( ara ) code and accumulate - repeat - by-4-jagged - accumulate ( ar4ja ) code , which can realize linear encoding and decoding have been proposed by jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a protograph exit ( pexit ) algorithm has been introduced to predict the threshold of protograph codes over the awgn channel . while the protograph codes have further been studied under rayleigh fading channels @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , little",
    "is known about the analytical performance for protograph codes under fading conditions and antenna diversity has never been considered .    in this paper , we aim to investigate the performance of the protograph codes over a simo rayleigh fading channel . to do so",
    ", we propose a modified pexit algorithm for analyzing the protograph ldpc code over a fading environment .",
    "we then analyze the decoding thresholds of the accumulate - repeat - by-3-accumulate ( ar3a ) code , the ar4ja code , the regular @xmath0 ldpc code and two optimized irregular ldpc codes @xcite and use the thresholds to predict the error performance of the codes .",
    "the results show that the irregular ldpc codes outperform the other codes in the low signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) region .",
    "however , in the high - snr region , the ar3a code possesses the best error performance .",
    "besides , we also study the performance of the ar3a code and the ar4ja code with different diversity orders based on ( i ) the mean and variance of the log - likelihood - ratio ( llr ) values , ( ii ) the pexit analysis , and ( iii ) the bit - error - rate ( ber ) simulations .",
    "we find that the additional gain becomes smaller as we increment the diversity order and hence increase the system complexity .",
    "we organize the remainder of this paper as follows . in section",
    "[ sect : review ] , we present the system model over the simo fading channels and in section  [ sect : pexit ] , we describe our modified pexit algorithm for analyzing protograph codes in the fading environments . in section",
    "[ sect : analysis ] , we analyze the decoding threshold and the initial llr distribution of two conventional protograph codes .",
    "we show the simulation results in section  [ sect : sim_dis ] and finally we give the concluding remarks in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",

    "the information bits ( info bits ) are firstly encoded by the ( punctured ) protograph ldpc code .",
    "then the binary coded bits @xmath2 are passed to a binary - phase - shift - keying ( bpsk ) modulator , the output of which is given by @xmath3 .",
    "the modulated signal @xmath4 is further sent through a simo fading channel with one transmit antenna and @xmath5 receive antennas .",

    "we do not consider interleaving in our system .",
    "moreover , we assume that ( i ) the channels formed by different transmit - receive antenna pairs are independent and ( ii ) each receive antenna possesses perfect channel state information ( csi ) which is changing sufficiently rapidly to satisfy ergodicity @xcite .",
    "the capacity of an ergodic simo channel is further given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average energy per transmitted symbol and @xmath21 is the determinant operator .",
    "this capacity can be evaluated by using monte carlo simulation , i.e. , by generating a large number of independent channel realizations and computing their average capacity value . in practical applications",

    "we also observe that for a fixed ber , the required @xmath133 decreases as the diversity order increases .",
    "however , the rate of decrease is reduced with the diversity order .",
    "for example , we consider the ar4ja code at a ber of @xmath167 . the required @xmath133 decreases from @xmath173  db to @xmath174  db , @xmath175  db and @xmath176  db , respectively , as @xmath5 from @xmath66 to @xmath177 and @xmath156 .",
    "similar observations are found for the ar3a code .",
    "furthermore , these observations agree well with the analytical results found in section  [ sect : analysis ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the system complexity increases with the diversity order .",
    "accordingly , one should appropriately select the number of the receive antennas for a practical system so as to make a good balance between system performance and implementation complexity .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the performance of protograph - based ldpc codes for simo systems under fading channel conditions .",
    "we have proposed a modified pexit algorithm for analyzing such systems equipped an mrc combiner .",
    "we have also used the proposed algorithm to evaluate the decoding threshold of the protograph codes and hence to analyze their error performance .",
    "furthermore , we have compared the decoding thresholds and the distribution of the initial llr values of the protograph codes among different diversity orders .",
    "we conclude that while the error performance of the protograph codes improves with the diversity order , the rate of improvement is reduced as the diversity order becomes larger .",
    "thus , we have to strike a balance between code performance and system complexity when determining the diversity order to be implemented .",
    "our simulation results have also shown that the ar3a code is able to provide a significant gain over the ar4ja code , the regular ( 3 , 6 ) code , and the optimized irregular ldpc codes in the high - snr region . in the future , we will strive to optimize the protograph codes in such systems .",
