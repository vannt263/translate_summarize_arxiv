    "the idea of identifying the higgs field with the internal components of a gauge field in tev ",
    "sized extra dimensions ( gauge - higgs unification ( ghu ) ) has been realized to offer a possible solution to the sm instability of the electroweak scale .",
    "however ghu models compactified on a flat @xmath1 orbifold usually present some common drawbacks : too small higgs and top masses and a too low compactification scale @xcite .    to solve these problems we propose to break the lorentz symmetry in the bulk along the fifth direction @xcite .",
    "context , it can be generated by an axion  like field with twisted boundary conditions , as shown in @xcite .",
    "] in this way , yukawa couplings are no longer constrained by the @xmath2 lorentz invariance and one can obtain order one couplings which are needed to get a realistic top mass .",
    "this leads also to an enhancement of the higgs quartic coupling which pushes the higgs mass above the current experimental bounds ( @xmath3 gev ) .",
    "moreover , the introduction of a @xmath0 `` mirror '' symmetry , which doubles a subset of the bulk degrees of freedom , allows for a partial cancellation of the mass term in the effective higgs potential , thus generating a substantial gap between the electroweak and compactification scales .",
    "we consider a 5d gauge theory compactified on @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge group is taken to be @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with the requirement of having a lagrangian invariant under the @xmath0 `` mirror '' symmetry @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0 orbifold projection is embedded non - trivially in the @xmath8 group , by means of the diagonal matrix @xmath9 ; this choice of parities leads to the breaking @xmath10 . for the abelian @xmath11 and non - abelian @xmath12 fields , we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the unbroken gauge group at @xmath17 is @xmath18 , whereas at @xmath19 we have @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0 mirror symmetry also survives the compactification and remains as an exact symmetry .",
    "the boundary conditions can be diagonalized by a redefinition of the bulk fields @xmath24 ; these combination are respectively periodic and antiperiodic on @xmath25 and have a multiplicative charge @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 under the mirror symmetry .",
    "the 4d zero - modes are the gauge fields in the adjoint of @xmath30 , the @xmath31 and gluon gauge bosons @xmath27 and a charged scalar doublet identified with the higgs field , which arises from the even internal components of the @xmath8 5d gauge fields ( namely @xmath32 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauge groups are identified respectively with the sm @xmath35 and @xmath36 ones , while the hypercharge @xmath37 is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath38 and @xmath31 . the extra @xmath39 gauge symmetry which survives",
    "the orbifold projection is anomalous ( see @xcite ) and its corresponding gauge boson decouples from the low - energy effective theory .",
    "this mechanism is required in order to obtain the correct value of the weak mixing angle .",
    "the most general gauge lagrangian compatible with the mirror symmetry and the 4d lorentz symmetry is @xmath40 -\\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm tr}\\ , f_{\\mu\\nu } f^{\\mu\\nu } - \\rho_w^2 { \\rm tr}\\ , f_{\\mu 5 } f^{\\mu 5},\\ ] ] where we omitted for simplicity the gluon fields , the ghost lagrangian and the gauge - fixing terms .",
    "an additional spontaneous symmetry breaking to @xmath41 is induced by an higgs vev @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the 5d charge of the @xmath8 group and @xmath44 its generators .",
    "the higgs vev is associated to a wilson line @xmath45 , thus the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is equivalent to a wilson line symmetry breaking @xcite .    in the bulk",
    "we introduce couples of fermions @xmath46 , with identical quantum numbers and opposite orbifold parities .",
    "there are couples @xmath47 which are charged under @xmath22 and neutral under @xmath23 and , by mirror symmetry , an equal number of couples @xmath48 charged under @xmath23 and neutral under @xmath22 .",
    "for each quark family we include one pair of couples @xmath49 in the @xmath50 representation of @xmath8 and one pair of couples @xmath51 in the @xmath52 representation of @xmath8 .",
    "both pairs have @xmath53 charge @xmath54 and are in the @xmath55 representation of @xmath56 .",
    "these fields satisfy twisted boundary condition similar to the gauge field ones , in particular the combinations @xmath57 are respectively periodic and antiperiodic on @xmath25 .",
    "the bulk fermion lagrangian for a quark family has the form @xmath58\\psi_i^a + \\overline{\\widetilde\\psi}_i^a \\left[i \\dslash_4 - \\widetilde{k}_a d_5 \\gamma^5\\right ] \\widetilde\\psi_i^a - m_a \\left(\\overline{\\widetilde\\psi}_i^a \\psi_i^a + { \\overline\\psi}_i^a \\widetilde\\psi_i^a\\right)\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    we also introduce massless fermions localized at the @xmath17 fixed point with mirror charge @xmath26 .",
    "these fields can couple only with periodic even bulk fields through localized mass terms ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the couplings ) .",
    "in particular we put an @xmath36 doublet @xmath59 and two singlets @xmath60 and @xmath61 , all in the fundamental representation of @xmath33 and with @xmath31 charge @xmath54 .",
    "the 5d gauge symmetry , which remains unbroken , forbids the appearance of any local higgs potential in the bulk , moreover a localized higgs potential is also forbidden .",
    "the higgs potential is radiatively generated and induced by non - local operators , thus it is finite .",
    "the contributions of the various fermionic and gauge fields to the effective potential are fully reported in @xcite .",
    "the whole effective potential is dominated by the contributions of the top and bottom quark , which provide a negative contribution for the higgs mass squared needed to generate a spontaneous ewsb .",
    "the presence of an unbroken mirror symmetry forces bulk fermions to come in pairs of periodic and antiperiodic fields with the same quantum numbers and the same lorentz - breaking couplings .",
    "this allows for a natural cancellation of the radiatively induced higgs mass , lowering the position of the minimum of the effective potential and reducing the amount of fine - tuning needed to satisfy the experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "after ewsb the w boson zero - mode acquires a mass @xmath62 .",
    "the whole spectrum of the fermion system is described in @xcite .",
    "in particular the top mass , in the limit of large bulk - boundary mixing and small @xmath63 , is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 . from this relation",
    "we deduce that @xmath66 is needed to get the correct top mass .",
    "the bulk - boundary fermion system provides also the lightest non - sm states .",
    "these states are coloured fermions with a mass of order @xmath67 tev , and in particular they are given by an @xmath34 triplet ( with @xmath68 ) , a doublet ( with @xmath69 ) and a singlet ( with @xmath70 ) .",
    "flavour and cp conserving new physics effects can be parameterized by the universal parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and by 3 parameters which describe the distortions of the @xmath78 boson couplings with the quarks @xcite .",
    "the light quarks are nearly exactly localized , thus their couplings with the @xmath78 are undistorted .",
    "the third quark family has a stronger mixing with the bulk fields .",
    "available experimental data put tight bounds on the @xmath79 vertex , which , in our model , gets corrections due to two effects .",
    "one effect is the mixing of @xmath80 with the kk tower of an @xmath81 triplet and an @xmath81 singlet bulk fermions .",
    "however this distortion is much suppressed due to the choice of the bulk fermion quantum numbers and vanishes in the limit of zero @xmath82 mass @xcite .",
    "the other distortion comes from the couplings of the @xmath80 field with the kk tower of the anomalous @xmath39 gauge subgroup .",
    "the correction turns out to be @xmath83 , and can be neglected for @xmath84",
    ".    out of the 7 universal parameters , only @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath77 and @xmath76 arise at leading order in @xmath63 : @xmath85 the others are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath63 and can be neglected in the fits .    in fig .",
    "[ figewptfit ] , we report the constraints on the higgs mass and the compactification scale obtained by a @xmath86 fit using the values in eq .",
    "( [ equnivpar ] ) . from the fit",
    ", one can extract a lower bound on the compactification scale @xmath87 tev ( which corresponds to @xmath88 ) and an upper bound on the higgs mass which varies from @xmath89 gev at @xmath90 tev to @xmath91 gev for @xmath92 tev .",
    "fit on the electroweak precision tests .",
    "the shaded band shows the experimentally excluded values for the higgs mass ( @xmath93 gev ) .",
    "the dots represent the predictions of our model for different values of the microscopic parameters . ]",
    "notice that the values for @xmath71 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 found in our model are essentially those expected in a generic @xmath2 theory with gauge bosons and higgs in the bulk @xcite . on the contrary , the @xmath72 parameter is much bigger and is essentially due to the anomalous gauge field @xmath94 , which generates a distortion of the sm @xmath95 parameter .",
    "the high value of the @xmath72 parameter compensates the effects of a heavy higgs .    performing a random scan of the microscopic parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ figewptfit ] ) , we found that the bound on the compactification scale can be easily fullfilled if a certain amount of fine - tuning is allowed .",
    "we estimated the fine - tuning to be of order a few % @xcite .",
