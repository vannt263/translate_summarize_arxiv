    "onoda _ et al._@xcite have questioned whether anderson transitions in topologically non - trivial systems share the same critical properties as those in topologically trivial systems .",
    "et al._,@xcite studied the metal - ordinary insulator transition in quantum spin hall ( qsh ) systems and found that the value of the critical exponent is the same as that of topologically trivial symplectic systems .",
    "however , obuse _",
    "et al . _ only studied transitions to insulating phases without edge states leaving open the possibility that the critical exponent for the metal - qsh insulator transition might be different .",
    "indeed , the critical conductance distributions have been found to be sensitive to the number of the edge states.@xcite    here , we report an estimation of the critical exponent for the divergence of the localization length at the metal - qsh insulator transition .",
    "we find a value of the critical exponent that is consistent with that in the conventional symplectic class .",
    "our result supports the conjecture that the metal - qsh insulator transition belongs to the conventional wigner - dyson symplectic class .      in order to estimate the critical exponents for the divergence of the localization length",
    ", we have performed a finite size scaling analysis of numerical data for lyapunov exponents.@xcite this involves the estimation of the lyapunov exponents for quasi - one - dimensional systems with effectively infinite length and given cross sections . for extrapolation to the two dimensional limit that is of interest here , a strip with a cross section @xmath1 is considered . for ordinary metal - insulator transitions , the standard approach is to analyze the scaling of the dimensionless quantity @xmath2 which is equal to the product of the smallest positive lyapunov exponent @xmath3 ( precisely defined below ) and the cross section .",
    "( this quantity is the inverse of the so - called mackinnon - kramer parameter . ) in a metallic phase @xmath4 usually increase with @xmath1 and in a localized phase usually decreases with @xmath1 . at the transition point between these phases",
    "@xmath4 becomes independent of @xmath1 and a common crossing point of curves with different @xmath1 is visible on the appropriate graph .",
    "however , when applying this method to the metal - qsh insulator transition we run into a problem : @xmath4 increases in both the metallic and qsh insulating phases and no common crossing point is seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : le1st ] ) .",
    "this problem , which makes a very precise scaling analysis difficult , occurs because of the existence of edge states in the qsh insulating phase .",
    "we have overcome this problem by analyzing the scaling of the quantity @xmath5 which involves the second smallest positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "this lyapunov exponent is much less affected by these edge states and a common crossing point is recovered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : le2nd ] ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated@xcite for the anderson transition in three dimensional systems in the orthogonal symmetry class that the critical exponent obtained from the scaling of higher lyapunov exponents is the same as that obtained from the scaling of the smallest positive exponent .",
    "to describe the qsh system , we use a @xmath6 quantum network model.@xcite the @xmath7 network model has two controlling parameters , @xmath8 , the tunneling probability ( related to the chemical potential ) , and @xmath9 , the spin - mixing probability ( related to the spin - orbit interaction strength ) . for finite @xmath9 ,",
    "the @xmath6 network model exhibits a metallic phase sandwiched between two insulating phases . when periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are imposed , both insulating phases correspond to the ordinary insulating phase [ fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag](a ) ] . on the other hand , when reflecting boundary conditions ( rbc ) are imposed , the insulating phase located for larger @xmath8 exhibits edge states and becomes the qsh insulating phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag](b ) ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath10 network model with rbc shows two types of transition : the metal - ordinary insulator transition and the metal - qsh insulator transition .. in this limit , the transition point belongs to the same universality class as the integer quantum hall system . ]",
    "the cross section of the network is measured in terms of the number of links ; a slice of width @xmath1 contains @xmath1 links , and each link has a spin degree of freedom . in this paper",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath1 even with rbc .",
    "( for @xmath1 odd , perfectly conducting channels appear.@xcite )    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have reported an estimate the critical exponent for the divergence of the localization length at the metal - quantum spin hall insulator transition . by analyzing the scaling of the 2nd smallest positive lyapunov exponent",
    ", we have estimated the critical exponent to be @xmath11 .",
    "our result shows that this critical exponent is insensitive to the topological property of the insulating phase .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the critical conductance distribution,@xcite which is sensitive to the type of transition , _",
    "i.e. _ , the presence or absence of edge states in the adjacent insulating phase .    analysis of the scaling of higher lyapunov exponents may also be useful in the study of other anderson transitions where conducting edge or surface states occur in the insulating phase , such as , for example , in topological insulators .",
