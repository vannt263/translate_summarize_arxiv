    "quantum theory of gravity is one of the most sought - after goals in physics . despite continuous efforts to tackle this important problem , resulting in interesting proposals such as superstring theory and loop quantum gravity",
    ", there is still no clear sign of the theory of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , when the back - action of matter on gravitation field is neglected , one can write down a theory of quantum fields in background curved spacetime by extending quantum field theory in minkowski metric to a general metric @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to treating external fields as c - numbers and predicts interesting new phenomena that are valid in appropriate regimes .",
    "similarly to the prediction of pair creation in external electric fields @xcite , external gravitational fields  as described by background spacetime ",
    "induce particle creation @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "particle creation is caused by the change in the vacuum state itself under quite generic conditions .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a classical optical simulation of particle creation in binary waveguide arrays .",
    "there have been many proposals and experimental demonstrations of plethora of interesting physics in coupled waveguide arrays @xcite . in particular ,",
    "optical simulation of the 1 + 1 dimensional dirac equation in binary waveguides has been proposed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "we show that the setup can be generalised to also simulate the dirac equation in 2 dimensional curved spacetime .",
    "particle creation is by definition a many - body phenomenon and the full simulation of the result requires quantum fields as a main ingredient ( for example , see @xcite for a simulation of dirac equation in curved spacetime with cold atoms on optical lattices ) .",
    "however , light propagation in a waveguide array is an intrinsically classical phenomena , so how can we simulate particle creation in a binary waveguide array ?",
    "the short answer is that we will be looking at the single - particle analog of particle creation .",
    "as we will see , the fundamental reason behind particle creation is the difference in the vacuum state , which in turn is captured by different mode - expansions of quantum fields .",
    "we can thus concentrate on a single - mode at a time and simulate the effect .",
    "in fact , the well - known klein paradox already shows that many - body effects are already manifest in the single - particle dirac equation , and the phenomenon of pair production in strong electric fields has been studied within the single particle picture @xcite .",
    "we study the time evolution of spinor wave packets and demonstrate that an analog of particle creation can be _ visualised _ in the light evolution in a binary waveguide array . here",
    ", we stress that by using the phenomenon of ` zitterbewegung ' ( the jittering motion of a dirac particle ) , one can bypass the quantitative checks in ` proving ' the simulation of particle creation .",

    "ii , we provide a pedagogical introduction to the dirac equation in curved spacetime , assuming familiarity with the conventional dirac equation . in section iii ,",
    "we specialise to the 1 + 1 dimension and provide a few examples of spacetime metric .",
    "particle creation in curved spacetime is explained , using scalar fields for simplicity , and the single - particle analogs for the dirac spinors is discussed .",
    "section iv shows the wave packet evolution both in flat and curved spacetimes , using time - dependent gravitational fields as an example",
    ". a single - particle analog of particle creation in a particular case is explicitly demonstrated .",

    "our aim is to provide as pedagogical and self - contained account as possible .",
    "we have tried to collect and present essential ideas to understand quantum fields in curved spacetime and how it predicts particle creation .",
    "it is our hope that the reader will find this helpful in understanding the essential ideas quickly and develop further interesting analogies .",
    "let us start with the derivation of the dirac equation in curved spacetime .",
    "this requires the concept of spin - connection , which will be discussed at a pedagogical level .",
    "we closely follow ref .",
    "@xcite .      special theory of relativity has taught us that time and space are observer - dependent concepts in that observers moving relative to each other have different notions of time and space intervals .",
    "this comes about because the laws of physics are covariant under lorentz transformation , meaning that all observers agree on the form of the physical laws in their own coordinate frames .",
    "general theory of relativity takes this one step further and states that the laws should be covariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "equations of motion are written in terms of tensors  quantities that are independent of local coordinate systems used to describe them . to write the equations of motion one",
    "also needs the concept of covariant derivatives , which basically is the correct way of differentiating tensors to yield another tensor ( of higher rank ) . to understand this ,",
    "consider a vector in minkowski spacetime @xmath0 , which transforms under the lorentz transformation as @xmath1 .",
    "we use the einstein convention where the repeated indices are summed over .",
    "now let s see how the partial derivative of a vector transforms in flat spacetime : @xmath2 in tensorial language , one says that @xmath3 transforms as a tensor of rank ( 1,1 ) , where @xmath4 denote @xmath5 indices on the top and @xmath6 indices on the bottom . in curved spacetime , this is no longer true because @xmath7 is generically a spacetime dependent quantity .",
    "the partial differential operator must therefore be generalised ( to a covariant derivative ) , so that the ` differentiated ' object is also a tensor .",
    "this requires the concept of parallel transport .",
    "mathematically , one has to be careful when taking a derivative of a vector because the definition of a vector along a curve defined by @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are spacetime points at @xmath12 and @xmath8 respectively , require comparison between two vectors in different manifolds .",
    "this is okay in flat spaces , but in curved spaces there is no intrinsic way to do it .",
    "what we need is a concept of parallel transport that moves a vector  or more generally a tensor  along a curve while keeping it ` constant ' .",
    "@xmath13 can be parallel transported to @xmath10 with the help of the ` affine connection ' @xmath14 such that @xmath15 the corresponding covariant derivative is written as @xmath16 with which we can define the parallel transport condition as @xmath17 note that this is a generalisation of the condition in flat space @xmath18 .",
    "covariant derivative of a one - form , i.e. , a ( 0,1 ) tensor @xmath19 is found to be @xmath20    the transformation properties of a connection can be found by demanding that @xmath21 transforms as a tensor , i.e. , @xmath22 this yields @xmath23 showing that @xmath14 is not a tensor .",
    "the above consideration shows that the concept of parallel transport requires an affine connection to be defined .",
    "this is a very general property irrespective of the detailed structure of the manifold , allowing many distinct definitions of parallel transport . in general relativity , however , it is possible define a unique connection compatible with the metric @xmath24 ( remember , @xmath25 ) as follows .",
    "first , the connection is assumed to be torsion - free , meaning that @xmath26 .",
    "second , the metric is assumed to obey the parallel transport condition : @xmath27 . the latter guarantees that the scalar product of two parallel - transported vectors is constant .",
    "that is , if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 .    from the second assumption",
    ", we have the following three relations @xmath30 subtracting the second and third lines from the first and using the first assumption , we obtain @xmath31 which after some rearranging yields @xmath32 this is the metric connection called the christoffel symbol .      so far , we have seen how to take covariant derivatives of tensors .",
    "however , this is not enough to write down the dirac equation in curved spacetime .",
    "we also need to know how to take covariant derivatives of spinors . for this purpose",
    ", we will use the fact that locally it is always possible ( due to the equivalence principle ) to find inertial coordinate system in which the metric becomes minkowskian . suppose that @xmath33 are such local coordinates at point @xmath34 ( we use the convention that latin indices @xmath35 are used to label local inertial coordinates and greek indices @xmath36 for general coordinates ) . then defining @xmath37 at each point in spacetime",
