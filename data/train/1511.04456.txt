    "development of cavity optomechanical devices from single - crystal diamond has been limited due to challenges associated with fabricating mechanically isolated structures from bulk diamond chips . while initial development of diamond optomechanical devices used nanocrystalline diamond @xcite , single crystal diamond material promises lower mechanical dissipation @xcite and the ability to host highly coherent nv centers @xcite . here",

    "the accompanying stress fields are strong enough to drive diamond color center spin transitions with a single phonon - spin coupling rate that is predicted to exceed that of previously studied mhz frequency nanomechanical structures @xcite , despite having orders of magnitude higher @xmath8 and smaller phonon amplitude , owing to the localized nature of the microdisk mechanical resonances .",
    "in addition , the ability of the microdisks to support optical modes at visible wavelengths is compatible with resonant coupling to nv center optical transitions @xcite , as well as operation in fluid environments of interest for sensing applications @xcite .",

    "undercut would allow the study of larger diameter microdisks ( 6 @xmath34 to 8 @xmath34 ) present on the chip , which would in turn possess a smaller thickness than the structures studied here .",
    "the devices were characterized by monitoring the transmission of a dimpled optical fiber taper @xcite evanescently coupled to the microdisk and input with light from tunable diode lasers ( new focus velocity ) with wavelengths near 1530 nm or 637 nm .",
    "for the 1530 nm measurements , the output of the fiber taper was monitored by both low- and high - bandwidth photoreceivers ( newport 1621 and 1554-b , respectively ) , and a calibrated optical power meter ( newport 2936-r ) .",
