    "brown dwarfs are substellar mass objects with effective temperatures ( t@xmath6 ) ranging from stellar - like at the high end ( @xmath7 3000 k ) to planet - like at the low - end .",
    "many brown dwarfs are found in isolation ( making direct observations and spectra obtainable ) , and they can share t@xmath6s , luminosities , ages , and/or masses with directly imaged exoplanets .",
    "therefore they are a gateway population to characterization studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nasa s wide - field infrared explorer ( wise ) mission launched in late 2009 , revolutionized our understanding of the coldest brown dwarfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up of wise selected targets led to the discovery of nearly 20 objects in the t@xmath6@xmath7300 - 500 k temperature range and the definition of a new spectral subtype  the  y \" dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these cold brown dwarfs have distinctly lower luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite ) from warmer  t \" dwarf sources that have been studied for the past 15 years ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "y dwarf temperatures are more similar to those of the cold , gas - giant exoplanets known to orbit solar - aged stars than are warmer brown dwarfs : the temperatures and atmospheres of which have more in common with low - mass stars .",
    "their spectra are characterized by remarkably strong ch4 absorption , resulting in j and h band peaks that are narrower than those for warmer t dwarfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the population of these extremely cold brown dwarfs leads to a measurement of both the ability of star formation processes to make brown dwarfs at the lowest masses , and the mass cut - off for the star formation process itself .",
    "studies of their individual spectral energy distributions reveal the complex chemical processes that dominate low - temperature atmospheres , directly applicable to interpreting exoplanet data .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered the coldest brown dwarf yet detected ( t@xmath6 @xmath7 225 - 260 k ) as the fourth closest system to the sun .",
    "the source , designated wise j085510.83 - 071442.5 ( here - after w0855 ) , is important for studies of cold , gas - giant - planet - like atmospheres .",
    "notably , it allows us to characterize an important opacity source for studies of exoplanets  the clouds  at even lower temperatures than possible in work to date .    in this paper",
    ", we present a deep @xmath0 band image of w0855 .",
    "a comparison of our photometry with recent model atmosphere predictions from @xcite provides evidence for sulfide and water ice clouds .",
    "section 2 details the background data on w0855 .",
    "section 3 describes the data acquired for this paper and section 4 investigates the position of w0855 on color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "we present the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite the high proper motion of the source w0855 was noted between the 2010 may and november wise images .",
    "however at the time of the original detection by wise , it was not realized that the photometry was contaminated by a cluster of background sources which skewed the photometry and astrometry ( @xcite , @xcite ; and see the area surrounding the  wise positions \" on figure  [ t0855_j3 ] ) .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12$]@xmath13 m photometry for w0855 and verified the motion .",
    "the astrometry placed w0855 among the four closest systems to the sun with a parallax of 0.454@xmath140.045  ( or @xmath72.2pc ) and a proper motion of 8.1@xmath140.1yr@xmath15 ( the third largest proper motion ever detected ) .    using the absolute magnitude at 4.5@xmath13 m and the ( j - [ 4.5 ] ) color limit , @xcite compared to model predictions and estimated the t@xmath6 for w0855 to be 225 - 260 k , making this the coldest compact source ever detected outside our own solar system .",
    "@xcite recently reported new , uncontaminated wise photometry with neowise - r that is in far better agreement with the expected  y \" spectral type for this source than the first detections indicated .",
    "@xcite also refined the parallax and proper motion of w0855 using a new epoch , reporting @xmath16=0.448@xmath14 0.033@xmath17 and @xmath13= 8.08@xmath140.05yr@xmath15 .    over a given age range of 1 - 10 gyr ( covering all possible ages for a thin / thick disk milky way object ) , the mass of this  brown dwarf \"",
    "is 3 - 10 m@xmath18 making it a truly remarkable bridge between the lowest mass objects formed by star formation processes and the giant planets we are only beginning to obtain directly imaged information on .",
    "indeed , it easily crosses into the  planetary mass regime \" classically placed at 13 m@xmath18 ( @xcite ; see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath19{cdf.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{pdf.eps }   \\\\",
    "the majority of brown dwarfs are characterized in the near - infrared and all y dwarfs have been classified using near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "as follow - up spectroscopy for w0855 is extremely difficult given its cold temperature and low luminosity , near - infrared photometry is required to place it in context with the known brown dwarf population .",
    "moreover , @xcite predict that water condenses in the upper atmospheres of objects with temperatures @xmath20 450 k , leading to prominent features notable in the @xmath21 band . as w0855 only had a lower limit on the @xmath21 band photometry from @xcite",
    ", there was excellent motivation for obtaining a deep image of w0855 in the near - infrared .",
    "w0855 was observed with the fourstar infrared mosaic camera mounted on the 6.5 m magellan baade telescope at las campanas observatory , chile ( @xcite ) as part of an ongoing parallax program ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the instrument uses four 2048 x 2048 teledyne hawaii-2rg arrays that produce a 10.9@xmath22 x 10.9@xmath22 field of view at a plate scale of 0.159@xmath17 pixel@xmath15 .",
    "w0855 was observed at the start of each night on 2014 may 12- 14 ( ut ) for 2 - 3 hours with the narrowband @xmath0 filter . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 filter encompasses the @xmath21-band opacity hole for y dwarfs . at the same time , its narrow wavelength coverage minimizes signal from the sky , making it an optimal choice for imaging the coldest brown dwarfs .",
    "total integration times collected during the imaging sequence for w0855 varied as did the seeing . as we were observing a target at 08 hours and -07 degrees from chile in may , we only had the start of the evening before the source fell to an unreasonably high airmass .",
    "the first night had the poorest conditions with an average seeing of 0.9 - 1.0@xmath17 .",
    "the second and third nights varied but shared an average seeing of 0.4 - 0.6@xmath17 .",
    "our imaging strategy employed a 20s exposure at @xmath0 with 6 co - adds and an 11-point dither pattern randomly distributed within a 15@xmath17 box .",
    "we collected 50 images on the first night , 61 images on the second , and 40 images on the third .",
    "data reduction was done using the fourstar pipeline ( monson et al . in prep ) .",
    "raw frames were linearized , dark subtracted and flat - fielded for each of the four arrays . then",
    ", a first - pass local background was created for each frame using the adjacent nine in the following manner : ( 1 ) each nearby frame had a low - order background term fit and subtracted to remove gradients , then the resultant images were averaged with 50% of the high values clipped to remove sources .",
    "( 2 ) the backgrounds which were removed were averaged together without clipping but weighted by the differential time from the desired frame .",
    "( 3 ) the two backgrounds ( low - order and high - order ) were added together to construct the first - pass background for each frame .",
    "the background subtracted images were source - extracted with the astromatic.net program @xmath23 , fit with a world coordinate system ( wcs ) grounded with matches to the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) using @xmath24 and then re - sampled using @xmath25 to construct a first - pass mosaic image .",
    "point sources were then detected and individual masks updated for each original input frame .",
    "a second - pass sky subtraction step proceeded like the first except instead of clipping the upper 50% of pixel values , objects were explicitly masked from each frame .",
    "a final mosaic was created from all three nights by weighing each exposure by : @xmath26 where 1e7 is an arbitrary constant , fwhm is the seeing in arcseconds , stdev is the standard deviation from the background counts for each frame , and flxscale is a differential zero point term that takes into account slight airmass or weather related changes in image depth .",
    "the total exposure time accumulated over the three nights was 5.03 hr , however the weighting strategy resulted in a final mosaic at an exposure time of 3.5 hr with a seeing of 0.5@xmath17 .",
    "consequently nearly all of the first night s data did not contribute to the final mosaic due to the poor conditions .    to calibrate the photometry in our image",
    ", we followed the same prescription described in @xcite . within the final image",
    ", we reached a 5@xmath3 aperture limit at @xmath0 of @xmath7 23.8 or j@xmath2 @xmath7 24.0 when the photometric relations from @xcite are applied ( j@xmath2 - j3 = 0.20@xmath140.03 for y dwarfs ) . figure  [ t0855_j3 ] shows an @xmath7 45@xmath17 x 25@xmath17 region of the final mosaic containing the previous wise positions , the @xcite @xmath8 positions , the neowise - r position from @xcite and our expected 2014 14 may position .",
    "we investigated the expected position of w0855 in our images with great care to give a thorough limit on the detection .",
    "for this analysis we focused only on a @xmath7 3.0@xmath22 square portion of the final mosaic centered on w0855 .",
    "we first found all sources in a gaussian smoothed image ( with @xmath3 equal to the fwhm ) with a signal to noise ( s / n ) @xmath4 5@xmath3 .",
    "we then masked those out using a radius set by where a gaussian would fall below 10% of the noise floor .",
    "we then conducted aperture photometry on the unsmoothed , expected position of w0855 as well as 1000 random places in the image ( avoiding the masks ) using a radius of 0.6731 x fwhm ( full width at half maximum )  based on the optimum size for sources whose point response function ( prf ) profiles can be approximated as gaussian ( masci 2008 ) .    the estimated position for w0855 on 14",
    "may 2014 was deduced from the astrometry and neowise - r position in the @xcite paper taken just 10 days prior to the fourstar image .",
    "we estimated a 1 pixel uncertainty by applying the fourstar plate - scale to the @xcite astrometric uncertainties added in quadrature with the wcs uncertainty ( 0.1@xmath17 based on the fit to 2mass positions ) .",
    "aperture photometry was conducted at positions of x@xmath141 pixel , y@xmath141 pixel from the expected position .",
    "this accounts for the astrometric uncertainty and pinpoints the exact location of maximum flux associated with w0855 .",
    "the estimated position of w0855 using the propagated neowise - r position is ( ra=133.7861633 , dec=-7.2442513 , epoch=56792.0 ) whereas the 2.6@xmath3 position appears at ( ra=133.7861696 , dec=-7.2442643 , epoch=56792.0 ) .",
    "therefore our detected fourstar position is @xmath20 0.3 pixel from the expectation or consistent within the astrometric uncertainty .",
    "we note that the difference between the expected and measured position for w0855 is primarily in declination .",
    "the same procedure was used for the randomly chosen background pixels , therefore regardless of the 1 pixel buffer , the detections and consequent aperture comparisons are robust .",
    "the cumulative and probability distribution functions for a detection at the position of w0855 are shown in figure  [ fig : cdf ] .",
    "we find that the w0855 aperture is brighter than @xmath7 98% of the 1000 random apertures or equivalent to a 2.6@xmath3 detection .",
    "the uncertainty for this low - signal source is assymetric and we measure @xmath0=24.8@xmath1  or j@xmath2=25.0@xmath1 when the photometric relations from @xcite are applied .",
    "this value is consistent with the 5@xmath3 j@xmath2 @xmath4 24.0 limit on our photometry and 5@xmath3 detection but we have rounded the upper limit magnitude ] .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams are a tool for investigating atmospheric properties of the brown dwarf population as well as testing model predictions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for warm brown dwarfs ",
    "primarily l dwarfs  iron and silicate grain clouds form thick dust layers and largely shape observable properties ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as objects cool into the t dwarf phase , l dwarf clouds rapidly clear and models predict that less refractory sulfide and salt clouds condense in the photospheres ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . for the coldest brown dwarfs , the y dwarfs at t@xmath6 @xmath20 @xmath7450 k ( see figure  [ t0855_spt ] ) , @xcite predict that water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds . at t@xmath6 @xmath20 350 - 375 k , @xcite",
    "also show that these water clouds become optically thick , scatter light at optical wavelengths through @xmath21 band and absorb in the infrared with prominent features .",
    "as such , infrared color - magnitude diagrams are particularly telling about the condensate species present in the photospheres of cold brown dwarfs .    using our new photometry ( both the 5@xmath3 limit and 2.6@xmath3 detection )",
    ", we look for evidence of water clouds in w0855 . figure  [ cmd_t0855 ] shows the j@xmath2 @xmath5 w2 versus m@xmath27 for late - type t and y dwarfs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . as stated above",
    ", @xcite recently published a set of atmosphere models applicable for the coldest brown dwarfs discovered ( 200 k@xmath20 t@xmath6 @xmath20 450 k ) that include the influence of water clouds in addition to the sulfide clouds described in @xcite ( the model is a hybrid with 50% cloudy and 50% clear ) .",
    "we have over plotted both of these model predictions on figure  [ cmd_t0855 ] .",
    "the sulfide cloud model predictions that include na@xmath28s , mns , zns , cr , and kcl condensate clouds and are applicable for objects in the range ( 400 k@xmath20 t@xmath6 @xmath20 1300 k ) are shown at log g=5.0 for differing sedimentation parameters ( f@xmath29=5 to f@xmath29=2 as first defined in @xcite ) .",
    "the water cloud models are shown at f@xmath29=5 for log @xmath30= 3.0 to log @xmath30=5.0 with the applicable t@xmath6 for the given position labeled on figure  [ cmd_t0855 ] . the clear ( or cloudless ) model predictions from @xcite are also shown for log @xmath30=3.0 to log @xmath30=5.0 , although those show little diversity for differing gravity values . at t@xmath6 @xmath20 350",
    "k the clear model predictions begin to diverge from those that include water clouds , giving a lever for differentiating between the two opacity realms .",
    "we note that all models displayed are in chemical equilibrium for solar metallicity .",
    "when the range of these parameters are fully incorporated into the models ( e.g. non - solar metallicity , non - equilibrium chemistry ) , predictions may vary ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the previous near infrared limit of w0855 of @xmath31 @xmath4 23.0 was not sufficiently deep enough to discriminate between model predictions ( @xcite ) .",
    "our new 5@xmath3 limit shifts the source 1 magnitude fainter and into the blue end of atmosphere model predictions that include water clouds .",
    "the 2.6@xmath3 detection of j@xmath2=25.0@xmath1 places w0855 2.7@xmath3 from the clear model and squarely within sulfide and water cloud predictions for an object at 225 @xmath20 t@xmath6@xmath20 250 k. the uncertainty is inclusive of all gravity predictions , however , given the large tangential velocity ( v@xmath32 = 85@xmath14 9 km@xmath15 ) of this source makes a young age unlikely ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the recently discovered brown dwarf wise j085510.83 - 071442.5 ( w0855 ) is important for cold atmosphere studies and a gateway object for directly imaged gas - giant characterization programs . in this work",
    ", we present a deep near - infrared @xmath0 band image for the source .",

    "w0855 is the reddest brown dwarf yet characterized .    investigating the position of w0855 on the j@xmath2 @xmath5 w2 versus m@xmath27 color - magnitude diagram reveals that this is the first compact source outside our solar system to have evidence for water ice clouds .",

    "<S> we present a deep near - infrared image of the newly discovered brown dwarf wise j085510.83 - 071442.5 ( w0855 ) using the fourstar imager at las campanas observatory . </S>",
    "<S> our detection of @xmath0=24.8@xmath1 ( j@xmath2=25.0@xmath1 ) at 2.6@xmath3  or equivalently an upper limit of @xmath0 @xmath4 23.8 ( j@xmath2 @xmath4 24.0 ) at 5@xmath3 makes w0855 the reddest brown dwarf ever categorized ( j@xmath2 @xmath5 w2 = 10.984@xmath1 at 2.6@xmath3  or equivalently an upper limit of j@xmath2 @xmath5 w2 @xmath4 9.984 at 5@xmath3 ) and refines its position on color magnitude diagrams . comparing the new photometry with chemical equilibrium model atmosphere predictions , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that w0855 is 2.7@xmath3 from models using a cloudless atmosphere and well reproduced by partly cloudy models ( 50% ) containing sulfide and water ice clouds . </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium chemistry or non - solar metallicity may change predictions , however using currently available model approaches , this is the first candidate outside our own solar system to have direct evidence for water clouds . </S>"
