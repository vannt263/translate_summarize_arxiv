    "searches for planets around giant stars offer an effective way to extend studies of planetary system formation and evolution to stellar masses substantially larger than 1 @xmath2 @xcite . unlike their progenitors on the main - sequence ,",
    "the cool atmospheres of evolved stars produce many narrow spectral lines , making a radial velocity ( rv ) measurement precision of @xmath3 10 m s@xmath4 possible .",
    "there are now over 30 known planets and brown dwarf - mass companions detected around giants , providing statistics that are becoming sufficient to constrain the efficiency of planet formation as a function of mass and chemical composition of these evolved stars .",
    "for example , there is an ongoing debate as to whether the correlation between stellar metallicity and planet frequency present in main - sequence stars @xcite is weaker or even entirely absent in giants , possibly due to the dilution of metals as the convection zones deepen during giant evolution @xcite .",
    "a recent study of a homogeneous sample of subgiants by @xcite reveals that such correlation does exist in the case of these stars .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is the observed deficiency of short - period planets around k - giants , with the closest one detected so far having an orbital radius of 0.6 au @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to subgiant systems , which include a few known `` hot jupiters '' @xcite .",
    "models of the dynamics of planetary systems around evolving giants suggest that the effect may be due to the tidal capture and engulfment of planets at the initial orbital radii of 0.3 - 0.6 au @xcite .    as a consequence of the observed correlation of the frequency of occurrence of massive planets with stellar mass @xcite , there has been a growing number of detections of brown dwarf - mass companions to giants @xcite .",
    "these include discoveries of two - companion systems @xcite , in which the orbiting bodies may be brown dwarfs , or supermassive planets created via the core collapse process @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also uncovered several systems where a dwarf or subgiant is orbited both by a jupiter - mass planet and a close brown dwarf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we report another intriguing case of a system consisting of a jupiter - mass planet around the giant bd + 48 738 , and an outer companion , which may be another star , but the currently available constraints do not exclude a possibility that its mass falls in the brown dwarf range",
    ".    the rv variations over a wide range of timescales and amplitudes observed in giant stars can be caused by a variety of phenomena , including orbital dynamics , processes that are intrinsic to the star , such as stellar oscillations or spot activity coupled with stellar rotation , and other effects that may still await identification .",
    "for example , as shown by the corot and kepler photometry of giants , both radial and non - radial oscillations are common in these stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , p - mode oscillations have been identified in high - cadence rv measurements of several of them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that one can make a statistical distinction between the stellar and non - stellar origin of rv variations in giants by correlating them with stellar properties , such as the b - v color and surface gravity .",
    "here , we show two examples of such variability in the k2-giants , hd 240237 and hd 96127 . also , using the empirically established dependencies between the effective temperature , @xmath5 , and the b - v color @xcite , and @xmath5 and surface gravity , log(@xmath6 ) , @xcite , we investigate the intrinsic rv variability in a sample of k - giants with planets in terms of stellar metallicity , [ fe / h ] , and find a suggestive anti - correlation between [ fe / h ] and the observed stellar jitter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "an outline of the observing procedure and a description of the basic properties of the three stars are given in section 2 , followed by the analysis of rv measurements in section 3 .",
    "the accompanying analysis of rotation and stellar activity indicators is given in section 4 .",
    "finally , our results are summarized and further discussed in section 5 .",
    "observations were made with the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; * ? ? ? * ) equipped with the high - resolution spectrograph @xcite , in the queue - scheduled mode @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph was used in the r = 60,000 resolution mode with a gas cell ( i@xmath7 ) inserted into the optical path , and it was fed with a 2  fiber .",
    "details of our survey , the observing procedure , and data analysis have been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of the three stars were determined as part of an extensive study of the ptps targets described in the forthcoming paper by ( * ? ? ? * z11 ) . here , we give a brief description of the methodology employed in that work .",
    "measurements of @xmath5 , log(@xmath6 ) , and [ fe / h ] were based on the spectroscopic method of @xcite , in which the fei and feii lines are analyzed under the lte assumption .",
    "we used equivalent width measurements of 190 non - blended , strong fei and 15 feii lines per star which resulted in the mean uncertainties of 13 k , 0.05 , and 0.07 for @xmath5 , log(@xmath6 ) , and [ fe / h ] , respectively . except for [ fe / h ] ,",
    "these uncertainties represent numerical errors intrinsic to the iterative procedures of @xcite .",
    "the actual uncertainties are likely to be 2 - 3 times larger .",
    "uncertainties of the [ fe / h ] measurements were computed as standard deviations of the mean fei and feii abundances and are thus more realistic .    since the hipparcos parallaxes of our stars are either unavailable or very uncertain , only rough estimates of their masses and radii could be made .",
    "initial estimates of stellar luminosities were derived from the @xmath8 values resulting from the empirical calibrations of @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic color indices , ( b - v)@xmath9 , and bolometric corrections , @xmath10 , were calculated from the empirical calibrations of @xcite .",
    "stellar masses and ages were estimated by comparing positions of the three stars in the [ log(@xmath11 ) , log(@xmath6 ) , log(@xmath5 ) ] space with the theoretical evolutionary tracks of @xcite and @xcite for the closest respective values of metallicity .",
    "stellar mass estimates derived from this modeling process were then used to adopt the final values of luminosity .",
    "stellar radii and the associated uncertainties were then computed using the spectroscopic values of @xmath5 and adopted luminosities .",
    "obviously , uncertainties affecting the position of a star in the parameter space determine the corresponding errors in mass estimates . as the values of t@xmath12 and log(@xmath6 )",
    "are relatively well determined , the largest uncertainties are contributed by stellar luminosity or parallax . as a useful guidance ,",
    "the mean uncertainty in stellar mass estimates for over 300 red clump giants analyzed in z11 using the above approach amounts to about 0.3 m@xmath13 .",
    "the stellar rotation velocities were estimated by means of the @xcite cross - correlation method .",
    "the cross - correlation functions were computed as described by @xcite with the template profiles cleaned of the blended lines . given the estimates of stellar radii , the derived rotation velocity limits were used to approximate the stellar rotation periods .",
    "the parameters of the three stars are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "rvs were measured using the standard i@xmath7 cell calibration technique @xcite .",
    "a template spectrum was constructed from a high - resolution fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) i@xmath7 spectrum and a high signal - to - noise stellar spectrum measured without the i@xmath7 cell .",
    "doppler shifts were derived from least - squares fits of template spectra to stellar spectra with the imprinted i@xmath7 absorption lines .",
    "typical snr for each epoch was @xmath14200 , as measured at the peak of the blaze function at 5936  .",
    "the rv for each epoch was derived as a mean value of 391 independent measurements from the 17 usable echelle orders , each divided into 23 , 4 - 5   blocks , with a typical , intrinsic uncertainty of 6 - 10 m s@xmath4 at 1@xmath15 level over all blocks ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) .",
    "this rv precision levels made it quite sufficient to use the @xcite algorithm to refer the measured rvs to the solar system barycenter .",
    "the rv measurements of each star were modeled in terms of the standard , six - parameter keplerian orbits , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "least - squares fits to the data were performed using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite .",
    "errors in the best - fit orbital parameters were estimated from the parameter covariance matrix .",
    "these parameters are listed in table [ table2 ] for each of the three stars .",
    "the estimated , @xmath147 m s@xmath4 errors in rv measurements were evidently too small to account for the actually measured post - fit rms residuals ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "as outlined in section 1 , giant stars are subject to atmospheric fluctuations and radial and non - radial pulsations that may manifest themselves as an excess rv variability . in particular , the p - mode oscillations , typically occurring on the timescales of hours to days , are usually heavily under - sampled in the rv surveys of giants and can account for a significant fraction of the observed post - fit rv noise @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of such variations can be made using the scaling relation of @xcite , which relates the amplitude of p - mode oscillations to the mass , @xmath16 , and the luminosity , @xmath17 , of the star : @xmath18 where the amplitude , @xmath19 is in cm s@xmath4 .",
    "the statistical significance of each detection was assessed by calculating false alarm probabilities ( fap ) using the rv scrambling method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "faps for hd 240237 and hd 96127 were calculated for the null hypothesis that the planetary signal can be adequately accounted for by noise .",
    "two fap values were calculated for bd + 48 738 , first for the null hypothesis that the long - term trend can be treated as linear , then for the null hypothesis that it can be modeled as a fraction of a long - period , circular orbit and noise .",
    "rvs of hd 240237 ( bd + 57 2714 , hip 114840 ) are listed in table [ table3 ] .",

    "a simultaneous characterization of the two orbits is difficult , as the outer companion s period is much longer than the time baseline of our measurements .",
    "however , the curvature of the observed trend is statistically significant , with a fap value of 0.01% .",
    "this makes it feasible to constrain a range of possible two - orbit models by fitting for parameters of the inner planet over a grid of fixed solutions for the long - period orbit .",

    "continuing observations of the star will help placing tighter constraints on the orbiting bodies in this interesting system .",
    "rvs of hd 96127 ( bd + 45 1892 ) were measured at 50 epochs over a period of 1840 days from january 2004 to february 2009 ( table [ table5 ] ) .",

    "photometry and line bisector analysis , which are efficient stellar activity indicators , have been routinely used to verify the authenticity of planet detections by means of the rv method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , when contemporaneous photometric data are not available , it is important to correlate the time variability of line bisectors and rvs , in order to investigate a possible contribution of stellar activity to the observed rv behavior .",
    "for example , even for slow rotators like k - giants discussed here , a stellar spot only a few percent in size could introduce line profile variations as large as @xmath14100 m s@xmath4 @xcite , which would be easy to detect .",
    "although a correlation between line bisector and rvs does provide evidence that the intrinsic stellar processes contribute part or all of the observed rv variability , many sources of jitter can not be readily identified in a bisector analysis .",
    "this is because the bisector changes may be too small to measure distinctly from the apparent rv shift or they are indistinguishable from temporal changes in the spectrograph line spread function .",
    "consequently , the lack of such a correlation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for demonstrating that measured rv variations are of a planetary origin .",
    "additional information , such as a distinctly keplerian shape of the rv curve @xcite or a strict persistence of the rv periodicity over many cycles @xcite , is necessary to fully verify such detections .    in order to investigate a possible contribution of stellar jitter to the observed rv periodicities ,",
    "we have examined the existing photometry data in search for any periodic light variations , and performed a thorough analysis of time variations in line bisector velocity span ( bvs ) and bisector curvature ( bc ) for each of the three stars discussed in this paper .",

    "are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "in addition , using the scatter seen in the photometry data and the rotational velocities determined as described above , we have estimated the amplitude of rv and bvs variations due to a possible presence of spots on the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "the calculated values range from @xmath3 5 m s@xmath4 to @xmath3 13 m s@xmath4 and from @xmath3 17 m@xmath4 to @xmath3 27 m s@xmath4 , for the rv and the bvs amplitudes , respectively , which is much less than the variability observed in the three stars .",
    "the longest time span photometry available for this star comes from 120 hipparcos measurements @xcite , made between mjd 47884 and 49042 .",
    "these data give a mean magnitude of the star of @xmath32 .",
    "there are also 15 epochs of photometric observations of this star available from the northern sky variability survey @xcite .",
    "neither of these data sets exhibits periodic brightness variations .",
    "the mean values of the bvs and the bc for this star are @xmath33 and @xmath34 m s@xmath4 .",
    "no correlations between the rv variations and those of the bvs and bc were found with the respective correlation coefficients of r = -0.15 for the bvs and r = -0.06 for the bc .",
    "the only photometric database available for this star originates from the wasp measurements @xcite .",
    "the wasp data are contemporaneous with our rv measurements and give a mean value of @xmath35 , with no detectable periodic variations .",
    "we have also derived bisectors and line curvatures for all the rv measurement epochs , and obtained the mean values of bvs = 149.6@xmath3630.2 m s@xmath4 and bc = 49.4@xmath3627.4 m s@xmath4 .",
    "time variations of these parameters are not correlated with the observed rv variability and yield the corresponding correlation coefficients of r = 0.11 for the bvs and r = -0.08 for the bc time sequences , respectively .",
    "because this star is relatively bright , the only photometry available for it is from 100 hipparcos measurements @xcite , made between mjd 47892 and 48933 .",
    "the mean magnitude of the star calculated from these data is @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , the time series exhibits a marginal ( 2@xmath15 ) , 25.2@xmath360.05-day periodicity with the peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.02 mag .",
    "analysis of the photometric time series divided into shorter sections shows that this oscillation persists over the entire @xmath143-year span of the data and , despite its low amplitude , it has a fap @xmath3 0.001% . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not present in our rv data for this star and it would be hard to envision how could it be related to the observed 647-day rv periodicity .",
    "moreover , the 4.3-day period corresponding to the frequency of maximum power of p - mode oscillations predicted from @xcite is obviously much shorter than observed .",
    "evidently , additional high - cadence photometric observations of hd 96127 are needed to clarify the nature of this 25-day periodicity .",
    "the mean values of the bvs and the bc for this star are @xmath38 and @xmath39 m s@xmath4 and the correlations between the rv and the bvs and bc variations are not significant at r = 0.21 for the bvs and r = 0.17 for the bc , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we report detections of periodic rv variations in three k - giant stars from the list of targets monitored by the ptps program .",
    "the accompanying analyses of the photometric data , as well as of the time variability of line bisectors and bisector curvature indicate that the most likely origin of the observed periodicities is the keplerian motion of substellar companions to these stars .",
    "the most interesting of the three stars is the case of the k0-giant , bd + 48 738 , which , in addition to a @xmath1 0.91 @xmath0 planet moving in a @xmath141 au , @xmath14400-day orbit around the star , exhibits a long - term rv trend , which indicates the presence of another , more distant companion .",
    "the emerging curvature of the long - term rv trend is not yet sufficient to determine whether the object has a substellar mass , or is a low - mass star .    in this context , it is interesting to note that there has been a growing number of detections of substellar companions to giants that have minimum masses in excess of 10 @xmath0 , making them candidates for either brown dwarfs or supermassive planets @xcite . in two cases ,",
    "double brown dwarf - mass companions have been discovered suggesting the possibility that they originated in the circumstellar disk , similar to giant exoplanets @xcite .",
    "if the outer companion to bd + 48 738 proves to be substellar , we may have another interesting case of an inner jupiter - mass planet and a more distant , brown dwarf - mass body orbiting the same star .    in principle , such a system could form from a sufficiently massive protoplanetary disk by means of the standard core accretion mechanism @xcite , with the outer companion having more time than the inner one to accumulate a brown dwarf like mass . a more exotic scenario could be envisioned , in which the inner planet forms in the standard manner , while the outer companion arises from a gravitational instability in the circumstellar disk at the time of the star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    ", it is quite clear that this detection , together with the other ones mentioned above , further emphasizes the possibility that a clear distinction between giant planets and brown dwarfs may be difficult to make ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "the low signal - to - noise planet detections around the k2-giants , hd 240237 and hd 96127 reported in this paper further demonstrate that the intrinsic rv noise in giants restricts the utility of the doppler velocity method , especially in the case of long periods and large orbital radii , for which its sensitivity degrades for dynamical reasons .",
    "this effect has been studied by @xcite , who have shown that the rms rv noise , @xmath40 , of k - giants has a median value of @xmath1420 m s@xmath4 and it tends to increase toward later spectral types .",
    "similarly , a negative correlation has been found between @xmath40 and the stellar surface gravity @xcite .    a short timescale , low amplitude rv noise commonly observed in giants appears to be the manifestation of undersampled solar - like oscillations @xcite . in particular , the recent photometric studies of k - giants by the corot and kepler missions @xcite have shown a prominent presence of such oscillations in these stars .",
    "more specifically , @xcite have proposed that the velocity amplitude associated with the p - mode oscillations scales as @xmath41 ( eqn .",
    "1 ) , or equivalently as @xmath42 , where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the effective temperature and the surface gravity of the star . as shown , for example , by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "observations are in a general agreement with these scalings .    in order to compare the observed trend in the rv data for k - giants to the @xcite prediction more quantitatively ,",
    "we have used the empirical dependencies of b - v color and log(@xmath6 ) on @xmath5 for giants @xcite to generate a semi - analytical function that relates @xmath40 to the observed b - v for different stellar metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the observed 30 values of @xmath40 have been taken from the published discoveries of substellar companions to k - giants in table [ table6 ] , as post - fit residuals after the removal of the keplerian signal from the rv data .",
    "this sample selection has been motivated by the work of @xcite , which shows that amplitudes of rv periodicities in k - giants are generally independent of stellar parameters , whereas the rv noise left over after their removal tends to correlate with the b - v color and anti - correlate with log(@xmath6 ) .",
    "consequently , our approach practically ensures that the remaining short - term noise exceeding the instrumental rv precision is intrinsic to the star , given the observed absence of planets with orbital radii smaller than 0.6 au around k - giants @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the rv precision and sampling patterns characterizing the ongoing gk - giant surveys are quite similar , any selection effects that could influence the rv jitter measurements can be safely ignored .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the measured values of @xmath40 as a function of b - v are compared with the kjeldsen & bedding relationship expressed in terms of these two observables as described above .",
    "the apparent increase of rv noise with the decreasing stellar metallicity becomes more evident , if plotted out directly .",
    "the calculated pearson correlation coefficient for this relationship is -0.71 .",
    "the origin of this trend is most likely related to the fact that higher metallicity ( opacity ) of the star lowers its temperature , which decreases the amplitude of p - mode oscillations , while lower metallicity has the opposite effect .",
    "one interesting consequence of the observed @xmath40-[fe / h ] dependence in k - giants is that it must affect the analyses of a correlation between the planet frequency and metallicity of these stars @xcite .",
    "no clear agreement has been reached so far , as to whether the observed correlation is weaker than in the case of dwarf stars @xcite , or not .",
    "the effect unraveled here creates an apparent preference for higher metallicity stars to be more frequent hosts to orbiting planets , so that the published studies must be biased by this trend .",
