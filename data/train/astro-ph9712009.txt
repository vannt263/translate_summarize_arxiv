    "understanding the structure of the inner parsec of quasars  which includes the line and continuum emitting regions  has proven elusive .",
    "reverberation mapping techniques have been applied to several low - luminosity radio - quiet agn .",
    "though they required large amounts of telescope time , they set on a firm ground basic aspects of the broad line region ( blr ) , i.e. , the stratification of ionization ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "other results are unfortunately more ambiguous .",
    "one reason for the ambiguity resides in our poor understanding of the constraints on the inputs to the line formation processes in the blr ( @xcite ) .",
    "statistical studies of line profiles have in principle the advantage of an approach less dependent on the poorly known physical conditions of the blr .",
    "however they are as yet plagued by small number statistics and by the difficulty of obtaining a uniform sample , in terms of observational ( i.e. , signal - to - noise ratio , s / n ) and intrinsic properties ( such as optical luminosity ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "radio - loud agn have been associated to an extreme in the distribution of parameters of radio - quiet agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "marziani et al . ( 1996 , hereafter m96 ) have shown that radio - loud agn with detected superluminal motion , and apparent velocity @xmath3  show  profiles with low ew and remarkably strong red - ward asymmetry .",
    "there is no equivalent phenomenology in radio - quiet objects .",
    "also , widely spaced double - peaked profiles appear almost exclusively in radio - loud agn ( see @xcite for a critical review , and @xcite )",
    ". statistical analysis of balmer line profiles suggests systemic , kinematic , and structural differences in the blr of ( at least some ) radio - quiet and radio - loud agn ( m96 ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is therefore little evidence that the basic reverberation and profile analysis results can be extended straightforwardly to radio - loud or high luminosity agn . in the handful of radio - loud agn",
    "known to have variable profiles , the profiles are often peculiar ( i.e. , double - peaked ) , as in the cases of 3c 390.3 ( @xcite ) , her twin 3c 382 , oq 208 ( @xcite ) , and pictor a ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is different from the case for radio - quiet agn , since monitored seyfert nuclei do not show double - peaked line profiles .",
    "the most common profile among radio - loud agn , however , is not the extremely broad , double - peaked profile observed in arp 102b ; instead , it is regular , single peaked , red - ward asymmetric with red - ward peak displacement ( m96 ; class ar , r according to @xcite ) .",
    "the double - peaked profiles are probably not representative of the radio - loud agn as a class .",
    "the low redshift ( heliocentric @xmath4 ; m96 ) radio quasar pg  1512 + 370 ( b2  1512 + 37 , 4c  37.43 ) has been frequently observed at optical wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite , among others ) . the  broad profile component ( ) of pg  1512 + 370 belongs to the class ar , r for most epochs of observations , and hence it is fairly typical of radio - loud agn .",
    "variability of broad uv lines  and ly@xmath5has been reported in 1991 from iue observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "these authors suggested the possibility of moderate  line flux variations from published data ( ew ( ) appeared to vary by @xmath6 20 % ) .    in this paper , we report the discovery of  line profile variations in pg  1512 + 370 , and in particular variation of the  blue wing and of a secondary `` blue peak '' from the analysis of spectra collected from 1988 to 1996 (  [ results ] ) . we will attempt to explain the profile and its variations as due to ( a ) accretion disk emission (  [ disk ] ) ; ( b ) radially moving gas (  [ reverber ] ) , or ( c ) a binary blr (  [ bh ] ) .",
    "we summarize the available data in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the initial reduction followed the standard iraf procedures , which include bias subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration , correction for extinction and flux calibration ( also see m96 , and references therein for further details ) .",
    "the spectra have been corrected for redshift , the individual redshifts being determined as the average of the peaks of the gaussian fits to the upper half of @xmath7  and @xmath14959,5007 .    the upper panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the optical spectra for pg  1512 + 370 in the @xmath7   region .",
    "the spectra have been continuum subtracted by fitting a low order polynomial through wavelength regions uncontaminated by emission lines .",
    "most of the weight in the continuum fit has been assigned to : ( 1 ) the region around 4200  as adopted for the quasar composite spectrum by francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and ( 2 ) to the red side of @xmath25007 .",
    "other wavelength regions around 4020  and , with decreasing weight , around 4620  have been included in the fit when available .",
    "the spectra have then been scaled to the same flux of @xmath24959 .",
    "we did not choose @xmath25007 because of the intrinsically larger errors due to the presence of the telluric b band at its red side .",
    "the scale factor determined on the basis of @xmath24959 is affected by the extended appearance of the emission ( diameter @xmath6 4 arcsecs , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the  narrow profile component ( ) flux is difficult to measure , because the underlying  is variable . as a result , measured fluxes",
    "are thought to be accurate within @xmath8%  at a @xmath9 confidence level .",
    "the procedure to remove the contribution of ( which is minimal ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) , ,  and  from the  profile is described in m96 .",
    "table  [ tab : lines ] reports measurements taken on the cleaned  line .",
    "the only signicant change of _ total _  flux recorded in our spectra occurred probably between 1988 and 1990 , when it was @xmath10%  of the 1988 flux .",
    "the larger decrease is observed in the blue wing of   and with a possible smaller decrease in the  red wing . between 1990 and 1996",
    "the  flux remained constant within the observational uncertainties .",
    "no shape change is noticeable in the 1990 , 1992 , and 1994 spectra . at these times",
    ", there is no peak at @xmath11  ( the `` blue peak '' ) or blue shoulder visible and the  profile can be classified as ar , r according to sulentic ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , the line profile showed remarkable changes between 1988 and 1990 as well as between 1995 and 1996 .    1 .",
    "the blue peak is visible in the 1988 spectrum but is apparently absent in 1990 , when the total  flux is also significantly lower .",
    "2 .   the blue wing appears more prominent in the 1995 spectrum but depressed in the 1996 spectrum obtained at spm , with a blue wing fractional flux decrease of @xmath6 20%  .",
    "this variation resembles the one that occurred between 1988 and 1990 , save that the total  flux did not change appreciably in the 1995 and 1996 observations .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the difference between the 1995 and 1996 spectra in the  region .",
    "the slight depression in the 4925 - 5025  region is due to the extended nature of , as different contribution from extra - nuclear probably fell within the slit in the 1995 and 1996 spectra . to compute the probability that the observed change in line profile shape is due to random noise fluctuation , we first estimated the 3@xmath12  noise level from the observed maximum noise fluctuations over the average signal in the rest frame range 5060 - 5100    ( much larger than the noise correlation length @xmath13 pixels ) .",
    "we rebinned the spectrum ( over the wavelength range where we observe a change ) with a step @xmath14 .",
    "we then multiplied the probability that the change in amplitude for each bin is due to noise ( which is assumed constant over the  line wing ) .",
    "we find the probability that the blue wing change between 1995 - 1996 is due to random noise fluctuations is negligibly small .",
    "similar considerations apply to the 1990 - 1988  line profile difference ( not shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the remaining question at this point is whether the blue peak may or may not be variable in radial velocity .",
    "the ability to resolve the `` blue shoulder '' into a `` blue peak '' depends on the spectral resolution of the data .",
    "the 1988 and 1996 ( asiago ) spectra have a resolution of 3   and 2   fwhm respectively .",
    "the blue peak is well visible at @xmath15  ( in 1988 ) and @xmath16  ( in 1996 ) with respect to the radial velocity of .",
    "the 1995 - 1996 difference has a broad gaussian shape , with maximum at @xmath17  .",
    "radial velocity values of the blue peak measured in 1988 , 1995 , and 1996 are therefore consistent .",
    "the possibility that the blue peak is present in the 1990 , 1992 , and 1994 spectra but not visible because of the lower resolution can not be ruled out .",
    "after all , the blue flat top observed in the 1996 san pedro martir spectrum is resolved as a blue peak in the 1996 asiago spectrum , collected 30 days earlier , when the blue wing appeared depressed .",
    "two interpretations seem possible .    1 .",
    "the blue peak is a component of  more variable than the rest of , at approximately constant @xmath18 . in this case",
    ", the blue peak ( i ) may be due to a flux redistribution within  unrelated to continuum changes or ( ii ) may be a structure produced by response to continuum variation .",
    "both the 1988 and 1995 spectra ( when the blue wing was more prominent ) show the highest continuum fluxes .",
    "this suggests that an enhancement of the blue wing is related to an increase of the continuum level .",
    "however , as the total  flux did not change significantly in all our spectra obtained between 1990 and 1996 , it is also possible , albeit less likely , that we are observing a line flux redistribution unrelated to continuum variations ( as in ngc 5548 ; @xcite ) .",
    "model implications are discussed in  [ reverber ] .",
    "if the disappearance of the blue peak in 1990 - 1994 is genuine , the radial velocity of the peak in the blue wing may have changed to @xmath6 0@xmath19 in 1990 , 1992 , and 1994 . in  [ bh ]",
    "we discuss a possible model .",
    "the observed  profile as a whole is not consistent with the predictions of disk models at any epoch of observation .",
    "nevertheless , if we wanted to interpret the secondary peak @xmath20   as the doppler - boosted peak of a disk contribution , we would need a disk with @xmath21 , @xmath22  following chen &  halpern ( 1989 ) .",
    "non - conventional disk models ( elliptical disks or warped disks ; @xcite ; @xcite ) may be more successful in fitting the  line profile at a given epoch . however , the variation observed between 1988 and 1990 and between 1995 and 1996 rules out the possibility of `` switched - on '' disk emission , since the  change appears to be restricted to the blue wing in both cases ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the observed variation would require implausible changes of the disk parameters from one epoch to another .",
    "the moderate change in the  blue wing flux , @xmath23% , without a simultaneous response in the red wing , points toward line emission from gas whose motion is predominantly radial .",
    "given the observed blueshift and assuming optically thin clouds , as it is generally believed to be the case for most  emitting clouds , the gas must be moving outwards .",
    "we are not saying here that the  line emission is due exclusively to outflowing gas , but that a fraction related to the blue peak most probably is .",
    "without further data , it is however not possible to elaborate on this result .",
    "caution is needed as the temporal sampling of our spectra is quite probably not sufficient to constrain line and continuum variations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  line luminosity is l()@xmath24  for h@xmath25  mpc@xmath26 , and q@xmath27 . under the assumptions of menzel - baker recombination theory ,",
    "the light travel time across the blr is @xmath28  days .",
    "spectra obtained at a frequency of @xmath29 1 month@xmath26  are desirable .",
    "if the time scale for continuum variation is found to be comparable to @xmath30 , then `` ripples '' in the line profile could be produced by reverberation effects .    at 20 cm , on a first map ( @xcite ) ,",
    "pg 1512 + 370 appears as a double - lobed radio source , with lobes extending up to a projected linear distance of @xmath31 400 kpc from the central core , at p. a. @xmath6 105@xmath32 .",
    "integral field spectroscopy revealed two  emitting regions approximately aligned along the east - west direction with the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "our 1996 spectrum also revealed the eastern emitting region as a `` blob '' , at @xmath33 , in excellent agreement with the results of durret et al .",
    "extended emitting regions in radio quasars show a statistical tendency to align with the radio - source axis in radio - loud , steep spectrum quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "extended   provides some evidence in favor of outflowing gas related to the presence of radio ejecta ( see the discussion by @xcite for pg  1512 + 370 ) .",
    "we consider it unlikely that the blue peak is due to some out - flowing gas that is episodically related to the radio jet .",
    "the dynamical time - scale for the blr is probably shorter than 8 years ; a blob moving at @xmath34   could not have maintained the same radial velocity over that time period .      within the errors in our spectra",
    ", the  profile variations can be ascribed to a stationary profile plus a superimposed component of variable radial velocity , contributing up to @xmath35%   of the total  line flux . in a binary blr framework ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we assume that the secondary component is observed at @xmath36  ( in any case at @xmath37 ) between 1990 and 1994 ( i.e. , not clearly observed because it underlies the ) .",
    "this assumption is justified since the  underlying the  may be variable ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , and a slightly redshifted `` shoulder '' partly underlying  may be identified in the 1996 ( spm ) spectrum .",
    "the `` shoulder '' close to  is less prominent in 1995 , when the blue wing was in turn much stronger .",
    "this interpretation is not fully satisfactory because the 1988 and 1996 asiago spectra are of higher dispersion than the remaining spectra .",
    "the blue peak is resolved in the 1996 asiago spectrum but not in the 1996 san pedro martir spectrum , because of the lower resolution ( the two spectra were obtained 30 days apart ) .",
    "the same may be true for the 1990 , 1992 , and 1994 spectra .",
    "if we accept the blue peak as a component of variable radial velocity , then the immediate implication for the orbit of a binary black hole system is that it is highly eccentric , and that the binary must have mass ratio very different from unity . from the observed - frame core - to - lobe flux ratio r = 0.091 measured on the first map ( 1.4 ghz ) we can estimate the angle between the line of sight and the radio axis .",
    "it is known that the relationship between r and orientation is valid in a statistical sense , probably because of a large intrinsic scatter in the the lorentz factor of the jet ( @xmath38 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and in the ratio f between the intrinsic jet luminosity and the unbeamed luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can write r as r = f @xmath39 , where @xmath40  is the doppler factor , and p = 2.75 for a continuous jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume @xmath415 , and we use f = @xmath42   ( @xcite ) , as appropriate for fanaroff - riley type ii radio sources .",
    "we obtain an inclination @xmath43 . for more extreme values of @xmath44 , namely for @xmath45  and @xmath46",
    ", we obtain i=15@xmath32   ( f= @xmath47 ) and i= 26@xmath32   ( f=@xmath48 ) respectively .",
    "to assume @xmath43  seems therefore reasonable .",
    "pg 1512 + 370 may have been excluded from superluminal motion searches , since its radio emission is lobe - dominated .",
    "however , at @xmath43  and @xmath49 , we expect that pg 1512 + 370 should be superluminal with apparent transverse velocity @xmath50   ( also if @xmath51 , which implies i=26@xmath32 , we should observe @xmath52 1.7 ) .    if @xmath53 , an acceptable fit to the six observed radial velocities ( @xmath541.76 ) is obtained for binary period @xmath55 yr , eccentricity @xmath56 , and semi - major axis @xmath57  cm .",
    "this solution corresponds to a total mass for the binary of @xmath58 .",
    "the evolution of massive black hole binaries orbital parameters ( semi - major axis , eccentricity ) for several mass ratios has been studied recently by @xcite . from figure  8 of his work",
    "we infer that e @xmath59 for @xmath60  cm is somewhat too large for any value of the initial eccentricity of the binary , save possibly for the case of initial eccentricity @xmath61 . in this case , pg  1512 + 370 should be in a very - short lived phase of the binary evolution : high eccentricity drives large gravitational radiation losses that should lead to the merging of the two black holes in @xmath62 yr .",
    "for the lower power fanaroff - riley type i radio source oj 287 the case for a double black hole is stronger ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and rather similar orbital parameters are found : @xmath63 , @xmath64 yr , @xmath65  ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the blazar nature of oj 287 and the absence of obvious line emission is due to doppler - boosted continuum emission , then pg 1512 + 370 and oj 287 may both host a binary black hole whose orbital plane is observed at different inclination .",
    "we have presented evidence of moderate variations ( @xmath66 30% total line flux , with the largest variations occurring in the blue wing ) in the  of pg  1512 + 370 from the analysis of spectra obtained from 1988 to 1996 .",
    "a peak displaced by @xmath67  with respect to the radial velocity of   ( the `` blue peak '' ) has been observed in 1988 and 1996 .",
    "we have attempted to interpret the observations according to a number of presently fashionable blr models : accretion disk emission (  [ disk ] ) ; radially moving gas , and , in particular , emission due to gas trapped by the radio jet (  [ reverber ] ) ; a binary blr (  [ bh ] ) . only radially moving gas ( but not occasionally associated to the radio jet ) and a binary blr are probably appropriate .",
    "this is one of the few cases where evidence from line profiles may support the presence of a binary blr ( with the cautionary note of  [ bh ] ) , although the eccentricity inferred from the observed radial velocity curve may be too high for the estimated major axis . like",
    "oj 287 , pg 1512 + 370 would then be a very peculiar object observed in a very short - lived phase of its existence .",
    "however , we favor the idea that if  variations are the response to ionizing continuum changes , the presence of the blue peak and the observed variations of the  blue wing may be indicative of radial motion within the blr",
    ". the blue peak may hence be a `` ripple '' produced by light echoes .",
    "indeed , we expect that the blue peak will be detected by future observations at the same @xmath20  therefore ruling out the binary black hole model altogether ( as in the case of 3c 390.3 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a set of high s / n ratio spectra with a good temporal coverage is necessary in order to test the proposed hypotheses .",
