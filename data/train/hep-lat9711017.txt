    "deriving the light hadron spectrum from the first principles of qcd has been a major subject of lattice qcd simulations@xcite .",
    "a precise determination of the known hadron spectrum would lead us to a fundamental verification of qcd .",
    "we should also clarify the nature of observed hadrons , provide predictions for hadrons not in the quark model , and give informations for quantities of phenomenological importance .    in order to achieve these goals , understanding and control of various systematic errors are required .",
    "one of major sources of systematic errors is that of a finite lattice spacing .",
    "recent progress in reducing this systematic error has been made in two ways .",
    "for the quenched qcd spectrum , development of computer power has enabled to push simulations toward smaller lattice spacings on physically larger lattices with higher statistics than the previous attempts . as a result",
    "we are now in a status to discuss the problem of how well quenched qcd describes the experimental spectrum .",
    "another progress in reducing scaling violation is brought with the use of improved quark actions .",
    "tests of improvement , previously made mainly in quenched qcd , have been extended this year to full qcd .",
    "finite size effects and chiral extrapolations have been studied extensively in the past .",
    "several studies to investigate these systematic errors were also reported at the symposium .    in this review",
    "we attempt to describe the present status of spectroscopic studies .",
    "progress in quenched qcd spectrum is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : progress ] , emphasizing results in the continuum limit .",
    "discussions on several issues in spectroscopic studies follow in sec .  [",
    "sec : issues ] , which include study of finite size effects , chiral extrapolations , and quenching error in meson decay constants .",
    "after discussions on improvement of quark actions in sec .",
    "[ sec : improve ] , attempts toward a realistic calculation in full qcd are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : fullqcd ] .",
    "[ sec : other ] is devoted to results for masses of glueballs and exotics .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "recent quenched simulations made with the plaquette gauge action are compiled in table [ tab : table - q ] .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : improve ] for those with improved gauge actions .",
    "deriving precise quenched results in the continuum limit is a first step toward understanding the light hadron spectrum .",
    "the gf11 collaboration@xcite carried out the first systematic effort to achieve this goal with the wilson quark action using three lattices with @xmath0 gev and the spatial size @xmath1 fm .",
    "this year the cp - pacs collaboration reported further effort in this direction@xcite .",
    "they made high statistics simulations on four lattices with @xmath2 gev and @xmath3 fm .",
    "hadron masses are calculated for five quark masses corresponding to @xmath4 = 0.75 , 0.7 , 0.6 , 0.5 and 0.4 , the last point being closer to the chiral limit than ever attempted for the wilson action .",
    "they reported continuum values of hadron masses with a statistical error of 0.5 % for mesons and 13 % for baryons .",
    "another trend in this year s simulations is a pursuit of reduction of scaling violation with the use of the sheikholeslami - wohlert@xcite or clover action .",
    "efforts in this direction were made by the ukqcd@xcite and jlqcd @xcite collaborations for the tadpole - improved@xcite clover action and by the ukqcd , qcdsf@xcite and apetov@xcite collaborations for the non - perturbatively @xmath5-improved@xcite clover action ( see also ref.@xcite on this subject ) .",
    "these studies have not yet reached the level of simulations with the wilson action , being restricted to the parameter range @xmath6 , @xmath7 gev , and @xmath8 fm .    for the kogut - susskind ( ks )",
    "quark action , the milc collaboration@xcite last year reported a result of nucleon mass in the continuum limit based on simulations on four lattices with @xmath9 gev and @xmath10 fm .",
    "not much progress has been made this year@xcite .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     with progress of our understanding of the quenched spectrum , increasingly larger efforts are beginning to be spent in simulations of full qcd .",
    "here we summarize recent work listed in table [ tab : table - f ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the milc collaboration@xcite continued their study of the @xmath11 ks spectrum for @xmath12 employing large lattices of a size @xmath13  fm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ed - ks - nf2 ] we show their results in the edinburgh plot together with those of previous studies@xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 decreases toward weak coupling . taking advantage of improved precision of their results as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : ed - ks - nf2 ] , the milc collaboration attempted a continuum extrapolation of @xmath14 for a fixed value of @xmath4 .",
    "they find @xmath15 at the physical point in the continuum limit",
    ".    also of interest is the problem of how the ks spectrum depends on the number of dynamical quark flavors .",
    "columbia group@xcite showed that the four flavor hadron spectrum is nearly parity doubled on a @xmath16 lattice at @xmath17 .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking effects are smaller for four flavors than for two or zero flavors .",
    "simulations of full qcd with the wilson quark action for @xmath18=2 have been pushed forward by the sesam@xcite and t@xmath19l@xcite collaborations .",
    "simulations were initially made at @xmath20 on a @xmath21 spatial lattice ( @xmath22 fm ) for @xmath23 ( sesam ) , which have been extended to those on a larger lattice @xmath24 ( @xmath25 fm ) and closer to the chiral limit with @xmath260.7 and 0.55 ( t@xmath19l ) .",
    "an important aspect of their study is a careful examination of various algorithmic issues of full qcd simulation , including development and tuning of efficient wilson marix inverter@xcite and a detailed autocorrelation study .    for the spectrum",
    ", they observed 3% ( 5% ) finite - size effects for @xmath27-meson ( nucleon ) at @xmath28 .",
    "the magnitude is comparable to that for the ks action@xcite .",
    "they estimated strange hadron masses , treating the strange quark as a valence quark in the presence of two light dynamical quarks .",
    "the @xmath29 mass splitting is smaller than experiment by 15% , contrary to the expectation that dynamical sea quark effects alleviate the small hyperfine splitting of quenched qcd .",
    "it is possible that dynamical quarks employed is still too heavy to improve the splitting significantly .",
    "sesam and t@xmath19l also studied the static potential and several hadron matrix elements to explore effects of sea quarks .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "till last year there were only sporadic attempts toward full qcd simulations of the light hadron spectrum with improved actions@xcite .",
    "this year the cp - pacs collaboration@xcite and the ukqcd collaboration@xcite presented preliminary results of a systematic attempt in this direction .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration made a comparative study of improvement at a coarse lattice @xmath30 gev employing the plaquette and an rg - improved action@xcite for gluons and the wilson and tadpole - improved clover action for quarks .",
    "for one action combination , they also explored the chiral limit down to @xmath31 with simulations on a @xmath16 lattice .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration employed the plaquette action at @xmath32 and the clover action with a clover coefficient of 1.76 .",
    "simulations were made for four values of sea quark masses and the spectrum is calculated for four values of valence quark masses on each dynamical quark ensemble .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in fig.[fig : rho07 ] we compile full qcd results for @xmath14 as a function of @xmath33 , both calculated at @xmath26 0.7 .",
    "results for the wilson quark action have large scaling violation and approximately lie on a single curve , irrespective of the choice of gauge actions .",
    "in contrast the lattice spacing dependence is much weaker for the clover actions , again irrespective of the gauge action , and the value of the ratio is close to a phenomenological estimate even on a very coase lattice of @xmath34 gev .",
    "these results show that a significant improvement of @xmath14 due to the clover term observed for the quenched case also holds in full qcd .",
    "another interesting question in full qcd is to what extent the lattice scale obtained from the hadron spectrum agrees with that from the static potential .",
    "the clover term is important also in this regard .",
    "a mismatch of the scale determined from @xmath35 in the chiral limit and that with the string tension observed for the wilson action at @xmath34 gev is much reduced by the use of the clover action@xcite .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration reported that the scale determined from @xmath36 approximately agrees with that from @xmath37 for each value of dynamical quark .",
    "for an effect of improvement of gauge actions , rotational symmetry of the potential is improved to a great extent also in full qcd@xcite .",
    "the effects of improvement summarized here are parallel to those observed in quenched qcd , and come mainly from valence quarks rather than dynamical sea quarks .",
    "novertheless , they are important since they show that realistic full qcd simulations are possible without having to reduce the lattice spacing below @xmath38 gev which is needed with the standard action .",
    "calculation of glueball masses in quenched qcd has reached a stage to pinpoint the mass ranges at least for the scalar glueball .",
    "the gf11 collaboration@xcite reported @xmath39 mev as the infinite volume value in the continuum from a reanalysis of their data@xcite .",
    "this value is consistent or slightly higher than the previous results by other groups@xcite .",
    "the central effort of the gf11 collaboration has been a calculation of the mass of the @xmath40 scalar meson@xcite , for which they found values below @xmath41 mev .",
    "they conclude that the observed meson @xmath42 is mainly a scalar glueball , while @xmath43 is mainly an @xmath40 quarkonium .",
    "the sesam collaboration@xcite made a glueball mass measurement with their full qcd runs .",
    "no clear dynamical quark effects are seen in the glueball masses .",
    "instead , they observed strong finite size effects in the scalar glueball mass , which may be an indication of the presence of mixing between the glueball and the @xmath40 scalar meson .",
    "two groups have contributions for spin exotic meson masses .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration@xcite increased statistics since last year .",
    "calculating masses at one combination of @xmath44 and the quark mass and employing a model to estimate masses at the strange quark , they obtained @xmath45 mev .",
    "the milc collaboration@xcite made simulations at @xmath44=5.85 and 6.15 .",
    "extrapolation to the strange quark mass was made to obtain @xmath46 mev .",
    "the two results are consistent within 10% .",
    "a number of interesting studies have been made this year , making a step forward toward a precise determination of the light hadron spectrum .    for the quenched spectrum ,",
    "a systematic deviation from experiment has been uncovered both in the meson and baryon sectors .",
    "quantitative results have been accumulated with improved actions both for quenched and full qcd , clarifiing to what extent improving actions reduce scaling violations in the light hadron spectrum .",
    "quenched clover simulations are moving toward high precision determination of physical quantities exploiting the improved scaling behavior , and similar effort should be pursued with other improved actions .    and",
    "finally , attempts toward a realistic simulation in full qcd have begun . in my opinion , there is real hope that such a calculation could be achieved with the current generation of computers through application of improved actions .",
    "+ i am deeply indebted to all the colleagues who made their results available to me before the conference .",
    "i also would like to thank y.  iwasaki and a.  ukawa for critical comments and suggestions on the manuscript .",
