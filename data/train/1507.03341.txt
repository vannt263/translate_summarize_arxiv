    "scattering of incident waves by inhomogeneities is a common physical feature in optics and quantum mechanics .",
    "the trigonometric pschl - teller ( pt ) potential was suggested by pschl and teller @xcite to describe diatomic molecular vibration .",
    "pt - type potentials have been noticed by authors from different areas of physics ranging from the molecular physics to the nuclear one . using different approximation methods , analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation and energy eigenvalues for diatomic molecules",
    "have been found for the trigonometric pt molecular potential @xcite .",
    "approximate bound - state solutions of the klein - gordon @xcite and dirac @xcite equations with such potentials have been investigated . the sech - squared potential ( or modified pt potential )",
    "has attracted too too much attention , for instance it appears in the context of neutron - matter @xcite and spherical quantum dot @xcite .",
    "there are obstacles , called reflectionless potentials , which are completely transparent for the incident wave .",
    "this type of potentials have been extensively studied analytically and numerically in the literature . using the method of summation over eigenstates ,",
    "the exact propagator for a general reflectionless potential has been computed @xcite .",
    "scattering of a gaussian wavepacket by a reflectionless sech2 potential has been numerically studied and possible applications of such potentials has been argued @xcite . it has been shown that in comparison to the case of free evolution , the wavepacket accelerates in the well and is narrower .",
    "authors arrived at this result by plotting the probability density versus position in a time that the whole wavepacket has left the well . in this paper",
    "we employ the concept of arrival time @xcite for quantitative study of this problem . in the case of reflectionless sech2 potential non - reflecting wavepackets",
    "have been constructed by superposing energy eigenstates and propagation of them has been studied in the presence of the above potential @xcite .",
    "similar results have been reproduced by the method of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "traversal time through the reflectionless sech2 potential has been studied using the method of a quantum clock @xcite .",
    "only , recently , a true reflectionless potential was realized experimentally in photonic lattices using the concept of arrays of evanescently couple waveguides @xcite .",
    "it seems to be interesting to consider the problem of a wavepacket scattering by the reflectionless sech2 potential using a trajectory - based theory , since by attributing a well - defined trajectory to a particle , its arrival time at a detector location is a well - defined and predictable quantity .",
    "it has been shown within the bohmian mechanics @xcite that the arrival time distribution is given by the probability current density @xcite .",
    "but , there is no consensus about this quantity within the standard formulation of the quantum mechanics @xcite .    to this end",
    ", we at first follow lekner @xcite to construct a non - reflecting wavepacket .",
    "then , propagation of such a constructed wavepacket is considered and arrival time at a detector location behind the well is computed .",
    "comparison with a freely evolving gaussian wavepacket is made .",

    "using eq . ( [ eq : nonref_packet ] ) probability density and probability current density becomes @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\sigma_t } \\exp \\left [ - \\frac{(x - x_c - ut)^2}{2 \\sigma_t^2 } \\right ] ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath31~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33~ , % % \\\\ f_2(x , t ) & = & 4 \\hbar t \\bigg [ a^2 \\sigma_0 ^ 4 ( x - x_c ) + k_0 ^ 2 \\sigma_0 ^ 4 ( x - x_c ) -   a \\sigma_0 ^ 2 ( \\sigma_0 ^ 2 + 4 k_0 ^ 2 \\sigma_0 ^ 4 - ( x - x_c)^2 )",

    "thus , in the free space one has @xmath34 for the freely evolving gaussian wavepacket this equation reads , @xmath35 in the bohmian view of the world , the state of a system is described by its wave function together with its actual configuration defined by the actual position of its particle . in the minimal approach to the theory @xcite , particle equation of motion , known as guidance equation , is @xmath36 using this equation and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nonref_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : nonref_cur ] ) , one obtains @xmath37 for the initial bohmian velocity of a particle which is guided by the nonreflecting wave packet ( [ eq : nonref_packet ] ) .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vb_initial_nonref ] ) that initial velocity depends on the position in the nonreflecting wavepacket case , while it is constant value @xmath38 for the gaussian packet . by integrating guidance equation ( [ eq : v_bohm ] ) over time one obtains @xmath39 for the trajectories of a free particle which is guided by the gaussian packet ( [ eq : free_gaussian ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath40 is the initial position of the particle .    within the bohmian mechanics ,",
    "the arrival time distribution of particles at detector location @xmath41 is given by @xcite @xmath42 and thus the mean arrival time reads @xmath43",
    "in order to do numerical calculations , we apply a scaling transformation which eliminates physical constant @xmath44 and mass @xmath45 in the schrdinger equation for free particle and for a particle interacting with sech2 potential ( [ eq : sech2pot ] ) .",
    "wavefunction @xmath46 which describes a particle of mass @xmath47 in the potential ( [ eq : sech2pot ] ) with @xmath3 , satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath48 by space transformation @xmath49 , which is a scaling of unit length @xcite , and defining new function @xmath50 schrdinger equation ( [ eq : sch eq ] ) reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "thus , transformed momentum operator is @xmath53 .",
    "( [ eq : modifed sch eq ] ) says that the above scale transformation corresponds to put @xmath54 in the equations of section [ sec : basic_eqs ] .",

    "for numerical calculations , transformed parameters of the potential and wavepacket are taken as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rho ] , we have plotted transformed probability density @xmath63 versus transformed space coordinate @xmath64 at six different instants . a gap at the center of the potential is seen in the plot of interacting nonreflecting wavepacket . with respect to",
    "the relation @xmath65 , for a given width @xmath66 of @xmath67 , corresponding width in @xmath68 is proportional to the inverse of square root of mass .",
    "thus , from the forth equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transformations ] ) it follows that by increasing the mass , the width of probability density decreases . with the above values for the parameters of the wavepacket one obtains by numerical integration @xmath69 for the normalization constant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonref_packet ] ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the initial nonreflecting wavepacket . because of the relation @xmath72 , expectation value of space coordinate of the nonreflecting wavepacket , @xmath73 , in the free - space moves faster than the center of the gaussian wavepacket .",
    "in addition , in the interacting case because potential is attractive , wavepacket moves faster when the wavepacket approaches the well .",
    "after , passing the potential it moves with constat velocity .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_del ] .",
    "it must be noted that potential is proportional to the inverse of mass .",
    "thus , it is more attractive for low masses .",
    "so , wavepackets describing particles with low values of mass move faster in comparison to the large ones . as one sees in plot",
    "b ) of figure [ fig : ex_del ] uncertainty in position , @xmath74 , is larger for the interacting nonreflecting wavepacket compared to the freely evolving gaussian wavepacket . in figure",
    "[ fig : arriv_dis_xd ] we have plotted arrival time distribution ( [ eq : arr_dis ] ) at the detector location @xmath75 .",
    "relation @xmath65 means fixing @xmath41 and changing @xmath76 corresponds to changing mass . from plots ( a ) and ( b ) of this figure",
    "it is found that the width - in - time of the arrival time distribution increases with @xmath76 ( mass ) in contrast to the width - in - space of the detection probability density @xmath77 where width - in - space in a given time decreases with mass .",
    "plot ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : arriv_dis_xd ] shows the mean arrival time ( [ eq : mean_arr ] ) . in agreement with the previous findings , @xmath78 is the lowest for the interacting nonreflecting wavepacket while is the largest for the free gaussian .",
    "for all types of packets mean arrival time increases with @xmath79 ( mass ) .",
    "figure [ fig : traj ] represents a selection of bohmian paths . in plot ( a ) , trajectories ( [ eq : bohm_tarj_g ] ) for the free gaussian have been plotted , while in plot ( c ) trajectories are for a particle which is guided by the wavepacket @xmath80 . in agreement with plot ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_del ] , trajectories spread out more in the case of interacting nonreflecting packet . in plot ( c )",
    "we have depicted @xmath81 and the bohm path with initial position @xmath82 .",
    "it is seen that the bohm path overtakes the expectation value of space coordinate .",
    "plot ( d ) represents initial bohmian velocity ( [ eq : vb_initial_nonref ] ) versus space coordinate @xmath64 .",
    "as one sees , velocity is higher for the interacting nonreflecting wavepacket compared to the free gaussian .",
    "in this work we constructed a nonreflecting wavepacket by superposing of eigenstates of the reflectionless sech2 potential .",
    "then , evolution of this wavepacket in the presence of the potential and in free space studied and compared to the free propagation of gaussian wavepacket .",
    "it was found that nonreflecting wavepacket moves faster and its width , uncertainty in position , is larger .",
    "mean arrival time at a detector behind the well was computed as a function of mass .",
    "it was seen mean arrival time increases with mass in agreement with one s intuition and it is the largest for the free gaussian compared to the nonreflecting wavepacket in free space and in the interacting case . finally , a selection of bohmian trajectories were computed .",
