    "the investigation of nearby seyfert galaxies with polarimetric observations provides unique information on the nuclear structure of these objects .",
    "this information is of particular importance when studying unification models of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the standard unified model for seyfert galaxies proposes that all types of seyfert galaxy are fundamentally the same , however , the presence of a dusty molecular `` torus '' obscures the broad line emission in many systems . in this picture",
    "the classification of seyfert 1 or 2 depends on the inclination angle of the torus to the line of sight ( antonucci , 1993 ) . the most convincing evidence for this unified model comes from optical spectropolarimetry .",
    "using this technique , the scattered radiation from the broad line region ( blr ) of many seyfert  2 galaxies is revealed in the form of broad lines in the polarized flux ( e.g.  antonucci and miller , 1985 , young , 1996a , heisler , lumsden and bailey , 1997 ) .    near ",
    "ir imaging polarimetry provides valuable information on the nature of the polarizing source ( e.g.  lumsden , 1999 , tadhunter , 1999 , young , 1996b , packham , 1996 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "for example , in ngc1068 , bipolar scattering cones are clearly detected in polarized flux ( young 1996b , packham 1997 ) and the torus itself has been viewed in silhouette in the h band ( young 1996b ) .",
    "interestingly , the structure of the scattering cones often coincide with ground - based narrow band imaging ( e.g. wilson and tsvetanov , 1994 ) and high resolution hst imaging ( e.g. capetti 1997 , falcke , wilson and simpson , 1998 ) . since the unified model infers the presence of a dusty torus obscuring the seyfert 1 core , we expect that longer wavelength polarimetry will be able to probe deeper into regions within the plane of the torus and to see scattering from the nucleus which might otherwise be shielded from view at optical wavelengths .",
    "circinus is a nearby ( 4mpc ) highly inclined ( 65@xmath5 , freeman 1977 ) sb - sd galaxy . at this distance ,",
    "the spatial scale is 20pc / arcsec .",
    "it is seen through a low interstellar extinction window near the galactic plane ( a@xmath1 = 1.5 mag ; freeman 1977 ) .",
    "the nuclear optical line ratios are typical of a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "this classification as a type 2 is also supported by the detection of intense coronal lines ( oliva 1994 ) , the intense x - ray fe 6.4 kev line ( matt 1996 ) , rapid variation of powerful h@xmath3o maser emission and a prominent ionization cone in [ oiii]5007 with filamentary supersonic outflows ( marconi 1994 ) .",
    "recent optical spectropolarimetry ( oliva , 1998 and alexander , 1999a ) has shown a scattered polarized broad h@xmath6 line and therefore a hidden seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "other characteristics include enhanced star forming activity in the form of a star - forming ring of 200pc in size ( marconi 1994 ) , a compton thick nucleus at x - ray energies ( matt 1996 ) and an unresolved nuclear source ( @xmath71.5pc ) at 2@xmath8 m ( maiolino 1998 ) .",
    "since it is already known from optical spectropolarimetry that the circinus galaxy harbours a hidden type 1 nucleus and the optical ionization cone suggests the presence of an obscuring / collimating torus , this galaxy is an ideal candidate to test the theoretical models of unified schemes .",
    "the dusty nature of the circinus galaxy favours near - ir polarimetry over optical polarimetry due to the lower optical depth at near - ir wavelengths .    in this paper we present near ",
    "ir imaging polarimetry revealing , for the first time , a biconical emission region .",
    "we investigate the nature of this emission in the context of the standard unified model of seyfert galaxies .",
    ".nuclear polarization [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      alexander ( 1999a ) modelled the optical and k  band spectropolarimetry data of the circinus galaxy with scattering , and a dichroic component through the dusty torus corresponding to a visual extinction of a@xmath1 = 35 mags .",
    "in the present study , we have the advantage of being able to constrain the scattered flux with both the spatially resolved information of the images and the extra wavelength coverage with the j and h band images . from this",
    "we determine that the ratio of scattered intensity to that from the direct view is higher than that found by alexander ( 1999a ) , which explains the difference in the modelled extinction .",
    "we achieved a good fit to our polarized images with a torus radius of approximately 16  pc .",
    "this is substantially smaller than the size of the torus determined for ngc1068 of @xmath0 180 pc ( efstathiou , hough & young 1995 ; young 1996b ; packham 1997 ) , but larger than that estimated for cen a , @xmath02pc ( alexander 1999b ) .    modelling the polarized flux images of circinus only allowed us to place an upper limit for the electron scattering number density , together with a lower limit for the visual extinction through the torus to the near - ir emission region .",
    "however , the lower the scatterer s number density , the higher the boost factor ( the ratio of the actual luminosity of the source to the observed polarized luminosity ) . scattering number densities",
    "significantly less than the upper limits , greater than a factor of 1020 , result in a boost factor that , using the scattered broad  flux of 4.3@xmath9 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 ( alexander 1999a ) , implies a broad  luminosity in the top 40 percent of all seyfert galaxies , while its infrared luminosity is in the lower 20 percent .",
    "this argues that the number density of scatterers must be within a factor of 10 of the upper limit .",
    "we have presented near  infrared polarimetric images of the circinus galaxy showing a clear bipolar scattering cone in the j band .",
    "the south  east cone was previously undetected at optical wavelengths because it was hidden behind the heavy extinction of the galactic disk . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the h and k band images show more compact structures due to the dominance of dichroic absorption over scattered radiation .",
    "we have successfully applied an adapted version of the y95 model to interpret the observed polarized flux distribution .",
    "this model includes two geometrical identical scattering cones , diametrically opposite to each other , with the forward cone in the south  east direction at a position angle of 125@xmath5 and an opening half angle of 45@xmath5 .",
    "the inclination of the system to the line of sight is 50@xmath5 .",
    "the estimated optical extinction a@xmath1 to the nucleus through the torus is @xmath266 mag .",
    "we estimate that the putative torus in the circinus galaxy has an outer radius of @xmath016pc .",
