    "one of most exiting predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes , objects from which no physical objects or signals can get loose of their drag due to its strong gravitational field .",
    "going far beyond astrophysics , black holes appears as objects that may help us to clarify one of the most intriguing bone of contention in the current days , the quantum nature of gravity .",
    "it is because , in the presence of a black hole strong gravitational field , the quantum nature of spacetime must be manifested .",
    "loop quantum gravity is a theory that has given ascent to models that provide a portrait of the quantum features of spacetime unveiled by a black hole . in particular , in the context of this theory , a black hole metric known as loop black hole ( lqbh ) , or self - dual black hole @xcite , has been proposed .",
    "this solution corresponds to a quantum corrected schwarzschild solution and possess the interesting property of self - duality . from this property ,",
    "the black hole singularity is removed and replaced by another asymptotically flat region , which is an expected effect in a quantum gravity regime .",
    "moreover , lqbhs have been pointed as the building blocks of a holographic version of loop quantum cosmology @xcite .    on the other hand , in order to move black holes from a simple mathematical solution of the gravitational equations to objects which existence in nature is possible , a key point is investigate black hole stability under perturbations .",
    "it is due to the fact that an isolated black hole would never been found in nature .",
    "in fact , complex distributions of matter such as accretion disks , galactic nuclei , strong magnetic fields , other stars , etc are always present around black holes , which in turn actively interact with their surrounding .",
    "even if all macroscopic objects and fields in space have been removed , a black hole will interact with the vacuum around it , creating pairs of particles and evaporating due to hawking phenomena .",
    "besides , in the first moments after its formation , a black hole is in a perturbed state due to gravitational collapse of matter . in this way , a real black hole will be always in a perturbed state .",
    "black hole s response to a perturbation occurs by emitting gravitational waves whose evolution corresponds , firstly , to a relatively short period of initial outburst of radiation followed by a phase where the black hole get going to vibrating into exponentially decaying oscillations , ",
    "quasinormal modes , whose frequencies and decay times depend only on the intrinsic characteristics of the black hole itself , being indifferent to the details of the collapse . finally , at a very large time , the quasinormal modes are slapped down by power - law or exponential late - time tails .",
    "the issue of black hole stability under perturbations was firstly addressed by regge - wheeler @xcite and zerilli @xcite , which based on black hole perturbation theory , have demonstrated the stability of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the methods used are familiar from quantum mechanics : perturbations caused by an external ( eg . , gravitational or electromagnetic ) field are taken into account as waves scattering off the respective potential .",
    "it is due to the fact that the regge - wheller / zerilli formalism gets rid of the angular dependence of the perturbation variables through a tensorial generalization of the spherical harmonics , thus translating the solution of the perturbed einstein equations into a schrodinger - like wave equation analysis .",
    "the regge - wheeler / zerilli formalism was later extended to the case of charged @xcite and rotating @xcite black holes .",
    "a complete description of black hole perturbation theory can be found in the monograph by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "the most interesting stage of the evolution of black hole perturbations is represented by quasinormal modes which can tell us not only if a black hole solution is indeed stable , but also `` how much stable '' it is , i.e , on which timescale a black hole radiate away its `` hair '' after formation .",
    "the prefix `` quasi '' here means that we have an open system that loses energy due to the emission of gravitational waves . in this work",
    ", we shall focus on the issue of quasinormal modes of a loop quantum black hole through axial gravitational perturbations .",
    "the issue of black hole quasinormal modes is interesting not only by the investigation of black hole stability but also because gravitational waves have been pointed as an possible experimental way to make contact with black holes and , in this way , with the quantum spacetime characteristics revealed by them .",
    "indeed , a new breed of gravitational antennas such as lisa , ligo , virgo , and others lead to detect a gravitational signal from black holes , the quasinormal fundamental model will be the predominating contribution to such a signal .",
    "investigation on the quasinormal modes spectrum in the context of lqg has some advantages front others scenarios under the experimental point of view since the quantum corrections present in lqbh scenario depend on the barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite , which , as has been pointed in @xcite , does not suffers with the problem of mass suppression as occurs with the parameters of other quantum gravity theories like superstring theory or noncommutative theory .",
    "moreover , the self - duality property confers to the loop black hole scenario interesting stuff that can contribute in a vital way to the gravitational radiation production specially in the sub - planckian regime .",
    "quasinormal frequencies for lqbh have been addressed for the scalar perturbations case in @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section , we revise the loop quantum black hole theory ; in section , we calculate the regge - wheeler equation for loop quantum black holes ; in section , we calculate the quasinormal modes of the lqbh .",
    "section is devoted to conclusions and remarks . through out this paper , we have used @xmath0 .",
    "loop quantum black holes ( lqbhs ) appeared at the primary time from a simplified model of lqg @xcite . the lqbh framework is delineate by a quantum gravitationally corrected schwarzschild metric , which may be written as    @xmath1    with    @xmath2    where , in the equation , the metric functions are given by    @xmath3    @xmath4    and    @xmath5    where    @xmath6    in this situation , we have got the presence of two horizons - an event horizon localized at @xmath7 and a cauchy horizon localized at @xmath8 .    furthermore , we have that    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the polymeric function given by @xmath11    and @xmath12 is the minimal value of area in loop quantum gravity .    in the metric , r is only asymptotically the same old radial coordinate since @xmath13 is not simply @xmath14 .",
    "a more physical radial coordinate is obtained from the shape of the function @xmath15 within the metric    @xmath16    in the sense that it measures the right circumferential distance .",
    "moreover , the parameter @xmath17 within the solution is related to the adm mass @xmath18 by    @xmath19    the equation reveals vital aspects of the lqbh s internal structure . from this expression , we have got that , as @xmath20 decreases from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , @xmath23 initially decreases from @xmath21 to @xmath24 at @xmath25 so will increase once more to @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 associated with the event horizon is given by    @xmath26    an interesting feature of lqbhs scenario is that related with the self - duality of the metric .",
    "in this case , self - duality means that if one introduces the new coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath28 the metric preserves its type .",
    "the dual radius is given by @xmath29 and corresponds to the smallest possible surface element .",
    "moreover , since the equation may be written as @xmath30 , it is clear that the solution contains another asymptotically flat schwazschild region instead of a singularity within the limit @xmath31 .",
    "this new region corresponds to a planck - sized wormhole .",
    "figure shows the carter - penrose diagram for the lqbh .",
    "in addition , the thermodynamical properties of loop black holes has been addressed in the references @xcite . in particular , within the reference @xcite , the thermodynamical properties of lqbhs were obtained by the employment of a tunneling technique with the introduction of back - reaction effects . by employing the same tunneling method , in the reference @xcite it has been investigated the influence of a generalized uncertainty principle on the thermodynamics of lqbhs .",
    "interestingly , from the form of the lqbhs entropy , it has been found out that these objects could constitute in the building blocks of a holographic version of loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "in this section , we shall use a method due to regge and wheeler to investigate black hole s axial gravitational perturbations @xcite . in this way ,",
    "we have that , if small perturbations are introduced , the resulting spacetime metric can be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the background metric and @xmath34 is the spacetime perturbation , and the perturbations are much smaller than the background . by placing our attention on the perturbation @xmath34 , we have that , due to spherical symmetry , it can be written in two parts , where one depends on the angular coordinates through the spherical harmonics and the another one depends on the coordinates @xmath20 e @xmath35 . moreover , @xmath34 can be written as a sum of a polar and an axial component . in particular , we can find out that the axial component of the gravitational perturbation of the metric , can be written , under the regge - wheeler gauge , as @xcite :    @xmath36\\sin \\theta \\partial_{\\theta}p_l(\\cos \\theta)e^{im\\phi}.\\ ] ]    which applied in the perturbed field equation    @xmath37    give us the following coupled equations :    @xmath38 \\times \\left\\{\\cos \\theta \\frac{\\partial p_l(\\cos \\theta ) } { \\partial \\theta }   \\right .",

    "\\frac{\\partial_l(\\cos \\theta ) } { \\partial \\theta}\\right\\}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to handle the equations above , we can observe that values of multipole indices for which @xmath40 , are not related with dynamics modes , corresponding to conserved quantities . in this way",
    ", we shall consider only the nontrivial radiative multipoles with @xmath41 . on the other hand",
    ", a gravitational perturbation corresponding to @xmath42 will be related with a black hole mass change , and a perturbation corresponding to @xmath43 will be related with a displacement as well as to a change on the black hole angular momentum .",
    "the most interesting multipole indices values are those that correspond to the cases where the wave can propagate during a time interval large enough to be detected . in this way ,",
    "only the @xmath44 cases are relevant @xcite .",

    "[ figsnoop ]    from the equation , we have that the gravitational potential due to the lqbh depends directly from the value of the parameter @xmath61 as well as from the value of the polymeric parameter .",
    "in order to obtain the lqbh quasinormal modes , several methods has been developed . in this section , we shall use a wkb method due to schutz e will @xcite , and improved by iyer e will @xcite . following this method ,",
    "if one supposes that @xmath62 has a harmonic asymptotic behavior in @xmath35 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 as @xmath65 , we obtain the following wave equation :    @xmath66    the quasinormal frequencies are obtained from the relation :    @xmath67-i\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right )   \\left(-2v''_{0}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(1+\\omega \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath68   \\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\alpha^{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{288}\\left(\\frac{v'''_{0}}{v''_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\left(7 + 60\\alpha^{2 }   \\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath69 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath70    by the use of the potential in the relations above , we can found out the quasinormal frequencies for a lqbh , which have been depicted in the tables and for the super - plankian and sub - planckian cases respectively .",
