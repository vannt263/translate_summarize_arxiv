    "the kinetics of irreversible aggregation of particles is one of the most fundamental yet challenging and fascinating problems .",
    "it occurs in a variety of processes in physics , chemistry , biology and engineering .",
    "for instance , aggregation of colloidal or aerosol particles suspended in liquid or gas , polymerization , antigen - antibody aggregation and cluster formation in galaxy etc . are just a few examples to name @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive description of the aggregation process which takes into account the sizes or masses , positions , velocities , geometries and reaction mechanisms of the aggregating particles is a formidable problem and presently beyond the scope of precise theoretical analysis .",
    "the best that can be achieved analytically till to date is to characterize aggregating particles according to their sizes or masses only and describe the process via a kinetic reaction scheme , @xmath0 here , @xmath1 represents an aggregate of size @xmath2 at time @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the rate at which aggregates of size @xmath2 at time @xmath3 joins irreversibly with another particle of size @xmath5 upon encounter and form a new particle of size @xmath6 .    the time - evolution of a system of chemically identical particles which obey the reaction scheme given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction ] ) can be well described by smoluchowski s equation @xcite @xmath7 in this equation , @xmath8 is the concentration of particles of size @xmath2 at time @xmath3 and @xmath9 is the kernel that determines the rate at which particles of size @xmath2 and @xmath5 combine to form a particle of size @xmath6 since the reaction rate is given by @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the factor @xmath11 in the gain term implies that at each step two particles combine to form one particle .",
    "the smoluchowski equation has been studied extensively in and around the eighties for a large class of kernels satisfying @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the homogeneity index .",
    "significant contributions towards the understanding of the scaling theory and sol - gel phase transitions have been made during this period @xcite .",
    "much of the recent theoretical work on aggregation has been devoted to making the smoluchowski equation more versatile .",
    "this is mainly driven by the thirst of gaining deeper insight into the systems beyond the scope of the smoluchowski equation .",
    "for instance , krapivsky and ben - naim proposed a model that involves aggregation of two types of particles , active and passive , in an attempt to explain multi - phase coarsening processes and polymerization of linear polymers @xcite .",
    "et al . _ proposed yet another aggregation model with monomer replications and/or self - replications intended to explain processes such as dna replication @xcite .",
    "besides , hassan and hassan recently proposed a model that considers aggregation of particles growing by heterogeneous condensation and shown that the resulting system emerges as fractal which is accompanied by the violation of conservation of mass @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this has been the only analytcal work that found fractal in aggregation process albeit there exist numerous laboratory experiments and numerical simulations which suggested that scale - invariant fractals almost always emerge when particles aggregate @xcite .",
    "we need more exactly solvable analytical models to elucidate and explain why fractals are so ubiquitous in aggregation processes .",
    "the present work therefore can be seen as yet another attempt to that end .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a very simple variant of the smoluchowski equation in which we investigate aggregation of particles accompanied by self - replication of the newly formed particles with a given probability @xmath15 .",
    "the spirit of our model , in some senses , is similar to that of the work of ke _ et al .",
    "in contrast to their work where self - replication is facilitated by a rate kernel , in our case self - replication is facilitated by a prior choice of the probability @xmath15 . besides",
    ", we may consider that the system of our model has two different kinds of particles : active and passive .",
    "as the systems evolves , active particles always remain active and take part in aggregation while the character of the passive particles are altered irreversibly to an active particle with probability @xmath15 .",
    "once a passive particle turns into an active particle it can take part in further aggregation like other active particles already present in the system on an equal footing and never turns into a passive particle .",
    "this interpretation is very similar to the work of krapivsky and ben - naim @xcite . while in their work the character of an active particle",
    "is altered , in our work it is the other way around .",
    "the two models are different also because here we only consider the dynamics of the active particles , whereas krapivsky and ben - naim studied the dynamics of both the entities since a passive particle in their case exist at the expense of an active particle and therefore a consistency check is required",
    ". however , the present model does not require such consistency check .",
    "there are many real physical systems where both aggregation and self - replication occur naturally . for instance , the symbiosis - driven growth of biological systems , the replication - driven amplification of cells and dna replication in polymerase chain reactions @xcite .",
    "the model we propose can also describe systems where passive clusters coexist with active cluster without disturbing the dynamics of the latter .",
    "for instance , in polymerization of linear polymers the system may contain chemically active as well as initially inert ( or passive ) polymers of poly - disperse distribution of sizes .",
    "active and passive clusters can also co - exist in multiphase coarsening processes in one dimension whereby upon merging the domain walls may remain active or become passive depending on the surface tension of the phase of the neighboring domains .",
    "besides its potential application in various physical processes , it is also interesting from the pedagogical point of view as it is an exactly solvable analytical model that can interpolate between stochastic fractal with tunable fractal dimensions for @xmath16 and euclidean dimensions for @xmath17 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , we present the definition of our model and the generalized smoluchowski equation that can describe the model . in section iii , we give an exact solution to the generalized smoluchowski equation valid for all time @xmath3 .",
    "the scaling theory of the smoluchowski equation we propose is discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v , we invoke the idea of fractal analysis to give a geometric interpretation of our model . finally , in section vi we give a general discussion and summary of the work .",
    "perhaps an exact algorithm can provide a better description of the model than its mere definition .",
    "the process starts with a system that comprise of a large number of chemically identical brownian particles and a fixed value for the probability @xmath18 $ ] by which particles are self - replicated .",
    "the alogorithm of the model can then be described as follows :    * two particles , say of sizes @xmath2 and @xmath5 , are picked randomly from the system to mimic a random collision via brownian motion . *",
    "add the sizes of the two particles to form one particle of their combined size @xmath6 to mimic aggregation .",
    "* pick a random number @xmath19 . if @xmath20 then add another particle of size @xmath6 to the system to mimic self - replication . * the steps ( i)-(iii )",
    "are repeated _ ad infinitum _ to mimic the time evolution .",
    "note that random collision due to brownian motion can be ensured if we choose a constant kernel @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath21 for convenience .",
    "the smoluchowski equation with constant kernel then corresponds to the @xmath17 case . on the other hand",
    ", the other extreme @xmath22 case describes the fact that whenever two particles , say of size @xmath2 and @xmath5 , come into contact they form a particle of their combined size @xmath6 and at the same time a particle of size @xmath6 is replicated .",
    "that is , in this case two particles always becomes two and hence the factor @xmath11 in the gain term of the smoluchowski equation has to be replaced by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "we now consider the case where this latter process occurs with some probability @xmath18 $ ] and aggregation without replication occurs with probability @xmath24 .",
    "combining the two processes we can immediately write the following generalized smoluchowski equation @xmath25 this is the fitting equation to the model described by the algorithm @xmath26 and the reaction scheme @xmath27",

    "recall that the numerical value of a dimensionless quantity always remains unchanged upon transition from one unit of measurement to another within a given class . in the context of the present model it implies that the numerical value of @xmath185 remains the same despite the fact that the system size continues to grow with time .    in summary , besides solving the model analytically , we performed extensive numerical simulation which fully support all theoretical findings .",
    "especially , the conditions under which scaling and fractals emerge are found , the fractal dimension of the system is given and the relationship between this fractal dimension and a conserved quantity pointed out .",
    "our findings complement the results found in the condensation - driven aggregation indicating that these results are ubiquitous in the aggregation processes where mass conservation is violated .",
    "we hope this work will provide useful insights and theoretical predictions for aggregation processes in physical , chemical and biological systems with self - replications",
    ". it would be instructive to analyze our model with other reaction rates such as sum kernel @xmath186 and product kernel @xmath187 . in the case where @xmath187",
    ", we expect the stochastic self - replication mechanism to affect the sol - gel phase transition time .",
    "we propose to investigate these issues in subsequent work and hope that the present work will attract a renewed interest in the subject of aggregation .",
