    "recent progresses in experiments with polar molecules and magnetic atoms opens interesting prospects to study many - body effects in quantum degenerate gases where the dominant interactions are provided by anisotropic , long - range dipolar forces @xcite . in the case of fermionic particles , the quest for ultracold polar molecules in their rovibrational ground state",
    "is actively pursued using mixtures of @xmath1k@xmath2rb @xcite , @xmath3na@xmath1k @xcite , @xmath3na@xmath4li @xcite and @xmath5cs@xmath4li @xcite .",
    "the electric dipole moment of these heteronuclear molecules ranges from 0.56 @xmath6 for @xmath1k@xmath2rb to 5.5 d in the case of @xmath5cs@xmath4li .",
    "another possibility to realize a dipolar fermi gas is to bring highly magnetic atoms , with magnetic moments on the order of ten bohr magnetons , to the regime of quantum degeneracy , as it has been successfully achieved with dy  @xcite and er  @xcite atoms .",
    "two dimensional ( 2d ) geometries , in the form of a single layer or of a multilayer structure , prove to be very useful for producing ultracold gas systems with strong dipolar interactions either because they help suppress unwanted chemical reactions  @xcite or , more generally , they can prevent the many - body collapse driven by the head - to - tail dipolar attractive force .",
    "we consider a bilayer system of dipolar fermions where the particles occupy two parallel planes separated by a distance @xmath0 and the dipole moments are aligned perpendicular to the planes by a sufficiently strong external field .",
    "tunneling between the planes is assumed to be negligible and the motion of the particles in each plane is assumed to be strictly 2d .",
    "pairing arises from the attractive component of the interlayer dipolar interaction : two particles belonging to different layers always form a bound state for any separation distance @xmath0  @xcite , while many - body systems with equal in - plane densities are expected to exhibit superfluid behavior at sufficiently low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "a crossover from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) type of superfluid state is also expected as a function of the interlayer distance , depending on whether the two - body binding energy is smaller or larger than the in - plane fermi energy .",
    "a qualitative description of this crossover is provided by the bcs theory applied to 2d fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "the bilayer system of fermionic dipoles considered in the present article shows a novel type of bcs - bec crossover similar to the one studied in two component fermi gases where contact interactions are tuned by a magnetic field in the vicinity of a fano - feschbach resonance ( for a review see refs .",
    "a new ingredient here is the long - range nature of the dipolar interaction and the in - plane repulsion felt by the particles .",
    "these latter features establish also strong analogies with the electron - hole bilayer in semiconductor heterostructures and graphene , which attracted a lot of interest in the last years  @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies were performed in the mean - field approximation  @xcite . here",
    "we report on calculations of the equation of state and of the superfluid gap at zero temperature using the fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( fn - dmc ) technique .",
    "the in - plane density corresponds to the weakly - interacting regime of a single - layer fermi liquid  @xcite . for balanced populations in the two layers",
    "we calculate the ground - state energy of the system and , from the dependence of this energy on a slight population unbalance , we determine the chemical potential and the pairing gap . by decreasing the interlayer separation @xmath0",
    "the ground - state energy varies from the value corresponding to a single fermionic layer  @xcite to the one of a single layer of composite bosonic dipoles with twice the mass and twice the dipole moment . in the same crossover , the pairing gap increases from the exponentially small bcs result to half of the large two - body binding energy in the bec regime of small separation .",
    "we compare our results with the simplest mean - field approach valid in the low - density limit and we find important deviations once the contribution from the two - body physics is subtracted from the energy per particle and the pairing gap . the role played by in - plane repulsions",
    "is also found to be relevant in the discussion of the schematic phase diagram of the system in the interlayer / intralayer interaction plane , where the bcs and bec regimes of the superfluid compete with the wigner crystal phase reached at large densities .",

    "iii contains a review of the results of the mean - field approach , which qualitatively describes the crossover in terms of the two - body binding energy . in sec .",
    "iv we present the fn - dmc results for the ground - state energy and we discuss the phase diagram of the system as a function of interlayer separation and in - plane interaction strength . in sec .",
    "v the technique to calculate the chemical potential , the pairing gap and the quasiparticle spectrum is explained and the results are discussed and compared with mean - field predictions . finally , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider a bilayer system of identical fermionic dipoles where bottom and top layers contain , respectively , @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles , @xmath9 being the total number of fermions .",
    "the layers are strictly 2d planes separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that all dipoles are aligned perpendicular to the plane of motion by an external field and , also , that tunneling between layers can be neglected .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system is written as @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the mass of the particles , @xmath12 is the dipole moment , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote , respectively , the in - plane interparticle distance in the bottom layer between the @xmath15-th and the @xmath16-th particle and in the top layer between the @xmath17-th and the @xmath18-th particle .",

[ fig1 ] ) .",

    "fn - dmc simulations provide a rigorous upper bound to the ground - state energy depending on the choice of the nodal surface of the trial wave function , _",

    "we also notice that the value of the parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath53 present in the many - body wave function ( [ psia ] ) modify the nodal surface and therefore require an optimization procedure using the fn - dmc algorithm .",

    "the nodal surface of the trial wave function coincides with the one of an ideal fermi gas and , being incompatible with off - diagonal long - range order in the two - body density matrix  @xcite , properly describes normal fermi liquids .",
    "this choice of the trial wave function is expected to be valid in the deep bcs regime , where the effects of pairing on the ground - state energy are negligible .",
    "the parametrization ( [ phi ] ) of the pair orbital allows one to interpolate continuously between these two regimes  @xcite .",
    "as it is known from bcs theory @xcite , in two dimensions the presence of a two - body bound state in vacuum is a necessary and sufficient condition for s - wave pairing with an arbitrary interaction potential .",
