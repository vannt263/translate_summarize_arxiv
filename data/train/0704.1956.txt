    "double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) processes are expected to extend the physics program at the lhc not only due to the possible higgs boson detection but also because of the possibility to study broader range of qcd physics and diffraction @xcite .",
    "the processes are theoreticaly characterized by large rapidity gap regions devoid of particles between centrally produced heavy object and the scattered hadrons which leave the interaction intact .",
    "this is attributed to the exchange of a colorless object , the pomeron ( or the reggeon ) . in the lhc environment , however , the rapidity gap signature will not appear because of the high number of multiple interactions occuring at the same time , and the diffractive events will be identified tagging the escaping protons in the beam pipe .",
    "one generally considers two classes of dpe processes , namely , _",
    "exclusive _ dpe events if the central object is produced alone carrying away the total available diffractive energy and _ inclusive _ events when the total energy is used to produce the central object and in addition the pomeron remnants .",
    "exclusive events allow a precise reconstruction of the mass and kinematical properties of the central object using the central detector or even more precisely using very forward detectors installed far downstream from the interaction point .",
    "the most appealing exclusive process to be studied at the lhc is the higgs boson production but since it can not be observed at the tevatron due to the low production cross section , one should find other ways to look for exclusive events at the tevatron , for example in dijet , diphoton channels .",
    "it is needed to mention that until recently , there was not a decisive measurement that would provide enough evidence for the existence of exclusive production .",
    "although exclusive production yields kinematically well constrained final state objects , their experimental detection is non - trivial due to the overlap with the _ inclusive _ dpe events . in those events ,",
    "the colliding pomerons are usualy viewed as an object with partonic sub - structure .",
    "a parton emitted from the pomeron takes part in the hard interaction and pomeron remnants accompanying the central object are distributed uniformly in rapidity .",
    "exclusive events usually appear as a small deviation from the inclusive model predictions which need to be studied precisely before accepting a new kind of production .",
    "in particular , the structure of the pomeron as obtained from hera is not precisely known at high momentum fraction , and specifically , the gluon in the pomeron is not well constrained .",
    "it is not clear if such uncertainty could not lead to mis - identifying observed processes as exclusive .",
    "this would for instance preclude the spin analysis of the produced object .    in this paper , we aim to investigate the observation of exclusive production at the tevatron .",
    "indeed , we use the dijet mass fraction distribution measured by the cdf collaboration and show that even taking into account uncertainties associated with the pomeron structure , one is unable to give a satisfactory description of the data without the existence of exclusive events .",
    "we also include other approach to explain diffraction in our study , the so called soft color interaction model ( the properties of all the models are discussed later ) . as an outlook",
    ", we apply current models for the dpe production for lhc energies and demonstrate the possible appereance of exclusive events through the dijet mass fraction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section we give a brief description of the inclusive , exclusive , and soft color interaction models .",
    "the third section discusses how well the various models can explain the preliminary tevatron dijet mass fraction data and the constraints implied by data on the current models . in the fourth part",
    ", we foreshadow an application of the dijet mass fraction distribution as a tool to observe exclusive events at lhc energies .",
    "finally , we discuss issues concerning the dijet mass fraction reconstruction and fast detector simulation in the appendix .",
    "inclusive and exclusive dpe models used in this paper are implemented in the monte carlo program dpemc @xcite .",
    "the soft color interaction model is embeded in the pythia program @xcite .",
    "the survey of the different models follows .",
    "the first inclusive model to be mentioned is the so called  factorized model \" .",
    "it is an ingelman - schlein type of model @xcite describing the diffractive double pomeron process as a scattering of two pomerons emitted from the proton , assuming a factorization of the cross section into a regge flux convoluted with the pomeron structure functions . for @xmath0 single diffraction ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce secondary reggeon trajectory to describe the observed single diffractive non - factorable cross section . in the case of the tevatron ,",
    "the pomeron trajectory alone is sufficient to describe present data and the cross section is factorable as it was advocated in @xcite .",
    "factorization breaking between hera and tevatron comes only through the survival probability factor , denoting the probability that there is no additional soft interaction which would destroy the diffractively scattered protons . in other word",
    ", the probability to destroy the rapidity gap does not depend on the hard interaction . at tevatron energies ,",
    "the factor was measured to be approximately 0.1 , and calculation suggested the value of 0.03 for the lhc .",
    "pomeron structure functions , reggeon and pomeron fluxes are determined from the dis @xmath0 collisions fitting the diffractive structure function @xmath1 at hera . for one of the most recent published diffractive structure function analysis",
    "see e.g @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the bialas - landshoff ( bl ) inclusive model @xcite , is a purely non - perturbative calculation utilising only the shape of the pomeron structure function and leaving the overall normalization to be determined from the experiment ; one can for example confront the prediction of dpe cross section with the observed rate at the tevatron @xcite and obtain the missing normalization factor .",
    ", where the @xmath2 are the true parton densities as measured by the hera collaboration , and @xmath3 denotes the momentum fraction of the parton @xmath4 in the pomeron .",
    "the integral of @xmath5 is normalized to 1 , so that in the limit @xmath6 the exclusive cross section is recovered @xcite . ]",
    "both models use the pomeron structure measured at hera which is gluon dominated . in this paper",
    ", we use the results of the qcd fits to the most recent pomeron structure function data measured by the h1 collaboration @xcite . the new gluon density in the pomeron is found to be slightly smaller than the previous ones , and it is interesting to see the effect of the new pdfs with respect to the tevatron measurements .",
    "however , the gluon density at high @xmath7 , where @xmath7 denotes the fraction of the particular parton in the pomeron , is not well constrained from the qcd fits performed at hera . to study this uncertainty , we multiply the gluon distribution by the factor @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "qcd fits to the h1 data lead to the uncertainty on the @xmath9 parameter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we will see in the following how this parameter influences the results on dijet mass fraction as measured at the tevatron .",
    "bialas - landsoff exclusive model @xcite is based on an exchange of two  non - perturbative \" gluons between a pair of colliding hadrons which connect to the hard subprocess .",
    "reggeization is employed in order to recover the pomeron parameters which successfully described soft diffractive phenomena , e.g. total cross section at low energies .",
    "a calculation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 production and more details can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    on the contrary ,",
    "the khoze , martin , ryskin ( kmr ) @xcite model is purely a perturbative approach .",
    "the interaction is obtained by an exchange of two gluons directly coupled to the colliding hadrons ( no pomeron picture is introduced ) . while one gluon takes part in the creation of the central object , the other serves to screen the color flow across the rapidity gap . if the outgoing protons remain intact and scatter at small angles , the exchanged di - gluon system , in both models , must obey the selection rules @xmath13 , c - even , p - even . such constrains are also applied to the hard subprocesses for the production of the central object .",
    "the two models show a completely different @xmath14 dependence of the dpe cross section . the energy dependence of the bl model is found to be weaker since the pomeron is assumed to be soft whereas it is not the case for the kmr model .",
    "the soft color interaction model ( sci ) @xcite assumes that diffraction is not due to a colorless exchange at the hard vertex but rather to a string rearrangement in the final state during hadronisation .",
    "this model gives a probability ( to be determined by the experiment ) that there is no string connection , and so no color exchange , between the partons in the proton and the scattered quark produced during the hard interaction .",
    "since the model does not imply the existence of a pomeron , there is no need of a concept like survival probability and a correct normalisation is found between single diffraction tevatron and hera data without any new parameter , which is one of the big successes of this model .",
    "( here @xmath15 ) .",
    "the gluon density is multiplied by the factor @xmath16 where @xmath9=-1 . , -0.5 , 0.5 , 1 .",
    "the default value @xmath17 is the gluon density in the pomeron determined directly by a fit to the h1 @xmath18 data with an uncertainty of about 0.5 . ]",
    "dijet mass fraction ( dmf ) turns out to be a very appropriate observable for identifying the exclusive production .",
    "it is defined as a ratio @xmath19 of the dijet system invariant mass @xmath20 to the total mass of the final state system @xmath21 ( excluding the intact beam ( anti)protons ) .",
    "if the jet algorithm has such properties that the outside - cone effects are small , the presence of an exclusive production would manifest itself as an excess of the events towards @xmath22 ; for exclusive events , the dijet mass is essentially equal to the mass of the central system because no pomeron remnant is present .",
    "the advantage of dmf is that one can focus on the shape of the distribution ; the observation of exclusive events does not rely on the overall normalization which might be strongly dependent on the detector simulation and acceptance of the roman pot detector .    in the following analysis , we closely follow the measurement performed by the cdf collaboration .",
    "one can find more information about the measurement and the detector setup in a note discussing preliminary results @xcite . in this paragraph",
    ", we will mention only the different cuts which are relevant for our analysis . to simulate the cdf detector",
    ", we use a fast simulation interface @xcite , which performs a smearing of the deposited cell energy above a @xmath23 threshold and reconstructs jets using a cone algorithm .",
    "properties of the event such as the rapidity gap size were evaluated at the generator particle level .",
    "cdf uses a roman pot detector to tag the antiprotons on one side ( corresponding to @xmath24 ) . for the dmf reconstruction ,",
    "we require the antiprotons to have the longitudinal momentum loss in the range @xmath25 and we apply the roman pot acceptance obtained from the cdf collaboration ( the real acceptance is greater than 0.5 for @xmath26 ) . on the proton side , where no such device is present ,",
    "a rapidity gap of the size @xmath27 is required . in the analysis ,",
    "further cuts are applied : two leading jets with a transverse momentum above the threshold @xmath28 or @xmath29 in the central region @xmath30 , a third jet veto cut ( @xmath31 ) as well as an additional gap on the antiproton side of the size @xmath32 . for the sake of brevity , the threshold for the transverse momentum of the two leading jets will be in the following denoted as @xmath33 , if needed .",
    "the dijet mass is computed using the jet momenta for all events passing the above mentioned cuts . in order to follow as much as possible the method used by the cdf collaboration ,",
    "the mass of the diffractive system @xmath21 is calculated from the longitudinal antiproton momentum loss @xmath34 within the roman pot acceptance , and the longitudinal momentum loss of the proton @xmath35 is determined from the particles in the central detector ( @xmath36 ) , such that : @xmath37 summing over the particles with energies higher than @xmath23 in the final state at generator level . to reconstruct the diffractive mass , @xmath38",

    "the exclusive contribution manifests itself as an increase in the tail of the distribution which can be seen for @xmath80 jets ( left ) and @xmath81 jets ( right ) , respectively in fig .",
    "[ figdmfexclhc ] .",
    "exclusive production slowly turns on with the increase of the jet @xmath14 which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figndpeptlhc ] where the number of expected dpe events is shown .",
    "however , with respect to the uncertainty on the gluon density this appearance is almost negligiable .",
    "one can use the average position of the dmf as a function of the minimal jet transverse momentum @xmath33 to study the presence of the exclusive contribution , see fig .",
    "[ figmeanlhc ] .",
    "this is true especially for high @xmath14 jets .",
    "the exclusive production at the lhc plays a minor role for low @xmath14 jets .",
    "therefore , measurements e.g for @xmath82 where the inclusive production is dominant could be used to constrain the gluon density in the pomeron .",
    "afterwards , one can look in the high @xmath14 jet region to extract the exclusive contribution from the tail of the dmf .",
    "the aim of this paper was to investigate whether we can explain the excess of events at the high dijet mass fraction measured at the tevatron without the exclusive production .",
    "the result is actually two fold .    concerning the pomeron induced models ( `` factorized model '' and bialas - landshoff inclusive models ) we found that the uncertainty on the high @xmath7 gluon density in the pomeron has a small impact at high @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , an additional contribution is needed to describe the cdf data with these models .",
    "we examined the exclusive kmr model and bialas - landshoff exclusive model predictions for the role of the additional contribution and found that the best descriprion of data is achieved by the combination of the factorized inclusive model ( or the modified inclusive bialas - landshoff one ) and the kmr exclusive model .",
    "the exclusive contribution at the tevatron can be magnified requesting higher @xmath14 jets and studying specific observables like a mean of the dijet mass fraction , for example .",
    "though , one of the limitations of using high @xmath14 jets is due to the rate of dpe events which falls logarithmicaly allowing measurements for jets up to approximately @xmath83 .",
    "the bialas - landshoff exclusive model seems to be disfavoured by tevatron data since it shows a softer jet @xmath14 dependance and predicts unphysically large dpe rates at lhc energies .    in the case of the soft color interaction model which is not based on pomeron exchanges , the need to introduce an additional exclusive production is less obvious . for low @xmath14 jets",
    "the amount of exclusive events to describe the data is smaller than in case of factorized model , but for high @xmath14 jets no additional contribution is necessary .",
    "this draws a new question : whether the double pomeron exchange events could be explained by a special rearrangement of color only ?",
    "the cdf data are in this model dominated by single diffractive events .",
    "the probability of tagging two protons in the final state within this model is very small , contradicting the cdf observation .",
    "so even though the sci model is not applicable for dpe events in the current state it would be worth adjusting this model to correctly predict the rate of double tagged events and study the model prediction of dijet mass fraction and other dpe induced processes .",
    "dijet mass fraction at the lhc could be used to select the exclusive events .",
    "indeed , it is possible to study jets with @xmath84 for instance , and to focus on events with dmf above 0.8 which is dominated by exclusive production ( see fig .",
    "[ figdmfexclhc ] ) .",
    "however , as it was advocated earlier , a complete qcd analysis consisting of measuring the gluon density in the pomeron ( especially at high @xmath7 ) and study the qcd evolution of exclusive events as a function of jet @xmath14 is needed to fully understand the observables , and make predictions for diffractive higgs production and its background at the lhc as an example .",
    "the authors want to thank m. boonekamp , r. enberg , d. goulianos , g. ingelman , r. pechanski and k. tereashi for useful discussions and for providing them the cdf data and roman pot acceptance .",
    "throughout the paper , we have purpously omitted a discussion of imperfections concerning the dijet mass fraction reconstruction within our framework , postponing it to this section . in this appendix ,",
    "all calculations are done for jets with @xmath42 .    * in our analysis , we define the dijet mass fraction as a ratio of the two leading jet invariant mass @xmath20 to the central diffractive mass @xmath21 .",
    "the latter was determined using the momentum loss @xmath34 measured in a roman pot on the antiproton side and the @xmath38 obtained from particles on the generator level , such as @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", we must ensure that all of the produced diffractive energy @xmath21 is deposited into the central detector .",
    "if this is not the case , our @xmath21 at generator level might be sensibly larger than the one measured by the cdf collaboration .",
    "the energy flow of the particles on the generator level as a function of rapidity is shown in fig .",
    "[ figenergy ] , upper plot .",
    "the middle plot shows the energy flow weighted by the transverse momentum of the particle @xmath86 .",
    "we see that most of the energy is deposited in the calorimeter region , i.e. for @xmath87 . in @xmath69 tagged events , protons most frequently loose a smaller momentum fraction ( roughly @xmath88 ) than the tagged antiproton for which the acceptance turns on for @xmath89 .",
