    "[ sec : intro ]    the first important step in the description of a conformal field theory ( cft ) is represented by the identification of the primary operators and the knowledge of their conformal dimension . the second crucial characterisation of a cft is given by the structure constants which determine the operator product expansion ( ope ) between two primary operators . @xmath0",
    "super yang - mills ( sym ) theory is an important example of interacting four dimensional cft which has been thoroughly studied because of the ads / cft duality with string theory  @xcite . in particular in the recent years huge progress has been made in the computation of the planar contribution to the conformal dimensions of non - protected operators .",
    "comparatively very little is known about the structure constants . in principle",
    "it is possible to tackle this problem by using both the gauge and string theory descriptions . in the first case",
    "the structure constants are extracted from the 3-point correlators among gauge invariant operators , while in the second description one needs to compute the partition function of iib string theory in ads@xmath2 with appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately neither of these approaches can be currently used to explicitly evaluate the structure constants as an exact function of t  hooft coupling ( @xmath4 ) even in the planar limit .    our current knowledge of the ope coefficients",
    "is essentially based on a perturbative expansion around @xmath5 , where standard feynman diagrams can be used to evaluate the relevant gauge theory correlators , or around @xmath6 where the iib string theory is well approximated by a simpler description . by comparing the 3-point correlators among half - bps operators in these two different limits , the authors of  @xcite conjectured that the corresponding structure constants are non - renormalised ( i.e. they have a trivial dependence on the t  hooft coupling ) . on the contrary",
    "the 3-point correlators among non - protected operators receive quantum corrections , as it is shown , for instance , by the correlator between three konishi operators  @xcite . on the gauge theory side",
    ", the authors of  @xcite studied systematically the structure constants for operators with only bosonic fields and computed the corrections arising from the planar 1-loop feynman diagrams . on the string theory side",
    "it is more difficult to extract information about non - protected ope coefficients , since , in the supergravity limit , all non - protected operators acquire large conformal dimension and decouple .",
    "the bmn limit  @xcite represents a different approximation , where it is possible to extract useful information on non - bps structure constants . in this framework",
    "the cubic hamiltonian has been studied thoroughly  @xcite and in  @xcite it was proposed how to combine these results and relate the pp - wave cubic hamiltonian to the structure constants of the @xmath0 sym .",
    "in computing explicit examples of non - protected structure constant , one encounters a complication that is common to both the gauge and the string theory language : the knowledge of the conformal dimension of the operators is not sufficient , but one needs also their precise form in terms of the elementary degrees of freedom . in other words , it is necessary to know both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the @xmath0 sym dilatation operator .",
    "this point has been discussed explicitly in the gauge theory analysis of correlators that receive contributions from extremal diagrams  @xcite .",
    "these 3-point correlators receive corrections at the leading order in @xmath7 from the mixing between single and double trace operators , even if this mixing is irrelevant for the computation of the conformal dimensions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show in explicit examples that another type of operator mixing , controlled by @xmath4 , plays a crucial role in the computation of the structure constants in both descriptions ( and clearly on the gauge theory side it is relevant also for the correlators that do not have any extremal contribution ) . in particular we will focus on the operators in the non - bps multiplet discussed in  @xcite which represents a generalisation of the usual konishi multiplet .",
    "the mixing problem for these operators was discussed in  @xcite by studying the action of the conformal supercharges . in the examples discussed in sections  [ sec : correlators ] and",
    "[ non - zero ] of this paper , one can see that the corrections due to the operator mixing just mentioned play a crucial role in the computation of the structure constants .    in our analysis we will pay particular attention to the 3-point correlators involving two half - bps states and one non - bps state .",
    "this class of correlators enjoys a special status and various results have been derived or conjectured by studying carefully the symmetries of the theory .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite it was proposed that the @xmath1 bonus symmetry should constrain the result of certain @xmath0 correlators .",
    "this @xmath1 is an exact symmetry of the theory only at the level of the equations of motion of the free theory @xmath8 and in the supergravity limit @xmath9 . for finite values of the coupling ,",
    "the symmetry is broken by the yukawa coupling in the gauge theory language or by the string corrections on the bulk side .",
    "however , it is still possible to attach a @xmath1 quantum number to the various states of the theory by assigning charge @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) the supercharges transforming in the fundamental ( anti - fundamental ) representation of the global symmetry group @xmath12 .",
    "then if the highest weight states have @xmath1 charge zero , as in our example , we can read the charge of all descendants by looking at what level in the supermultiplet they are . in  @xcite ,",
    "it was conjectured that 3-point correlators involving two half - bps states and one non - bps state should obey a selection rule and only the amplitudes that preserve the @xmath1 charge are expected to be non - trivial ( on the contrary , when two or more non - bps operators are present , there is no @xmath1 selection rule at work ) . the evidence provided in  @xcite for this conjecture includes both gauge theory perturbative computations and arguments on instanton corrections .",
    "other results on this class of correlators were derived by studying the ope of 4-point correlators among half bps states  @xcite .",
    "for instance , this analysis shows that the ope of two protected operators with @xmath12 dynkin labels @xmath13 $ ] can generate only the non - bps states that belong to multiplets whose highest weight state has labels @xmath14 $ ] with @xmath15 .",
    "finally the strongest results on this class of correlators are derived by using the @xmath0 superspace which can make manifest the constraints of the superconformal ward identities on the correlators ( see in particular the results of  @xcite ) .",
    "this formalism implies that the 3-point correlators involving two protected operators and a non - protected one are completely determined by the structure constants of the highest weight states of each multiplet . from this point of view",
    ", the conjecture on the @xmath1 selection rule of  @xcite just follows from the form of the possible superspace invariants .",
    "our results show that , in explicit perturbative gauge theory computations , all the constraints mentioned above are fulfilled only after taking into account the solution of the mixing problem discussed in  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the cancellation occurring in the possibly @xmath1 violating 3-point correlators with one non - bps and two half - bps states are less trivial than suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the leading order quantum corrections from the feynman diagrams with the insertion of one yukawa coupling do not vanish for symmetry reason because of the presence of the `` phase '' factor in the definition of the non - bps state .",
    "however , we show that this contribution is precisely canceled by new contributions coming from the mixing discussed in  @xcite . in other words the mixing coefficients determined by checking that the non - bps state has",
    "the expected superconformal transformations ensure the cancellation of the correlators that would violate the @xmath1 selection rule ! this shows the necessity of using the correct form of the operators even for those special correlators that are expected to vanish because of some symmetry arguments .",
    "of course the same operators should be used to compute the structure constants that are not constrained by symmetries and we show in one example that the mixing discussed in  @xcite contributes in a non - trivial way to the final result .",
    "we expect that a similar contribution is present also at order @xmath16 for the correlators ( with the singlet and antisymmetric operators ) computed in  @xcite .",
    "of course , it is very interesting to study the interaction between one non - bps and two bps states on the string side of the ads / cft correspondence and see whether the constraints discussed above are satisfied also in the string description .",
    "as already mentioned , currently the only concrete way to perform this type of test at strong coupling is to focus on the bmn limit .",
    "for instance , the cubic hamiltonian does preserve the @xmath1 charge in the interaction among three supergravity states  @xcite . here",
    "we discuss some interactions involving two supergravity and one string states .",
    "again the mixing discussed in  @xcite plays a crucial role and provides necessary terms to cancel contributions that are prohibited by the superconformal ward identities or by the @xmath1 selection rule .",
    "however , we will see specific examples of 3-string amplitudes where these cancellations are not complete and some unwanted terms survive .",
    "thus the bmn 3-string vertex does not seem to satisfy completely all the constraints that we checked at the level of perturbative gauge theory .",
    "another possible way to test the @xmath1 selection rule at strong coupling is to study the string corrections to the ads amplitudes with four bps state . since in the intermediate channel",
    "all non - bps states are exchanged , a @xmath1 violating amplitude of this type implies the existence of 3-point correlators that do not satisfy the conjectured selection rule . at the best of our knowledge",
    "this kind of checks have not been performed yet in the literature and we will not discuss any explicit example in this paper .",
    "however , recent results on the iib string effective action  @xcite provide some of the necessary ingredients for the computation of the string corrections to the supergravity amplitudes . also in this case , it is not clear that the selection rules  @xcite are preserved away from the strict supergravity limit since the action obtained in  @xcite contains at least one @xmath1 violating term .",
    "certainly further analysis is necessary to see whether it is possible to modify or interpret the string results discussed in this paper in a way that is compatible with all the constraints that are so well supported by the perturbative gauge theory analysis .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : operators ] we discuss the structure of the bmn - like multiplet with two impurities . by using the method introduced in @xcite we resolve the operator mixing for the primary state up to order @xmath17",
    ". then we derive the form of the level three and level four descendants that we will need in the calculation of the three point correlators of the following sections . in section  [ sec : correlators ] we illustrate the importance of the subleading terms of the aforementioned states by focusing on some correlators which are bound to be zero either by the supersymmetric ward identities and/or by the @xmath1 conservation rule .",
    "were these terms not present in the states one would get a non - zero result for these three - point functions .",
    "the resolution of the mixing up to order @xmath17 allows one to calculate the complete order @xmath4 structure constants for any three - point function involving non - bps states with two impurities . in section  [ non - zero ]",
    "we consider an example of a non - trivial three - point function between the primary state and two bps operators in which the structure coefficient receives a @xmath17 contribution originating from the subleading term of the primary which has vector impurities . in section  [ sec : string ] , we discuss some example of 3-string amplitudes in the pp - wave limit of the @xmath18 type iib string theory .",
    "firstly , we discuss the form of the string states dual to the operators of the long multiplet introduced in section  [ sec : operators ] .",
    "then , we consider the string amplitudes involving two bps and one string state and evaluate the pp - wave cubic hamiltonian in some explicit examples .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we comment on these results and discuss their connection to other recent developments in the literature .",
    "[ sec : operators ]    gauge invariant operators in @xmath3 sym are classified according to the representation of the superconformal group @xmath19 they belong to .",
    "each representation consists in a multiplet which is generated by the action of the supersymmetry ( susy ) and conformal charges on a primary operator . for bps representations some of the ( non - conformal ) supersymmetry charges vanish when they act on the superconformal primary .",
    "the half bps highest weight states ( hws ) @xmath20 are the operators of free conformal dimension @xmath21 transforming in the @xmath22 $ ] representation of the @xmath23 @xmath24-symmetry group .",

    ", we need first to fix the form of the string state corresponding to the operator  . as before , this is done by checking that the string state is annihilated by the same supercharges of the gauge theory operator and the result is @xmath230    |\\alpha\\rangle,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as a warming up exercise , we computed the amplitude describing the splitting of the non - bps state   into two strings in the ground state ( which is annihilated by all destruction operators @xmath231 ) .",
    "again the contributions of the terms with bosonic and fermionic impurities in   are non - trivial . after using the properties of the constituents in @xmath222 , it is possible to check that these two contributions are one the opposite of the other .",
    "so the cubic hamiltonian is again zero for this @xmath1 violating process .",
    "we did not consider explicitly this example on the gauge theory side , because the corresponding correlator receives contributions from some extremal diagrams and so , in order to have a reliable result for the structure constants , one would need to resolve also the @xmath232 mixing with double trace operators .",
    "now we can turn to the string amplitude that really corresponds to the correlator  .",
    "it is described by the splitting of the state   into two bps states with two bosonic impurities each @xmath233 there are two kinds of contributions for this process .",
    "the first possibility is to contract the impurities in   with @xmath222 in such a way that there is no mixing with the oscillators in the non - bps state .",
    "these contributions will cancel as in the previous example . secondly , there are the contributions where the oscillators of the bps and the non - bps states are mixed together non - trivially . in the string analysis",
    "they can involve only the oscillators with indices in the `` flavour '' @xmath234 , _",
    "i.e _ the oscillator that in the standard bmn dictionary between string and gauge theory impurities correspond to the insertion of scalar fields .",
    "the result for this case is @xmath235 apparently the cubic hamiltonian discussed in  @xcite does not have room for a contribution corresponding to the field theory diagrams in fig .  [ fig:4sl2 ] , where the oscillators with indices @xmath236 in the non - bps strings are contracted with oscillators with indices @xmath237 in the bps state .",
    "thus the pp - wave cubic hamiltonian is non - zero in this case .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] in this paper we studied the structure constants of @xmath0 sym by focusing in particular on those cases where two of the states are half - bps and one is a part of a generic long multiplet . on the gauge theory side of the ads",
    "/ cft we used standard planar perturbation theory and explicitly computed various examples . on the string theory side we relied on the bmn limit of the ads@xmath2 iib string theory and computed the 3-string interactions corresponding to some of the gauge theory correlators previously analysed .",
    "the regime of validity of these computations is complementary : the bmn string theory is a reliable approximation of the full ads@xmath2 in the limit @xmath238 with @xmath239 fixed , while perturbative gauge theory computations require @xmath240 .",
    "we showed that the mixing discussed in  @xcite plays a crucial role in both string and gauge theories computations and the final result for the 3-point amplitudes depends on the mixing coefficients , even if these coefficients can not be fixed simply by using the standard approach of diagonalising the 2-point correlators .",
    "this does not come as a surprise , since the states transform correctly under the relevant superalgebra only when the mixing has been appropriately taken into account .",
    "we paid particular attention to the constraints on the 3-point function following from the @xmath1 bonus symmetry  @xcite , the ope s of the 4-point correlators among bps states  @xcite and the superspace approach to the @xmath0 sym  @xcite .",
    "our explicit field theory computations are performed in components and thus do not keep the superconformal invariance explicit ; nevertheless all our field theory results are consistent with the constraints just mentioned thanks to non - trivial cancellations involving the mixing discussed above .",
    "all constraints that follow from symmetry reasons should be valid at all orders in the t  hooft coupling and thus should be manifest also in the relevant string computations .",
    "however , the situation is less clear on the string side of the correspondence . in section  [ sec :",
    "string ] we discussed various examples of 3-string interactions in the bmn limit ( again with two bps and one non - bps strings ) . again some possible of the violating 3-point couplings vanish thanks to some `` miraculous '' cancellations which follow from the mixing discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , in the same section , we have other examples of 3-point amplitudes that violate either the @xmath1 bonus symmetry or the constraints following from the superconformal ward identities . in these cases",
    "the cancellations among the various terms generated in the string computations are not complete . of course",
    ", it would be very interesting to understand better the source of this mismatch and we hope to come back to this point in the future .",
    "one possibity is that the pp - wave cubic hamiltonian  @xcite does not capture the structure constants beyond the bps sector either because some terms are missing or because the holographic relation with cft structure constants is more complicated than what is currently believed .    in order to understand whether one of these two possibilities is indeed correct",
    ", it would be clearly helpful to study the structure constants at strong coupling without relying on the bmn limit . as mentioned in the introduction , an approach that has been used to analyse",
    "the @xmath0 structure constants at strong coupling is to study the ope s of the 4-point function among bps operators  @xcite .",
    "this approach can not be used to isolate each single structure constant with a non - bps state , since at strong coupling these states develop large anomalous dimensions and decouple .",
    "however , it is possible to compute the 4-point functions in the bulk by using also the first non - trivial string corrections to the iib supergravity and this should give some information about the strong coupling behaviour of the 3-point function under study .",
    "a large class of string corrections in type iib have been explicitly written in a @xmath241 covariant form in  @xcite and at least one term appears to violate the conservation of the @xmath1 charge .",
    "a term of this type in the string corrected supergravity action is likely to induce unexpected @xmath1 violating amplitudes when used to compute witten s diagrams in ads . of course",
    ", it would be very interesting to capture some information about the structure constants at strong coupling directly by using ads@xmath2 string theory .",
    "this appears to be a challenging task , since , in this case , not even the spectrum is known in detail .",
    "however by using the pure spinor formalism  @xcite it might be possible at least to see whether the @xmath1 selection rule is a consequence of a zero - mode counting and hopefully to clarify the connections between the full ads@xmath2 computation and the results in the pp - wave and the supergravity limits .",
