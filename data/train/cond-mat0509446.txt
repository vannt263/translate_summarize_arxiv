    "the extraordinary experimental control achieved over atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) provides new testgrounds for phenomena issued from many different fields . on the one hand",
    "these systems allow to study extensively nonlinear phenomena such as four - wave mixing @xcite , propagation of bright @xcite and dark @xcite solitons or the dynamics of bloch oscillations in presence of atom - atom interactions @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the rapid progress in this field has lead to a number of fascinating experiments probing complex condensed matter phenomena , such as the mott transition in optical lattices @xcite , the creation of vortices @xcite , the josephson effect @xcite or the bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates link these two prominent fields of current research in a exciting and unique way .",
    "wave mechanical transport in atomic vapors appears as a new direction for these trans - disciplinary studies that provide deeper insights into transport phenomena in presence of interaction . indeed , bec systems are intrinsically phase coherent , as are the clean two - dimensional electronic structures studied in mesoscopic physics at low temperatures .",
    "besides , interaction is much more simply modeled in bec systems than the electrostatic electron - electron potential and its sign ( repulsive or attractive ) and strength can be tuned almost at will .",
    "the link between matter - wave physics and electronic transport phenomena became ultimately apparent with the advent of microscopic traps and waveguides for the atoms , known as _ atom chips _",
    "related studies include the attempt to generalize landauer s theory of conductance to cold atoms @xcite , the _ atom blockade _ phenomenon in quantum - dot like potentials @xcite as well as nonlinear resonant transport of bose einstein condensates @xcite , to mention just a few examples .    a new direction in this context is the transport of bose - einstein condensates through _ disordered _ potentials .",
    "a relevant question is to which extent a bose - einstein condensate is subject to anderson localization @xcite in presence of disorder , as well as how this scenario is affected by the atom - atom interaction .",
    "there is a growing interest in the bec community for issues related to the behavior of matter waves in disordered potentials .",
    "it started with the observation of `` fragmentation of the condensate '' over a microchip @xcite . nowadays a random potential is routinely engineered using an optical speckle pattern and its effects over the expansion of the condensate have been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to studies where the condensate is initially at rest , we focus in the present paper on the effect of disorder on a _ propagating _ bose - einstein condensate . in an adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the dynamics reduces to an effective one dimensional ( 1d ) transport problem , this is the so called `` 1d mean field regime '' @xcite .",
    "we furthermore assume that the mean kinetic energy of the atoms in the condensate is larger than the typical height of the barriers induced by the disorder potential , i.e. , perfect transmission is expected by classical mechanics . for the sake of concreteness , we restrict ourselves to one specific type of disorder : the one experienced by a condensate that is magnetically trapped above a corrugated microchip . to this end",
    "we introduce a model that could be characterized as a `` dirty wire model '' where the current in the microfabricated wire has white noise fluctuations .",
    "this simple model captures most of the caracteristics of the random potentials observed over corrugated microchips .",
    "we point out , however , that our results are not expected to be sensitive to the particular type of disorder , as long as the latter is sufficiently smooth and can be characterized by a well - defined correlation length .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the effect of disorder on the transmission of nonlinear waves mainly focussed on attractive interaction and looked for stationary solutions of the problem ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "then , one has to choose between fixed input and fixed output boundary conditions .",
    "the latter case is less realistic , but simpler to discuss : it leads to algebraic decay of the transmission @xcite .",
    "the former case is complicated by the advent of multistability .",
    "however , the results of knapp _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite show that , for short sample size , the mean transmission is poorly affected by a weak nonlinearity ( as compared to the linear case ) , whereas for larger samples and stronger nonlinearity , evidences of delocalization are found . .",
    "realistic transport processes of bose - einstein condensates are different from the above mentioned studies because they typically involve particles experiencing _ repulsive _ interactions .",
    "we will see below that in this case the assumption of stationarity is not appropriate because for large disordered region or strong nonlinearity stationary solutions are dynamically unstable . in typical experiments the population of a given final state",
    "can only be achieved through a time - dependent process ( such as the gradual filling of an initially empty waveguide with matter waves ) . as a result ,",
    "if a stationary scattering state is unstable , the transport properties of the condensate may be unrelated to the transmission coefficient associated with that state , whereas a study of stationary flows might misleadingly give some weigth to this state ( if the transmission is averaged over all possible stationary solutions for instance ) .",
    "we thus consider a setup that is relevant to experimental realizations and adapted to this specific transport scenario explicitely taking into account the possibility of time - dependent scattering : a coherent source of atoms emits matter waves that propagate in the magnetic waveguide and encounter on their path a disorder region of length @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the presence of a repulsive atom - atom interaction has dramatic effects on the transport properties of the condensate .",
    "as is the case for attractive nonlinearity , anderson localization is observed only in the regime of small interaction strengths and sample lengths . in this regime",
    "the transmission deacreases exponentially with @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , with a localization length @xmath2 modified by the interaction .",
    "for large sample lengths or strong interaction , time - dependent scattering processes occur .",
    "in contrast to the previous regime , one observes an ohmic decrease of the time - averaged transmission ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", we mention that it was demonstrated in @xcite that eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) exhibits two constant - density solutions : a low - density ( supersonic ) one and a high density ( subsonic ) one , where the transport is respectively dominated by the kinetic energy or by mutual interaction of the atoms .",
    "both solutions are plane waves of the form @xmath31 , but with different wavevectors @xmath29 and particle densities @xmath32 .",
    "as we are considering rather small condensate densities and large velocities in the waveguide , the supersonic solution will be the relevant one in the context of this paper .",
    "we now assume the presence of a disorder potential @xmath17 in the waveguide which is finite between @xmath33 and @xmath34 and vanishes elsewhere . in this case",

    "this question can be addressed by integrating the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) in presence of a source term that is localized in the upstream region and emits monochromatic matter waves .",

    "this approach provides a natural extension of the usual definition of transmission coefficients in quantum mechanics to the nonlinear case @xcite .    in the nonlinear regime , due to dynamical instabilities",
