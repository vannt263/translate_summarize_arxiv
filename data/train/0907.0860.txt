    "from the cosmological observations such as type ia supernova ( sn ia )  @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , and large scale structure ( lss )  @xcite , there are strong evidences for dark energy ( de ) which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the most naive de candidate is the cosmological constant ( cc ) introduced by einstein .",
    "although cc is consistent with the cosmological observations , there exists a fine - tuning problem  @xcite : cc ( @xmath5 ) is extremely small comparing to the known energy scales such as the reduced planck scale @xmath6 ( about @xmath7 ) in general relativity and the electroweak scale ( about @xmath8 ) in particle physics , and we do not have any symmetry which can protect the tiny cc against quantum corrections ( supersymmetry must be broken above the electroweak scale ) .",
    "this fine - tuning problem is the greatest challenge in high energy physics .",
    "also , there is a coincident problem  @xcite : why the de and dark matter energy densities are comparable today since their evolutions are different as the universe expands .",
    "therefore , cosmologists and particle physicists have proposed some other de models , for example , quintessence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , @xmath9-essence  @xcite , tachyon  @xcite , quintom  @xcite , hessence  @xcite , chaplygin gas  @xcite , yang - mills condensate @xcite , etc .",
    "the de problem might be a problem in quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not have a complete theory of quantum gravity right now .",
    "fortunately , an important progress in the studies of the black hole theory and string theory is the proposal of the holographic principle  @xcite , which may be considered as a fundamental principle of quantum gravity and then shed some light on the de problem . using the effective quantum field theory , cohen , kaplan and",
    "nelson suggested that the quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath10 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the quantum zero - point energy density  @xcite .",
    "thus , the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff scale of a system is connected to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff scale .",
    "applying this idea to the whole universe , we can consider the vacuum energy as de with density @xmath13 .",
    "choosing the largest ir cutoff @xmath10 which saturates the inequality , we obtain the holographic de density @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an unknown constant due to the theoretical uncertainties and can only be determined by observations .",
    "interestingly , taking @xmath10 as the size of the current universe which is the hubble radius @xmath16 , one finds that the de density is close to the observed value .",
    "however , hsu  @xcite pointed out that this yields a wrong equation of state for de .    to solve this problem , li  @xcite chose the future event horizon of the universe as the ir cutoff , and found that the model is a viable de model .",
    "however , there exists an obvious draw back concerning causality : the event horizon is a global concept of space - time , and the existence of event horizon depends on the future evolution of the universe , _ i.e. _ , the event horizon exists if and only if the universe is accelerating .",
    "so , the original holographic de model has presumed the existence of accelerated expansion . to avoid the causality problem , cai proposed the agegraphic de model in which the age of the universe can be chosen as the ir cutoff  @xcite . a new version of this model , which replaces the age of the universe by the conformal age of the universe , was suggested as well  @xcite .",
    "moreover , gao , wu , chen , and shen proposed the holographic ricci de model where the average radius of the ricci scalar curvature is chosen as the ir cutoff  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of these models have been studied extensively  @xcite .    in this letter , to obtain the accelerating universe and solve the causality problem , we propose a modified holographic de ( mhde ) model with the hubble scale as the ir cutoff , and the uv and ir connection is modified by using the black hole mass in higher dimensions . as a concrete example",
    ", we consider the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) models which have infinite extra dimension(s )  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic distance scale in such theories is called the crossover scale @xmath17 ( for definitions , please see section ii . ) . at the distances that are smaller than @xmath17 ,",
    "we observe four - dimensional gravity . while at the distances larger than @xmath17 , we observe higher - dimensional gravity .",
    "so at the ir energy scale which is smaller than @xmath18 ( or say at the distance larger than @xmath17 ) , we need to consider the effect of extra dimensions . in particular , the mass of the higher - dimensional black hole is different from that of the four - dimensional one . therefore , the uv cutoff scale in the mhde model is different from that in the original holographic de model .",
    "moreover , our model provides a way to probe the ir infinite extra dimensions : the dgp model is dual to the mhde model in five dimensions , and the @xmath0cdm model is dual to the mhde model in six dimensions .",
    "interestingly , with the hubble scale as the ir cutoff scale , we can not only obtain the observed de density with correct equation of state , but also avoid the causality problem .",
    "the best fit value indicates that there might exist two ir infinite extra dimensions .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "we present our model in section ii .",
    "and we discuss the observational constraints in section iii .",
    "our conclusion is in section iv .",
    "first , let us briefly review the dgp model and its generalization  @xcite .",
    "the theory is a brane - world model which is embedded in a space - time with ( asymptotically ) flat infinite @xmath19 extra space dimensions .",
    "all the standard model ( sm ) particles are localized on the d3-branes , and the corresponding cut - off scale on the observable d3-branes can be the grand unification scale or higher .",
    "also , the gravity spreads over the whole @xmath20 space - time dimensions .",
    "thus , the action is @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the coordinates for the minkowski space - time and the extra space dimensions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the metric for the whole space - time , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the reduced metric on the d3-branes , @xmath28 is the high - dimensional planck scale , @xmath29 is the brane tension , and @xmath30 is the sm lagrangian  @xcite . the characteristic distance scale in such theories is called the crossover scale . for five - dimensional space - time with @xmath31 , the crossover scale is  @xcite @xmath32 and for six- or higher - dimensional space - time with zero tension branes , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath33 , the crossover scale is  @xcite @xmath34 interestingly , at distance smaller than @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 , we observe the four - dimensional gravity , while at distance @xmath36 , we indeed observe high - dimensional gravity . moreover , from the data on sub - millimeter gravity measurements  @xcite and the accelerator , astrophysical and cosmological data  @xcite , the lower bound on the value of @xmath28 is @xmath37 . also , from the solar system measurements of newton s law , one obtains the upper bound on @xmath28 : @xmath38 for five - dimensional space - time , and @xmath39 for six- and higher - dimensional space - time  @xcite .    the idea of holography may be used to solve the cc problem @xcite .",
    "cohen , kaplan and nelson proposed that for any state with energy @xmath40 in the hilbert space , the corresponding schwarzschild radius @xmath41 is less than the ir cutoff @xmath10 @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "a relationship between the uv cutoff @xmath42 and the ir cutoff is derived , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath43 @xcite . here",
    "the relationship @xmath44 between the mass and the horizon of the schwarzschild black hole in four dimensions is used . in @xmath45 dimensions with @xmath46 ,",
    "the mass of the schwarzschild black hole is @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "if we can see the effect of extra dimensions , then we have the relation @xmath49 and the de density @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an unknown constant accounting for theoretical uncertainties .",
    "if we choose the hubble horizon as the ir cutoff , then we get the mhde density @xmath52 the mass of the schwarzschild black hole is @xmath53 thus , the high - dimensional black hole mass can be much higher than the planck scale in our scenarios .",
    "however , to compare with particle physics theory , we consider the lagrangian density . in our models",
    ", we have the dark energy density as follows @xmath54 thus , for the model with one or two extra dimensions , the dark energy density is proportional to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "thus , they are consistent with particle physics theory . however , for the models with three or more extra dimensions , the dark energy density is proportional to @xmath57 with @xmath58 , thus , these models may have pretty large dark energy density , which is not consistent with particle physics .",
    "therefore , we only consider one or two extra dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the space - time dimensions are five and six , respectively . in particular , for five - dimensional and six - dimensional space - time",
    ", we obtain the observed de density for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "now the friedmann equation becomes @xmath61 where the matter energy density @xmath62 and the radiation energy density @xmath63 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ mholrhod ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ freq1 ] ) , we get @xmath64 this is the same as the @xmath65 dark energy model proposed by dvali and turner in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath66 .",
    "the crossover scale in this model is @xmath67 in  @xcite , the model is proposed as the modification to the friedmann equation motivated by extra dimensions , and it was found that @xmath68 to be consistent with astronomical observations .",
    "here we use the holographic idea to derive the above friedmann equation and take the model as a dark energy model .",
    "we also connect the holographic idea with the effect of ir infinite extra dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath65 has the physical meaning of the number of the spatial dimensions .",
    "if @xmath69 , _ i.e. _ , with one extra dimension , we recover the dgp model for the flat case .",
    "so the dgp model may be interpreted as the holographic dark energy model with the hubble scale as the ir cutoff .",
    "when @xmath70 , _ i.e. _ , with two extra dimensions , we recover the standard @xmath0cdm model . in other words , the cosmological constant is a special case of our model , and it may be interpreted as the effect of two extra dimensions . in our model , we choose the hubble scale as the ir cutoff , so the problem of circular reasoning is avoided .",
    "in addition , the choice of the hubble scale as the ir cutoff is more natural than other choices .",
    "combining the friedmann equation ( [ freq1 ] ) with the energy conservation , we get the equation of state parameter @xmath71 for the mhde @xmath72 so @xmath71 changes from @xmath73 during the radiation dominated era to @xmath74 during the matter dominated era .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath75 is @xmath76 using the friedmann equation @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we obtain at the transition redshift @xmath79 @xmath80 since the transition from deceleration to acceleration happened very recently , we can ignore the contribution due to the radiation , and then we have @xmath81",
    "now we use the observational data to fit the mhde model .",
    "the parameters in the model are determined by minimizing @xmath82 . for the sn",
    "ia data , we use the constitution compilation of 397 sn ia @xcite .",
    "the constitution sample adds 185 cfa3 sn ia data to the union sample @xcite .",
    "the addition of cfa3 sample increases the number of nearby sn ia by a factor of roughly @xmath83 and reduces the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the union compilation has 57 nearby sn ia and 250 high-@xmath84 sn ia .",
    "it includes the supernova legacy survey @xcite and the essence survey @xcite , the older observed sn ia data , and the extended data set of distant sn ia observed with the hubble space telescope . to fit the sn ia data , we define @xmath85 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_i},\\ ] ] where",
