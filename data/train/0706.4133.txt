    "obtaining an unbiased sample of cluster members and thus an estimate of the stellar mass function is difficult for the latter two clusters ; the central cluster contains a mixed variety of stars having different ages , and the 4 myr `` old '' quintuplet cluster appears already widely dispersed ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 in figer et al .",

    "gerhard suggested that the cores of these clusters might survive tidal disruption and supply the population of young , high - mass stars observed close to the black hole , where conditions are inhospitable to in - situ star formation ( morris 1993 , ghez et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) . however , dynamical simulations suggest that a cluster mass of @xmath7 is required for a dense core to reach the central parsec within the lifetime of the high - mass stars ( kim & morris 2003 ) , much more massive than the arches today with @xmath8 .",

    "10 stars were used to create the psf .",
    "the detection threshold was set to 3@xmath25 above the local background , and a psf correlation threshold of 0.7 was imposed .",
    "the relatively low correlation threshold enables us to include close neighbours in the final photometry file , while higher thresholds tend to omit faint sources embedded in the haloes of bright stars . in order to reject false detections ,",
    "each star entering the calibrated @xmath12 catalogue was required to be detected in the deep @xmath12 exposure and in all three auxiliary frames .",
    "this strict requirement led to the rejection of most psf and image artefacts .",

    "bright sources on the combined nirc2 @xmath12 image provide the reference frame for the proper motion analysis .",
    "a geometric transformation to convert naco pixel positions to the nirc2 frame was derived using the iraf _ geomap _ task . by deriving the transformation from bright and intermediate sources measured directly on both images ,",
    "the different optical distortions between nirc2 and naco are taken into account within the limitations of the two - dimensional , second - order polynomial fit performed with _",
    "geomap_. the geometric solution is created iteratively by minimizing the x , y residual displacements . the final residual rms deviation was 2 and 0.7 mas in the x and y direction , respectively . in the following analysis , we therefore assume a systematic contribution of 2 mas in the proper motion uncertainty .    the selection of proper motion members was based on matching the nirc2 source catalogue with the transformed naco catalogue using a matching radius of 40 mas .",
    "this radius provided the detection of most moving sources while avoiding wrong matches with close neighbours in the dense stellar cluster field . in order to exclude artefacts from the complex psf structure , we require that each source be detected in either the naco or nirc2 @xmath21-band image in addition to both @xmath32-band images . after blind matching ,",
    "the matched sources were visually inspected on the nirc2 and naco @xmath32-band images , and 13 sources with merged centroids in naco due to the lower resolution or located on the edge of the @xmath17 nirc2 field of view were removed from the matched catalogue , as the biased definition of their stellar centroids affected their apparent motion .",
    "the final proper motion catalogue comprises 419 objects .",
    "the proper motion of the arches cluster is derived from the relative motion of the cluster with respect to field stars .",
    "this relative motion depends on the geometric transformation between both data sets .",
    "as detailed below , the transformation is chosen such that proper motions over the 4.3 yr baseline are measured in the reference frame of the cluster . before deriving the proper motion of the cluster",
    ", this reference frame will be introduced .",
    "the geometric transformation between naco and nirc2 was derived from bright sources in the magnitude range @xmath33 mag . as can be seen in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd , fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) , this regime is composed of stars on the arches main sequence and thus likely cluster members . by defining the transformation from cluster stars , a cluster reference frame is created in which arches members cluster around an east - west motion of @xmath34 , and north - south motion @xmath35 , implying that in the cluster reference frame the net spatial displacement of the cluster should be zero .",
    "the spatial displacement of stars in the arches field is shown in east - west and north - south motion in fig .",
    "[ xymove ] .",
    "two distinct features dominate in this diagram : i ) the dense clump of stars clustering around ( 0,0 ) , which are cluster member candidates in the cluster reference frame , and ii ) the scattered population of sources in the lower right quadrant .    the fact that fig .",
    "[ xymove ] reveals two distinct populations provides a means of identifying arches cluster members based on proper motions .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 circles from a gaussian fit to the relative motion distribution centered on zero are enveloping member candidates in fig .",
    "[ xymove ] , and arches members are selected with less than @xmath38 mas spatial displacement in 4.3 years , corresponding to a proper motion @xmath39 mas / yr . while cluster candidates are confined to a dense clump with small intrinsic scatter ( @xmath40 mas / yr ( rms ) ) , the field population displays twice as large rms scatter ( @xmath41 mas / yr ( rms ) ) .",
    "this scatter is expected if we observe a mixed population of stars tangentially or radially along their orbits over a large range of distances .",
    "field stars along the line of sight are expected to display a wide range in dynamical properties depending on their orbits .",
    "it is therefore surprising that field stars are predominantly found in the south - west quadrant in fig .",
    ". this apparent south - west displacement of field stars in the arches reference frame can most easily be explained by the arches moving to the north - east with respect to the field .",
    "the observed north - east motion of the cluster is consistent with a recent prediction from the x - ray emission of the bow shock created by the arches during its impact on the nearby cloud @xcite .",
    "the median displacement of the field in the cluster reference frame is @xmath0 mas/4.3 years or @xmath1 mas / yr , which translates to a relative motion of the cluster with respect to the field of @xmath42 km / s assuming a distance of 8 kpc . with a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath43 as measured from north to east ,",
    "the direction of the proper motion vector is parallel to the galactic plane ( pa@xmath44 ) within the uncertainties .    before employing the proper motion to derive the 3-dimensional space motion of the cluster",
    ", we investigate the sources of uncertainty contributing to the proper motion measurement .",
    "the quoted accuracy in the proper motion measurement is achieved by the large number of 67 reference field sources contributing to the average relative motion between the cluster and the field .",
    "the uncertainties were calculated adding the fixed component from the geometric transformation , 2 mas/4.3 yrs = 0.5 mas / yr , in quadrature to the standard deviation in field star velocities , @xmath45 mas / yr , normalized to the number of field stars , @xmath46 , @xmath47 mas / yr . the uncertainty from the zeropoint defined by the 328 cluster candidates is @xmath48 mas / yr , and therefore negligible .",
    "the final uncertainty from random deviations in the relative motion of @xmath49 mas / yr is dominated by the geometric transformation between naco and nirc2 , which includes residual optical distortion differences and the resolution - dependent uncertainty from fitting the centroid to the light distribution of each star .",
    "in addition , one might consider that the internal velocity distribution may contribute to the rms scatter in cluster candidate motions .",
    "the cluster velocity dispersion can be estimated as @xmath50 ( binney & tremaine 1987 , eq .",
    "4 - 80b ) , where @xmath51 is the total cluster mass and @xmath52 pc the half - mass radius @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath53 km / s or 0.2 mas / yr , which is significantly smaller than the rms scatter of 0.73 mas / yr observed in candidate cluster stars .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of 2 mas/4.3 yrs or 0.5 mas / yr imposed from the geometric transformation between naco and nirc2 presently limits our ability to detect the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster . with a relative astrometric accuracy of 0.3 mas measured between the three nirc2 auxiliary frames ,",
    "the internal velocity dispersion can be observed on a timescale of a few years .",
    "a second epoch of nirc2 data will avoid the transformation uncertainty inherited from the different optical distortions and spatial resolution in the naco and nirc2 data sets , thereby decreasing the overall uncertainty in the proper motion measurement , and providing the potential to resolve the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "the random uncertainty derived above dominates the proper motion measurement only in the absence of systematic uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties can arise from the choice of selected field stars , as well as a bias towards field sources on the near side of the bulge . in fig .",
    "[ xymove ] , the field selection was based on the density of stars in proper motion space .",
    "we can investigate the uncertainty in our measurement due to the field sample selection using defined subsamples . as we expect a larger positional uncertainty for fainter stars , the first sample consists of stars brighter than the apparent cluster main sequence cutoff at @xmath54 mag . as bulge stars are predominantly faint",
    ", this bright sample consists of 27 sources , and yields @xmath55 km / s .    as a consequence of the high foreground extinction towards the galactic center",
    ", our observations could be biased to stars on the near side of the bulge .",
    "such a bias should be revealed in a proper motion difference between blue and red sources .",
    "thus we define two sets for our second sample : a set blueward of @xmath56 mag , encompassing the cluster main sequence and the bulge red clump , and a very red sample @xmath57 mag with presumed background stars .",
    "the cluster proper motion derived from the `` blue '' field sample of 45 stars becomes @xmath58 km / s , while the red sample of only 22 stars yields @xmath59 km / s .",
    "the larger number of stars in the `` blue '' sample indicates that there is a bias towards stars on the near side of the bulge in the complete sample .",
    "the difference of @xmath60 km / s is in excellent agreement with the proper motion difference of stars on the near and far side of the bulge , measured using red clump giants to @xmath61 mas / yr or @xmath62 km / s @xcite .",
    "the higher cluster motion of @xmath59 km / s as measured from the very red sources indicates that the bias acts to decrease the cluster velocity .",
    "the absolute proper motion might be closer to the mean between the red and blue sample , @xmath63 km / s , in good agreement with the @xmath64 km / s derived for the full sample .",
    "nevertheless , the lower number of stars in the red sample indicates that sources with high extinctions or large distances , which have higher relative streaming velocities than sources closer to the gc , are predominantly lost . as this problem arises in all proper motion studies toward the gc ,",
    "the maximum expected velocity for stars on the far side of the bar is not firmly known .",
    "this implies that the proper motion measurement remains a lower limit .",
    "a final concern may arise from the sampling of field stars itself .",
    "the bias from the @xmath65 field star sample can be estimated by deriving the cluster motion from a random sample of half of the field stars , @xmath66 .",
    "in 100 random samples we obtain proper motion values between 195 and 227 km / s , with a mean and standard deviation of @xmath67 km / s , in excellent agreement with the value derived from the full sample above . in summary , we conclude that the only systematic uncertainty in the proper motion might arise from the bias to bulge stars in front of the gc , but the effect is small and the measurements agree very well within the uncertainties . therefore , we use the full sample of field stars to obtain a conservative lower limit to the proper motion of the cluster in an absolute reference frame , and adjust the uncertainty to account for the possible bias accordingly , @xmath2 km / s .      in order to derive the absolute motion of the arches cluster in the galaxy , we need to understand the field restframe .",
    "the cmd ( fig .  [ cmd ] ) shows that most of the proper motion selected field stars are faint and red .",
    "the clump of field stars at @xmath68 mag is consistent with red clump stars at @xmath69 kpc and @xmath70 mag ( @xmath71 , alves 2000 ) , and the faint population , @xmath72 mag , covers the regime of evolved bulge stars .",
    "sumi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) analysed a sample of @xmath73 stars repeatedly observed in ogle - ii fields towards the bulge , and concluded that proper motions of red giants and red clump stars are consistent with zero mean proper motion with respect to the gc .",
    "only blue foreground disk stars display a systematic deviation in mean proper motion from the gc , which is interpreted as the tangential motion of disk stars at 1 - 2 kpc distance from the sun . in the nirc2 field of view",
    ", we only observe seven stars significantly bluer ( @xmath74 mag ) than the deeply extincted cluster population ( @xmath75 mag , stolte et al .",
    "2002 ) , so that we can safely rule out significant contamination by disk stars .",
    "sumi et al .  ( 2003 ) derived the streaming motion of red clump stars in bulge fields from proper motions , and interprete the observed velocity difference of 57 km / s between sources in front of and behind the gc as the rotation of the galactic bar in the same direction around the gc as the sun .",
    "this streaming motion is consistent with the bar models constructed from co line - of - sight velocity maps ( binney et al .",
    "1991 , englmaier & gerhard 1999 ) . in the context of the 3d reference frame ,",
    "a detection bias towards sources on the near side of the bar causes a systematic loss of stars with proper motions in the opposite direction to the arches motion ( compare to the orbit sketches in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] ) .",
    "the number counts of 22 very red sources as opposed to 45 blue sources indicate a loss of sources at the far side of the bar .",
    "the selective detection of sources in the front of the gc shifts the apparent mean motion of the field stars away from zero in the same direction as the arches cluster , which , when corrected , increases the cluster velocity with respect to the gc even further .",
    "the 3d motion derived from the proper motion sample is therefore a lower limit to the space motion of the arches with respect to the gc .",
    "the heliocentric line - of - sight velocity of the arches cluster was measured spectroscopically to be @xmath76 km / s @xcite .",
    "combining the proper motion with the line - of - sight velocity yields the relative 3-dimensional space motion of the arches , @xmath77 km / s , directed away from the gc to the north - east , and away from the sun .",
    "the measurement of the arches space velocity allows us to compare the cluster velocity with measured orbital velocities of stars and clouds in the inner galaxy , with the aim of deriving the first qualitative constraints on the cluster orbit around the gc by considering known orbital families in comparison with the 3d cluster motion . the cluster orbit and , in particular ,",
    "the gc distance are critical for the formation and dynamical evolution of the cluster in the gc potential , for the amount of tidal mass loss of cluster members along its orbit , and for the potential for inspiral towards the gc .      due to the earlier lack of knowledge on the cluster motion and the limited understanding of the inner galaxy , and in particular the ignoring of the thick nuclear stellar disk between 20 and 200 pc ( launhardt et al .",
    "2002 ) , previous studies of the dynamical evolution and tidal disruption of the arches in the gc potential assumed for simplicity that the cluster moves on a circular orbit in a spherically symmetric mass distribution ( kim et al .",
    "2000 , portegies zwart et al .",
    "2002 ) . without further constraints , a circular orbit in a",
    "spherically symmetric potential is the simplest case and most straightforward assumption . from this assumption ,",
    "the amount of mass loss and the true distance of the arches from the gc were derived .    in the case of a circular orbit in a spherically symmetric potential ,",
    "the orbital parameters are determined by the 3d velocity and projected radius vectors .",
    "the circular orbit approximation allows us to compare the derived orbital parameters with observations in the inner galaxy , and to probe whether a circular orbit assumption is valid for the arches .    in a spherically symmetric potential ,",
    "the gravitational force only depends on the mass interior to the present galactocentric radius . while the potential in the inner galaxy is not spherically symmetric , this assumption is made in the concept of the enclosed mass vs.  radius relation providing the gravitational potential for previous simulations .",
    "as shown below , this concept is too simplistic to explain the 3d space motion of the arches cluster .    for a circular ,",

    ", we obtain @xmath88 pc , pointing towards us .",
    "the gc distance of the cluster in the circular orbit approximation would then be @xmath89 pc .",

    "the enclosed mass required to obtain a circular , keplerian orbit with an orbital velocity of @xmath3 km / s at a radius of @xmath90 pc is @xmath91 .",
    "however , from the modeled mass distribution in the inner galaxy , the enclosed mass within @xmath92 pc is @xmath93 @xcite , where the mass contains both interstellar matter and stars as measured from near to far ir observations with iras and cobe / dirbe .",
    "this discrepancy in the inferred enclosed mass provides a first indication that the arches moves on a non - circular orbit .",

    "the absolute minimum of the distance to the gc occurs when the arches is on a radial orbit .",

    "the high orbital velocity contradicts the recently suggested formation of the arches as a rejuvenated globular cluster ( lin & murray 2007 ) , as this scenario requires a small relative motion of the cluster with respect to gc clouds for an extended period of time .    in the asymmetric potential of the inner galaxy , the arches completed at most one orbit during its lifetime , and came into the central 10 pc only if it is presently located closer than 33 pc from the gc , close to its projected distance .",
    "these constraints restrict the amount of material possibly tidally stripped from the cluster , and render it highly unlikely that star clusters with arches properties suffer sufficient energy loss to migrate inwards during the lifetime of the massive stars and contribute to the young population in the central parsec of the gc .",
    "this implies that with the arches and quintuplet clusters we are not observing progenitors to the gc comoving groups , providing observational confirmation of inspiral simulations ( gerhard 2001 , kim & morris 2003 ) .",
    "this supports the origin of the nuclear cluster from a substantially more massive cluster at small radii a few million years ago , or via in - situ star formation in the immediate gc environment .",
    "given the young age of the cluster and its long orbital relaxation timescale in the inner galaxy , the large space velocity should be inherited from the natal cloud . when comparing the cluster orbital motion with line - of - sight velocities of gas clouds in the inner galaxy using models of orbits in the dominating bar potential , we find that the 3d cluster motion is inconsistent with the closed x1 and x2 orbits suggested for gas clouds .",
    "although ample molecular material exists in the inner 200 pc which could harbour the formation of clusters like the arches , the dense , massive clouds have maximum line - of - sight velocities below 120 km / s , consistent with x2 orbital velocities , but significantly lower than the present - day orbital velocity of the cluster . in the standard cloud fragmentation scenario , a dense , massive cloud must have existed on a high - velocity orbit 2.5 myr ago to generate the cluster .",
    "in addition , if a significant fraction of the dense clouds on x2 orbits would form starbursts , more clusters like the arches or quintuplet should be observed .",

    "however , for the arches to inherit the large orbital velocity from an x1 cloud , this model requires a massive , high - density cloud orbiting on an x1 orbit 2.5 myr ago , while clouds sufficiently dense to be triggered into an intense starburst event are only observed in the x2 orbital zone today .",
    "alternatively , a collision with an infalling high - velocity cloud ( e.g. , crawford et al .",
    "2002 ) could also trigger star formation and propel the cluster on a highly eccentric orbit .",
    "the fact that the arches moves predominantly parallel to the galactic plane and has a vertical velocity of only @xmath175 km / s indicates that the cluster did not originate from a collision with a vertically infalling cloud . if both the arches ( 2.5 myr ago ) and quintuplet ( 4 myr ago ) , as well as sgr b2 were triggered by cloud collisions , this would indicate a substantial cloud collision in the inner @xmath144 pc approximately every 2 myr .",
    "a cloud collision was suggested as the trigger for massive star formation in sgr b2 by hasegawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who interpret the velocity structure observed in @xmath176co as a dense clump colliding with a massive molecular cloud of lower density .",
    "these authors investigate two scenarios of cloud collisions near the galactic center , i ) a collision between two cmz clouds , one of which moves on an elongated orbit in the bar , and ii ) an infalling cloud originating above the galactic plane .",
    "the first scenario can originate from a cloud on an x1 orbit moving into higher density clouds on x2 orbits , as suggested above .",
    "however , hasegawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) crudely estimate the rate for such collisions to be as low as one collision per 200 myr , which could not explain the occurence of the arches , quintuplet , and sgr b2 at the same time .",
    "these authors point out that the rate of infalling clouds is not well constrained , and they do not provide an estimate for the second scenario .",
    "bally et al .  (",
    "1988 ) identify a low - density molecular structure that is inclined by up to @xmath177 out of the galactic plane , and point out that material on such inclined orbits has to cross the cmz clouds in the plane twice along one orbital path , leaving ample opportunity for cloud - cloud interactions .",
    "alternatively , the arches could have an exceptionally high velocity , and might have formed in a different mode than its neighbours .",
    "currently , neither the collision rate nor the spontaneous starburst rate in the gc are well constrained .",
    "the observations of 3d space motions of the neighboring clusters will shed additional light on their origin .",
    "our measurement of the cluster motion will constrain dynamical evolution models in a realistic bar and nuclear cusp potential including energy loss along the orbit , which is the required next step to quantify the tidal mass loss of the cluster .",
    "finally , the proper motion selection of cluster members provides us with a powerful tool to remove the field contamination , and derive the tidal structure and unbiased stellar mass function of the arches cluster , which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
