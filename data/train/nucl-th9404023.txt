    "the traditional theory of nuclear structure is based on the schrdinger equation with a nucleon  nucleon ( nn ) potential that has its origin in meson exchange . in this nonrelativistic approach ,",
    "one fits the nn potential to the empirical properties of the deuteron and to low - energy nn scattering data , and one then attempts to predict the behavior of many - nucleon systems .",
    "a natural and appealing generalization of this approach is to incorporate special relativity by using a relativistic quantum field theory with explicit meson and baryon degrees of freedom .",
    "these degrees of freedom are chosen because they are the most efficient for describing low- and medium - energy nuclear experiments .",
    "this generalization allows us to study interacting , relativistic , nuclear many - body systems , which future experiments will examine .",
    "the two basic questions are : what kind of field theories should we use , and how well can we describe nuclear systems using field theoretical models with hadrons , which are actually particles with internal structure .",
    "these are broad and hard questions that can be answered only after intensive and systematic investigation .",
    "renormalizable relativistic quantum field theories with hadronic degrees of freedom , often called _ quantum hadrodynamics _ or qhd , have been studied for some time @xcite . at the level of the mean - field theory ( mft ) and one - loop approximation ( `` relativistic hartree approximation '' or rha )",
    ", these models can reproduce nuclear matter saturation and can realistically describe many bulk and single - particle properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "the dynamical assumption behind renormalizability in qhd is that the quantum vacuum and the internal structure of the hadrons can be described in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom alone .",
    "this assumption must ultimately break down at very short distances , and its limitations can be tested by explicit calculations .    some approximate qhd calculations beyond the one - loop level@xcite indicate large vacuum corrections , and even the validity of the one - loop vacuum contribution has been questioned @xcite .",
    "however , it is unlikely that we can calculate consistently beyond the mean - field level by introducing _",
    "ad hoc _ procedures , such as including only the nucleons in the fermi sea and simply throwing away dirac - sea contributions .",
    "indeed , it is already known that vacuum contributions are indispensable for maintaining the conservation of momentum and the electromagnetic current at the level of the random - phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite .",
    "these results imply that we must develop practical and reliable techniques that go beyond the mft and that include vacuum dynamics .",
    "a straightforward two - loop approximation for nuclear matter in the walecka model was examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where large vacuum corrections were found .",
    "the loop expansion does not appear to be convergent or asymptotic in any sense .",
    "this is not a surprise if we notice that the two - loop corrections are essentially perturbative in the large couplings .",
    "an alternative expansion in terms of meson loops ( after integrating out the baryon fields ) encounters the well - known ghost problems@xcite .",
    "even after the ghost poles are removed by redmond s `` surgical '' procedure@xcite , putting aside for the moment its physical significance , the vacuum contributions are still big@xcite .",
    "these calculations suggest that vertex corrections ( and short - range correlations ) should be included to compute vacuum loops reliably in qhd theories@xcite .",
    "since hadrons have internal substructure , one could argue for the use of nonlocal couplings and the introduction of _ ad hoc _ vertex form factors .",
    "this procedure was adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we remark that the introduction of form factors implies nonrenormalizability of the theory from the outset , and thus the renormalization procedure in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite needs justification .",
    "( in other words , various subtractions were made in the computation of the energy that arise naturally only in a renormalizable theory . )",
    "this _ ad hoc _ procedure also says nothing about off - shell or density - dependent effects , and poses difficulties when one tries to construct approximations that obey the desired conservation laws . moreover , although qcd in principle gives a complete description of nucleon structure , some part of the internal properties of the nucleon , particularly at large distances , must be equivalent to that provided by virtual hadron loops .",
    "these are the physical effects we intend to study in this paper .    as pointed out recently by milana@xcite , a theory with baryons and vector mesons contains proper vertex functions that are highly damped at large spacelike momentum transfers , due to the contributions from virtual _ bremsstrahlung _ summed to all orders .",
    "this damping arises from the long - range ( infrared ) structure of the vertex and so should be calculable within the qhd framework .",
    "since the qhd theory is renormalizable , the vertex function can be expressed in terms of the couplings and masses of the theory , with no _ ad hoc _ parameters .",
    "although it may be impossible to achieve a truly quantitative description of the hadron structure within a qhd model , due to the complicated nature of the vertex functions , our goal is to understand at least the qualitative features of the vertex functions implied in a hadronic theory and to see how these features affect calculations with vacuum loops .    in a recent calculation@xcite",
    ", the on - shell vector form factor was studied in a model with baryons and vector mesons .",
    "the behavior at large spacelike momentum transfer @xmath0 was determined by the leading logarithmic infrared behavior , which arises from the sum of all diagrams with vector ladders and crossed ladders across the hard vertex . at small @xmath0 ,",
    "the lowest - order vertex correction was used , and the complete vertex function was constructed by interpolating smoothly between the low- and high - momentum transfer regimes .",

    "we observe that the _ off - shell _ vertex functions should be used in a fully satisfactory calculation with loops .",
    "a full off - shell calculation is quite complicated , however , as one needs to know the off - shell behavior of the vertices at all spacelike momenta , as well as the modification of the vertices in the presence of valence nucleons at finite density .",
    "calculations exploring these off - shell vertex functions are in progress@xcite . here , as a first step , we use an on - shell approximation , in which the off - shell vertex functions are replaced by their on - shell forms at zero density .",

    ", we calculate the corrections to the one - loop energy : first by using the coupling parameters and mean fields determined at the one - loop level and then by refitting the total energy to the empirical nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "we find that the behavior of the two - loop corrections is significantly improved compared to that obtained with bare vertices@xcite .",

    "the contribution from the vector anomalous vertex is small compared to those from the vector charge and scalar vertices , but not negligible .",
    "the effects of the @xmath5 dependence and of the uncertainty in our interpolations for the form factors are modest compared to the overall size of the two - loop corrections , but are nevertheless significant on the scale of the nuclear matter binding energy .",
    "these new effects , which are usually neglected in studies using _ ad hoc _ form factors , are therefore important for a detailed description of the saturation properties of nuclear matter , because of the sensitive cancellations in the energy that occur near equilibrium density .",
    "it will certainly be necessary to extend our calculations to include the integrations over the off - shell vertex functions before any definitive statements can be made about nuclear matter saturation in this model .",
    "some remarks are in order about our calculation of vacuum fluctuations involving the scalar field . here",
    "we treat the scalar field that represents the @xmath6 meson as `` elementary '' , although it should , as generally believed , be considered as simulating the exchange of two correlated s - wave pions@xcite . our goal in this work is to develop tools for calculating vacuum corrections in a model with an nn interaction that has short - range repulsion and mid - range attraction , as is empirically observed .",
    "the walecka model is a simple one that satisfies this constraint .",
    "a more complete discussion of the role of chiral symmetry and the dynamical generation of the mid - range nn attraction , together with the implications for vacuum loops , should be considered as a necessary refinement of the work presented here@xcite .",

    "two different interpolation functions are used to join the two momentum - transfer regimes . whereas the resulting vertex functions are not determined uniquely at intermediate momentum transfers and are known only to within an error band , they are specified by the underlying couplings and masses in the model without the introduction of _ ad hoc _ parameters .",
    "we find that the two - loop corrections to the one - loop energy are considerably smaller than those computed earlier with bare vertices .",

    ". finally , the mean - square radii of the vector charge and scalar vertices increase with density roughly as the inverse of the baryon effective mass , which should give sensible results for the impact of this density dependence on the nuclear matter calculation .",

    "fourth , the description of the vertex functions at intermediate momentum transfer should be improved ; this may be possible by examining the dispersion relations that determine these functions .",
