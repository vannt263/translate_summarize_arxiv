    "reconnections and interactions between neighboring vortices are expected to work as a drive that transfers energy from large scales and feeds the kelvin - wave cascade . at finite temperatures the weak kelvin cascade",
    "is easily suppressed by the mutual friction dissipation@xcite . in order to understand the decay processes in the zero temperature limit at scales around and smaller than the intervortex distance , we must be able to distinguish between the roles of the kelvin - wave cascade , the kelvin waves directly induced by the reconnection events , and the mutual friction dissipation .",
    "here we concentrate on the kelvin waves generated by a single reconnection event and investigate whether a kelvin cascade originates from the reconnection event .",
    "we also illustrate how kelvin waves are damped by mutual friction .",
    "our analysis at zero temperature reveals that soon after a reconnection the vortex becomes filled with kelvin waves of different scale and that the presence of the shortest scales is limited only by the resolution .",
    "however , in accordance with earlier work@xcite , the evidence for the existence of the kelvin cascade remains weak since the observations can be explained by a redistribution of kelvin waves that are initially `` packed inside the reconnection cusp '' .",

    "the filament model should be a good model for @xmath2he - ii where the core radius is five to six orders of magnitude below the typical experimental intervortex distance .",
    "the model is extensively described , e.g. , in ref .",
    "numerically the vortex , a three - dimensional curve @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the length along the vortex and @xmath7 is time , is described by a sequence of points whose motion is here followed by the fourth order runge - kutta method .",

    "the identification of helical kelvin waves in a vortex tangle is a delicate problem@xcite .",
    "a proper identification is currently possible only in a few rare cases . in the case of a straight vortex , taken to be along the @xmath8 axis , and when the perturbations can be presented as @xmath9 , the fourier transformation of @xmath10 determines the kelvin - wave amplitudes @xmath11 .",
    "the kelvin occupation spectrum is typically defined as @xmath12 one should note that here the @xmath13 vector is a one - dimensional vector that defines the wavelength for the kelvin waves and should not be confused with the amplitude of the three - dimensional @xmath14 vector that is typically used when writing the energy ( velocity ) spectrum .    to provide a rough measure of the kelvin waves",
    "the distribution of curvature radii can be extracted from a vortex filament calculation . however , in the general case , to derive the kelvin spectrum from the curvature spectrum leads to an insolvable inverse problem . in case of a straight vortex , and in the limit of small kelvin amplitudes , these two spectra are closely related .",
    "unfortunately , the curvature spectrum is typically much too noisy and no proper spectrum can be determined from the curvature data .",
    "therefore , the analysis in ref .",

    "the kelvin spectrum is assumed to be valid from @xmath25 up to some cutoff scale @xmath26 , above which the spectrum is suppressed ( either due to numerical cutoff or , e.g. , by suppression due to mutual friction ) .",
    "since the predictions for the kelvin - wave spectrum vary from @xmath27 , in the case of strong wave turbulence with the vinen spectrum@xcite , to @xmath28 with the lvov - nazarenko spectrum@xcite , the rms curvature is not much affected by the scales near @xmath25 .",
    "the dominant contribution originates from scales near @xmath26 and may therefore be limited by the numerical resolution of the calculation .",
    "the different proposals for kelvin - wave spectra by vinen@xcite ( v ) , kozik - svistunov@xcite ( ks ) , and lvov - nazarenko@xcite ( ln ) in terms of @xmath15 are asymptotically given by@xcite @xmath29 generally , when the kelvin spectrum @xmath30 , the rms curvature is given by @xmath31 .",

    "we expect that at low enough temperatures the kelvin cascade becomes the dominant dissipation mechanism , which at scales smaller than the intervortex distance transports energy towards the core scales where it can be dissipated . for this to be true , at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the kelvin - wave cascade causes all our numerically traceable scales to be occupied by kelvin waves , and the rms curvature becomes determined by the numerical resolution . by repeating simulations with different resolutions one should be able to distinguish between different theories",
    "this is precisely what was done in ref .",
    "[ ] for decaying thermal counterflow , where the scaling for @xmath15 weakly supported the explanation in terms of the kelvin - wave cascade with lvov - nazarenko spectrum .",
    "the complicated situation was exemplified by the fact that the resolution could only be changed by a factor of 2.7 , and no firm proof was obtained .    in the following",
    "we consider a simpler case : a single reconnection of two initially linked vortices . in this case",
    "we are able to change the resolution by a greater amount .",
    "however , first we consider how the rms curvature is affected when a vortex configuration contains a sharp cusp where the curvature may diverge ( or at least yield values close to the inverse core size ) .",
    "as soon as one introduces a reconnection in the filament model one creates a sharp cusp in the vortex configuration . a simplified analytical model for a cusp where the curve has a simple discontinuity in the derivate , being smooth elsewhere , does not necessarily change the rms curvature by a large amount",
    ". however , numerically the effect can be much more dramatic . without additional",
    "smoothing , the maximum curvature at the cusp is the inverse resolution , and the region for this curvature peak is of the order of the point separation ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "smoothing does not necessarily solve the problem , because it only widens the region and restricts the maximum value .    if we split the integral into the `` smooth part '' ,",
    "far from the cusp , and into the region that is strongly affected by the numerics , one obtains that @xmath36 here the numerical factor @xmath37 is of the order of unity .",
    "it should depend weakly on the numerical details and , e.g. , on the initial angle between the vortices before the reconnection . in the limit of high resolution",
    "the last term becomes dominant , and the rms curvature due to numerics becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 is determined by the resolution .    if we consider the analytical model ( which is based on earlier numerical work ) for the vortex shape before the reconnection [ ] , we get further support for eq .",
    "( [ e.crmskmaxn ] ) .",
    "this estimate for the prereconnection vortex shape indicates that the cusp sharpens until the minimum distance reaches the core size ( after which the filament model is not valid any more ) such that eventually the region , where the curvature is of the order of the inverse core radius , is also of the order of the core diameter .",
    "simulations with the gross - pitaevskii model indicate that the curvature does not increase much from this limit imposed by the core radius and that it also has a similar magnitude after the reconnection@xcite .",
    "therefore , eq",
    ".  ( [ e.crmskmaxn ] ) should originate already from the prereconnection dynamics where @xmath26 is given by the core size .",

    "( [ e.crmskmax ] ) , it may give the dominant contribution when the kelvin amplitudes are small ( @xmath40 ) and when the resolution is not high enough , as shown below .",
    "its contribution also increases with increasing number of reconnections .",

    "( [ e.crmsnum ] ) , the contribution from the cusp region should result in a constant contribution that does not increase as the resolution is improved , i.e. , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is another constant of the order of unity . because @xmath41 is sensitive to the phases of the kelvin waves it can not be directly related to the kelvin spectrum .",
    "in order to better understand simulations where kelvin waves are produced by a single reconnection event , we first consider two simplified sets of simulations for a straight vortex where the determination of the kelvin spectrum is less challenging .",
    "these calculations model the time development _ after _ the reconnection . in both cases",
    "we occupy the straight vortex , taken to be along the @xmath8 axis , with a known kelvin spectrum parametrized as @xmath45 here @xmath46 determines the amplitude of the kelvin spectrum , and the @xmath47 s can be obtained by fourier transformation of @xmath10 , provided that the configuration remains single valued . at the instant when the single valuedness breaks , @xmath48 diverges .",

    "figure  [ f.crms ] illustrates the time development of the calculated rms curvature when the resolution is changed by a factor of 16 while @xmath99 .",
    "the inset illustrates that the curvature starts to increase already before the reconnection due to nonlocal interactions .",
    "this tends to strongly deform the vortex shape near the reconnection point .",
    "the noticeable jump at the instant of reconnection appears due to the appearance of the sharp cusp which is sharpest immediately after the numerical reconnection process .",
    "therefore , very locally the curvatures reach the values determined by the resolution .    after the reconnection",
    "the rms curvature may slightly increase and later decrease , but very soon after the reconnection @xmath15 remains constant .",
    "this is consistent with the lia approximation where @xmath15 is one of the several constants of motion and where cascade formation is not allowed .",
    "we have continued our @xmath106 = 0.005 mm calculation up to 100 s , and in addition to the small @xmath1211% decay of @xmath15 during this time ; it possesses oscillations with amplitude @xmath1211% and period @xmath122 s. this makes it difficult to say accurately from shorter simulation runs whether the curvature actually decays , or whether the initial small decay is just part of these oscillations .    if we plot the approximately constant value of @xmath15 after the reconnection as a function of the resolution one may observe a scaling relation , similar to the predictions above",
    "this is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the fitted exponent is 0.56 , which is closer to the prediction for a simple cusp than the one originating from the kelvin cascade with lvov - nazarenko spectrum .",
    "if we want to relate the exponent to a particular spectrum , the value corresponds to @xmath123 . within the cusp model , if we use the minimum point separation instead of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ e.crmskmaxn ] ) , we obtain @xmath124 .",
    "this is consistent with our prediction ( note that our configuration has two cusps ) .    .",
    "the _ inset _ shows a similar scaling relation as that for @xmath15 .",
    "the solid line is a fit , @xmath120 , to the data points , and the dashed lines are again the predictions from the lvov - nazarenko spectrum ( lower dashed ) and from the single cusp model ( upper dashed ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f.cave ] we have plotted the time development of the mean curvature .",
    "one may observe that the large sudden jump , present for the rms curvature , is now missing at the instant of reconnection .",
    "rather , the mean curvature starts to increase after the reconnection and finally stabilizes to a value very similar to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , also the @xmath41 satisfies a similar scaling relation as @xmath15 .    the time scale for reaching the final value in fig .  [ f.cave ]",
    "is determined by the resolution , and the increase in @xmath41 appears because small scale kelvin waves travel from the reconnection site and quickly fill the whole vortex .",
    "the better the resolution , the faster the smallest kelvin waves travel , and therefore the time scale for reaching the `` steady - state '' value for @xmath41 is directly proportional to the point separation used .",
    "this redistribution of the kelvin waves is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.curvatures ] , where the local curvatures are plotted at different times .     along the vortex after the reconnection of two rings .",

    "note the logarithmic vertical axis and that the maximum speed of the spreading kelvin waves is limited / defined by the resolution . ]",
    "one might argue that the increase in @xmath41 proves the existence of the kelvin cascade because it seems that more small scale structure appears .",
    "this is possible , but it is not the only possible explanation .",
    "first , scaling relations similar to those in eq .",
    "( [ e.crmskmax ] ) can not be easily derived for @xmath41 from the kelvin - wave spectrum .",
    "second , the mean curvature can be strongly increased by simply adjusting the phases of the kelvin waves without changing the kelvin spectrum , i.e. , without changing the amplitudes of small scale kelvin waves .",
    "this is illustrated by our `` test - cusp '' in sec .",
    "[ s.testcusp ] , see fig .",
    "[ f.decaytestcusp ] . in the small amplitude limit , which is not necessarily a proper assumption for a cusp ,",
    "the phases of kelvin waves do not change @xmath15 , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ e.crmsek ] ) .",
    "instead , the increase in the average curvature @xmath41 in fig .  [ f.cave ] after the reconnection appears as the phases `` randomize '' from their initial values at the instant of reconnection .",
    "the above phase randomization can be understood by considering a vortex with a shape of a triangle wave whose mean curvature is zero .",
    "it has a fourier representation with only odd indices @xmath127 whose amplitudes go like @xmath128 , corresponding to the kelvin spectrum @xmath129 ( equal to the kelvin occupation spectrum @xmath130 ) , not far from the ln spectrum .",
    "the kelvin waves present in this kind of configuration have a different frequency around the `` average vortex direction '' ( the direction which is realized when the amplitude of the triangle wave goes to zero ) and different propagation velocities .",
    "therefore , the vortex has soon a rather different shape with a mean curvature much larger than initially .",
    "this does not require any cascade .",
    "one may still wonder why the kelvin spectrum , determined from the decay curve at small scales where @xmath131 , does not show up in the scaling relation for @xmath15 , which is close to the cusp model ( or alternatively would correspond to kelvin spectrum with @xmath132 ) .",
    "one possible reason for this difference might be that the amplitude of the kelvin spectrum is too small , and therefore the cusp contribution still dominates when calculating the rms curvature . if we compare eqs .",
    "( [ e.crmskmax ] ) and ( [ e.crmskmaxn ] ) we find , by setting @xmath133 , that these estimates give the same value for @xmath15 when @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the general exponent in eq .",
    "( [ e.crmskmax ] ) for @xmath26 .",
    "we may crudely approximate that the energy associated to kelvin waves is related to the increase in vortex length , which is around 1% in our example case@xcite , and therefore @xmath136 .",
    "if we use @xmath137 from our fit , @xmath138 , and additionally approximate that @xmath23 = @xmath102 = 1 mm , we obtain that the small scale spectrum with @xmath131 , which dominates the calculation of rms curvature , should be visible in the scaling relation for @xmath15 if the resolution is better than @xmath106 = 0.01 mm .",
    "our resolution is almost always better than this . because we only see the steeper spectrum in the @xmath15 scaling ( fig .",
    "[ f.crms ] ) , the kelvin spectrum near the resolution might be steeper than @xmath1=3.5 , or alternative because the assumption @xmath139 is likely not valid , the rms curvature grows slower than predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ e.crmskmax ] ) . also , the above approximation is rather sensitive to the value of @xmath32 . by using @xmath140",
    "the critical resolution increases to @xmath106 = 0.0006 mm , which is the best resolution used .",
    "now , the cusp contribution should always dominate .",
    "in more complicated tangles , where vortices experience a large number of reconnections , the rms curvature can remain high only if the average time between successive reconnections is smaller than the time scale for mutual friction damping .",
    "this implies that the temperature must be low enough , as observed in simulations depicting decaying counterflow turbulence@xcite . by considering only a single reconnection event we are still far from explaining the dissipation in more complicated tangles where reconnections occur continually",
    ". the future question might be to explain what happens to existing kelvin waves when a new reconnection occurs .",
    "strong local stretching caused by a reconnection is likely to damp the pre - existing kelvin waves near the reconnection site .",
    "our method of determining the kelvin spectrum from the decay of @xmath15 , i.e. , obtaining @xmath1 from the fitted value of the decay exponent @xmath81 , could also be applied to more complicated vortex tangles .",
    "if one needs to avoid reconnections one could apply the method separately for each vortex .",
    "one may use rather high values of mutual friction and simulate only over a short time window to obtain the scaling law . actually , with large enough mutual friction the effects from the cascade are minimized and one obtains more accurately the kelvin spectrum which describes the initial state of the vortex . however , with large @xmath83 we can not immediately tell whether the spectrum is due to a cascade or due to other means like excitations from reconnections . if the cascade should become important at low enough temperatures , it should then result in the decay law of eq .",
    "( [ e.crmsdecay ] ) not being satisfied anymore .",
    "this change can be verified by repeating the decay analysis at these lower temperatures .",
    "a nonconstant decay exponent @xmath81 is likely to originate from a kelvin spectrum where @xmath1 is not universal .",
    "this is supported by the simulations , similar to the ones presented in sec .",
    "[ s.decaykwbymf ] , where we have occupied a straight vortex by using the vinen spectrum at low @xmath13 s ( @xmath141 ) with amplitude @xmath78 , while using a steeper spectrum with @xmath142 at high @xmath13 s with @xmath143 , such that the spectrum remains continuous .",
    "the resulting decay curve has a wide crossover region where @xmath81 changes but both asymptotics follow nicely the theory prediction , eq .",

    "the distribution of kelvin waves with different wavelengths , which becomes visible after the cusp relaxes , can be understood to arise from the prereconnection dynamics where the minimum distance between vortices necessarily sweeps all length scales down to the core scale .",
