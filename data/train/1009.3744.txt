    "however , these advantageous cases do not show up in every system or are simply out of interest .",
    "in general , approximations have to be applied to the system to overcome the problem of proliferation of terms .    in the method of _ perturbative continuous unitary transformations _ ( p - cut ) introduced by knetter and uhrig @xcite ,",
    "the non - diagonality @xmath37 is considered as small perturbation to the diagonal part @xmath21 of the bare hamiltonian . in this way",

    "a truncation scheme is defined that incorporates all terms considered to be important to the problem while other terms are neglected . in view of the numerous degrees of freedom , the choice of an adequate truncation scheme is a non - trivial task .",
    "it has to respect the system s physical properties . since the structure of the hamiltonian does not change during the flow , it is named self - similar . as a rule of thumb , a calculation is considered to be the more reliable the more terms",

    ", the modified flow equation reads @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{eq : cut - truncflow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we introduced the superoperator @xmath39 which denotes the application of the truncation scheme .    a natural description for many - body problems is provided by second quantization . since most of the low - energy physics can be preserved by low numbers of suitable quasiparticles , it is useful to define a truncation scheme neglecting all terms that create or annihilate more than a given number of quasiparticles .",
    "we emphasise that this truncation expressed second quantization does not imply any restriction of the hilbert space which is to be considered a major advantage .",
    "we stress that the action of a hamiltonian on a state containing @xmath24 quasiparticles can be split into a sum of irreducible terms affecting at most @xmath40 quasiparticles each ( see fig .",
    "[ img : feynman ] ) .",
    "thus , the truncation of high - particle irreducible processes does not imply the complete neglect of matrix elements between states of high quasiparticle numbers , but rather an extrapolation based on lower quasiparticle irreducible processes .    in extended systems ,",
    "often additional truncation criteria have to be applied in order to close the set of differential equations .",
    "an obvious choice for gapped systems with finite correlation lengt is to truncate according to the real - space range of the physical process generated by the term under study .",
    "we make use of this real - space truncation in sect .",
    "[ struct : extend ] .",
    "truncations cause quantitative errors in the calculated physical quantities and may possibly lead to divergences of the truncated flow , even though convergence has been proven for the untruncated flow . in their analysis of the flow equations for the anderson model @xcite , kehrein and mielke used a strict truncation scheme that includes only contributions of types that are already present in the bare hamiltonian .",
    "in a second step , they included a new contribution to the scheme and analyzed the new equations in order to assess its relevance . in their classification , terms that affect other matrix elements only by quantitative deviations and vanish in the limit @xmath41",
    "are denoted as irrelevant , or as marginal if they converge to a finite value .",
    "only terms that are able to change the behavior of the flow equations qualitatively , for instance that cause divergences if they are not treated properly , were considered to be relevant .",
    "this approach is suited to ensure the correct qualitative behavior of the effective model derived from the cut .",
    "but it does not provide a quantitative measure of the truncation errors .",
    "for practical computations , exploiting symmetries of the hamiltonian is generally very useful . to study hamiltonians of systems with an infinite number of sites , the use of translation symmetry is inevitable .",
    "let us suppose that we have chosen a basis of operators to express the hamiltonian .",
    "each term in the hamiltonian is given by one of these basis operators multiplied by a prefactor , its coefficient .",
    "although the hamiltonian is symmetric under a group of specific symmetry transformations , the symmetry of each individual basis operator may be lower . in this case , the coefficients of several basis operators fulfil linear conditions to ensure that their combination is invariant under the symmetry group . by parametrizing the hamiltonian in terms of linearly independent symmetric combinations of basis operators ,",
    "the number of coefficients to be tracked is significantly reduced saving both computation time and memory .",
    "technically this can be done by selecting one operator as a unique representative from which the complete symmetric combination can be obtained by taking the sum @xmath42 over a specific subgroup of the symmetry group of the hamiltonian .",
    "we emphasize that in general one has to clearly distinguish between the symmetry group of the hamiltonian and the superoperator @xmath42 .",
    "even if the hamiltonian displays a continuous symmetry such as the @xmath43 spin rotation symmetry , the number of constraints that can be derived for the coefficients of the hamiltonian s terms is limited .",
    "excluding translation symmetries , this means that only a finite number of terms are represented by one representative operator . therefore the number of symmetry operations to build the symmetric combination from a single representative is often finite although the exploited symmetry is continuous . in summary ,",
    "we take the superoperation @xmath42 as a technical tool to benefit from the hamiltonian s underlying full symmetry group .    moreover , the precise meaning of @xmath42 depends on the representative under study . as an example , a representative that shares the whole symmetry of the hamiltonian , e.g. , unity , is already identical to its corresponding symmetric combination . to this operator , @xmath42 acts as identity .",
    "the other limit is a representative operator that does not share any of the hamiltonian s symmetries .",
    "the superoperator @xmath42 applied to such a representative has to generate the fully symmetric combination of basis operators .",
    "since the sums @xmath42 occur on both sides of eq .  , the modified flow equation can be reduced to a representative expression requiring a sum for only one argument of the commutator .",
    "correction factors have to be introduced since different representative basis operators appearing in the commutator give rise to different numbers of basis operators in the fully symmetric combination which they represent .",
    "details on the implementation of symmetries in s - cut can be found in ref .  .",
    "denotes a sum over the maximal symmetry group for all representatives .",
    "in contrast , the superoperator @xmath42 stands in our notation only for the specific symmetry operations needed to generate the fully symmetric combination represented by the representative basis operator to which @xmath42 is applied .",
    "this leads to correction factors for the symmetrized flow equation instead of correction factors for coefficients of representatives as used by reischl . ]",
    "on truncating the flow equation , all information about the truncated terms is lost .",
    "it is common practice to neglect terms which are considered to be unimportant and to justify this _ a posteriori_. but even if these terms are not subject of the intended analysis of the effective hamiltonian , their omission leads to quantitative deviations for the coefficients of _ all _ terms in the hamiltonian because they are linked by the differential equations .",
    "we stress that the commutator of the generator and a truncated term may result in terms that comply with the truncation scheme , i.e. , that we want to compute quantitatively .",
    "thus the loss of information can not be limited to certain terms only .",
    "generically , truncation introduces errors in _ all _ coefficients of the hamiltonian .",
    "because of truncation , the transformation of a hamiltonian @xmath14 described by the truncated flow equation does not need to be unitary anymore .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of @xmath14 will be distorted during the flow .",
    "physical quantities calculated based on the effective hamiltonian are affected by finite inaccuracies . in the following sections [ struct : math - split]-e",

    "an additional physical consequence of truncation can be derived for real - space truncation schemes which neglect interactions beyond a certain range @xmath44 ( see sect .  [ struct : cut - truncscheme ] ) . due to the formulation in second quantization ,",
    "the s - cut method is capable to handle infinite systems . nevertheless , the truncation by range affects correlations on larger length scales .",
    "we observed that the coefficients of representatives in a truncated infinite system and a truncated periodic system with a certain size @xmath45 share the same set of differential equations , if the algebra is local .",
