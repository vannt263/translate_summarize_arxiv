    "the first part of this review is about exclusive electroproduction of a meson on a hadron , @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](a ) .",
    "the piece of theory at the origin of the recent theoretical and experimental interest in this topic is a factorisation theorem @xcite : in the bjorken limit of infinitely large photon virtuality @xmath1 at fixed @xmath2 and momentum transfer @xmath3 the amplitude for @xmath4 factorises into a skewed parton distribution ( spd ) in the target , a hard parton - photon scattering calculable in perturbative qcd , and the distribution amplitude of the meson , see fig .  [",
    "fig : factorise](b ) .",
    "the factorisation property makes this process a tool to measure leading - twist matrix elements of hadrons , in particular skewed parton distributions , which have aroused considerable interest , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "0.97    this factorisation holds only for longitudinal polarisation of the virtual photon . as @xmath5 becomes large ( and @xmath3 remains small ) the amplitude from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) scales like @xmath6 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "for transverse photons factorisation can not be established because the corresponding diagrams contain dangerous infrared regions , but the theorem tells us that the amplitude should be suppressed by at least one power : @xmath7 .",
    "of course , there are also power corrections to the leading behaviour of @xmath8 .    in the expression of the amplitude one has to perform an integral over the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the partons . an important point ( to which we will come back in sect .",
    "[ sec : polaris ] ) is that in order to obtain the leading power behaviour of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) the relative transverse momenta @xmath11 of the partons within their parent hadrons are approximated by zero in the hard scattering @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the spds and the meson distribution amplitude are themselves integrated over @xmath11 . taking into account the effect of finite @xmath11 in @xmath12 is part of the power corrections to the amplitude .",
    "important theoretical work has been done in the context of the high - energy limit , where @xmath13 is much larger than all other variables , including @xmath5 .",
    "many aspects of it are common with what we will discuss here , but others are specific to the small-@xmath14 limit ( such as the use of @xmath11-factorisation where the finite parton @xmath11 is not neglected in the hard scattering subprocess ) . for reasons of space / time i will not cover this field here .",
    "meson production comes in a variety of different channels , such as @xmath15 the multitude offers us a way to disentangle the spds for different parton species and with different spin structure . whereas the distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( in ji s notation , corresponding to radyushkin s @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) occur in vector meson production their parton helicity dependent counterparts @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 ) contribute to the production of pseudoscalars .",
    "note that all four distributions appear in the amplitude for deep virtual compton scattering , cf .",
    "@xcite .    as for the different parton species ,",
    "one has for instance the following separation in the vector meson channel @xcite : @xmath24 \\,\\pm\\ ,                    ( \\ldots)\\ , \\left [ ( u + \\overline{u } ) -                                       ( d + \\overline{d } ) \\right ]                    \\hspace{2em } \\mbox{(no gluons ) } , \\end{array } \\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.0}\\ ] ] where the @xmath25 stand for different @xmath9-dependent coefficients . for the charged mesons one has here made use of isospin relations to relate the spds for the transitions @xmath26 and @xmath27 to the ones for @xmath28 ( just as one relates the distribution amplitude of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "a similar separation of flavours can be achieved in the pseudoscalar channel with pions and kaons @xcite .",
    "spds contain nonperturbative physics that can not be accessed in the usual , diagonal parton distributions .",
    "an example is the exchange of particles in the @xmath3-channel , which can contribute in the region of @xmath9 where both partons come out of the hadron @xmath32 , instead of one coming out of @xmath32 and the other going into @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this is especially important for the distributions @xmath21 , which have the quantum numbers of pseudoscalar meson exchange : if @xmath3 is not too large then an exchanged pion ( and to a lesser extent a kaon ) are not very far from their mass shell @xcite .",
    "this consideration has important consequences for the process @xmath34 , which has been used to extract the pion form factor at large spacelike momentum transfer , cf .",
    "[ fig : pion ] . identifying the off - shell pion in the @xmath3-channel as a part of the nonperturbative quantity @xmath21 it is immediately clear that there are other contributions to the process , corresponding to contributions in @xmath21 which can not be described by meson exchange",
    "modelling the spds allows one to estimate the size of such contributions , and to study in which kinematical region one may hope to extract the pion form factor @xcite .",
    "this example illustrates how spds relate rather different physics ( such as the distribution of quarks in the proton and the quark - antiquark distribution in in the pion ) .",
    "0.97    a different aspect of pseudoscalar production has been investigated in @xcite , where it was proposed to compare the production of @xmath29 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 to study chiral dynamics and the breaking of flavour @xmath37 in the distribution amplitudes of these mesons .",
    "the weighting of @xmath38- , @xmath39- and @xmath40-quarks in electroproduction is different than from the one in the transitions @xmath41 and thus can provide a handle to separate the quark flavours .",
    "the cross section for meson production is always quadratic in the distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( or @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , even if the target and recoil hadrons are not polarised . to fully separate the different distributions one needs to measure the polarisation of at least one of the hadrons .",
    "a kinematic , rosenbluth - type separation as can be done for the elastic form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 is not possible here , because the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are themselves dependent on the energy of the scattering process , via the skewedness parameter @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as an example of a polarisation observable the transverse asymmetry of the target or the recoil",
    "hadron has been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "for pion production it is proportional to the product @xmath45 and therefore a good candidate to obtain information on @xmath21 .",
    "so far we have looked at the reaction @xmath48 as the production of a @xmath46 , described in the factorised form of fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) , followed by the decay @xmath49 .",
    "it is however possible to directly describe the reaction @xmath50 in a factorised framework , without referring to the formation and decay of a resonance : the distribution amplitude of the @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) is then replaced with a generalised distribution amplitude ( gda ) @xcite describing the transition from the @xmath51-pair to @xmath52 , cf .",
    "[ fig : crossing](a ) .",
    "this was noticed in @xcite , and the formal extension of the factorisation proof was given in @xcite .",
    "it is very natural that this should be possible : the hadronisation of a @xmath53-pair into @xmath52 , be it through resonance formation or not , is all long distance physics and can be put into one nonperturbative quantity .",
    "this tells us that the study of spds in this reaction does not require separation of a resonance `` signal '' from a continuum `` background '' , and is in fact not restricted to pion pairs on a resonance peak .",
    "0.85    a gda depends on several variables : @xmath54 the momentum fraction @xmath10 of the quark with respect to the total momentum , just as for an ordinary distribution amplitude , @xmath55 the factorisation scale @xmath56this dependence is given by the same erbl evolution equations describing ordinary distribution amplitudes , @xmath57 the invariant mass @xmath58 of the pion pair , and @xmath59 the polar angle @xmath60 of the @xmath31 in the @xmath52 c.m .",
    "the dependence on @xmath60 can be described via a decomposition into partial waves of the @xmath52 system , and one has two distinct quantum number combinations : even partial waves @xmath61 correspond to states with positive charge conjugation parity @xmath62 , having the quantum numbers of @xmath63-mesons , and the odd ones , @xmath64 to @xmath65 , i.e.  to @xmath46 quantum numbers . in the @xmath46-channel",
    "the asymptotic form of the gda , i.e.  the form one has at very large factorisation scale @xmath56 , has its mass dependence given by the timelike pion form factor @xmath66 , which is well measured from @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this nicely illustrates that , even in the asymptotic regime , there is more than the @xmath46-resonance produced  the pion form factor is not described by a breit - wigner form for the @xmath46 alone .    in electroproduction",
    "pion pairs in both channels can be produced , which implies that there is always some `` contamination '' of @xmath46-production with the `` wrong '' quantum numbers .",
    "the two channels go with different flavour combinations of the spds : @xmath68 with a number of simplifying assumptions one can model the gdas in both channels , and finds that while on the @xmath46 mass peak the @xmath46-channel is clearly dominant , the @xmath63-channel contribution may be visible if @xmath58 is a few 100 mev off peak , provided that @xmath14 is in the valence region so that gluon exchange does not completely dominate over quarks @xcite .",
    "observable signatures of the presence of @xmath63-channel pairs are on one hand a modified angular distribution of the pion pair compared with a pure @xmath69-wave , and in particular the presence of interference terms which are odd under the exchange of @xmath31 and @xmath30 momenta .",
    "another signature of @xmath63-channel pairs is the production of @xmath70-pairs along that of charged pions .    beyond providing an extended description of meson electroproduction the gdas are of interest in themselves , notably because they are related by crossing symmetry to the ( skewed and ordinary ) parton distributions in the pion , cf .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] . the two types of nonperturbative quantities can thus be related by analytic continuation in the invariant mass variable @xmath58 , resp .",
    "@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "finally it is clear that the concept of gdas is not limited to the @xmath47 system , but can be extended e.g.  to kaon pairs , to @xmath71 or to three pions .      as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : fact ] the factorisation theorem states that at sufficiently large @xmath5 longitudinally polarised photons dominate over transverse ones , i.e.  it provides us with a helicity selection rule in the scaling limit .",
    "this is important since the measurement of the azimuthal angle between the electron and hadron planes in @xmath0 contains information about the relative importance of @xmath72 and @xmath73 contributions , i.e.   information on how important power corrections are , in other words how far one is from the asymptotic limit at finite @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that for vector meson production there is a second selection rule , stating that to leading power in @xmath74 only longitudinally polarised mesons are produced @xcite .",
    "it easily generalises to the production of meson pairs : to leading power accuracy the pair has zero angular momentum along its direction of flight in the @xmath75 c.m .",
    "again these selection rules can be tested by measuring angular distributions .    in the existing data on @xmath46-production , both at fixed - target and at collider energies ,",
    "the transition @xmath76 is important : even for values of @xmath5 of 5 to 10 gev@xmath77 the ratio of longitudinal to transverse polarisation is about 2 to 4 at cross section level @xcite .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have also analysed the full angular distributions in @xmath78 and found a hierarchy @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 for those transition amplitudes that are non - zero within experimental accuracy .",
    "power corrections are thus seen to be important , certainly in @xmath46-production .",
    "the physics of these corrections contains several important ingredients . to date most theoretical work has focused on the effect of finite transverse parton momentum in the hard scattering subprocess . in the high - energy regime",
    "several different estimates of this give a fair description of the present hera data on the photon and @xmath46 polarisation @xcite .",
    "note that meson wave functions for finite transverse momentum are related by gauge invariance to wave functions of higher fock states such as @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "higher fock states may thus also play an important role , but no detailed estimation of this has been performed so far .    in the loop integral of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) there is a region where the momentum fraction @xmath10 of the quark in the meson is close to 0 or 1 , so that the quark or antiquark becomes slow and therefore soft .",
    "it has long been realised @xcite that for transverse initial photons such infrared sensitive configurations are not sufficiently suppressed ; this is why the simple factorisation of fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise ] can not be established for a @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "there is an ongoing debate on how serious an infrared - dependence this introduces in the calculation and to what extent meson production from a @xmath73 can be described in a perturbative framework , cf .",
    "for instance @xcite .    closely related with this problem is the question how important soft overlap contributions are relative to the factorising , hard scattering diagrams .",
    "soft overlap contributions can be obtained from diagrams such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion ] by removing the gluon when the quark line that directly connects the meson and the proton is soft .",
    "this is the same physics that is being intensively discussed for elastic form factors and other hard exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "a first attempt to estimate the soft overlap contribution to meson electroproduction has been made in @xcite .",
    "the theory of power corrections is still far from being complete or uncontroversial , and it is important to realise that the various helicity transitions from the photon to the meson ( or mesons ) provide a wealth of observables where such effects can be studied without the need to subtract a leading - twist contribution .      at this point",
    "we have considered several aspects of exclusive meson production , and it might be useful to confront this reaction with deep virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite , looking at which chances and difficulties each of them presents .",
    "it comes out that both processes are very complementary :    @xmath83    unlike compton scattering we always have two unknown non - perturbative quantities in meson production , namely the spds in the target and the meson distribution amplitude ( or gda ) .",
    "while the latter do not contribute to the @xmath14-dependence of the cross section , which is only sensitive to the spds , at least the overall normalisation of the two quantities can not easily be disentangled .",
    "independent information on meson distribution amplitudes is mainly available for the light pseudoscalars , thanks to the measurement of the @xmath84@xmath85 , @xmath84@xmath35 and @xmath84@xmath36 transition form factors .    on the other hand ,",
    "meson production provides a variety of channels , which is extremely helpful to disentangle the various quantities in their flavour and also in their spin decomposition .",
    "compton scattering offers the unique possibility to measure the process at the _ amplitude _ level , through its interference with the bethe - heitler process @xcite .",
    "extracting this information will not be easy , but it may provide the best help one can get on the way towards a deconvolution of the @xmath9-dependence of the spds from the measured cross sections .",
    "notice in this context the different ways in which the spds enter in the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath86 amplitude @xcite .",
    "mechanisms for power corrections are partly different in meson production and compton scattering : in dvcs there is no counterpart to corrections due to the @xmath11 in the meson wave function or to soft overlap contributions , while in meson production one need not worry about the importance of the hadronic , vector - meson type component of the produced photon in dvcs .",
    "expectations are that dvcs may attain the scaling regime for lower values of @xmath5 than meson production processes .",
    "notice also that dvcs is closely related to inclusive deep elastic scattering , represented by the same handbag diagrams with the real photon replaced by a virtual one .",
    "the comparison of the manifestations of higher - twist physics in all these reactions may ultimately help us toward understanding of power corrections .",
    "in addition to quasielastic production @xmath87 one can consider processes where the nucleon @xmath88 is excited , e.g.  into a nucleon resonance @xmath89 or a @xmath90 , or a @xmath91 continuum state with low invariant mass .",
    "being on one hand a background to the quasielastic process these reactions are interesting in themselves : factorisation remains valid as long as the meson ( or meson pairs ) in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise ] and the final state hadrons from the lower part are well separated in phase space .",
    "then one has access to spds describing transitions such as @xmath92 or @xmath93 , on which only little is known so far @xcite .",
    "the question what happens when one replaces the final state nucleon with a continuum state whose invariant mass is _ not _ small leads us to the second part of this review .",
    "let us now look at the process @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a hadronic system with invariant mass @xmath96 above the resonance region , and let us keep the requirement that @xmath95 and @xmath97 be well separated in phase space .",
    "going through the kinematics of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) one finds that for @xmath98 the fractional parton momentum @xmath9 , which was previously to be integrated over all its possible range , becomes `` trapped '' at a particular value ( otherwise one the quarks attached to the soft proton blob in the diagram must go far off - shell ) .",
    "moreover , it becomes trapped at a value for which the photon - parton subdiagrams @xmath12 have internal lines close to their mass - shell .",
    "this means that the `` hard scattering '' is no longer hard , and that to factorise diagrams as it is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : factorise](b ) is no longer the correct way to describe the process .",
    "a way out of this situation is to require a large invariant momentum transfer @xmath3 between the proton and @xmath95 , i.e.  between the photon and @xmath97 .",
    "then the value of @xmath9 where the integration is `` trapped '' no longer corresponds to a singularity of the hard scattering process , which remains under perturbative control .",
    "once we have large @xmath3 we can allow @xmath5 to be small or zero ( and even replace the photon projectile with a hadron , say a pion ) .",
    "this defines then the `` semi - exclusive '' kinematics introduced and studied in @xcite :    @xmath83    @xmath99 ,    @xmath100 so that @xmath95 and @xmath97 are well separated ,    @xmath5 zero , small or large .",
    "0.97    the process can then be calculated in a factorised way , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : semi - excl](a ) .",
    "the upper part of the diagram is the same as for exclusive meson production in the bjorken region , composed of a hard parton - photon scattering and a meson distribution amplitude ( or gda ) , while the lower part has changed .",
    "the reason is that the parton `` coming back '' from the hard scattering has a large transverse momentum compared to the spectator partons in the proton , and therefore hadronises independently from the spectators .",
    "this is precisely the same situation as in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , cf .",
    "[ fig : semi - excl](b ) , so that in the calculation we can treat the scattered parton as a free final - state particle . in",
    "the squared transition amplitude the parton emission from the target is just described by an ordinary ( non - skewed ) parton distribution .",
    "if the target is polarised then one probes the usual helicity - dependent parton distributions .    reminding ourselves that in dis we have a hard scattering on a parton with momentum fraction @xmath101 and making the necessary translation of variables we find that in our semi - exclusive reaction the extracted parton has momentum fraction @xmath102 .",
    "the analogy with dis also indicates that one may invoke parton - hadron duality to use the description of fig .",
    "[ fig : semi - excl](a ) even when the mass @xmath96 is in the resonance region , on the condition of integrating over a sufficiently large @xmath96-range so that individual resonances average out .    at first sight",
    "it may appear that our process is just a special case of a semi-_inclusive _ reaction , the formation of the meson @xmath97 being described by an ordinary fragmentation function with momentum fraction @xmath10 close to 1 .",
    "the example diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : semi - excl](a ) shows that this is not the case : we do not have there a two - step process where a quark from the proton is first scattered off the photon , and then fragments into the meson @xmath97 and some other partons . taking suitable kinematical limits one can however find situations where the close connection between the semi - exclusive and semi - inclusive mechanisms becomes apparent ; such cases have in fact been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "semi - exclusive processes have several features that make them interesting .",
    "let me just mention , but not elaborate on the possibility of investigating large-@xmath3 regge exchange in the context of perturbative qcd .",
    "vector meson production is already being extensively studied under this aspect , both theoretically and experimentally ( cf.@xcite for references ) .",
    "semi - exclusive reactions have a hybrid nature : the upper part of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : semi - excl](a ) is typical of exclusive reactions , and offers a way to study meson distribution amplitudes",
    ". it may be particularly attractive to consider ratios of cross sections , where many details of ( and corrections to ) the calculation cancel out .",
    "the cross section ratio @xmath103 for instance only depends on the distribution amplitudes @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the lower part of the same diagram is reminiscent of usual inclusive or semi - inclusive reactions ; the cross section of our process is linear in the ordinary parton distributions , not quadratic in skewed distributions as the exclusive processes we have discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : excl ] . producing different mesons one can select particular flavour combinations of parton distributions ( in a similar way as in semi - inclusive processes , but without the uncertainties due to `` unfavoured '' fragmentation functions ) .",
    "examples are the ratios @xmath106 and those with @xmath107 , ",
    "one can measure with longitudinal target polarisation .",
    "note that the comparison of @xmath108 with @xmath109 , or @xmath110 with @xmath111 provides valuable information on non - perturbative dynamics in the proton .    to obtain a feeling for accessible values of @xmath112",
    "let us consider some example kinematics for @xmath113 c.m .",

    "luminosity may allow one to go to rather high @xmath3 and thus to access parton distributions at large @xmath9 . for compass energies",
    "there is a comfortable range of @xmath117 and hence of @xmath96 , and one would be able to go down to the @xmath9-region where sea quarks and gluons are important .",
    "exclusive production of mesons in the bjorken region provides an opportunity to study meson distribution amplitudes and skewed parton distributions , and is in several ways complementary to deep virtual compton scattering .",
    "it offers a large variety of channels and thus the possibility to disentangle the many flavour degrees of freedom .",
    "some channels have ( unexpected ) connections to other processes , for instance @xmath31 production with its relation to the elastic pion form factor",
    ".    the spin degrees of freedom of spds can partly be disentangled by comparing different meson channels and dvcs , but full information can only be obtained if the polarisation of the target and/or recoil hadron is measured .",
    "the polarisations of the virtual photon and of the produced meson play a rather different role : they are indicators of how important power corrections are .",
    "this should help us to judge when a leading - twist interpretation of the data is adequate , and beyond this to learn more about non - leading twist physics .",
    "generalised distribution amplitudes open further channels to a factorised description within qcd , with low - mass meson pairs instead of single mesons .",
    "they provide a new way to think about and analyse the production of unstable resonances such as the @xmath46 . by crossing",
    "they are connected to parton distributions in mesons and thus allow one to relate different pieces of information on hadron structure .",
    "semi - exclusive production combines typical features of exclusive and inclusive physics .",
    "next to the possibility to study regge physics in the perturbative region it offers ways to compare different meson distribution amplitudes , and to measure `` exotic '' flavour combinations of unpolarised and polarised parton distributions .    clearly there remains much theoretical work to be done on several of these issues , and much experimental work , too .",
    "the physics potential i have tried to outline will hopefully make these efforts worthwhile .",
