    "this measurement does not show the `` s '' shape of @xmath23 observed in @xcite .",
    "it may be due to a small misalignment along the @xmath74 axis of the sample inside the pressure cell .",
    "the unusual behavior of @xmath76 along the hard axis is related to the field decrease of @xmath1 in the transverse magnetic field and the concomitant reinforcement of the magnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is quite similar to that of the field reentrance of sc in urhge @xcite .",
    "the upward curvature of @xmath76 is reduced under pressure and vanishes around @xmath80  gpa .",

    "the upward curvature disappears when ferromagnetism collapses.@xcite    for @xmath85 , the field and pressure evolution of the inelastic low temperature electronic scattering @xmath61 shows that magnetic fluctuations are strongly suppressed with field .",
    "the relatively low value of @xmath77 and the unusual upward curvature of @xmath77 was explained by several models including a magnetic field dependent pairing interaction  @xcite . in our experiment",
    "the unusual curvature of @xmath86 was observed in the whole pressure range of the superconducting dome . inside the framework of equal spin triplet pairing",
    ", @xmath87 is governed by the orbital effect and so is proportional to @xmath88 . here",
    "we have to account for a field dependence ( @xmath89 ) which reflects a field dependence of the pairing interaction .",
    "the value @xmath90 at finite field is lower than @xmath91 expected from zero magnetic field and this leads to the initial curvature of @xmath12 .",
    "however , at @xmath92gpa far away from the quantum critical region , the ferromagnetic fluctuations have been strongly suppressed and their field dependence become weak . therefore , @xmath93 at @xmath92gpa @xmath94 varies linearly with temperature and is much closer to the conventional orbital limitation with a field independent pairing than @xmath23 in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests , that @xmath94 is driven by the suppression of pairing interaction under field .",
    "to summarize we determined the @xmath14 phase diagram of ucoge up to 10.5@xmath4gpa by resistivity measurements .",
    "@xmath1 vanishes at @xmath39gpa and sc has been observed up to @xmath95 .",
    "ferromagnetic fluctuations account for the unusual normal state transport properties observed up to 5  gpa as well as the pressure and field dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "the superconducting critical field @xmath77 for field along the @xmath10 axis is determined by the pressure and field dependence of the ferromagnetic fluctuations which are suppressed for @xmath96  t at @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath76 for transverse magnetic field changes drastically on crossing the ferromagnetic phase boundary below @xmath3 . entering in the paramagnetic regime above @xmath3 @xmath76 recovers rapidly the conventional initially linear @xmath33 dependence of the upper critical field .",
    "finally , the crossover pressure @xmath8 marks a change in the magnetic and electronic properties linked to the pressure dependence of the 5@xmath19 occupation number and a smooth crossover from a strongly to weakly correlated regime .",
    "our experiment gives now a sound basis on the anisotropic sc response of @xmath23 on the static and dynamic components of the ferromagnetism . to our knowledge",
    ", it is an unique example where the magnetic coupling is deeply modified ( here for @xmath97 ) in low magnetic fields .",
    "close to @xmath3 the comparable strength of @xmath1 and @xmath21 leads to remarkable non - fermi - liquid behavior which indicates the strong coupling of magnetism and superconductivity .",
