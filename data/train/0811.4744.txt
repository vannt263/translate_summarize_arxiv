    "the origin of the generation structure realized in nature is an engrossing subject which has been discussed for a long time , but still remains veiled . within the standard electroweak theory ,",
    "masses and mixing angles of fermions originate from the yukawa interactions with the higgs boson , responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "while , the relative strength of the gauge interactions for various fermion species are controlled by gauge invariance , yukawa couplings are not governed by any principle .",
    "they bring a multitude of free parameters into the theory and even have ambiguities in reconstructing their values from experiments .",
    "a viable approach is , therefore , to search for mass matrices which are taking suggestive forms in light of model building ingredients , such as symmetry amongst generations .",
    "a direct scheme in this spirit is `` texture zero '' in the mass matrices of fermions . in this framework",
    ", it is assumed that the mass matrices have several elements which are anomalously small compared to the others .",
    "initially this approach was studied in the quark sector @xcite and it was found that the existing relations among masses and mixings of quarks can be explained by the vanishing matrix elements .",
    "the available textures presented in the literature provide foundations of model building and insights into the generation puzzle .    as for the lepton sector",
    ", recent progress in neutrino physics makes it possible to discuss feasible forms for mass matrices . in @xcite and many subsequent papers , the texture zeros in lepton sector have been discussed in the context of various types of mass matrices such as the majorana mass matrix of the left - handed neutrinos @xcite , both the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices @xcite , the dirac and the majorana mass matrices in the seesaw mechanism @xcite and amalgamated yukawa couplings in grand unification @xcite .",
    "all these results also provide useful information to infer the structure lying behind the yukawa interactions .",
    "it is to be noted , that , for the mass matrices in the lepton sector , the situation is different from that of the quark sector because of the weak hierarchy of neutrino mass spectrum ( for normal hierarchy ) and two large mixing angles .",
    "in addition , the neutrino spectrum can also have inverted hierarchy and can even be quasi - degenerate which has no analogue in the quark sector .",
    "one of the most distinct features amongst observations in the neutrino sector is the small 1 - 3 angle against possible maximal 2 - 3 mixing .",
    "this is the origin of the @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetric nature of the neutrino mass matrix @xcite . in the generation basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal",
    ", the exact @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetric limit means that there are simple equalities among the matrix elements of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "moreover , the @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetric neutrino mass matrix contains the tri - bimaximal mixing @xcite as a special case , which is obtained by requiring further special relations among the matrix elements .",
    "thus , the equality between the matrix elements might play an important role in understanding the properties of neutrinos and become a simple and direct approach to search for `` suggestive forms '' of the mass textures .",
    "the equalities among left - handed majorana mass matrix elements were discussed in @xcite in a bottom - up way . in @xcite ,",
    "hybrid structures , with the coexistence of equalities among matrix elements and texture zeros for the left - handed majorana mass matrix were studied . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite , but consider the equalities and zeros in the dirac and right - handed majorana mass matrices in the seesaw mechanism .",
    "we perform a thorough classification of such hybrid textures and identify the left - handed majorana mass matrices that can be reconciled with the inputs obtained from neutrino oscillation data . in particular , we consider the case where only two right - handed neutrinos take part in the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "texture analysis in the context of such a minimal seesaw scheme has been accomplished in @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this choice is that there are less number of free parameters .",
    "thus the mass matrices get simple forms and rich predictions compared to the standard three heavy neutrino models . by exhausting all possibilities",
    ", we find a novel class of textures which have only two adjustable parameters to fit the low - energy data .",
    "we discuss the possibility of having leptogenesis in these textures and explore the connection between high and low energy cp violation if any .",
    "the layout of the paper goes as follows . in section 2 , we present the formulations which are needed for the subsequent discussions . in section 3",
    ", we study equalities amongst mass matrix elements and enumerate general possible forms of the mass matrices with equality relations . in section 4",
    ", we perform a combined analysis of equalities and texture zeros and discuss the viable minimal textures which are compatible with the current neutrino data . in section 5 , we discuss cp violation , paying particular attention to possible connections between leptogenesis and cp violation in neutrino oscillation . in section 6 , we briefly comment on the renormalization group effects for the mass matrices .",
    "section 7 is devoted to conclusion and summary .",
    "we assume that the tiny neutrino masses are generated through type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite by the suppression effect of the large mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos . by integrating out the heavy right - handed neutrinos ,",
    "the majorana mass matrix of the left - handed neutrinos is obtained as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the dirac mass matrix after the electroweak symmetry breaking , and @xmath8 is the majorana mass matrix for the right - handed neutrinos . in this paper , we consider the case where we have only two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "accordingly , the dirac mass matrix @xmath7 is a @xmath9 rectangular matrix , while @xmath8 is given by a @xmath10 symmetric matrix .",
    "it is noteworthy that the two generations of fermions are matched well with the idea of the doublet ( irreducible representation ) of discrete groups , which have recently been utilized to address the observed lepton mixings and masses .",
    "the mixing matrix in the lepton sector , the so - called pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath11 can be defined as the unitary matrix which diagonalizes the left - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath12 in the generation basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the neutrino oscillation experiments are capable of determining the squared mass differences @xmath15 and the three mixing angles and one cp violating phase in @xmath11 .",
    "we parameterize the pmns matrix @xmath11 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the phase @xmath21 represents one phase degree of freedom which is responsible for cp violation phenomena at low - energy , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the majorana phases .",
    "@xmath24 is a diagonal phase matrix which is to be removed by the redefinition of the left - handed fields .",
    "so far , oscillation experiments have determined the two mass squared differences and the two angles , and have provided an upper bound on the third mixing angle @xmath25 .",
    "the three generation analysis of the current data suggests    .the present best - fit values and the 3@xmath23 ranges of oscillation parameters from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      let us first discuss the solution i ; @xmath26 after the seesaw mechanism , the majorana mass matrix for the left - handed neutrinos becomes @xmath27 where we introduce the parameter @xmath28 and @xmath29 to simplify the notation .",
    "note that this matrix obeys the so called scaling property between the second and third rows and second and third columns @xcite .",
    "this matrix has @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry and a zero eigenvalue such that the mass ordering is predicted to be inverted .",
    "moreover , the reactor and the atmospheric angles are given as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "a nontrivial consequence of this solution is thus the relation between masses and the solar angle .",
    "the two nonzero eigenvalues are @xmath32 we find that these eigenvalues should be identified as @xmath33 and @xmath34 in order to fit the observations .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are therefore fixed in terms of the two mass differences as @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "here we are taking a combination of the solutions which is viable with the solar neutrino observations .",
    "the solar angle is also fixed by the two mass differences .",
    "it is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 by expanding ( [ sin12 ] ) in powers of @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 it is interesting to observe that , in the 0-th order , the solar mixing angle is predicted to be @xmath43 , which is the same as in the tri - bimaximal mixing scenario .",
    "in fact , the whole mixing matrix @xmath11 can be written as @xmath44 up to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , this is given by the tri - bimaximal mixing matrix multiplied by the small correction matrix .",
    "this type of lepton mixing is naturally realized by a class of flavor models which utilize the scherk - schwarz twisted boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it might be interesting to study this type of deviation from the tri - bimaximal mixing and its implication for future neutrino experiments systematically .",
    "the effective neutrino mass @xmath46 which is responsible for the neutrino - less double beta decay is given by the element @xmath35 itself .",
    "thus in this texture we find @xmath46 is predicted as @xmath47 at the best fit of the mass difference . with this value , neutrino - less double beta decay may be detectable in forthcoming experiments .",
    "since there are only two mixing angles in @xmath11 , cp must be conserved at low energy . however , at high energy there is one unremovable phase which can violate cp .",
    "such cp violation is conveniently measured by the weak basis invariant @xmath48 $ ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xcite . for the texture",
    "i , we find @xmath51 in the basis where only @xmath52 is complex ; @xmath53 .",
    "the leptogenesis @xcite is thus possible , with the lepton asymmetry proportional to this quantity .",
    "next we discuss the solution ii ; @xmath54 after the seesaw mechanism , the majorana mass matrix for the left - handed neutrinos becomes @xmath55 where we define @xmath56 and @xmath57 to simplify the notation .",
    "as in the previous case , this matrix also has @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry and a zero eigenvalues .",
    "the mass hierarchy is thus predicted as inverted ordering , and the reactor and the atmospheric angles are given as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the two nonzero eigenvalues are @xmath58 we find that these eigenvalues should be identified as @xmath33 and @xmath34 in order to fit the observations . a solution of this equation system is found to be @xmath59 here we show approximate expressions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 because the exact expressions are too long and complicated to present here .",
    "the solar angle is also fixed by the two mass differences .",
    "it is written in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the mass differences as @xmath62 we can see that the prediction for the solar angle agrees with the current @xmath63 range although it is close to its lower bound .    the averaged neutrino mass @xmath46 which is responsible for the neutrino - less double beta decay is given by @xmath64 in this case .",
    "we find @xmath46 is predicted as @xmath47 at the best fit of the mass difference and a signal can be expected in future we have a slightly better chance to detect neutrino - less double beta decay measurements .",
    "cp violation is possible at high - energy as the weak - basis invariant @xmath65 is non - vanishing .",
    "in fact , it becomes @xmath66 in the basis where only @xmath67 is complex ; @xmath68 . on the other hand ,",
    "no cp violation occurs in the neutrino oscillation because of the vanishing @xmath25 .",
    "finally let us discuss the solution iii .",
    "the viable texture is given by @xmath69 after the seesaw mechanism , the majorana mass matrix for the left - handed neutrinos becomes @xmath70 where we introduce the parameter @xmath71 and @xmath72 to simplify the notation .",
    "this has one zero element in the final matrix and has been discussed in @xcite . unlike the two solutions found in the previous subsection , there is no @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry in ( [ miii ] ) . therefore the reactor and the atmospheric angles no longer satisfy @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and all nonzero values of the mixing angles can be described as functions of the mass differences .",
    "we note that , because of the lack of the @xmath4-@xmath5 symmetry , there appears an additional solution in this case .",
    "namely , the @xmath7 which is obtained by 2 - 3 column exchange of ( [ soliii ] ) can also be compatible with the data . although these two solutions are independent in the sense that they are not related to each other by basis rotations , their physical consequences are almost the same .",
    "we thus discuss only ( [ soliii ] ) to illustrate important features of these solutions .",
    "the two nonzero eigenvalues of ( [ miii ] ) are @xmath73 we find that these eigenvalues should be identified as @xmath74 and @xmath75 in order to fit the observations . the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 are therefore fixed in terms of the two mass differences . however , the exact expressions are too long and complicated and it is not appropriate to present them here . instead ,",
    "we shall approximate them in powers of @xmath41 ; @xmath76 here we are picking up a combination of the solutions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which gives the correct mixing angles .",
    "note that we represent the leading and the first order coefficients by decimal numbers .",
    "these terms can also be represented as functions of integers as in ( [ abii ] ) , but the expressions are not so simple as in the case of the other two solutions .",
    "the three angles are also fixed by the two mass differences .",
    "they are given by @xmath77 here we note again that the decimals in the above expressions represent definite irrational numbers which are too long and complicated to be presented in closed form .",
    "it is interesting that the predictions for @xmath78 and @xmath79 are very close to the current best fit values indicated in table 1 .",
    "we see that this texture predicts a relatively large @xmath25 which can be measured in forthcoming experiments like double - chooz .",
    "the effective neutrino mass @xmath46 which is responsible for the neutrino - less double beta decay is given by @xmath80 and is predicted as @xmath47 at the best fit of the mass difference .",
    "thus , neutrino - less double beta decay will be detectable in forthcoming experiments .",
    "finally we comment on cp violation . since @xmath25 is nonzero with the solution iii",
    ", one might expect that there exists corelation between cp violation phenomena at high and low - energy scale . however , this is not the case .",
    "the invariant measure @xmath65 is given by @xmath81/|b|^4 $ ] , but @xmath82 is real valued for the @xmath7 in ( [ soliii ] ) .",
    "thus the leptogenesis does not occur with the solution iii . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase @xmath21 in the pmns matrix is not vanishing . the cp violation caused by @xmath21",
    "can be conveniently described with , for example , @xmath83 ^ 3 $ ] , where @xmath84 is the charged - lepton mass matrix @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen that the basis - independent quantity @xmath85 takes the form @xmath86 +   c_2 \\cdot { \\rm im}\\big [ a^2 b^*{}^2 \\big]$ ] , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are nonzero real values , and @xmath85 is therefore nonzero in general .",
    "to summarize , with the solution iii , cp violation in the oscillation can be measured , while leptogenesis is not possible .",
    "interestingly , the three solutions i , ii and iii are consistent only with the inverted mass ordering for neutrino mass spectrum . from this fact ,",
    "we conclude that the hybrid property prefers the inverted hierarchy .",
    "however , there exist three quasi viable textures iv , v and vi with normal hierarchy .",
    "we call them quasi - viable as certain predictions of these textures are marginally consistent with the @xmath63 range presented in table 1 , this can be seen , for example , with v and vi in which the element @xmath89 is vanishing . as a general consequence of @xmath90 and",
    "the normal hierarchy with @xmath91 , the solar and reactor angles correlate with @xmath41 as @xmath92 .",
    "this relation needs small @xmath78 and @xmath41 , and large ( just below the current @xmath63 bound ) @xmath25 .    with the solutions",
    "iv and v , there are is no cp violating phase for the right - handed mass matrix since the heavy neutrino are degenerate in mass .",
    "such degeneracy can be relaxed by some corrections , for example , renormalization group evolution from the texture scale ( at which the textures are assumed ) down to the right - handed neutrino scale . however , even with relaxations of the degeneracy , the lepton asymmetries for iv and v are small because the off - diagonal components of @xmath93 are real valued .",
    "it may be possible to generate a non - zero value for this by introducing two - loop renormalization group effects @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not consider these effects .    on the other hand , we have nonzero @xmath65 and @xmath85 within the solution vi . therefore the texture vi can give rise to a connection between leptogenesis and cp violation in neutrino oscillation .",
    "we discuss this connection in detail in the next section .",
    "with the solution vi , both @xmath65 and @xmath85 are non - vanishing , and there is a correlation between cp violation phenomena at high and low - energy scales .",
    "it is interesting if we can predict the amount of cp violation at low energy in terms of the phase of the yukawa coupling responsible for successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis . in this section",
    ", we address this issue and study the connection between leptogenesis and cp violation at low energy with the interesting example of the solution vi .    to perform this program , it is convenient to parameterize the dirac mass matrix @xmath7 as @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 are positive - real parameters , and @xmath96 is an unitary matrix which contains only one dirac type phase ( conveniently parameterized as ( [ pmns ] ) without majorana phases ) , and @xmath97 is a diagonal phase matrix . taking account of the texture zeros and equalities in @xmath7 of the solution vi , the general form ( [ sahu ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "therefore ( [ sahu2 ] ) contains two real parameter @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and one phase @xmath104 , as it should do . with the parameterization ( [ sahu2 ] ) ,",
    "the seesaw formula is written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a complex - symmetric @xmath107 matrix of @xmath108 , but it has nonzero elements only in the lower - right @xmath10 block .",
    "this is an advantage of the form ( [ sahu ] ) because diagonalization of a @xmath109 matrix is significantly easier than @xmath110 case .",
    "the pmns matrix is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a unitary matrix which diagonalize @xmath106 such that @xmath113 .",
    "we should identify the two mass eigenvalues @xmath114 as @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the eigenvalue of @xmath118 which is a function of @xmath119 and @xmath104 .",
    "thus the mass ratio @xmath120 gives a constraint on the @xmath119-@xmath104 space . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall scale of the neutrino mass gives a relation between @xmath102 and @xmath121 as @xmath122 .",
    "the three angle and the mass ratio @xmath41 are controlled by only two parameters @xmath119 and @xmath104 .",
    "since the analytic expressions for the low - energy observables are complicated , we check the constraints on @xmath104-@xmath119 space numerically . fig .",
    "[ range ] shows the allowed region on @xmath104-@xmath119 plane .",
    "the upper(lower ) green(solid ) curves are the @xmath63 lower(upper ) bound of the ratio @xmath41 , which are obtained from @xmath120 .",
    "more important constraints come from the reactor bound @xmath123 and the lower bound of the solar angle @xmath124 , which are shown by red(dotted ) and blue(dashed ) curves respectively .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath78 get increased as @xmath119 increases , so that the shaded region remains allowed by the current oscillation data .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath78 draws a curve above the shaded region and it does not reduce the allowed space . in the following , we fix @xmath125 to assess maximal impact on the low - energy cp violation . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the possible range of the phase @xmath104 is @xmath126 . with these parameters ,",
    "the three mixing angles are predicted as @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the dirac type phase @xmath21 in @xmath11 can be measured in long - baseline experiments @xcite .",

    "@xmath133 is bounded as @xmath134 for @xmath126 .",
    "the cp asymmetry @xmath135 with the heavy neutrino decay ( lighter one ) is given by @xmath136 } { ( \\bar{m}_d^ * \\bar{m}_d^{\\rm t})_{11}v^2 } \\cdot f \\ ! \\left(\\frac{m_2 ^",

    "the right - handed neutrino masses are denoted by @xmath139 and @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we neglect the contribution from the self - energy diagram which is small compared to the vertex one for the heavy neutrino scale of @xmath143 in hierarchical case . in the above , the dirac mass matrix @xmath144 is in the basis where @xmath8 is diagonal .",
    "the baryon - to - photon ratio is given by @xmath145 where the factor @xmath146 represents the sphaleron conversion and the dilution due to the photon productions from the onset of leptogenesis until recombination .",
    "the factor @xmath147 is the final efficiency factor which we are taking @xmath148 in this case .",
    "[ jcpetab ] shows @xmath149 and @xmath133 as a parametric plot with respect to @xmath104 .",
    "we put details about the plot in the caption .",
    "we can see a sharp correlation between @xmath149 and @xmath133 .",
    "in particular , the sign of @xmath150 is predicted to be negative ; the disappearance probability of the anti - neutrino @xmath151 will be observed greater than that of the ordinary @xmath152 .",
    "it is also clear that there is a lower bound of the mass scale @xmath153 as @xmath154 .",
    "if the cp violation @xmath155 is measured , then it is an indirect measurement of the right - handed mass scale under the assumption that the leptogenesis is solely responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it is to be noted that the majorana mass matrices obtained through seesaw diagonalization are implicitly at some high scale which depends on the mass of the heavy neutrinos . consequently the mixing angles and the mass eigenvalues are the corresponding quantities at the high scale . to obtain the values at the low scale ,",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) induced running effects need to be incorporated @xcite .",
    "impact of rg running with tri - bimaximal mixing at high scale has been considered in @xcite .",
    "it was found that these effects are typically small for hierarchical spectrum .",
    "considerable running can be possible for quasi - degenerate neutrinos depending on the values of majorana phases @xcite .",
    "however since the rg induced corrections to the mass matrix elements are multiplicative in nature it is expected that a zero in the mass matrix @xmath156 will remain a zero @xcite . it is also shown in @xcite that a mass matrix obeying scaling properties are stable against rg corrections .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the textures which we find as allowed will be stable against rg corrections .",
    "however it is possible that certain textures which are disallowed marginally may get allowed if one included rg effects . in this paper",
    "we do not attempt to classify such textures .",
    "renormalization effects for texture zero mass matrices have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite discussed radiative generation and stability of texture zeros in the context of type - i seesaw models for running from low to high scale and reached the same conclusion that the rg effects can not make an allowed texture forbidden but the converse may be possible .",
    "thus we do not expect the allowed patterns to get excluded by rg effects .",
    "in this work we consider simultaneous presence of equalities and texture zeros in the elements of dirac and majorana mass matrices in the context of the minimal seesaw model containing two heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it is well known that because of the symmetric nature of the majorana mass matrix ( @xmath8 ) the off - diagonal elements are equal . in the present study",
    ", we impose additional equalities among the elements of the majorana mass matrix as well as on the elements of the dirac mass matrix ( @xmath7 ) at some high scale .",
    "equalities among matrix elements of neutrino mass matrices can arise for example due to @xmath4-@xmath5 exchange symmetry which predicts @xmath25=0 and @xmath157 in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "such equalities reduce the number of free parameters in the theory and hence increase its predictive power . another way to reduce the number of free parameters",
    "is the postulation of texture zeros which can also be motivated by certain class of flavor symmetries in the mass matrix .",
    "we classify and enumerate the general possibilities of mass matrices with equalities among elements .",
    "then we perform a hybrid texture analysis combining both equalities and zeros .",
    "our aim is to identify the left - handed majorana mass matrices obtained by seesaw diagonalization , that are compatible with the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we study a large number of independent options ( more than 400 ) and find that at the level of minimal number of free parameters ( _ i.e. _ with maximum number of conditions imposed on the elements of the dirac and majorana mass matrices ) , only 6 textures stand out to be consistent with global neutrino oscillation data .",
    "these 6 patterns , presented in table 2 are thus , quite special and rare from the point of view of the parameter sets realized in nature .",
    "these textures are characterized by two free parameters ( ignoring the phases ) so that there exist 3 relations among 5 oscillation parameters in each solution .",
    "we formulate these relations by taking the two mass squared differences as input and 3 mixing angles as output parameters . in two out of the three cases",
    "the elements of the pmns matrix are found to be given by irrational but simple algebraic numbers , to the leading order in the small parameter @xmath158 .",
    "all the six solutions in table 2 have one physical phase .",
    "we study the the possibility of obtaining leptogenesis in these models and explore if there is any connection between the phase responsible for generation of lepton asymmetry and the low energy cp phase .",
    "we find that there is only one solution in which a connection between leptogenesis and low energy cp violation is possible ignoring radiative effects .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the first 3 solutions in table 2 are consistent with the data only with the inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "a priori , there is no reason that some texture must belong to a particular hierarchy .",
    "the basic principles which we take are the equalities among matrix elements , texture zeros and minimality of the parameters .",
    "thus we conclude that the minimal seesaw mechanism prefers the inverted hierarchy under the constraints which are likely to stem from physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in fact , many authors have tried to explain the generation structure invoking discrete or other symmetries , where the equalities and vanishing elements in yukawa couplings are often realized as direct consequences of imposed flavor symmetries or secondary products of model constructions @xcite .",
    "while the inverted hierarchy seems somewhat special in the sense that it shows sharp contrast to all the other fermions , the nature seems to be open to the inverted hierarchy in the context of hybrid texture .",

    "in this appendix , we show the detailed classification of the dirac mass matrix @xmath7 . since @xmath7 has six entries , we can impose equalities on @xmath7 up to five .",
    "we shall start with 1 equality in @xmath7 . by imposing 1 equality among 6 matrix elements ,",
    "the 6 elements are divided into 5 groups , that is , for instance @xmath159 , and other 4 matrix elements .",
    "this situation can be symbolized by @xmath160 , where each entry means the `` slot '' of the independent parameter .",
    "since we impose 1 equality among 6 elements , the number of the independent parameters is reduced to 5 .",
    "therefore we have 5 entries in @xmath160 .",
    "the number of each entry in the first bracket denotes the number of the matrix elements included in each group .",

    "the representatives are @xmath165 all 45 patterns can be generated from these 9 patterns . it should be noted again that we regard the textures which is related by the label exchange of the first two entries of ( 2,2,1,1 ) as identical .",
    "the classification of the above 9 patterns is similar to the general possibilities for the 2 zero textures for @xmath7 .",
    "we have @xmath166 general possibilities and three representatives in this category . @xmath167",
    "all 20 patterns can be generated from these 3 patterns . an easy way to understand these 3 patterns comes from the analogy with the 3 zero textures in @xmath7 .",
    "here we consider 3 equalities in @xmath7 .",
    "since we have 3 equalities , the matrix elements are divided into 3 groups .",
    "there are three types of distributions ; ( 3,2,1 ) , ( 4,1,1 ) and ( 2,2,2 ) .",
    "let us see in turn .",
    "there are @xmath163 patterns in this category .",
    "it is helpful to remember the case of ( 2,2,1,1 ) in 2 equalities . this case",
    "is obtained by imposing equalities between the last two entries of ( 2,2,1,1 ) . as in the case of ( 2,2,1,1 ) , we should identify the three entries of ( 2,2,2 ) .",
    "then the total number is reduced to @xmath172 patterns .",
    "the representatives are given by @xmath173 all 15 textures are generated from the above 5 representatives by the exchange of the rows and the columns .",
    "there are @xmath177 patterns of textures in this case .",
    "however 20 patterns contain redundancy .",
    "we can reproduce all 20 patterns from fundamental 10 patterns by exchanging the two entries of ( 3,3 ) .",
    "the 10 patterns can be obtained from the three representatives .",
    "they can be taken as @xmath178 all 10 textures are generated from the above 3 representatives by the exchange of the rows and the columns .      in this case , all the matrix elements in @xmath7 are equal and the resultant left - handed majorana mass matrix is of democratic form .",
    "this provides two massless neutrinos together with a nonzero @xmath8 .",
    "thus we can exclude @xmath7 with 5 equalities .",
