    "nowadays , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been established as the fundamental gauge theory of the strong interaction .",
    "however , nonperturbative properties of low - energy qcd such as color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite are not yet well understood , which gives one of the most difficult problems in theoretical physics .",
    "the nonperturbative qcd has been studied in lattice qcd @xcite and various analytical frameworks @xcite .    in particular",
    ", it is rather interesting and important to examine the correlation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , since the direct relation is not yet shown between them in qcd .",
    "the strong correlation between them has been suggested by the almost simultaneous phase transitions of deconfinement and chiral restoration in lattice qcd both at finite temperature @xcite and in a small - volume box @xcite .    the close relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking has been also suggested in terms of the monopole degrees of freedom @xcite . here",
    ", the monopole topologically appears in qcd by taking the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite .",
    "for example , by removing the monopoles in the ma gauge , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are simultaneously lost in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "( the instantons also disappear without monopoles @xcite . )",
    "this indicates an important role of the monopole to both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , and these two nonperturbative qcd phenomena seem to be related via the monopole .",
    "however , as a possibility , removing the monopoles may be `` too fatal '' for most nonperturbative properties .",
    "if this is the case , nonperturbative qcd phenomena are simultaneously lost by their cut .",
    "in fact , there remains an important question : _ if only the relevant ingredient of chiral symmetry breaking is carefully removed , how will be confinement in qcd ?",
    "_ in this paper , considering this question , we perform a direct investigation between color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in lattice qcd , using the dirac - mode expansion in a gauge - invariant manner @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "in sec.ii , we introduce the gauge - invariant formalism with the dirac - mode expansion . in sec.iii , we present the operator formalism in lattice qcd . in sec.iv , we formulate the dirac - mode expansion and projection . in sec.v",
    ", we show the lattice results on the analysis of confinement in terms of the dirac modes in qcd .",
    "section vi is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "we newly develop a manifestly gauge - covariant expansion of the qcd operator such as the wilson loop , using the eigen - mode of the qcd dirac operator @xmath0 , and investigate the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .      in the previous studies",
    "@xcite , we investigated the relevant gluon - momentum region for confinement in lattice qcd , and found that the string tension @xmath4 , i.e. , the confining force , is almost unchanged even after removing the high - momentum gluon component above 1.5gev in the landau gauge .",
    "in fact , the confinement property originates from the low - momentum gluon component below 1.5gev , which is the upper limit to contribute to @xmath4 .",
    "the previous study on the relevant gluonic modes was based on the fourier expansion , i.e. , the eigen - mode expansion of the momentum operator @xmath5 .",
    "because of the commutable nature of @xmath6=0 $ ] , all the momentum @xmath5 can be simultaneously diagonalized , which is one of the strong merits of the fourier expansion .",
    "also it keeps lorentz covariance .",
    "however , the fourier expansion does _ not _ keep gauge invariance in gauge theories .",
    "therefore , for the use of the fourier expansion in qcd , one has to select a suitable gauge such as the landau gauge @xcite , where the gauge - field fluctuation is strongly suppressed in euclidean qcd .    as a next challenge ,",
    "we consider a gauge - invariant method , using a gauge - covariant expansion in qcd instead of the fourier expansion .",
    "in fact , we consider a generalization of the fourier expansion or an alternative expansion with keeping the gauge symmetry .",
    "a straight generalization is to use the covariant derivative operator @xmath7 instead of the derivative operator @xmath8 .",
    "however , due to the non - commutable nature of @xmath9 \\ne 0 $ ] , one can not diagonalize all the covariant derivative @xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) simultaneously , but only one of them can be diagonalized .",
    "for example , the eigen - mode expansion of @xmath11 keeps gauge covariance and is rather interesting , but this type of expansion inevitably breaks the lorentz covariance .",
    "then , we consider the eigen - mode expansion of the dirac operator @xmath12 or @xmath13 @xcite , since such an expansion keeps both gauge symmetry and lorentz covariance .    in particular , the dirac - mode expansion is rather interesting because the dirac operator @xmath14 directly connects with chiral symmetry breaking via the banks - casher relation @xcite and its zero modes are related to the topological charge via the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite . here",
    ", we mainly consider the manifestly gauge - invariant new method using the dirac - mode expansion .",
    "thus , the dirac - mode expansion has some important merits :    * the dirac - mode expansion method manifestly keeps both gauge and lorentz invariance .",
    "* each qcd phenomenon can be directly investigated in terms of chiral symmetry breaking .",

    ", the area - law behavior of the wilson loop and the slope parameter @xmath133 are found to be almost unchanged by the im - cut of the dirac modes .",
    "thus , from the above lattice qcd results , we conclude that there is no specific region of the dirac modes responsible to the confinement in qcd , unlike the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "instead , we conjecture that the `` seed '' of confinement is distributed not only in low - lying dirac modes but also in a wider region of the dirac - mode space .",
    "we have developed a manifestly gauge - covariant expansion and projection using the eigen - mode of the qcd dirac operator @xmath0 . with this method , we have performed a direct investigation of correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in su(3 ) lattice qcd on the @xmath1 periodic lattice at @xmath2=5.6 at the quenched level .",
    "we have found that the wilson loop remains to obey the area law , and the slope parameter corresponding to the string tension or the confinement force is almost unchanged , even after removing the low - lying dirac modes , which are responsible to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we have also found that the polyakov loop remains to be almost zero even without the low - lying dirac modes , which indicates the @xmath3-unbroken confinement phase .",
    "these results indicate that one - to - one correspondence does not hold for between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .    as a caution",
    ", we have used a coarse and small lattice , because of the technical difficulty to diagonalize the full dirac operator . in particular , the box size of our lattice volume",
    "is about 1.5fm .",
    "in fact , to be strict , this region we survey is the intermediate distance , of which confining behavior is rather important for the quark - hadron physics . to obtain more definite conclusion , especially on the asymptotic confining behavior of the potential",
    ", it is desired to perform larger - volume lattice qcd calculations and to cut various wider region of the dirac modes , although it is technically quite difficult .",
    "our strategy is to investigate the relation between the nonperturbative properties of qcd , by extracting or removing the essence of chiral symmetry breaking . this is similar to the demonstration of abelian / monopole dominance @xcite or center / vortex dominance @xcite for nonperturbative properties .",
    "however , while the previous scenario has been done in a specific gauge , our new method is manifestly gauge - invariant . in this analysis ,",
    "we have carefully amputated only the `` essence of chiral symmetry breaking '' by cutting off the low - lying dirac modes .",
    "then , we have artificially realized the `` confined but chiral restored situation '' in qcd .",
    "recently , lang and schrock studied the hadron spectra after the cut of the low - lying dirac modes @xcite .",
    "since the quark propagator is directly expressed with the dirac operator @xmath14 , the dirac - mode projection is straightforward , and complicated projection procedure is not necessary in such studies . in their study , although the confinement was not checked , the appearance of hadronic spectra seems to suggest the existence of the confinement force , even after cutting the low - lying dirac modes .",
    "next , we comment on the possible relation among confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , and monopoles in qcd .",
    "there is a close relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking through the monopoles in the ma gauge @xcite .",
    "the monopole would be essential degrees of freedom for most nonperturbative qcd : confinement @xcite , chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , and instantons @xcite .",
    "in fact , removing the monopole would be `` too fatal '' for the nonperturbative properties , so that nonperturbative qcd phenomena are simultaneously lost by their cut .",
    "on the approximate coincidence of the critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral restoration , a large change of monopoles may lead to both phase transitions @xcite , since the global connection of the monopole current seems to be largely changed around the qcd phase transition @xcite .    as for the recent finite - temperature qcd analysis ,",
    "a lattice qcd group has reported a certain difference between the `` critical temperatures '' of deconfinement and chiral restoration , which are determined by the susceptibility peak of the polyakov loop and chiral condensate , respectively @xcite .",
    "this may be also an indirect evidence of `` confinement @xmath201 chiral symmetry breaking '' in qcd .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the role of low - lying dirac modes in the viewpoint of instantons in qcd .",
    "the dirac zero - mode associated with an instanton is localized around it @xcite .",
    "the localized objects are hard to contribute to the large - distance phenomenon of confinement , although such low - lying dirac modes contribute to chiral symmetry breaking . recall that instantons contribute to chiral symmetry breaking , but do not directly lead to confinement @xcite . then , as a thought experiment , if only instantons can be carefully removed from the qcd vacuum , confinement properties would be almost unchanged , but the chiral condensate is largely reduced , and accordingly some low - lying dirac modes disappear .",
    "thus , in this case , confinement is almost unchanged , in spite of the large reduction of low - lying dirac modes .",
    "if the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking is not one - to - one in qcd , richer phase structure is expected in qcd .",
    "for example , the phase transition point can be different between deconfinement and chiral restoration in the presence of strong electro - magnetic fields , because of their nontrivial effect on chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the similar analysis at finite temperatures in lattice qcd .",
    "the full qcd calculation in this direction is also an interesting subject .",
