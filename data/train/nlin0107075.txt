    "in this article we study volume preserving diffeomorphic integrable hierarchy of three flows  [ 1 ] . this is different from the usual two flows cases , and this can be studied via nambu - poisson geometry .",

    "nambu mechanics is a generalization of classical hamiltonian mechanics , introduced by yoichiro nambu  [ 3 ] . at the begining he wanted to formulate a statistical mechanics on @xmath0 , emphasizing that the only feature of hamiltonian mechanics one should preserve is the liouville theorem .",
    "he considered the following equations of motion @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are dynamical variables and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are two functions of @xmath7 .",
    "then liouville theorem follows from the identity @xmath8    he further observed from above equation that the evolution of a function on @xmath0 is given by @xmath9 where the right hand side is the jacobian of the mapping @xmath10 given by @xmath11 the right hand side can be interpreted as a generalized poisson bracket .",
    "hence the binary operation of poisson bracket of hamiltonian mechanics is generalized to @xmath12-ary operation in nambu mechanics .",
    "recently takhtajan  [ 4 ,  5 ] has formulated its basic principles in an invariant geometrical form similar to that of hamiltonian mechanics .    in this paper",
    ", we shall use nambu mechanics to study generalized volume preserving diffeomorphic integrable hierarchy .",
    "these classes of integrable systems are closely related to the self dual einstein equation , dispersionless kp equations etc .",
    "in fact we obtain a higher dimensional analogue of all these systems .",
    "it turns out that all these systems can be written in the following form : @xmath13 for @xmath14 we obtain all the self dual einstein and dkp type equations .",
    "hence we obtain a common structure behind all these integrable system , so there is a consistent and coherent way to describe all these systems .",
    "here we unify all these classes of integrable systems by gindikin s pencil or bundle of forms and riemann  hilbert problem ( twistor description ) .",

    "the function @xmath23 is called orlov function and it is defined by @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "[ remark:1 ] our hierarchy has a structure of volume preserving kp hierarchy and instead of one orlov function @xmath23 , we need two orlov functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "any two equations of the hierarchy commute @xmath137 hence we obtain    [ proposition:1 ] the lax equation for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are equivalent to the following equations : @xmath138 where @xmath139    result follows from the compatibility conditions of hierarchy equations and the fundamental identity .",

    "in fact sdiff@xmath142 structure is clearly exhibited from this structure and the theory is integrable in the sense of nonlinear graviton construction  [ 14 ] . this is a generalization of nonlinear graviton construction .",

    "we multiply the above three equations by @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively . if we add first and third equations and substract the second one from them , then after using the volume preserving identity we obtain @xmath157",
    "similarly we can obtain the other equations also , in that case we will multiply the equations ( [ guha:21 ] ) , ( [ guha:22 ] ) and ( [ guha:23 ] ) by @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively .",
    "equation ( [ guha:25 ] ) and ( [ guha:26 ] ) , we obtain @xmath161    this implies the existence of one form @xmath162 such that @xmath163    this is an analogue of `` krichever potential '' in the volume preserving case .",
    "hence we can say from ( [ guha:24 ] ) @xmath164",
    "we already stated that our situation is quite similar to nonlinear graviton construction of penrose  [ 17 ] for the self dual einstein equation .",

    "this set up is nothing but the riemann ",
    "hilbert problem in area preserving diffeomorphism case .",
    "the novelty of this approach is that this twistor construction will work in the higher dimensions too , when there is no twistor projection .",
    "the most important example is the electro - vacuum equation , volume preserving diffeomorphism groups in three dimension play a vital role here .",
    "this model was first introduced by flaherty  [ 18 ] and later takasaki  [ 2 ] showed how this works explicitly .",
    "we already stated that anti - self dual vacuum equations govern the behaviour of complex 4-metrics of signature @xmath182 whose ricci curvature is zero and whose weyl curvature is self dual .",
    "these two curvatures are independent of change of coordinates , so in one particular of the equations these metric becomes autometically khler and can be expressed in terms of a single scalar function @xmath24 , the khler potential .",
    "then curvarure conditions will lead you to ist plebenski s heavenly equation @xmath183 or using the poisson bracket ( w.r.t @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xmath184 and the correspoding anti - self - dual ricci flat metric is @xmath185    this system is completely integrable and it is an example of a multidimensional integrable system .",

    "a number of multidimensional integrable systems can be written in terms of a 2-form @xmath24 which satisfies the equations ( [ guha:34 ] ) .",

    "[ proposition:2 ] the 3-form @xmath198 satisfies @xmath199    this is equivalent to propostion  [ proposition:1 ] , hence it is satisfied .    the gindikin s method [ 19 ] of pencil of 2-forms is the most effective way to study these systems .",
