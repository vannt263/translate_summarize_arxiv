    "not only hold for functions on the natural numbers , but also for the computation of operators on such functions .",
    "a natural topology can be defined on such spaces with respect to which computable operators turn out to be ( effectively ) continuous .",
    "if one restricts one s interest to functions which are computable and can therefore be presented by the programs computing them ( or their codings ) , there is another way of specifying the computability of operators : an operator is _ effective _ if it is tracked by a computable function on the code .",
    "the continuity problem is the question whether effective operators are the restrictions ( to computable inputs ) of ( effectively ) continuous operators .",
    "obviously , both approaches are rather unconnected . nevertheless for certain important cases positive solutions were presented : in the case of operators on the partial computable functions this is due to myhill and shepherdson ( 1955 ) ; in the case of the total computable functions to kreisel , lacombe and shoenfield ( 1959 ) . in the first case the result has been generalised to certain types of directed - complete partial orders with the scott topology ( cf .",
    "e.g.   @xcite ) , in the other to separable metric spaces @xcite .",
    "these two types of spaces are quite different , not only topologically : they also offer different algorithmic techniques to use . as follows from an example by friedberg ( 1958 ) ,",
    "effective operators are not continuous , in general .",
    "the situation remained unclear for quite a while .",
    "spreen and young ( 1984 ) showed that for second - countable topological @xmath0 spaces effective maps are effectively continuous if they have a witness for noninclusion .",
    "the requirement says that if the image of a basic open set under the operator is not included in a given basic open set in its co - domain , then one needs be able to effectively produce a witness for this .",
    "later , in @xcite , a mathematically more civilized framework for the derivation of this result was developed .",
    "the condition seems natural when dealing with continuity . in the present note",
    "we will give even more evidence for its canonicity .",
    "in classical topology it is well known that for second - countable spaces sequentially continuous maps are continuous .",
    "the proof can be transferred into a constructive framework .",
    "there is however one step in which the classical proof uses the axiom of choice and the effective information needed here is exactly what is provided by the witness for noninclusion condition .",
    "so , the question comes up whether effective operators are effectively sequentially continuous and the extra condition is only needed for the step from effective sequential continuity to effective continuity .",
    "we will show for a large class of spaces that effective operators are effectively sequentially continuous . to this end",
    "we require the spaces to come equipped with a set of canonical computable sequences which are such that sequences can be _ stretched _ by wait - and - see strategies and the operator taking convergent sequences to their limits is effective .",
    "in addition all basic open sets need be completely enumerable , uniformly in their index .",
    "all these conditions seem very natural , but as we will see , in particular the combination of wait - and - see strategies with the computation of limits has a strong impact on the topology .",
    "if we deal with spaces as the total computable functions or the computable real numbers , then a metric is at hand which allows putting stronger conditions on the convergence of sequences , e.g. , we can prescribe its velocity .",
    "these conditions are important in order to be able to render the limit operator computable , however they are not compatible with wait - and - see strategies . other algorithmic techniques like decision procedures are at hand instead . also for spaces of this kind",
    "it is shown that effective operators are effectively sequentially continuous .",
    "however , we have not been able to present a uniform approach to the question whether effective operators are effectively sequentially continuous as we did in the case of effective continuity .",
    "it is even not clear whether this holds in general .",
    "a modification of friedberg s example shows that effective operators are not sequentially continuous in general .",
    "but this still leaves open the possibility that they are effectively sequentially continuous as we are dealing with computable sequences only in this case",
    ".    as is well known , limits of point sequences in a @xmath0 space are not uniquely determined . in the joint paper @xcite we had to make a special assumption to handle this problem .",
    "later , in @xcite we based our approach on filter convergence to get rid of it . in both cases we had to assume that one can effectively pass from a computable enumeration of the sequence elements and/or a filter base to the points they converge to .",
    "the relationship between both conditions will be studied as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ basic ] contains basic definitions . in section  [ eff ] notions and results from the theory of effective spaces are recalled .",
    "a new construction of an acceptable numbering is given .",
    "important special cases of such spaces are considered in section  [ speccase ] .",
    "the condition of a numbering having a limit algorithm and the existence of such numberings is discussed in section  [ lim ] . in section  [ cont ] the relationship between effective continuity notions of different strength is investigated , in particular the connection between effective continuity and effective sequential continuity . finally , in section  [ map ] , the question of when an effective map is effectively sequentially continuous is examined .",
