    "therefore , @xmath56 is also the unique idempotent of @xmath377 : indeed , if @xmath465 is idempotent , then @xmath466 , and hence @xmath467 .",
    "thus , @xmath468 is a closed submonoid of @xmath377 with neutral element @xmath56 and no other idempotent . in view of (",
    "2.2.5 ) , it follows that @xmath469 is a group , say , @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath470 , and hence @xmath97 for all @xmath471 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath146 is a closed subgroup of @xmath39 and @xmath472 is a positive integer such that @xmath473 for all @xmath474 , then @xmath146 contains @xmath475 , and hence @xmath457 by minimality . in particular , the neutral element of @xmath146 is @xmath56 .",
