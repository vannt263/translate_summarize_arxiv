    "general relativity ( gr ) is based on einstein s equivalence principle ( eep ) which implies that gravitation is a metric theory .",
    "eep consists of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) , local lorentz invariance ( lli ) and local position invariance ( lpi ) ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "all these notions essentially rely on point particles and paths",
    ". therefore gr is primarily applicable to the motion of satellites , planets and light rays .",
    "however , since quantum matter possesses more degrees of freedom and is always spread out at least over a certain space - like region , a theory of gravity at the quantum level may be different from gr at the classical level and therefore should be founded on principles using quantum mechanics only .",
    "it may be possible , for example , that gravity on the quantum level has to be described by more fields than the metrical field .",
    "in addition , for doing tests of the foundations of gr on the quantum level , one should take into account that there may be more possibilities to break lli and lpi on the quantum level than on the classical level .",
    "therefore , in order to test gravitational theories at the quantum level it is necessary to use a test theory which is based solely on quantum notions .",
    "we do not transcribe classical notions into the quantum domain , e.g. introduce a ppn metric or the corresponding @xmath0matrices into the klein ",
    "gordon or dirac equation .",
    "one should allow the most general interaction on the quantum level .",
    "we base our test theory on a generalised pauli equation ( gpe ) which on the one hand is general enough to allow violations of wep , lli , and lpi , and on the other hand still obeys fundamental quantum principles .",
    "an important point is that we include spin which is necessary since there are no massive particles without spin .",
    "an important point of our considerations is that in order to arrive at our test theory we do not use any geometrical notion .",
    "this is necessary from a logical point of view since we want to reach the result , that only under certain circumstances ( experimental results ) , gravitation can be described by means of a space  time geometry .",
    "in addition , we do not use a lagrangian formalism .",
    "our test theory is a test theory for both special relativity _ and _ gr together .",
    "in contrast to the test theory of robertson @xcite and mansouri  sexl @xcite , and also their gravitationally modified form @xcite , our theory does not rely on a selected frame of reference .",
    "it is the _ dynamics _ of the quantum field which is responsible for whether lli is violated or not .",
    "the coupling to gravity is accomplished by introducing the newtonian potential in a most general way which may be particle dependent .",
    "there are other test theories , like the @xmath1 @xcite formalism , which allows a difference in the velocity of light and the maximum speed of massive particles .",
    "the main difference between this and our test theory , is that in our case the violation of the eep is due to the structure of the dynamical equation of one matter field , and not due to an ` anomalous ' interaction between matter and the electromagnetic field . in this sense",
    "our test theory is not an alternative to the @xmath1formalism , but instead a theory of one single multicomponent matter field .",
    "the structure of the coupling of the gpe ( or of the generalised dirac equation on which we base our gpe ) to the electromagnetic field is another question .",
    "it may indeed happen that both fields , the gpe and the maxwell field , are dynamically incompatible in the sense that they possess to two different maximal velocities of propagation which of course leads to certain observable consequences .",
    "it is the @xmath1 formalism which describes the experimental consequences due to this difference in the maximum speed in , for example , atomic systems . here",
    "we skip this point and assume the usual minimal coupling to the electromagnetic field obeying the usual maxwell equations .",
    "best estimates for parameters characterising the violation of lli and lpi are given by hughes  drever type experiments and by the vessot  levine rocket red shift experiment ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "lpi and lli violating parameters are constraint by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . here",
    "we want to indicate that in some cases more precise tests are possibleusing atom beam interferometers of the kasevich ",
    "chu type @xcite .",
    "if one carries through atom beam interferometric tests in the field of the earth with two different types of atoms , then the accuracy of these devices may test the validity of the wep in the quantum domain with an accuracy @xmath4 ( it is announced that these interferometers may be improved in the near future ) and may especially restrict the lpi violating parameter to an accuracy of about @xmath5 which will be an imoprovement of the present estimate by three orders .",
    "hughes  drever type experimenbts are already carried through , and we use a reanalysis of these experiments for calculating constraints for the parameters of our test theory .",
    "in addition , since all experiments made on earth are in fact done in a noninertial frame moving in a gravitational field , each high precision experiment can be used as a test of the underlying space ",
    "time structure .    in the following",
    "we treat the gpe which we derive from a non",
    " relativistic limit of a generalised dirac equation ( gde ) .",
    "then we calculate some experiments , namely atom beam interferometry @xcite , and the modification of energy levels of atoms , and give estimates for the various parameters describing lli and lpi  violation .",
    "we base our non  relativistic test theory on a generalised dirac equation ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) where @xmath8 is a complex 4component field ( it is possible to carry through the following consideration for higher component fields too ; however , we want to restrict to the physically most important case which is connected to spin@xmath9fields ) . all matrices are complex @xmath10-matrices and @xmath11 and @xmath12 obey @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "however , they are not assumed to fulfill a clifford algebra .",
    "here we introduced the coupling to the maxwell field in the usual manner namely through minimal coupling @xmath16 .",
    "we also take the usual form of the maxwell field as granted ( for the experimental status of the electromagnetic field to obey eep compare @xcite ) .",
    "it is of course also possible to couple the maxwell field in an anomalous way to the gde , analogous to the @xmath1formalism .",
    "however , since any modification of this kind will result in corrections of the same structure as those which we will derive below , we will not take anomalous couplings to the maxwell field into account .",
    "we also introduced a @xmath17 which has the dimension of a velocity .",
    "this velocity can be introduced by considering the null cones which the gde defines : @xmath17 is the maximum speed of propagation ( from the physical point of view it is approximately the velocity of light , because any deviation from srt , if there is any , is small ) .",
    "the purpose of this velocity is twofold : first , it makes the coefficient in front of the spatial derivative dimensionless ( what is necessary in order to connect @xmath11 with space  time geometry ) , and second , it will be used later as ordering parameter in a foldy  wouthuysen transformation leading to the non  relativistic limit of the gde .    the splitting between the matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 is defined by means of a wkb approximation ( compare @xcite ) . while @xmath19 is the `` mass''tensor which appears in the lowest order of approximation , @xmath20 influences the first order only .",
    "both matrices have the dimension of @xmath21 . in order to extract from the `` mass''tensor a dimensionless matrix possessing a geometrical meaning",
    ", we introduced a parameter @xmath22 ( so that @xmath23 has the dimension @xmath24 ) which can also be defined via the wkb approximation .",
    "( [ gde ] ) is general enough to describe violations of basic principles of gr .",
    "however , since ( [ gde ] ) is a symmetric hyperbolic system very general principles of quantum mechanics are still fulfilled , namely ( i ) the well  posedness of the cauchy problem , ( ii ) the superposition principle , ( iii ) finite propagation speed , and ( iv ) a conservation law .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that this gde can be derived from these fundamental principles , see @xcite for a review .    if we introduce the quantities @xmath25 then the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 fulfill @xmath26 where the deviation from the usual clifford algebra is described by the matrices @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "( in the case @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 one can represent @xmath33 and @xmath34 with matrices @xmath35 fulfilling @xmath36 , @xmath37 . even in the case",
    "that the @xmath27matrices do not vanish it can be shown @xcite that the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 fulfill a generalised clifford algebra . )",
    "if the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 do not fulfill the usual clifford algebra then the characteristic surfaces ( null cones ) and the mass shells ( see figure ) of the generalised dirac equation split and do not longer coincide with the usual light cones and mass shells .",
    "it is obvious that in these cases lli is violated .",
    "this has also been discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a velocity @xmath17 can also be introduced by means of the quadratic form based on the tensor @xmath38 defined by ( [ g00][bfgmunu ] ) , which can be chosen to possess the signatur 2 compatible with the required propagation properties of the field @xmath8 .      while the dirac equation is an equation for four spinorial components , a non - relativistic limit , the pauli equation , has two components only .",
    "we have to eliminate two components which are small in the physical situation under consideration . the matrix which serves as tool for distiguishing the upper and lower ( that is , the large and small ) components is , as usual , @xmath39 . we also introduce as usual even and odd operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 which fulfill @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "first we split the matrices @xmath11 and @xmath20 into an even and odd part : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we have @xmath46 and @xmath47",

    "this hamilton operator is of course hermitian since the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 are hermitian .",
    "we now make some specifications of the coefficients appearing in ( [ gpe1 ] ) in order to arrive at a physically interpretable generalised pauli equation .    1 .",
    "to start with , we make an ansatz concerning the introduction of the gravitational field .",
    "first , the gravitational field may consist of all coefficients appearing in ( [ gpe1 ] ) .",
    "however , in the non  relativistic regime the main part of the gravitational field is given by the newtonian potential @xmath60 depending on the mass density @xmath61 of the surrounding matter distribution . in order to allow an anomalous coupling to the gravitational field the origin",
    "of which are mass distributions , we also take gravitational field tensors @xmath62 into account ( see e.g @xcite ) . there",
    "may also exist gravitational fields the origin of which are not mass distributions , but for example spin  sources which is the case in einstein  cartan theories , see @xcite .",
    "since these gravitational fields are expected to be very small we do not specify any spatial dependence of these fields : all gravitational fields which have their origin in other sources than in mass distributions are treated as constant .",
    "therefore we assume that the @xmath63dependence of the coefficients appearing in the above non  relativistic limit is only mediated by the newtonian potential and the corresponding gravitational potential tensor @xcite .",
    "the remaining constant parts may be responsible for violations of lli .",
    "explicitly @xmath64 where all coefficients @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are constant matrices .",
    "while @xmath65 and @xmath67 may be responsible for a violation of lli , that is , for a violation of special relativity in vacuum , the other matrices may lead to @xmath72induced violations of lli and lpi .",
    "+ in other words : after the specification of the dependence of the matrices @xmath12 , @xmath11 , and @xmath20 from the potential @xmath72 and @xmath73 the remaining matrices @xmath65 , @xmath74 , and @xmath69 may also depend on @xmath63 in a way not mediated by @xmath72 .",
    "however , since we are going to describe experiments which are performed on a small scale only ( atom beam interferometry , huges  drever experiments ) any @xmath63depencence which is not due to the newtonian potential can be neglected and be replaced by the actual value of these matrices at the position of the experiment .",
    "therefore , the above dependence on @xmath63 is the only position  dependence of the corresponding matrices , that is @xmath75 , and similarly for the matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "+ although we know from experience that @xmath72 should be the newtonian potential , at this stage of reasoning we do not need this specification so that at this place we take @xmath72 and @xmath73 to be some unknown scalar and tensorial gravitational potentials .",
    "it is only at the last step where one makes a comparison with experiments that @xmath72 is identified with the newtonian potential and @xmath73 with the gravitational potential tensor .",
    "+ the dependence on @xmath73 can be described by any parameter ; we have chosen just for convenience and for staying in contact with the usual notation the combination @xmath78 .",
    "+ the only remaining @xmath63-dependent terms are the gravitational potentials @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the electromagnetic potentials @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and the term @xmath81 .",
    "each anomalous term which does not vanish for @xmath82 describes a possible lli - violation .",
    "consequently , all terms which remain after setting @xmath82 , are small",
    ". therefore we can neglect the square @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath72-dependent terms indicate possible lpi - violations .",
    "we make connection to the case of vanishing gravitational potential and non - rotating frame of reference : we take @xmath84 and assume that these relations hold for all particles ( neutrons , electrons , protons , etc ) .",
    "4 .   we can further simplify the form of @xmath12 of ( [ widetildebeta ] ) by choosing a representation in which @xmath65 is even : @xmath85 .",
    "we restrict to the ` large ' component using the projection operator @xmath86 . by doing",
    "so we introduce the following terms @xmath87}_o & = : & k^{ij } + ( \\epsilon^{ij}_{\\phantom{ij}k } + k^{ij}_k ) \\sigma^k \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the anomalous inertial mass tensor in ( [ anomalinert ] ) consists in two parts : a scalar part and a spin part .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath11 ensures that @xmath89 as well as @xmath90 are real tensors .",
    "note that @xmath89 and @xmath91 depends on @xmath92 only , @xmath12 has no influence on the kinetic term .",
    "we can absorb @xmath93 into the anomalous gravitational mass tensor giving @xmath94 .",
    "+ for the usual clifford algebra we have vanishing parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath93 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "if any one of these parameters does not vanish , lli is violated .",
    "the anomalous parameters which are connected with @xmath69 indicate a violation of lpi .",
    "+ if space ",
    "time is endowed with a hypothetical torsion then the usual dirac equation minimally coupled to metric and torsion gives rise to the quantities @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the latter is the space part of the axial torsion vector , and the first is related to the corresponding time component .",
    "we transform away the term @xmath104 by means of @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting constant scalar parts appearing in the last term of ( [ gpe1 ] ) can be removed by an appropriate transformation .",
    "we arrive at @xmath106 \\widehat\\varphi^\\prime \\label{gpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the electrostatic potential and @xmath108 the magnetic field .",
    "this is the gpe we looked for .",
    "all terms but the @xmath72 , @xmath79 , @xmath109 and the @xmath80 which is part of the covariant derivative , are constant .",
    "the tensors @xmath89 and @xmath90 give spin dependent anomalous inertial mass tensors , @xmath102 and @xmath96 amount to a spin  momentum coupling , @xmath110 may be considered as a spin  dependent `` rest mass '' , the @xmath111 may be interpreted as or identified with the space  like part of an axial torsion vector , and @xmath94 and @xmath112 are anomalous spin dependent passive gravitational mass tensors . @xmath113 and",
    "@xmath114 give anomalous modifications of the coupling of the magnetic field to the spin@xmath9 particle .",
    "due to our systematic approach ( [ gpe ] ) contains all possible anomalous interactions on the non  relativistic level .",
    "the gpe ( [ gpe ] ) is a non  trivial generalisation of haugan s @xcite test theory for matter with spin .",
    "a distinguished feature of ( [ gpe ] ) is the anomalous coupling of spin to the newtonian potential .",
    "such couplings have been considered first by hari dass @xcite . however , our coupling of the spin to the newtonian potential is different from the coupling hari dass @xcite introduced for spherically symmetric newtonian gravitational fields .",
    "while his couplings are of relativistic order on dimensional grounds , we obtained such a coupling by means of an additional anomalous property @xmath112 of the quantum field . due to this new structure it is possible to have a coupling of the spin to the newtonian potential at non",
    " relativistic order .",
    "note that there is no need and no possibility to introduce any @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , also in the usual schrdinger theory only the ratio @xmath116 enters the equation of motion ( see @xcite ) . in this sense our mass  like parameters are all to be understood in the sense of being the ratio of mass and @xmath115 .",
    "our mass - like parameter has the dimension of @xmath117 , and our hamilton operator has the dimension @xmath118 .",
    "it is no problem to introduce artificially an @xmath115 so that the equations acquire the usual form and all parameters have the usual dimensions .",
    "note also that @xmath119 is dimensionless . @xmath111 and @xmath102 have the dimension 1/length . in the following",
    "we will neglect the coupling of the magnetic field to anomalous terms .",
    "it should be emphasized that it is not possible to absorb the parameters @xmath120 , @xmath119 , and @xmath111 into the inertial or gravitational spin  dependent anomalous mass tensors .",
    "indeed , if we perform a transformation @xmath121 , insert it into ( [ gpe ] ) , and demand that the resulting coefficient of the first derivative should vanish , then we get a transformation matrix @xmath122 which is linear in @xmath63 .",
    "such an @xmath63dependence is not in accordance with a spherically symmetric newtonian potential , for example .",
    "in addition , assuming a time ",
    "dependent transformation necessarily leads to time ",
    "dependent coefficients , which makes a stationary problem non  stationary thus changing the structure of ( [ gpe ] ) dramatically .",
    "since ( [ gpe ] ) can be inferred from the very general gde ( [ gde ] ) all anomalous terms in ( [ gpe ] ) are derived in systematic manner .",
    "these are the most general anomalous terms on the non  relativistic level which can be derived from a gde which is the most general equation obeying the very general basic principles listed above .",
    "the anomalous terms are necessarily connected with that parts of the matrices @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath69 which are responsible for a possible violation of lli and lpi .",
    "a violation of lli is possible even if the gravitational potentials are turned off .",
    "to sum up : we base our _ quantum test theory _ on a gpe ( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the usual scalar mass , @xmath79 and @xmath80 the scalar and vector electromagnetic potential and @xmath109 the magnetic part of the electromagnetic field .",
    "thereby we assume that the electromagnetic interaction has the usual form , that is , there are no eep  violating effects due to electromagnetism . @xmath89 and @xmath123 are anomalous inertial mass tensors where the latter is connected with the spin of the quantum system , and @xmath124 is the passive gravitational anomalous mass tensor .",
    "we introduced in addition a gravitational potential tensor @xmath73 with @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath96 , @xmath119 , and @xmath112 are dimensionless constants .",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath126 , @xmath102 , @xmath96 , and @xmath119 give rise to lli  violation , while @xmath112 and @xmath124 are responsible for lpi  violation . if all these coefficients vanish , we recover the usual schrdinger equation coupled to the newtonian potential .",
    "all coefficients are real .",
    "it is clear that with the energy @xmath23 and the characteristic dimensionless quantity @xmath127 describing a gravitational interaction , the gpe is the most general 2nd order differential equation including spin and the gravitational potential tensor",
    ". only @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath128 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are @xmath63dependent .",
    "@xmath54 is hermitian .",
    "the corresponding classical hamilton function is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the momentum and @xmath131 is the spin of the particle .",
    "the velocity , force and acceleration for vanishing electromagnetic field is @xmath132 where we neglected the dynamics of thr spin vector .",
    "this is reasonable because the corresponding interaction terms are very small .",
    "it is obvious that this generalises haugan s result @xcite by introducing the spin @xmath133 .",
    "in addition , a very important point which one can see by comparing ( [ accel ] ) with ( [ gpe ] ) is that in the gpe there are more lli and lpi  violating parameters than in the acceleration ( [ accel ] ) of the corresponding classical particle with spin , namely @xmath96 and @xmath119 .",
    "this acceleration is that quantity which is measured by etvs  type experiments , like the torsion balance experiments , or the proposed experiments of the bremen  tower and step .",
    "( therefore ( [ accel ] ) is a frame to describe tests of the equivalence principle for macroscopic matter with polarisation . )",
    "that means : _ if the classical acceleration fulfills lli and lpi then this does not rule out the possibility of lli and lpi  violating terms on the quantum level_. _ on the quantum level there are more possibilities to violate eep than on the classical level _ , even if one includes polarised bulk matter .    however , by considering the dynamics of spin , one gets access to all the eep violating parameters . for the dynamics of the spin expectation value in the classical approximation we get @xmath134 with @xmath135 that means that besides @xmath89 and @xmath136 all the anomalous parameters influence the spin precession . in other words : only if one takes the path ( [ accel ] ) _ and _ the dynamics of the spin ( [ spindynamics ] ) into account one can make statements about the complete set of parameters characterising the violation of eep .",
    "however , the precession of the net polarisation of a macroscopic body is very difficult to observe .",
    "the corresponding quantum tests ( see below ) are much more sensitive .",
    "it is important that _ any deviation from the usual schrdinger equation coupled to the newtonian potential _ will give rise to lli or lpi  violations .",
    "consequently , _ a non - vanishing of one of the above parameters implies that gravity is not describable by a riemannian space - time metric . _",
    "first we note that the coefficients @xmath137 , @xmath111 , and @xmath102 are due to the term @xmath20 which is not connected with the matrices @xmath92 and @xmath12 and therefore have no influence on the violation of lli .",
    "since we performed a non - relativistic limit we are not able to reduce the generalised clifford algebra by means of possible experiments indicating that the coefficients @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath96 , @xmath119 , and @xmath112 are zero .",
    "the only reasoning which can be done is that _ if experiments indicate that one of the coefficients _ @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath96 , @xmath119 , _ and @xmath112 is non  vanishing then at least one of the @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 is non ",
    "vanishing also_. , ( ii ) @xmath138 , and irreducible tensor part of @xmath139 ( the trace results in a redefinition of the scalar mass @xmath22 ) . ] in other words : any deviation from the usual schrdinger equation coupled to the newtonian potential will give rise to a splitting of the null cone or of the mass shell , and in turn , to a lli or lpi  violation .",
    "that means , a non - vanishing of the above parameters necessarily implies that there is no usual clifford algebra .",
    "therefore , there is no riemannian metric which can be defined from the dynamics of the field under consideration and which is responsible for the dynamical behaviour of the quantum field . _",
    "a non - vanishing of one of the above parameters implies that gravity is not described by a riemannian space ",
    "time metric .",
    "we propose two different kinds of interference experiments where we use an interferometer of kaservich and chu type @xcite .",
    "the first is an experiment where only a spin - flip will be performed whereby both parts of the matter wave propagate with the same momentum .",
    "the second is an interference experiment which measures the acceleration .",
    "we take an atomic beam with a definite spin value along a certain axis propagating with momentum @xmath130 .",
    "we split this atomic state into two states and perform with one of these states two spin - flips , one at time @xmath140 and the second one reverses the first flip at time @xmath141 .",

    "we get the phase shift ( @xmath165 is the vector from the center of the gravitating body ( say , the earth ) to the beam splitter ) @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the sum of both anomalous inertial mass tensors which depend on the spin .",
    "if we align @xmath168 and denote the angle between @xmath165 and @xmath169 by @xmath170 then we get to first order in @xmath94 @xmath171 with @xmath172 where @xmath173 due to the spherical symmetry of the gravitating body . @xmath174 and @xmath175 are constant for one sort of atoms .",
    "note that ( [ kasevichchu ] ) is an exact quantum result although there appears no @xmath115 .",
    "the reason is that only experimentally given quantities like @xmath176 and @xmath137 are used .",
    "the non - diagonal parts @xmath175 induce a deviation from orthogonality : by choosing @xmath164 orthogonal to @xmath177 , the phase shift will not vanish in contrast to the case @xmath178 .",
    "instead we have to first order @xmath179 the phase shift will vanish only for an angle @xmath180 . the diagonal parts @xmath174 modify the amount of the phase shift for given @xmath176 and flight time @xmath137 and are best measured if @xmath181 .",
    "the phase shift is to first order @xmath182 in order to measure @xmath174 and @xmath175 we consider two cases : ( i ) @xmath183 with the phase shift ( [ kcalpha ] ) for measuring @xmath174 and ( ii ) @xmath184 with the phase shift ( [ kcb ] ) for measuring @xmath175 where we use @xmath185 as acceleration of the earth s gravitational field at the position of the beam splitter .",
    "a possible way to measure @xmath174 is to consider the variation of the phase shift ( [ kcalpha ] ) by varying the elevation of the whole interferometer with respect to the surface of the earth , that is , by varying @xmath186 from @xmath187 to @xmath188 .",
    "this procedure is especially appropriate for the raman light- pulse atom beam interferometer because it may be possible to detect by means of phase shifts the difference in the elevation of 1 mm .",
    "this corresponds to an accuracy of the measured phase shift of @xmath189 which @xcite claim to be possible to achieve .",
    "the today s accuracy is @xmath4 . using this experimental setup one gets estimates for @xmath174 by detecting deviations of the measured phase shift from @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the difference of the acceleration between @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "thereby the acceleration or the earth s gravitational potential is measured by gravimeters ( or satellites ) which are of other material composition than the interfering atoms .",
    "therefore we actually compare the possible composition dependence of the gravitational acceleration between the atom beam and other gravimeters .    in principle",
    "the energy levels of the atoms are also modified due to a violation of lpi and lli ( see @xcite for calculations within the @xmath1formalism and below ) . however",
    ", this does not matter since the wave vector and frequency of the laser beam which are related to the difference of the energy levels are given quantities in the quasi newtonian coordinate system .",
    "consequently , we can use formula ( [ kasevichchu ] ) with the actually used momentum @xmath176 to determine @xmath174 : @xmath194 where @xmath79 is the measured variation of the phase shift during elevation of the interferometer from @xmath195 to @xmath196 .",
    "if one assumes a null experiment , then the accuracies of the various entities entering the phase shift will give an estimate of the value of @xmath174 which depends on the accuracy of @xmath79 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 .",
    "the first two have been estimated in @xcite to @xmath199 and the best absolute gravimeters have an accuracy of @xmath200 .",
    "consequently , an observation of the phase shift by elevating the whole interferometer about @xmath201 m and a null result will give @xmath202 and consequently @xmath203 . with the results of hughes  drever type experiments ( see below ) these experiments amount to an estimate @xmath204 which is usually tested by red  shift experiments to @xmath205 , see @xcite , for example .",
    "a second way to measure this effect is to take a second apparatus with a different kind of atoms , elevate the two apparatus , and to compare the phase shifts . here",
    "one does not need a measurement of the gravitational acceleration by some gravimeter . in this case one",
    "measures the difference @xmath206 with , for a null result , an accuracy given by the atom beam interferometers @xmath207 .",
    "a third way to measure @xmath174 with ( [ kcalpha ] ) is to stay with the apparatus at the same position and vary @xmath137 which leads approximately to the same estimate for @xmath174 and @xmath208 as above .    for measuring @xmath175 we have to align @xmath164 orthogonal to @xmath209 . for a given initial velocity of the atoms and a specially chosen time @xmath137 one can arrange that the atoms may fly parts of parabolae so that the @xmath210 pulses interact with the beams on the same height and the @xmath211 pulse hits both beams at their peak . if the experiment gives a null result then the accuracy of @xmath175 is limited by the accuracy of fixing @xmath164 exactly orthogonal to @xmath209 . since this accuracy is approximately @xmath200 ( again given by satellite results ) we have @xmath212 and consequently @xmath213 .",
    "we can also use the above hamiltonian to calculate the zeeman  splitting of energy levels in an atom . in order to do that we first have to consider a two - particle system and to eliminate the center  of  mass motion . in the case of a heavy nucleus",
    ", we can neglect the difference between the mass and the reduced mass . with the single particle hamiltonian ( [ gpe ] ) and fixing the nucleus at @xmath214 we get the hamiltonian describing the energy levels of an electromagnetically bound system : @xmath215 with @xmath216 and where @xmath217 is the nuclear binding potential . here",
    "@xmath63 is the relative coordinate between e.g.  the core of a nucleus and a valence proton .",
    "note that there are no einsteinian effects due to the acceleration @xmath218 .",
    "this is in accordance with the equivalence principle : the effect of gravitational acceleration can be cancelled by a transformation to a suitable accelerated frame .",
    "@xmath219 describes the atom without external fields and without disturbances , @xmath220 is the interaction of the electron with an external constant magnetic field , and @xmath221 gives lli and lpi - violating effects .",
    "terms linear in @xmath222 do not contribute in first order to energy shifts .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is the equation for the energy levels .",
    "we can consider the case of an atomic nucleus which consists of a core and a valence proton which is considered in the usual hughes - drever experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath223 we have a @xmath224 core and a valence proton with angular momentum @xmath225 and spin @xmath226 . in @xcite and @xcite @xmath227 and @xmath228 with a similar nuclear structure",
    "was used . with the wave functions @xmath229 for the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath230 the matrix elements of @xmath221 are easily calculated whereby the matrix elements linear in momentum and in the relative position vanish . therefore , the energy levels for the hyperfine - splitting are shifted and the singlet line thus splits into three lines with the energies @xmath231 with @xmath232 where we modelled @xmath217 by the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "@xmath233 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "@xmath234 and @xmath235 is responsible for a splitting of the single line into three lines , and @xmath236 shifts all three lines in the same way .",
    "the search for these splittings during the change of the @xmath237-axis with respect to the nonrotating newtonian coordiante system amounts to a test of lli and lpi  violation . using the experimental accuracy of this type of experiment ( see @xcite , also @xcite ) we have @xmath238 so that , provided no unfortunate cancellation of terms occurs , we get the estimates @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 where we used @xmath243 and the gravitational potential @xmath244 of our galaxy . the estimate on @xmath111 may be interpreted as the till now tightest constraint on a hypothetical axial torsion @xcite .",
    "since only the relative coordinate @xmath63 appears in ( [ hnoneinst ] ) our cause of violation of lli is different from that described by the @xmath1-formalism @xcite : while in the latter case the lli - violation is due to a relative velocity with respect to the rest frame of the universe , it is in our case due to the anomalous mass tensors appearing in the gpe .",
    "these lli - violating terms can not be transformed away by choosing a special frame of reference .",
    "we have presented a general approach to a pauli equation describing all possible anomalous couplings of the matter field to the newtonian gravitational field and to hypothetical other gravitational fields . in deriving this equation",
    "we did not use any theoretical concept which has no direct physical interpretation nor any geometrical notion .",
    "the latter should be a consequence of experiments .",
    "therefore we obtained in a systematic manner all anomalous couplings on the non - relativistic level , thus enlarging in a non  trival way haugan s test theory .",
    "main features of our quantum test theory are that we include spin in a non  trivial way and that it possesses more possibilities to violate lli and lpi than the corresponding classical theory .",
    "we want to remark that the @xmath1formalism leads to anomalous coupling terms which are part of our set of anomalous terms derived above .",
    "consequently , if one of these parameters does not vanish , then it needs further experimental and theoretical analysis in order to distinguish whether this anomalous term is due to an underlying gde considered in this work , or due to an anomalous coupling between the quantum field and the maxwell field .",
