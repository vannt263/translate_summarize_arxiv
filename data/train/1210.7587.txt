    "in a striking contribution  @xcite , nualart and peccati discovered a few years ago that the fourth moment of homogeneous polynomial chaos on wiener space characterizes convergence toward the gaussian distribution .",
    "specifically , and in a simplified ( finite dimensional ) setting , let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , be defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 are real numbers vanishing on diagonals and symmetric in the indices .",
    "assume by homogeneity that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the standard gaussian measure on @xmath6 .",
    "such a function @xmath7 will be called homogeneous of degree @xmath8 .",
    "let now @xmath9 on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , be a sequence of such homogeneous polynomials of fixed degree @xmath8 .",
    "the main theorem of nualart and peccati  @xcite expresses that the sequence of distributions of the @xmath9 s converges toward the standard gaussian distribution @xmath13 on the real line if and only if @xmath14 ( 3 being the fourth moment of the standard normal ) .",
    "the result actually holds for homogeneous chaos on the infinite dimensional wiener space , and the equivalence is further described in terms of convergence of contractions .",
    "the proof of  @xcite relies on multiplication formulas for homogeneous chaos and the use of stochastic calculus .",
    "since  @xcite was published , numerous improvements and developments on this theme have been considered ; cf .",
    ", for example , @xcite@xmath15 an introduction to some of these developments ( with emphasis on multiplication formulas ) is the recent monograph @xcite by peccati and taqqu . in particular , the work by nualart and ortiz - latorre  @xcite introduces a technological breakthrough with a new proof only based on malliavin calculus and the use of integration by parts on wiener space . in this work ,",
    "the convergence of @xmath16 to a gaussian distribution [ and thus also  ( [ equ2 ] ) ] is also shown to be equivalent to the fact that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the variance with respect to @xmath19 . based upon this observation , recent work by nourdin and peccati",
    "@xcite develops the tool of the so - called stein method ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) in order to quantify the convergence toward the gaussian distribution . relying also on multiplication formulas and the use of integration by parts on wiener space , one key step in the investigation  @xcite",
    "is expressed by the following inequality : for a given homogeneous function @xmath7 of degree @xmath8 on @xmath6 normalized in @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 only depends on @xmath8 . in particular , the proximity of @xmath23 to 3 controls the variance of @xmath24 .",
    "now , stein s method for homogeneous chaos on wiener space as developed in  @xcite expresses that @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for some appropriate distance between the law @xmath27 of @xmath7 and @xmath13 , so that @xmath24 being close to a constant forces the distribution of @xmath7 to be close to a gaussian distribution .",
    "the conjunction of  ( [ equ4 ] ) and  ( [ equ5 ] ) thus describes how the fourth moment condition controls convergence to a gaussian .",
    "the primary motivation of this work is to understand what structure of a functional @xmath7 allows for the preceding results , in particular thus the control by the fourth moment of the distance to the gaussian distribution . in the process of this investigation",
    ", we will revisit the preceding results and conclusions in the setting of a symmetric markov operator , including , as a particular example , the ornstein  uhlenbeck operator @xmath28 , corresponding to the wiener space setting . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "observe that the homogeneous polynomial @xmath7 of  ( [ equ1 ] ) is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath8 of the ornstein  uhlenbeck operator , that is , @xmath29 .",
    "we shall therefore try to understand what is necessary for an eigenfunction @xmath7 of a markov operator in order to satisfy an inequality such as  ( [ equ4 ] ) .",
    "this investigation leads us to define a notion of chaos eigenfunction with respect to such a markov operator with pure point spectrum consisting of a countable sequence of eigenvalues , the homogeneous polynomial @xmath7 of  ( [ equ1 ] ) being one example with respect to the ornstein  uhlenbeck operator",
    ". the main achievement of this work is then the formulation of an explicit condition on the sequence of eigenvalues under which a chaos eigenfunction satisfies an inequality such as  ( [ equ4 ] ) .",
    "the basic data will thus be a markov operator @xmath30 on some state space @xmath31 with invariant and reversible probability measure @xmath32 and symmetric bilinear carr du champ operator @xmath33,\\ ] ] acting on functions @xmath34 in a suitable domain @xmath35 . for simplicity , we often write @xmath36 which is always nonnegative . by invariance and symmetry of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath30 , the definition of the carr du champ operator @xmath37 yields the integration by parts formula @xmath38 in particular @xmath39 since @xmath40 by the markov property . the operator @xmath30 is said , in addition , to be a diffusion operator if , for every smooth function @xmath41 , and every @xmath42 , @xmath43 alternatively , @xmath37 is a derivation in the sense that @xmath44 .",
    "we refer to the lecture notes  @xcite , chapter 2 , by bakry for an introduction to this abstract framework of markov and carr du champ operators and a discussion of some of the examples emphasized below .",
    "additional general references include  @xcite for further probabilistic interpretations and @xcite for constructions in terms of dirichlet forms ; see also  @xcite and the forthcoming  @xcite . one prototype example of a markov diffusion operator is the ornstein  uhlenbeck operator acting on say the algebra @xmath45 of polynomial functions @xmath46 on @xmath47 as @xmath48 , with invariant and reversible probability measure the gaussian distribution @xmath49 and carr du champ @xmath50",
    ". one could consider its infinite dimensional extension on wiener space ( cf .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , chapter  1 ) , but for simplicity in the exposition we stick here on the finite dimensional case as a reference example .",
    "the preceding general setting also includes discrete examples , such as the two - point space and its products .",
    "namely , on @xmath51 , let @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath30 is invariant and symmetric with respect to the uniform measure @xmath32 on @xmath56 with carr du champ @xmath57 , but is not a diffusion operator .",
    "these two examples actually entail a crucial chaos structure in the sense that the generators @xmath30 may be diagonalized in a sequence of orthogonal polynomials ( hermite polynomials in the gaussian case , walsh polynomials in the cube example ) ; see , for example , @xcite , chapter 1 ,  @xcite , chapter 1 ,  @xcite , chapter 2 ,  @xcite , chapter 5 .",
    "more precisely , setting for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the sequence of orthonormal hermite polynomials on the real line , any function @xmath62 in @xmath63 may be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the scalar product in @xmath20 and where the second sum runs over all @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "an element @xmath68 with @xmath69 is an eigenfunction of the ornstein  uhlenbeck operator with @xmath70 and the spectrum of the operator @xmath71 thus consists of the sequence of the nonnegative integers . for fixed @xmath72 ,",
    "linear combinations @xmath73 define generic eigenfunctions ( chaos ) of @xmath71 with eigenvalue @xmath8 , the homogeneous function @xmath7 of  ( [ equ1 ] ) being one example .    similarly , if @xmath74 , @xmath75 where the second sum runs over all subsets @xmath76 of @xmath77 with @xmath8 elements and @xmath78 are the so - called walsh polynomials . for the discrete operator @xmath79 , @xmath80 if @xmath81 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath71 is thus equal to @xmath82 , and linear combinations @xmath83 describe the family of eigenfunctions ( chaos ) of @xmath71 with eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "a further example is poisson space . in dimension one ,",
    "let @xmath32 be the poisson law on @xmath82 with parameter @xmath84 .",
    "for a function @xmath85 with finite support say , let @xmath86 for every @xmath87 [ @xmath88 .",
    "the poisson operator may then be defined as @xmath89 , .",
    "it is not a diffusion .",
    "the associated carr du champ operator is given by , @xmath87 .",
    "the operator @xmath90 has a spectrum given by the sequence of the integers and is diagonalized along the charlier orthogonal polynomials .",
    "multi - dimensional poisson models are similar .",
    "laplacians @xmath91 on ( compact ) riemannian manifolds , and acting on families of smooth functions , also enter this framework .",
    "these laplacians are diffusion operators and , in the compact case , have again a spectrum consisting of a countable sequence of eigenvalues ; cf .",
    ", for example , @xcite .",
    "this work will analyze properties of eigenfunctions of such markov operators @xmath30 , that is , functions @xmath92 ( in the domain of @xmath30 ) such that @xmath93 for some @xmath94 .",
    "( we emphasize that @xmath7 and @xmath95 are thus rather eigenfunction and eigenvalue of @xmath71 which is nonnegative . )",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to find conditions on such an eigenfunction @xmath7 of a diffusion operator @xmath30 in order that the analog of  ( [ equ4 ] ) holds , and that the fourth moment condition then ensures the proximity with the gaussian distribution .",
    "we outline here the various steps of the investigation .",
    "the first step will be to show ( following  @xcite in the ornstein  uhlenbeck setting ) that stein s method applied to an eigenfunction @xmath7 indicates that it has a gaussian distribution if ( and only if ) its carr du champ @xmath96 is constant ; see proposition  [ proposition1 ] below . more precisely , in accordance with  ( [ equ5 ] ) , for suitable families of functions @xmath97 , and whenever @xmath98 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the variance with respect to @xmath32 .    on the basis of this result , the fourth moment condition appears quite naturally by the integration by parts formula since ( assuming the necessary domain and integrability conditions ) @xmath101 moreover , @xmath102 , so that , still assuming by homogeneity that @xmath98 , @xmath103 this identity is the first indication that the proximity of @xmath104 with 3 actually amounts to the proximity of @xmath96 with its constant mean value @xmath95 .    the next step in the investigation , the main result of this note , describes a chaos structure of an eigenfunction @xmath7 of a markov operator @xmath30 ( not necessarily diffusive ) with spectrum consisting in a sequence @xmath105 of eigenvalues in order that whenever @xmath7 is such a chaos with eigenvalue @xmath106 normalized in @xmath107 , @xmath108 for some finite constant @xmath109 only depending on @xmath110 .",
    "the relations  ( [ equ8 ] ) ,  ( [ equ9 ] ) and  ( [ equ10 ] ) together therefore describe how the fourth moment condition@xmath111 ensures that @xmath112 is close to constant and thus that the distribution of @xmath7 is close to gaussian .",
    "this family of inequalities may then be used to describe convergence to a gaussian distribution of a sequence of such chaos eigenfunctions .",
    "the abstract chaos structure underlying these results is defined by means of the iterated gradients of the markov operator @xmath30 and is shown to easily cover the examples of wiener , walsh or poisson chaos .",
    "for example , the chaos structure of the homogeneous polynomial @xmath7 of  ( [ equ6 ] ) actually amounts to the fact that @xmath113 .",
    "the proof of  ( [ equ10 ] ) will proceed by a standard and direct algebraic @xmath37-calculus on eigenfunctions involving the iterated gradients of the operator @xmath30 and avoiding any type of multiplication formulas for chaos .    turning to the content of this note , section  [ sec2 ]",
    "briefly presents stein s method applied to an eigenfunction of a markov diffusion operator .",
    "the next section discusses the iterated gradients and the associated @xmath37-calculus on eigenfunctions , of fundamental use in the investigation .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] introduces the notion of chaos of a markov operator with pure point spectrum and presents the aforementioned main result  ( [ equ10 ] ) , proved in section  [ sec6 ] . the last section briefly describes analogous conclusions for convergence to gamma distributions covering recent results of  @xcite .",
    "it should be carefully emphasized that the present exposition develops more the algebraic and spectral descriptions of the problem under investigation [ and concentrates on a proof of  ( [ equ10 ] ) ] rather than the analytic issues on domains and classes of functions involved in the analysis .",
    "in particular , we work with families of functions in the domain of the markov operator and its carr du champ and with eigenfunctions assumed to satisfy all the necessary domain and integrability conditions required to develop integration by parts and the associated @xmath37-calculus .",
    "these properties are classically and easily satisfied for the main examples in mind , the gaussian case , the discrete cube or the setting of the laplace operator on a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "note , however , that the extension from the finite dimensional gaussian setting to the infinite dimensional one requires basic analysis on wiener space as presented , for example , in the first chapter of  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) in order to fully justify the domain issues and the various conclusions .",
    "these aspects , carefully developed in the aforementioned references , are not discussed here .",
    "further conditions ensuring the validity of the results presented here might be developed in broader contexts .",
    "we start our investigation with a brief exposition of stein s lemma applied to eigenfunctions of a diffusion operator .",
    "we refer to  @xcite and the references therein for general introductions on stein s method .",
    "the results below are mere adaptations of the investigation  @xcite by nourdin and peccati in wiener space to which we refer for further details . throughout this section ,",

    "let then @xmath123 be an eigenfunction of @xmath71 with eigenvalue .",
    "the observation here , at the root of stein s argument , is that whenever @xmath124 is ( @xmath32-almost everywhere ) constant , then @xmath30 commutes to @xmath7 through the ornstein  uhlenbeck operator @xmath116 , and thus the distribution @xmath119 of @xmath7 is gaussian .",

    "for an eigenfunction @xmath7 , @xmath131 constant thus forces the distribution of @xmath7 to be gaussian .",
