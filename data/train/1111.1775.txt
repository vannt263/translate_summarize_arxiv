    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) has become a paradigm in non - equilibrium statistical physics , due to its rich phenomenology and wide applicability  @xcite .",
    "the majority of this work has focused on the case of a single tasep with a fixed entry rate ( corresponding to infinite availability of particles ) .",
    "however , many physical and biological situations involve multiple lattices with different parameters , whose dynamics is coupled via competition for a finite pool of particles . in this paper",
    ", we present a simple mean - field theoretical framework to study such scenarios , which can be used for an arbitrary number of lattices and for any distribution of lattice parameters . we show that non - trivial behavior , including extension of the shock phase to a finite region of parameter space , and `` buffering '' of individual currents to changes in the reservoir particle number , can emerge from the competition between lattices for particles .",
    "we further show that in these systems , information on the whole system can be extracted from measurements of the behaviour of an individual lattice subtype .",
    "the standard tasep is a stochastic process which describes the collective movement of particles along a one - dimensional lattice composed of @xmath1 sites . on the lattice ,",
    "a particle hops stochastically from site @xmath2 to @xmath3 , provided that site @xmath3 is empty .",
    "particles enter the first site ( if unoccupied ) and leave the last site with fixed rates .",
    "this model shows three distinct phases controlled by the boundary rates : the low density ( ld ) phase occurs when the entry rate is limiting , the high density ( hd ) phase when then exit rate is limiting , and the maximal current ( mc ) phase when both entry and exit rates are large enough that the current is limited only by the hopping rate along the lattice .",
    "exact steady - state solutions for the density of particles on the lattice and the current are known  @xcite .",
    "first introduced as a model of protein synthesis  @xcite , the tasep nowadays provides a generic model for transport processes , with applications including the production of mrna  @xcite and protein  @xcite in biological cells , the motion of motor proteins along cytoskeletal filaments  @xcite , the transport of vesicles in fungal hyphae  @xcite , collective insect motion  @xcite and traffic flow problems  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have focused on particle motion on a single tasep track ( including tracks with multiple lanes , e.g.  @xcite ) ; in reality , however , one often has multiple tracks , which may have different lengths , hopping and boundary rates , and which compete for a finite number of particles .",
    "for example , in traffic dynamics vehicles may distribute themselves across different roads , while in biological cells different mrna molecules compete for the cellular protein production machinery  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide a simple , intuitive and generic framework to study such problems .",
    "this work is not the first to consider the effects of a finite reservoir of particles , or of competition for particles between several taseps .",
    "recently , adams _",
    "et al _  @xcite and cook and zia  @xcite studied a single tasep with a finite reservoir of particles , using monte carlo simulations , mean - field theory and both simple and generalised domain - wall theories .",
    "@xcite extended this work , using monte carlo simulations and domain - wall theory to describe several taseps of the same or different lengths , sharing the same particle reservoir .",
    "this work revealed interesting effects due to the reservoir - induced coupling between taseps .",
    "in particular , a regime can exist in which reservoir density is independent of the total particle number .",
    "the domain - wall approach is powerful because it can incorporate fluctuations and thus describe accurately the density profiles on the lattices .",
    "however , this approach is difficult to generalize to many lattices with arbitrary distributions of entry and exit rates . here , we take a much simpler , mean - field approach .",
    "our approach does not provide information on fluctuations and can not predict density profiles .",
    "however , it yields a simple way to calculate phase diagrams , and is easy to generalize to arbitrary populations of lattices .    in section [ sec : theory ]",
    ", we describe our mean - field approach and present relations for the partitioning of particles between the reservoir and lattices .",
    "we apply this methodology to the case of a single tasep coupled to a finite reservoir in section [ sec : single ] and to a population of identical lattices in section [ sec::homo ] . as a result of the competition for particles ,",
    "a new region of the phase diagram emerges , in which the ld and hd phases coexist ; the size of this region increases as the particle availability decreases .",
    "next , in section [ sec::mixed ] , we consider a system with two different types of lattices and we find that an ld - hd phase transition on one lattice type causes the behaviour of the other lattice type to become independent of the particle number . in section [ sec::arbitrary ] , we generalize to the case of mixed populations of lattices with arbitrary distributions of boundary rates . here",
    "we find that an ld - hd phase transition on any lattice type `` buffers '' all other lattices to changes in the particle number , and we show that the entire distribution of lattice parameters can be extracted from the current on a single lattice subtype .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section [ sec::conclusion ] .",
    ".summary of the mean - field solutions for a single tasep with fixed entry and exit rate .",

    "the entry rate of particles onto any given lattice depends on the density @xmath35 of particles in the reservoir .",

    "this relation implies that the rate of particle binding events per lattice is proportional to the free particle concentration : this is expected to be true as long as the reservoir does not become too crowded with particles .    in the limit of a large total number @xmath27 of particles ( @xmath39 at constant @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 , so that @xmath35 will tend to the total particle concentration @xmath40 , and we recover the standard tasep with constant entry and exit rates .",

    "a key feature of the systems discussed in this paper is that the behavior of all the lattices is coupled via the shared particle reservoir , so that the function @xmath64 depends on the entire distribution of lattice parameters @xmath154 .",

    "how useful the prescription outlined here would actually be for extracting @xmath166 from real ( noisy ) data , this discussion highlights the important point that , in principle , one can extract information on the parameter distribution of the whole system from measurements of the behavior of just a single system component .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a mean - field theoretical framework to study systems in which multiple taseps with different parameters compete for a common pool of particles .",
    "we expect this approach to be useful in modelling a wide range of systems , from control of gene expression in biological cells to traffic flow problems .",
    "previous work has addressed the effects of a finite particle reservoir on tasep dynamics , for single lattices  @xcite and for multiple lattices with equal boundary rates  @xcite ) ; here , we extend this work to mixed populations of lattices with an arbitrarily complex distribution of parameters .    our theoretical approach , presented in section  [ sec : theory ] , is based on combining the equation for conservation of the total number of particles with the mean - field results for the standard tasep .",
    "this approach provides a simple way to deal with mixed populations of lattices .",
    "although our mean - field theory does not provide information on fluctuations or on density profiles , it nevertheless reveals interesting phenomena which emerge from the competition for particles in a mixed multi - tasep system and provides a method to calculate the full phase diagram .",
    "these phenomena arise because the finite reservoir effectively couples all the lattices , so that a phase transition on one lattice influences the behavior of the others .",
    "although in this work we used the mean - field tasep results , one could easily incorporate into the same framework exact or simulated relations for the particle density as a function of the entry and exit rates .",
    "a key observation which emerges from our work is that for a mixed population of lattices coupled to a finite reservoir of particles , any lattice subtype which enters the sp absorbs all further particles added to the system , buffering the particle reservoir and making the currents and densities of all other lattices insensitive to changes in the total particle number @xmath27 , even though these lattices may be far from their phase boundaries .",
    "this effect is specific to systems where the lattices have _ different _ intrinsic entry and exit rates : if @xmath54 and @xmath6 are the same for all lattices ( and if lattices are large enough to neglect finite size effects ) , phase transitions occur on all lattices at the same critical particle reservoir number and the current does not show an additional plateau as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "this was the case in previous work  @xcite , which considered a mixture of lattice with different lengths but identical boundary rates . in these conditions ,",
    "a plateau in the current as a function of @xmath27 is due only to finite size effects .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying the buffering of the system to changes in @xmath27 is attributable to lattices undergoing the ld - hd transition that `` soak up''changes in the reservoir particle number @xmath25 .",
    "as they undergo this transition , lattices enter the shock phase , in which a queue of particles forms at the end of the lattice . for shock phase lattices ,",
    "the particle entry rate @xmath55 is fixed by the exit rate @xmath6 ( @xmath23 ) : thus the number of particles on a shock phase lattice adjusts to compensate for changes in @xmath25 . in the phase diagram for the standard tasep model ,",
    "the shock phase occurs only on the line separating the hd and ld phases , where @xmath199 ; in the case of a finite reservoir of particles , however , the shock phase occupies a finite region of the @xmath200 phase diagram .",
    "this is because the same entry rate @xmath5 can be achieved over a range of @xmath27 , @xmath25 being set by the position of the domain wall .",
    "an interesting analogy can be drawn between this phenomenon and first order phase separations in ( equilibrium ) thermodynamics .",
    "the plateau in @xmath64 which arises in our models is a direct consequence of the discontinuity in the particle density as a lattice undergoes the ld - hd phase transition .",
    "similarly , a first order phase transition such as the boiling of water involves a discontinuity in the entropy , which is associated with latent heat : during the transition , the temperature remains constant even though further heat energy is constantly being supplied . in this analogy",
    ", heat plays the role of @xmath27 in our models while temperature plays the role of the reservoir particle number @xmath25 .",
    "we also show in this paper that the coupling between lattices induced by a finite particle reservoir makes it possible ( under some circumstances ) to extract the entire distribution of lattice parameters from measurements of the reservoir density , or indeed the current carried by a single lattice subtype , as a function of the total particle number @xmath27 . it will be interesting to explore the feasibility of this approach for extracting information from real , noisy , experimental data .",
    "the multi - track tasep with finite particle reservoir studied here bears a similarity to previous work on taseps on closed networks  @xcite . in particular",
    ", a system of @xmath31 lattices with a common reservoir can be mapped onto a network topology formed by @xmath31 rings having a unique common site  @xcite .",
    "the common site plays an analogous role to a particle reservoir .",
    "however , in that problem , in contrast to the one studied here , both the exit and entry rates depend on the occupation of the common site .    a key priority for future",
    "work must be to explore ways to include the effects of fluctuations , which are neglected in our mean - field approach .",
    "previous work has shown that interesting fluctuation - driven effects , including localisation of domain boundaries , can occur in taseps with finite particle number  @xcite ; extending this work to complex mixtures of tasep is likely to prove fruitful .",
    "another promising avenue may be to study how the behavior of systems of the type studied here changes with changes in their volume : this should prove relevant when modelling transport or protein production dynamics in growing biological cells .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a simple and intuitive mean - field theoretical framework for studying multi - tasep problems with finite reservoir of particles .",
    "our method has allowed us to show that interesting physical phenomena emerge from the competition for particles among non - identical lattices , including buffering of the system to changes in the total particle number .",
