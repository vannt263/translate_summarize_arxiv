    "one possible application of sacs on the complete graph @xmath0 is semi - synchronous orthogonal frequency hopping .",
    "a communication network consists of several transmitters .",
    "as there are overlaps between the transmission ranges they wish to use distinct frequencies at every given time .",
    "malicious adversaries , each located in the vicinity of one of these transmitters , are trying to interfere with the communication by noising several frequencies at every given time .",
    "once an adversary hits his target transmitter s frequency he can tell that his interruption succeeded . in order to avoid persistent interference",
    "the transmitters wish to change frequencies often .",
    "being unable to perfectly synchronize their clocks , the transmitter must take turns at hopping . in this scenario",
    "it is desirable for each transmitter to perform a simple random walk as this would make each of its frequency changes ( hops ) independent from the past with maximal entropy . independence is desirable since the adversary has some access to the frequency history of its target transmitter .",
    "an ideal hopping scheme in this setting is a sac .",
    "an important result of @xcite is that there exists a sac of @xmath3 walks on @xmath0 .",
    "the authors also show in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) that when @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , there exists an avoidance coupling of @xmath18 walks on @xmath0 .",
    "angel , holroyd , martin , wilson and winkler ask : does the existence of an avoidance coupling of @xmath10 walks on @xmath19 , imply the existence of an avoidance coupling of @xmath10 walks on @xmath20 .",
    "our main result is a positive answer to this question :    [ thm : main1 ] if there exists a simple avoidance coupling of @xmath10 walks on @xmath19 , then there exists a simple avoidance coupling of @xmath10 walks on @xmath20 .    combining this with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) we draw the following improved bound .",
    "[ thm : main3 ] there exists a simple avoidance coupling of @xmath21 walks on @xmath20 .",
    "we find it interesting that a byproduct of the proof of theorem  [ thm : main1 ] is that in the extended coupling on @xmath22 one find another @xmath23-th special walk , which is a simple random walk as well , but does not obey the order in which the walkers move in every round . in section  [ sec : posac ]",
    "we investigate this observation and discuss a possible extensions of avoidance coupling to models where the order by which the walks move changes from one round to the next , subject to some restrictions .      in @xcite",
    "the authors give special attention to markovian simple avoidance couplings .",
    "these have the property that whenever a walker s turn to move arrives , he needs only to look at the current configuration walkers to determine the distribution of its next location .",
    "in particular the simple avoidance coupling of @xmath24 walkers on @xmath0 constructed in @xcite has this property , as does the coupling of @xmath18 walkers on @xmath25 .",
    "while our extension theorem does not preserve this property , we preserve the following weaker version . consider a sac in which each site of the underlying graph @xmath20 is assigned a label . at the end of every round a random permutation",
    "is applied to these labels .",
    "such a sac is called _ label markovian _",
    "if whenever a walker s turn to move arrives he needs only to look at the current configuration of the walkers and , in addition , at the current labels of the vertices .",
    "observe that every markovian sac is also a label markovian sac .",
    "it is straightforward to check that our construction preserves label markov property .",
    "probabilistic coupling of several stochastic processes sharing the same distribution , has been introduced to probability theory mainly as a tool to study and prove various properties of that common distribution .",
    "such methods have been successfully used in showing properties such as monotonicity , stochastic dominance and convergence .",
    "nevertheless , probabilistic coupling can also be a subject of study . in this context ,",
    "the natural question is `` in what sense a collection of coupled identically distributed stochastic processes , is different from a collection of independent processes with the same distribution ? '' .",
    "a classical example is that of two random walks on some finite graph @xmath11 .",
    "if two independent random walks move on @xmath11 , then they are bound to collide with high probability after a polynomial number of steps .",
    "collisions occur even if a scheduler is allowed to control the times in which each walk makes his move ( see @xcite,@xcite ) , and can be avoided only if the scheduler has some knowledge of the future of each walk , and only on special graphs ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , there exist many graphs on which coupled random walks can easily avoid each other . on the cycle graph @xmath26 for example ,",
    "two walks which start on non - adjecent vertices can avoid each other by moving in the same direction at every step - either clockwise or counter - clockwise .",
    "coupling of walks on @xmath0 , the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices , appears to be more difficult . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use various techniques inspired by discrete harmonic analysis to create an avoidance coupling of @xmath3 walks on @xmath0 and of @xmath27 walks for an infinity collection of special @xmath1-s .",
    "they also investigate avoidance coupling on @xmath28 , the complete graph with loops on @xmath1 vertices , and obtain a lower bound of @xmath29 walks on this graph .",
    "the authors further show that no coupling exists for @xmath30 walks on @xmath28 , if @xmath31 .",
    "the research of avoidance couplings is closely related to that of brownian motions which keep at least constant distance from each other .",
