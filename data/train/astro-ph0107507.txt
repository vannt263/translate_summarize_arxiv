    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models with scale - invariant initial fluctuation spectra seem to provide a remarkably successful framework for explaining a broad range of observations pertaining to structure on scales larger than @xmath1 mpc .",
    "only recently have n - body techniques achieved the dynamic range necessary to resolve sub - structures within other bound , virialized structures .",
    "this new generation of very high resolution simulations has demonstrated that the presence of numerous sub - structures is an unavoidable consequence within the cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) dominated `` '' models that are now very widely used .",
    "such simulations predict that dark matter halos with the mass of the halos of the milky way or m31 contain within their virial radius several hundred objects with internal velocities similar to those of observed local group dwarf galaxies ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ( kkvp ) ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ( m99 ) ) , whereas only about 40 such galaxies are known in the local group .",
    "this result has come to be known as the `` sub - structure problem '' , and is a direct consequence of the relatively large amount of power on small scales in `` standard ''  models .",
    "a variety of solutions have been proposed which solve the problem by modifying some basic tenant of the usual cdm canon .",
    "these include reducing the small - scale power by appealing to inflationary models with broken scale invariance ( kamionkowski & liddle 2000 ) , or changing the nature of the dark matter , e.g. warm dark matter ( hogan & dalcanton 2000 ; bode et al .",
    "2001 ) , self - interacting dark matter ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) , or strongly annihilating dark matter ( kaplinghat , knox & turner 2000 ) .",
    "it appears , however , that each of these solutions may violate other constraints ( barkana , haiman , & ostriker 2001 ; gnedin & ostriker 2001 ; hui 2001 ; miralda - escud 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we investigate a less exotic solution .",
    "it has long been appreciated that the accretion and cooling of gas by low mass halos will be `` squelched '' in the presence of a strong photoionizing background .",
    "this process has been studied by many authors using analytic approaches ( ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ; babul & rees 1992 ; efstathiou 1992 ; shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ) , 1-d hydrodynamic simulations ( haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ) and full 3-d hydro simulations ( quinn , katz , & efstathiou 1996 ; weinberg , hernquist , & katz 1997 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "these studies concur in the conclusion that after reionization , gas accretion is suppressed in halos with virial temperature less than some characteristic value .",
    "the jeans mass is an obvious candidate for this critical mass scale ( e.g. rees 1986 ) .",
    "however , because dark matter halos in cdm models have complex and varied formation histories , it is clear that some sort of time - averaged jeans mass is needed to determine the gas content of any given halo at any given time . the recent analysis of gnedin ( 2000 ; g00 ) , based on hydrodynamic simulations , suggests that the ` filtering mass ' , which corresponds to the length scale over which baryonic perturbations are smoothed in linear theory , provides a good description of this time - averaged , effective jeans mass .",
    "the net result is that halos with virial velocities @xmath3 3050 km / s are able to collect a substantial amount of gas only if they collapse before the universe is reionized .",
    "bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg ( 2000 ; bkw00 ) investigated whether this effect could resolve the sub - structure problem , using a model based on estimates of halo collapse redshifts obtained from an extension of the press - schechter ( 1974 ) approximation , combined with constraints from n - body results .",
    "they concluded that a combination of tidal destruction and photoionization squelching could very naturally solve the sub - structure problem in the local group .",
    "however , their model did not treat gas physics or star formation explicitly , instead relying on a few phenomenological parameters to determine which halos would host observable galaxies .",
    "chiu , gnedin & ostriker ( 2001 ) also concluded that photoionization squelching would reduce the slope of the galactic mass - function on the scale of dwarf galaxy halos , using scaling arguments based on the press - schechter approximation and results from the simulations of g00 .",
    "it remains worthwhile , however , to investigate this process within the more detailed framework of semi - analytic galaxy formation modeling ( e.g. kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the recipe provided by gnedin ( 2000 ) , based on hydrodynamic simulations , to incorporate the effects of photoionization squelching into a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "we examine the effect on the luminosity function of dwarf galaxies in milky way - sized halos and re - assess whether this process can solve the sub - structure problem .",
    "our models are based on monte carlo merger trees and include treatments of sub - halo merging , gas cooling , star formation , supernovae feedback , chemical enrichment , and stellar population synthesis . in all the models presented here ,",
    "we adopt a `` standard ''  cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 km / s / mpc , and @xmath7 .",
    "our models are based on monte carlo realizations of merger trees constructed using the extended press - schechter formalism and the method of somerville & kolatt ( 1999 ) .",
    "we track the decay of the orbits of sub - halos due to dynamical friction after being subsumed within a larger halo , and when a sub - halo reaches the center of the host halo , it is assumed to merge with the central object ( for details see somerville & primack 1999 ; hereafter sp ) .",
    "we neglect tidal destruction of sub - halos , and also satellite - satellite merging .",
    "we would first like to check that this approximate treatment of the survival of substructure is in agreement with n - body simulations .",
    "[ fig : submf ] shows the cumulative velocity function predicted by the semi - analytic models for sub - halos that reside within the virial radius of a host halo with a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "this is compared with the velocity function of sub - halos within 200 @xmath9 , for halos of similar mass from the n - body simulations of m99 and from recent simulations produced using a new version of the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) code ( kravtsov , klypin , & khoklov 1997 ) with variable mass particles .",
    "these simulations , which we will refer to here as ` the art simulations ' , are similar to those presented in kkvp99 , but have higher mass resolution .",
    "the results are binned in terms of @xmath10 , the circular velocity at the peak of the rotation curve , which is the quantity that is most robust for sub - halos identified in the simulations .",
    "we use the results of bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to calculate @xmath10 for the halos in the semi - analytic merger trees as a function of their mass and collapse redshift .",
    "the semi - analytic trees have been run with the same mass resolution as the n - body simulations ( the smallest halos have a mass of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we see that the semi - analytic merger trees produce more of the small sub - halos ( @xmath12 km / s ) than the art simulations , as found by bkw00 .",
    "the simulations of m99 have a factor of @xmath1323 more of the smallest halos than the art simulations , but this is likely to be mainly due to the @xmath14 scdm cosmology used for the m99 simulations .",
    "the recent  simulations presented by font & navarro ( 2001 ) and governato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) both appear to have about 40 % less substructure than the scdm simulations of m99 , in good agreement with the art results .",
    "some of the discrepancy could also be due to differences in the algorithm used to identify sub - halos , or to the slightly different masses of the host halos .",
    "bkw00 adopted a model for tidal destruction of sub - halos in order to bring the number of surviving sub - halos in the semi - analytic merger trees into agreement with that found in the art simulations .",
    "while it is clear that tidal destruction of sub - halos does occur in the simulations ( a. kravtsov , private communication ) , and tidal destruction of dwarf galaxies does occur in the local group ( we are witnessing it in progress in the case of the sagittarius dwarf ) it is still possible that dissipationless simulations overestimate the effects of tidal destruction relative to the real universe , where the presence of baryons might make galaxies more robust to disruption .",
    "we opt to neglect the effects of tidal disruption in this work , for this reason and also because we wish to find out if the effects of photoionization squelching alone can solve the sub - structure problem .",
    "the basic ingredients of the models used here , which include gas cooling , star formation , supernovae feedback , chemical evolution and stellar population synthesis , are described in detail in sp and somerville , primack & faber ( 2001 ) .",
    "we introduce one new ingredient , the squelching of gas infall by a photoionizing background .",
    "we assume that the universe becomes reionized instantaneously at a redshift @xmath15 , which we treat as a free parameter .",
    "if a halo collapses before @xmath15 , it is allowed to capture a mass @xmath16 of gas which subsequently becomes available for cooling and star formation , where @xmath17 is the universal baryon fraction and @xmath18 is the virial mass of the halo .",
    "after reionization , the gas captured by a halo is given by the fitting function provided by eqn .",
    "7 of g00 : @xmath19 ^ 3}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a characteristic mass , which represents the mass of objects that on average retain 50% of their gas .",
    "we approximate @xmath20 as the mass corresponding to a halo with virial velocity @xmath21 km / s collapsing at redshift @xmath22 ( see the appendix of sp ) .",
    "this provides a good description of the redshift dependence of @xmath20 found in the simulations of g00 : @xmath20 increases from about @xmath23 at @xmath24 to several @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "then , in agreement with the results shown in fig .  2 of g00 and with previous results ( e.g. thoul & weinberg 1996 ; quinn et al .",
    "1996 ) , we find that halos with virial velocity @xmath27 km / s are able to capture about half of the gas that they would accrete in the absence of a background , while halos with @xmath28 km / s are able to accrete very little gas , and halos with @xmath29 km / s are nearly unaffected .",
    "we normalize our models to reproduce the v - band luminosity of the central milky way or m31-like galaxies in our `` local group '' , which we represent as two equal mass halos each with @xmath30 .",
    "the luminosity function of dwarf satellite galaxies for an ensemble of such halos is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwlf ] .",
    "the data points show the v - band luminosity function of dwarf galaxies in the local group from the compilation of irwin ( see also mateo 1998 ) .",
    "we show the model results without supernovae ( sn ) feedback or squelching , and for the models including supernovae feedback according to the usual treatment ( e.g. kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) but without photoionization squelching . for the models without sn feedback ,",
    "the fall - off at @xmath31 is due to the fact that gas within these halos can not cool efficiently via atomic processes , and we have not included cooling by molecules , which we expect to be inefficient ( machacek , bryan & abel 2001 ; haiman , abel & rees 2000 ) . including sn feedback pushes this `` bend '' to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the models including supernovae feedback only , at a level similar to previously published semi - analytic models , fit the luminosity function of satellite galaxies down to about @xmath32 ( a bit fainter than the smc ) , but overproduce fainter objects by a considerable factor  more than one order of magnitude for the faintest objects ( such as draco and carina ) .",
    "we now consider the effect of photoionization squelching as discussed above .",
    "results are shown for three different values of the reionization epoch @xmath15 , and are seen to be relatively insensitive to this parameter within a reasonable range of values ( note that observations constrain the epoch of reionization to @xmath33 , and most cdm - based modelling suggests that it lies in the range @xmath34 ; see the recent reviews by shapiro ( 2001 ) and barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the large galaxies ( the `` milky way '' and `` m31 '' ) are virtually unaffected , the lmc - sized galaxies are slightly affected , and galaxies smaller than the smc are significantly affected by the presence of the background .",
    "the models now produce a reasonably good fit to the observed dwarf satellite luminosity function , especially given that tidal destruction may further reduce the number of satellites and that the observed lf may be incomplete for the faintest objects .",
    "we have compared the multiplicity function of sub - halos within a `` milky way '' sized halo predicted by semi - analytic monte carlo merger trees with that found in high - resolution n - body simulations . in agreement with bkw00",
    ", we found that semi - analytic merger trees predict more substructure than is found in the art simulations .",
    "this is probably due to the tidal destruction of sub - halos in the n - body simulations , which we have chosen to neglect in the semi - analytic models . in continuing to assess the sub - structure issue",
    ", it will be important to determine the importance of tidal destruction of galaxies when the presence of baryons and the effects of baryonic contraction on the halo are included .",
    "the simulations of m99 have a factor of 23 more sub - halos than the art simulations , which is probably due to the scdm cosmology used by m99 . the physical origin of this cosmology dependence ( now confirmed by several groups )",
    "is not yet clear and should be investigated .",
    "all previously published studies of which we are aware ( e.g. m99 ; kkvp99 ; bkw00 ) have illustrated the sub - structure problem in terms of the circular velocity function of sub - halos and satellite galaxies .",
    "however , in order to do this the observed velocity dispersions of the dwarf satellite galaxies ( which are predominantly spheroidal ) must be converted to rotation velocities by making some assumptions about the geometry and the potential .",
    "it is generally assumed that the orbits are isotropic and the potentials isothermal ( m99 ) ; however , this assumption is uncertain and probably inaccurate at the 50% level , as the velocity dispersions of many spheroids drop in the inner region where the dwarf velocity dispersions are measured ( white 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of baryons modifies the rotation curve , so that the peak velocity of the dark matter halo does not necessarily correspond with the peak velocity of the galaxy that forms within it .",
    "moore ( 2001 ) and font & navarro ( 2001 ) attempt to account for these effects , and it appears unlikely that these corrections are large enough to make the sub - structure problem go away .",
    "still , it is useful to present the comparison in a different form , in terms of the predicted and observed luminosity function of dwarf satellites . while many uncertain ingredients go into modeling galaxy luminosities , at least this quantity is directly observed and the selection effects are relatively well understood .",
    "we find , in agreement with the previous studies based on velocity functions , that models without any kind of feedback dramatically overpredict the number of dwarf satellite galaxies in the local group .",
    "we find that the standard implementation of supernovae feedback generally used in semi - analytic galaxy formation models can not , by itself , solve the substructure problem .",
    "if we increase the efficiency of sn feedback to the point where enough dwarf galaxies are suppressed to solve the sub - structure problem , the feedback produces too great an effect on larger galaxies , introducing a curvature in the tully - fisher relation that is incompatible with observations ( see sp ; also moore 2001 ) .",
    "supernovae feedback might be made to work by introducing a more complicated mass dependence ( rather than a power - law with a single slope ) , but this would have to be formulated in a purely ad - hoc way , and still might have difficulties with other observational constraints .",
    "when we include the suppression of gas accretion by small halos after reionization in our semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , using a recipe based on state - of - the - art hydrodynamic simulations , we find that with no additional tuning , the model then produces very good agreement with the observed luminosity function of satellite galaxies in the local group . the properties of luminous galaxies in the models ( which have been shown previously to agree well with observations ) are nearly unaffected .",
    "the results are not very sensitive to the redshift of reionization , which we treat as a free parameter , although squelching is slightly less effective ( leading to survival of more dwarf galaxies ) when reionization is assumed to be later , because more galaxies are able to form before the squelching is turned on .",
    "it should also be noted that here we have considered only one possible form of photoionization feedback , the suppression of gas collapse due to a uniform background produced by distant stars or quasars .",
    "we have neglected several further effects .",
    "even gas that has managed to collapse might be `` boiled '' out of very small halos ( barkana & loeb 1999 ; haiman , abel & madau 2001 ) .",
    "this effect is expected to be important mainly in the smallest of the halos harboring observable dwarf galaxies ( @xmath35 km / s ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of the background would reduce the efficiency of atomic cooling .",
    "furthermore , the effect of turning on a quasar or starburst in close proximity to the dwarf halos ( as for example , if our galaxy or m31 underwent such episodes , which presumably they did at some point in the past , since both have bulges and probably black holes ) might lead to a more dramatic form of photoionization feedback than the one we have considered here .",
    "some combination of these effects might help to reduce the remaining excess of very faint ( @xmath36 ) satellites in our models .    for @xmath37 , the models with squelching",
    "come very close to producing the correct number of dwarf galaxies even neglecting the above processes and _ with no tidal destruction_. if our treatment of the efficiency of squelching , supernovae feedback , and star formation is reasonably accurate , this suggests that tidal destruction may not be as efficient as dissipationless simulations ( e.g. bkw00 ) would suggest  otherwise , our models would not produce _ enough _ dwarf galaxies !",
    "similarly , models with reduced power on small scales ( such as warm dark matter ) may actually suffer from a reverse sub - structure problem , and fail to produce a sufficient number of dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "the idea that we have explored here is very similar to that investigated by bkw00 .",
    "however , bkw00 did not explicitly model any gas processes ( cooling , star formation , sn feedback , etc ) and so were forced to introduce a more simplified criteria to determine which sub - halos would harbor observable galaxies . while our models use simple recipes to represent the relevant physics , they do contain a self - consistent treatment of the many interwoven processes that determine the present day luminosity of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "we therefore consider it encouraging that our investigation has produced similar conclusions to those of bkw00 .",
    "while there have been suggestions that the photoionization phenomenon could be responsible for producing lyman - limit qso absorption systems at @xmath38 ( abel & mo 1998 ) and bursting dwarf galaxies at @xmath39 ( babul & rees 1992 ) , and the effects of photoionization feedback on the epoch of reionization itself have been explored ( haiman & loeb 1997 ; ciardi et al . 2001 ) , there have been relatively few investigations connecting this physics with the properties of nearby dwarf galaxies , perhaps because most semi - analytic galaxy formation models have not included this effect to date . with this mechanism in place , we are now in a position to investigate many other properties of dwarf galaxies within this framework .",
    "the squelching scenario has a number of interesting implications .",
    "it suggests that there are many barren halos floating around in the local group , as well as many very faint galaxies that lie below current detection limits .",
    "there has been some concern that these halos might heat the disk of our galaxy beyond allowed observational limits , but recent studies ( velzquez & white 1999 ; font & navarro 2001 ) suggest that the halos in question are too small to do much damage . however , the prospects of detecting these halos via gravitational lensing or by direct detection if the earth should happen to pass through one of them ( moore et al .",
    "2001 ) remain intriguing possibilities .",
