    "several lines of evidence suggest that the growth histories of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are closely linked to that of their host galaxies .",
    "these include the well - known scaling relations between the smbh mass ( ) and several properties of the ( bulge component of the ) hosts , observed in local relic systems ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . and the coincidence of intense star formation ( sf ) and smbh growth , at higher redshifts .",
    "indeed , for systems dominated by accretion onto the smbh  identified as active galactic nuclei ( agn )  the luminosities associated with smbh accretion ( ) and with star formation ( ) are correlated over several orders of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the phase of fast smbh growth occurs in tandem with intense sf activity , reaching star formation rates ( sfrs ) of @xmath41000 yr^-1 @xmath5  for smbhs with @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "all this supports a general idea that both processes ( sf and agn ) are fed by a common reservoir of cold gas that collapses , forms stars , and ( eventually ) reaches the central region of the host galaxy to be accreted by the smbh .",
    "a particularly popular framework for the co - evolution of smbhs and their hosts focuses on major mergers between massive , gas - rich galaxies .",
    "theoretical studies highlight the ability of such mergers to account for both the observed properties of agn and sf galaxies , and for the smbh - host relations in relic systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the review by @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , many simulations of such mergers show a relatively short episode ( of order 100 myr ) of parallel intense sf and agn activity , with sfrs reaching several hundred yr^-1 @xmath5  ( or exceeding @xmath12 in some simulations ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observationally , however , the relevance of mergers to fast smbh growth , and indeed to the co - evolutionary framework , is not yet well established . while some studies of low-@xmath13 luminous agn have reported a high occurrence of mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , several other studies have demonstrated that interacting agn hosts are relatively rare at @xmath14 and their occurrence rate does not exceed what was found for non - active galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a possible explanation for these apparently contradictory results , as put forward by @xcite , is that the merger - driven scenario may only be relevant for the epochs of fastest growth of the most massive bh ( that is , highest ) , and at @xmath15  when the overall rate of major mergers is expected to be higher ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the amount of gas in the relevant halos is considerably larger ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "as the relevance of mergers to smbh growth is still debated , several recent studies have highlighted the importance of alternatives to the merger scenario .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are claimed to be most relevant for the early and fast growth of high - redshift smbhs .",
    "such models , however , usually produce sfrs of only a few hundred yr^-1 @xmath5 .",
    "all this suggests that the best way to test and understand the relevance of the merger - driven scenario for smbh growth is to focus on well - defined samples of fast - growing smbhs , preferably at early cosmic epochs ( @xmath16 ) , when the most massive bhs were growing at maximal rates @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the aforementioned scenarios is that such fast - growing smbhs would be predominantly found in significantly over - dense large - scale environments , where the rate of mergers is yet higher and where cold gas streams are expected to converge and provide ample gas supply to the smbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "testing these ideas observationally is , however , extremely challenging .",
    "the agn - related emission dominates over most of the optical - nir spectral regime , significantly limiting the prospects of determining the host properties .",
    "the cosmic environments of the smbhs are often characterized by searching for nearby ( rest - frame ) uv - bright galaxies , without precise redshift determinations , and possibly missing dusty obscured sf galaxies . indeed , several studies provided ambiguous evidence for over - densities around some , but definitely not all @xmath17 quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the so - called ``  deficit '' observed in high - redshift smgs and quasar hosts is most probably _ not _ related to simple observational selection effects in the fir or sub - mm regime , but rather to the morphology of the sf activity . specifically , high - redshift quasar hosts exhibit more compact starburst - like sf activity , with /@xmath176  ratios as low as observed in lower - redshift ulirgs .",
    "interestingly , our measurements show that the /@xmath176  ratio in the three interacting quasar hosts is significantly lower than that found in their companion smgs .",

    "moreover , this demonstrates that the -deficit in high - redshift quasar hosts is driven by local properties of the ism and the uv radiation field _ within _ the host galaxies , and not by larger scale effects .",
    "indeed , several studies have emphasized that lower /@xmath176",
    "ratios are expected to be found in regions with higher sf densities , similar to starbursts  consistent with what is observed ( e.g. , @xcite ; see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the alma data for some of our sources do _ not _ seem to support this explanation . in particular , the hosts of j1328 and j0935 have virtually identical  and -emitting region sizes , but  ( and therefore /@xmath176 ) in j1328 is twice as high as in j0935 .",
    "similarly , the hosts of j0331 and j0923 have very similar , and /@xmath176  in the latter is higher than in the former by merely 30% . however , the -emitting region in j0923 is larger by a factor of roughly four than the one in j0331 .",
    "thus , our alma data do not seem to support a simple scenario where /@xmath176  is mainly controlled by the size of the  emitting region ,",
    "however , higher resolution data are needed to critically address this idea .",
    "the ( rest - frame ) fir continuum emission observed within the new alma data can be used to estimate the total fir emission and therefore the sfr of the quasar hosts and the accompanying smgs .",
    "this obviously requires additional assumptions regarding the shape of the fir sed .",
    "we expect that the agn - related contribution to the fir sed is small , on the level of 10% , at most .",
    "this assumption is based on several detailed studies of the mid - to - far ir seds of luminous agn across a wide luminosity range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "given the uncertainties related to the sed shape ( see below ) and in order to be consistent with other alma studies of high - redshift quasar hosts , we choose to neglect the ( small ) possible agn contribution to the fir seds of our sources .",
    "we have reconstructed the fir seds of our sources following two different approaches .",
    "first , we adopted the procedure used in several recent studies of fir emission in high - redshift quasar hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and have assumed a gray - body sed with dust temperature @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this single temperature dust model is a crude approximation to the more realistic case where dust with a range of temperatures contribute to the observed emission ( for a detailed discussion see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "second , we have used the grid of fir seds provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ce01 hereafter ) .",
    "this grid includes 105 templates spanning a wide range in ir luminosity . as the templates have no free parameters , we have simply identified the template that best matches the alma continuum measurement ( i.e. , monochromatic luminosity ) for each source . this also provides a specific value of total ir ( tir ) luminosity , @xmath184 . in the fir luminosity regime of interest ,",
    "the uncertainties on the alma continuum measurements are typically consistent with , or smaller than , the differences between adjacent fir templates .",
    "the main limitation of this approach is that the template library was constructed to account for low - redshift sf galaxies .",
    "however , the small number of available data points does not warrant the use of other sets of templates .    in we",
    "present the alma continuum measurements and the  data from n14 , along with the two previously mentioned types of fir seds .",
    "the low spatial resolution of the  data means that these flux measurements also include the emission from any accompanying continuum sources for the systems where these are resolved by alma .",
    "we therefore also show in a scaled - down version of the  data points , assuming the relative flux densities of the different neighboring sources follow those of the alma measurements .",
    "as shows , the gray - body seds are generally in good agreement with the previous  data . in particular , in the observed - frame 350 @xmath49 m  band ( rest - frame wavelength of roughly 60 @xmath49 m ) , the alma - based seds for two of the fir - bright systems ( j1341 and j1511 ) differ from the  data by less than 0.05 dex ( for either the gray - body or ce01 seds ) . for the third fir - bright object , j0331 ,",
    "the luminosities expected from the alma - based seds are significantly lower , by factors of about 2 and 3 , than the fluxes observed with  for the gray - body and ce01 seds , respectively .",
    "since this source has no detectable companions in the alma data , we suggest that this discrepancy can only be attributed to the uncertainty on the exact shape of the sed , and perhaps to the limited quality of the  data .",
    "below we investigate how a gray - body sed with a different ( higher ) temperature may account for this discrepancy . for the fir - faint sources ,",
    "the comparison between the alma - based seds and the  data is obviously less straightforward , as the  data represent the stacked signal coming from a much larger sample of sources for which the existence of companions that may contribute to the fir fluxes is unclear . nonetheless , the agreement between the new alma data and the  stacking measurements is respectable . for two of the sources ( j1328 and j0935 )",
    ", the alma - based gray - body seds are consistent within 0.13 dex of the  data ( again at observed - frame 350 @xmath49 m ) . for the third source ( j0923 )",
    ", the gray - body sed over - predicts the luminosity at 350 @xmath49 m  by 0.37 dex , while the ce01 sed agrees with the  data to within less than 0.1 dex . as a sanity check ,",
    "if one ignores the scaling factors related to the companions ( in j0923 and j1328 ) , that is - assume that the stacked  signal was not significantly affected by companions , then the differences between the alma - based gray - body seds and the  data become somewhat smaller .",
    "we have also experimented with both colder and warmer gray - body seds , always `` anchored '' to the new alma data .",
    "the colder seds , with @xmath185 and @xmath186 , identical to those used in n14 , systematically _",

    "however , this high temperature is beyond what is typically observed , even among the most luminous fir sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this may suggest that , in this source , the radiation emerging from the vicinity of the smbh does contribute to heating of galaxy - scale dust , which is not associated with sf regions in the host ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also note that choosing a higher - luminosity template from the ce01 grid would not resolve the discrepancy between the alma and  data for this source , as the highest - luminosity ce01 template that closely matches the  data would significantly over - predict the alma continuum measurement .",
    "we conclude that both the ce01 and fiducial gray - body fir seds ( i.e. , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) provide generally good agreement between the alma and  data .",
    "we therefore chose to use these sets of seds in what follows .",

    "the difference is only slightly larger , @xmath40.13 dex .",

    "the differences between the ce01-based ir luminosities ( and therefore sfrs ) among the fir - bright quasar hosts are of 0.1 dex , at most .",
    "if we instead consider the gray - body seds used in n14 , which assumed @xmath185 and @xmath186 , and employ these sed parameters to our alma data , then the resulting sfrs are , again , in excellent agreement with the n14 ones for two of the systems ( j1341 and j1511 ) .",

    "faint extended  emission may also affect the inclination corrections , though this would probably be a subtle effect .",
    "more importantly , the inclination corrections for marginally resolved extended sources are somewhat sensitive to non - circular beam shapes , as is the case with some of our data . on the other hand",
    ", deeper and higher resolution data may also reveal non - rotating ism components , thus significantly altering the  estimates . as noted in ,",
    "the high central velocity dispersions we observe in our sources are most probably driven by the limited spatial resolution of our alma data and not by such non - rotating components .",
    "even if the ism is indeed mostly found in a rotating disk , then determining the underlying ( central ) velocity dispersion would result in lower @xmath292 , and therefore lower .",
    "some of these effects are clearly demonstrated whenever increasingly deeper observations were obtained for some @xmath17 sub - mm sources ( e.g. , @xcite for j1148 at @xmath293 ; @xcite for bri  0952 - 0115 at @xmath294 ; and @xcite for br  1202 - 0725 at @xmath18 ) . a more detailed discussion of these , and other uncertainties related to  estimates , is also given in @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding these uncertainties and caveats , we proceed to estimate the dynamical masses of the sources in our sample , using the prescription given in . for the quasar hosts , the dynamical masses are in the range of @xmath295 ( see ) .",

    "we further derive rough estimates of the inclination angles based on the observed morphology of the  emission in all -emitting systems ( given in ) . for the quasar host of j1511 and the accompanying smg , where the -emitting regions are not formally resolved , we use the upper limits on @xmath290 and @xmath299 .",
    "the inclination angles we deduce for our sources are in the range @xmath300 .",
    "taking these inclination corrections into account , we obtain dynamical masses of @xmath301 for the quasar hosts , while for the companion smgs we have @xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath304 ( for the smgs accompanying j1511 , j0923 , and j1328 , respectively ) .",

    "interestingly , the latter mass is in excellent agreement with the observed `` knee '' of the _ stellar _ mass function in sf galaxies ( @xmath307 ) , which is known to show very limited evolution up to at least @xmath308 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that the dynamical masses of the interacting smgs differ from those of the corresponding quasar hosts by factors of about 0.85 , 0.3 , and 1.8 ( for the j1511 , j0923 , and j1328 systems , respectively ) . given the uncertainties on our  estimates mentioned above , these mass ratios are consistent with our interpretation of these interacting systems being _ major _ galaxy mergers ( see below ) .    to complement our estimates of dynamical masses , we also derive rough estimates of the _ dust _ and _ gas _ masses in our sources .",
    "dust masses are estimated assuming that the fir continuum fluxes measured from our alma data are emitted by optically thin dust , following an sed with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and further assuming an opacity coefficient of @xmath309 ( following @xcite , for consistency with @xcite ; see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dust masses we derive are in the range @xmath310 for the quasar hosts and @xmath311 for the companion smgs .",
    "importantly , the dust masses of the quasar hosts comprise @xmath312 of the dynamical masses .",
    "this qualitative result is virtually independent of the significant uncertainties involved in the dust mass estimates ( due to the assumptions on the seds and on @xmath313 ) .",
    "rough estimates of gas masses can then be inferred by assuming a ( uniform ) gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "these are rather conservative estimates , as several recent studies have shown that the gas - to - dust ratio in high - redshift hosts may be significantly lower ( e.g. , as low as @xmath314 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the gas masses comprise @xmath315 of  and reach @xmath316 in only one quasar host ( j1341 ) . adopting the aforementioned lower gas - to - dust ratios would obviously result in yet lower gas - to - dynamical mass ratios .",

    "are consistent with the sf - ms , being within about 0.2 dex of the aforementioned relation , which is consistent with the intrinsic scatter associated with it .",
    "we now turn to compare the mass growth rates and the masses of the smbhs powering our quasars relative to those of the stellar populations in their host galaxies .    for the quasar host galaxies , we assume that the mass grows only due to the formation of new stars at a rate determined by the ce01-based sfrs ( see above ) . for the smbhs ,",

    "the high  ratios found for the rest of the sample ( four of six quasars ) suggests that in these systems the smbhs are bound to _ _ over__grow the stellar populations . to illustrate the possible evolutionary scenarios for our smbhs and host galaxies , we plot in the expected mass growth in both the bh and stellar components , assuming the observed ( linear ) growth rates are sustained for a short period of 50 myr ( as in *",

    "however , if the bh growth rates are maintained over longer periods , and/or if the smbhs are instead assumed to be growing exponentially ( i.e. , at constant , instead of constant ) , then the smbhs would significantly overgrow their hosts while approaching the highest bh masses known , @xmath334 , and moving away from the local bh - host relation . in this mass regime ,",

    "this study used  data for a large sample of some of the most luminous quasars at @xmath336 ( including all of our sources ) and found that the vast majority of systems has @xmath337 , while a small fraction had @xmath338 . assuming that the most luminous quasars at @xmath336 form a continuously evolving population , the @xcite study also suggested that the epoch of fast smbh growth traced by our sources would extend to @xmath331 , perhaps at low duty cycles ( see t11 ) , while the intense sf activity seen in some of the quasar hosts may decrease shortly after @xmath208 . in the context of the @xmath0  quasars we study here",
    ", this may indeed mean that our smbhs would reach the high end of the known  range , with @xmath334 .",
    "the ( decreasing ) sf activity is still required to suffice to reach @xmath335 .",

    "all this suggests that the smbh is approaching its final mass , while the host galaxy is forming stars at an intense rate and the system would likely expected to approach the high mass end of the @xmath342 mass ratio ( see ) .",
    "this is similar to the over - massive bh cid-947 , recently identified at @xmath343 , and speculated to have experienced an earlier episode of fast eddington - limited growth , to reach the observed @xmath344 and @xmath345 @xcite .  and",
    "cid-947 at @xmath343 ) are drawn from parent samples of markedly different number densities . ]",
    "j1341 may therefore be illustrative of the scenario of early , fast smbh growth to the highest known mass well before @xmath346 , with somewhat longer timescale stellar growth , to eventually reach @xmath335 .",
    "given the results of  analysis available prior to the new alma observations , the naive expectation for the sample under study was that the fir - bright sources are powered by major mergers between gas - rich galaxies , while the fir - faint sources are evolving secularly or , perhaps , are related to a _ later _ evolutionary phase , where the accreting smbhs may have already affected the sf in their hosts ( see n14 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "moreover , there is strong evidence that the occurrence rate of mergers among agn increases with increasing agn luminosity and redshift @xcite . based on these trends , a high occurrence rate of mergers , in excess of @xmath347 and perhaps as high as @xmath348 ,",
    "is expected for our @xmath0 , high-  ( and high- ) quasars .",
    "the new high - resolution alma data allow us to critically revisit these ideas .",
    "the small size of our sample naturally limits the scope of our interpretation , however we note that most of the previous studies addressing these questions at comparably high redshifts included yet fewer objects and/or relied on lower - quality data .    at face value ,",
    "our new alma data clearly show that a significant fraction of @xmath0  luminous quasars ",
    "50% in our small sample  are interacting with companion galaxies of comparable mass , thus supporting the idea that major mergers are a dominant driver of the intense bh and sf activity .",
    "moreover , we note that this may constitute a lower limit on the real fraction of interacting quasar hosts , when considering the possibility that additional companions are locate just outside of the alma fields ( i.e. , separated by @xmath349 kpc ) ; that additional close companions are too faint to be detected in our alma data ( i.e. , have @xmath350 ) and/or that some of the isolated quasars are actually in the final stages of a merger with interaction signatures that can only be detected with higher resolution data . however , the properties of the smbhs in our sample , their hosts and companion galaxies under study , highlight several shortcomings of the simplistic merger - driven growth scenario .",
    "first , two of the three quasars with robust detections of physically interacting companions ( i.e. , smgs ) are actually among the fir-_faint _ sources , while only one of the fir - bright sources has an interacting companion ( j1511 ) .",
    "second , the velocity maps of all the fir - bright systems , and particularly those that lack companions , show evidence for ordered rotation , around an axis that coincides with the centroids of the host galaxies ( and quasars locations ; see and ) .",
    "the coincidence of the region of zero velocity with the centroids of the sf activity in the hosts suggests that the redshifted and blueshifted  emitting regions are _ not _ tracing ( smaller ) coalescing galaxies .",
    "moreover , as noted in , the outer parts of the ism in the fir - bright systems appear to be rotation dominated .",
    "this is also seen among the fir - faint systems , although to a lesser extent .",
    "we also note that the speculation made in n14 that the fir - faint systems are found in a _ later _ evolutionary stage is disfavored by the new alma data , as ( two of ) the fir - faint systems are seen to be in a rather early stage of a major merger .",
    "their lower sfrs will therefore likely increase as the interacting galaxies coalesce . in principle , a possible interpretation for our new alma data may have been that the smbh activity in the fir - faint sources is driven by the `` first passage '' of the interacting quasar hosts with their smg companions .",
    "indeed , the high sfrs of the interacting galaxies in the j1511 system may be indicative of what the fir - faint systems would undergo in later stages of the interaction . however , most simulations of major mergers suggest that the smbh would produce a luminous quasar , with high , at the final coalescence phase , and _ not _ in the first passage phase .",
    "these same simulations also suggest that the first passage enhances sfr in the interacting hosts , to levels comparable to those found in the later , final coalescence phase ( see , e.g. , @xcite , but also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our sample , on the other hand , shows similarly intense smbh growth , with @xmath351 and @xmath352 , for both high- and low - sfr quasar hosts and among systems with and without an interacting companion . any direct comparison with merger simulations is further complicated by the possibility that the companion smgs we detect at larger separations of @xmath353 may have already experienced a much closer passage to the quasar hosts and are observed close to their apocenter .",
    "the intense smbh growth may have been triggered during this pericenter passage , when tidal forces were maximal . in this context",
    ", we note that any observations of interacting galaxies would be biased toward large separations , due to the longer periods spent at increasingly larger separations .",
    "indeed , an inspection of several of the aforementioned simulations suggests that the interacting galaxies are separated by @xmath354 for over 80% of the simulated merger .",
    "first and second passages are extremely short , taking up @xmath355 of the time . , may therefore be even higher . ]",
    "we therefore conclude that our alma data provide compelling evidence for significant galaxy  galaxy interactions ( major mergers ) in some , but not all , quasar hosts .",
    "moreover , the links between these interactions and the intense accretion onto the smbhs remains unclear .",
    "for the fir - bright sources , we caution that even with the new alma data , we can not completely disprove the possibility that _ all _ these systems are indeed observed in the advanced stages of a major merger . in particular , the evidence for rotation in the ism of some quasar hosts does not by itself disprove a merger scenario , as several studies of low - redshift mergers ( i.e. , ulirgs ) have identified nuclear structures of rotating molecular gas , on scales of a few kiloparsecs ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) . simulations of ( low - redshift ) major mergers have demonstrated that such gas disks may indeed form several hundreds of myr after the `` peak '' of the merger , once the coalesced nucleus has relaxed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the interacting companions we identify among the fir - faint systems can not be related to the sf and smbh activity in a straightforward way , given their large separations . the only way in which _ all _ the quasars in our sample can be explained as triggered by major merger is if the fir - bright systems that lack an interacting companion ( namely j0331 and j1341 ) are observed in the final coalescence stage , while the two interacting fir - faint quasar hosts have already experienced a close first passage that triggered the smbh growth and are observed close to their apocenter .",
    "even this scenario fails to account for one of the fir - faint systems ( j0935 ) , which has no companions out to @xmath356 .",
    "several sub - mm studies published in recent years have probed the existence of sf galaxies that are accompanying , or indeed interacting with , the hosts of @xmath357 quasars .",
    "a prominent example is the interacting system br1202 - 0725 at @xmath18 , which was shown to consist of a pair of interacting smgs , separated by 25 kpc , one of which hosting a luminous quasar , with an additional ( marginal ) detection of a faint agn in the other one @xcite .",
    "however , such close interactions are found to be quite rare among high - redshift quasars .",
    "several deep optical imaging campaigns in the fields around the known @xmath140 quasars provide no or little robust evidence for physically associated companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the sub - mm ( alma and pdbi ) studies published for most of the known @xmath358 quasars ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  which could have detected companions with sfrs comparable to those we find at separations of up to @xmath4100 kpc  report _ no _ such companions .    taken at face value",
    ", this may suggest a fast increase in the occurrence of mergers among luminous quasar hosts between @xmath359  and @xmath0   that is , within @xmath4350 myr .",
    "we note , however , that this discrepancy may be driven by the limited sensitivity and/or limited spatial resolution of the available sub - mm ( alma ) data for some @xmath359  quasars ( e.g. , @xmath44 kpc in @xcite ) .",
    "additional deep observations of these @xmath359  sources at sub - kiloparsec resolution may indeed resolve this discrepancy .    to conclude the discussion of major mergers",
    ", we recall that our smbhs  as well as the other @xmath17 quasars mentioned above  had to grow continuously and at high rates since very early epochs to account for their high masses ( see t11 , and references therein ) . given the number of interacting companions we find and their separations from the quasars hosts , it seems unlikely that this kind of mergers can be the only driver of such a prolonged period of fast growth .",
    "all of the above suggests the epoch of fastest growth of the most massive bhs is driven , at least in part , by mechanisms that are not related to major mergers - such as direct accretion of igm gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , minor mergers , and/or galaxy - scale instabilities of the gas or stellar components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , we note that even if the companion smgs we find are not directly related to the fueling of the fast - growing @xmath0  smbhs , their presence seems to support the idea that rapid early bh growth preferentially takes place in dense large - scale environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to date",
    ", such evidence has been highly elusive , with several observational campaigns looking for over - densities of ( rest - frame ) uv - bright galaxies around luminous high - redshift quasars yielding highly ambiguous results ( see , e.g. , @xcite for several examples of such over - dense environments , but also @xcite and some of the systems in @xcite for the contrary ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that such studies may be significantly biased against dust - obscured high - redshift sf galaxies , thus underestimating the real ( over-)density of galaxies around high - redshift quasars .",
    "indeed , the three interacting companions we identify were _ not _ identified in the  images of the respective quasars ( n14 ) . a complete census of the cosmic environments of high - redshift , fast - growing smbhs would therefore require a multi - wavelength approach , covering scales of up to a few arc - minutes , and in spectral regimes that are not affected by dust obscuration .",
    "this can be done , for example , using compact sub - mm arrays .",
    "we have presented alma band-7  observations of  luminous quasars at @xmath0 , drawn from a sample of 40 , uv - selected sdss quasars with a wealth of supporting multi - wavelength data .",
    "the data probe the rest - frame far - ir continuum emission that arises from cold dust , heated by sf in the host galaxies of the quasars , as well as the  emission line that originates from the cold phase of the hosts ism .",

    "our main findings are as follows .    1 .",
    "all quasar hosts are clearly detected and resolved , in both continuum and  line emission .",
    "the continuum emission suggests intense sf , with the fir - bright sources reaching @xmath361 , consistent with  observations of these systems .",
    "the quasar hosts exhibit evidence for massive , rotation - dominated gas structures .",
    "2 .   three quasar hosts ",
    "one fir - bright and two fir - faint systems  are accompanied by spectroscopically confirmed , interacting companions , with separations in the range @xmath362 kpc  and within @xmath363 .",
    "the companions themselves are forming stars at rates of a few hundred yr^-1 @xmath5 , slightly lower than the quasar hosts with which they interact .",
    "the remaining quasar hosts  two fir - bright and one fir - faint  lack significant companions .",
    "this , combined with the evidence for rotation , may suggest that processes other than major mergers are driving the significant sf activity and fast smbh growth in these systems .",
    "the dynamical masses of the quasar hosts , estimated from the  lines , are within a factor of @xmath43 of the masses of the interacting companions , supporting our interpretation of these interactions as major mergers .",
    "the -based dynamical masses also show that the fir - faint systems are consistent with the `` main sequence '' of star - forming galaxies , while the fir - bright systems are located above it .",
    "compared with the bh masses , the -based dynamical host masses are generally lower than what is expected from the locally observed bh - to - host mass ratio . in some of the systems ,",
    "this discrepancy may grow further , given the high accretion rates of the smbhs .",
    "the /@xmath176  ratios in the quasar hosts are consistent with those found in other @xmath17 quasar hosts and smgs and follow the observed trend of declining /@xmath176  with increasing .",
    "although our data suggest that the  deficit is most probably driven by mechanisms or properties that are intrinsic to the quasar hosts , we do not find evidence for the compactness of the sf regions being the driver of the @xmath364 trend .",
    "our analysis clearly demonstrates the wide variety of host galaxy properties , particularly in terms of sfrs and of possible smbh fueling mechanisms , among a relatively uniform population of the fastest - growing smbhs in the early gas - rich universe .",
    "it appears that vigorous smbh growth is not necessarily accompanied by extreme sf activity ( i.e. , above what is found in inactive sf galaxies ) and that galaxy  galaxy interactions are not a necessary condition for either of the two processes .",
    "this broadly supports a scenario where intense smbh and stellar growth in the early universe is driven by secular processes , such as large - scale flows of cold gas , that penetrate into the centers of massive dark matter halos and/or gas or stellar instabilities on smaller scales .",
    "our results motivate several paths for follow - up studies to address and test the predictions of the different fueling mechanisms . to robustly determine",
    "the role of mergers in the systems that lack companions quasars would require the detection of tidal features ( e.g. , using  imaging ) , or mapping the ism kinematics at higher resolution and/or to larger scales ( i.e. , with deeper alma observations ) .",
    "obviously , a critical test of the relevance of mergers to the general population of high - redshift quasars necessitates a significantly larger sample , with observations that cover a large field of view while maintaining a high spatial resolution .",
    "this can be achieved by extending our analysis to additional @xmath208 and @xmath365 quasars .",

    "<S> our sample consists of three `` fir - bright '' sources which were individually detected in previous /spire observations , with star formation rates of @xmath3 , and three `` fir - faint '' sources for which  stacking analysis implies a typical sfr of @xmath4400 yr^-1 @xmath5 . the dusty interstellar medium in the hosts of all six quasars is clearly detected in the alma data and resolved on scales of @xmath42 kpc , in both continuum ( @xmath6 ) and  line emission . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum emission is in good agreement with the expectations from the  data , confirming the intense sf activity in the quasar hosts . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we detect companion sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) for three sources  one fir - bright and two fir - faint , separated by @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the quasar hosts . </S>",
    "<S> the -based dynamical mass estimates for the interacting smgs are within a factor of @xmath43 of the quasar hosts masses , while the continuum emission implies @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our alma data therefore clearly support the idea that major mergers are important drivers for rapid early smbh growth . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that not all high - sfr quasar hosts are accompanied by interacting smgs and the gas kinematics as observed by alma suggest that other processes may be fueling these systems . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis thus demonstrates the diversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated with early and rapid smbh growth . </S>"
