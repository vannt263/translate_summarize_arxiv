    "almost one hundred years ago , s. muchopadhyaya discovered two theorems on plane ovals ( an oval is a smooth closed strictly convex plane curve ) .",
    "the first one is known as the four - vertex theorem : the curvature of a plane oval has at least 4 critical points .",
    "these critical points are the points at which the osculating circles are hyperosculating , that is , are third - order tangent to the curve . the second theorem concerns osculating conics and states that a smooth convex closed curve has at least 6 distinct points at which the osculating conics are hyperosculating .",
    "such points are called sextactic .",
    "a smooth plane curve can be approximated by a conic at every point up to order 4 ; a point is sextactic if the order of approximation at this point is higher .",

    "it is natural to expect that there exist multi - dimensional versions of four- and six - vertex theorems but , so far , only the very first steps have been made in this direction @xcite .",

    "this conjecture states that a sufficiently smooth convex closed surface in @xmath1 has at least 2 distinct umbilic points , that is , the points where the two principal curvatures are equal ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for a long and convoluted history of the subject ) .",
    "umbilic points are analogs of vertices of plane curves : these are the points at which a sphere is abnormally ( second - order ) tangent to the surface .",

    "a smooth hypersurface @xmath2 in @xmath0 can be approximated by a quadric at every point up to order 2 .",
    "a point @xmath3 is called _ quadratic _ if @xmath2 can be approximated by a quadric at @xmath4 up to order 3 .",
    "we view quadratic points of surfaces as 2-dimensional analogs of sextactic points .",
    "quadratic points were studied in the classical literature , see @xcite , but we are aware of only one existence result : if a generic smooth surface in @xmath0 contains a hyperbolic disc , bounded by a jordan parabolic curve , then there exists an odd number of quadratic points inside this disc ( and hence , at least one ) @xcite .",
