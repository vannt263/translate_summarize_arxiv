    "@xmath6 , the adiabatic approximation decouples the evolution of the instantaneous eigenspaces of @xmath0 . in the present approximation ,",
    "the eigenspace structure of @xmath7 still plays a role in that it determines what should decouple in the adiabatic limit .",
    "it turns out that this in general limits the applicability to systems that are weakly open , i.e. , to small @xmath4 .",

    "@xcite , as it allows degeneracy of the hamiltonian , which is an essential feature to obtain non - abelian holonomy effects in general @xcite and holonomic quantum computation @xcite in particular .",

    "first of all it should be noted that , although the jordan decomposition always exists , it could be challenging to determine it in practice for more than a limited class of disturbances and systems . furthermore , for the approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite a new jordan decomposition has to be calculated for each choice of disturbance of the ideal gate . in the present approach , where the eigenspaces of the hamiltonian are primary , the approximate equation can be obtained irrespective of the form of the disturbance @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spectral decomposition of @xmath7 is in general known for holonomic implementations of quantum gates . for other applications ,",
    "however , the preferred method of approximation has to be decided from the specific problem at hand .",
    "another generalization of adiabaticity to open systems has been considered in @xcite , but for a specific type of open systems in the context of quantum adiabatic search .",
