    "more than one billion people do not have electricity access @xcite , largely because of insufficient centralized power systems in developing countries .",
    "the need for electricity in remote and rural areas and the evolving demands on the existing bulk power infrastructure have driven extensive development of microgrids in recent years .",
    "microgrids naturally incorporate distributed renewable sources and are inherently decentralized . however , designing and installing a microgrid to electrify an off - grid community typically requires specialized planning .",
    "electrical networks which could be formed by the ad hoc interconnection of modular power sources and loads by non - specialist users would remove barriers to energy access , allowing decentralized electricity markets to proliferate in an unprecedented manner .",
    "broadly , the critical challenges of ad hoc microgrids are :    1 .",
    "the microgrid components ( power sources , loads , and lines ) should be designed so that _ any _ network formed by connecting many units _ always _ has an appropriate and stable equilibrium point , 2 .",
    "the sources should be controlled in a coordinated and decentralized manner to manage power dispatch , and 3 .",
    "the system should function entirely autonomously under significant uncertainty regarding the network configuration and power supply and demand .    to evaluate stability , traditional power system operators use computationally intensive simulations and empirical testing of the pre - determined network topology .",
    "by contrast , ad hoc networks present unique challenges because the network topology is not specified . instead , analytic constraints on the individual source , load , and line units_independent from the interconnection structure_must be developed such that , when satisfied , they guarantee the existence , feasibility , and stability of an equilibrium point .",
    "this is different from previous stability analyses in power electronics , which have relied on impedance measurements , used overly simplified network models , or placed unrealistic constraints on the network configuration @xcite .",
    "an additional complication is the widespread and increasing use of power electronic devices , which draw constant power at their inputs to regulate their outputs .",
    "the negative incremental impedance ( @xmath0 ) of these loads has a well - documented destabilizing effect on power systems @xcite .",
    "the effect of constant power loads on stability has attracted recent interest in the controls community ( @xcite ) but has not yet been analyzed in the context of ad hoc systems .    to plan and coordinate power dispatch , traditional ac power system operators compute the optimal dispatch based on the marginal costs of the generators , and each generator realizes its assigned power output by controlling the phase angle between its output voltage and current .",
    "ad hoc systems again present unique challenges because of the combination of the need for decentralized computation and control and the uncertainty in power supply and demand . in dc systems powered by voltage - source converters ,",
    "each source realizes its assigned power output by controlling its voltage level .",
    "a set of control techniques , organized into a hierarchy , has been widely used in ac and dc microgrids to accomplish these objectives @xcite , and economically optimal dispatch strategies for dc microgrids have been considered @xcite , but again , not in the context of nonlinear ad hoc systems .    in this paper , we develop design - friendly conditions on both the total system load and the individual source , load , and line units under which microgrids composed of these units will have a suitable and stable equilibrium point .",
    "our conditions are summarized by eqs .",
    ", , and . they are more flexible and better suited to a priori device design than previous stability criteria , and rely on techniques from nonlinear control theory @xcite .",
    "we also propose a decentralized control strategy which achieves precise power sharing and voltage regulation , and include a simulated comparison to a well - known power electronics benchmark . throughout ,",

    "we denote the subset of vertex indices corresponding to loads as @xmath20 with @xmath21 and the subset of source indices as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "load @xmath24 is represented by the parallel connection of a capacitance @xmath25 and a constant power load drawing power @xmath26 . in general ,",
    "constant power loads represent perfectly - regulated power converters , and hence are conservative and general models which can be used to describe many power electronic devices .",
    "the capacitor across the input of the power converter is a standard feature of these converters , and is critical for system stability @xcite .",

    "each source voltage is described by :    @xmath31    which reduces to @xmath32 as @xmath30 .",
    "finally , we introduce a simplified control method for @xmath28 , mainly to demonstrate how the stability of source voltage control strategies can be rigorously analyzed :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the nominal network voltage and @xmath35 is a control parameter ( chosen instead of the more conventional @xmath36 for dimensional convenience ) .",

    "in this section we analyze the stability of arbitrary interconnections of sources , loads , and lines , under the assumption that each source is controlled according to eq . .",

    "we formulate the dynamical equations in a structured way so that we can apply the classic results by brayton and moser regarding the stability of nonlinear circuits @xcite to ad hoc networks .",

    "these equations expose the fundamental structure of the system and will be used in the next section to analyze system stability .",
    "stability of the system can be certified by noticing that the combination of eq . and",

    "the second condition is automatically satisfied because @xmath52 is affine in @xmath67 , while the first condition is equivalent to @xmath75 and can be satisfied by imposing certain constraints on the network and the operating point which are discussed below .",

    "notably , these conditions can be also interpreted as the contraction behavior of the underlying dynamics @xcite ( see also example 3.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "going beyond asymptotic stability is extremely challenging .",
    "explicit construction of the attraction regions or their approximations is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , a simple univariate form of nonlinearity @xmath82 suggests that the approaches based on sector bounding of nonlinear terms , recently used for characterization of the attraction regions in ac power systems ( see @xcite ) may be appropriate for this problem as well .    in summary , existence , feasibility and stability of at least one operating point",
    "is certified as long as the following three conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "there exist equilibrium voltage vectors @xmath83 that satisfy @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and all load voltages satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "the equilibrium current vector is then given by @xmath87 .",
    "the hessian of the resistive co - content is positive definite at the equilibrium point : @xmath88 .",
    "the matrix @xmath62 is positive semidefinite at the operating point .",
    "our definition of @xmath55 guarantees that @xmath89 , so positive semidefiniteness of @xmath90 reduces to @xmath91 .",
    "whenever the three conditions above hold , the stability of an operating point follows directly from lasalle s invariance principle .",
    "the criteria derived in section [ sec : dynamics ] can be applied directly to any power system with a specified network structure . however , for ad hoc networks , these criteria must be reformulated in terms of individual components  removing the dependence on @xmath7which we do in this section .",
    "we begin with a few basic assumptions :    1 .",
    "the network graph is strongly connected .",
    "[ cond : conn ] 2 .",
    "there is at least one source .",
    "[ cond : gen ] 3 .",
    "the total power consumption of all the loads is bounded from above : @xmath92 .",
    "the total resistance of all lines is bounded from above : @xmath93 .",
    "the equilibrium conditions for the system ( eq . ) can be rewritten in a more traditional load - flow form :    [ eq : equi ] @xmath94    sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to these load flow equations have been recently proposed in @xcite and later extended to a number of other settings in a series of follow - up works including @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the solution of eq .",
    "is guaranteed to exist whenever the total load is bounded by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the effective impedance matrix , which in our notation could be written as @xmath97 with @xmath98 being the submatrix of @xmath7 corresponding to load buses .",
    "the expression @xmath99 also admits a simple interpretation .",
    "whenever a current @xmath100 is injected at load bus @xmath24 , the voltage on this bus rises by @xmath101 .",
    "then @xmath102the maximal effective resistance between the load and source buses . from the assumptions stated above , the maximum resistance between two nodes can not exceed @xmath103 , and hence @xmath104 .",
    "this upper bound is reached when a single generator and a single load are separated by a power line of resistance @xmath103 , so that is the `` worst case '' topology with respect to that condition . we conclude that , in the presence of uncertainty regarding the network structure , the solution to eq . is guaranteed to exist if and only if the maximum network load satisfies :    @xmath105      in addition to the existence of an equilibrium point , power systems typically also have a minimum voltage level requirement such that @xmath106 on every load bus . in practical systems , this requirement ( `` feasibility '' of an equilibrium point ) is stricter than the condition for existence of an equilibrium point .",
    "the corresponding design constraint can be derived using the expression for the voltage level :    @xmath107    hence , we obtain a quadratic inequality for @xmath108 .",
    "as long as the upper voltage solution to the load flow equations exists , it will be feasible when the following condition is satisfied : @xmath109 this condition is more restrictive than as long as @xmath110 .",
    "inequality becomes binding for the same `` worst case '' scenario as described above .",
    "next , we consider the condition for positive - definiteness of the hessian of the bm potential at the equilibrium point : @xmath111 .",
    "we introduce a path - decomposition of the graph characterized by the matrix @xmath112 with elements @xmath113 .",
    "the values of @xmath114 are chosen to define the path from some source bus @xmath115 to bus @xmath24 .",
    "then , the voltage on bus @xmath24 can be represented as :    @xmath116    for convenience , we define another node in the original graph and assign it index @xmath117 .",
    "this `` virtual node '' is placed between the voltage source ( @xmath118 ) and droop resistance ( @xmath119 ) and creates an extra edge with index @xmath120 with edge impedance @xmath121 .",
    "this edge connects the virtual node @xmath122 to the pre - existing node @xmath123 . assuming that the corresponding incidence and path - decomposition matrices are denoted as @xmath124 and @xmath125 we can write @xmath126 and can be rewritten as @xmath127 , or    @xmath128    the quadratic form corresponding to @xmath129 acting on an arbitrary vector @xmath4 can be written : @xmath130    we have introduced a current @xmath131 and an effective load conductance @xmath132 that satisfies @xmath133 , so the total load conductance satisfies @xmath134 .",
    "these observations allow us to bound the last term of with the help of the jensen s inequality : @xmath135    therefore , the quadratic form in is non - negative whenever the total load power and total network resistance satisfy a constraint on the maximum power demand : @xmath136    again , the `` worst case '' network configuration for this condition is the maximally separated single source and load .",
    "this condition is typically less restrictive than , however it can be binding in microgrids that rely on large values of @xmath29 ( larger @xmath29 values are often used for coordinated microgrid control ",
    "see section [ sec : control ] ) .      the condition @xmath137 , with @xmath62 defined in eq .",
    ", can be rewritten as : @xmath138 this is always satisfied for sources .",
    "it is satisfied for loads as long as the equilibrium voltage is bounded from below by @xmath86 and the total power consumption of the load is bounded from above : @xmath139 as a result , there is a trade - off between load power draw and required input capacitance . in practice ,",
    "@xmath26 is bounded from above by converter device ratings , so @xmath25 can be sized according to the maximum converter capacity .    in summary , we have derived three simple criteria ( , , and ) which can guarantee that an equilibrium point will exist , be feasible , and be asymptotically stable for any network structure .",
    "together , these three constraints define the set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the arbitrary interconnection of sources , loads , and lines is guaranteed to be stable_regardless of the network topology_.",
    "the conditions derived in sections [ sec : dynamics ] and [ sec : existence ] ensure that a feasible operating point exists for all admissible network topologies and loading levels .",
    "in addition to stable operation , there are two more objectives that are critical for allowing multiple sources to cooperate when connected to the same microgrid :    1",
    ".   each source must be able to set and update its fraction of total supplied power ( `` dynamic load sharing '' ) , and 2 .",
    "node voltages @xmath140 must be maintained near the nominal network voltage @xmath34 .    when multiple sources are connected without coordinated control ,",
    "the steady - state fraction of total power each supplies is fixed and is determined by the line resistances .",
    "this is not ideal  being able to control the relative power output of each source is a basic prerequisite for more advanced functionality , like economically - optimal power dispatch .",
    "we assume that a vector of optimal power sharing proportions @xmath141 has been computed from some arbitrary set of cost functions and analyze how to realize the desired power dispatch . with @xmath142 defined as the participation factor that source @xmath24 supplies , relative to the average",
    ", the power sharing objective is given by :    @xmath143    at the same time , the network voltage must be regulated . to quantify this objective ,",
    "we define @xmath144 as the average of the source node voltages .",
    "our objective is to maintain this average at the desired network voltage @xmath34 :    @xmath145    note that : 1 ) if the loads also have communication capabilities they could also be included in @xmath146 , and 2 ) much of the microgrid control literature ( including @xcite ) considers only two - source , one - load networks when formulating their control strategies and states their objective in terms of the single load voltage : @xmath147 .",
    "where applicable , we have replaced @xmath148 with the more general @xmath146 .      to manage complexity , microgrid control",
    "is typically separated into a hierarchy of strategies operating on different timescales and with different objectives .",
    "the standard strategy @xcite , which is well - known and widely - cited , is summarized below , and consists of :    1 .",
    "individual ( uncoordinated ) control of each power converter , which , for voltage - source converters , realizes the output voltage @xmath140 .",
    "2 .   droop control , which modifies @xmath140 proportionally to the output current , mimicking a resistor .",
    "the goal of droop control is achieving power sharing .",
    "3 .   secondary voltage control , which increases @xmath28 to offset the voltage drop caused by droop control . in its standard form , secondary voltage control only regulates the network voltage . in our proposed control strategy , it also improves power sharing .",
    "4 .   tertiary control , which interfaces the microgrid with another power system .",
    "tertiary control is outside the scope of this work .      when sources and loads are connected without coordinated control , the amount of power each source supplies is determined by the network configuration and line resistances .",
    "to modify the power sharing of the sources , a `` virtual resistance '' @xmath29 is inserted at the output of each converter .",
    "@xmath29 is a control parameter internal to the power electronic device and hence _ does not _ dissipate power . for optimal performance , @xmath29 must be much greater than the line resistances so that the impact of the line resistance on the power sharing is negligible . in practice ,",
    "@xmath149 is typically not obtainable because larger @xmath29 values increase the node voltage deviation : @xmath150 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : source ] as @xmath30 ) .",
    "this means that droop control alone can not achieve arbitrary power sharing proportions , but it remains a popular control strategy because it is simple and does not require communication if all @xmath29 values are fixed ( however , to update the power sharing proportions , the @xmath29 values must also be updated ) .      to mitigate the voltage deviations caused by droop control , proportional - integral control can be used to restore the network voltage level . the standard way of achieving this is by increasing @xmath28 until equation is satisfied :    @xmath151    in this way , all the @xmath28 values change in response to a global error signal , and under the usual assumption that @xmath152 for all sources , all @xmath28 values are identical and the secondary voltage control does not affect power sharing .      for reasons mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : droop ] , droop control alone is not sufficient to achieve the power sharing objective ( eq . ) .",
    "here , we propose a new method of secondary voltage control that ensures accurate power sharing in addition to network voltage regulation .",
    "we accomplish this by varying the @xmath28 values independently , rather than enforcing equal @xmath28 values across all sources , and combining the two control objectives into a single integral controller :    @xmath153    with @xmath154 .",
    "this is a simple controller that adjusts @xmath28 in response to the observed power and voltage levels .",
    "it is based on the observation that increasing @xmath28 increases both the node voltage @xmath140 and the power output of the @xmath24th source .",
    "the conditions for stability of this method are still unknown ; the scheme does not possess the primal - dual structure that was exploited to directly certify the stability of the uncoordinated sources described by .",
    "however , the contraction interpretation of the lyapunov function is potentially generalizable to more sophisticated controls like with proper adjustment of the contraction metric .",
    "in particular , the extension of the original contraction analysis to singular systems , developed in @xcite , provides a natural framework for estimating the stability constraints on the controller gains @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the required communication speed and volume is an important metric when comparing microgrid control strategies .",
    "both secondary voltage methods require all sources to share their voltage values to compute @xmath146 .",
    "in addition , the proposed strategy requires communication of the source currents .",
    "accordingly , the proposed strategy requires messages which are approximately twice as long ( voltage _ and _ current of all sources ) but no additional bandwidth .",
    "further nonidealities , including communication bandwidth and delays , are not analyzed here .",

    "<S> ad hoc electrical networks are formed by connecting power sources and loads without pre - determining the network topology . </S>",
    "<S> these systems are well - suited to addressing the lack of electricity in rural areas because they can be assembled and modified by non - expert users without central oversight . </S>",
    "<S> there are two core aspects to ad hoc system design : 1 ) designing source and load units such that the microgrid formed from the arbitrary interconnection of many units is always stable and 2 ) developing control strategies to autonomously manage the microgrid ( i.e. , perform power dispatch and voltage regulation ) in a decentralized manner and under large uncertainty . to address these challenges we apply a number of nonlinear control techniques  </S>",
    "<S> including brayton - moser potential theory and primal - dual dynamics  to obtain conditions under which an ad hoc dc microgrid will have a suitable and asymptotically stable equilibrium point . </S>",
    "<S> further , we propose a new decentralized control scheme that coordinates many sources to achieve a specified power dispatch from each . a simulated comparison to previous research is included . </S>"
