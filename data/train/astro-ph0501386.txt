    "be / x - ray transients , the most common type of accreting x - ray pulsar system , consist of a pulsar and a be ( or oe ) star , a main sequence star of spectral type b ( or o ) that shows balmer emission lines ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review . )",
    "the line emission is believed to be associated with circumstellar material shed by the be star into its equatorial plane by an unknown mass loss process , thought to be related to the rapid rotation of the be star , typically near 70% of the critical break - up velocity @xcite .",
    "near the be star , the equatorial outflow probably forms a quasi - keplerian disk @xcite .",
    "be / x - ray binaries typically show three types of behavior : ( a ) giant outbursts ( or type ii ) , characterized by high luminosities and high spin - up rates ( i.e. , a significant increase in pulse frequency ) , ( b ) normal outbursts ( or type i ) , characterized by lower luminosities , low spin - up rates ( if any ) , and repeated occurrence at the orbital period , and ( c ) quiescence , where the accretion is partially or completely halted @xcite .    for isolated",
    "be stars , variations in the infrared bands are believed to be good indicators of the size of the be star s disk .",
    "however , when the be star is in a binary system with a neutron star , the be disk is truncated at a resonance radius by tidal forces from the orbit of the neutron star @xcite . in these systems , as the disk can not easily change size because of the truncation radius , changes in mass loss from the be star produce changes in the disk density , which can even become optically thick at infrared wavelengths ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in most systems",
    "there is no clear correlation between x - ray outbursts and optical activity within single outbursts .",
    "the x - ray activity however , follows the long - term optical activity cycle of the be star , in the sense that no outbursts occur in periods where optical indicators of the be star disk , such as @xmath1 emission , have disappeared .",
    "periods of x - ray quiescence when the be disk is present are also observed ; these may be due to the truncation of the be star disk well within the neutron star orbit @xcite .",
    "exo 2030 + 375 is a 42-second transient accreting x - ray pulsar with a b0 ve star companion @xcite discovered during a giant outburst in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the most extensive observations of exo 2030 + 375 were from nearly continuous monitoring of pulse frequency and pulsed flux with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ from 1991 april until 2000 june @xcite .",
    "we @xcite found from batse and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ data that exo 2030 + 375 appeared to have undergone an outburst near most likely every periastron passage for the last 13 years .",
    "our batse observations revealed that exo 2030 + 375 s spin frequency remained roughly constant for about a year , followed by 2 years of spin - up and 6.5 years of spin - down .",
    "the long baseline of x - ray measurements allowed us to make detailed comparisons with optical h@xmath2 and infrared ( ir ) measurements , which led to the following interpretation @xcite : around mjd 49000 , a major reconfiguration occurred in the be star s disk , resulting in a much lower density as indicated by the fainter k - band magnitudes .",
    "the lower density meant less matter was available to be accreted , and as a consequence , the x - ray flux dropped and the spin - up of the neutron star ended . at the same time or shortly after , a density perturbation developed in the disk and started to precess without interacting with the neutron star s orbit . around mjd 50000 the density perturbation interacted with the neutron star s orbit at a phase corresponding to about 2.5 days before periastron , producing x - ray outbursts that peak at that time .",
    "the density perturbation precessed in a prograde direction around the be disk , changing the orbital phase of the outburst peaks . at about mjd 50700 ,",
    "the density perturbation lost contact with the neutron star s orbit in a position symmetrical with respect to periastron , at about 2.5 days after periastron .",
    "this ended the fast migration of the outburst peaks .",
    "@xcite interpreted the trend in the orbital phases from mjd 50000 to 50600 ( 1995 october-1997 june ) in terms of a beat frequency between the orbital period and a perturbation period , assuming that the perturbation period was longer than the orbital period , as is typical for one - armed oscillations ( density perturbations ) , and obtained a perturbation period of @xmath0 years .",
    "in 2002 june ( mjd 52425 - 52446 ) and 2003 september ( mjd 52894 - 52898 ) , we observed two outbursts of exo 2030 + 375 with the _ rxte  _ proportional counter array ( pca ) . for each observation",
    ", we extracted a barycentered light curve using ftools v5.3.1 for pca standard 1 data ( 0.125 sec time resolution , no energy resolution . )",
    "arrival times were corrected using the orbital ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "these data were then fitted with a model consisting of a constant background plus a sixth - order fourier expansion in the pulse phase model , which consisted of a constant barycentric frequency ( @xmath3 and 23.9880 mhz for the 2002 and 2003 outbursts , respectively ) , generating a pulse profile for each observation .",
    "phase offsets to the constant frequency model were then generated by cross - correlating the 2 - 60 kev pulse profiles from each observation with the template profile from 1996 july 4 used in @xcite .",
    "these pulse phase measurements were combined with frequency measurements from _",
    "exosat  _ and phase measurements from batse and _ rxte  _ described in @xcite . as done in @xcite , we fitted the all of the data with a global orbit plus a third - order polynomial intrinsic pulse frequency model for the _ exosat  _ -observed frequencies and a different quadratic pulse phase model for each outburst in the batse or _ rxte  _ data , extending the fit of @xcite by 2 additional _",
    "rxte  _ outbursts and extending the baseline spanned by observations to 18 years .",
    "the best fit orbital parameters : @xmath4 d , @xmath5 , @xmath6 lt - s , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , were consistent with those derived by @xcite . within the 2003 outburst ,",
    "our model suggests at a 2 @xmath10 level that spin - up is present , with an estimated spin - up rate of @xmath11 hz s@xmath12 .",
    "infrared photometry in the jhk bands was obtained as part of a monitoring program of be / x - ray binaries at the 1.5 m. carlos snchez telescope ( tcs ) , located at the teide observatory in tenerife , spain .",
    "the instruments used were the continuously variable filter photometer ( cvf ) up to october 1999 , and the cain - ii camera , equipped with a @xmath13 hgcdte ( nicmos 3 ) detector ever since .",
    "instrumental cvf and cain - ii values were transformed respectively to the standard systems defined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the standard jhk values is 0.01 magnitudes ( cvf ) and 0.03 magnitudes ( cain - ii ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq ] shows the best fit exo 2030 + 375 spin frequencies extracted for each batse and _ rxte  _ outburst from our model . between the last outburst detected with batse in 2000 april and the _ rxte  _ pca observed outburst in 2002 june , the average global spin - down rate was @xmath14 hz s@xmath12 .",
    "this is less than half the average spin - down rate observed by @xcite with batse , suggesting that the rate of spin - down had slowed by 2002 .    from figure",
    "[ fig : freq ] , one can clearly see that between 2002 june and 2003 september , the global trend in exo 2030 + 375 changed to spin - up with an average rate of @xmath15 hz s@xmath12 .",
    "this rate was about 40% of the average global spin - up rate observed from 1992 february to 1993",
    "november with batse @xcite , suggesting that exo 2030 + 375 likely spent some of the interval between the two _",
    "rxte  _ observations in a roughly constant spin frequency state similar to that observed with batse in 1991 through early 1992 .",
    "this possibility is intriguing and suggests that exo 2030 + 375 may be repeating the pattern of constant spin , followed by spin - up , followed by spin - down observed with batse . to further check this",
    ", we compared average spin - up rates between batse outbursts spaced by about 460 days , the interval between the _ rxte  _ observations .",
    "the average spin - up rate between the 1992 august and 1991 may outbursts was @xmath16 hz s@xmath12  and",
    "@xmath17 hz s@xmath12between the 1992 september - october and 1991 june - july outbursts , quite similar to what we observed with _",
    "rxte_. if the pattern is indeed repeating then it appears to have a period of about 11 years .",
    "as the pulsar spun - up in the batse era , the peak pulsed flux of the outbursts increased , a trend which appears to be recurring in the _ rxte  _ data .",
    "figure  [ fig : pflux ] shows the peak pulsed flux measured with batse and/or the _ rxte  _ pca for each outburst computed as described in @xcite . comparing the peak 2 - 60 kev pulsed fluxes",
    "measured with the _ rxte  _ pca in figure  [ fig : pflux ] ( filled squares ) indicates that the pulsed flux has clearly increased in the 2003 observation and is the brightest observed with _",
    "rxte  _ to date .",
    "the batse and _ rxte  _ pulsed fluxes can not easily be directly compared since they are from different energy ranges and are computed using different methods .",
    "figure  [ fig : asm ] shows 4-day average 2 - 10 kev total flux measured with the _ rxte  _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) from 1996 january to 2004 december . from 1996 through late 2001 , the outbursts were very faint . in",
    "early to mid 2002 , the outbursts began to brighten and have continued to do so throughout 2004 .",
    "_ integral _ also detected the increasing outburst flux @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : kband ] shows the long term history of infrared k magnitudes . at approximately the same time when the outburst flux dropped dramatically in the batse data , the k - band infrared flux from the companion also dropped , indicating a decrease in density of the be star s disk @xcite .",
    "the last measurements shown in @xcite indicated that by late 1999 , the be disk had brightened , i.e. increased in density , but not yet to the level observed when exo 2030 + 375 was previously spinning - up .",
    "we had no observations from late 1999 until 2001 july when the k band magnitudes were brighter than when spin - up was observed with batse . in 2002",
    "june - july , the be disk was very bright . by 2002 november ,",
    "it had returned to the level observed during the bright batse outbursts .",
    "brightening of the x - ray outbursts as observed by the _ rxte  _ asm appeared to approximately coincide with the brightening of the be disk , indicating that the disk density had again increased . over the long term ,",
    "the be disk density appears to be driving the x - ray outburst intensity .",
    "@xcite observed a sudden shift in the orbital phase of exo 2030 + 375 s outbursts from about 6 days after periastron to about 4 days before periastron , followed by a rapid recovery to peaking about 2.5 days after periastron , interpreted by @xcite as a new stable orbital phase .",
    "however , we have continued to monitor the orbital phase of the outbursts using _ rxte  _ asm outbursts and have found that the orbital phase of the outbursts continued to gradually change . as of 2004 november , the orbital phase of the outburst peak has reached about 5 days after periastron .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbph ] shows the orbital phase of exo 2030 + 375 s outburst peaks from 1991 april-2004 november .",
    "the batse outburst peaks are taken from data included in figure  9 in @xcite . for each periastron passage",
    "rxte  _ asm data were available , we fitted a gaussian to 46.02 days of single dwell , 2 - 10 kev data , centered on the predicted periastron passage time , to determine the peak time of the outburst .",
    "based on the 2002 and 2003 outbursts we observed with the _ rxte  _ pca , the global trend for exo 2030 + 375 has reversed , changing from spin - down to spin - up . as this change was occurring , _",
    "rxte  _ asm data indicated that the outbursts were brightening and infrared data indicated that the be disk density had again increased to at or above its density when batse observed spin - up and bright outbursts .",
    "the combination of these effects and the similar average spin - up rate between early batse outbursts spaced by 460 days ( the spacing between the _ rxte  _ pca observations ) , suggests that the pattern of constant spin , followed by spin - up , followed by spin - down , observed with batse , is repeating with an approximately 11 year cycle . if this pattern continues , we predict that exo 2030 + 375 will transition to spin - down in 2005 .",
    "the pattern we observe appears to be related to the density of the be disk , but it is unclear if it is related to the density perturbation that caused the shift in outburst phase .",
    "interestingly , the 11 year period is similar to the @xmath18 year period derived by @xcite for the propagation period of a density perturbation around the be disk .",
    "however , this density perturbation was used to explain the shift in orbital phase of the outburst peaks and the peak phase has not yet returned to 6 days after periastron as was observed with batse , suggesting that this cycle may not yet be complete .",
    "evidence for quasi - periods in the h@xmath2 line profiles ( so called v / r variability ) has been seen in many be / x - ray binaries with periods ranging from a few weeks to years @xcite . this v / r variability",
    "is believed to be due to density perturbations in the be disk .",
    "other be / x - ray binaries ( e.g. , 4u 0115 + 634 ) have undergone giant outbursts with near simultaneous asymmetry in the h@xmath2 profile , indicating a perturbation at the distance of the neutron star orbit .",
    "however , exo 2030 + 375 was the first object found to exhibit a sudden shift in outburst phase of normal outbursts that was likely correlated with a density perturbation in the be disk @xcite . to date , the quasi - periods shown in be / x - ray transients are much shorter than those found in isolated be stars , whose periods range from 2 years to decades . perhaps exo 2030 + 375 is a counter - example , a be transient with a decade long quasi - period .",
