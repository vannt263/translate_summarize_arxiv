    "it is now widely accepted that the initial phase of the universe was that of the exponential expansion , called inflation @xcite .",
    "it explains the extreme flatness of the universe , and predicts a nearly scale invariant spectrum of the initial density perturbations , which is now confirmed by experimental observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "simplest realization of inflation can be made in a theory of a scalar field .",
    "however , the observed amplitude of the perturbations ( cobe normalization ) requires extremely flat potential for this field , @xmath2 for the quartic coupling constant @xcite .",
    "moreover , simplest models of inflation ( with monomial potentials ) predict large amount of tensor modes generated during inflation . for the case of quartic interaction",
    "this is already strongly disfavoured by observations .",
    "it was noticed , that non - minimal coupling to gravity relaxes the required fine - tuning of the coupling constant @xcite . here",
    "i will argue , that taking into account non - minimal interaction of the scalar field with gravity ( which is quite natural and is in fact even required by quantum corrections to the action @xcite ) allows to incorporate inflation in the standard model ( sm ) without introduction of any new particles . or ,",
    "if the new scalar inflaton is introduced , non - minimal coupling largely reduces the amount of tensor modes produced , which will be bounded by future experiments .",
    "if we write the action for the scalar field and gravity with all operators of dimension not greater then 4 with no more then two derivatives we get @xmath3 with the potential @xmath4 in the following we suppose that quadratic term is irrelevant during inflationary regime ( it is true if @xmath5 ) .",
    "the simplest way to analyse this action ( see , eg.@xcite ) is to make the conformal transformation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this transformation leads to a non - minimal kinetic term for the scalar field , which can be removed by changing to the new scalar field @xmath8 @xmath9 finally , the action ( called the einstein frame action , opposed to the original jordan frame action @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is calculated using the metric @xmath13 and the potential is rescaled with the conformal factor @xmath14 already here one can hope that the situation is better , than without the non - minimal coupling : for large field values @xmath15 , and the einstein frame potential @xmath16 becomes flat .    in the following two sections",
    "i will describe two cases , corresponding to large and small non - minimal coupling @xmath17 .",
    "the case of large non - minimal coupling @xmath17 is particularly simple @xcite .",
    "we have the following change of variables @xmath18 and the potential @xmath19    thus , at large @xmath8 the potential is exponentially flat for _ any _ value of the self coupling @xmath20 .",
    "the ratio @xmath21 defines the energy density at high fields now , and thus it is possible to satisfy the cobe normalization for any @xmath20 by choosing sufficiently large value of @xmath17 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio are independent of the coupling constants in the limit of large @xmath17 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the predicted values are well within one sigma of the current wmap measurements @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wmap ] .     and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath26 with the predictions form the non - minimally coupled inflation for several @xmath17",
    ". note , that the points for @xmath27 are indistinguishable from the one with @xmath28 .",
    "right : scalar - ro - tensor ratio dependance on the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath17 . ]",
    "a very interesting candidate for the inflaton in this case is just the sm higgs field .",
    "though its self interaction is of the order of unity , sufficiently large @xmath29 , , allows it to drive inflation , and no new fields have to be added to the sm .",
    "the interesting problem here is the radiative corrections to the potential form the other fields of the sm , like the top quark and the gauge bosons .",
    "there are several ways of addressing this problem , that differ by the frame used to define he cut off energy ( or normalization point ) . in @xcite the cut off effectively corresponds to constant planck mass in the einstein frame , leading to corrections that do not spoil the flatness of the potential ( [ eq : u(chi ) ] ) , while @xcite advocates that constant plank mass cut off should be taken in the jordan frame , leading to larger corrections , but , interestingly , still allowing for successful inflation , only for rather heavy higgs mass .",
    "the proper way of taking these corrections into account is an important question open for further discussion .",
    "however , large non - minimal coupling @xmath17 is not the only possibility . as far as for zero @xmath17",
    "the amount of tensor modes predicted is too large , and it is very small for large @xmath17 , one can ask a question what is the minimal value of @xmath17 that suppresses the tensor mode generation just enough to put them into the wmap5 preferred region . to answer this question ,",
    "let us write the expressions for the spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio in the limit of small non - minimal coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "the slow roll parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xcite @xmath32 the end of the slow - roll regime ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to the field value @xmath34 @xmath35 the number of e - foldings that happened when the field changed its value from @xmath36 to @xmath34 is @xmath37    \\;.\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for small @xmath38 it reduces to @xmath39 . then it is easy to calculate the tensor - to scalar ratio @xcite @xmath40 the spectral index can be obtained as @xmath41 .",
    "the exact formulas are not hard to get by combining , , , and , but they are slightly cumbersome and not very instructive , though they were used to plot the figures .",
    "[ fig : wmap ] gives the results for several values of @xmath17 together with the wmap5 preferred region @xcite .",
    "on can see , that for @xmath42 and @xmath43 the predictions enters the @xmath44 and @xmath45 contours , respectively . the quartic coupling constant @xmath20 should still be extremely small for these values to satisfy the cobe normalization @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lxi ] .     on the non - minimal coupling parameter @xmath17 , deduced from requirement of the correct normalization of the density perturbations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "one can even argue , that for `` natural '' value for the non - minimal coupling constant of the order of @xmath47 , the amount of tensor perturbations generated is extremely small , so it is natural _ not _ to expect the large tensor modes form the inflation , contrary to the usual conclusion for large single field inflation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the non - minimal coupling of the scalar field to gravity loosens the bounds on the field self - coupling constant required for successful inflation , and reduces the amount of tensor modes produced .",
    "large non - minimal coupling ( of the order of @xmath48 ) allows to use the sm model higgs field for inflation . at the same time",
    "even very small coupling @xmath1 makes inflaton with quartic potential compatible with the cmb observations . for the coupling constant @xmath49 very small amount of tensor modes",
    "is expected for the quartic inflation .",
    "interestingly , that at the same time the non - minimally coupled inflation with quadratic potential and @xmath49 is no longer compatible with observations , generating too small spectral index , or even leading potential with runaway behaviour ( see @xcite ) .    as a summary , adding non - minimal coupling constant changes the usual expectations from inflation a lot , and lead to interesting predictions .",
    "one interesting application to the inflation in the @xmath50msm model was made in @xcite .",
