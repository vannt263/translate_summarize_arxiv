    "in recent years arrays of quantum dots have received an increasing amount of interest . with the progress of fabrication techniques quantum dot arrays are coming within the reach of experimental investigation @xcite .",
    "if the electron levels in the individual dots are aligned we encounter here a situation of resonant tunneling . in this regime ,",
    "the transport in the array becomes sensitive to precise matching of the electron levels in the dots that can be controlled by external gates .",
    "this opens up new possibilities to control the transport and perform sensitive measurements even in the simplest case of two dots @xcite .",
    "resonant tunneling in arrays of quantum dots and layered semiconductor heterostructures exhibit some similarities .",
    "the latter situation has been intensively studied in the context of possible bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "however , coulomb blockade dominates the properties of the arrays of quantum dots so that electron - electron interaction can not be neglected as in the case of layered heterostructures @xcite , @xcite . a way to circumvent this difficulty is to perform an exact diagonalization of electron states in the array  of coupled dots .",
    "then one considers independent tunneling transitions between the resulting many - electron states @xcite .",
    "this we call the independent channel approximation",
    ". this is approximate because it disregards the simultaneous tunneling an electron through multiple conduction channels .",
    "another approach is to restrict the basis to the resonant states of the uncoupled dots .",
    "then the tunneling between the dots and the reservoirs is incorporated into a modified liouville equation for the density matrix in this basis . for two quantum dots",
    "this has been done in@xcite and here we extend this approach to the case of an array of an arbitrary number of dots .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on an array of quantum dots where dots are connected in series and a tunnel coupling exists only between neighboring dots .",
    "this is the most interesting case because there is a unique path for the current and changes in any dot strongly affect the transport through the whole array .",
    "the first and last dot of the array are connected to leads .",
    "we assume that the voltage bias is sufficiently high so that the energy change during the tunneling of an electron between a reservoir and the array is much larger than the energy uncertainty due to this tunneling .",
    "we also assume that the resonant electronic energies in the array lie well between the fermi levels of the leads .",
    "this enables us to use the density matrix approach .",
    "we consider two limiting cases of the electron - electron interaction within the array . in the first case",
    "we assume that the long range coulomb repulsion between electrons in different dots of the array is so strong so that only one or no extra electrons are present in the array ( coulomb blockade ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of `` free '' electrons .",
    "as we explain below ( section [ sec : arrays ] ) we do not disregard interactions completely in the latter case but rather account only for strong repulsion within each dot .    using the density matrix approach in the basis of localized states",
    "we have obtained analytical results for the stationary current .",
    "our results hold for arbitrary values of the parameters ( within the applicability of our model ) characterizing the array like dot energies and tunnel couplings : no assumption about homogeneity of the array has been made .",
    "this may facilitate the comparison with experiments and the design of resonant tunneling devices .",
    "we report the effects of localization and coulomb repulsion on the resonant current when the energy level of the first and the last dot are independently varied .",
    "we have also considered another picture of the transport using the approximation of independent conduction channels in the array of dots . using the density matrix approach in the basis of delocalized states",
    "we have calculated the occupations of the channels and their contributions to the current .",
    "we discuss in detail the range of validity of this approximation . in the limit of both weak _ and _ strong coupling to one or both of the leads we obtain results in agreement with the former more general calculations .",
    "however , there can be substantial deviations from the predictions of this model when the tunnel rates and the coherent interdot couplings are comparable . to illustrate this we study the dependence of the current on the transparencies of the tunnel barriers and find unusual features due to the interference of electrons during tunneling .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : arrays ] we introduce the density matrix description of a multidot system coupled to leads which we apply to the coulomb blockade case in section [ sec : cb ] and to the `` free '' electron case  in section [ sec : f ] . in section",
    "[ sec : appr ] we compare the results with those obtained from the independent channel approximation and we discuss the deviations .",
    "we formulate our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",

    "the one state is related to the other by the addition of an _ extra _ electron costing an addition energy which includes intradot charging i.e. the coulomb interactions between electrons in the dot .",

    "the discussion is completely analogous to the case of strong coupling of dot @xmath0 to the right lead and the result is obtained by simply interchanging @xmath217 and @xmath218 ..      the competition between enhanced tunneling for weak coupling to the leads and destructive interference in the opposite limit implies that the current reaches a _ maximum _",

    "starting from zero the current initially increases linearly as expected from the enhanced tunneling to the right lead .",

    "( for this case the @xmath67 dependence of the resonant current peak has been discussed for a double dot system in @xcite ) . in the coulomb blockade case",
    "the non - monotonic variation of the current with @xmath221 persists for all @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum occurs at a slightly higher value of @xmath67 than for the `` free '' electron case : at @xmath225 the effective tunneling time for weak coupling is still larger than for strong coupling because the fraction of channels excluded by coulomb repulsion is larger for @xmath0 dots then for @xmath192 dots .",
    "the tunnel rate must be increased by a factor @xmath226 to exactly balance the effective tunneling times . for large @xmath0",

    "the maximum current is @xmath228 as discussed in section [ sec : strong ] there is no such effect in the coulomb blockade case : due to interdot repulsion the resonant current peak ( [ eq : imaxcbmax ] ) will increase with @xmath66 and saturate at a maximal value when @xmath229@xmath230 for @xmath94 the maximal current as a function of the rates is larger in the coulomb blockade case whereas for @xmath231 it is larger in the `` free '' electron case .",
    "we have extended the density matrix approach to resonant tunneling to the case of a linear array of quantum dots with strong , long range electron - electron interaction .",
