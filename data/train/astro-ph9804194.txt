    "astronomers have been searching for direct evidence for the presence of black holes ( bhs ) in galactic nuclei for more than two decades .",
    "initially , the only constraints on the central mass distributions of galaxies were obtained from ground - based stellar kinematical observations .",
    "more recently , the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the subsequent refurbishment in 1993 have provided an important increase in spatial resolution .",
    "combined with new techniques for data analysis and dynamical modeling this has strengthened the stellar kinematical evidence for bhs in several quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy et al .  1996a , b ; van der marel et al .",
    "1997a ; cretton & van den bosch 1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "new tools for the detection of bhs were also developed .",
    "hst observations of the rotation velocities of nuclear disks of ionized gas provided accurate bh mass determinations for several active galaxies ( e.g. , harms et al .",

    "1997 ; bower et al .",
    "1998 ) , while for other galaxies bhs were detected through vlbi observations of nuclear water maser sources ( e.g. , miyoshi et al .  1995 ) .",
    "the case for a bh in our own galaxy improved drastically through measurements of stellar proper motions exceeding @xmath18 in the central @xmath19 ( genzel et al .",
    "there are now a total of 1020 galaxies for which a nuclear dark mass , most likely a bh , has been convincingly detected .",

    "our understanding remains sketchy , but is consistent with a picture in which a majority of galaxies has bhs , and in which the bh mass @xmath20 correlates with the luminosity or mass of the host spheroid .",
    "in this paper we present and analyze hst data for the e4 galaxy ngc 7052 .",
    "this galaxy is a radio source with a core and jet , but no lobes ( morganti et al .  1987 ) .",
    "ground - based optical images show a nuclear dust disk aligned with the major axis of the galaxy ( nieto et al .",
    "the physical properties of this disk were discussed by de juan , colina & golombek ( 1996 ) . in a previous paper ( van den bosch & van der marel 1995 ; hereafter paper  i ) we presented ground - based narrow - band imaging and long - slit spectroscopy obtained with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "these observations showed that there is also a rotating nuclear disk of ionized gas in ngc 7052 .",
    "the gas has a steep central rotation curve , rising to nearly @xmath21 at @xmath22 from the center .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of the spectra was insufficient to convincingly detect a bh , due in part to the relatively large distance of ngc 7052 ( @xmath23 ; i.e. , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas was found to increase from @xmath7 at @xmath22 from the center to @xmath25 on the nucleus .",
    "we showed that this can not be the sole result of rotational broadening , which would have predicted double - peaked line profile shapes that are not observed .",
    "instead , the observed central increase in the line width must be at least partly intrinsic .",
    "the ground - based kinematics yield an upper limit of @xmath26 on the mass of any possible bh .    to improve the constraints on the presence of a central bh we obtained broad- and narrow - band images of ngc 7052 with the second wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) and spectroscopy with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , both in the context of hst project go-5848 .",
    "we discuss the imaging and photometric analysis in section  [ s : wf ] , and the spectroscopy and kinematical analysis in section  [ s : fos ] . in section  [ s : dyn ]",
    "we construct dynamical models to interpret the results . with the high spatial resolution of these data we are able to better constrain the nuclear mass distribution , and we find that ngc 7052 has a bh with mass @xmath27 .",
    "we summarize and discuss our findings in section  [ s : disc ] .",
    "some observational details are presented in an appendix .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 throughout this paper .",
    "this does not directly influence the data - model comparison for any of our models , but does set the length , mass and luminosity scales of the models in physical units .",
    "specifically , distances , lengths and masses scale as @xmath29 , while mass - to - light ratios scale as @xmath30 .",
    "we used the wfpc2 to obtain both broad- and narrow - band images of ngc 7052 .",
    "the wfpc2 is described in detail by , e.g. , biretta et al .",

    "this filter has a transmission curve with a fwhm of @xmath32% of the central wavelength . by placing the target at a known position on the detector ,",
    "we obtained images of the nuclear region around @xmath33 ( ` on - band ' ; covering h@xmath3+[nii ] ) and @xmath34 ( ` off - band ' ) .",
    "the wfpc2 has four chips , each with @xmath35 pixels .",
    "the @xmath0 and  @xmath2 images were taken with the galaxy centered on the pc chip , yielding a pixel size of @xmath36 . the @xmath1 and lrf images were taken with the galaxy centered on one of the wf chips , yielding a pixel size of @xmath37 .",
    "the images were calibrated by the hst calibration ` pipeline ' maintained by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) .",
    "the standard reduction steps include bias subtraction , dark current subtraction and flat - fielding , as described in detail by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "the pipeline does not flat - field lrf images , so we manually flat - fielded those using the flat - field for a broad - band filter with a comparable central wavelength ( f675w ) .",
    "three different exposures were taken with each filter , each with the target shifted by a small integer number of pixels .",
    "the different exposures for each filter were aligned , and then combined with simultaneous removal of cosmic rays and chip defects .",
    "this yields one final image per filter .",
    "the final images were corrected for the geometric distortion of the wfpc2 , and constant backgrounds were subtracted , as measured at those regions of the detector where the galactic contribution is negligible .    to obtain an image of the h@xmath3+[nii ] emission one must subtract an off - band image from the on - band image .",
    "one option is to use the @xmath1 or @xmath2-band image ( or an appropriate combination ) as off - band image .",
    "these images have the advantage of high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , the central wavelengths differ significantly from that of h@xmath3+[nii ] , so the dust absorption in these images may not be the same as in the on - band image .",
    "such differential dust absorption may be incorrectly interpreted as gas emission . to minimize differential dust absorption",
    ", we instead used the @xmath34 lrf image as off - band image .",
    "this off - band image was aligned with the on - band image , scaled to fit the on - band image at radii where the ionized gas flux is negligible , and subtracted from the on - band image .",

    "( 1995b ) .",
    "the count - rates in the lrf images were calibrated to erg @xmath39 s@xmath40 using calculations with the synphot package in iraf .",

    "( 1996 ) and the spectral energy distribution around h@xmath3+[nii ] measured in paper i. the flux calibration of the h@xmath3+[nii ] image was verified by comparing it to the results of our hst / fos spectroscopy .",
    "figure  [ f : images ] shows the reduced images , with from top - left to bottom - right , the @xmath2-band image , the @xmath0-band image , the @xmath41 image and the emission line image of h@xmath3+[nii ] .",
    "the most prominent feature in the broad - band images is the absorption by the dust disk .",
    "the morphology of the starlight in the central region resembles that of a cone emanating from the nucleus .",
    "since no such structure is seen in the emission line image , we exclude the possibility that the cone is related to an ionization cone .",
    "rather , the cone may indicate that the dust disk has a non - zero opening angle ( such that its thickness increases with distance ) .",
    "however , without detailed modeling it is not possible to rule out alternative morphologies for the dust disk , such as a constant scale - height or ring morphology .",
    "the @xmath41 image shows the dust absorption more directly .",
    "the galaxy is reddest at the front edge of the disk ( @xmath42 ) , because this is where the fraction of the starlight along the line of sight that is ` eclipsed ' by the disk is largest .",
    "the dust lane is also visible in the h@xmath3+[nii ] image , but less prominently than in the broad - band images .",
    "we have fitted by eye the outline of the dust disk in the @xmath41 image and the outline of the gas disk in the h@xmath3+[nii ] image . both are well approximated by an ellipse , although the ionized gas has some additional filamentary extensions to the north and west .",
    "the fitted ellipses have a semi - major by semi - minor axis size of @xmath43 for the dust disk , and @xmath44 for the gas disk .",
    "the disks have very similar size , probably indicating a common origin .",
    "the inferred axial ratio is @xmath45 for both components , where the error was estimated by eye . if we make the simplifying assumptions that both the dust and gas disks are circular , have negligible thickness , and reside in the equatorial plane , then the implied inclination is @xmath46",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the results of the models presented in paper i , which indicated @xmath47 .    the centroid of the stellar isophotes at large radii coincides with the observed peak surface brightness in the broad - band images to within the errors of @xmath48",
    "this , combined with the point - like appearance of the ` nucleus ' in the broad - band images , suggests that we may be seeing the center of the stellar distribution through the dust .",
    "in contrast with the case for ngc 4261 ( ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ) , we have found no evidence ( to within the errors of @xmath49 ) that either the dust disk or the gas disk is offset from the galaxy center defined by the starlight .",
    "the principal axes of the stellar , gaseous and dust components are also well aligned .",
    "none of the components is aligned with the position angle of the radio jet in ngc 7052 ( morganti et al .",
    "1987 ) , as indicated in figure  [ f : images ] .",
    "this has been found to be the case in more galaxies with nuclear gas disks ( de juan , colina & golombek 1996 ) , although in other galaxies the alignment with the radio axis has been found to be quite good ( e.g. , ngc 4261 and m87 ; ford et al .",
    "1994 ; ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath41 image shows two regions near the nucleus , labeled a and  b , that are bluer ( @xmath50@xmath51 ) than most of the dust obscured region ( which has @xmath52@xmath53 ) and also than the main body of the galaxy",
    ". the blue color of these regions may be due to local star formation or to a contribution of [ oiii]5007 emission to the @xmath0-band image ( although no enhanced h@xmath3+[nii ] emission is seen at these positions ) .",
    "the region  b is approximately aligned with the radio jet of ngc 7052 , and could also be non - thermal optical emission from a jet knot . however , even the best available radio image of the jet ( morganti et al .",
    "1987 ) has a resolution of more than @xmath54 arcsec , so it is unknown whether there is a radio knot at the position of the region  b. our ignorance of the exact nature of the regions  a and  b has no impact on our study of the nuclear mass distribution of ngc 7052 .",
    "the stellar surface brightness outside the dust distribution is best analyzed by fitting ellipses to the isophotes .",
    "we have done this with the software in the iraf package stsdas , which is based on the algorithm of jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : ellipsefit ] shows the @xmath2-band surface brightness , the @xmath55 and @xmath56 colors , the ellipticity ( @xmath57 ) , the major axis position angle ( @xmath58 ) and the amplitudes of the third and fourth order fourier coefficients of the isophotes ( describing deviations from pure ellipses ) , all as functions of radius along the major axis .",
    "results are not shown for @xmath59 , where dust absorption dominates the observed morphology .",
    "the isophotal structure of ngc  7052 outside the dust disk is very regular .",
    "the third and fourth order fourier coefficients are consistent with zero , indicating that the isophotes are accurately elliptical .",
    "no significant isophote twist is present .",

    "we assume that @xmath65 is oblate axisymmetric , that the isoluminosity spheroids have constant flattening @xmath66 as a function of radius , and that @xmath65 can be parameterized as @xmath67^{-\\beta } , \\quad    m^2 \\equiv r^2 + z^2 q^{-2 } .",

    "we neglect the slight increase in the observed ellipticity with radius .",
    "the minor axis @xmath2-band profile does not strongly constrain the central cusp slope @xmath3 , because of the dust absorption at small radii .",

    "for any fixed @xmath3 , the remaining model parameters are determined by @xmath77 minimization to best fit the minor axis @xmath2-band profile outside the region influenced by dust ( between @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) . in the data - model comparison we use the projected surface brightness profile predicted by equation  ( [ lumdendef ] ) , convolved with the wfpc2 point - spread - function ( psf ) and pixel size .",
    "the psf convolution is important because the psf wings extend to several arcseconds , despite the fact that the fwhm is only @xmath12 .",

    "the bottom panel shows the residuals for each fit , which must be attributed to dust absorption .",
    "models with larger values of @xmath3 have more dust absorption , and therefore predict more reddening of the starlight .",
    "so to further constrain the models , and in particular @xmath3 , we consider the observed @xmath41 color .",
    "figure  [ f : minorcolor ] shows @xmath41 as function of minor axis distance , again averaged over a @xmath63 wide strip centered on the nucleus . outside the central arcsec",
    "there is a smooth color gradient , seen also in figure  [ f : ellipsefit ] .",
    "the colors and color gradients of ngc 7052 have values typical of elliptical galaxies .",
    "color gradients such as seen in ngc 7052 are believed to be due to stellar population gradients ( e.g. , kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) .",
    "extrapolation of the outer @xmath41 gradient in ngc 7052 into the center emphasizes the additional reddening due to dust absorption .",
    "the @xmath41 is largest at negative radii ( downward in figure  [ f : images ] ) , which are at the front side of the dust disk .",
    "the reddening at positive radii is more modest .",
    "the nucleus itself is slightly bluer than its surroundings ( see also figure  [ f : images ] ) .",
    "this may be an artifact due to differences in the psfs for the @xmath0 and the @xmath2-band images , but it may also indicate a contribution of a nuclear non - thermal continuum or the presence of a central hole in the dust distribution .    to model the observed reddening we assume that the dust resides in the equatorial plane .",
    "let the @xmath83-axis be oriented such that the observer sees the region @xmath84 in front of the dust disk , and let the @xmath85-axis be along the line - of - sight .",

    "we then assume the stellar population gradient in @xmath41 to be given by the linear fit in figure  [ f : minorcolor ] .",

    "also , the comparison is limited to only one side of the dust disk ( the right half in figure  [ f : images ] ; this excludes the regions a and b which may be contaminated by [ oiii ] emission ) .",

    "rotation velocity and velocity dispersion measurements were both included in the fit , yielding a total of 44 data points .",
    "the wht data show some features that are in contradiction with the assumption of perfect axisymmetry : the velocity dispersion profiles along both the major and minor axes are not quite symmetric , and there is a small amount of rotation along the minor axis .",
    "this implies that the models can never fit the wht measurements to within their formal errors , which are significantly smaller than those for the fos data ( a result of higher @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , the models will automatically search for the best fit to the average of the measurements at positive and negative radii .",
    "we do not believe that this compromises our ability to infer the nuclear mass distribution of ngc 7052 with axisymmetric models .",
    "however , one complication is the weighting of data with its formal errors in the usual definition of @xmath77 .",
    "this causes the minimization routine to assign disproportionate priority to features in the wht data that it can never fit , while neglecting the fit to the fos data .",
    "this is not desirable , because the fos data have higher spatial resolution , and therefore contain more information on the mass distribution at small radii . to ensure that the fos and wht data receive roughly equal weight in the fitting process , we artificially assigned all wht data points an error of @xmath181 in the definition of @xmath77 , equal to the median error for the hst data points .",
    "although somewhat artificial , we have found that this works well in practice .",
    "it does mean that the resulting @xmath77 can not be used for the calculation of confidence intervals on the best - fitting model parameters .",
    "we realize this , and therefore calculate in section  [ ss : mbhrange ] confidence intervals on @xmath20 on the basis of a statistic that only uses the fos observations ( for which the errors were taken as observed ) .",
    "the curves in figure  [ f : modelfits ] show the predictions of the model that provides the overall best fit to the data .",
    "its parameters are : @xmath182 , @xmath183 ( in @xmath2-band solar units ) , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "this model adequately reproduces all the important features of the kinematical data , including the rotation curve slope and the nuclear velocity dispersion inferred from the hst data .",
    "the fit of our flux distribution model ( equation  [ [ fluxparam ] ] ) to the observed fluxes ( top panel of figure  [ f : modelfits ] ) was discussed already in section  [ ss : wfgas ] .",
    "the circular velocity curve @xmath165 of a model with a bh has a minimum that is non - zero ( for our best - fit model the minimum of @xmath167 is @xmath187 ) .",
    "intrinsically , no gas moves slower than this , although gas for which only a fraction of the orbital velocity is observed along the line of sight may be observed at lower velocities .",
    "hence , there is a tendency for models with a bh to predict double - peaked line profiles for observations on the nucleus , with the peaks at @xmath188_{\\rm min } \\sin i$ ] , corresponding to gas seen moving towards and away from the observer on either side of the nucleus .",
    "however , a significant intrinsic dispersion for the gas will tend to ` wash away ' the peaks .",
    "our best - fit model has both a bh and a significant intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study whether its predicted line shapes are comparable to the observed ones .",
    "figure  [ f : lineshapes]b compares the predicted spectrum to the data for fos observation # 4 ( see table  [ t : spectra ] ) , which was obtained on the nucleus .",
    "the model does not predict double - peaked or flat - topped line profiles , but instead predicts profiles with a narrow core and broad wings , as seen in the observations .",
    "the predictions are acceptable , and fit better than gaussian profiles ( shown in figure  [ f : lineshapes]a for comparison ) .",
    "similar results were obtained for the other fos observations .",
    "the fits to the line shapes could conceivably be improved further by allowing the intrinsic velocity distribution in the disk at any given position to be non - gaussian , but this is not something that we have explored .",
    "it is already clear that our best - fit model is consistent with the observed line shapes .    the observed velocity dispersion of the gas increases from @xmath189 at @xmath22 from the nucleus , to @xmath190 as seen through the @xmath4 diameter fos aperture on the nucleus . in principle",
    ", one can get an increase in the observed velocity dispersion towards the nucleus even if there is no intrinsic gradient , through the effect of rotational broadening around a central bh .",
    "however , it was shown already in paper  i that a model with a bh and no intrinsic velocity dispersion gradient is unacceptable : such a model predicts double - peaked emission line shapes that are in contradiction with observations .",
    "we similarly find that such models fail to fit the hst data .",
    "hence , the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the gas in ngc 7052 must increase towards the nucleus .",
    "our best - fit model has a turbulent velocity dispersion that increases to values in excess of @xmath191 in the central @xmath12 .",
    "we argue in section  [ ss : starkin ] that this is not in contradiction with the assumption of bulk circular motion for the gas .",
    "thus , the ionized gas in ngc 7052 has both a sharply increasing flux and a sharply increasing velocity dispersion towards the nucleus .",
    "it may be that this signifies the presence of a ( partly unresolved ) narrow - line region .",
    "there is no evidence for a broad - line region , because the increasing line width is not restricted to h@xmath3 , but is seen in the forbidden [ nii ] lines as  well .      to determine the range of bh masses that provides a statistically acceptable fit to the data , we compare the predictions of models with different , fixed values of @xmath20 , but in which the remaining parameters are varied to optimize the fit .",
    "the radial dependence of the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the gas is essentially a free function in our models , so the observed velocity dispersion measurements can be fit equally well for all plausible values of @xmath20 .",
    "the observed ground - based rotation measurements can also be fit equally well for all plausible @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath192 ; cf .",
    "paper  i ) , because for all such values the radius of the bh sphere of influence is smaller than the ground - based spatial resolution .",

    "the parameters @xmath164 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are fixed almost entirely by the ground - based data and the hst velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "these parameters can therefore not be varied independently to improve the fit to the hst rotation velocity measurements . as a result",
    ", @xmath198 follows approximately a @xmath77 probability distribution with @xmath199 degrees of freedom ( there are six hst measurements , and there is one free parameter : @xmath20 ) .",

    "the results for these galaxies therefore show that any relation between @xmath20 and @xmath230 must have a scatter of at least a factor @xmath16 , even if the comparison is restricted to galaxies of similar type .",

    "in the first fos visit ( september 1995 ) the instrument was commanded to obtain spectra on the nucleus and at @xmath238 along the major axis , and in the second visit ( august 1996 ) on the nucleus and at @xmath239 along the major axis . to determine the actual aperture positions during the observations we make the simplifying assumption that the relative positions of the apertures during each visit were as intended , but that for each visit there is one absolute offset ( corresponding to the difference between the actual position of the galaxy center and the telescope s estimate of the galaxy center ) .",
    "this assumption is justified if there is little telescope drift during the observations ( telescope drifts during a visit are usually small , @xmath240 , although larger drifts can sometimes occur ; e.g. , van der marel et al .",
    "we have determined the absolute offset for each visit using three different methods , based on : ( i ) the target acquisition data ; ( ii ) the ratios of either the continuum or the emission - line intensity between observations at different positions ; and ( iii ) the fos image obtained at the end of each visit .    the final target acquisition stage on the peak - up star placed the 0.3 aperture at a @xmath241 grid on the sky with inter - point spacings of @xmath242 .",
    "the intensity at each position was measured , and the grid point with the highest intensity was adopted by the telescope as its estimate of the position of the star .",
    "the intensities for all 25 positions were returned to the ground , and could be interpolated _ post hoc _ to determine the actual position of the star , which is not generally exactly at a grid point .",
    "this yields a direct estimate of the absolute positional offset for each visit , under the assumption that target acquisition inaccuracies provide the dominant source of positional error .",
    "each galaxy spectrum yields the total intensity in the h@xmath3+[nii ] lines and in the surrounding continuum .",
    "we binned the intensities observed in the wfpc2 on - band and off - band images in @xmath4 circular apertures , and determined the absolute positional offset that best reproduces the intensities observed in the spectra .",
    "this yields a second estimate of the absolute positional offset for each visit , but only for the component along the major axis ( both the intensity distribution and the positioning of the apertures are aligned along the major axis , so any positional offset in the direction parallel to the minor axis yields little change in the predicted intensity ratios ) .",
    "the fos image obtained at the end of each visit provides a third estimate of the absolute positional offset .",
    "the telescope was commanded to position the 4.3 aperture ( a square aperture of @xmath243 ) at its estimate of the galaxy center , and to record an image by stepping the diode array of the instrument along the aperture .",
    "this yields an image with @xmath244 pixels , with a point - spread - function equal to the size of one diode ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "we modeled the image for each visit by masking the wfpc2 @xmath2-band image with the aperture size , convolving it with the boxcar psf of one diode , and determining the absolute positional offset that provides the best fit in a @xmath77 sense to the observed fos image .    for each visit , the three different methods for determining the absolute positional offset yield results that are mutually consistent to within @xmath246 in each coordinate . for the first spectroscopic visit we find @xmath247 , and for the second visit @xmath248 , where @xmath149 is the coordinate system used in section  [ ss : fosobsetup ] .",
