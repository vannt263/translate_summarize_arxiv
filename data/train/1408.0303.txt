    "numerous phenomena in nature  such as human waves in stadiums @xcite and flocks of seagulls @xcite  result from the interaction of many individual elements , and they can exhibit fascinating emergent dynamics that can not arise in individual or even small numbers of components @xcite . in practice , however , a key assumption in most such studies is that each component is described by the same dynamical system .",
    "however , systems with heterogeneous elements are much more common than homogeneous systems .",
    "for example , a set of interacting cars on a highway that treats all cars as the same ignores different types of cars ( e.g. , their manufacturer , their age , different levels of intoxication among the drivers , etc . ) , and a dynamical system that governs the behavior of different cars could include different parameter values or even different functional forms entirely for different cars . additionally , one needs to use different functional forms to address phenomena such as interactions among cars , traffic lights , and police officers . unfortunately , because little is known about heterogeneous interacting systems @xcite , the assumption of homogeneity is an important simplification that allows scholars to apply a plethora of analytical tools . nevertheless , it is important to depart from the usual assumption of homogeneity and examine coupled dynamical systems with heterogeneous components .",
    "the study of coupled map lattices ( cmls ) @xcite is one important way to study the emergent phenomena ( e.g. , cooperation , synchronization , and more ) that can occur in interacting systems .",
    "cmls have been used to model systems in numerous fields that range from physics and chemistry to sociology , economics , and computer science @xcite . in a cml ,",
    "each component is a discrete dynamical system ( i.e. , a map ) .",
    "there are a wealth of both theoretical and computational studies of homogeneous cmls @xcite , in which the interacting elements are each governed by the same map .",
    "such investigations have yielded insights on a wide variety of phenomena . as we mentioned above",
    ", the assumption of homogeneity is a major simplification that often is not justifiable .",
    "therefore , we focus on heterogeneous cmls , in which the interacting elements are governed by different maps or by the same map with different parameter values . the temporal evolution of a heterogeneous coupled map lattice ( cml ) with @xmath0 components is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the state of the entity at instant @xmath3 at position @xmath4 of a lattice and @xmath5 weights the coupling between these entities .",
    "we consider entities in the form of oscillators , where the @xmath4th oscillator evolves according to the map @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are , in general , different functions that depend on a parameter @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) .",
    "we assume that each @xmath7 is a @xmath10 unimodal function that depends continuously on the parameter @xmath8 with a critical point c at @xmath8 . as usual",

    "weakly coupled systems can exhibit phenomena ( e.g. , phase separation because of additive noise @xcite ) that do not arise in strongly coupled systems , and one can even use weak coupling along with noise to fully synchronize nonidentical oscillators @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to examine hwcmls , which are amenable to perturbative approaches . in our paper , we characterize periodic orbits both far away from and near saddle  node ( sn ) bifurcations .",
    "understanding periodic orbits is interesting by itself and is also crucial for achieving an understanding of more complicated dynamics ( such as chaos ) @xcite .",
    "we then characterize the laminar regime of type - i intermittency in our hwcmls .",

    "the parameter value @xmath17 is a bifurcation value of @xmath8 for the @xmath4th map , so @xmath18 denotes the points in a periodic orbit at this parameter value .",

    "we seek to derive results that are valid at size @xmath22 .",
    "we need to consider the following situations :    1 .   in this case , when we expand to size @xmath22 , the coupling term does not contribute at all .",
    "therefore , the oscillators in ( [ equ1 ] ) behave as if they were uncoupled at this order of the expansion .",
    "2 .   in this case",

    "we examine heterogeneous cmls in which the uncoupled oscillators have periodic orbits either far from or near sn bifurcations . as periodic orbits exhibit different dynamics from each other depending on whether they are near or",

    "a toy macroscopic traffic flow model , governed by the logistic map , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the model is based on very general assumptions involving speed and density .",
    "when these assumptions are satisfied , one can use the model to help examine the evolution of flows of pedestrians , flows in a factory , and so on .",
    "when such flows interact weakly , then equations of the form that we discussed in section [ sub : periodicorbits ] can be useful for such applications .",
    "for example , one could do a simple examination of the temporal evolution of two groups of football fans around a stadium ( or of sheep around an obstacle @xcite ) . the two groups have different properties , so suppose that they are governed by an hwcml . from our results , if each group is regularly entering the stadium on its own ( i.e. , their behavior is periodic ) , then both groups considered together would continue to enter regularly at the same rate , provided that the interaction between the two groups is weak .",

    "one can construe the intermittent traffic flow in a traffic jam as being formed by regular motions ( i.e. , a laminar regime ) and a series of acceleration and braking ( i.e. , chaotic bursts ) .",

    "<S> coupled map lattices ( cmls ) are often used to study emergent phenomena in nature . it is typically assumed ( unrealistically ) that each component is described by the same map , and it is important to relax this assumption . in this paper , we characterize periodic orbits and the laminar regime of type - i intermittency in _ heterogeneous _ weakly coupled map lattices ( hwcmls ) . we show that the period of a cycle in an hwcml is preserved for arbitrarily small coupling strengths even when an associated uncoupled oscillator would experience a period - doubling cascade . </S>",
