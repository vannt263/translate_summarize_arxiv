    "the pulsar arecibo l - band feed array ( palfa ) project is a deep pulsar survey of low galactic latitudes being conducted at the 305-m william e.  gordon telescope at the arecibo observatory @xcite .",
    "the survey s relatively high operating frequency of 1420  mhz makes it particularly sensitive to pulsars over a far larger volume of the galaxy than previous surveys , notably to those pulsars with high dispersion measures and short spin periods @xcite .",
    "the primary aims of the survey include the discovery of binary pulsars which might provide tests of strong - field gravitation theories and the determination of the neutron star equation of state @xcite , the discovery of millisecond pulsars which might be included in pulsar timing arrays in the quest for gravitational waves @xcite , and to better determine the galactic distribution of the pulsar population @xcite and the galactic interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the properties of palfa also make it an ideal instrument for discovering young pulsars in the galactic plane that may have associations with supernova remnants and other high - energy phenomena and are also likely to have notable timing properties for studying neutron star interiors .    in a previous paper ,",
    "@xcite presented timing measurements of a first tranche of 35 relatively slowly rotating pulsars discovered in the palfa survey prior to 2008 . here",
    ", we describe timing observations of a further 29 such pulsars discovered up to 2013 .",
    "these observations were made primarily with the lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory , with a few observations using the 100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope . following a brief description of the survey in  [ sec : survey ] and presentation of the observations in  [ sec :",
    "obs ] , we give the results of timing analyses of the pulsars in  [ sec : timing ] and provide their flux densities and pulse profiles in  [ sec : flux ] .",
    "we also discuss a small number of the pulse profiles which show clear evidence for interstellar multipath scattering . in ",
    "[ sec : young ] to  [ sec : glitches ] , we discuss several notable pulsars : two are young , one is in a binary system , and two display large glitches in their rotation rate .",
    "we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "details of the palfa survey are described in the following papers : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we therefore give only a synopsis here .",
    "the survey includes the regions of the galactic plane ( @xmath4 ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) that are accessible with the arecibo telescope .",
    "each pointing of the 7-beam alfa receiver had a dwell time of 268s and , for observations prior to 2009 , a bandwidth of 100 mhz was channelised and digitised using the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) 3-level autocorrelator system @xcite .",
    "the dual polarisations were summed to give 256 total - intensity channels sampled every 64  @xmath7s .",
    "subsequent observations used the wider bandwidth of 322 mhz which was channelised to 960 channels which were sampled every 65.5 @xmath7s using the mock spectrometers @xcite .",
    "of the 29 pulsars reported in this paper , 3 were discovered using the wapp spectrometers and 26 using the mock spectrometers .",
    "the large volume of data that is acquired has meant that several analysis pipelines were used to process the data and to discover the pulsars by seeking either single or periodic dispersed pulses . of the pulsars presented in this paper 13",
    "were discovered using the einstein@home pipeline @xcite , which uses spare cycles of a global network of pcs .",
    "the other 16 were discovered using either the presto - based pipeline @xcite , the `` quicklook '' pipeline , which runs at the telescope in near - real - time @xcite , or a pipeline designed to find single dispersed pulses @xcite .",
    "this paper presents some of the long - period pulsars discovered in the survey to date .",
    "however it has already resulted in the discovery of binary and millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the first - known repeating fast radio burst source @xcite .",
    "the 76-m lovell telescope at the jodrell bank observatory , united kingdom , has been used both to confirm the existence of , and to conduct follow - up timing observations of , more than half of the pulsars detected in the survey , including the 29 pulsars reported here .",
    "in addition , one pulsar ( j1925 + 1720 ) was also observed initially with the green bank telescope .",
    "while some of the pulsars we present here were discovered using the single pulse search pipeline , all of the timing solutions presented were derived using the average profiles of each entire observation .",
    "observations with the lovell telescope reported here spanned the period 2011 august and 2015 january ( mjd  55800@xmath057050 ) and made use of a cryogenically cooled dual - polarisation receiver working in the frequency range 13501700 mhz .",
    "the system equivalent flux density on cold sky is 25jy .",
    "a 512-mhz wide band was nyquist sampled at 8-bit resolution and channelised into 0.5-mhz - wide channels using a digital filterbank . to achieve a typical s / n of @xmath8 , observation durations varied from 10 to 40 minutes .",
    "for each pulsar the data were folded on to 1024 bins across the pulse period in sub - integrations of 10  s using a polynomial derived from the best ephemeris .",
    "the data were `` cleaned '' of radio - frequency interference by removing sub - integrations or channels that were adversely affected . to form the final average profile ,",
    "the dispersion delay between the frequency channels was removed using incoherent dedispersion . as the initial period and dispersion measure ( dm ) values",
    "are uncertain , improved pulsar parameters were derived from the confirmation observations by optimising for s / n in the average profile using a range of trial period and dm values . once these improved parameters were determined , subsequent analysis used times of arrival ( toas ) with initial phase connection achieved using psrtime and final timing solutions were obtained using tempo .",
    "each of the sources had an observational cadence of 1 to 4 weeks depending on telescope availability and typically a single toa was derived from any given observation .",
    "timing solutions for each pulsar were found by using tempo to fit a standard timing model to the toas using a @xmath9 minimization technique . to incorporate the toas obtained with the green bank telescope for psr j1925 + 1720 a time offset was computed between the jodrell bank and green bank toas . solar system and time transfer made use of the jpl de405 solar system ephemeris @xcite and the tt(bipm11 ) time scale respectively . in all cases",
    "the standard model included the rotation period and period derivative , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the right ascension @xmath12 and declination @xmath13 , and the dm .",
    "as discussed below , higher order frequency derivatives , binary parameters and glitch parameters were also needed to adequately model some of the pulsars .",
    "the resultant parameters and their associated 95% confidence interval uncertainties are given in table  [ table : measured ] .",
    "although some profiles do show scattering (  [ sec : profiles ] ) , no correction to the dm values for those pulsars has been made .",
    "the timing residuals corresponding to the difference between the measured toas and the times of arrival predicted by the timing models are shown in figures  [ fig : resid1 ] and [ fig : resid2 ] . in the majority of cases the residuals are `` white '' , that is they show no discernible structure .",
    "however in a few cases there is significant timing noise and higher order period derivatives were required to `` whiten '' the residuals using the method described by @xcite .",
    "this was necessary in order to measure accurate pulsar parameters .",
    "the procedure ensures that the the number of fitted derivatives @xmath14 , listed in table  [ table : measured ] , results in groups of timing residuals having no evident correlation .",
    "several quantities , the spin - down age , @xmath15 , surface magnetic field strength , @xmath16 , and spin - down energy loss rates , @xmath17 , derived from the timing parameters given in table  [ table : measured ] are presented in table  [ table : derived ] .",
    "the table also contains the galactic coordinates and the distance derived from the dm and the ne2001 model @xcite for the distribution of free electrons .",
    "the same jodrell bank timing data was used to form a long term average pulse profile and also to determine the mean flux density of all 29 pulsars ( figures  [ fig : profs_a ] and [ fig : profs_b ] ) . only observations that resulted in a good toa were used .",
    "the amplitude scale of each pulse profile was adjusted to be in units of the system noise and they were aligned using the `` whitened '' timing solutions (  [ sec : timing ] ) before being summed .",
    "the system equivalent flux density for each pulsar position was calculated from observations of standard continuum radio sources , adjusted for the local sky brightness temperatures .",
    "after appropriate scaling , the time - averaged mean flux density @xmath18 was measured for each profile and is given in table  [ table : measured ] .",
    "luminosity estimates , @xmath19 , are also calculated using the distances derived from dms using the ne2001 model @xcite and are given in table  [ table : derived ] .",
    "the observed profiles display similar forms to those of the known pulsar population and none exhibits a significant interpulse .",
    "the flux density limit for any interpulse emission depends upon the signal - to - noise ratio which varies from pulsar to pulsar and can be judged from the profiles presented in figure  [ fig : profs_a ] .",
    "this limit is typically 5% of the flux density of the main pulse given in table  [ table : derived ] , assuming that any interpulse has a similar pulse width to that of the main pulse .",
    "the widths of the pulse profiles at half the peak height @xmath20 in milliseconds are presented in table  [ table : measured ] and are also typical of the pulsar population .",
    "the relatively high dm values for these pulsars suggests that some of them may show evidence of an asymmetric broadening of the pulse profile with a strong frequency dependence that would be indicative of scattering by the turbulent interstellar medium .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : scatter ] this is clearly the case for psrs j1851 + 0233 , j1859 + 0603 , j1900 + 0438 and j1901 + 0459 . to quantify the degree of scattering",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite , who model the pulse profile as a single gaussian component convolved with a one - sided exponential that has a @xmath21 broadening time with a frequency dependence given by @xmath22 .",
    "the amplitude of the gaussian component is allowed to vary as a function of frequency but the position and width is held fixed . to allow for the fact that the dm used to generate the profiles to be fitted",
    "may be biased due to distortions of the pulse shape by the scattering , the model also includes a @xmath23 dm fit parameter to account for this .",
    "this model fitted the observed pulse shapes satisfactorily for all four pulsars .",
    "the measured scattering timescales for psrs j1851 + 0233 , j1859 + 0603 , j1900 + 0438 , and j1901 + 0459 in the two bands were found to scale with observing frequency approximately as @xmath24 , confirming the presence of interstellar multipath scattering .",
    "the pulse profiles for the four pulsars and their fitted models are shown in figure  [ fig : scatter ] .",
    "the scattering time scales @xmath25 were determined with precision of order ten percent and had values of 0.08(1 ) , 0.09(1 ) , 0.29(3 ) and 0.12(2 )  s , respectively .",
    "although this model fits the observed pulse profiles well , we note that it is possible that the intrinsic pulse profiles are more complex than the assumed gaussian form , and this may have an unrecognised influence on the measured values .",
    "in addition , psrs  j1857 + 0300 , j1901 + 0234 , and j1903 + 0654 show some evidence of the expected frequency scaling for scattering , although determination of the amount of scattering was not possible due to the low signal - to - noise ratio and/or complex profile morphology .",
    "the profiles of the remaining pulsars show no significant scatter broadening .",
    "as noted above the broadening of the pulse profile can cause the pulses to be delayed by a frequency - dependent amount which results in an overestimate of the dm measured simply by optimising s / n . such an effect is present even if the pulse - broadening is indiscernable .",
    "while deconvolution of the pulses is possible to allow a truer determination of the dm , we have not done so for any of the pulsars presented in table  [ table : measured ] .",
    "psrs j1907 + 0631 and j1925 + 1720 have the smallest characteristic ages of the 29 pulsars presented , being around 10  kyr and 100  kyr respectively . further evidence of the youth of psr j1907 + 0631 is provided by the fact that it has glitched , as discussed in  [ sec : glitches ] .",
    "the ages and locations of the pulsars in the galactic plane suggest that they might be associated with supernova remnants and/or pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "we have therefore studied the regions around each pulsar for such structures .",
    "an inspection of green s catalog @xcite quickly revealed that psr  j1907 + 0631 is located in snr g40.5@xmath00.5 . in figure [ fig:1907_snr ]",
    "we show a region of the galactic plane taken from the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ; @xcite ) at 1420mhz which shows that the pulsar ( red cross ) is in fact very close to the center ( blue cross ; raj = 19:07:08.6 , decj = 06:29:53 ) of the remnant .",
    "we have used the position of the center of the nebula derived by @xcite , which is based on the morphology of the nebula , rather than the previous position obtained by langston et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which was based on single dish radio measurements and which were biased by the bright rim of the asymmetric remnant .",
    "it is interesting to note that there appears to be a region of enhanced radio emission at the position of psr  j1907 + 0631 which might be from a pulsar wind nebula ; further multi - wavelength study is required to confirm this .",
    "the age of g40.50.5 is often quoted as being 2040 kyr @xcite which is broadly consistent with the derived characteristic age of the pulsar .",
    "this age is based upon an estimate of the distance to the remnant that ranges between 5.5 and 8kpc and is derived from various @xmath26 relations which relate the diameter of a remnant to its observed radio surface brightness @xcite .",
    "yang et al . ( 2006 ) study the molecular gas distribution around the remnant and also derive their own @xmath26 distance of 5.3kpc .",
    "we note that such distances based upon @xmath26 relationships should be treated with caution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , yang et al . ( 2006 ) prefer a distance of 3.4kpc which they derive from the velocity of a co feature from shocked gas that they associate with the remnant and the distances from clemens et al .",
    "this contrasts somewhat with the ne2001-derived distance to the pulsar of 7.9kpc for the observed dispersion measure of 427pc@xmath27 .",
    "however as can be seen in figure [ fig:1907_snr ] and discussed in yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this is a complex region with many molecular features , while the line of sight to the pulsar and the remnant passes through the nearside of the sagittarius arm at about 3kpc and the far side at about 9kpc .",
    "there has been recent discussion about the possibility that the nearby gamma - ray pulsar j1907 + 0602 @xcite might be associated with g40.50.5 because of its association with the nearby tev source mgro j1908 + 06 @xcite which extends to include the lower limb of the remnant closest to psr  j1907 + 0602 ( see figure 1 of aliu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ) .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2010 ) found that this pulsar ( yellow cross in figure [ fig:1907_snr ] ) lies in the extended emission seen also with the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ; aharonian et al .",
    "2009 ) and the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ; ward 2008 ) .",
    "they noted however that the association with g40.50.5 seems very unlikely as it would require an extremely high transverse velocity and should have resulted in a bow - shock shaped nebula near the pulsar which was not evident in their @xmath28 x - ray observations .",
    "this is consistent with our belief that psr  j1907 + 0631 is in fact the pulsar that was formed in the g40.50.5 supernova event .",
    "the position identified by abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as the center of the remnant seems to be based on the apparently symmetric shape of the nebula .",
    "however they do not quote a position error and the clearly asymmetric intensity distribution of the 1400mhz radio emission could argue for an offset in the location of the progenitor star from their choice of position . despite this",
    ", we use their position for the purpose of deriving a separation of psr  j1907 + 0631 from the center of the remnant , which we find to be 1.8 arcminutes .",
    "assuming that the remnant distance is 3.4kpc and an age for the pulsar of 11kyr , this separation requires the pulsar to have an unremarkable transverse velocity of 155kms@xmath29",
    ". this would be approximately doubled , and still unremarkable , if the dm - based distance of 7.9 kpc for the pulsar were the true distance .",
    "deeper and higher resolution radio images of the remnant could confirm whether the radio emission close to the pulsar position is indeed a plerion and if it has a bow - shock - like form .",
    "the system may then be similar to psr  b1853 + 01 in w44 @xcite and we can learn more about the velocity and wind of the pulsar from radio and x - ray @xcite studies .",
    "psr  j1907 + 0631 falls within the field of view of this _",
    "xmm@xmath0newton _ observation which targeted mgro  1908 + 06 ( obsid 0553640801 ) .",
    "there is no x - ray source detected at the position of the pulsar .",
    "based on the measured dm and dm - derived distance of 7.9 kpc , we estimate the hydrogen column density along the line of sight to psr  j1907 + 0631 to be @xmath30 @xmath31 using the empirical relation from @xcite . given the non - detection , from the more sensitive epic pn data we place a 3@xmath32 upper limit on the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath33 ergs s@xmath29 in the 0.310 kev band .",
    "the implied spin - down to x - ray conversion efficiency ( @xmath34 ) of psr j1907 + 0631 is @xmath35@xmath36 , which is typical for young pulsars with comparable @xmath17 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "psr  j1925 + 1720 is not only youthful but has a sufficiently high @xmath17 that , despite a relatively large ne2001-derived distance of 6.9kpc , places its @xmath37ergkpc@xmath38s@xmath29 in the top 10% of all known pulsars .",
    "we have therefore sought the presence of any high - energy nebula that might be related to the pulsar .",
    "inspection of the _ fermi _ large area telescope 4-year point source catalog ( 3fgl ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveals that the radio position of psr  j1925 + 1720 places it 7.4@xmath39 from the high - energy @xmath2-ray source 3fgl j1925.4 + 1727 , at ra=@xmath40 dec=@xmath41 , with a 95% error ellipse of size @xmath42 , and position angle @xmath43 .",
    "although the pulsar falls outside of the error ellipse and the spectrum of 3fgl  j1925.4 + 1727 is not obviously pulsar - like , our investigation indicates that this is caused by the presence of an additional unmodeled source , which appears to be a common occurrence in the galactic plane ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for the case of psr  j1906 + 0722 ) .",
    "we note that at x - ray energies , psr j1925 + 1720 has been observed with _ swift _",
    "xrt for a total effective exposure of 3.4 ks .",
    "no sources are apparent in the resulting x - ray image .",
    "taking dm=223.3 pc @xmath27 and @xmath44 kpc for the pulsar , we estimate @xmath45 @xmath31 as per @xcite . from the available x - ray data ,",
    "we then obtain a 3@xmath32 upper limit of @xmath46 ergs s@xmath29 ( 0.310 kev ) on the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the implied @xmath47 is consistent with @xmath48 observed for analogous energetic pulsars ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed analysis of the @xmath2-ray emission from psr  j1925 + 1720 will be presented in a follow - up publication ( s.  bogdanov et al . in prep . ) .",
    "shortly after its discovery , timing observations of this 1.86-second pulsar with the lovell telescope indicated that the period was changing rapidly , presumably due to the doppler effect arising from its motion in a binary orbit with a companion star .",
    "subsequent observations confirmed this , and showed it to be in an essentially circular orbit .",
    "the parameters resulting from a full fit to the timing data of this pulsar are given in table  [ table:1932 ] .",
    "the orbital period , eccentricity and spin characteristics of the psr  j1932 + 1500 binary system are very similar to those of a previously known pulsar , psr  j1822@xmath00848 @xcite .",
    "the spin period and period derivatives of both pulsars indicate that they were only mildly recycled - in the @xmath10 - @xmath11 diagram they are located in the region where most so - called `` normal '' pulsars lie .",
    "however , as described below they must have experienced some accretion and spin - up .",
    "the orbital eccentricities of these systems ( 0.0289 and 0.0589 for psrs j1932 + 1500 and j1822@xmath00848 respectively ) and the estimated companion masses ( @xmath49 for both systems ) provide important clues about their previous evolution .",
    "both eccentricities are much smaller than for truly unrecycled , recently formed pulsars in binary systems , such as psrs j0045@xmath07319 , b1259@xmath063 , j1638@xmath04725 , j1740@xmath03052 and j2032 + 4127 @xcite , where the pulsars are very young with no signs of significant prior accretion and their massive ( from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) companion stars have not yet entered their giant phases . in these cases",
    "the orbital eccentricities range from 0.6 to 0.96 , implying that there has been no time yet for tidal circularization . that will eventually happen when the companion stars evolve into giant stars",
    ": their sizes will then be comparable to the minimum orbital separation , and tidal effects will then be very important .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that the orbits of psrs  j1932 + 1500 and j1822@xmath00848 have been tidally circularized by their companion in a previous giant stage of their evolution .",
    "this was not merely a dynamical interaction",
    " it probably affected the pulsars as well : their @xmath10 and @xmath11 put them just below the spin period - magnetic field equilibrium line of @xcite for accretion at the eddington rate , i.e. their spin characteristics are consistent with mild accretion by mass transfer from the envelope of the companion .",
    "furthermore , their minimum masses follow the tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) relation for their orbital periods ( see fig . 4 in that paper ) .",
    "there are quite a few other moderately recycled pulsars with longer orbital periods that we list in table  [ table : wide - orbits ] , the longest being psr  b0820 + 02 ( manchester et al . 1980 ) , with @xmath52 days , where the companion is a 0.6 - 0.7 m@xmath53 wd @xcite .",
    "many of these binaries ( notably psrs j0214 + 5222 , j2016 + 1947 , j0407 + 1607 , j1711@xmath04322 and j1840@xmath00643 ) have much shorter spin periods , much smaller b - fields and smaller orbital eccentricities , which places them more in line with the predictions of the convective fluctuation - dissipation theory of @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for psrs  j1932 + 1500 and j1822@xmath00848 : although small , their eccentricities are @xmath541.5 orders of magnitude larger than the prediction of phinney ( 1992 ) , as can be seen in figure [ fig : pb_ecc ] .",
    "the reasons for these differences are not clear . even if psrs  j1932 + 1500 and j1822@xmath00848 had much stronger b - fields to start with , or perhaps the accretion and related b - field burial was not as efficient , that would not explain why the orbital eccentricities are so much higher than for the other recycled pulsars with wide orbits .",
    "a possible explanation for the characteristics of psr  j1822@xmath00848 was advanced by @xcite . in their scenario ,",
    "psr  j1822@xmath00848 was initially a non - recycled pulsar in a wide , eccentric orbit .",
    "when its companion reached the asymptotic giant branch stage , the system experienced weak spiral - in ( and relatively inefficient orbital circularization ) from an almost unbound common envelope .",
    "this might explain its spin characteristics ( very weak recycling , if at all ) and its current orbital period and eccentricity , both of which are much smaller than for the unrecycled pulsar - o - b star systems .",
    "this hypothesis would also explain the characteristics of psr  j1932 + 1500 .",
    "the optical characteristics of the companion of psr  j1932 + 1500 represent an important constraint on the nature and evolution of this system .",
    "there is a faint candidate in the sdss @xcite at coordinates @xmath55 .",
    "the angular offset from the pulsar position is 1.3@xmath56 ; this is significantly larger than the astrometric uncertainties of the catalog ( 0.15 arcseconds , http://classic.sdss.org/dr7/instruments/technicalpaper/index.html ) and more than 3 times the 1-@xmath32 positional uncertainty of the pulsar ( 0.4@xmath56 ) .",
    "this source is not detectable in the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "the significant offset leads us to conclude that the sdss source is unrelated to the pulsar ; its proximity is the result of the large density of stars detected by sdss in this region of the sky .",
    "this non - detection of the companion star suggests that it is a compact object , as predicted by the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "timing observations of these two pulsars , with periods of around 0.3  s , showed that they both suffered large glitches in their rotation rates during the timing program , with fractional increases of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "however , the evolution of the rotational frequencies and their first derivatives shown in figure [ fig : glitches_f0f1 ] , and the relevent parameters summarised in table  [ table : glitches ] , reveal that they are very different events .",
    "psr  j1907 + 0631 , with a characteristic age of 11  kyr , is a young vela - like pulsar , still surrounded by a visible snr and a plerionic nebula (  [ sec : young ] ) .",
    "the observed glitch in this pulsar ( figure [ fig : glitches_f0f1 ] ) is also typical of glitches in the vela pulsar and similar pulsars such as b1727@xmath033 , b1800@xmath021 and b1823@xmath013 , having characteristic ages of 10 - 20  kyr @xcite .",
    "such glitches are characterised by fractional increases in spin - rate of a few parts per million , followed by a short - term recovery which is completed on a timescale of typically two hundred days , leading into a period of approximately constant @xmath59 until the next glitch occurs . during this last phase ,",
    "the braking index , @xmath60 , takes a large value of a few 10s , and is about 10 in the case of j1907 + 0631 .",
    "this compares with the expected value of @xmath61 for normal magnetic braking of a rigid neutron star with a constant dipolar magnetic field .",
    "note that the step in rotational frequency at the glitch is seen to be a minor perturbation in the systemic spin - down of the pulsar , and `` undoes '' only 17 days of spin - down .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : glitches_f0f1 ] that psr  j0611 + 1436 , with a characteristic age of 1.1 myr , shows essentially no short - term transient behavior following the even larger glitch in frequency , and will take @xmath5412 years to slow down to the pre - glitch rotation rate .",
    "this is an extreme recovery time which is not surpassed by glitches in any other normal pulsar , the next largest being 4.9 yr in psr  b0355 + 54 @xcite and 4.5 yr in b1535@xmath056 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : glitches_f0f1 ] also shows that the interglitch rotation rate is dominated by stochastic variations due to timing noise which is prevalent in pulsars of intermediate age @xcite .",
    "the different recovery behavior of glitches between young and intermediate - age pulsars has been pointed out before by @xcite and studied more recently by @xcite .",
    "it seems that the properties may be related to the decreasing amount of superfluid neutrons as pulsars age .",
    "we also note that glitch recoveries in magnetars also show great diversity @xcite and may also involve changes in the neutron star magnetospheres . in this context",
    ", it is notable that psr  j1907 + 0631 has a large surface magnetic field of just over @xmath62 g , which is greater than that of 98% of the known radio pulsars .",
    "the deep search of the galactic plan undertaken by the palfa survey has revealed another 29 normal pulsars .",
    "the excellent sensitivity of the survey and high frequency resolution of the two data acquisition systems used means that these pulsars have large dispersion measures and are located at a median distance of 7.0kpc .",
    "this value is very similar to the 7.1kpc of the 35 slow palfa pulsars presented by @xcite , who already noted that this was much larger than the median distance for the known galactic population of 4.2kpc ( calculated using the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite ) .",
    "the profiles presented here are indistinct from the normal pulsar population , although a handful do show evidence for scattering and combined with the dispersion measure can be added to the palfa sample to aid in modelling the ionised interstellar medium in the survey region @xcite .",
    "this could be enhanced by further observations of this sample at lower frequencies .",
    "the combined total of 64 pulsars presented in this paper and in @xcite are just the first of the `` normal pulsars '' discovered in this survey .",
    "the ongoing palfa survey has to date discovered more than 169 pulsars and , as they probe a unique section of the pulsar population in our galaxy , they will provide an important statistical sample for modelling the galactic pulsar population and the distribution of the magneto - ionic medium .    as well as adding to the population as a whole , the sample presented here includes two new young pulsars which both show evidence of interacting with the local medium .",
    "psr j1907 + 0631 lies close to the centre of snr g40.50.5 and thus likely solves the issue of which of the many neutron stars in the area are associated with the remnant .",
    "this not only secures another snr - pulsar association for further detailed study , it clarifies some of the likely properties of pulsars like the gamma - ray source psr j1907 + 0602 which had a claim of association .",
    "it may also help understand the origin of the tev emission seen in this region .",
    "the youthful and high-@xmath17 pulsar j1925 + 1720 might be a gamma - ray source or be powering a high - energy nebula .",
    "psr  j1907 + 0631 also exhibited a glitch , as did j0611 + 1436 , and , although they were both large events , they exhibited very different period and period - derivative evolutions which not only mark them as interesting sources to continue to monitor but also provide important additional data for our understanding of the nature of glitches .",
    "the long period binary pulsar j1932 + 1500 appears to form a group of two with psr j18220848 that have formed in a system which initially had a wide , eccentric orbit , that underwent only modest spiral in and thus relatively inefficient orbital circularisation and likely has a compact companion .",
    "this source highlights the wide range of possible outcomes that are possible in the evolution of binary systems which later form at least one neutron star .",
