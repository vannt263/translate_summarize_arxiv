    "the only previously known results are that the log - rank conjecture for xor functions holds for all _ symmetric _ functions  @xcite , monotone functions and linear threshold functions ( ltfs )  @xcite , and @xmath43 functions ; see section [ sec : relatedwork ] for more details .",
    "one nice approach proposed in @xcite is to first design an efficient _ parity decision tree _ ( pdt ) for computing @xmath2 , and then to simulate it by a communication protocol .",

    "it is therefore sufficient to show that @xmath49 for all @xmath2 to prove the log - rank conjecture for xor functions parity decision tree complexity is an interesting complexity on its own , with connections to learning @xcite and other parity complexity measures such as parity certificate complexity and parity block sensitivity @xcite .",
    "this approach is also appealing for the purpose of understanding boolean functions with sparse fourier spectra .",
    "it is not hard to see that small @xmath48 implies fourier sparsity ; now if @xmath49 is true , then functions with small fourier sparsity also have short parity decision trees .",
    "thus the elusive property of being fourier sparse is roughly equivalent to the combinatorial and computational property of having small pdt . back to the log - rank conjecture , though upper bounds for @xmath50 translate to efficient protocols for @xmath4 , the task of designing efficient pdt algorithms itself does not seem to be an easy task . to see this , let us examine the effect of parity queries .",
    "each query `` @xmath51 '' basically generates two subfunctions through restriction , and its effect on the fourier domain can be shown to be @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the subfunction obtained from restricting @xmath2 on the half space @xmath54 . thus the process is like to fold the spectrum of @xmath2 along the line @xmath55 , and we hope that the folding has many `` collisions '' in nonzero fourier coefficients , namely many @xmath56 , with @xmath57 as well .",
    "in general , small @xmath50 implies that many fourier coefficients are `` well aligned '' with respect to a subspace @xmath58 with a small co - dimension , so that querying basis of @xmath59 make those fourier coefficients collide .",
