    "calculations of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath1 ( epc ) @xcite can be made from band parameters coming from self - consistent electronic structure results based on density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . in this formalism",
    "we write the epc as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the density - of - states ( dos ) at the fermi energy , @xmath4 is an atomic mass , @xmath5 is the averaged phonon frequency ( @xmath6 is a force constant @xmath7 , the second derivative of the total energy , @xmath8 , with respect to the atomic displacement @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the matrix element @xmath11 evaluated at the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the electron potential ) .",
    "@xmath10 can be determined from the change in electron energies , @xmath14 , in `` frozen '' phonon calculations @xcite .",
    "such calculations show generally that @xmath10 is large only when @xmath15 is close to @xmath16 , the momentum for the phonon .",
    "the matrix element is constant for harmonic vibrations , @xmath17 .",
    "the same formalism can be applied for coupling to spin fluctuations ( sf ) essentially by replacing displacements @xmath18 by magnetic moments @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "most doped cuprates have very simple fermi surfaces ( fs ) , and retaining that @xmath10 is large only for @xmath20 , allow us to calculate most of the coupling from a few phonon distortions only @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by rewriting the bcs equation for @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath21    as @xcite ; @xmath22 it becomes clear that superconductivity is possible when the cost in total vibrational energy ( @xmath23 ) of participating phonons is smaller than a fraction ( depending on the @xmath24-function ) of the gain in electron energy ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "then , for a simple fs , it is possible to have a large @xmath0 despite a low value of @xmath3 , because the energy cost from excitations of only a few phonons will be small @xcite .",
    "phonons , spin - fluctuations and charge - waves are all possible excitations for activation of superconductivity , but only if the electronic energy gain can overcome the excitation energy . for conventional superconductors",
    "we usually ignore everything except phonons when @xmath0 is to be estimated . here , for cuprates it is more complicated , since we assume that only part of the phonon- and spin - fluctuation spectra should be counted .",
    "internal coupling within the simple fs opens the possibility for @xmath26-wave superconductivity depending on the strength of electron - electron repulsion @xcite .    from such arguments we claim that the normally estimated couplings to phonons and spin fluctuations can explain large @xmath0 s , at least quantitatively .",
    "lattice deformations can influence magnetism and other t - dependences of physical properties @xcite .",
    "in the cuprates this leads to spin - phonon coupling ( spc ) , where phonon distortions will enforce anti - ferro magnetic ( afm ) excitations and vice - versa ( and @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering experiments show indications of coupling between magnetic and lattice modes @xcite .",
    "thus , spc might be important for high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "but the constructive spc in the cuprates will degrade at large t because of disorder , and if superconductivity is mediated by few spc modes only , it is probable that superconductivity will suffer at high @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "superconductors with complicated fs s and multiple phonon modes , like transition metals and their compounds , do not have this problem , partly because spc is not likely to be important , but also because @xmath0 is not very high .",
    "the simulation of epc and spc by frozen phonon- and spin - wave calculations opens the possibility how sensitive the superconductivity carrying modes are to lattice disorder . here",
    "we will include thermal disorder and zero - point motion ( zpm ) in the lattice together with the phonons and spin waves in order to see how the waves , band gaps , coupling and @xmath0 are modified .",
    "thermal disorder is shown to be important for ground state properties @xcite and spectroscopic responses @xcite in different materials .",
    "even zpm is important for some properties , and since @xmath0 can be of the order 100k in cuprates we approach a regime where band broadening becomes large in comparison to superconducting gaps and peaks in the density - of - state ( dos ) .",
    "this will be investigated below for la@xmath28ba@xmath29cuo@xmath30 .",
    "finally we also present preliminary results of how ordering of impurities into stripes can be useful to diminish the bad effects of disorder on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the band structures are calculated by the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method @xcite and the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite .",

    "this displacement amplitude @xmath36 ( which corresponds to thermally activated phonons at room temperature , rt ) is large enough to obtain precise values of @xmath37 and @xmath10 in the harmonic approximation .",
    "the results for cells having phonon- _ and _ spin - waves show a general enforcement of both waves , and enhanced coupling parameters , as shown previously @xcite .",
    "in addition , the frozen phonon calculations show that @xmath38 is large near @xmath39 ( @xmath40 defines the afm on near neighbor cu sites , and @xmath41 defines the long - range modulation ) , and very small elsewhere . the calculations for ordered cells or with frozen phonons will be complemented by other sets of supercells , where all atomic positions are displaced randomly with average displacements @xmath18 , in order to simulate thermal disorder .",
    "the cuprate fs s are 2-dimensional cylinders . the fs becomes almost diamond shaped at optimal doping , when the fs reaches the x - point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and the dos has a van - hove singularity peak @xcite .",
    "the calculated coupling strength for phonon / spin waves at @xmath42 is much less efficient than for the wave in fig .",
    "[ figstr ] .",
    "this is because of the high local dos , and low band dispersion , near the @xmath43-point ( 1/2,0,0 ) .",
    "therefore , the wave makes easily a gap near this point , where the coupling is large .",

    "the fs at optimal doping is wide near ( 1/2,0,0 ) , where the fermi velocity is low @xcite , and becomes narrower when @xmath15 is approaching ( 1/4,1/4,0 ) because of larger band dispersion .",

    ", @xmath0 becomes of the order 15 @xmath48 .",
    "higher values are obtained if spin fluctuations and spc are included @xcite , but all these estimations are very approximate .",
    "it can be noted that @xmath0 in ba@xmath51cuo@xmath52 is reported to be much larger than in la@xmath51cuo@xmath30 @xcite . a possible reason could be that fewer apical oxygens make the interplane interaction weaker , so that the fs becomes even narrower than in la@xmath51cuo@xmath30 @xcite .        .",

    "two sets of calculations are made with disorder , where @xmath18 are @xmath54 and @xmath55   , corresponding to zpm and at rt respectively .",
    "these distortions agree with isotropic values on la and cu in undoped la@xmath51cuo@xmath30 as measured by hfliger et al @xcite , while the measured values for o - sites are slightly larger .",
    "the measured distortion of planar o in the direction of cu ( the most important for the band gap at x ) is similar to what is used here .",
    "our calculated broadening ( @xmath56 ) of the paramagnetic bands is on the average 18 mev from zpm and about 25 mev at rt , and about twice as large in spin - polarized calculations , see table [ table1 ] .",
    "photoemission by kondo et al @xcite observed broadenings for states going from 0 to 13.5@xmath57 from the diagonal `` node '' direction on the fs , to be 6 - 9 mev at low t and about 22 mev at 175 k. extrapolation towards states further away from the diagonal ( and towards rt ) would probably give larger values in better agreement with the calculated band broadening .",
    "for comparison we note that spectroscopic broadenings at rt in li and na are much larger , 150 - 180 mev @xcite .",
    "this is because those alkali metals have very soft lattices so that the thermal disorder is very large when @xmath27 is close to the melting temperature .",
    "the average @xmath18 would be close to 10 percent of interatomic distances at melting according to the lindemann rule @xcite .",

    "the afm wave is perfectly developed in the ordered cell with only three values of local moment amplitudes ; the four sites at node positions have no moment , the four sites at the interior of the stripes have the largest , and the eight remaining ones have slightly smaller moments .",
    "this distribution of moments becomes more irregular for increasing disorder . at the afm nodes",
    "( cu without field ) small moments develop with disorder .",
    "it is seen that the average moment decreases with disorder for long - wave spin modulations and for large moments despite the positive contributions of @xmath62 that always come from the node sites .",
    "this is also shown in table [ table1 ] , even when both spin waves and phonons are present .",
    "differently , results for shorter waves ( in cells extending 4@xmath31 and 6@xmath31 along @xmath33 ) show that disorder can enforce weak local moments .",
    "this is similar to what is found for disordered cerium @xcite compared to ordered fcc ce @xcite , but only at the volumes near the onset of magnetism .",
    "a local volume expansion can increase the local moment , whereas a local compression can not decrease an already weak moment , and on the average there is an increase @xcite .",
    "overdoped cuprates are weakly magnetic and they have positive values of @xmath62 , at least for @xmath19 up to 0.4 @xmath63/cu .",
    "a positive average of @xmath62 can also be found in weak moment configurations with long spin waves due to strong contributions from node sites .",
    "not however that disorder destroys coherent waves in all cells , and the gaps at @xmath12 are more and more difficult to detect at zpm and rt in the cells of different lengths and different average moments .",
    "the effect of spc , demonstrated by the higher moment in a lattice with a phonon distortion compared to the moment in the ordered structure , is weaker in the disordered lattices .",
    "this is rather independent of doping .",
    "the coupling constant for sf appears to be more sensitive to disorder than the coupling for phonons , because the `` clean '' afm wave suffers a lot in the disordered lattice . instead of having a potential perturbation given by one fourier coefficient at a precise @xmath41",
    ", there will be several coefficients , each one working to open up gaps at different parts of the band .",
    "this has a direct negative impact on the gap .",
    "the maximal band deviation , @xmath59 , is found at k - points near the position of the downfolded @xmath43-point , i.e. in the region of the bz where the single phonon / spin wave opens up a gap .",
    "the two disordered configurations have large band broadenings at all k - points . on the contrary , at k - points where a well - defined wave makes a gap , disorder tends to wipe out the gap .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 is not revealing for the latter cases , since it might be boosted from disorder just at one k - point .",
    "the closing of the gap in the disordered lattice is seen from the dos functions in fig [ figdos ] .",
    "the thin line shows the dos for the non - distorted non - magnetic supercell .",
    "the @xmath3 is quite high since @xmath12 is close to the van - hove singularity for this hole doping , although the dos calculated from the limited number of k - points is not smooth . with the phonon and the spin - wave along the cell",
    "there is a gap and @xmath64 , as shown by the broken line .",
    "this dos curve changes to the bold line when all atomic positions are disordered , and there is no sign of a gap any longer .",
    "peaks and valleys in the dos appear at other energies for this particular ( randomized ) disorder , but the superimposed dos from several different disordered configurations becomes more smooth .    the next step is to project the parameters of band broadening from the ab - initio results on to the bcs dos function at different @xmath27 in order to extract the effect of disorder on the dos peak , on the superconducting gap ( @xmath65 ) and on @xmath0 .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ figbcs ] .",
    "the dos peak below @xmath12 becomes broadened , but its energy is essentially unchanged .",
    "the upper band edge will reach the lower band edge above the gap when @xmath65 decreases at higher @xmath27 .",
    "superconductivity disappears approximately when @xmath66=0 , although it could survive longer through a mechanism of percolation .",
    "small disconnected islands of fluctuating superconductivity can appear temporarily , and still produce a dos - peak below a pseudogap .",
    "the gap defined from the peak in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) can be larger than 50 mev in underdoped cuprates with the highest @xmath0 s , and the gap ratio ( @xmath67 ) is typically much larger than the bcs - value ( 3.5 ) even in cuprates with lower @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath6840 mev at low @xmath27 , as often found from stm for cuprates @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath0 near @xmath69 according to bcs theory .",
    "the zpm makes the dos - peak broad . in the spin - polarized results for the supercell we have a broadening of about 30 mev from zpm , which makes a reduction of the band edge to @xmath70 mev . at 150k , when a normal bcs gap would be reduced to @xmath71 mev , the broadening increases to about 40 mev .",
    "the gap would be closing at @xmath72 , which would be the corrected @xmath0 in this example .",
    "therefore , thermal disorder will reduce @xmath0 more than gap ( defined from the dos peak at 0k ) , which leads to a larger gap - ratio than in bcs . in the example above it would be 7.5 , and the dos - peak remains visible for @xmath73 . obviously , these results are only qualitative , but the general conclusions are ; @xmath74 that thermal disorder can produce superconducting fluctuations and a pseudogap above @xmath0 , @xmath47 that the gap - ratio is larger than the bcs value in underdoped cuprates , and @xmath75 that a higher @xmath0 is expected if disorder could be suppressed .",
    "band calculations show that the coupling parameter for spin - fluctuations goes up for decreased doping ( more than for phonons ) , and it tends to diverge before static afm makes the material insulating @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is on the underdoped side of the phase diagram that we can expect the strongest disorder effects on superconductivity .",
    "there is a competition between large possible @xmath0 and its destruction from disorder , because both mechanisms depend on the coupling parameter for spin fluctuations .",
    "the absence of superconductivity at low @xmath27 and very low doping can be because the increased coupling makes disorder important already from zpm , while this is not the case at higher doping .",
    "this makes sense since the effect of disorder is accumulated over a long distance and therefore more destructive for long waves at low doping .",
    "another possibility is that the increasingly long wave - lengths of the modulations at low doping make superconductivity sensitive to the short coherence length @xcite .",
    "long - range superconductivity is replaced by fluctuations in both cases .",
    "the simple relations of how @xmath1 and @xmath0 depend on @xmath76 , @xmath37 and @xmath23 , indicate ways for increasing @xmath0 if disorder plays no role .",
    "a different view of the high-@xmath0 problem , and how to increase @xmath0 , is possible if it turns out that the pseudogap at low doping is caused by superconducting fluctuations in a thermally disordered lattice .",
    "one could then recuperate a higher @xmath0 through stabilization of existing superconducting fluctuations , but it is difficult to get rid of thermal disorder .",
    "larger coupling constants for spin fluctuations should be efficient to enforce the `` clean '' spin waves .",
    "however , a large @xmath77 would also enforce fluctuations and bad influence from disorder could spoil the effect of enforced spin waves .",
    "structural disorder will be smaller in a stiffer lattice at a given @xmath27 , and since the spin disorder is largely an effect of the structural disorder , it suggests that lattice hardening would help .",
    "this can be achieved by applying pressure , @xmath78 , as long as the strength of the spin wave is preserved .",
    "a higher @xmath3 leads to a larger gain in electronic energy from a superconducting gap , and @xmath0 would be higher according to eq .",
    "[ eqlog2 ] .",
    "this is also valid at large disorder .",
    "broadening of dos peaks , which are not exactly at @xmath12 at low @xmath27 , can be favorable for increasing @xmath3 at large @xmath27 .",
    "another way to increase @xmath76 is to introduce new ( static ) potential modulations in the lattice @xcite .",
    "such modulations could be caused by ( natural or artificial ) dopant orderings , which make peaks in the dos at @xmath12 if the period is correct @xcite . in this case",
    "we imagine that the fs is not going to be more complicated , but that the band at @xmath12 becomes more flat .",
    "even efforts to _ decrease _ @xmath79 in order to avoid static afm , or suppress afm fluctuations , in the very underdoped region could have a positive effect on @xmath0 .",
    "this can be achieved by applied pressure .",
    "in fact , @xmath80 appears to be positive more so at low doping than in the overdoped region @xcite , even if other @xmath78-dependent variations ( phase transitions , charge carrier transfers within the structure ) can also modify @xmath0 .",
    "the conclusion from these results is that the effective @xmath81 can larger than what is generally believed .",
    "this is because the superconducting mechanism depend on few phonon / spin excitations .",
    "however , gaps and long - range phonon / spin waves are sensitive to disorder and there is a limitation of long - range superconductivity and @xmath0 because of thermal disorder .",
    "this is most likely at low doping where the coupling from spin - fluctuations is largest .",
    "a softened lattice may increase @xmath1 , but it also makes the amplitude of disorder larger . to increase @xmath3 by letting @xmath12 to be on a dos - peak should increase the effective @xmath1 even if @xmath37 is constant .",
    "this could therefore be a way to reach a higher @xmath0 through a moderation of the harmful effects from thermal disorder .",
