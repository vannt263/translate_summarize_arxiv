    "the chance of absorption mixing with line emission could lead to an underestimate of the flux ratio , since the mixing would preferentially lower the snr of the 5890    line ( see  [ sec : disc_structure ] for more discussion of emission line filling ) .",

    "the fits tended toward one of two solutions : an optically thick ( @xmath28 ) fit with covering factor @xmath29 , and an optically thin ( @xmath30 ) fit with @xmath31 .",
    "the one - component fits ( which also had lower snr ) tended to yield lower total optical depths than the two - component fits .",
    "we argue in section [ sec : weq_flux ] that the high-@xmath32 fit is generally the correct one .    accurately measuring the properties of the  absorption on the blue edge of the feature",
    "requires accurate modeling of the 5876    emission line in spaxels where it is present .",
    "emission line fits to 6678    were used to constrain the properties of 5876    emission .",
    "lines in f05189@xmath02524 are broad and blueshifted , and the 6678    line was fit with a single gaussian in the central spaxels ( it was too weak at larger galactocentric radii ) .",
    "the central wavelength and line width of the 5876    line were fixed to those of 6678   , while its peak flux was allowed to vary .",

    "the absorption and emission lines simultaneously leads to significant degeneracy in the best fit , since increasing the emission line flux and shifting it to the blue can be compensated for in the fit by increasing the absorption line equivalent width and shifting it to the red . to model the  in these spaxels ,",
    "the emission and absorption lines were thus fit separately .",
    "the feature boundaries determined from the empirical method were used to first fit the emission line only using data redward of the absorption line .",
    "the emission line properties were then fixed in the absorption line fit .    as a result of this method , it is possible that the emission line equivalent widths are underestimated and that their measured line centers are shifted redward of the true line centers .",
    "correspondingly , the absorption line equivalent widths could be underestimated and the measured line centers shifted blueward .",
    "this effect is explored in   [ sec : disc_velocity ] and [ sec : disc_structure ] .",

    "there is excellent correspondence between the empirical and fitting methods .",

    "however , the shape of the intrinsic agn continuum is unknown and the polynomial - only surface brightness profile is broader than the seeing disk .",
    "to more reliably model the spatially unresolved agn emission , the psf of the data cube was traced using the bright [ ] 6087    line ( which is unresolved even at _ hst_resolution ; @xcite ) .",
    "the agn - only continuum emission was then assumed to take the shape of this psf at the wavelength of and to contribute 50%  of the total ( or agn + stellar ) continuum surface brightness at the psf center .",
    "the normalization of the agn contribution is uncertain , but is broadly consistent with the more detailed photometric modeling of @xcite at _ hst _  resolution .    measured equivalent widths were corrected for the contribution of the agn by dividing w_eq@xmath34  by the fractional contribution of the stellar ( or total @xmath0 agn ) continuum to the total  continuum in each spaxel , as predicted by the psf model .",
    "low - resolution _ hst _  spectra suggest that the nuclear spectrum has little or no  absorption present @xcite , so correcting for the agn only affects the continuum level and not the  line shape .",
    "the resulting correction enhanced the nuclear values of the absorption line equivalent width .",

    "furthermore , the gmos spectra have a limited wavelength range , including only two balmer lines that are heavily mixed with emission .",
    "nonetheless , the stellar population age that dominates the luminosity of most spaxels is of order several 10s to 100s of myr .",
    "comprehensive modeling of large samples of ulirgs show that this is the typical age that dominates ulirg optical spectra @xcite .",

    "first , figures  [ fig : vel_v_r ] and [ fig : emvel_v_emweq ] could reflect the intrinsic spatial variation of the projected emission line velocities .",
    "if the outflow is an expanding thin shell of gas , then the resonant emission from the far side of the outflow will have a projected velocity that decreases with increasing projected radius .",
    "the correlation of velocity with equivalent width in this scenario then implies that @xmath73 decreases with increasing projected radius . in figure",
    "[ fig : vel_v_r ] two lines show the result of geometric projection of two thin shells , one with @xmath74  and @xmath75  kpc and the other with @xmath76  and @xmath77  kpc .",
    "this range of radii and velocities is consistent with the bulk of absorbing gas on the near side .",
    "a second interpretation is that the increase of redshift with decreasing equivalent width is due to emission line filling of nearby ( in wavelength space ) absorption , as predicted by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the neutral gas density can vary smoothly with ( actual ) radius , rather than being concentrated in a thin shell .",
    "filling of the line absorption by emission scattered into the line of sight in a given spaxel simultaneously decreases w_eq^abs@xmath49and @xmath73 .",
    "it should also reduce i^em@xmath48  and increase , since the line filling of a spherical wind ( at least in integrated spectra ) occurs preferentially near the systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "the fact that velocity also correlates with w_eq^abs@xmath49  can be explained in this model if the emission line equivalent width is most affected when the absorption is strongest ( i.e. , there is more absorption to fill in ) .",
    "the present data are only the second spatially - resolved detection of resonant line emission from cool gas in a galactic wind at low redshift ( and the first 3d observations at any redshift ) .",
    "these data thus uniquely constrain current models of cool gas in galactic winds @xcite , as well as serving as a benchmark for future observations and models .",
    "@xcite presented the first radiative transfer models of cool gas emission and absorption in simple , spherically - symmetric galactic winds that extend from the nucleus out to large radii .",
    "they persuasively argued that both absorption and emission are strong in dust - free spherical winds , that the absorption lines are blueshifted and the emission lines near systemic or redshifted , and that the emission extends over the entire wind area with a relatively shallow but declining radial surface brightness profile .",
    "this is broadly consistent with our data .",
    "in particular , we observe strong , blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission , as well as emission that extends across the fov .",
    "however , the emission is strongly suppressed in the nuclear regions .    to further explore an emission line model that fills the fov , figures  [ fig : sb_v_rad ] and [ fig : model ] compare the emission line data to a model assuming azimuthal symmetry in the plane of the sky .",
    "the model uses a srsic  surface brightness profile for the integrated  emission , @xmath78 .",
    "this profile was extincted by a foreground screen whose magnitude is inferred from the stellar continuum colors and convolved with the seeing . only points with low absorption - line contamination , to minimize emission line filling , were fit .",

    "the central region where only empirical upper ( lower ) limits exist for i^em@xmath48  ( w_eq^em@xmath50 ) and  absorption is the strongest , the model begins to deviate from the data ( bottom panels of figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "this range of w_eq^em@xmath50  also corresponds to the largest deviations of  from systemic ( figure  [ fig : emvel_v_emweq ] ) .",
    "it is likely that in these regions the emission and absorption lines are being affected by emission - line filling of the absorption lines @xcite . besides reducing w_eq^em@xmath50  and increasing for the emission lines ,",
    "this effect will also reduce w_eq^abs@xmath49  in these regions by up to @xmath72  , and may push the absorption line solution towards lower optical depths since the filling will preferentially affect the lower optical depth  line , 5896   .",
    "figure [ fig : nh_v_col ] suggests that the latter effect is small for most two component absorption line fits , but could impact the low snr , one component fits .    however , emission line filling is not the only factor responsible for the projected radial velocity profile of the emission line gas ( figure  [ fig : vel_v_r ] ) .",

    ", a radially thin shell in emission would be limb - brightened , contrary to the data , while a radially - filling wind would have the qualitative surface brightness behavior that is observed @xcite . however , radiative transfer effects can impact the naive expectation , and intermediate cases such as a thicker shell are also plausible .",

    "the emission , conversely , is almost invisible along these same lines of sight because of dust obscuration .",
    "along unobscured lines of sight , emission provides a view of the rest of the wind .",
    "this latter view is complicated by radiative transfer effects which lower the measured velocity if the wind is volume - filling rather than configured as a shell @xcite .",

    "the wind in this system extends to at least the edge of the fov ( 3  kpc ) , and is apparently optically thick to these radii in integrated line emission (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "deep long - slit observations may constrain the point at which the wind becomes optically thin , and thus the true size of the wind .",
    "this probe will be more sensitive to the true extent than absorption lines , since no background continuum is required and the equivalent width is increasing with increasing radius ( figure  [ fig : map_fitweq ] ) . the two high-@xmath5 examples also show a more extended outflow in emission than absorption @xcite .",
    "the collimation of the f05189@xmath02524 outflow is consistent with that of other ulirg winds , though the current data do not constrain the inner collimation .",
    "spatially - resolved studies of neutral , ionized , and molecular gas outflows in ulirgs reveal that the gas preferentially emerges along the minor axis of the nuclear disk at radii of @xmath72  kpc , but becomes less collimated at larger radii @xcite . if an observer could choose a random nuclear line of sight through a given wind , they would detect an outflow in absorption @xmath880%  of the time @xcite .",
    "the absorption line map of this galaxy is consistent with this result .",
    "although we detect nuclear absorption , our observations trace only one nuclear sightline through the wind .",
    "a clumpy and/or collimated wind could be less detectable through other nuclear sightlines .",
    "the data are consistent with a collimated inner wind if the nuclear disk is near face - on or an uncollimated wind if the nuclear disk is closer to edge - on ( there is no published data on the nuclear disk in this galaxy ) . our model for the observed",
    "emission is symmetric in the plane of the sky , but since it is detected only at scales @xmath590.5  kpc this is consistent with either an uncollimated wind or the decreasing collimation with increasing radius in other ulirgs outflows @xcite .",
    "these results also show that foreground dust is one of the primary drivers of the observed morphology of  emission and absorption in this galaxy .",
    "na atoms ionize easily ( the first ionization potential is 5.1  ev ) , so the spatial correspondence between absorbing na atoms and dust is natural , since dust can shield the atoms from ionizing radiation .",
    "the observed peak in  flux ( figure  [ fig : map_fitweq ] ) is deceptive , in that it more closely reflects the foreground screen than the actual distribution of emission line gas ( which in the model is azimuthally symmetric ) .      as is evident from many long - slit studies @xcite",
    ", high surface brightness resonant line emission is not a common feature of galactic winds in nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite list dust , wind asymmetry , and emission - line filling of absorption lines as possible physical causes of these non - detections .",
    "line emission is in fact present at low levels in stacked spectra of face - on galaxies with low dust attenuation @xcite , suggesting that both dust and asymmetry could indeed play a role in affecting detectability of  emission . at high @xmath5",

    "the @xmath43 values in f05189@xmath02524 are typical for a ulirg @xcite .",
    "the highest emission line flux is indeed in the region of lowest extinction and absent in the regions of highest extinction , but is detectable throughout the fov , up to 3 kpc from the galaxy nucleus . as for asymmetry ,",
    "the 3d structure of the outflow in f05189@xmath02524 is not constrained beyond the surface brightness emission model , but the data do not point to any unusual asymmetry that would affect the resonant lines differently than in other systems .",
    "the two high @xmath5 galaxies with extended emission have not only blue uv colors , but also high rest - frame blue luminosity compared to similar galaxies @xcite .",
    "a necessary physical condition for strong resonant lines is enough continuum emission at the same wavelength as the transition to excite the atoms out of the ground state .",
    "higher @xmath85-band luminosity could thus in principle strengthen  emission .",
    "in fact , within a nuclear aperture of 4 kpc , f05189@xmath02524 has @xmath95 , which is brighter than 90%  of ulirgs in the 1  jy sample @xcite and is negligibly affected by the nuclear point source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , most of the galaxies that are brighter than f05189@xmath02524 are seyfert 1s , in which the light is concentrated in an unresolved point source and possibly beamed preferentially along the line of sight to earth . excluding the seyfert 1s in the parent sample of ulirgs , f05189@xmath02524 is brighter than 95%  of the parent sample at @xmath85 , within a 4  kpc nuclear aperture . of the five non - seyfert-1 ulirgs that have lower @xmath96 than f05189@xmath02524 , four have been previously observed with long - slit spectra @xcite and one ( mrk  273 ) also with ifs @xcite .",
    "none show obvious emission .",
    "this suggests that the nuclear @xmath85-band luminosity of f05189@xmath02524 is responsible for the detection of extended  emission , though it may not in fact be a sufficient condition for its detection .",
    "however , deeper ifs observations of other dusty , @xmath85-luminous systems will be necessary to confirm this . in long - slit observations ,",
    "slit loss could be also a factor if the line emission is spatially extended at a low surface brightness @xcite , though that is clearly not a factor in the current data or in other ifs studies of @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it could be responsible for the lack of observed  emission in long slit data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , purely nuclear spectra in these dusty systems are less likely to show emission , since the nucleus is typically the most heavily obscured part of the galaxy and will be dominated by absorption rather than emission .",
    "several other nearby galaxies show resonant emission from metal lines , but there is presently nothing to distinguish their luminosities .",

    "its outflowing dust streamers , which are prominent in optical color maps ( @xmath101 ) , also show absorption .",
    "however , these streamers are less obscured than much of the  absorbing region of f05189@xmath02524 ( @xmath102 ; @xcite ) .",
