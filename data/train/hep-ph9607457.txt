    "the equilibrium thermodynamics of strong - interacting matter has been studied , up to now , by quite different approaches .",
    "apart from lattice simulations , most of the other studies rely on phenomenological models , which try to capture some relevant physical features of the theory @xcite .",
    "the absence of a common starting point in the literature is due to the non perturbative character of low energy qcd , and to the vicinity of the expected phase transition , at temperatures of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in employing analytical methods to study the transition , one is faced by this major difficulty of qcd , that of passing from the hadronic regime to that of quarks and gluons , based on the same fundamental lagrangian .    for very low temperatures ,",
    "important results have been obtained on the assumption that the thermodynamics of hadronic matter in this regime is that of a gas of weakly interacting pions @xcite , since pions are the lowest mass excitations and are thus expected to dominate the partition function . on the other hand , at very high temperatures , we expect a gas of almost free quarks and gluons .",
    "results obtained in these limits , which are both far from the temperatures of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration , can not help to explore the nature of the transition itself .",
    "for such an exploration much of the effort done so far is based on the mean field approximation to the effective potential at finite temperature for four - fermion models or other low - energy effective models of qcd .",
    "unfortunately , the mean field approximation neglects fluctuations , and it misses completely , in such a way , the role of bosonic contributions to the thermodynamical potential .",
    "these however should be , as already said , the relevant ones at very low temperatures .",
    "recently there have been attempts to recover some information missing in the mean field approximation , by means of the @xmath0 expansion , where @xmath2 labels the number of fermion species @xcite .",
    "in fact the role of scalar and pseudoscalar fluctuations appears at the first order of the expansion and allows to test their relevance in various regions of temperature . for the moment being these attempts have been made for the nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "here we present an application , based on a general scheme which allows for the @xmath0 expansion of the effective action in four - fermion models @xcite , to the gross - neveu model in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "we include in the lagrangian a current fermion mass to avoid infrared divergencies , and include the one pion - like composite states and the scalar composite . to verify whether their contribution to the free energy is dominant at low temperatures , we have to evaluate the effective potential at least at order @xmath0 . in the imaginary time formalism , we have to sum up over discrete matsubara frequencies twice : the first time for fermions , the second one for bosons .",
    "the effective potential at this order of the expansion appears as a sum of various terms .",
    "the first is the zeroth order , mean field term .",
    "it has a zero temperature part and a finite temperature part , obtained by summing over fermionic energies .",
    "a second term is a pure temperature term , obtained by summing over both fermion and boson energies .",
    "it contains a bose distribution function and it is expected to dominate in the expression for the pressure at low temperatures . in the following",
    "we show this to be indeed the case , and that in particular the largest contribution comes from the integration over almost on shell external pion momenta ( close to the pion propagator pole ) .",
    "the last term is a mixed one , a zero temperature term with respect to the sum over bose frequencies , depending on temperature through the bosonic propagator , obtained by summing over fermi frequencies .",
    "this part of the effective potential presents non trivial aspects which are interesting as far as the model itself is concerned , but its detailed study would go beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "actually we are primarily interested in showing how , by applying a general formula for four fermion theories @xcite , one can evaluate the pressure at order @xmath0 , and exhibit the role of pions at low temperatures .",
    "since the mixed term is subleading for very low temperatures and small quark masses ( see sect.5 ) , it does not appear in our final results .    in the following paragraph",
    "we give a review of the @xmath0 expansion of the partition function , for the case of the gross - neveu model in 1 + 1 dimensions . in sect.3 and sect.4",
    "we extend the formalism to finite temperature , and calculate the pressure at order @xmath0 . in sect.5",
    "we show the temperature behaviour of the pressure for the pure bosonic term discussed above and compare it to the mean field term .",
    "the results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "finally we summarize some useful calculations in the appendices , namely the analytic properties of the inverse bosonic propagator ( app.a ) , and the method employed for summing over the bosonic frequencies ( app.b ) .",
    "we start from the lagrangian of the massive gross - neveu model in @xmath3 dimensions  @xcite @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a multiplet of @xmath2 degenerate fermion fields , and @xmath6 is a bare fermion mass which explicitly breaks the chiral invariance .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion can be carried out as follows @xcite . according to standard methods the generating functional",
    "can be rewritten by introducing a scalar field @xmath7 and a pseudoscalar field @xmath8 @xcite . at vanishing sources",
    ", we have @xmath9}\\ ] ]          thus , the lagrangian for the @xmath15-field is given by @xmath16 -in{\\rm tr}\\log(i\\hat{\\partial } + \\phi\\cdot a ) \\equiv\\int { d^2 x}{\\cal l}_b(\\phi)\\label{boson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the identity _ log det = tr log _ , and carried out the trace over fermion indices .",
    "up to now we have simply integrated over the fermion fields , passing from a description in terms of elementary fermionic constituents to a description in terms of bosonic composites . at this point",
    "we are ready to expand the generating functional @xmath17 in eq.([zeta ] ) in series of @xmath0 . for this",
    "we follow the method of ref.@xcite , that we briefly review ( notice that we are now performing an @xmath0 expansion and not the formal @xmath18-expansion of the original reference ) .",

    "it is straightforward to verify that , apart from the linear term in @xmath51 , both @xmath52 and @xmath44 depend on the chirally invariant combination @xmath53 , which is the solution of eq.([gapw ] ) . from this condition",
    "it follows that the pseudoscalar component vanishes , i.e. @xmath54    the finite temperature extension is straightforward . for imaginary times",
    "we have @xmath55 while the finite temperature effective potential , obtained as the generalization to finite temperatures of eq.([gamma ] ) , is just the free energy density @xmath56 @xmath57    according to the @xmath0 expansion discussed in the previous paragraph , we can write @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the purely fermionic standard mean field term coming from the one - loop calculation ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the contribution of bosonic fluctuations ( @xmath63 ) @xmath64 \\label{free}\\ ] ]      expression ( [ free ] ) and ( [ mean ] ) put in eq.([state ] ) give the equation of state , when evaluated at the solution of the gap equation ( [ gapw ] ) at finite temperature @xmath66 which determines the evolution of the fermion condensate with temperature .    by following a standard renormalization procedure @xcite and evaluating the sums in the last term of eq.([mean ] ) @xcite ,",
    "the fermionic term @xmath59 can be written as @xmath67\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the dynamical fermion mass generated at @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the sums that appear in the bosonic part of the free energy , eq.([free ] ) , can be transformed into integrals by standard methods @xcite . in this procedure",
    "we must pay attention to the fact that the finite temperature inverse bosonic propagator @xmath71 has a cut across the origin in the complex @xmath72-plane ( for @xmath73 ) , besides the cut extending from the continuum threshold to @xmath74 ( that is present even at @xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "a detailed derivation is shown in appendix @xmath75 , from which it follows that the bosonic term can be cast in the form ( @xmath76 ) @xmath77 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow0}{1\\over2\\pi i } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{d p\\over 2\\pi } \\int_0^{+\\infty}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{d\\omega}~ n_{b}(\\omega)\\log\\left[{i d_j^{-1}(\\omega+i\\epsilon , p)\\over i   d_j^{-1}(\\omega - i\\epsilon , p)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from infinities independent of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , since the function @xmath80 satisfies the schwarz reflection principle , @xmath81 , by reintroducing the explicit dependence on @xmath79 and @xmath82 , we can write @xmath83 \\nonumber\\\\&&+ \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow0 } { 1\\over\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } { d",

    "therefore , in order to get a true @xmath0 expansion of the free energy density in eq.([free1n ] ) , we need also to expand @xmath90 in series of @xmath0 @xmath91 by requiring eq.([gap ] ) to be satisfied at each order in @xmath0 , we obtain that @xmath92 is the solution of the mean field gap equation @xmath93 whereas @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 finally , by inserting eq.([expansion ] ) into eq.([free1n ] ) , we have @xmath96 & = & n{\\cal f}_0(\\bar{\\varphi}_0(t),t ) +   { \\cal f}_1(\\bar{\\varphi}_0(t),t ) + \\cdots \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us now consider the pressure per fermion species , at order @xmath0 @xmath97 according to the previous paragraph the mean field pressure is given by @xmath98 whereas the contribution at order @xmath0 can be separated into two terms @xmath99 \\label{press1n}\\\\ & & -\\sum_{j=\\sigma,\\pi } \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow0 } { 1\\over\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } { d p\\over 2\\pi}\\int_0^{+\\infty}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{d\\omega}~ n_{b}(\\omega)\\left[{\\rm arg}\\left ( i d_j^{-1}(\\omega+i\\epsilon , p ; \\bar{\\varphi}_0,t)\\right)-\\pi\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      let us first comment on the second term in eq.([press1n ] ) , which is the one expected to give the dominant bosonic behaviour at low temperatures . actually such a term contains the bose distribution function @xmath100 , and , if @xmath65 were the inverse free bosonic propagator , it would correspond to the standard pressure for a free boson gas @xcite , and as such it would contain the typical temperature behaviour of a gas of spinless particles .    even in the case of the inverse propagator having a more complex structure , the major contribution to the pressure at low temperatures should come from the integration over the region containing the poles corresponding to the composite bosons .",
    "in particular , since the pion corresponds to the lowest bosonic mass excitation because of its pseudogoldstones nature , it characterizes the thermodynamics at low temperatures , where the leading behaviours are of the form @xmath101 , for the particles of mass @xmath102 .",
    "notice that in the present work we are including an explicit symmetry breaking , avoiding infrared divergencies related to the low dimensionality of the model . if one could go continuously to the massless case",
    ", one would recover the power law behavior in @xmath82 of the thermodynamical quantities in the pion sector , evidencing the role of the pions as goldstone bosons associated to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .    in conclusion the pion term in the second sum of eq.([press1n ] ) is expected to dominate the total pressure in eq.([totalpress ] ) for low temperatures and small values of @xmath103 , which is responsable for the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry . in figs.[alpha01]-[sigmapi ] we show that this is indeed the case , in the present model .",
    "we notice that the gross - neveu model is peculiar since in presence of a bare fermion mass no bound states are present in the scalar sector ( see appendix @xmath50 ) .",
    "however this particular feature of the model should not affect its physical interest to mimic some aspects of qcd at low temperatures , where the contribution of the scalar pole is depressed since @xmath104 .",
    "let us now consider the first term in the r.h.s . of eq.([press1n ] ) .",
    "even this term has a temperature dependence , this time not through the bose distribution function , but through the fermi distribution functions appearing in the bosonic propagator at finite @xmath82 , obtained by summing over fermions frequencies .",
    "this term can be separated in a zero temperature part @xmath105 \\label{mixzero}\\ ] ] and a finite temperature part @xmath106 \\label{mixbeta}\\ ] ] with an analogous separation for the inverse bosonic propagator ( see eq.([dbeta ] ) @xmath107    @xmath108 is minus the zero temperature effective potential of order @xmath0 ( evaluated at the minimum @xmath109 ) .",
    "it is uv divergent and needs to be renormalized .",
    "the renormalization procedure for the massless gross - neveu model has been studied in literature @xcite , although an explicitly invariant expression for the renormalized effective potential at this order has not been given .",
    "however this term ( once renormalized ) is subleading , at low temperatures , with respect to pion pole .",
    "this can be verified by performing a low temperature expansion , and taking into account that @xmath110 depends on temperature only through @xmath111 , which has the following behaviour for low temperatures @xmath112 with @xmath113 thus , as @xmath82 goes to zero , @xmath110 is exponentially depressed with respect to the pressure term coming from the integration around the pion pole , since @xmath114 .",
    "let us now consider @xmath115 .",
    "we have verified numerically that at low temperature ( and small enough values of @xmath116 ) also this term is subleading with respect to the pion pole term .",
    "this can be in part understood from the fact that its temperature dependence comes from the fermi distribution functions , that , again , have an exponentially decreasing behavior at low temperatures , characterized by @xmath117 .",
    "in addition both @xmath118 and @xmath115 exhibit an imaginary part below a certain value of the quark condensate .",
    "this problem has been already noticed in literature for the zero temperature effective potential @xcite , and we will not go further in its discussion .",
    "a complete calculation goes beyond the scope of this paper , since the problems are specific to the gross - neveu model , whereas the dominance of the pion pole is surely a general feature of qcd .",
    "we now discuss the behaviour of the pure temperature pion pressure term discussed above ( see second line of eq.([press1n ] ) ) @xmath119 \\label{pure}\\ ] ] and we compare it to the mean field term , eq.([meanpress ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[alpha01]-[alpha001 ] , where we plot various terms of the pressure ( divided by the square temperature ) vs @xmath120 for different values of the chiral symmetry breaking parameter @xmath116 , and of the number @xmath2 of fermion species .      furthermore , to better identify the role of the pion pole , we have divided the integrations that appear in eq.([pure ] ) into two regions : @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xmath126 .",
    "the region @xmath123 is the one which contains the pion pole , and it is from here that the pressure takes its major contribution at low temperatures , always for small values of @xmath116 .    in fig.[alpha01]@xmath127 we show , for @xmath128 , the contribution to the pressure of the pion term @xmath129 in eq.([pure ] ) , decomposed as follows : contribution of the pion pole ( continuous ) and that coming from the integration over the region @xmath125 ( dashed ) . in fig.[alpha001]@xmath127 are shown the same quantities of fig.[alpha01]@xmath127 , for @xmath130 .",
    "as anticipated in the previous paragraphs , we see that at low temperatures the pseudoscalar bound state ( provided the current quark mass is small enough ) dominates over the mean feald pressure , reflecting the fact that the pion is the lowest mass state by virtue of its nature of pseudogoldstone .",
    "its contribution grows more and more as we decrease the bare fermion mass . in the massless case",
    "we would recover a power law behaviour in the limit @xmath131 , instead of the exponential one shown in figs.[alpha01]-[alpha001 ] ( i.e. the curves of @xmath132 and the one of @xmath133 containing the contribution of the pion pole would tend to a constant value and not to zero ) .    in fig.[alpha01]@xmath134",
    "we plot @xmath132 ( see eq.([totalp ] ) ) for @xmath135 ( short - dashed ) , @xmath136 ( medium - dashed ) , and in the mean field case @xmath137 ( continuum line ) . in this figure @xmath128 .",
    "the analog results for @xmath130 are shown in figs.[alpha001]@xmath134 .    finally , in fig.[sigmapi ] , we compare @xmath138 to the sigma contribution coming from the second term of eq.([press1n ] ) for @xmath128 @xmath127 and @xmath130 @xmath134 .",
    "although , as already noticed , the sigma term is peculiar in this model ( since there is no scalar bound state ) we show this figures to make manifest that its contribution is negligible at low temperatures , whereas , close above the critical temperature @xmath139 , the scalar and pseudoscalar fields have to be practically degenerate , since the chiral symmetry is almost restored ( there is no real restoration due to the explicit symmetry breaking term ) .",
    "we have applied a general formula , valid for four - fermion theories , to calculate the finite temperature effective potential at order @xmath0 in the massive gross - neveu model in @xmath140 .",
    "we have shown that the pion - like composite dominates the thermodynamics at low temperatures , correcting significantly the mean field approximation .",
    "we have shown in particular that the leading contribution at low temperatures comes from integration close to the pion pole .",
    "this feature , which is expected to be also general to qcd and related models , emerges clearly from our calculations .",
