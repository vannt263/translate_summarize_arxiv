    "the specified boundary conditions of the system are _ forgotten _ : in the bulk of the system one sees an invariant measure which depends only on the normal direction of the macroscopic surface  @xcite . from the lozenge tiling perspective ,",
    "these limiting measures are determinantal and they are parameterized by the relative proportions of lozenges .",
    "these measures match up with the dimer model on the infinite honeycomb graph which are the unique translation invariant stationary measures for any given normal direction  @xcite .",
    "stochastic growth models have been studied in many different guises .",
    "many of these studies have focussed around the 1 + 1 kpz universality class ; see for example  @xcite for surveys .",
    "the @xmath0 anisotropic case has not been as extensively studied  @xcite but there are , however , numerous results in connection with random tiling models  @xcite . one feature of these models which is of particular interest for this note is the _",
    "limit shape _",
    "this is the average profile which the stochastic interface fluctuates around .",
    "in particular , we focus on giving an elementary approach to computing the _ speed of growth _ , which is the growth rate of the stochastic growing interface under the prescribed dynamics .",
    "this is an important quantity since it determines the limit shape of the system .    in the work by borodin and ferrari  @xcite ,",
    "the speed of growth was obtained by computing the _ infinitesimal current _ and then taking the bulk scaling limit .",
    "the computation was relatively straightforward , but requires the knowledge of the correlations of particles or lozenges at two different times .",
    "recently toninelli in  @xcite , considered the same model and a generalized version of the dynamics for the infinite honeycomb graph using a _ bead _ perspective ; beads and the _ bead model _ were introduced in  @xcite .",
    "he shows that the model is well - defined for the stationary measure .",
    "this requires some effort since the dynamics allow , a - priori , infinitely long - range interactions , but under the stationary measure these interaction probabilities decay exponentially with the distance .",
    "the speed of growth was not determined in  @xcite .    by appealing to the underlying combinatorics of the model and the kasteleyn approach for dimer models ( e.g. see  @xcite ) , we are able to determine the speed of growth in the infinite honeycomb case , thus establishing the conjecture in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 3.6 ) ) ; see theorem  [ thminfinitesystem ] . from  @xcite ,",
    "the speed of growth @xmath1 is given by a specific ( unsigned ) off - diagonal entry of the inverse of the kasteleyn matrix , where the kasteleyn matrix is a type of ( possibly signed ) adjacency matrix  @xcite .",
    "the approach used is to first find a recursive formula for this particular entry for the honeycomb graph embedded on a torus which leads to a series , and then take the toroidal exhaustion limit .",
    "the resulting limiting series matches with the speed of growth defined through the dynamics under the stationary measure . to prove theorem  [ thminfinitesystem ]",
    ", we found a relation for the specific off - diagonal entry of the inverse of the kasteleyn matrix for any _ tileable _ finite honeycomb graph with arbitrary edge weights in terms of single times . as a consequence",
    ", we use this relation to motivate an algebraic proof that the expression for the speed of growth of the model in  @xcite and the speed of growth computed from the prescribed dynamics are the same ( the latter is a series with entries given by determintants of increasing size ) . in principle",
    "it seems to be feasible to obtain theorem  [ thminfinitesystem ] from theorem  [ thmfinitesystem ] by a precise asymptotic analysis and a careful manipulation of sums , but we did not pursue this since we are primarily interested in understanding combinatorial structures behind the identity .",
