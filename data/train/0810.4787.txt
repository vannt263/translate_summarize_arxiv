    "the discovery of graphene @xcite has created a need for efficient numerical methods to calculate transport properties of massless dirac fermions . the two - dimensional massless dirac equation ( or weyl equation )",

    "orthogonal_. ) the symplectic symmetry is at the origin of some of the unusual transport properties of graphene @xcite , including the absence of back scattering @xcite , weak antilocalization @xcite , enhanced conductance fluctuations @xcite , and absence of a metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "numerical methods of solution can be divided into two classes , depending on whether they break or preserve the symplectic symmetry .",
    "the tight - binding model of graphene , with nearest neighbor hopping on a honeycomb lattice , breaks the symplectic symmetry by the two mechanisms of intervalley scattering @xcite and trigonal warping @xcite .",
    "intervalley scattering couples the two flavors of dirac fermions , corresponding to the two different valleys ( at opposite corners of the brillouin zone ) in the graphene band structure , thereby changing the symmetry class from symplectic to orthogonal .",
    "trigonal warping is a triangular distortion of the conical band structure that breaks the momentum inversion symmetry ( @xmath2 ) , thereby effectively breaking time reversal symmetry in a single valley and changing the symmetry class from symplectic to unitary .",
    "breaking of the symplectic symmetry eliminates both weak antilocalization as well as the enhancement of the conductance fluctuations , and drives the system to an insulator with increasing size or disorder @xcite .",
    "as observed in computer simulations @xcite , the breaking of the symplectic symmetry can be pushed to larger system sizes and larger disorder strengths by reducing the lattice constant ( at fixed correlation length and fixed amplitude of the disorder potential )  but this severely limits the computational efficiency .",
    "the chalker - coddington network model @xcite , applied to graphene in ref .",
    "@xcite , has a single flavor of dirac fermions , so there is no intervalley scattering  but it still belongs to the same class of methods that break the symplectic symmetry of the massless dirac equation .",
    "( the symplectic symmetry is broken on short length scales by the aharonov - bohm phases that appear in the mapping of the dirac equation onto the network model . )",
    "both the network model and the tight - binding model are _ real space _ regularizations of the dirac equation , with a smallest length scale ( the lattice constant ) to cut off the unbounded spectrum at large positive and large negative energies .",
    "there exists at present just one method to calculate transport properties numerically while preserving the symplectic symmetry , developed independently ( and implemented differently ) in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "that method ( used also in refs .",
    "@xcite ) is based on a _ momentum space _ regularization , with a cutoff of the fourier transformed dirac equation at some large value of momentum .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to develop and implement an alternative method of solution of the dirac equation , that shares with the tight - binding and network models the convenience of a formulation in real space rather than momentum space , but without breaking the symplectic symmetry .",
    "a celebrated no - go theorem @xcite in lattice gauge theory forbids any regularization of the dirac equation with _",
    "couplings from preserving symplectic symmetry .",
    "( the problematic role of intervalley scattering appears in that context as the fermion doubling problem . )",
    "several _ nonlocal _ finite difference methods have been proposed to work around the no - go theorem and we will adapt one of these ( developed by stacey @xcite and by bender , milton , and sharp @xcite ) to the study of transport properties .",
    "the adaptation amounts to 1 ) the inclusion of a spatially dependent electrostatic potential ( which breaks the chiral symmetry that played a central role in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and 2 ) a proper discretization of the current operator ( such that the total current through any cross section is conserved ) .",
    "we implement the finite difference method to solve the scattering problem of dirac fermions in a disordered potential landscape connected to ballistic leads , and compare our numerical results for the scaling and statistics of conductance and shot noise power with analytical theories @xcite .",
    "our numerical method is relevant for electrical conduction in graphene under the assumption that the impurity potential in the carbon monolayer is long - ranged ( so that intervalley scattering is suppressed ) and weak ( so that trigonal warping can be neglected ) .",
    "massless dirac fermions are also expected to govern the electrical conduction along the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator @xcite ( recently realized in bisb @xcite ) . in that case",
    "the symplectic symmetry is preserved even for short - range scatterers , and our numerical results should be applicable more generally .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional massless dirac equation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the velocity and energy of the dirac fermions , @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential landscape , and @xmath7 is the two - component ( spinor ) wave function .",
    "the two spinor components of @xmath8 refer to the two atoms in the unit cell in the application to graphene , or to the two spin degrees of freedom in the application to the surface of a topological insulator .",
    "we note the symplectic symmetry of the massless dirac hamiltonian , @xmath9 the time reversal symmetry operator @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 the operator of complex conjugation ) squares to @xmath0 . the chiral symmetry @xmath12 is broken by a nonzero @xmath13 , so it will play no role in what follows .",
    "for later use we also note the current operator @xmath14    we consider a strip geometry of length @xmath15 along the longitudinal @xmath16 direction and width @xmath17 along the transversal @xmath18 direction . for the discretization we use a square lattice , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with indices @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . in the applications we will consider large aspect ratios @xmath25 , for which the precise choice of boundary conditions in the transverse direction does not matter .",

    "the @xmath30 transfer matrix @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 the symplectic symmetry of the hamiltonian requires that @xmath8 and @xmath33 are both solutions at the same energy @xmath5 , so they should both satisfy eq .  .",
    "the corresponding condition on the transfer matrix is @xmath34 the transfer matrix should conserve the total current through any cross section of the strip . in terms of the ( still to be determined ) discretized current operator @xmath35 , this condition reads @xmath36 , which then corresponds to the following condition on the transfer matrix : @xmath37    our problem is to discretize the differential operators in the dirac equation , as well as the current operator , in such a way that the resulting transfer matrix describes a single flavor of dirac fermions and without violating the two conditions , of symplectic symmetry and current conservation .      a local replacement of the differential operators @xmath38 by finite differences either violates the hermiticity of @xmath39 ( thus violating conservation of current ) or breaks the symplectic symmetry ( by the mechanism of fermion doubling ) . a nonlocal finite difference method that preserves the hermiticity and symplectic symmetry of @xmath39 was developed by stacey @xcite and by bender , milton , and sharp @xcite .",
    "these authors considered the case @xmath40 , when both symplectic and chiral symmetry are present .",
    "we extend their method to a spatially dependent @xmath13 ( thereby breaking the chiral symmetry ) , and obtain the discretized transfer matrix and current operator .    since the transfer matrix relates @xmath7 at two different values of @xmath16 , it is convenient to isolate the derivative with respect to @xmath16 from the dirac equation .",

    "the variance of the conductance is enhanced by the absence of intervalley scattering , and we have been able to confirm the scaling with increasing system size towards the expected limit @xcite  something which had not been possible in earlier numerical calculations @xcite because intervalley scattering sets in before the large - system limit is reached .     scaling with system size of the fano factor ( average shot noise power divided by average current ) in a disordered strip at the dirac point ( geometry of fig .",

    "holds for any choice of potential fixes the discretization of the current operator [ up to a multiplicative constant , which follows from the continuum limit ] .",
    "this is an appropriate point to note that current conservation could not have been achieved if the potential would have been discretized in a way that would have resulted in a nonsymmetric matrix @xmath215 .",
