    "one of the major issues in studies of spatially discrete systems is whether such systems can support solitary waves that travel without losing energy to radiation , which results in deceleration and eventually pinning of the solitons .",
    "the celebrated peierls - nabarro ( pn ) barrier @xcite is the reason that discrete systems do not generically support exponentially localized travelling solitary waves .",
    "the barrier corresponds to the energy difference between solutions for the on - site- and the inter - site - centred lattice solitons , with the latter usually having a higher energy .    in the class of discrete systems ,",
    "a ubiquitous model with profoundly important applications in physics and applied mathematics is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) @xcite .",
    "one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) equations of this type are fundamental models of discrete nonlinear optics , representing planar and bulk arrays of nonlinear waveguides coupled by the tunnelling of light between adjacent guiding cores @xcite .",
    "another well - known application of the dnlse in any dimension is the description of bose ",
    "einstein condensates trapped in deep optical - lattice potentials , which split the condensate into an array of droplets @xcite .",
    "the first attempt at finding travelling lattice solitons in dnlse was undertaken in @xcite , followed by a more systematic study in fedd91,dunc93 .",
    "the latter works indicate that travelling lattice solitons in the dnlse are accompanied by nonzero - radiation tails , which was confirmed by more recent studies @xcite .    while the most typical onsite nonlinearity in dnlse models is cubic , waveguiding arrays made of photorefractive materials feature the saturable nonlinearity , which strongly facilitates the creation of diverse discrete solitons @xcite , including solitary vortices @xcite , necklace - shaped sets @xcite , circular solitons @xcite , and symmetry - breaking modes @xcite . various higher - order soliton patterns , in the form of stable multi - charged vortices and supervortices \"",

    "it was thus found that the saturable nonlinearity readily supports travelling solitons in discrete media johansson , hadzievski .",
    "a reason for this property is the fact that the pn barrier can change its sign in the case of the saturable nonlinearity hadzievski , hence the barrier may vanish at isolated points .",

    "because of this , a genuinely travelling solitary wave should be an _ embedded soliton _ ( es ) , which can exist inside the continuous spectrum , as an exceptional solution ( note that the concept of ess , which was originally developed for quiescent solitons in continuous media @xcite , was later extended to moving pulses @xcite and to solitons in dynamical lattices @xcite ) . genuinely localized pulse - like solutions",
    "were then generated by finding zeros of the amplitude of the soliton s tail ( the tail condition \" , which is similar to that used to single out ess in the continuous family of delocalized intra - band quasi - solitons @xcite ) .",

    "this is a reason why broad , small - amplitude pulses are highly mobile , seeming like freely travelling solitons .    in this paper",
    "we apply , for the first time , a variational approximation ( va ) to the study of travelling solitary waves and their stability , as well as for predicting the location of the genuinely localized travelling solitary waves . in the context of dnlse with cubic nonlinearity ,",
    "the application of va was proposed to construct the fundamental onsite and intersite soliton solutions by using a trial function containing unknown parameters that have to be minimized using the euler - lagrange equations @xcite .",
    "the same va method has been applied recently to the cubic - quintic dnlse chong ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "we see from the figure that zeros of @xmath169 occur at @xmath171 ( i.e. , at @xmath172 ) . for the parameter values in fig .",

    "it is worthy of note that the plot of @xmath169 also has singularities which occur at exactly the same points as those in fig .",

    "( [ sin ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ integralfinal ] ) to find @xmath175 as a function of @xmath148 , and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the existence of the ess can be predicted by seeking for values of the parameters at which @xmath176 .",

    "it is seen that @xmath177 in all the figures , i.e. , truly localized solitons can not be directly predicted by the va .",
    "however , we can propose a conjecture , based on a phenomenological  consideration of the figures , that there are two zeros of @xmath169 on the left and right of a maximum of @xmath175 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ es1 ] we have the maximum of @xmath175 at @xmath178 ( i.e. , at @xmath179 ) , which is located between two adjacent numerically found zeros of @xmath169 .",

    "[ es2 ] , where the two zero - crossing points lie between maxima of @xmath175 , i.e. , at @xmath180 ( i.e. , at @xmath181 ) in fig .",
    "we have also computed ( not shown here ) the signed measure @xmath169 and @xmath182 for other combinations of parameter values , where we observed the same pattern .",
    "thus , we conclude that , with addition of a constant , function @xmath175 may be able to predict the location of the ess .",
    "we suspect that the missing constant , which amounts to the shift of the plot for @xmath175 vertically , is related to the choice of the ansatz ( see , e.g. , @xcite for different _ anstze _ accounting for the oscillating tails ) .      to determine the va - predicted stability of the soliton",
    ", we have solved the eigenvalue problem ( [ evpva ] ) . for the soliton shown in fig .",

    "in addition , for the soliton in fig",
    ".  [ comparedprofile2 ] , i.e. , @xmath185 ^{t}$ ] , the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath186 .",
    "as the real part of all eigenvalues is zero , we conclude that both solitons are _",
    "stable_. these results are in agreement with the numerical findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "two examples of bound states consisting of two solitons , found numerically , are presented in fig .",
    "[ boundstate ] , each for the same parameter values .",
    "next , we compare the prediction presented above with the numerical results shown in fig .  [ boundstate ] .",
    "for the parameter values used in that figure , we have @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "note that , in terms of the above analysis , the soliton centred at @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ boundstate ] is in fact soliton no .  2 .",
    "therefore , phase difference @xmath189 in this case is calculated as the phase of the soliton on the right minus the phase of its counterpart on the left . from the numerical results , the phase difference between the two solitons shown in the top and the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ boundstate ] is given , respectively , by @xmath190and @xmath191 both of which correspond to @xmath120 , hence @xmath192 is odd .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) , we find that the best fit to the numerically computed distance in fig .",
    "[ boundstate ] , i.e. ,  @xmath193 and @xmath194 , is provided by @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "considering the fact that eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) is based on a simple approximation ( eqs .",
    "( [ psi0 ] ) , ( [ bckg1 ] ) and ( [ bckg2 ] ) ) and the assumption that the interacting solitons have decaying oscillating tails , the approximation is in relatively good accordance with the results provided by the numerical solution of the full equation .    using the runge  kutta method , we have also carried out numerical integration of evolution equation ( [ dnlsph ] ) , with initial conditions taken as in fig .",
    "[ boundstate ] .",
    "the resulting evolution of the solutions is displayed in fig .",
    "[ numevolbs ] , where we see that both solitons maintain their shapes and positions for a relatively long time .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop the semi - analytical approach to seeking travelling solitons , based on the application of the va to the differential  difference form of the dnlse with the saturable nonlinearity , in the moving coordinate frame .",
    "the predicted shapes of the solitons are in good agreement with the numerical findings .",
    "the va is also extended to examine the stability of the travelling solitons , showing that they are stable , which is consistent with previous work @xcite .",
    "further , the va was developed to predict the locations of the exceptional solutions for genuine travelling solitons with strictly vanishing tails .",
    "bound states of two solitons were briefly considered too . in the latter case , the va predicts the distance between two solitons forming the bound state . in the numerical part of the work ,",
    "we have made use of the numerical scheme for the dnlse written in the moving coordinate frame , which is an equation of the differential  difference type . using the newton  raphson method , we have confirmed the existence of exceptional solutions for travelling discrete solitons ( which are embedded solitons \" , in this sense ) , earlier predicted by means of a different numerical algorithm .",
