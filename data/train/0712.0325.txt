    "a system composed of many nonlinear interacting units often forms a complex system with new emergent properties that are not held by the individual units .",
    "such systems describe a wide variety of phenomena in biology , physics , and chemistry .",
    "the emergent property is usually synchronous oscillations .",
    "examples include the synchronized activity in pacemaker heart cells , the cicardian rhythms , the flashing on - and - off in unison of populations of fireflies , synchronized oscillations in laser arrays , in josephson junction arrays etc . @xcite .",
    "the effect of time - delayed interactions , which arise from a realistic consideration of finite communication times , is a key issue that has received considerable attention .",
    "the first systematic investigation of time - delayed coupling was done by schuster and wagner @xcite , who studied two coupled phase oscillators and found multistability of synchronized solutions . since then , delayed interactions have been studied in the context of linear systems @xcite , phase oscillators @xcite , limit - cycle oscillators @xcite , coupled maps @xcite , lasers @xcite , neurons @xcite , etc .",
    "it is well - known that oscillators that interact with different delay times can synchronize @xcite , but the interplay of the interaction delays and the network topology is still poorly understood .",
    "here we review the main results of our recent work on the synchronization of chaotic logistic maps @xcite focusing on the interplay of delays and topology .",
    "we show that a network of delay - coupled logistic maps can synchronize , for adequate coupling strength , in spite of the fact that the interactions among the maps have an heterogeneous distribution of delay times . in the synchronized state",
    "the chaotic dynamics of the individual maps is suppressed and all elements of the network are in a steady - state , which is an unstable fixed - point of the uncoupled maps .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the synchronized dynamics when the delays are homogeneous ( instantaneous coupling and fixed - delay coupling ) , because with uniform delays the maps evolve in either periodic or chaotic orbits .",
    "we investigate the influence of the network topology considering four different types of networks : two regular ( a ring - type and a ring - type with a central node ) and two random ( free - scale barabasi - albert @xcite and small - world newman - watts ) @xcite . we find that steady - state synchronization depends mainly on the average number of neighbors per node but is largely independent of the network architecture ( i.e. , the way the links are distributed among the nodes ) .",
    "this is also in contrast with the homogeneous delay case , because when the delay times are uniform the synchronization of the network depends strongly on the connection topology @xcite .",

    "the regular ones are a ring of nearest - neighbor elements ( nn ) while in the second one we added a central node connected to all other nodes ( st ) .",
