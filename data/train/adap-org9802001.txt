    "the notion of conditional lyapunov exponents ( originally called sub - lyapunov exponents ) was introduced by pecora and carroll in their study of synchronization of chaotic systems@xcite @xcite .",
    "it turns out , as i will show below , that , like the full lyapunov exponent , the conditional exponents are well defined ergodic invariants .",
    "therefore they are reliable quantities to quantify the relation of a global dynamical system to its constituent parts and to characterize dynamical selforganization .    given a dynamical system defined by a map @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the _ conditional exponents associated to the splitting _",
    "@xmath2 are the eigenvalues of the limit @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5 diagonal block of the full jacobian .",
    "existence of the conditional exponents as well defined ergodic invariants is guaranteed under the same conditions that establish the existence of the lyapunov exponents _",
    "proof : let @xmath6 be a probability measure in @xmath7 and @xmath8 a measure - preserving @xmath9 mapping such that @xmath6 is ergodic .",
    "oseledec s multiplicative ergodic theorem@xcite , generalized for non - invertible @xmath8 @xcite , states that if the map @xmath10 from @xmath11 to the space of @xmath12 matrices is measurable and @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) and if @xmath15 then @xmath16 exists @xmath6 almost everywhere .",
    "if @xmath17 is the full jacobian @xmath18 and if @xmath18 satisfies the integrability condition ( [ 1.2 ] ) then the lyapunov exponents exist @xmath19almost everywhere .",
    "but if the jacobian satisfies ( [ 1.2 ] ) , then the @xmath20 matrix formed by the diagonal @xmath5 and @xmath21 blocks also satisfies the same condition and conditional exponents too are defined a. e .. furthermore , under the same conditions as for oseledec s theorem , the set of regular points is borel of full measure and @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the subspace of @xmath25 spanned by eigenstates corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath26 .",
    "for measures @xmath6 that are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure of @xmath11 or , more generally , for measures that are smooth along unstable directions ( sbr  measures ) pesins@xcite identity holds @xmath27 relating kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath28 to the sum of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "by analogy we may define the _",
    "conditional exponent entropies _ associated to the splitting @xmath29 as the sum of the positive conditional exponents counted with their multiplicity @xmath30 @xmath31 the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of a dynamical system measures the rate of information production per unit time .",
    "that is , it gives the amount of randomness in the system that is not explained by the defining equations ( or the minimal model@xcite ) .",
    "hence , the conditional exponent entropies may be interpreted as a measure of the randomness that would be present if the two parts @xmath32 and @xmath33 were uncoupled .",
    "the difference @xmath34 represents the effect of the coupling .",
    "given a dynamical system @xmath35 composed of @xmath36 parts @xmath37 with a total of @xmath38 degrees of freedom and invariant measure @xmath6 , one defines a _ measure of dynamical selforganization _ @xmath39 as @xmath40 of course , for each system @xmath35 , this quantity will depend on the partition @xmath41 into @xmath36 parts that one considers .",
    "@xmath42 always denotes the conditional exponent entropy of the complementar of the subsystem @xmath43 .",
    "being constructed out of ergodic invariants , @xmath39 is also a well - defined ergodic invariant for the measure @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath39 is formally similar to a mutual information .",
    "however , not being strictly a mutual information , in the information theory sense , @xmath39 may take negative values .",
    "another ergodic invariant that may be associated to the splitting of a dynamical system into its constituent parts is the notion of _ cylindrical entropies_.    consider , as before , a @xmath19preserving and @xmath19ergodic mapping @xmath44 and a splitting @xmath45 .",
    "a measure in @xmath46 induces a measure in @xmath25 by @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "given a @xmath50measurable partition @xmath51 in @xmath25@xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath51 , it induces a partition in @xmath46 by the associated cylinder sets @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the corresponding partition of @xmath11",
    ". denote by @xmath57 the element of @xmath58 that contains @xmath59 .",
    "if all powers of @xmath8 are ergodic , for any nontrivial partition @xmath60 where @xmath61 then , the shannon - macmillan - breiman theorem states that if @xmath62 the limit @xmath63 exists @xmath6 a. e. and converges in @xmath64 .",
    "this limit is the entropy at @xmath59 associated to the cylindrical partition @xmath65 .",
    "the _ cylindrical entropy relative to the splitting _ @xmath29 may be defined as the integral of the supremum of this limit over all finite cylindrical partitions @xmath66 the full kolmogorov - sinai entropy is a similar limit where now the supremum would be taken over all finite partitions .",
    "therefore for a smooth measure , if the parts of a composite dynamical system are all uncoupled , the full entropy is simply the sum of the cylindrical entropies . in the uncoupled case",
    "each cylindrical entropy is determined by the corresponding conditional exponents .",
    "however for coupled mixing systems , the cylindrical partitions may , by themselves , already generate the full entropy of the coupled system .",
    "therefore the relation of the cylindrical entropies to the total entropy is simply a _ measure of the statistical independence _ of the constituent parts .",
    "the conditional exponent entropies defined in ( [ 2.2]-[2.3 ] ) seem to be a better quantitative characterization of the dynamical selforganization .",
    "consider a fully coupled system defined by @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( mod .",
    "@xmath69 ) .    the lyapunov exponents are @xmath70 and @xmath71 with multiplicity @xmath72 .    therefore , for an absolutely continuous measure @xmath73 the conditional exponents associated to the splitting @xmath74 are @xmath75 and @xmath76 therefore , for a partition @xmath77 of the system with @xmath36 parts one obtains @xmath78 which in the limit of large @xmath36 becomes @xmath79 fig.1 shows the variation with @xmath80 of @xmath39 for @xmath81 .    at @xmath82 , and",

    "fig.2 shows the first @xmath84 time steps .",
