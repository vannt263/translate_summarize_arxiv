    "<S> the thermal nature of the propagator in a collapsed black - hole spacetime is shown to follow from the non - trivial topology of the configuration space in tortoise coordinates by using the path integral formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    the path integral ( pi ) formalism is useful to calculate propagators in configuration spaces ( cs ) endowed with a non - trivial topology , such as in curved spacetimes . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , even if the cs topology is trivial , this may not be the case for its euclidian section , where the pi should always be computed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in an eternal black - hole background or in rindler spacetime , although the cs itself has a trivial topology in kruskal or rindler coordinates , the euclidian cs has a periodic structure in the euclidian time - like coordinate . in these spacetimes </S>",
    "<S> endowed with an event - horizon ( eh ) , it can be shown that the thermal properties of the propagator follows from the periodic structure of the euclidian cs @xcite .    in a collapsing black - hole spacetime , </S>",
    "<S> however , this periodic structure is missing . </S>",
    "<S> one has to find in this case another procedure to obtain the thermal properties of the propagator . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this paper to show that a similar periodic structure may be recovered in tortoise coordinates if one requires that they cover the entire spacetime by allowing them to take complex values . in the resulting complex cs , </S>",
    "<S> the eh has a cylinder - like topology . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator is then obtained from a pi by adding all the contributions of the classes of path whith different winding number around the eh @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of this procedure is that the contributions of the paths crossing the eh are also included in the pi , which is not the case if the euclidianisation is performed in kruskal coordinates .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the simplest models for gravitational collapse is the synge model , where a schwarzschild black hole is created from an imploding spherical shell of radiation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall concentrate our attention on the spacetime region @xmath0 where the thermal radiation emitted by the black hole may be detected by an inertial observer . </S>",
    "<S> this region is defined to be located outside the imploding shell , far from the black hole and at late times . if @xmath1 denotes the kruskal coordinates , this region </S>",
    "<S> is defined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the position of the eh . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the line element is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and the tortoise coordinates @xmath7 are defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the schwarzschild coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the kruskal cs is given by @xmath12 and its homotopic properties are trivial .    </S>",
    "<S> the tortoise coordinates cover only the region @xmath13 outside the eh , and so can not be used to parameterise a path crossing the eh . instead of introducing another set of coordinates to cover this region , </S>",
    "<S> one extends tortoise coordinates to _ complex _ values , to keep a sense of connectedness for the cs . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible since @xmath14 , and thus the complex number @xmath15 describes a point inside the eh . </S>",
    "<S> the cs @xmath16 in tortoise coordinates is thus defined as the complex preimage of the cs @xmath17 through the transformation @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> since the transformation @xmath19 is periodic in the imaginary direction , a point @xmath20 has a infinite number of complex preimages denoted by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> they are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 y^- + i2\\pi\\nu/\\kappa , & \\mbox{{\\it if } \\ </S>",

    "<S> the complex cs @xmath16 is thus given  by @xmath27 \\times{{\\bbb s}}^2 \\ </S>",
    "<S> \\vert\\ r(y^+,y^-)\\geq0 \\,\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the set @xmath30 parameterises the eh ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cs @xmath16 is multiply connected and is represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the eh in @xmath16 is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a circle of radius @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental group of @xmath17 is thus isomorphic to @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the classes of paths are labelled by the integer @xmath35 which is the winding number of the paths around the circle @xmath32 .    in quantum mechanics , the amplitude to move from an initial point @xmath36 to a final point @xmath37 in a parameter - time @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> is given by the propagator @xmath39 , or heat kernel . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined as a pi with endpoints @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and is written symbolically as @xmath40 } , \\label{spx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the covariant sum over paths and action respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the set of paths on which the sum is taken is fixed by the cs @xmath17 and defines the _ kruskal vacuum_. if both endpoints @xmath36 and @xmath37 belong to the region @xmath0 , one may try replacing the metric @xmath43 appearing in the path integral _ everywhere _ by the metric of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ds0x ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of each path that ventures out of the region @xmath0 is changed , but we may conjecture that this will not greatly affect the propagator in @xmath0 , since this is a local quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of choice of the metric ( [ ds0x ] ) , which is the minkowski metric @xmath44 in tortoise coordinates , allows us to compute the propagator easily . because the propagator is a biscalar </S>",
    "<S> , one writes @xmath45 }   \\approx \\sideset{}{_\\eta}\\sum_{y(\\cdot)\\,\\in\\,{{\\cal t } } } \\   </S>",
    "<S> e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } s_\\eta[\\,y(\\cdot)\\ , ] } , \\label{spxy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus the sum may be taken over paths in the complex tortoise cs . </S>",
    "<S> the pi may be rewritten by summing over the classes of paths . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the entire class of paths with winding number @xmath35 gives the free propagator @xmath46 ( in tortoise coordinates ) with arguments @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the total propagator between @xmath47 and @xmath49 ( both in region @xmath0 ) is given by @xmath50 and represents an outgoing thermal flux of particles with temperature @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the homotopic properties of the configuration space are not an intrinsic feature of the black - hole spacetime , but depend on the set of coordinates chosen to cover it . since the inverse of the transformation relating kruskal and tortoise coordinates is not analytic , the cs @xmath17 and @xmath16 have different topologies . </S>",
    "<S> these properties have no physical consequences on the classical motion of a particle . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a quantum mechanical framework , a particle may tunnel across the horizon , and the topology of the whole configuration space is then physically relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation of a black hole is thermal because , from the point of view of a distant inertial observer , there is a denumerably infinite number of ways for a particle to tunnel through the horizon . </S>"
