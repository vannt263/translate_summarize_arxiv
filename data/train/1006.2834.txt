    "the distribution of stellar black hole masses in the galaxy is intricately related to the population and evolution of massive stars , the energetics and dynamics of supernova explosions , and the dividing line between neutron stars and black holes .",
    "inferring this distribution from observations helps address a number of outstanding questions in these areas .",
    "observations of mass losing evolved stars are one of the direct ways of studying the end stages of stellar evolution ( smartt 2009 ) . similarly , supernova and transient surveys ( e.g. , rau et al . 2009 and references therein ) provide increasingly larger data samples that have revealed a range of supernova properties and energetics that is wider than previously anticipated .",
    "studies of the end products of supernova explosions , namely of the black hole and neutron star mass distributions , provide a different and complementary approach to constraining models of massive stellar populations , evolution , and explosions ( timmes , woosley , & weaver 1996 ; fryer 1999 ; fryer et al.2002 ; woosley , heger , & weaver 2002 ; zhang , woosley , & heger 2008 ) .",
    "the mass distribution of stellar black holes is a key ingredient in the calculation of the event rates for gravitational wave observatories such as ligo , geo500 , and virgo ( abadie et al .",
    "in addition , inferring this distribution may shed light on the origins and properties of pulsar - black hole binaries ( narayan , piran , & shemi 1991 ) , which are believed to be some of the best laboratories for strong - field gravity tests ( wex & kopeikin 1999 ) .    during the last two decades ,",
    "the masses of a large number of black holes in x - ray binaries have been measured ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) , providing a sample suitable for the statistical inference of their parent mass distribution . using this sample , we find in this article strong evidence for a very narrow distribution of masses for black holes in transient low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "in particular , we show that there is a paucity of black holes with masses @xmath2 .",
    "our results confirm and strengthen an earlier finding of bailyn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who argued for a low - mass gap based on a limited sample of black holes .",
    "we explore in detail below known selection biases and demonstrate that the low - mass gap can not be attributed to the observational selection of targets .",
    "we further argue that the lack of high - mass black holes in low - mass x - ray binaries may result from a particular evolutionary path that leads to their formation .",
    "in tables 1 and 2 , we present basic data for all 23 confirmed black - hole x - ray binaries ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . for the purpose at hand ,",
    "we divide these systems into three groups : eight transient systems with orbital periods exceeding one day ; nine shorter - period transient systems for which the measurement of black hole mass is problematic ; and six systems with persistent x - ray sources and massive o / b - type secondaries . in these tables",
    ", we provide the following data for most of the systems : galactic coordinates , maximum x - ray intensity , orbital period , a distance estimate , mass function , mass ratio , inclination angle , and black hole mass .",
    "our primary focus is on the 17 transient systems listed in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "we summarize in table  3 data for thirty - two additional transient systems that are believed to contain black hole primaries based on the spectral and timing properties of their x - ray sources . for each of these systems , we give both celestial and galactic coordinates and the maximum x - ray intensity that has been reported .",
    "we now survey the constraints that have been placed on the masses of the 23 confirmed stellar black holes via dynamical measurements . in determining the masses of black holes in x - ray binaries ,",
    "the mass function @xmath3 is the most important and secure observable .",
    "the orbital period @xmath4 and the half - amplitude of the velocity curve of the secondary star @xmath5 can , in most cases , be determined precisely and accurately ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; charles & coe 2006 ) .",
    "these two quantities define the value of the mass function , which is an absolute lower limit on the mass of the compact object : i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the mass function relates the black hole mass @xmath7 , the orbital inclination angle @xmath8 , and the mass ratio @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass of the secondary star .",
    "values of the mass function , the inclination , and the mass ratio for the 23 established black hole binaries are given in table 2 .",
    "the mass - ratio estimates were obtained or derived from orosz ( 2003 ) and narayan & mcclintock ( 2005 ) , with a few refinements based on the references cited in the table .",
    "determining the black hole mass @xmath7 , the quantity of interest , is challenging because in many cases it is difficult to obtain secure constraints on the inclination and the mass ratio .",
    "table 1 separates the 23 systems into three groups based on their x - ray behavior : the persistent sources ( ps ) , the long - period transients ( lpt ) , and the short - period transients ( spt ) .",
    "this is important for understanding possible selection effects , which we explore in section  4 .",
    "table  2 , on the other hand , separates sources into three different groups based on the amount of data available on their mass ratios and inclinations .",
    "this impacts the inference of the masses of individual sources , which we discuss in section  3 .",
    "these tables sparely give for each source a few key references , which are supplemented by some additional references in the discussion that follows .",
    "these systems contain o / b - type secondaries and are persistently x - ray bright .",
    "five of them have relatively massive black - hole primaries , @xmath11 .",
    "however , the mass of lmc x-3 is presently poorly constrained : @xmath12 ( cowley 1992 ) . in the case of cyg x-1 , a very wide range of masses down to @xmath13",
    "has recently been considered ( caballero - nieves et al .",
    "however , recent vlba observations have shown that the distance exceeds 1.5  kpc ( m.  reid , private communication ) , which firmly establishes @xmath14 .",
    "there are two caveats on the mass constraints on ic 10 x-1 and ngc 300 - 1 : these results are based on less - reliable emission - line radial velocities and assume specific lower bounds on the masses of the secondary stars .",
    "nearly all transient black hole sources , which are fed by roche - lobe overflow , exhibit long periods of deep quiescence during which the spectra of their secondary stars are prominent . for all eight of these long - period systems ( @xmath15  d )",
    "there is strong evidence that the masses of their black hole primaries exceed @xmath16 .",
    "we comment on the two weakest cases .",
    "( 1 ) gx 339 - 4 has never reached a deep enough quiescent state to reveal its photospheric absorption lines , and its mass function was determined via the bowen emission lines ( hynes et al .",
    "2003 ) . furthermore",
    ", this system does not exhibit ellipsoidal light curves that allow its inclination to be constrained . for a defense of the @xmath17 lower limit",
    "see munoz - darias et al .",
    "( 2 ) grs 1915 + 105 : the pioneering mass measurement of this system by greiner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) requires confirmation .",
    "their spectroscopic orbital period disagrees by 8% with a more recent photometric determination of the period ( neil et al .",
    "again , there are no well - behaved ellipsoidal light curves that can be used to constrain the inclination , which in this case is inferred from a kinematic model of the relativistic radio jets ( mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) .",
    "significant constraints have been placed on the black hole primaries of only three of the nine short period systems ( @xmath18  d ) .",
    "it is difficult to obtain reliable inclination constraints for these systems because studies in quiescence of their small , late - type secondaries are compromised by the presence of a relatively strong and variable component of non - stellar light ( e.g. , zurita et al .  2003 ; cantrell et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is continually present in all of these systems .",
    "a measurement of the inclination angle has been obtained only for a062000 , the prototype system , which is two magnitudes brighter than the other short period transients .",
    "the study by cantrell et al.(2010 ) , a tour de force that makes use of 32 photometric data sets spanning 30 years , relies on 10 data sets obtained when the source was in a `` passive '' quiescent state ( cantrell et al .",
    "as indicated in table 2 , the authors constrain the mass to be @xmath19 .",
    "meanwhile , the masses of three other systems ( xte j1118 + 480 , nova oph 1977 and gs 2000 + 251 ) have by dint of their large mass functions been shown to exceed @xmath16 ( table 2 ) .",
    "the large mass function of xte j1859 + 226 ( table 2 ) suggests that it also should be included in this group ; however , this result is unreliable , having only been presented in an iau circular ( filippenko & silverman 2001 ) , and the orbital period is uncertain ( zurita et al .",
    "we exclude this source from further considerations on deriving the black - hole mass distribution .    among the 23 systems in table 2 , arguably the best candidate for hosting a low - mass black hole is gro j0422 + 32 .",
    "however , by briefly discussing recent attempts to determine the system s inclination and mass , we show that current results are presently unreliable : beekman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) constrained the inclination to lie in the range @xmath20 and concluded @xmath21 .",
    "webb et al.(2000 ) concluded @xmath22 and @xmath23 with a maximum mass that is not constrained .",
    "gelino and harrison ( 2003 ) present the strongest evidence for a low mass ; they conclude @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". however , in a more recent keck @xmath5-band study reynolds et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that `` no clear ellipsoidal modulation is present in the light curve ... '' and concluded , `` ... that previous infrared - based attempts to constrain the mass of the putative black hole in this system are prone to considerable uncertainty . ''",
    "thus , it appears that a far more comprehensive photometric study ( cf .",
    "cantrell et al .",
    "2010 ) is required in order to obtain a firm mass constraint .",
    "there are six systems in table 2 with black holes of indeterminate mass .",
    "the prospects for measuring or usefully constraining the masses of two of them , lmc x-3 and xte j1859 - 226 , are bright : work on the former is almost complete ( j.  orosz , private communication ) , and the additional data required to confirm the orbital period and large mass function of the latter are obtainable . that leaves four systems ( gro j0422 + 32 , grs 100945 , nova mus 1991 and xte j1650500 ) with black hole masses that are only very weakly constrained : @xmath26 . as indicated above and as cantrell et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown , it will be very challenging to place stronger and reliable constraints on the masses of these black holes .",
    "data for 32 x - ray transient systems are given in table  3 .",
    "these systems lack radial velocity data , and most even lack an optical counterpart .",
    "thus , presently , there are no dynamical constraints on the masses of their compact primaries , which are believed to be black holes because they share certain characteristic x - ray properties with the 23 established black holes ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) . as indicated in table 3 , the primary source of information about these systems is the catalogue of liu et al .",

    "in the previous section , we discussed two distinct results we obtained on the mass distribution of stellar black holes using the data on 16 sources in low - mass x - ray binaries : the cut - off mass at the low end is @xmath123 , indicating a significant lack of black holes in the @xmath124 range , and the mass scale in the exponential is @xmath125 , indicating a rapid decline of the distribution at the high - mass end . in other words , the black hole mass distribution is narrow and can also be represented with a gaussian at @xmath0 .",
    "we now explore two questions about our results : _",
    "( i ) _ whether any observational selection effects could have biased the black - hole mass distribution we inferred for transient sources and _ ( ii ) _ whether the black holes in transient low - mass x - ray binaries are a representative sample of the population of stellar black holes in the galaxy .",
    "the masses of stellar black holes have generally been measured when the black holes _ ( i ) _ reside in binary systems , _",
    "( ii ) _ are transient x - ray sources , and _ ( iii ) _ reach peak fluxes above 1  crab ( about @xmath126  erg  s@xmath127  @xmath128 ) during their outbursts .",
    "the first requirement naturally arises from the nature of the dynamical mass measurements .",
    "the second requirement ensures that optical observations of the companion star can be carried out during the quiescent phase so that the radial velocity measurements are not contaminated by the emission from the accretion disk . finally , the third requirement is a common strategy of observing campaigns that aims to select among the transients those sources that are the closest and the least obscured .",
    "black hole transients have been observed in the last four decades with a large collection of x - ray telescopes .",
    "we , therefore , tried to verify and quantify the third requirement for follow - up by compiling the highest flux level observed from each transient black hole or black hole candidate in outburst by any instrument ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : hist ] the histogram of the highest flux levels observed during outburst from the 16 confirmed black holes ( in red ) and from the black hole candidates ( in blue ) .",
    "the dichotomy between the fluxes of the two groups is striking and indeed shows that primarily the brightest sources have been followed up for dynamical mass measurements .",
    "we then explored whether the 1  crab flux threshold during outburst could lead to a selection bias against low - mass black holes .",
    "setting a flux limit for optical follow - ups restricts , in principle , the volume of the galaxy that is sampled .",
    "if , in addition , the low - mass black holes form an intrinsically fainter population than that of more massive black holes , this could indeed introduce a selection bias .",
    "consider , for example , the case in which the maximum luminosity during the outburst of an x - ray transient is proportional to the mass of the black hole , so that the binary systems with low - mass black holes are intrinsically dimmer than their high mass counterparts . because the volume of the disk component of the galaxy scales as the distance squared , the volume sampled by sources selected for follow - up observations scales as the mass of the black hole .",
    "if the mass distribution of black holes was rather flat , then , on average , @xmath129 times more @xmath130 black holes would be followed up than @xmath131 black holes , leading to an artificial reduction in the number of low - mass black holes .",
    "if there were indeed a population of intrinsically fainter , low - mass black holes , for the 16 more massive ones that have been observed , 4 low mass black holes should have been found within the same flux limits according to the previous argument . in contrast , there is none in the current sample .",
    "this fact argues that the lack of low - mass black holes is real .",
    "another way to determine whether the volume - limited sample introduces a mass bias is to compare the number and distribution in the galaxy of secure black hole sources to those of the black hole candidates .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : gal_distr ] the galactic distribution of the black holes with secure mass determinations .",
    "it is evident that these sources lie within @xmath132 of the volume of the galactic disk . as a result ,",
    "if the observed black holes are a representative sample of the true population , our catalogue of black - hole candidates should contain twice as many sources that are fainter simply because they lie further away in the galaxy compared to the 16 sources that have been followed up .",
    "this is precisely the ratio of the number of black - hole candidate sources in table  3 to that of secure black holes in table  1 : 32:16 .",
    "the 16 secure black holes have a median intensity of 3.6  crab and a median distance of @xmath1334  kpc .",
    "the 32 black hole candidates , on the other hand , have a median intensity of 0.18  crab , so we expect them to be on average @xmath134 times farther .",
    "( note , however , that confirmed black holes have benefited from almost continuous monitoring that led to an accurate measurement of their the maximum intensities .",
    "the black hole candidates have been observed more sparsely , so that the maximum reported intensity is in most cases likely to be below the actual maximum intensity that the sources reached ) .",
    "this further supports the idea that the black hole candidates lie in the far two - thirds of the galaxy .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that there is no room within the 32 black - hole candidates to hide any sizable population of sources that are fainter because they are intrinsically less massive .",
    "the fact that our sample of secure black - holes is flux limited does not imply that it is luminosity limited , and , therefore , does not introduce any selection bias against the detection of low - mass black holes .      the sample of 16 sources that we used to infer the mass distribution of stellar black holes has been drawn from transient low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "here , we consider the possibility that low - mass black holes exist , but not in transient low - mass x - ray binaries . in turn",
    ", we will consider the possibility that low - mass black holes are primarily in persistent binaries or that they are not members of binary systems at all .    _",
    "( i ) are accreting low - mass ( @xmath1 ) or high mass ( @xmath135 ) black holes persistent x - ray sources? _ most known neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries are persistent sources , whereas the majority of black hole binaries are transient systems .",
    "( the latter statement is primarily a consequence of the fact that the transient behavior has so far been required in establishing the black hole nature of a compact object in a majority of the sources ) .",
    "is it possible that low - mass black holes behave more like neutron stars than their more massive counterparts ?",
    "the most prominent explanation of the transient behavior of x - ray binaries is the irradiated disk instability model ( van paradijs 1996 ; king , kolb , & burderi 1996 ; dubus et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this model ,",
    "whether an x - ray binary is a transient depends only weakly on the nature of the primary but is mainly determined by the orbital period of the system , the mass of the primary , and the evolutionary state of the companion star ( king et al .",
    "thus , the expectation is that a 4  @xmath116 black hole binary should behave like one containing a 6  @xmath116 black hole if they have comparable orbital periods .",
    "furthermore , our sample of 16 transient black hole sources includes both short - period and long - period systems , indicating that the transient behavior is seen over a range of orbital periods .",
    "we , therefore , find it unlikely , albeit still possible , that low - mass black holes would preferentially exist in persistent binaries if the distribution of their orbital periods is similar to that of the confirmed black holes .",
    "we , nevertheless , explore whether the known number of persistent x - ray sources in the galaxy is large enough to harbor the low - mass back holes if , indeed , all of the latter are persistent systems .",
    "to this end , we analyzed the catalogue of low - mass x - ray binaries by liu , van den heuvel , & van paradijs ( 2007 ) .",
    "starting with the total number of non - pulsing x - ray binaries in the galaxy , we identified the following categories : _ ( a ) _ confirmed black holes , which refer to those with dynamical mass measurements ; _ ( b ) _ black hole candidates , which are sources with no mass determinations , but possess spectra and radio properties that resemble those of the confirmed black holes ; _ ( c ) _ unidentified sources , which are those with significant number of observations but no distinguishing characteristics to reveal the nature of the primary ; _ ( d ) _ neutron stars , which are sources that exhibit thermonuclear x - ray bursts ; and _ ( e ) _",
    "sources for which there is very little information . in table  4",
    ", we show the numbers and relative fractions of sources in these categories .",
    "table  4 indicates that there are a total of 72 known persistent x - ray sources .",
    "46 out of these 72 sources have shown thermonuclear bursts and can securely be identified as neutron stars , leaving at most 26 sources as possible low - mass black hole binaries .",
    "in reality , only two of these remaining 26 sources show evidence for black hole nature , and a further 7 show no thermonuclear bursts even though they have been extensively observed .",
    "we will , nevertheless , allow the possibility that all can harbor low - mass black holes .    for any integrable ( i.e. , declining faster than logarithmic ) distribution of black hole masses that does not have a low - mass gap , there should be more black holes with masses in the @xmath136 range than with masses @xmath137 .",
    "if all the 26 persistent sourcse were low - mass black holes , we would expect this number to be larger than the total number of transient ( higher mass ) black hole sources in the galaxy . from the galactic distribution of transient black - hole binaries",
    ", we estimated ( see previous subsection ) that there are at least three times as many black holes in the galaxy with masses @xmath137 than our current sample of 16 . taking into account the short duty cycles of transient black - hole binaries",
    ", we can safely infer that the total number of such systems in the galaxy is @xmath138 , which is significantly larger than 26 . as a result ,",
    "even if all the 26 non - bursting sources were low - mass black holes , they would not be enough to efficiently close the low - mass gap between @xmath139 and @xmath121 in the inferred distribution .",
    "nevertheless , applying the dynamical bowen technique to persistent low - mass x - ray binaries will help explore further this possibility .    _",
    "( ii ) are low - mass ( @xmath1 ) or high mass ( @xmath140 ) black holes not members of x - ray binary systems? _ the fraction of binaries that survive the supernova explosion is determined by a number of factors , such as the orbital separation , the amount of mass loss and the kick velocity during the supernova explosion .",
    "these factors depend on the progenitor and the remnant masses and may work in a way to hinder the formation of low - mass x - ray binaries with low- or high - mass black holes .",
    "moreover , even if the binaries survive the explosions , systems with low- or high - mass remnants may become wider and perhaps never reach contact .",
    "it appears unlikely that this is the explanation of the paucity of low - mass black holes between the systems with dynamical mass measurements ( see fryer & kalogera 2001 ) , although addressing this question would only be possible through detailed population synthesis calculations .    on the other hand , the particular evolutionary path that leads to the formation of black - hole x - ray binaries might be responsible for the lack of systems with relatively massive black holes ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "mass transfer in the low - mass x - ray binary phase requires small orbital separations between the black hole and the low - mass companion .",
    "the common envelope phase , which is invoked to reduce sufficiently the orbital separation of the binary before the supernova , is thought to lead to the expulsion of the hydrogen envelope of the pre - supernova star , leaving behind a bare helium core .",
    "furthermore , the winds from the resulting helium cores in a wolf - rayet phase are expected to lead to further mass loss , albeit at rates that are highly uncertain . as a result , it is possible that the black hole masses in contact binaries are capped at @xmath142 , although this value depends strongly on the assumed mass loss rates ( woosley , heger , & weaver 2002 ) .",
    "this evolutionary path could provide a natural explanation for the rapid decline of the inferred mass function at the high - mass end . the same mechanism does not necessarily cap the mass of the black holes in high - mass x - ray binaries , which are wind - fed .",
    "we now explore the implications of the narrow mass distribution of black holes in low - mass x - ray binaries for the progenitors of these systems and the supernovae that form the black holes .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , the rapid decline at the high mass end of the inferred distribution is plausibly the result of the particular binary formation channel that leads to low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "in contrast to this population , relatively more massive black holes ( @xmath143 ) have been detected in high mass x - ray binaries ( see the persistent sources in table  2 ) .",
    "this argues that there is no intrinsic barrier for the formation of massive black holes as the end stages of stellar evolution but that the differences between the black hole masses in the two binary populations are due to the different evolutionary paths that they follow .",
    "observational studies of mass loss from stars with hydrogen and helium envelopes , in isolation and in tight binary systems , will elucidate and test these ideas .",
    "the low - mass gap , on the other hand , can not be accounted for by observational selection effects ( even though the mass measurement method requires a particular choice of targets and the observing strategy has resulted in a flux - limited sample ) .",
    "it is also unlikely that it results from the particular evolutionary paths of low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "therefore , it appears to be real .",
    "the observed distribution of masses could be different than the distribution of birth masses because mass transfer in the x - ray binary phase could have caused the black holes to evolve away from the masses they were born with .",
    "population synthesis models ( e.g. , fragos et al.2010 ) show , however , that the least massive black holes are preferentially born with low - mass companions ( @xmath144 ) and , therefore , could not accrete a significant amount of matter over the lifetime of the binary . when the companions are more massive than 5  @xmath116 at the start of the mass transfer phase , the black holes are born with masses that are also @xmath123 . as a result ,",
    "the accretion in the binary phase is not likely to bridge the gap between 2 and 5  @xmath116 .",
    "it has been suggested that black hole evaporation in braneworld gravity models can lead to a deficiency of low - mass black holes in the steady state population .",
    "a gap could be created in this context because the rate of evaporation in braneworld gravity is very rapid and increases with decreasing black hole mass ( postnov & cherepashchuk 2003 ) .",
    "however , recent constraints on the rate of evaporation obtained using the current population of black holes preclude this possibility ( johannsen , psaltis , & mcclintock 2009 ) .",
    "the paucity of black holes with masses less than @xmath145 are likely , therefore , to be related to the physics of supernova explosions that lead to the formation of black holes .",
    "numerical simulations of supernova explosions typically generate a continuous distribution of black hole masses that decays as an exponential ( fryer 1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "the continuity of masses is primarily a consequence of the relatively gradual dependence of explosion energies on the masses of the progenitors and the fact that explosion energies are still comparable to ( although smaller than ) the binding energy of the stellar envelopes .",
    "although creating a mass gap is difficult given the current understanding of the supernova energetics , it has been suggested that it can be achieved under the ad hoc assumption that the explosion energy has a step - function dependence on progenitor mass and that it plunges to zero for stars more massive than @xmath146 ( fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "such a bimodality in the energies of explosions that form neutron stars versus black holes should become apparent in the large sample of supernovae anticipated from the ongoing surveys that are sensitive to underluminous core - collapse supernovae .",
