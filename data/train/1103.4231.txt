    "recent experiments on ultracold gases in optical potentials @xcite and experiments on photons in microwave cavities @xcite have demonstrated that it is possible to prepare a fock state as a pure state in a finite - dimensional system . after the preparation of the fock state ,",
    "the parameters of the system can suddenly be changed ( performing a `` quench '' ) such that the fock state is not an eigenstate of the new system hamiltonian @xmath0",
    ". then the evolution of the many - body state due to the evolution operator @xmath1 will lead to a random walk inside the available hilbert space .",
    "the visited states include other fock states as well as superpositions of fock states .",
    "typical questions in this context are : what is the probability for visiting different states and how is this affected by the interaction of the particles ?",
    "a natural quantity for measuring this probability is the spectral density function of the hamiltonian @xmath0 with respect to the initial fock state @xcite .",
    "a classical candidate for modeling the evolution of a fock state is the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the corresponding discrete hamiltonian describes the tunneling of a particle between neighboring potential wells and a local particle - particle interaction . the hubbard model for bosons ( bose - hubbard model )",
    "was realized as an atomic system in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "a possible realization of the bose - hubbard model by photons in coupled microwave cavities was proposed recently by hartmann et al .",
    "an anharmonicity of the microwave cavities plays the role of the photon - photon interaction @xcite .",
    "the simplest system for discussing the evolution of a fock state within the hubbard model is a double well , where particles can tunnel between the two wells . for @xmath2 bosons the underlying hilbert space is spanned by the @xmath3dimensional fock base @xmath4 , where @xmath5 bosons are in one well and @xmath6 in the other well @xcite . the initial state is prepared as a fock state , where all the bosons are in one of the two wells ( i.e. @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) , while the tunneling between the wells is turned off . to start the evolution , a `` quench ''",
    "is provided by switching on the tunneling between the two wells .",
    "this is realized by a sudden reduction the potential barrier between the wells in an atomic system @xcite or by connecting the two microwave cavities with an optical fiber @xcite .",
    "a similar experiment was performed with two atomic clouds , subject to weak interaction and separated by an adjustable potential barrier @xcite .    on the theoretical side , mean - field descriptions of the bose - hubbard model , such as a hartree approximation or the gross - pitaevskii equation , may work well for clouds with many bosons and weak boson - boson interaction @xcite .",
    "they provide a rather poor approximation for the dynamics of small many - body systems ( cf . ref .",
    "this was also observed in a recent study by streltsov et al . who compared the results of a simple hartree ( gross - pitaevskii ) approximation with a sophisticated multi - orbital hartree approximation @xcite .",

    "this indicates that the off - diagonal part has overlaps with energy levels which are different from those of the diagonal part @xmath36 . for the evolution",
    "only the latter contribute substantially , preventing the system to create a n00n state .",
    "in order to understand the evolution of an isolated many - body bosonic system , we start with noninteracting bosons ( i.e. @xmath42 ) of sect . [ sect : double_well_non ] .",

    "the evolution of a fock state is characterized by a periodic behavior with a single frequency @xmath84 as a direct consequence of the equidistant energy levels .",
    "the amplitudes for visiting the initial fock state @xmath8 or the complimentary fock state @xmath7 vary with @xmath85 or @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "this implies for a large number @xmath2 of bosons that ( i ) these states are visited only for a very short period of time and ( ii ) the two fock states are visited at different times .",
    "thus the formation of a n00n state is very unlikely for noninteracting bosons .",
    "a simple qualitative picture for the general evolution of the fock state is the random walk in hilbert space . in case of noninteracting bosons",

    "a simultaneous overlap of @xmath87 with both fock states @xmath8 and @xmath7 is very unlikely then .",
    "once we have turned on the boson - boson interaction the particles experience a mutual influence which restricts their individual random walks .",
    "this is related to the fact that the systems stays much longer in the energetically ( almost ) degenerate fock states @xmath8 and @xmath7 than in the noninteracting case ( cf .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) and , what is even more important here , they can have a simultaneous overlap with both fock states , such that they create a n00n state . in terms of the spectral properties the interaction modifies ( i ) the energy levels , which are not equally spaced , and ( ii ) the weight distribution of the levels , which are not binomial any longer ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig:1]-[fig:6 ] ) .",
    "this , of course , affects also the evolution of the fock state which is more complex now , since many different frequencies are involved .",
    "a particular feature is the spectral fragmentation ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , where only a part of the spectrum contributes to the off - diagonal coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "this is a kind of hilbert - space localization , where transitions to the high - energy part of the hilbert space are completely suppressed , similar to the self - trapping found in the hartree approximation of the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that spectral fragmentation appears at a much weaker interaction strength than the self - trapping effect . for @xmath88 , which is the threshold for self - trapping @xcite ,",
    "there is only one eigenvalue with significant weight @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "thus it is not clear whether or not the two effects are directly are connected .    for the asymmetric double",
    "well the situation is different due to the existence of two `` bands '' and the absence of the double degeneracy .",
    "the main consequence is the absence of a support for the formation of n00n states because the off - diagonal coefficient @xmath35 is strongly suppressed . from this observation",
    "we can conclude that the evolutionary entanglement is much more favorable in the symmetric double well .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the multi - orbital hartree calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the evolution of a bosonic fock state @xmath8 in a double well and found that a local particle - particle interaction supports the formation of a n00n state , provided that the interaction is not too strong .",
    "this is accompanied by a fragmentation of the spectrum .",
    "the latter is characterized by the fact that only eigenstates with energies less than the energy of the initial fock state can be reached in the evolution .",
    "this interaction effect causes a hilbert - space localization and prevents the evolution of the fock state to disappear in the depth of the hilbert space .",
    "this is the main reason for a favorable creation of a n00n state .",
    "the appearance of a n00n state is suppressed though for strong interaction because then the restriction of the hilbert space is too severe and does not allow to reach the complementary fock state @xmath7 .",
