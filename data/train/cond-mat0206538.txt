    "over the last years much attention has been concentrated on the physics of low - dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "in particular , zero - temperature phase transitions and exotic magnetization curves in frustrated quantum magnets are in the focus of investigations .",
    "besides continuous quantum phase - transitions also remarkable first - order transitions can be driven by frustration .",
    "the theoretical studies have benefitted from recent experimental results on low - dimensional spin - half antiferromagnets like quasi - onedimensional ladder , zigzag and spin - peierls systems as well as gapped quasi - twodimensional quantum magnets like @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite .    among the various models for low - dimensional quantum magnets",
    "the spin - half frustrated dimer - plaquette chain ( fdpc ) has been discussed in a series of papers in recent years .",
    "this fdpc was introduced in @xcite and its hamiltonian reads ( see also fig . [ fig1 ] ) @xmath2    = 1.25 mm    where @xmath3 is the number of plaquettes ( unit cells ) and @xmath4 is the number of spins .",
    "we consider finite chains of @xmath4 spins with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian fulfills the important relation @xmath5_-=0 $ ] .",
    "hence the vertical dimer spins @xmath6 and @xmath7 form a composite spin @xmath8 with eigenvalues @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the physics of this model was discussed in the literature for antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath11 @xcite .    in the unfrustrated version ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) the model may serve as the onedimensional counterpart of the 1/5-depleted square lattice of @xmath0 @xcite . in this case ( @xmath12 ) all composite spins have eigenvalues @xmath14 in the singlet ground state as well as in the first triplet excitation and the ground - state physics of ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "is determined by the competition of dimer ( @xmath15 ) and plaquette ( @xmath16 ) bonds . in the limit @xmath17",
    "the low - energy physics of the model is that of the haldane chain with an effective coupling @xmath18 , whereas for @xmath19 a plaquette phase is realized @xcite . the singlet - triplet excitation gap is always finite for @xmath20 .",
    "a special feature of the model is the existence of a class of exact product eigenstates , for which the composite spins of certain plaquettes form a vertical dimer singlet ( i.e. @xmath21 for certain @xmath22 ) .",
    "the finite strips ( fragments ) between two vertical dimer singlets contain vertical dimer triplets @xmath23 and are decoupled from each other .",
    "therefore these product eigenstates correspond to a fragmentation of the chain .",
    "taking into account frustration @xmath24 the formation of vertical dimer singlets becomes energetically more favourable and the system undergoes at a critical frustration @xmath25 a first - order quantum phase transition from the collective ground state with @xmath26 for all @xmath22 to a fragmented dimer product ground state @xmath27 with @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath28 the dimer state @xmath29 ) is a singlet and the energy of @xmath30 is @xmath31 .    in the special limit @xmath32",
    "the critical value is @xmath33 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the fdpc has a close relation to the two - dimensional spin model for srcu@xmath34(bo@xmath35)@xmath34 @xcite and is called orthogonal - dimer chain .",
    "similar to the quasi - twodimensional spin system srcu@xmath34(bo@xmath35)@xmath34 @xcite the fdpc exhibits nontrivial magnetization plateaus @xcite .",
    "a novel property of the fdpc , not found so far in quantum spin systems , is the existence of an infinite sequence of plateaus @xcite .",
    "very recently , the fdpc has been considered for arbitrary spin quantum numbers @xmath36 and a series of @xmath37 first - order quantum phase transitions has been found by koga and kawakami @xcite .",
    "koga and coworkers argue that the first - order phase transitions described by the fdpc possess most of the essential features inherent in frustrated quantum spin systems @xcite . in that sense",
    "the fdpc may serve as a prototype model for spin sytems showing first - order quantum phase transitions .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the model to ferromagnetic bonds @xmath15 .",
    "we notice , that the fragmentation of the chain due to vertical dimer singlets occurs for @xmath38 , too . in particular",
    ", the dimer product state ( [ eq2 ] ) is an eigenstate of ( [ eq1 ] ) also for @xmath39 , however , the dimer state @xmath29 in @xmath30 is a triplet .",
    "the energy of @xmath30 is then @xmath40 .",
    "we start from the energy eigenvalues @xmath41 of model ( [ eq1 ] ) and write the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath42 in explicit form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of vertical dimers with composite spin @xmath21 and @xmath45 is the number of vertical dimers with composite spin @xmath26 .",
    "we have @xmath46 . since every vertical dimer singlet leads to an energy gain of @xmath42 in the second part of the energy the frustration favours states with @xmath47 , i.e. a fragmentation of the chain .",
    "the lowest state of these finite fragments has a total spin @xmath48 for @xmath39 .",
    "we define the length @xmath49 of a fragment , as the number of triplet composite spins @xmath26 between two singlet composite spins .    according to the so - called linear programming scheme",
    "the extrema of the energy belong to states with fragments of identical length @xmath49 @xcite . in what follows we use the notation @xmath50 for a fragmented state consisting of identical fragments of length @xmath49 .",
    "the dimer product state ( [ eq2 ] ) corresponds to fragments of length @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "it is evident that the system undergoes at least one transition from the nonfragmented ground state @xmath53 with @xmath26 ( @xmath54 ) at small @xmath42 to the dimer product ground state @xmath55 with @xmath21 ( @xmath54 ) for large @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "[ dp_frag ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , for antiferromagnetic @xmath15 indeed we have a direct transition @xmath56 .",
    "however , for ferromagnetic @xmath15 the question for the existence of intermediate ground states @xmath50 with fragments of finite length @xmath57 needs more attention .",
    "we start from the ground state @xmath53 for low frustration .",
    "the energy per unit cell of this state is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy of the ground state for the unfrustrated chain ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we determine @xmath59 by finite - size extrapolation of chains of length @xmath60 as well as perturbation theory .",
    "the energy per unit cell @xmath61 of a fragmented state @xmath62 is given by the sum of the energies @xmath63 of the fragments and of the energies @xmath64 of the singlets separating the fragments @xmath65 @xmath66 is the energy of the unfrustrated ( @xmath12 ) fragment of length @xmath49 consisting of @xmath49 plaquettes and @xmath67 dimer bonds @xmath15 and corresponds to the energy of a finite dimer - plaquette chain with @xmath68 spins and open boundary conditions .",
    "using lanczos algorithm we can exactly caculate the energy of the chain fragments @xmath66 up to @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 ) . for larger fragment lengths and for the state @xmath53",
    "we need approximations . in the limits",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 perturbation theory is appropriate since for @xmath73 and @xmath74 the ground states are known as simple product states .",
    "we use here rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory up to 3rd order .",
    "the comparison of perturbation theory with lanczos results shows that the perturbation theory yields reliable results even for @xmath75 .",
    "[ dpejf ] shows the lowest energies of the state @xmath50 with @xmath76 und @xmath77 versus @xmath42 for several @xmath15 .",
    "the intersection points of the lowest lines determine the positions of first - order quantum phase transitions .",
    "it becomes obvious that the number of phase transitions changes from one to four increasing the strength of ferromagnetic @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of further transitions can be excluded by analyzing the @xmath49-dependence of @xmath66 according to niggemann et al . @xcite .",
    "the transition point @xmath78 between two ground - state phases @xmath79 and @xmath80 are obtained by the relation @xmath81 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) we find @xmath82 the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ dpfmphase ] .    for completeness and comparison",
    "we have reconsidered the case of antiferromagnetic @xmath15 @xcite including perturbation theory and an enlarged exact - diagonalization data set , see fig .",
    "[ dpafphase ] . for small strength of dimer coupling @xmath83",
    "the situation is similar for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic @xmath15 , i.e. we have a direct transition @xmath56 . increasing the strength of ferromagnetic dimer coupling to @xmath84 the situation",
    "is changed and we find an additional intermediate phase @xmath85 . further increasing @xmath86",
    "we find another intermediate phase @xmath87 , and finally we have a sequence of transitions @xmath88 at very strong ferromagnetic @xmath15 . in this extreme limit @xmath89",
    "the fdpc can be mapped onto the frustrated diamond chain and our results are in agreement with the results reported in ref .",
    "as discussed in refs . @xcite the fdpc with antiferromagnetic @xmath15 exhibits nontrivial magnetization plateaus .",
    "therefore we consider now the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) including an external magnetic field @xmath90 where the z - component of the total spin is given by @xmath91 .",
    "for ferromagnetic @xmath15 we have a more complex zero - field ground - state phase diagram and we can expect interesting effects caused by a magnetic field .    one important difference to the antiferromagnetic case @xmath92 consists in the circumstance , that for ferromagnetic @xmath15 any fragment of length @xmath49 carries a finite total spin @xmath48 in its lowest state for @xmath93 , whereas the total spin @xmath94 for @xmath92 is zero for even @xmath49 .",
    "hence the fragmentation is favoured by the magnetic field , whereby short fragments are more favourable than long fragments .",
    "as discussed already above , the extrema of the energy belong to states with fragments of identical length @xmath49 . for @xmath95 in zero field the fragmented state @xmath50 ( @xmath49 finite ) can carry total spin @xmath96 . from the numerical inspection of the excitation spectrum of finite fragments",
    "we argue that their excited states with @xmath97 are well separated from the lowest state with @xmath48 .",
    "hence we can expect for parameter points in the zero - field phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ dpfmphase ] ) not too far from a transition line that the first - order transitions can also be driven by an external magnetic field .",
    "to be more precise we have studied the ground - state phases of a fdpc in a magnetic field with @xmath98 sites in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_h ] .",
    "we mention , that for this chain length the fragmented state @xmath87 does not fit to the periodic boundary conditions and is therefore missing .",
    "( a finite - size calculation including all zero - field ground - state phases would require @xmath99 sites which is currently beyond the available computer facilities . ) we argue that except for missing the @xmath87 phase the other ground - state phases should be well described by the @xmath98 system , since the correlation length in all phases is rather small . in particular , the transition lines between @xmath100 and @xmath101 and between @xmath101 and @xmath102 presented in fig .",
    "[ phase_h ] are exact , since these ground - state phases belong to product states correctly described for @xmath98 .",
    "similar to the zero - field phase diagram there is no fragmentation for small frustration .",
    "however , supported by the field the fragmention sets in already at @xmath103 for @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 for @xmath106 . in general , the phase transitions shown in fig .",
    "[ dpfmphase ] are shifted to lower values of frustration @xmath42 .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram in finite magnetic field leads to interesting magnetization curves ( fig .",
    "[ m_h ] ) .",
    "we define the magnetization as @xmath107 , @xmath108 is zero in a singlet state but unity in the fully polarized ferromagnetic state .",
    "then the fragmented ground - state phases @xmath53 , @xmath109 , @xmath87 , @xmath85 , @xmath55 in fig",
    ". [ dpfmphase ] correspond to @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .    for small @xmath113",
    "we have a magnetization curve @xmath114 typical for    unfrustrated gapped spin systems , like the haldane chain @xcite .",
    "due to the gap the curve starts with a plateau at zero field but then it goes continuously to saturation . for the finite system considered the continuous part is staircase like with small steps ( see thin solid line in fig .",
    "[ m_h ] ) which is related to the corresponding line of a @xmath115 haldane chain .",
    "for comparison we added the dmrg data for the haldane chain of 60 sites ( see thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ m_h ] ) taken from @xcite . for intermediate frustration @xmath116 we have jumps , plateaus and continuous parts in the @xmath114 curve .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath117 we have no continuous parts in the curve , but only plateaus connected by jumps .",
    "for instance , for @xmath118 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ m_h ] ) we have the same sequence of phase transitions as in fig .",
    "[ dpfmphase ] , but now driven by increasing the magnetic field from @xmath106 to @xmath119 . as a result the magnetization @xmath108 jumps from @xmath110 to @xmath111 to @xmath112 to @xmath100 to @xmath101 and further increasing @xmath120 to saturation @xmath102 ( notice that @xmath112 is missing for @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ m_h ] ) . for large frustration @xmath121",
    "we have an extreme @xmath114 curve consisting only of one plateau at @xmath101 followed by a jump to saturation @xmath102 .",
    "we remark , that the jump to the saturation @xmath102 present for @xmath122 is related to independent magnon excitations versus the fully polarized ferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "we notice , that our result is in accordance with the general rule of oshikawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that @xmath123 has to be an integer . in our case",
    "the period @xmath22 of a fragmented ground state @xmath50 is @xmath124 , the spin @xmath125 is one half and the magnetization per site @xmath126 is @xmath127 ( the magnetization per site @xmath128 corresponds to one half of the magnetization @xmath108 used so far ) .",
    "in this section we discuss some consequences of the ground - state phase diagram on the low - temperature thermodynamics .",
    "the different nature of the nonfragmented phase @xmath53 and the fragmented phases @xmath50 ( @xmath49 finite ) has an important impact on thermodynamics . while the the ground state @xmath129 is a singlet with gapped triplet excitations , the fragmented ground states @xmath62 consist of independent paramagnetic entities . as a consequence , in the former case both the susceptibility @xmath130 and",
    "the specific heat @xmath131 are thermally activated and decay exponentially to zero if temperature @xmath132 goes to zero . on the other hand , for a fragmented ground state",
    "the susceptibility shows a paramagnetic curie like divergency for @xmath133 .",
    "hence , varying @xmath42 the low - temperature behaviour of @xmath130 changes basically crossing the transition line between @xmath129 and @xmath134 .",
    "the behaviour for the specific heat near the phase boundaries can be more complex , since close to these boundaries we have quasi - degenerated low - lying levels which may lead to additional low - temperature peaks in @xmath131 .    to illustrate this behaviour we present in fig .",

    "[ chi_t ] between @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the same parameter region",
    "the specific heat shows a characteristic double - peak structure due to the quasi - degeneracy of states near the transition line .",
    "this effect should survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in conclusion , we have found a series of first - order quantum phase transitions in a frustrated one - dimensional quantum spin system which is closely related to the possibility of fragmentation of the considered chain .",
    "this series of phase transitions can be driven either by frustration or by a magnetic field .",
    "we emphasize that this fragmentation and the related consequences for physical properties are pure quantum effects not present in classical spin systems .",
    "the existence of different ground states has a strong impact on the magnetization curve and the low - temperature thermodynamics of the spin system . in dependence on the frustration the magnetization curve shows plateaus , jumps as well as continuous parts .",
    "though the possibility of fragmentation has been observed also for frustrated two - leg spin ladder @xcite , in the spin ladder system only very simple ground states seem to be relevant for its magnetization curve .",
    "the low - temperature thermodynamics can be either spin - gap like for small frustration or paramagnetic for large frustration .",
