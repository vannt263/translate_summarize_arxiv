    "since its discovery in 1974 , the @xmath1 meson has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath4 , from long - distance matrix elements ( me s ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules , _",
    "i.e. _ the me s are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath5 ) velocity @xmath6 in the limit @xmath7 . in this way ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath8 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath9 with definite spin @xmath10 , orbital angular momentum @xmath11 , total angular momentum @xmath12 , and colour multiplicity @xmath13 , @xmath14 . in particular",
    ", this formalism predicts the existence of colour - octet processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath8 pairs are produced at short distances in colour - octet states and subsequently evolve into physical ( colour - singlet ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe the cross section of inclusive charmonium hadroproduction measured in @xmath15 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the theoretical prediction based on the traditional colour - singlet model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "the _ experimentum crucis _ of the nrqcd factorization formalism is the measurement of the polarization of charmonium with quantum numbers @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons , in direct hadroproduction , which is predicted to be fully transverse at sufficiently large values of the transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) @xcite . a convenient measure of the polarization is provided by the variable @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the transverse and longitudinal components of the total cross section @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the unpolarized case is characterized by @xmath22 , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to fully transverse and longitudinal polarizations , respectively . as for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons ,",
    "@xmath25 is best measured by analyzing the angular distributions of their decays to @xmath26 pairs , which are proportional to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angle between the @xmath29 direction in the charmonium rest frame and the charmonium direction in the laboratory frame . the first such measurement was recently performed for @xmath3 mesons by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics are still too low to allow for a meaningful test of the nrqcd prediction @xcite . in the same experiment ,",
    "the polarization was also measured for prompt @xmath1 mesons , _",
    "i.e. _ those which do not stem from the decays of bottom - flavored hadrons , with about a hundred times more statistics .",
    "this makes it necessary to include in the theoretical prediction the production of polarized @xmath1 mesons via the decays of the heavier charmonium states @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath3 , which are directly produced .",
    "in fact , these feed - down channels make up approximately 15% , 15% , and 10% of the prompt-@xmath1 signal , respectively .",
    "there is an additional , yet smaller contribution to prompt @xmath1 production from the double - cascade decays of directly produced @xmath3 mesons via @xmath0 intermediate states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide analytic results for the missing ingredients which are necessary to make quantitative predictions for all these contributions .",
    "the resulting prediction for @xmath25 has already been presented in ref .",
    "it is consistent with the cdf data at intermediate values of @xmath17 , but it disagrees by about three standard deviations from the data point of largest @xmath17 .    in order to predict @xmath25 for prompt @xmath1 mesons to lowest order ( lo ) in the nrqcd factorization formalism , we need the polarized cross sections for the partonic subprocesses @xmath32 , where @xmath33 with @xmath34 , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding results for the unpolarized case are well established @xcite .",
    "the polarized cross sections may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the exception of those for the @xmath38-wave colour - singlet @xmath39 fock states @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are relevant for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons . these missing results could have already been obtained in the csm , before the advent of the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "however , the calculation is somewhat tedious , especially for the spin - two case of @xmath31 .",
    "the calculation is further complicated by the fact that @xmath25 is measured in the hadronic center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , so that one can not benefit from the usual simplifications which occur when one chooses the partonic cm frame . instead ,",
    "the cross section does not only depend on the partonic mandelstam variables , but also on the boost factor relating the partonic and hadronic cm frames .",
    "therefore , the helicity amplitude method , which provides a powerful tool for the treatment of complicated partonic subprocesses , such as @xmath42 without polarization , can not be directly employed . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a lorentz - covariant formalism for describing the polarization of massive spin - one particles in the hadronic cm frame was elaborated .",
    "we adopt this formalism and extend it to the spin - two case .",
    "furthermore , we need the probabilities for the transitions from the @xmath39 fock states of the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath3 mesons to those of the @xmath1 meson in the presence of polarization . owing to heavy - quark spin symmetry , they are trivial for the single - cascade decay of the @xmath3 meson . the results for the @xmath43 and @xmath41 channels may be found in ref .",

    "the partonic cross sections for the production of massive spin - one and spin - two bosons , the polarizations of which are to be measured in the hadronic cm frame , depend not only on the partonic mandelstam variables , but also on the boost factor relating the partonic and hadronic cm frames . a lorentz - covariant formalism to deal with this problem in the spin - one case",
