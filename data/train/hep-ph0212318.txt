    "0 during the last few years the interest into theoretical investigations of the quark - gluon structure of light mesons , especially the pion , @xmath9 and @xmath1 mesons , has risen due to the high - precision cleo results on the electromagnetic @xmath10 transition form factors ( ff s ) @xmath11 @xcite ( with @xmath12 denoting one of these mesons ) , as well as because of the observed very large branching ratios for the exclusive @xmath13 and semi - inclusive @xmath14 decays @xcite .    the data on the @xmath15 transition ff were mainly used for extracting information concerning the @xmath1 quark component of the meson distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "schemes and methods applied to this purpose range from light - cone perturbation - theory calculations  with the quark transverse - momentum @xmath16 dependence kept in the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath17 of the underlying hard subprocess @xcite  to the modified hard - scattering approach ( mhsa ) with resummed transverse - momentum effects ( giving rise to sudakov suppression factors ) and such due to the intrinsic transverse momentum of the meson wave functions @xcite , to the running coupling ( rc ) method , employed for the estimation of power - suppressed corrections to the @xmath15 transition ff @xcite . in these investigations , two different parameterizations were used , one employing the conventional @xmath18 mixing scheme with one mixing angle @xmath19 @xcite for both physical states and decay constants and a second one , which considers two mixing angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 to parameterize the weak decay constants @xmath22 @xmath23 of the @xmath9 and @xmath1 mesons @xcite . an important conclusion drawn from these investigations , irrespective of the underlying method ,",
    "is that the @xmath1-meson da must be close to its asymptotic form and that the admixture of the first non - asymptotic term should be within the range @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the first gegenbauer coefficient .",
    "the cleo data on the @xmath15 transition and the two - angles mixing scheme were also used to estimate the allowed range of the intrinsic charm content of the @xmath1 meson decay constant @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the value @xmath27@xmath28 does not contradict the cleo data .",
    "but apart from the ordinary light quark and charm @xmath29 components , the @xmath1 meson may also contain a two - gluon valence fock state @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , absent at the normalization point @xmath31 , a gluon component of the @xmath1 meson will appear in the region @xmath32 owing to quark - gluon mixing and renormalization - group evolution of the @xmath1 meson da @xcite .",
    "this can directly contribute to the @xmath15 transition at the next - to - leading order due to quark box diagrams and also affect the leading - order result through evolution of the quark component of the @xmath1-meson da .",
    "hence , an effect of the @xmath1-meson gluon component on the @xmath15 transition is only mild and was therefore neglected in most theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "but the contribution of the gluon content of the @xmath1 meson to the two - body non - leptonic exclusive and semi - inclusive decay ratios of the @xmath33 meson may be sizeable .",
    "indeed , such a mechanism to account for the observed large branching ratio @xcite @xmath34 was proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this work",
    "it was suggested that the dominant fraction of the @xmath35 decay rate appears as the result of the transition @xmath36 of a virtual gluon @xmath37 from the standard model penguin diagram @xmath38 . for the computation of the contribution of this mechanism to the @xmath39 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath40 vertex function was approximated by the constant @xmath41 , the latter being extracted from the analysis of the @xmath42 decay .",
    "further investigations , however , demonstrated that effects of the qcd running coupling @xmath43 @xcite , as well as a momentum dependence of the form factor @xmath44 , properly taken into account , considerably reduce the contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) of the mechanism under consideration @xcite . in order to cover the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite , a gluon fusion ( spectator ) mechanism was proposed . in accordance with the latter ,",
    "the @xmath1 meson is produced by the fusion of a gluon from the qcd penguin diagram @xmath38 with another one emitted by the light quark inside the @xmath33 meson . in this mechanism",
    ", the form factor @xmath45 appears owing to the @xmath46 transition .",
    "the same ideas form a basis for the computation of the branching ratios of various two - body non - leptonic exclusive decay modes of the @xmath33 meson @xcite . to account for the data on the exclusive decay @xmath13 in ref .",
    "@xcite , a mechanism was proposed , based on the assumption of a strong intrinsic charm component of the @xmath1 meson . but a more detailed analysis @xcite proved that the charm content of the @xmath1 is too small ( @xmath47 ) to explain the observed branching ratio @xmath48 .",
    "the cleo data on the @xmath33 meson non - leptonic decays that stimulated interesting theoretical works @xcite remain actual until today @xcite .",
    "the exclusive processes @xmath49 were also analyzed within the qcd factorization approach @xcite and various contributions to the corresponding branching ratios were estimated @xcite . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectator mechanism and such connected to the gluon content of the @xmath9 and @xmath1 mesons are not a key factor in explaining the pattern of the observed experimental data .",
    "instead , a more important role plays here the interference ( constructive or destructive ) of penguin amplitudes and large radiative corrections to them , which bring the predicted branching ratios into reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "the @xmath1-meson virtual-(on - shell-)gluon transition form factor @xmath50 is the central ingredient of analyses performed within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and hence requires further thorough investigations .",
    "such theoretical investigations are especially important in view of contradictory predictions made for this ff in the literature @xcite . for instance , in ref .  @xcite the contribution of the gluon content of the @xmath1 meson to the form factor @xmath51 was estimated and found to be too small while @xmath51 itself is close to the form @xmath52 used in some phenomenological applications @xcite . on the other hand , in computations of the @xmath1-meson virtual - gluon vertex function @xmath50 , the gluon content of the @xmath1 meson was neglected and the asymptotic form of the da for the quark component was employed @xcite .",
    "the same vertex function @xmath50 was considered in @xcite , where both the standard hsa @xcite as well as the mhsa were used , and the space- , and time - like vertex functions were analyzed .",
    "some errors made in ref .",
    "@xcite in the description of the hard - scattering amplitude of the subprocess @xmath53 and in the definition of the evolution of the @xmath1 meson da were corrected in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , also this latter work contains an incorrect expression for the gluon component @xmath54 of the form factor , since it is antisymmetric under the exchange of the asymmetry parameter @xmath55 in clear conflict with bose symmetry .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the space - like form factor @xmath56 was computed within the standard hsa .",
    "these authors performed a detailed analysis of the normalization of the gluon component of both the @xmath1-meson da and that of the gluon projector onto a pseudoscalar meson state .",
    "in the present work , we investigate the massless @xmath1-meson virtual - gluon space - like transition form factor @xmath56 using the framework of the standard hsa @xcite , as well as by applying the rc method together with the infrared ( ir ) renormalon calculus @xcite .",
    "our results obtained within the standard hsa are in agreement with those of ref .",
    "but our central task here is the calculation and evolution of power - suppressed corrections @xmath57 to the transition ff @xmath58 . because in the production of the @xmath1 meson from the @xmath33 decay the momentum squared of the virtual gluon can vary from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , the power corrections in this domain of @xmath61 are expected to play an important role .",
    "note , however , that we elaborate only on a theoretical framework to compute power corrections for the space - like transition ff .",
    "nevertheless , our technique can be generalized to encompass the time - like transition form factor , relevant for b meson decays , as well .",
    "work in this direction will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the rc method enables us to estimate power corrections coming from the end - point @xmath62 regions ( for definiteness we consider two mesons in an exclusive process ) in the integrals determining the amplitude for an exclusive process .",
    "it is known @xcite that in order to calculate an amplitude of some hadron exclusive process , one has to perform integrations over longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath63 of the involved partons .",
    "if one chooses the renormalization scale @xmath64 in the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath65 of the corresponding partonic subprocess in such a way as to minimize higher - order corrections and allows the qcd coupling constant @xmath66 to run , then one encounters divergences arising from the end - point @xmath62 regions .",
    "the reason is that the scale @xmath64 , as a rule , is equal to the momentum squared of the hard virtual partons , the latter carrying the strong interactions in the subprocess feynman diagrams @xcite and , in general , depends on @xmath67 and @xmath68 . within the rc method",
    "this problem is resolved by applying the ir renormalon calculus .",
    "it turns out that this treatment allows us to evaluate power - behaved corrections to the physical quantity under investigation .",
    "this method was recently used for the computation of power corrections to the electromagnetic form factors @xmath69 of the pion and the kaon , @xcite , and the electromagnetic transition ff s @xmath11 @xcite of the light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "power corrections to hadronic processes can also be calculated utilizing the landau - pole free expression for the qcd coupling constant @xcite .",
    "this analytic approach was used to compute in a unifying way power corrections to the electromagnetic pion form factor and to the inclusive cross section of the drell - yan process @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we briefly review @xmath70 mixing schemes in the flavor @xmath71 octet - singlet and the quark - flavor bases , and discuss the evolution of the quark and gluon components of the @xmath1 meson da with the factorization scale",

    "0 in this section we consider the quark - gluon content of the @xmath1 meson , as well as the @xmath1 da and give some general expressions for determining the @xmath72 transition form factor within both the standard hsa and the rc method .      the parton fock state decomposition of the pseudoscalar @xmath75 mesons ,",

    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) @xmath93 denote wave functions of the corresponding parton states .",
    "as mentioned above , the charm component of the @xmath1 meson was estimated @xcite to be too small to considerably affect the @xmath33 meson exclusive decays .",
    "therefore , in the present investigation we neglect the charm content of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the maximal admixture of the two - gluon state in the @xmath1 meson was estimated to be around @xmath94 of its content @xcite .",
    "new results from the kloe collaboration @xcite are compatible with the two - gluon contribution in the @xmath1 meson being below the level of @xmath95 .    the pure light - quark sector of the @xmath96 system without charm and gluon admixtures can be treated by means of the basic states ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) or ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) . in the @xmath85 octet - singlet basis ,",

    "there is no difference between the two bases ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .",

    "<S> it is shown that except for @xmath6 , the borel transform contains an infinite number of infrared renormalon poles . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that in the explored range of the total gluon virtuality @xmath7 , power corrections found with the rc method considerably enhance the ff @xmath8 relative to results obtained only in the context of the standard hsa with a `` frozen '' coupling . </S>"
