    "over the past three decades , a lot of approaches have been proposed to formally specify and reason about reactive systems .",
    "process algebra @xcite and temporal logic @xcite are two popular paradigms of them .    in process - algebraic paradigm , a system specification and its implementation",
    "usually are formulated in the same notation , and the underlying semantics are often given operationally . the notion of refinement is adopted to capture the correctness of implementation .",
    "in contrast , the temporal - logic paradigm adopts the language of temporal logics to formulate specifications abstractly , and implementations are described in terms of operational notations @xcite .",
    "usually , model checking technique is used to establish that the system satisfies its specification @xcite .",
    "process - algebraic paradigm supports compositional reasoning ( i.e. , refinement of one part of a system does not depend on others ) , which is one of the most significant advantages of it .",
    "the merit of temporal - logic paradigm lies in its support for abstract specifications , where relevant operational details may not be concerned .",
    "traditionally , process - algebraic and temporal - logic formalisms are not mixed .    in order to take advantage of both paradigms when designing systems , some theories for heterogeneous specifications",
    "have been proposed , e.g. , @xcite , which uniformly integrate refinement - based and temporal - logic specification styles . among them ,",
    "cleaveland and lttgen present a semantic framework for heterogenous system design based on bchi automata and labelled transition systems augmented with an unimplementability predicate , and adopt nicola and hennessy s must - testing preorder @xcite to describe refinement relation @xcite .",
    "however , such refinement relation is not a precongruence @xcite .",
    "hence , it does not support compositional reasoning .",
    "moreover , in such framework , the operator conjunction lacks the desired property that @xmath2 is an implementation of the specification @xmath3 if and only if @xmath2 implements both @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "recently , lttgen and vogler propose the notion of logic lts , which combines operational and logical styles of specification in one unified framework @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , a logic lts is a labelled transition system with an inconsistency predicate on states .",
    "a few of constructors over logic ltss are introduced , which include operational constructors , such as csp - style parallel composition and hiding , and logic constructors conjunction and disjunction .",
    "this framework allows one to freely mix operational operators and logic operators , while most early heterogenous specifications couple them loosely and do not allow for mixed specification @xcite .",
    "moreover , the drawbacks in @xcite mentioned above have been remedied by using ready - tree semantics @xcite . in order to support compositional reasoning when introducing the parallel constructor over logic ltss , a kind of modified ready simulation is adopted to describe the refinement relation @xcite .",
    "some standard temporal logic operators , such as alwaysand unless , are also integrated into this framework @xcite .",
    "conjunction is a distinctive constructor in the framework of logic ltss , we give a simple example to illustrate how it works in heterogenous system design . in figure",
    "[ f : conjunction ] , @xmath6 represents a specification which involves actions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 represents an additional constraint which requires that the action @xmath8 can not occur in the implementation .",
    "then , the dashed line in the logic lts @xmath10 represents a specification which refines @xmath6 and satisfies the constraint @xmath9 .",
    "briefly speaking , if a state in @xmath6 has @xmath8-derivative , then the constructor conjunction turns this state into inconsistent state , i.e. , unimplementable state .",
    "thus , such state can not be reached at run - time .",
    "the reader may refer to @xcite for the concrete construction of @xmath10 .",
    "up to now , logic ltss have been explored deeply , however , term - based way has not yet been involved , and the axiomatization of constructors is absent .",
    "this paper intends to develop lttgen and vogler s work along the direction suggested by them in @xcite .",
    "we present a process calculus for logic ltss ( cll , for short ) .",
    "in addition to prefix @xmath11 , external choice @xmath12 and parallel operator @xmath13 , cll contains logical operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 over process terms , which correspond to the constructors conjunction and disjunction over logic ltss respectively . follows @xcite ,",
    "a variant of the usual notion of ready simulation is adopted to formalize the refinement relation .",
    "moreover , an axiomatic system @xmath14 is provided to characterize the operators in cll in terms of ( in)equational laws , and the soundness and ground - completeness w.r.t ready simulation are established .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section recalls some related notions .",
    "section  3 introduces sos rules of cll . in section  4 ,",
    "based on reducing technique , the existence and uniqueness of stable transition model for cll is demonstrated , and a few of basic properties of the lts associated with cll are explored . section  5 develops a behavioral theory of cll .",
    "section  6 provides an axiomatic system for cll , and the soundness and ground - completeness are showed .",
