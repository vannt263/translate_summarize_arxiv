    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) has proven to be an exceptionally powerful tool for analyzing interactions involving pions in hadronic physics . as noted by weinberg @xcite , however , the implementation of conventional @xmath7pt in low energy nuclear physics is problematic since the s - wave scattering lengths are important distance scales which are much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "this `` unnatural scattering length '' problem has received considerable attention during the past several years @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to implement the ideas of effective field theory ( eft)@xcite to a problem in which both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are light scales .",
    "much of the power of efts stems from the fact that the calculation of observables is formulated in terms of an expansion parameter so that one has an _ a priori _ estimate of the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "however , many of the attempts to deal with the `` unnatural scattering length '' problem , beginning with weinbergs@xcite , formulate the expansion at the level of a potential ( or two - particle irreducible kernel ) rather than the physical observables .",
    "in such a formulation , one has no immediate estimate of the accuracy of particular observables .",
    "recently a scheme was introduced in which observables can be expressed in terms of a consistent power counting scheme@xcite . in principle",
    ", such an approach realizes the full power of the eft idea .",
    "the essence of this scheme is power counting in a single scale which we denote as @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath2 is an s - wave scattering length , and @xmath10 an external momenta .",
    "all other scales in the problem are assumed to be heavy and will be denoted @xmath11 .",
    "the power counting implies that the external momenta must be small in the sense that @xmath12 ; however , one must include all orders in @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath13 and @xmath14 to all orders introduces important nonperturbative effects .",
    "this power counting scheme has been implemented using dimensional regularization with the pds scheme @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may implement it directly in configuration space using a cutoff @xcite . in the case of s - wave scattering",
    ", it was shown that the two implementations are completely equivalent at next - to - leading order@xcite and it is plausible that this equivalence holds generally .",
    "we refer to any scheme which systematically implements eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) in the calculation of observables as the @xmath8 counting scheme .",
    "a number of observables have been calculated using @xmath8 counting at low order : n - n scattering@xcite , deuteron electro - magnetic form factors @xcite and deuteron polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "all of these calculations appear to describe the experimental data reasonably well .",
    "in this paper we use @xmath8 counting to derive low energy theorems for coefficients of the effective range expansion ( ere ) .",
    "the ere is a useful way to parameterize s - wave scattering when the scattering length is unnaturally long .",
    "it is given by @xmath15 as we will show below , the @xmath16 coefficients ( @xmath17 ) can be calculated in a next - to - leading order calculation of @xmath18 .",
    "one obtains predictions which are valid up to corrections of relative order @xmath19 , where @xmath11 is the scale characterizing the short - ranged physics .",
    "moreover , these are direct predictions with no free parameters ; in this sense these are low energy theorems .",
    "however , when we compare these predicted @xmath16 coefficients with ones extracted from a fit to the scattering data , we find that they fail quite badly ; they predict @xmath16 s several times larger than those extracted from the data .",
    "we also derive theorems , valid to corrections of relative order @xmath19 , for coefficients characterizing the momentum dependence of @xmath20@xmath21 mixing at low momentum .",
    "these theorems also do not work well ; they predict coefficients which differ from the those extracted from data by more than 100% .",
    "this poses an interesting question .",
    "why are these theorems failing so badly when other predictions of @xmath8 counting seem to work rather well ?",
    "one likely reason is that the successful predictions of the @xmath8 counting depend on different physics than what is being tested by these low energy theorems .",
    "the present predictions are extremely sensitive to the role played by the pion exchange in the two nucleon s - wave channel ; most of the high quality predictions are not .",
    "it is useful to note that the @xmath8 counting eft program of refs .",
    "@xcite , has two main components ",
    "i ) dealing with the `` unnaturally long scattering length '' problem ( @xmath22 ) , and ii ) `` including pions '' ( @xmath23)@xcite .",
    "it is important to test both . in @xmath8",
    "counting @xmath1 and @xmath0 are both formally treated as being of order @xmath8 . in reality , however , @xmath24 in both the singlet and triplet channels .",
    "accordingly it is possible that most of the success seen to date is coming about because the expansion in @xmath1 is working even if the expansion in @xmath0 is failing .",
    "the importance of testing the `` including pions '' part of the program should be very clear .",
    "much of the original motivation for developing the effective field theory approach for nuclear scattering was to exploit chiral symmetry and develop a description of nuclear phenomenon in terms of a controlled chiral expansion .",
    "the advantage of including pions as explicit light degrees of freedom , rather than integrating them out as heavy , should be obvious .",
    "if the chiral expansion is under control , the inclusion of explicit pionic degrees of freedom will significantly improve the predictions at low @xmath10 and will significantly increase the maximum value of @xmath10 for which the effective treatment is useful .",
    "this suggests a simple way to test the `` including pions '' part of the @xmath8 counting program .",
    "one should calculate qualities in two efts ",
    "one including explicit pions and implementing the @xmath8 counting in eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) , and the other in an eft with pions integrated out and using @xmath25 as the basis for the power counting .",
    "the differences between these two calculations ( done at the same order in @xmath8 ) is a measure of the effect of `` including pions '' .",
    "for many observables , the pion integrated out theory may give extremely accurate predictions .",
    "both the quartet nucleon - deuteron scattering length @xcite and the deuteron charge radius @xcite were predicted using systematic eft approaches with the pion integrated out .",
    "clearly the two preceding successes reflect the usefulness of the @xmath26 counting scheme ( which is essentially the @xmath27 counting introduced by van kolck@xcite ) , and have nothing to do with chiral counting .",
    "it is possible that most of the successes of the @xmath8 counting approach similarly do not test the pionic aspects .",
    "accordingly before concluding that chiral perturbation theory aspect of @xmath8 counting in nuclear physics is under control , it is critical to find observables which test the chiral physics .",
    "the @xmath16 coefficients in the effective range expansion are an ideal way to test the pion physics .",
    "the central reason for using the effective range expansion is to isolate the effects of an unnaturally small scattering length from the remaining terms in the expansion .",
    "consider first a theory with pions integrated out .",
    "in such a theory , the @xmath16 coefficients must be @xmath28 since they are insensitive to @xmath2 and there are no other light scales in the problem .",
    "in contrast , as we will explicitly demonstrate below , these coefficients are non - analytic in @xmath8 with @xmath29 .",
    "thus , they are large in a theory with explicit pions and order unity in a theory with pions integrated out . since there is a large difference between the two cases the predictions for the @xmath16 s sensitively test the pion physics",
    ". we will also show below that when pions are explicitly included , the calculated @xmath16 are not merely non - analytic in @xmath8 .",
    "for all of the @xmath16 , each of the leading order terms in @xmath8 are non - analytic in @xmath0 ; diverging as @xmath30 .",
    "since these coefficients diverge as @xmath30 it is clear that they are dominated by pionic effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the following section we derive low energy theorems for the coefficients in the effective range expansion ; analogous theorems for @xmath4@xmath6 mixing are derived next .",
    "after that we compare the predictions with coefficients extracted from the nijmegen partial wave analysis @xcite of the scattering data . finally we discuss why these failures might have been anticipated in light of the known scales in the nucleon - nucleon problem , and how the failures of the low energy theorems can be reconciled with the apparently successful predictions for the phase shifts reported in ref .",
    "in developing physical intuition for our low energy theorems , we find it somewhat more useful to use the cutoff formulation discussed in ref .",
    "the essential physical idea in this approach is to implement the separation of long distance physics from short distance physics directly in configuration space .",
    "a radius , @xmath31 , is introduced as a matching point between long and short distance effects ; renormalization group invariance requires that physical quantities must be independent of @xmath31 .",
    "it is important , however , that @xmath31 be chosen large enough so that essentially all of the effects of the short distance physics is contained within @xmath31 .",
    "the potential is divided into the sum of two pieces , a short distance part which vanishes for @xmath32 and long distance part which vanishes for @xmath33 . at @xmath31 , the information about short distance effects is entirely contained in the energy dependence of the logarithmic derivative ( with respect to position ) of the wave function at @xmath31 .",
    "thus , provided we can parameterize this information systematically , we can formulate the problem in a way which is insensitive to the details of the short distance part of the potential . for @xmath32 the schrdinger equation",
    "is solved subject to the boundary conditions at @xmath31 . for s wave scattering ,",
    "the wave function at @xmath31 may be parameterize as @xmath34 ; the energy dependence of the logarithmic derivative is independent of @xmath35 and can be expressed in terms of an expansion similar to an effective range expansion : @xmath36 power counting in @xmath8 for s wave scattering can be implemented straightforwardly .",
    "all of the coefficients in the preceeding expansion are assumed to be order @xmath37 except the first term ( @xmath38 ) which will be taken to be order @xmath39 to reflect the unnaturally large scale of the scattering length .",
    "power counting for the long range part of the potential simply follows wienberg s analysis @xcite , with the previso that the potentials are only used for @xmath40 . at order @xmath41 in @xmath18 , only the simple one pion exchange contribution to the @xmath42 contributes .",
    "the power counting also justifies an iterative solution of the schrdinger equation for @xmath32 along the lines of a conventional born series .",
    "it differs from the usual born series in that the boundary conditions at @xmath31 are implemented .",
    "finally , @xmath8 counting is used in expanding out the final expression for @xmath18 .",

    "how , then , can the @xmath16 coefficients in the effective range expansion describing the same scattering data all be badly wrong ?",
    "the answer is , in fact , quite simple .",
    "the principal point is simply that the general shape of the phase shift curve  a very rapid rise at low @xmath10 followed by a slow decrease is implied directly from the effective range expansion with large @xmath2 ; _ any _ theory with free parameters consistent with the effective range expansion will be able to reproduce the crude shape .",

    "moreover , the _ global _ fit used in ref .",
    "@xcite masks possible subtle problems with the detailed shape of the fit to the phase shifts .",

    "@xcite which goes to the heart of the issue relating to the role of pions in the effective field theory program .    as we have argued in the introduction ,",
    "the easiest way to test the role of pions in the eft is to compare a calculation in an eft with explicit pions to a calculation at the same order in an eft with the pions integrated out .",
    "if the chiral expansion is working well we should find that the inclusion of explicit pions both substantially improves the quality of agreement of the low @xmath10 observables with the data and increase the range in @xmath10 for which the eft is useful . here , since we are working at order @xmath41 in @xmath18 , the theory with pions integrated out is simply the effective range expansion up to the effective range term .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the difference of @xmath18 from the nijmegen@xcite partial wave analysis in the @xmath3 channel from three order @xmath41 eft predictions : a ) a pions - integrated - out theory with parameters fit to the observed @xmath2 and @xmath91 ( this is precisely the first two terms in the effective range expansion ) ; b ) a pions - explicitly - included theory with the parameters in eq .",

    "we have plotted the difference from the data to focus attention on the accuracy of the predictions ( in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite ) . plotting the data in this manner also removes the visual effect of reproducing the rise and fall of the phase shifts .",
    "the striking thing about fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that the inclusion of pions does not improve the quality of the fit at low @xmath10 compared to the pion - less theory .",
    "indeed , at moderately low energies , the inclusion of pions markedly worsens the agreement of theory with experiment compared to the pion - integrated - out theory .",
    "this strongly suggests that the chiral expansion is not under control .",
    "having seen this , it is not so surprising that the global fit is so poor at low energies ; it was designed to compromise the low energy behavior in order to do better at larger @xmath8 . in testing low energy observables ,",
    "however , it is more appropriate to use coefficients fit to the low energy behavior . indeed , there is an ambiguity in using the global fit parameters . in the plot",
    "we have evaluated @xmath10 times the cotangent of the phase shifts from the expression in ref.@xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could have used the global fit parameters directly in the expression for @xmath92 in eqs .",
    "( [ kcotd1 ] ) and ( [ equiv ] ) .",
    "while these two forms agree to order @xmath41 , they differ at higher order .",
    "as the fit was done using @xmath93 rather than @xmath18 we felt it more reasonable to plot it this way .",
    "had we used the same parameters in the @xmath18 expression the fit would have markedly worsened .",
    "the @xmath16 coefficients directly measure the improvement of the theory with explicit pions over the theory with pions integrated out .",
    "the pion - less theory at this order is simply the effective range expansion up to the @xmath91 term ; the @xmath16 coefficients parameterize the way in which the phase shifts deviate from this expression .",
    "thus the failure of the effective field theory treatment to get the @xmath16 coefficients is also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and suggests a failure of the `` including pions '' part of the @xmath8 counting program  at least so far as the s - wave scattering is concerned .",
    "it should also be remarked that the failure in the prediction of the @xmath5 parameter evident in these @xmath80 coefficients is much worse than suggested by the plot of @xmath5 against @xmath10 in ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , at low @xmath10 , the predicted @xmath5 appears to be @xmath94 40% above the data at low energy ( although the predicted shape differs greatly from the observed one at higher energies ) .",
    "how can this be reconciled with a @xmath95 parameter predicted in our low energy theorem which is 2.3 times the observed one ?",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is related to the fit used . using the global fit parameters of ref .",

    "in contrast , using the physical scattering length , as we do in eq .",

    ", one must view the better agreement of the calculation using the global fit parameters as being fortuitous .",
    "moreover , the large disagreement between calculation based on the global fit and the one based on the @xmath2 is itself an indication that the expansion has broken down",
    ".    it should be obvious from the pattern of failure for both of these low energy theorems that the @xmath11 , the scale of the short distance physics , is _ not _ much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite provides some insight as to why this might be expected which may not be as immediately apparent in the pds formalism . in the derivation",
    "using the cutoff formalism , the expansion in @xmath97 came in two distinct ways .",
    "the first was in justifying the perturbative inclusion of the pion exchange interaction in a manner similar to the born series but with boundary conditions at some matching radius @xmath31 to reflect the short distance physics .",
    "the second was in the expansion of @xmath98 in the various integrals which arise .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the derivation that this bound on @xmath31 can not be saturated , since the bound is saturated only if the wave function is strictly zero for @xmath33 ; the actual value of @xmath31 beyond which the short distance potential ceases to make significant contributions is accordingly expected to be significantly larger suggesting a value of @xmath104 .",
    "for example , if the short distance potential for the @xmath3 channel is taken to be a square well whose depth and range is fit to the scattering length and effective range , then @xmath105 fm @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "an obvious conclusion is that the scale of the short distance contribution to the nucleon - nucleon interaction is not well separated from @xmath0 making the chiral expansion highly problematic .",
    "of course , it might be argued that the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite includes only one pion exchange and short distance physics .",
    "it does not include higher order long distance effects such as two pion exchange which could alter the result .",
    "however , if one is in regime where @xmath8 counting is valid , then two pion exchange and similar mechanisms only contribute to @xmath18 at order @xmath65 or higher and may be neglected , implying that the bound in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid up to corrections of order @xmath19 .",
    "the justification of the perturbative , born - like expansion for the inclusion of the pion exchange interaction also may be problematic . in ref .",
    "@xcite the quantity , @xmath107 , was taken to play the role of @xmath11 and the dimensionless parameter , @xmath108 , was identified as playing the role of the expansion parameter . in terms of the derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is clear that @xmath109 .",
    "the potential difficulty for @xmath7 pt was identified in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath110 is rather large ; numerically @xmath111 .",
    "if the relevant parameter is in fact @xmath110 , one might expect a slowly converging theory . on the other hand ,",
    "if the relevant parameter is more like 2 @xmath110 , things are quite out of control .",
    "moreover , this expansion parameter arises in the context of the central force . in the triplet channel",
    "there is also a tensor force . while formally in @xmath8 counting the effect of the tensor force",
    "is higher order , experience in the nuclear physics problem is that it is quite important owing to large numerical factors . given both the problems with the @xmath98 expansion and the justification of a perturbative treatment for the pion , the failures of the low energy theorems are not so surprising .",
    "the possibility of problems with the perturbative treatment of the pion exchange interaction implicit in the pds scheme has been raised previously by gegelia@xcite and steele and furnstahl @xcite using rather different arguments . here",
    "we have shown explicitly in the case of the @xmath16 coefficients in s - wave scattering and the @xmath80 coefficients in the @xmath112@xmath113 mixing that the``including pions '' aspect of the systematic @xmath8 counting approach in nuclear physics fails badly .",
    "we have also given general arguments that there exist `` short distance '' scales in the nucleon - nucleon problem which are @xmath114 suggesting that the `` including pion '' parts of @xmath8 counting may be expected to have problems .",
    "it remains to be seen just how widespread these problems will turn out to be . clearly the perturbative pions work well in high partial waves , but the question remains whether observables sensitive to both the pion physics and to s - wave nucleon - nucleon interactions are generally well described in @xmath8 counting . in order to determine this ,",
    "it is necessary to study a number of observables which are particularly sensitive to pion range physics .",
    "the authors thank silas beane and daniel phillips for interesting discussions .",
    "we are indebted to vincent stoks for providing us with numerical values of the effective range expansion coefficients for potential model calculations of the @xmath3 channel .",
    "we also thank mike birse for pointing out to us the issue discussed in the appendix .",
    "tdc gratefully acknowledges the support of the u.s .",
    "in ref . @xcite it was shown that the pds and cutoff expressions for @xmath115 are equivalent provided the coefficients in the two approaches are matched as given by eq .",
    "( [ equiv ] ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by birse@xcite there is an apparent difficulty with this equivalence as the chiral limit is approached .",
    "note that @xmath8 counting formally holds if both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are small , however the combination @xmath116 is unconstrained and can take any value .",
    "thus , a scheme which implements @xmath8 consistently should be able to correctly describe the formal limit @xmath30 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "this formal limit , is of course nothing but the chiral limit in a regime where @xmath8 counting holds .",
    "we note , at the outset , that this limit is clearly not of immediate practical concern since in nature @xmath119 .",
    "never - the - less , if the @xmath8 counting scheme is viable , nothing in the formalism should prevent an approach to the chiral limit .",
    "the potential problem is quite clear in the last equation of eqs .",
    "( [ equiv ] ) : the left - hand side goes to zero in the chiral limit while the right - hand side does not , suggesting that the equivalence can not hold for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "the difficulty stems from a minor inconsistency with the pds formulation which can be cured easily and which has no observable consequences for nn scattering .",
    "note that as the chiral limit of the last equation of eqs .",
    "( [ equiv ] ) is taken , the right - hand side is not merely nonzero , it is @xmath120 dependent .",

    "in contrast @xmath128 serves as a counter term absorbing the @xmath120 dependence , is not iterated to all orders and only contributes at order @xmath41 .",
