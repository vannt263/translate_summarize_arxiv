    "proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) are objects in transition between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula ( pn ) phases in the evolution of intermediate- and low - mass stars . as such ,",
    "they are characterized by a central star of spectral type b@xmath1 g surrounded by an expanding envelope of gas and dust .",
    "selecting ppn candidates is difficult using only visible light observations , but the excess mid - infrared emission produced by their cool dust affords a good means to identify ppn candidates .",
    "thus , following the _ iras _ mission , it became possible to identify a number of candidates and to confirm them with ground - based observations @xcite , followed up with _ hst _ imaging @xcite and _ iso _ @xcite and _ spitzer _ @xcite mid - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "it was seen that most ppns could be characterized as oxygen - rich ( c / o@xmath21 ) or carbon - rich ( c / o@xmath31 ) based on mid - infrared spectral features .",
    "the o - rich sources display silicate emission or absorption features at 9.7 and 18 @xmath4 m and some show crystalline silicate emission features at somewhat longer wavelengths .",
    "the less common c - rich sources show unidentified infrared features ( uirs ) at 6.2 , 7.6 , 8.6 and 11.3 @xmath4 m commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , with a broad feature around 30 @xmath4 m ( the so - called `` 30 @xmath4 m feature '' ) often attributed to mgs and an as yet unidentified feature at 20 @xmath4 m ( the so - called `` 21 @xmath4 m feature '' ) .",
    "agb and post - agb objects , such as rv tauri variables , are known to pulsate , so it was reasonable to assume that the central stars in ppns might also vary in brightness due to pulsation .",
    "such variability has indeed been seen in galactic ppne @xcite .",
    "@xcite have published the results of a long - term ( 14-year ) photometric study of twelve galactic c - rich ppns .",
    "they are of spectral types f and g and all show the 21 @xmath4 m feature .",
    "periodic variability is found in each of them , with periods ranging from 38 to 153 days .",
    "in addition , a clear linear correlation was found to exist between both pulsation period and effective temperature and between pulsation period and pulsation amplitude over this f@xmath1 g spectral range . in still hotter ppns",
    ", shorter - term variability is seen ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    a good sample of 17 candidates for c - rich ppns in the lmc and smc has been identified by @xcite , on the basis of _ spitzer _ mid - infrared spectra .",
    "they all have strong mid - infrared excesses with dust temperatures of 200@xmath1350 k. they show a range of emission features characteristic of c - rich objects @xmath1 uirs , 21 @xmath4 m feature , 30 @xmath4 m feature , and perhaps sic in a few @xmath1 although most show only some of these features .",
    "nine show the 21 @xmath4 m feature and in four others it is either present but very weak or of questionable presence . in a related study ,",
    "@xcite enlarged this sample with an additional 25 post - agb objects in the lmc / smc that are identified as c - rich on the basis of their _ spitzer _ mid - infrared spectra .",
    "twenty - two of these have been classified as pns .",
    "many of these objects have previously been mistakenly classified as young stellar objects ( ysos ) or yso candidates based primarily upon their infrared colors .",
    "indeed , in most color - color and color - magnitude diagrams made from near - infrared and mid - infrared magnitudes , there is a strong overlap between ysos and post - agb objects .",
    "the detailed analysis by @xcite , which included modeling of the double - peaked seds , the published visible - band spectroscopic analysis of several of these as discussed later in this paper , and our variability study shows that these objects are ppns rather than ysos .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a study of the light variability of c - rich lmc and smc ppn candidates , based primarily on light curves from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project .",
    "the ppn candidates are primarily the 17 identified by @xcite .",
    "the sample was increased slightly by the addition of the three non - pn sources included in the study by @xcite .",
    "finally , we included two additional lmc objects studied by @xcite that are shown to be c - rich based on high - resolution abundance analyses @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these later two has a _",
    "spitzer _ mid - infrared spectrum",
    ". however , both have large infrared excesses consistent with ppns with detached circumstellar shells , and both have infrared colors , k@xmath1[24 ] versus k@xmath1[8.0 ] , consistent with the colors of known ppn candidates , where the k magnitudes are from the 2mass survey and the [ 8.0 ] and [ 24 ] magnitudes are from the spitzer space telescope observations . our goal is to investigate the photometric variability in this sample of c - rich ppn candidates to determine periods and amplitudes of pulsation where they exist , and to compare them to the relationships found for c - rich ppns in the mwg .",
    "since the metallicities are different between the lmc , smc , and mwg , this also affords the potential opportunity to investigate differences in pulsation properties due to composition . we will also attempt to classify the nature of each object .",
    "the 22 objects are listed in table  [ object_list ] . for convenience , we will often list them by their number in table  [ object_list ] .",
    "the main data sets that we used in this study are from the ogle surveys , ogle - ii @xcite and ogle - iii @xcite . for some of the objects the data are publicly available and for others they are still proprietary .",
    "the ogle - ii data set covers the years 1997@xmath12000 and involves five seasons of observing in the lmc and four seasons of observing in the smc , with most of the data with the cousins _ i _ filter but some with the johnson _ v _ filter .",
    "the ogle - iii data set covers the years 2001 - 2009 in the _ i _ filter , involving eight seasons of observing , with occasional observations in the _ v _ filter .",
    "for some of the fainter sources , we have removed data points with unusually large uncertainties .",
    "we formed ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) color data points from _ v _ and _ i _ observations that were made on the same night .",
    "ogle - iii data are available for 19 of the 22 objects ( all but objects 5 , 8 , and 14 ) and ogle - ii for five objects ( 2 , 4 , 9 , 12 , and 18 ) .",
    "for the three objects without ogle data ( 5 , 8 , and 14 ) , we used data from the macho project @xcite .",
    "these cover the years from late-1992/early-1993 to late-1999/early-2000 ( depending upon the object ) .",
    "the magnitudes listed in the macho catalog are instrumental magnitudes .",
    "to give more meaningful values for the graphs that we display for these objects , we adjusted them to approximately standard magnitudes using zero - point offsets derived from published photometric measurements for these objects . to designate that they are only approximate , non - standard values",
    ", we list them with primes : v@xmath5 and r@xmath6 .",
    "the subsequent analyses were done with the original , instrumental macho catalog data . in table  [ statistics ] are listed some statistics of the data sets used , including the average uncertainties of the data .",
    "the average uncertainties in the observations range from @xmath00.005 mag for the brighter objects ( _ i_=13 - 15 mag , _",
    "v_@xmath715.5 mag ) to @xmath00.1 mag ( _ i _ ) and @xmath00.2 mag ( _ v _ ) for the fainter objects ( _ i_=19 - 20 mag , _",
    "v_=21 - 22 mag ) .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "are shown the _",
    "i _ light curves of the five objects with both ogle - ii and ogle - iii data and in figures  [ fig2a ] and [ fig2b ] the objects with only ogle - iii data . in figure  [ fig3 ] are shown the r@xmath6 light curves of the three objects with only macho data .",
    "the ogle _ v _ versus _",
    "v@xmath1i _ and the macho v@xmath5 versus v@xmath5@xmath1r@xmath6 color curves are shown in figure  [ color ] . for three of the objects ( 14 , 17 , 19 )",
    "there are no _ v _ observations and thus no color curves .",
    "the light curves were were first examined visually to investigate variability within a season and also long - term variability .",
    "all are seen to vary .",
    "they were then analyzed for periodicity .",
    "we used the period search programs period04 @xcite and clean @xcite , both of which are based on a fourier transform .",
    "the results of the frequency analyses were the same .",
    "we present the results from period04 because it is more versatile , since it allows one to determine the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a given period , fits the light curve with a sine curve of calculated amplitude , and can easily be used to investigate multiple periods . to judge",
    "if a period was significant , we used the recommended period04 criterion that if the s / n amplitude ratio of the peak in the frequency power spectrum was @xmath8 4 , it was regarded as significant @xcite . for those with significant periods of variation , we also explored the existence of multiple periods .",
    "some objects show long - term seasonal trends in the light level or what appear to be season - to - season variations in the mean light levels .",
    "for the former of these , we first removed the long - term trends before conducting the period analysis . for those that showed the season - to - season variations , we analyzed the light curves as observed and also as normalized to the seasonal average values .",
    "this normalization was done by calculating the average value within a season , adjusting the seasonal averages to a common value ( 0.00 ) , and then doing the period study .",
    "we typically determined similar periods for the observed and seasonally - normalize data . in a few cases a long period ( @xmath3 1 year ) was suggested that modulated the seasonal light curve levels .",
    "since our goal was to determine pulsational periods , we have chosen to use the results from the normalized light curves .",
    "the question of the cause of these longer - term variations will be addressed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the analyses of the ogle data were carried out on the _ i _ light curves and the analyses of the macho data were carried out on both the instrumental v@xmath5 and r@xmath6 light curves .",
    "all of the objects are seen to vary in light .",
    "only eight of them show clearly periodic variability , with one other showing less certain periodicity .",
    "these nine are discussed individually in this section ; the others are discussed in appendix i. these objects have been included in large surveys of variable stars in the lmc or smc @xcite , with periods cited for 10 of them . in most but not all cases , the periods determined are similar to ours .",

    "the multi - period fits to the light curves appear to vary from good ( objects 2 and 4 ) to poor ( object 5 )",
    ". however , a part of this has to do with the range of the variation .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the amplitude of the variation and the average residual of the fit .",
    "the fits for objects 8 , 11 , and 12 do not appear to be very good , but they actually have the smallest average residuals .",
    "and one can see in many cases that the observed light curve fits tend to produce good timings for the light curve maxima and minima but the amplitudes are often not well fit .",
    "one could expect a better fit if the amplitudes were permitted to change with time .",
    "the complex nature of ppn light curves is not surprising , given that shocks are produced as they pulsate .",
    "these are predicted based on modeling of the pulsation @xcite and has been observed spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a clear correlation for galactic c - rich ppns between pulsation period and both the effective temperature and the amplitude of the variation .",
    "such correlations are expected since ppns evolve with time toward higher temperatures as the stars decrease in size due to both the fusion of hydrogen at the base of the atmosphere and the presence of a fast wind removing the outer envelope .",
    "thus one expects the surface gravity to increase as the star evolves from g to b spectral type , and assuming that the pulsations are radial , this will cause the period to decrease with time .",
    "we have examined the objects in our present sample that have periods to see if such relationships exit for lmc / smc objects .",
    "this requires that we have t@xmath26 for those with periods .",
    "a detailed , high - resolution abundance study of object 2 has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "they found the object to indeed be c - rich , with c / o = 1.9@xmath100.7 , iron poor ( [ fe / h]=@xmath11.34@xmath100.32 ) , and with a high abundance of s - process elements . from their atmospheric model ,",
    "they determined t@xmath26 = 6250 @xmath10 250 k. similarly , @xcite carried out a detailed high - resolution abundance study of objects 5 , 12 , and 16 and determined t@xmath26 values of 5750 , 6750 , and 5500 k , respectively .",
    "they found them each to be c - rich , with c / o abundance of 2.1 ( average , based on two different spectra observed one month apart ) , 1.5 , and 2.5 , respectively , and all iron poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath11.2 ) but with a high abundance of s - process elements .",
    "these are common properties of galactic ppns @xcite .",
    "thus four of the eight ppns with well - determined periods have temperature determinations based on high - resolution spectra and model atmosphere analyses ( nos . 2 , 5 , 12 , and 16 ) .",
    "additional spectra of three objects at lower spectral resolution ( 1500@xmath13000 ) have been obtained and analyzed by @xcite using model atmospheres . for two of these",
    "we have been found periods .",
    "all three were determined to have low gravities ( log  _ g _ = @xmath10.5 ) and low metallicities ( [ m / h ] @xmath7 @xmath11.0 ) .",
    "they determined temperatures for objects 8 and 12 as 6750 and 6250 k , respectively . for object 12 ,",
    "for which there are two temperature determinations , we will use the value of 5750 k based on higher - resolution spectra in our discussion of possible correlations , but it may simply be that the higher value of 6250 k was obtained when the object was brighter and bluer .",
    "object 1 has been classified as a carbon star or post - agb star on the basis of its infrared excess and its optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , a comparison of its spectrum with those of carbon - rich galactic ppns suggests that it shows the weaker c@xmath18 absorption features commonly seen in these ppns , although in contrast it possesses an unusually strong h@xmath23 emission feature .",
    "on the basis of its similarity to iras z02229 + 6208 @xcite , we classify its spectrum as approximately g8@xmath1k0 0-ia and assign it an approximate temperature of 5500 k @xcite .",
    "these temperature values are listed in table  [ results ] .",
    "the results for the comparison of _ p _ and _ t@xmath26 _ are shown in figure  [ p - t ] , where we have also shown the results of @xcite for 12 c - rich ppns in the mwg .",
    "note that they found a linear relationship over the temperature range 5000@xmath18000 k , and empirically determined a rate of decrease of @xmath20@xmath27/@xmath20@xmath28@xmath26 = @xmath10.047 days k@xmath29 .",
    "the sample size is much smaller in the present study ; there are only four lmc and two smc objects and the range in temperature is more limited than in the mwg .",
    "these four lmc ppns also show a trend of decreasing _",
    "p _ with increasing _",
    "t@xmath26_. comparing the two samples , one sees that three of the lmc values lie to the left of those of the mwg objects , at systematically lower temperatures or shorter periods .",
    "this sample is small , so the differences may not be significant . if it is real , however , one possible explanation that comes immediately to mind is the difference in metallicity between the two galaxies , with the metallicity of the lmc about 0.4 of the solar metallicity @xcite . but",
    "ppns are known to be metal poor compared to the sun , @xcite , so one should compare directly the metal abundance for the two samples .",
    "for the three lmc objects analyzed by @xcite , the metallicities are [ fe / h ] = @xmath11.2 with very little variation .",
    "this can be compared with the values of those in the mwg .",
    "similar high - resolution spectral analyses of the mwg sample show a range of [ fe / h ] = @xmath10.3 to @xmath11.0 , with an average value of @xmath10.7 @xcite .",
    "this difference in [ fe / h ] of @xmath10.5 implies a metallicity of these c - rich lmc ppns of one third of the value of those in the mwg .",
    "thus an apparent offset could occur if , at the same _ t@xmath26 _ , a lower metallicity resulted in a shorter period of pulsation .    the relationship of pulsation period with amplitude can also be examined .",
    "@xcite compared the maximum seasonal peak - to - peak @xmath20_v _ amplitude with _",
    "p _ , and found a general , direct , although not linear relationship between @xmath20_v _ and _ p _ ; the objects with _",
    "greater than 120@xmath1130 days possessed significantly larger amplitudes ( generally 0.5@xmath10.6 mag ) , while those with shorter periods had smaller amplitudes ( 0.13@xmath10.23 mag ) .",
    "we have plotted in figure  [ p - amp ] these parameters for the eight lmc / smc objects that have periods , where we have also reproduced the relationship found for the mwg ( * ? ? ?",

    "most of the individual points are in agreement : the object with the longest period has the largest amplitude and those with shorter periods have smaller amplitudes in the range 0.14@xmath10.23 mag . however , there are two objects in this present sample that are not in agreement with this trend .",
    "the smc object 1 at p = 96 days and @xmath20_v _ = 0.40 mag has an amplitude that is about twice as large as other objects with periods of @xmath0100 days .",
    "lmc object 1 , with a large period of 142 days , has a small @xmath20_v _ amplitude of only 0.15 mag .",
    "this is anomalous since it is even smaller than the @xmath20_i _ amplitude of 0.21 mag . in all of the other objects in this sample and in the study by @xcite",
    ", it was found that the amplitude was larger at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we propose that this deviant value is due to the fact that there are many fewer v than i observations , by about a factor of ten , which in this case has conspired to not show the full amplitude in v. we attempted to empirically correct this by scaling the @xmath20_i _ amplitude by the typical value of the ratio of the amplitude range in _",
    "v _ to that in _",
    "i _ for the other four with ogle _ v _ and _ i _ data .",
    "this ratio has an average value of 1.5 , and then multiplying the @xmath20_i _ value by this one gets the scaled @xmath20_v _ value .",
    "we do the same with object 22 , which has no ogle _ v _ data .",
    "these are plotted in figure  [ p - amp ] , with distinguishing symbols .",
    "examination of table  [ var ] does raise the question about the large amplitudes measured for some of the non - periodic variables .",
    "three of the four objects with the largest seasonal peak - to - peak variations are not long - period variables .",
    "rather , no periods have been found for them , which may seem inconsistent with the trend discussed above",
    ". however , these three are among the faintest sources in this study ( @xmath2@xmath9@xmath3 @xmath8 19.0 mag ) and they possess the largest photometric uncertainties .",
    "this level of faintness and photometric uncertainty is the likely cause of the large ranges in their brightness .",
    "the fourth of these with the large seasonal value of @xmath20@xmath9 is the periodic object with the longest period ( 157 days , no .",
    "4 ) , consistent with the trend discussed above .",

    "this relationship has previously been found for all of the c - rich f@xmath1 g ppns in the mwg @xcite .",
    "this is attributed in most cases to changes in temperature as the stars pulsate .",
    "we have investigated this further for those that have temperature determinations based on high - resolution spectra and model atmosphere analyses .",
    "the observed color variations were used to find the range in temperature variations .",
    "comparison of the times of the spectroscopic observations with light curves revealed the pulsation phases , from which we determined the actual temperature changes .",
    "objects 12 and 16 had good light curve coverage at the times of the spectra , and were at approximately minimum and slightly above mid - level of the light curves , respectively . for object 2 ,",
    "the light curve coverage stops about three - fourths of a cycle before the spectroscopic observation , but the data are so well fitted by the model curve that we feel confident that the spectroscopic observation was made when the star was at mid - level in its light curve . for object 5 , the only other object in the sample with a temperature determined from high - resolution spectra , the photometric observations derive from the macho data set , which ended some eight years prior to the spectroscopic observation . we have not tried to extrapolate to find the phase at the time of the spectrum .",
    "we used the color@xmath1temperature relations for supergiants as listed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 15.7 ) .",
    "since this uses ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) colors on the johnson system , we converted our observations from the cousins system using the relationships given by @xcite .",
    "these temperature ranges are listed in table  [ tvar ] ; they vary from 350 to 1100 k and represent the maximum temperature changes in a season for these three stars . in a detailed photometric and radial velocity study for two mwg c - rich ppns , @xcite found that they were largest in size when faintest and coolest , and that they were smallest when brightest and hottest .",
    "while it is likely that these lmc / smc c - rich ppns pulsate in a similar fashion , it would be useful to confirm this for a few of the brightest ones with contemporaneous radial velocity and light measurements .",
    "these three lmc / smc objects have rather modest changes in @xmath20(_v@xmath1i _ ) , ranging from 0.07 to 0.18 mag .",
    "five of the objects in the sample have much larger color ranges , from 0.5@xmath10.9 mag . however , these are the five faintest sources ( in _ v _ ) in the sample , with very large average uncertainties in ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) color indices ranging from 0.10 to 0.19 mag , so much of the large color range may be attributed to the large uncertainties in their observations .",
    "several of the objects show longer - term , often monotonic changes in brightness .",
    "three ( nos . 6 ,",
    "20 , 22 ) show monotonic increases of @xmath80.08 mag ( _ i _ ) , one ( 17 ) shows a large increase ( 0.19 mag ) followed by a large decrease ( 0.09 mag ) , while three more ( 2 , 18 , 21 ) show significant changes over several years in one direction , brighter or fainter , over only part of the observing interval .",
    "object 19 shows a a large ( 0.5 mag ) and rapid increase in brightness during season one , followed by a more gradual increase of 0.2 mag over the following seven years . among these eight objects",
    "are the four faintest ones ( nos .",
    "6 , 17 , 18 , 22 ) , @xmath2i@xmath3 @xmath8 19.0 mag , and for these faint objects some of these trends may reflect large and systematic uncertainties in the data . however , the other four ( 2 , 19 , 20 , 21 ) are bright to medium - bright , @xmath2i@xmath3 = 14.5@xmath118.3 mag , with relatively small uncertainties in the individual data points ( @xmath13=0.004@xmath10.03 mag ) .",
    "we have seen such trends in our study of mwg ppns and suspect that they are due to systematic changes in the line - of - site opacity of the circumstellar dust .",
    "decreases in brightness could be due to increases in dust opacity , such as from a recent mass ejection event , and increases would be due to the dissipation of dust through expansion . or either could be due to the passage of a dust cloud across the line - of - site .",
    "object 19 is a special case , since it shows a relatively large increase in a single season . in this",
    "it is somewhat reminiscent of the mwg c - rich ppn iras 19500@xmath11709 , although on a more extreme scale .",
    "iras 19500@xmath11709 showed a sudden decrease of 0.12 mag ( v ) and increase in reddening ( @xmath20(_b@xmath1v)_=+0.05 mag ) in a single season , followed by a rise of 0.19 mag over the next four years @xcite .",
    "@xcite attributed this to changing dust opacity .",
    "another , more interesting possibility , is that object 19 is coming out of eclipse by a binary companion .",
    "unfortunately there are not ogle - ii observations to document the light curve of the previous four years .",
    "however , to investigate this further , we examined the macho data for this object ( macho 76.9852.1227 ) .",
    "while these data have a large uncertainty , with @xmath2@xmath13@xmath30@xmath3 = 0.13 after the removal of some observations with very large uncertainties , they do show a clear pattern over the six ( 1993@xmath11999 ) years of observations .",
    "the object appears to decrease in brightness by @xmath00.9 mag over the first four years and then increase by @xmath00.6 mag ( _ r _ ) over the next two .",
    "there is then a two - year gap before the ogle - iii data , which then begin with the rapid increase in brightness of 0.5 mag ( _ i _ ) . taken together ,",
    "these data sets are not consistent with an eclipse .",
    "rather they are reminiscent of the r coronae borealis ( rcb ) phenomenon , with sudden drops in brightness and also low - amplitude cyclical variations .",
    "for rcb stars , which are also c - rich , the drops in brightness are large , up to 8 mag on time scales of a few years , and the low - amplitude variations have typical cycle lengths of 40@xmath1110 days with amplitudes of a few tenths mag @xcite .",
    "the brightness decreases in rcb stars are attributed to dust formation episodes that partially obscure the star .",
    "object 19 does not have such a large drop in magnitude ( @xmath01 ) , has a longer period of variability ( 145 day ) , and has lower amplitude ( @xmath00.05 mag ) .",
    "so it appears to have some of the same properties , but on a smaller scale , suggesting less dust formed .",
    "note that the presence of circumstellar dust is seen not only in the large infrared excesses , the infrared dust features , and the suggested dust - caused monotonic brightness trends , but also in the very red colors of some of these objects .",
    "while we do not have spectral types for most of them to permit us to determine the reddening in the individual objects , we note that ten of them are redder than ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) @xmath8 1.6 mag , with five of these having values larger than 2.0 mag .",
    "a supergiant would have to have a spectral type of k5 or later to be this red due to its photosphere , and hence there is a reddening of @xmath3 1 mag in ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) if these red stars are earlier than g5 .",
    "we also investigated whether there exists a correlation between the presence and strength of the 21 @xmath4 m emission feature with either pulsation period or temperature ( or spectral type ) .",
    "we have listed in table  [ results ] the presence and strength of the 21 @xmath4 m feature , as determined by @xcite , as either present ( y ) , weak ( w ) , questionable ( q ; which @xcite classified as very weak or questionable ) , or not present ( n ) . for the additional three objects added from the study by @xcite",
    ", we classified them similarly based on their spitzer spectra .",
    "the seven with a definite ( y ) 21 @xmath4 m features consist of three of the six with long periods ( 70@xmath1160 days ) and spitzer spectra , three of the five with medium timescale variability ( 10@xmath135 days ) , and only one of the nine with short timescale variability ( @xmath3110 days ) .",
    "the other eight with short timescale variations have weak ( 1 ) , questionable ( 2 ) , or no ( 5 ) 21 @xmath4 m feature .",
    "thus there appears to be a general correlation between the presence and strength of the 21 @xmath4 m feature and the pulsation timescale .",
    "those with long pulsation periods or medium timescale variability generally show a definite feature and those with short timescale variability possess no or a questionable 21 @xmath4 m feature .",
    "one can compare these results with what is seen in the mwg c - rich ppns .",
    "examining the presence and strengths of the 21 @xmath4 m feature with their periods for the mwg c - rich ppns , one sees that all 10 of those with long periods ( 70@xmath1160 days ) have a definite feature ( comparing the results of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , none of the three hot ( early b spectral type ) ppns classified as c - rich based on their spitzer spectra @xcite , and which all display short timescale variability @xcite , possesses a 21 @xmath4 m feature .",
    "a correlation also exists with temperature for these lmc / smc objects , although based on fewer objects .",
    "four of the five objects in the present study with cooler temperatures ( 5750@xmath16750 k ) and f@xmath1 g spectral types have a definite 21 @xmath4 m feature , while the two with known early spectral types ( nos . 9 and 21 )",
    "have no 21 @xmath4 m feature .",
    "a clear temperature effect has been seen for mwg ppns .",
    "the 21 @xmath4 m feature is almost solely detected in c - rich ppns of f@xmath1 g spectral types ( 5000@xmath18000 k ) and not in hot , early spectral type ppns ( see above ) or pns .",
    "it appears that the carrier of the 21 @xmath4 m emission feature is present in the environment of ppns of spectral type late - g to late - b , but that as the stars evolve to higher temperatures the carrier is either destroyed or is no longer excited in the same way .",
    "the correlation of the 21 @xmath4 m feature with the timescale of variability is simply the result of the period - temperature relationship discussed earlier .",
    "it seems surprising that so few of these c - rich , post - agb objects in the lmc / smc , eight ( or perhaps nine ) out of 22 , show periodic variability , while in the mwg almost all of those with carefully documented multi - year light curves do @xcite .",
    "in contrast , relatively large number these in the lmc have short - timescale variations .",
    "such short - timescale variations are also seen in the mwg , but only in hot , early b spectral type ppns and early - pns @xcite , of which there are only three clearly identified that are c - rich in the mwg .",
    "only two of these short - timescale lmc variables have a spectral type ( nos . 9 , 21 ) and they are classified hot stars ( b0.5  i(e ) , wc ? ) , in agreement with what is found in the mwg .",
    "we have used the information on periodicity and timescale of variability , temperature and spectral type , and the presence or absence of the 21 @xmath4 m feature , along with analogy with the ppns in the mwg , to classify the nature of the stars in the lmc / smc sample .",
    "we classify as ppns the eight with long periods , six of which have model atmosphere and abundances analyses that support this assignment .",
    "object 19 had once been classified as a young stellar object ( yso ) , but @xcite , in a large study of ysos based largely on their mid - infrared spectra , classified it as a non - yso , possibly a ppn . while we classify it as a ppn , we note that it does possess `` mild '' rcb - type drops in brightness . for a ppn , object 1",
    "has an unusually large luminosity , as noted by @xcite , but it is not above the limit for an agb star . the nine with short timescale variations of @xmath210 days we tentatively classify as hot ppns or young pns .",
    "two of these have spectral types that support this ( nos . 9 and 21 ; see table  [ results ] ) .",
    "the five with medium timescale variations , 10@xmath135 days , we also classify as ppns and suspect them to have spectral types of a to late - b .",
    "the two of these that have spectral types support this ( nos . 7 and 13 ; see table  [ var ] ) .",
    "future spectroscopic observations of the objects in these later two groups will help to confirm or refine these classifications .",
    "studies of ppns in the lmc and the mwg suggest a different spectral type number distribution between the two galaxies .",
    "@xcite noted that the number of so - called `` shell '' sources in their study of the lmc , which we would classify as ppn candidates , peaks at b spectral type .",
    "in the mwg the ppns , in general , peak in number at the f spectral types @xcite and the c - rich ones peak in number in the f - g spectral types @xcite .",
    "thus there appears to be a difference in the spectral type distribution of ppn candidates between the lmc and the mwg , with a much larger fraction in the lmc peaking at higher temperatures .",
    "our classification results appear to be consistent with this difference in the distribution of ppns . assuming the general correctness of our above classifications , they indicate , at least for c - rich objects , a significantly larger fraction of hot , early ( b ) spectral type ppns in the lmc and smc ( 9/22 ) compared to the fraction in the mwg ( 3/13 ; based on those with published spectrographic and variability studies ) .",
    "what could explain this difference in spectral type number distribution between the ppns in the lmc and mwg ?",
    "it could be that those in the lmc evolve more quickly during the early post - agb phase . a higher mass loss rate for those in the lmc would accomplish this , but we have no direct evidence of the rate of mass loss in these objects to support this .",
    "systematically higher masses for those in the lmc would also accomplish this , since higher mass objects evolve more quickly @xcite .",
    "we have investigated this by comparing their luminosities , since those with higher mass would be expected to have higher luminosities . @xcite and @xcite have calculated infrared fluxes for the 20 of these objects with spitzer irs spectra ( thus excluding objects 5 and 16 ) . @xcite calculate the flux in the 5@xmath137 @xmath4 m region , while @xcite also include estimations of the contribution at longer wavelengths and in the 2@xmath15 @xmath4 m region .",
    "comparisons were then made between six of these 20 objects with well - determined periods and mid - infrared spectra ( excluding objects 5 , and 16 ) , and both the nine that varied on short ( @xmath31 10 days ) timescales and the five that varied on medium ( 10@xmath135 days ) timescales ( see table  [ results ] , col .",
    "it is found that the average fluxes for those six with periods are significantly lower than the averages for the short or medium timescale groups .",
    "the flux ratios were 0.46 ( periodic / short ) , 0.71 ( periodic / medium ) , and 0.54 ( periodic/(short+medium ) ) .",
    "this flux difference suggests that those with the shorter timescale variability indeed have higher masses , which has led to their faster evolution to their early b spectral type range .",
    "however , their faster evolution to the b spectral types must be accompanied by a means to slow down the evolution in the b spectral type range . while the cause for such a later slowdown in evolution is not known",
    ", nevertheless , the fact remains that distribution of ppns in the lmc appears to peak at higher temperatures than it does in the mwg .",
    "it has also been found in general that the dust shell temperatures of the c - rich ppn candidates in the lmc are significantly higher than those in the mwg @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea previously suggested by @xcite , that the lmc stars evolved more quickly and that the dust shell is correspondingly closer to the star for a given spectral type .",
    "however , if the lmc ppns are more luminous , on average , then that could also contribute to the higher dust temperature .",
    "the inclusion of the above discussion is motivated by the tentative assignment of the short timescale lmc / smc variable objects as hot , early b spectral type ppns and early pns .",
    "spectroscopic observations to test this assignment are desirous , but will not be easy to obtain .",
    "only two of the short timescale variables without spectral classifications are brighter than _ v _ = 20 mag ; objects 7 and 16 have _ v _ @xmath7 16 mag .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the photometric variability of a sample of 22 c - rich ppns from the lmc and smc .",
    "we then compared them with a sample consisting of the majority of the know c - rich ppns in the mwg .",
    "the primary results are listed below .",
    "all 22 of these c - rich post - agb objects in the lmc / smc are found to vary in brightness .",
    "some show periodic variation and others show cyclical variation of a medium ( 10@xmath135 days ) or short ( less than few days ) timescale .",
    "some also show long - term trends in brightness over several years , although these are generally small compared to the maximum seasonal variations .",
    "periods were determined for eight of the objects , ranging from 157 to 49 days .",
    "these agree with the period range found for a sample of 12 c - rich ppns in the mwg , which ranged from 153 to 38 days @xcite .",
    "the eight periodic objects are each found to have multiple periods , ranging from two to four .",
    "this was expected from the light curves , which show strong modulation in the pulsation amplitudes suggestive of beat periods due to closely spaced periods .",
    "the secondary periods ( _ p@xmath18 _ ) determined are indeed close to the primary periods ( _ p@xmath11 _ ) , sometimes a little shorter and sometimes a little longer , with an average ratio of secondary to dominant of _ p@xmath18_/_p@xmath11 _ = 0.97 .",
    "correlations are found between the dominant pulsation period ( _ p@xmath11 _ ) and effective temperature ( _ t@xmath26 _ ) , with _",
    "p@xmath11 _ decreasing with increasing _ t@xmath26 _ , and between _ p@xmath11 _ and the pulsation amplitude , with amplitude decreasing with decreasing _",
    "p@xmath11_. again , these are in agreement with what is found for the sample of mwg objects , and they are what one would expect based on the evolution of stars in this ppn phase . however , for the _ p@xmath11_@xmath1_t@xmath26 _",
    "relationship , there is a suggestion that the lmc objects are shifted systematically to lower _ t@xmath26 _ and/or shorter _",
    "p@xmath11_. however , this tentative suggestion is based on only four objects .",
    "a correlation appears to exist between the presence of the 21 @xmath4 m spectral feature feature and both the pulsation timescale and the temperature ( or spectral type ) , although this is based on a small number of objects .",
    "those with long periods generally have a 21 @xmath4 m feature , as do the majority of those with medium timescale variability ( 10@xmath135 days ) , while those with short timescale variations do not .",
    "likewise , those with cooler temperatures and later spectral types tend to have the 21 @xmath4 m feature and the hotter objects do not .",
    "these are in agreement with the correlations found in the mwg ppns , and that are attributed to the temperature environment necessary to produce or maintain the carrier of the feature and to also excite it .",
    "the 14 without determined periods vary on a medium ( 5 ; 10@xmath135 days ) or short ( 9 ; @xmath31 10 days ) timescale .",
    "the short timescale is suggestive of hot ppns ( early b spectral types ) or young pns , since that is what has been found in the mwg . in the mwg",
    ", the majority of c - rich ppns have spectral types of f or g. in contrast , based on the above classification of the short timescale pulsators as hot ppns , the majority in the lmc appear to be hot ppns .",
    "the cause of this difference is uncertain , but it is suggested that they may evolve more quickly due to higher masses or higher mass loss rates",
    ". it would be useful to obtain spectroscopic observations of the brighter of these without determined periods to confirm the suggested spectral classifications as early - b spectral types .",
    "the two short timescale variables that do have spectral classifications are indeed both hot objects .",
    "one object ( j054054.31 - 693318.5 ) appears to show some rcb characteristics , but on a smaller scale .",
    "while the main period results are firm , the correlations with other physical parameters are less so .",
    "they would profit by the increase in the number of ppns with periods , in order to seek confirmation of the trend and of the suggested offset in _",
    "p_@xmath1_t@xmath26_. and they would also profit by the determination of spectral types for more of the objects , so that one can investigate with a larger sample the classification of the short timescale variables as hot , b spectral type objects .",
    "the discussion of the apparent differences in the spectral type distribution of ppns in the lmc and the mwg was predicated on this spectral classification of the short timescale variables .",
    "however , at present there are not good prospects to significantly enlarge this sample .",
    "we are lacking a facility such as _ spitzer _ that can obtain mid - infrared spectra to help identify such c - rich candidates .",
    "thus we must resort to techniques such as visible - band spectral searches of color - selected mid - infrared excess objects .",
    "a first step in this would be to obtain spectral types for the five objects in the present sample that lack temperature classifications that are brighter than _ v _ = 19 mag .",
    "this sample consists for two that have short timescale variations and three with medium timescale variations , with two in the later group showing definite evidence of the 21 @xmath4 m feature .",
