    "all polygons are required to remain flat during a deformation .",

    "kokotsakis @xcite , graf and sauer @xcite , and stachel @xcite described several types of flexible polyhedra . in @xcite a complete classification in the case of a quadrangular base was obtained .",
    "parametrization by elliptic functions is used in an essential way ; among the new flexible types there is an irreducible one , where the resultant of @xmath526 and @xmath527 is an irreducible polynomial and thus proportional to the resultant of @xmath528 and @xmath529 .",
    "qualitatively , all results of this article apply for quadrilaterals on the sphere or on the hyperbolic plane .",

    "it is not clear to us whether theorem [ thm : ivorysph ] is related to a version of ivory s theorem for hyperbolic spaces presented in @xcite .",
