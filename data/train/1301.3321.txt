    "maximum entropy models are an important class of statistical models for biology .",
    "for instance , they have been found to be a good model for protein folding @xcite , antibody diversity @xcite , neural population activity @xcite , and flock behavior @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop a general framework for studying maximum entropy distributions on weighted graphs , extending recent work of chatterjee , diaconis , and sly  @xcite .",
    "the development of this theory is partly motivated by the problem of sensory coding in neuroscience .    in the brain , information is represented by discrete electrical pulses , called _ action potentials _ or _ spikes _ @xcite .",
    "this includes neural representations of sensory stimuli which can take on a continuum of values .",
    "for instance , large photoreceptor arrays in the retina respond to a range of light intensities in a visual environment , but the brain does not receive information from these photoreceptors directly . instead , retinal ganglion cells must convey this detailed input to the visual cortex using only a series of binary electrical signals .",
    "continuous stimuli are therefore converted by networks of neurons to sequences of spike times .",
    "an unresolved controversy in neuroscience is whether information is contained in the precise timings of these spikes or only in their  rates \" ( i.e. , counts of spikes in a window of time ) .",
    "early theoretical studies @xcite suggest that information capacities of timing - based codes are superior to those that are rate - based ( also see @xcite for an implementation in a simple model ) .",
    "moreover , a number of scientific articles have appeared suggesting that precise spike timing @xcite and synchrony @xcite are important for various computations in the brain . here",
    ", we briefly explain a possible scheme for encoding continuous vectors with spiking neurons that takes advantage of precise spike timing and the mathematics of maximum entropy distributions .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 neurons in one region of the brain which transmits a continuous vector @xmath1 using sequences of spikes to a second receiver region .",
    "we assume that this second region contains a number of coincidence detectors that measure the absolute difference in spike times between pairs of neurons projecting from the first region .",
    "we imagine three scenarios for how information can be obtained by these detectors . in the first",
    ", the detector is only measuring for synchrony between spikes ; that is , either the detector assigns a 0 to a nonzero timing difference or a 1 to a coincidence of spikes . in another scenario",
    ", timing differences between projecting neurons can assume an infinite but countable number of possible values . finally ,",
    "in the third scenario , we allow these differences to take on any nonnegative real values .",
    "we further assume that neuronal output and thus spike times are stochastic variables .",
    "a basic question now arises : how can the first region encode @xmath2 so that it can be recovered robustly by the second ?",
    "we answer this question by first asking the one symmetric to this : how can the second region recover a real vector transmitted by an unknown sender region from spike timing measurements ?",
    "we propose the following possible solution to this problem .",
    "fix one of the detector mechanics as described above , and set @xmath3 to be the measurement of the absolute timing difference between spikes from projecting neurons @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the receiver population can compute the ( local ) sums @xmath6 efficiently .",
    "the values @xmath7 represent a weighted graph @xmath8 on @xmath0 vertices , and we assume that @xmath3 is randomly drawn from a distribution on timing measurements @xmath9 . making no further assumptions , a principle of jaynes @xcite suggests that the second region propose that the timing differences are drawn from the ( unique ) distribution over weighted graphs with the highest entropy @xcite having the vector @xmath10 for the expectations of the degree sums @xmath11 . depending on which of the three scenarios described above",
    "is true for the coincidence detector , this prescription produces one of three different maximum entropy distributions .",
    "consider the third scenario above ( the other cases are also subsumed by our results ) . as we shall see in section  [ sec : cont ] , the distribution determined in this case is parameterized by a real vector @xmath12 , and finding the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) for these parameters using @xmath13 as sufficient statistics boils down to solving the following set of @xmath0 algebraic equations in the @xmath0 unknowns @xmath14 : @xmath15 given our motivation , we call the system of equations   the _ retina equations _ for theoretical neuroscience , and note that they have been studied in a more general context by sanyal , sturmfels , and vinzant  @xcite using matroid theory and algebraic geometry . remarkably , a solution @xmath16 to   has the property that with high probability , it is arbitrarily close to the original parameters @xmath2 for sufficiently large network sizes @xmath0 ( in the scenario of binary measurements , this is a result of  @xcite ) . in particular , it is possible for the receiver region to recover reliably a continuous vector @xmath2 from a _ single _ cycle of neuronal firing emanating from the sender region .",
    "we now know how to answer our first question : _ the sender region should arrange spike timing differences to come from a maximum entropy distribution_. we remark that this conclusion is consistent with modern paradigms in theoretical neuroscience and artificial intelligence , such as the concept of the boltzmann machine @xcite , a stochastic version of its ( zero - temperature ) deterministic limit , the little - hopfield network @xcite .

    "<S> inspired by the problem of sensory coding in neuroscience , we study the maximum entropy distribution on weighted graphs with a given expected degree sequence . this distribution on graphs is characterized by independent edge weights parameterized by vertex potentials at each node . using the general theory of exponential family distributions , we prove the existence and uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of the vertex parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove the consistency of the mle from a single graph sample , extending the results of chatterjee , diaconis , and sly for unweighted ( binary ) graphs . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our extensions require an intricate study of the inverses of diagonally dominant positive matrices . along the way </S>",
    "<S> , we derive analogues of the erds - gallai criterion of graphical sequences for weighted graphs . </S>"
