    "the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) will soon be probed directly at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "one logical possibility is that the sector responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking will involve new , nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "historically , technicolor models have represented an attempt at constructing viable theories of this type  @xcite .",
    "conventional technicolor models , however , suffer from a number of well - known problems .",
    "as originally proposed , the technicolor sector was assumed to be a scaled - up version of qcd , leading to estimates for the @xmath0 parameter that are unacceptably large  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an extended technicolor ( etc ) sector must be added to generate the operators needed to account for standard model fermion masses  @xcite . in many etc models , it is impossible to account for a heavy top quark ( which requires the etc scale to be low ) and suppress other etc operators that contribute to flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes ( which requires the etc scale to be high ) .",
    "viable and elegant etc models have been few and far between .",
    "developments over the last decade in the physics of higher - dimensional and conformal field theories , however , have led to new possibilities in technicolor model building  @xcite .",
    "for example , the magnitude of the @xmath0 parameter in qcd - like technicolor theories suggests one should not exclusively study theories that are exactly like qcd ( as , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "a decade or so ago , this would have been a fruitless effort .",
    "now , the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite provides a means of constructing a perturbative , five - dimensional ( 5d ) theory that is dual to a strongly coupled technicolor theory localized on a four - dimensional ( 4d ) boundary  @xcite . for some values of the parameters that define the 5d theory ,",
    "the dual theory can model a scaled - up version of qcd .",
    "however , for other parameter choices it does not . in either case ,",
    "observables can be computed reliably in the 5d theory , which we can think of as defining its strongly coupled dual .",
    "the freedom to deviate from the qcd - like limit only presumes the validity of a gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "the evidence for this is not insignificant , and includes holographic models of qcd phenomenology that agree remarkably well with the low - energy data  @xcite .",
    "the problem with fermion mass generation in the conventional etc framework , on the other hand , may suggest something about the form of the relevant low - energy effective theory .",
    "it was observed long ago that a techniquark bound state with the same quantum numbers as a standard model higgs doublet can form in etc models in which the etc gauge coupling becomes strong  @xcite ; this bound state has yukawa couplings to the standard model fermions and may develop a vacuum expectation value , producing fermion masses .",
    "the low - energy effective theory , taken by itself , has no problems with fcnc effects , since these originate from scalar - exchange diagrams that are no larger than in conventional two - higgs doublet models . a significant number of phenomenological studies on such ",
    "bosonic technicolor \" scenarios were motivated by the simplicity of this low - energy effective theory  @xcite . while bosonic technicolor can arise from a ( fine - tuned ) strongly coupled etc model , the low - energy effective theory is by no means linked uniquely to that ultraviolet completion .",
    "for example , the same effective theory can arise in a warped , 5d theory with a higgs field localized near the planck brane and symmetry - breaking boundary conditions on the bulk gauge fields  @xcite . in this setting",
    ", the presence of a scalar in the spectrum of the theory seems far from scandalous .",
    "the value of working with the low - effective effective description is that one can extract robust , low - energy predictions of the theory without being hindered unnecessarily by one s ignorance of the physics that has decoupled in the ultraviolet .",
    "it is such robust predictions of the low - energy effective theory that are of interest to us in this paper . using the holographic approach to define our strongly coupled sector , and the associated freedom to deviate from the limit in which this sector is like qcd",
    ", we show that the parameter space of the theory is nonetheless significantly constrained . combining the bounds on the @xmath0 parameter ( evaluated holographically ) , partial - wave unitarity in longitudinal @xmath1 boson scattering ( with the technirho couplings evaluated holographically ) and the bound on the mass of the light higgs - like scalar ( with a relevant chiral lagrangian parameter evaluated holographically )",
    ", we find that there is a relatively narrow region of parameter space in which the model is currently viable . in deforming the theory away from its qcd - like limit , we focus primarily on varying the ratio of the chiral symmetry breaking to the confinement scale , as well as the amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking originating from the current techniquark masses .",
    "in addition , bosonic technicolor models allow one to vary the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strongly interacting sector , while holding the electroweak scale fixed . within the allowed parameter region , the ranges of observable quantities",
    "are substantially restricted , suggesting the qualitative features of the model that may be relevant at the lhc .",
    "the new results presented here suggest that the simplest version of holographic bosonic technicolor may be sufficiently constrained that upcoming collider data could soon render debates on the possible origins of the effective theory largely irrelevant .",
