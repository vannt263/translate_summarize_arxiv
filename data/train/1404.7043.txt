    "geometric group theory was born in low - dimensional topology , in the collective visions of klein , poincar and dehn .",
    "stallings used key ideas from 3-manifold topology ( dehn s lemma , the sphere theorem ) to prove theorems about free groups , and as a model for how to think about groups geometrically in general .",
    "the pillars of modern geometric group theory  ( relatively ) hyperbolic groups and hyperbolic dehn filling , npc cube complexes and their relations to lerf , the theory of jsj splittings of groups and the structure of limit groups  all have their origins in the geometric and topological theory of 2- and 3-manifolds .    despite these substantial and deep connections ,",
    "the role of 3-manifolds in the larger world of group theory has been mainly to serve as a source of examples  of specific groups , and of rich and important phenomena and structure .",
    "surfaces ( especially riemann surfaces ) arise naturally throughout all of mathematics ( and throughout science more generally ) , and are as ubiquitous as the complex numbers .",
    "but the conventional view is surely that 3-manifolds _ per se _ do not spontaneously arise in other areas of geometry ( or mathematics more broadly ) amongst the _ generic _ objects of study .",
    "we challenge this conventional view : 3-manifolds are everywhere .",
    "the `` generic '' objects in the world of finitely presented groups are the _ random _ groups , in the sense of gromov .",
    "there are two models of what one means by a random group , and we shall briefly discuss them both .    first , fix @xmath0 and fix a free generating set @xmath1 for @xmath2 , a free group of rank @xmath3 .",
    "a @xmath3-generator group @xmath4 can be given by a presentation @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are cyclically reduced cyclic words in the @xmath7 and their inverses .",
    "in the _ few relators model _ of a random group , one fixes @xmath8 , and then for a given integer @xmath9 , selects the @xmath6 independently and randomly ( with the uniform distribution ) from the set of all reduced cyclic words of length @xmath9 .    in the _ density model _ of a random group , one fixes @xmath10 , and then for a given integer @xmath9 , define @xmath11 and select the @xmath6 independently and randomly ( with the uniform distribution ) from the set of all reduced cyclic words of length @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the difference between the two models is how the number of relations ( @xmath12 ) depends on their length ( @xmath9 ) . in the few relators model ,",
    "the absolute number of relations is fixed , whereas in the density model , the ( logarithmic ) density of the relations among all words of the given length is fixed .    for fixed @xmath13 in the few relators model , or fixed @xmath14 in the density model ,",
    "we obtain in this way a probability distribution on finitely presented groups ( actually , on finite presentations ) . for some property of groups of interest",
    ", the property will hold for a random group with some probability depending on @xmath9 .",
    "we say that the property holds for a random group _ with overwhelming probability _ if the probability goes to 1 as @xmath9 goes to infinity .",
    "as remarked above , a `` random group '' really means a `` random presentation '' .",
    "associated to a finite presentation of a group @xmath4 as above , one can build a 2-complex @xmath15 with one 0 cell , with one 1 cell for each generator @xmath7 , and with one 2 cell for each relation @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 .",
    "we are very interested in the geometry and combinatorics of @xmath15 ( and its universal cover ) in what follows .",
    "all few - relator random groups are alike ( with overwhelming probability ) .",
    "there is a _ phase transition _ in the behavior of density random groups , discovered by gromov ( @xcite   9 ) : for @xmath18 , a random group is either trivial or isomorphic to @xmath19 , whereas at any fixed density @xmath20 , a random group is infinite , hyperbolic , and 1-ended , and the presentation determining the group is _ aspherical _",
    " i.e. the 2-complex @xmath15 defined from the presentation has contractible universal cover .",
    "furthermore , dahmani  guirardel  przytycki @xcite showed that a random group with density less than a half does not split , and has boundary homeomorphic to the _ menger sponge_.",
    "the menger sponge is obtained from the unit cube by subdividing it into 27 smaller cubes each with one third the side length , then removing the central cube and the six cubes centered on each face ; and then inductively performing the same procedure with each of the remaining 20 smaller cubes ; see figure  [ sponge ] .",
    "the menger sponge has topological dimension 1 , and is the _ universal _ compact space with this property , in the sense that any compact hausdorff space of topological dimension 1 embeds in it .",
    "it is important to understand what kinds of abstract groups @xmath21 arise as subgroups of a random group @xmath4 . however , not all subgroups of a hyperbolic group are of equal importance : the most useful subgroups , and those that tell us the most about the geometry of @xmath4 , are the subgroups @xmath21 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "the group @xmath21 itself is something whose intrinsic topological and geometric properties we understand very well ; and 2 .",
    "the intrinsic geometry of @xmath21 can be uniformly compared with the extrinsic geometry of its embedding in @xmath4 .    in other words , we are interested in well - understood groups @xmath21 which are quasi - isometrically embedded in @xmath4 .    a finitely generated quasi - isometrically embedded subgroup @xmath21 of a hyperbolic group @xmath4",
    "is itself hyperbolic , and therefore finitely presented .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath21 into @xmath4 induces an embedding of gromov boundaries @xmath22 . thus if @xmath4 is a random group , the boundary of @xmath21 has dimension at most 1 , and by work of kapovich ",
    "kleiner @xcite , there is a hierarchical description of all possible @xmath23 .",
    "first of all , if @xmath23 is disconnected , then one knows by stallings @xcite that @xmath21 splits over a finite group .",
    "second of all , if @xmath23 is connected and contains a local cut point , then one knows by bowditch @xcite that either @xmath21 is virtually a surface group , or else @xmath21 splits over a cyclic group .",
    "thus , apart from the menger sponge itself , understanding hyperbolic groups with boundary of dimension at most 1 reduces ( in some sense ) to the case that @xmath23 is a cantor set , a circle , or a _ sierpinski carpet _  i.e. one of the `` faces '' of the menger cube .",
    "the sierpinski carpet is universal for 1-dimensional compact hausdorff _ planar",
    "_ sets of topological dimension 1 .",
    "thus one is naturally led to the following fundamental question , which as far as we know was first asked explicitly by franois dahmani :    which of the three spaces  cantor set , circle , sierpinski carpet  arise as the boundary of a quasiconvex subgroup of a random group ?    combining the main theorem of this paper with the results of @xcite gives a complete answer to this question :    _ all three _ spaces arise in a random group as the boundary of a quasiconvex subgroup ( with overwhelming probability ) .",
    "this is true in the few relators model with any positive number of relators , or the density model at any density less than a half .",
    "the situation is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath23 is a cantor set if and only if @xmath21 is virtually free ( of rank at least 2 ) ; we can thus take @xmath24 .",
    "the existence of free quasiconvex subgroups @xmath21 in arbitrary ( nonelementary ) hyperbolic groups @xmath4 is due to klein , by the ping - pong argument .",
    "@xmath23 is a circle if and only if @xmath21 is virtually a surface group ( of genus at least 2 ) ; we can thus take @xmath25 . the existence of surface subgroups @xmath21 in random groups ( with overwhelming probability ) is proved by calegari ",
    "walker @xcite , theorem  6.4.1 . 3 .",
    "@xmath23 is a sierpinski carpet if @xmath21 is virtually the fundamental group of a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold with ( nonempty ) totally geodesic boundary ; and if the cannon conjecture is true , this is if and only if  see @xcite .",
    "the existence of such 3-manifold subgroups @xmath21 in random groups ( with overwhelming probability ) is theorem  [ theorem : random_acylindrical_subgroup ] in this paper .",
    "explicitly , we prove :    fix @xmath0 . a random @xmath3-generator group",
    " either in the few relators model with @xmath8 relators , or the density model with density @xmath20  and relators of length @xmath9 contains many quasi - isometrically embedded subgroups isomorphic to the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold with totally geodesic boundary , with probability @xmath26 for some @xmath27 .",
    "our theorem applies in particular in the few relators model where @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , if one fixes @xmath29 , and starts with a random 1-relator group @xmath30 , one can construct a quasiconvex 3-manifold subgroup @xmath21 ( of the sort which is guaranteed by the theorem ) which stays injective and quasiconvex ( with overwhelming probability ) as a further @xmath31 relators are added .",
    "two groups are said to be _",
    "commensurable _ if they have isomorphic subgroups of finite index .",
    "commensurability is an equivalence relation , and it is natural to wonder what commensurability classes of 3-manifold groups arise in a random group .",
    "we are able to put very strong constraints on the commensurability classes of the 3-manifold groups we construct .",
    "it is probably too much to hope to be able to construct a subgroup of a _ fixed _",
    "commensurability class .",
    "but we can arrange for our 3-manifold groups to be commensurable with some element of a family of finitely generated groups given by presentations which differ only by varying the order of torsion of a specific element .",
    "hence our 3-manifold subgroups are all commensurable with kleinian groups of bounded convex covolume ( i.e. the convex hulls of the quotients have uniformly bounded volume ) . explicitly :    a random group at any density @xmath32 or in the few relators model contains ( with overwhelming probability ) a subgroup commensurable with the coxeter group @xmath33 for some @xmath34 , where @xmath33 is the coxeter group with coxeter diagram    ( 70,10)(0,0 ) ( 5,5 ) ( 35,5 ) ( 65,5 ) ( 95,5 ) ( 5,5)(1,0)90 ( 16,9)@xmath35    the coxeter group @xmath33 is commensurable with the group generated by reflections in the sides of a regular _ super ideal _ tetrahedron  one with vertices `` outside '' the sphere at infinity  and with dihedral angles @xmath36 .",
    "we now describe the outline of the paper .    as discussed above , our random groups @xmath4 come together with the data of a finite presentation @xmath37 from such a presentation we can build in a canonical way a 2-complex @xmath15 with 1-skeleton @xmath38 , where @xmath38 is a wedge of @xmath3 circles , and @xmath15",
    "is obtained by attaching @xmath12 disks along loops in @xmath38 corresponding to the relators ; so @xmath39 .",
    "our 3-manifold subgroups arise as the fundamental groups of 2-complexes @xmath40 that come with immersions @xmath41 taking cells of @xmath40 homeomorphically to cells of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , for every 2-cell of @xmath40 , the attaching map of its boundary to the 1-skeleton @xmath42 factors through a map onto one of the relators of the given presentation of @xmath4 .    one way to obtain such a complex @xmath40 is to build a 1-complex @xmath42 as a quotient of a collection @xmath43 of circles together with an immersion @xmath44 where @xmath38 is the 1-skeleton of @xmath15 , and the map @xmath45 takes each component to the image of a relator .",
    "we call data of this kind a _ spine_. in ",
    "[ section : spines ] we describe the topology of spines and give sufficient combinatorial conditions on a spine to ensure that @xmath40 is homotopic to a 3-manifold .    in   [ section : thin_spine_section ]",
    "we prove the thin spine theorem , which says that we can build such a spine @xmath46 , satisfying the desired combinatorial conditions , and such that every edge of the 1-skeleton @xmath42 is _",
    "long_. here we measure the length of edges of @xmath42 by pulling back length from @xmath38 under the immersion @xmath47 , where each edge of @xmath38 is normalized to have length @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , if we let @xmath49 denote the 1-relator group @xmath50 with associated 2-complex @xmath51 which comes with a tautological inclusion @xmath52 , then our thin spines have the property that the immersion @xmath41 factors through @xmath53 .    for technical reasons , rather than working with a random relator @xmath54 , we work instead with a relator which is merely sufficiently _ pseudorandom _ ( a condition concerning equidistribution of subwords with controlled error on certain scales ) , and the theorem we prove is deterministic . of course , the definition of pseudorandom is such that a random word will be pseudorandom with very high probability .",
    "explicitly , we prove :    for any @xmath55 there is @xmath56 and @xmath57 so that , if @xmath58 is @xmath59-pseudorandom and @xmath15 is the 2-complex associated to the presentation @xmath60 , then there is a spine @xmath61 over @xmath15 for which @xmath43 is a union of 216 circles ( or 1,944 circles if @xmath62 ) , and every edge of @xmath42 has length at least @xmath63 .",
    "this is by far the longest section in the paper , and it involves a complicated combinatorial argument with many interdependent steps .",
    "it should be remarked that one of the key ideas we exploit in this section is the method of _ random matching with correction _ : randomness ( actually , pseudorandomness ) is used to show that the desired combinatorial construction can be performed _ with very small error_. in the process , we build a _ reservoir _ of small independent pieces which may be adjusted by various local moves in such a way as to `` correct '' the errors that arose at the random matching step .",
    "similar ideas were also used by kahn ",
    "markovic @xcite in their proof of the ehrenpreis conjecture , by calegari  walker @xcite in their construction of surface subgroups in random groups , and by keevash @xcite in his construction of general steiner systems and designs .",
    "evidently this method is extremely powerful , and its full potential is far from being exhausted .",
    "the thin spine theorem can be summarized by saying that as a graph , @xmath42 has bounded valence , but very long edges .",
    "this means that the image of @xmath64 in @xmath65 induced by the inclusion @xmath44 is very `` sparse '' , in the sense that the ball of radius @xmath9 in @xmath65 contains @xmath66 elements of @xmath64 , where we can take @xmath63 as big as we like .",
    "this has the following consequence : when we obtain @xmath49 as a quotient of @xmath65 by adding @xmath54 as a relator , we should not kill any `` accidental '' elements of @xmath64 , so that the image of @xmath64 will be isomorphic to @xmath67 , a 3-manifold group .",
    "this idea is fleshed out in ",
    "[ bead_decomposition_section ] , and shows that random 1-relator groups contain 3-manifold subgroups , although at this stage we have not yet shown that the 3-manifold is of the desired form .",
    "the argument in this section depends on a so - called _ bead decomposition _ , which is very closely analogous to the bead decomposition used to construct surface groups by calegari ",
    "walker in @xcite , and the proof is very similar .    in ",
    "[ acylindricity_section ] we show that the 3-manifold homotopic to the 2-complex @xmath40 is acylindrical ; equivalently , that it is homeomorphic to a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold with totally geodesic boundary .",
    "this is a step with no precise analog in @xcite , but the argument is very similar to the argument showing that @xmath40 is injective in the 1-relator group @xmath68 .",
    "there are two kinds of annuli to rule out : those that use 2-cells of @xmath40 , and those that do nt .",
    "the annuli without 2-cells are ruled out by the combinatorics of the construction .",
    "those that use 2-cells are ruled out by a small cancellation argument which uses the thinness of the spine .",
    "so at the end of this section , we have shown that random 1-relator groups contain subgroups isomorphic to the fundamental groups of compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary .    finally , in   [ endgame_section ]",
    ", we show that the subgroup @xmath67 stays injective as the remaining @xmath69 random relators are added .",
    "the argument here stays extremely close to the analogous argument in @xcite , and depends ( as @xcite did ) on a kind of small cancellation theory for random groups developed by ollivier @xcite .",
    "this concludes the proof of the main theorem .",
    "a further section ",
    "[ section : commensurability ] proves the commensurability theorem .",
    "the proof is straightforward given the technology developed in the earlier sections .",
    "before introducing spines , we first motivate them by describing the analogous , but simpler , theory of fatgraphs .",
    "a _ fatgraph _ @xmath70 is a ( simplicial ) graph together with a cyclic ordering of the edges incident to each vertex .",
    "this cyclic ordering can be used to canonically `` fatten '' the graph @xmath70 so that it embeds in an oriented surface @xmath71 with boundary , in such a way that @xmath71 deformation retracts down to @xmath70 . under this deformation retraction , the boundary @xmath72 maps to @xmath70 in such a way that the preimage of each edge @xmath73 of @xmath70 consists of two intervals @xmath74 in @xmath72 , each mapping homeomorphically to @xmath73 , with opposite orientations .",
    "abstractly , the data of a fatgraph can be given by an ordinary graph @xmath70 , a 1-manifold @xmath43 , and a locally injective simplicial map @xmath75 of ( geometric ) `` degree 2 '' ; i.e. such that each edge of @xmath70 is in the image of two intervals in @xmath43 .",
    "the surface @xmath71 arises as the mapping cone of @xmath76 . if one orients @xmath43 and insists that the preimages of each edge have opposite orientations , the result is a fatgraph and an oriented surface as above . if one does not insist on the orientation condition , the mapping cone need not be orientable . attaching a disk along its boundary to each component of @xmath43 produces a _ closed _",
    "surface , which we denote @xmath77 .",
    "we would like to discuss a more complicated object called a _",
    "for which the analog of @xmath77 is a 2-complex homotopy equivalent to a compact 3-manifold with boundary .",
    "the 2-complex will arise by gluing 2-dimensional disks onto the components of a 1-manifold @xmath43 , and then attaching these disks to the mapping cone of an immersion @xmath61 where @xmath42 is a 4-valent graph , and the map @xmath76 is subject to certain local combinatorial constraints .",
    "the first combinatorial constraint is that the map @xmath61 should be `` degree 3 '' ; that is , the preimage of each edge of @xmath43 should consist of three disjoint intervals in @xmath43 , each mapped homeomorphically by @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath42 is 4-valent , at each vertex @xmath78 of @xmath42 we have 12 intervals in @xmath43 that map to the incident edges ; these 12 intervals should be obtained by subdividing 6 disjoint intervals in @xmath43 , where the dividing point maps to @xmath78 . since @xmath46 is an immersion , near each dividing point the given interval in @xmath43 runs locally from one edge incident to @xmath78 to a different one .",
    "there are three local models ( up to symmetry ) of how six edges of @xmath43 can locally run over a 4-valent vertex @xmath78 of @xmath42 so that they run over each incident edge ( in @xmath42 ) to @xmath78 three times ( this notion of `` local model '' is frequently called a _ whitehead graph _ in the literature ) .",
    "these three local models are illustrated in figure  [ local_model ] .",
    "@xmath79 at -200 0     the third local model is distinguished by the property that for each pair of edges of @xmath42 adjacent to @xmath78 , there is exactly one interval in @xmath43 running over @xmath78 from one edge to the other .",
    "we say that such a local model is _",
    "good_. the second combinatorial constraint is that the local model at every vertex of @xmath42 is good .    if @xmath61 is good , and @xmath80 is the mapping cone of @xmath76 , then the 2-complex @xmath80 can be canonically thickened to a 3-manifold , since a neighborhood of the mapping cone near a vertex @xmath78 embeds in @xmath81 in such a way that the tetrahedral symmetry of the combinatorics is realized by symmetries of the embedding .",
    "similarly , along each edge the dihedral symmetry is realized by the symmetry of the embedding .",
    "the restriction of this thickening to each component of @xmath43 is the total space of an @xmath82-bundle over the circle ; we say that @xmath61 is _ co - oriented _ if each of these @xmath82-bundles is trivial .",
    "the third combinatorial constraint is that @xmath61 is co - oriented .",
    "[ definition : spine ] a _ spine _ is the data of a compact 1-manifold @xmath43 and a 4-valent graph @xmath42 , together with a co - oriented degree 3 immersion @xmath61 whose local model at every vertex of @xmath42 is good .",
    "if @xmath61 is a spine , we denote the mapping cone by @xmath80 , and by @xmath40 the 2-complex obtained by capping each component of @xmath43 in @xmath80 off by a disk .",
    "[ lemma : spine_thickens ] let @xmath61 be a spine .",
    "then @xmath40 is canonically homotopy equivalent to a compact 3-manifold with boundary .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath80 has a canonical thickening to a compact 3-manifold in such a way that the restriction of this thickening to each component of @xmath43 is an @xmath82-bundle .",
    "the total space of this @xmath82-bundle is an annulus embedded in the boundary of @xmath80 , and we may therefore attach a 2-handle with core the corresponding component of @xmath43 providing this @xmath82-bundle is trivial .",
    "but that is exactly the condition that @xmath61 should be co - oriented .    by abuse of notation ,",
    "we call @xmath40 the _ thickening _ of @xmath42",
    ".      now let s fix @xmath0 and a free group @xmath2 on @xmath3 fixed generators .",
    "let @xmath38 be a rose for @xmath2 ; i.e. a wedge of @xmath3 ( oriented ) circles , with a given labeling by the generators of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a random group ( in whatever model ) at length @xmath9 .",
    "each relator @xmath6 is a cyclically reduced word in @xmath2 , and is realized geometrically by an immersion of an oriented circle @xmath83 .",
    "attaching a disk along each such circle gives rise to the 2-complex @xmath15 described in the introduction with @xmath39 .",
    "a spine _ over @xmath15 _ is a spine @xmath61 together with an immersion @xmath84 such that for each component @xmath85 of @xmath43 , there is some relator @xmath16 and a simplicial homeomorphism @xmath86 for which @xmath87 .",

    "so we can equivalently think of the labels as living on the oriented edges of @xmath42 .",

    "if this spine is over @xmath15 , then each component of @xmath43 has length @xmath107 , and if we make no assumptions about the value of @xmath107 mod 3 , then it will be necessary in general for the number of components of @xmath43 to be divisible by 3 .",

    "the fibre product @xmath333 of the maps @xmath332 and @xmath319 , together with the induced map @xmath334 , will then describe various gluing patterns for ( covering spaces of ) unions of bubbles .",

    "we next calculate the restriction of @xmath341 to @xmath326 : @xmath347 while @xmath348 the covering space of @xmath317 corresponding to the restriction of @xmath341 is therefore a bizene .",

    "the reason is that in a uniform set of cube types ( i.e. all possible assignments of compatible labels of length @xmath358 to edges of a cube ) , the set of football types that appear is not quite equidistributed  it differs multiplicatively from the uniform distribution by approximately @xmath359 .",
    "so it is easiest just to arrange in advance for the distribution of football types to match the distribution appearing in the uniform distribution of cubes , by using the method of ",
    "[ subsection : distribution ] .",
    "this gets to within @xmath103 of the desired distribution ; then we apply tear moves to the remainder , and glue up the resulting bicrowns and bizenes with a small fraction of the mass of footballs .",
    "finally we adjust the mass of footballs with trades to correct the remaining error , and glue everything up with cube moves .      to complete the proof of the thin spine theorem , we need to glue up the remaining small mass ( of order @xmath360 ) of bizenes and bicrowns using prism moves , before gluing up the remaining bizenes using cube moves .",
    "we shall see that trades provide us with enough flexibility to do this , as long as @xmath101 is large enough . however ,",
    "since prism moves require that bizenes are glued up with bizenes and our bicrowns are glued up with bicrowns , and yet the reservoir consists only of football bubbles , we will need a move that turns football bubbles into bizenes and bicrowns of given types .      since the bicrowns that we need to assemble are all of covering type , it is straightforward to construct them from football bubbles",
    ". given a bicrown of covering type @xmath296 , covering a football bubble of type @xmath195 , there is a move which takes as input three identical triples of bubbles each of type @xmath195 , and transforms them into three bicrowns of type @xmath296 , without any other changes to the unglued subgraph .",
    "the following lemma is an immediate consequence of the fact that a 12-prism triply covers a cube .",
    "[ lem : gluing bicrowns ] for every bicrown of covering type there exist three more bicrowns of covering type such that the four bicrowns together can be glued with a 12-prism move .",

    "we assemble bizenes using the following move .",
    "consider an adjacent pair of bubbles of type @xmath293 and @xmath361 , separated by a sticky strip of type @xmath136 .",
    "suppose also that the second bubble ( of type @xmath361 ) is followed by a further sticky strip also of type @xmath136 .",
    "consider also a second pair of bubbles , of the same type but with the two bubbles swapped . from these two pairs we may construct two bizenes of the same type .",
    "the pairs of edges with the same start and end points are labeled @xmath362 and @xmath363 , while the edges joining one pair to the other are labeled @xmath295 and @xmath364 .",
    "the bizenes that we may assemble in this way satisfy some constraints , arising from the fact that both the ends of the following triples must all be compatible with the start of @xmath136 : @xmath293 , @xmath361 , @xmath365 , @xmath366 . in the rank - two case , this creates especially strong constraints , which ( up to relabeling ) can be simply stated as requiring that the ends of @xmath294 , @xmath291 and @xmath295 should be equal to the ends of @xmath367 , @xmath368 and @xmath364 respectively .",
    "we shall call such a bizene _ constructible_.    just as the bizenes that we can construct are constrained , so the bizenes that we need to glue up from the remainder are also of a special form .",

    "cubical distribution_. in particular , if @xmath370 is the uniform distribution on the set of types of cubes then we call the push forward the _ uniform cubical distribution _ , or just the _ cube distribution",
    "_ for brevity .",
    "in subsection [ subsection : distribution ] above we may take @xmath207 to be the cube distribution , so that the set of football bubbles in the reservoir @xmath254 is within @xmath175 of @xmath214 , a distribution proportional to the cube distribution .",
    "we next address the distribution @xmath238 from lemma [ lemma : trades ] .",
    "it consists of two parts : any cubical distribution @xmath370 , and a _ bizene correction distribution _ @xmath371 .",
    "that is , @xmath372 .",

    "the difference between a given framing and the move framing determines a class in @xmath406 for each piece , and the sum over all such pieces is the ( global ) co - orientation cocycle in @xmath404 .",

    "so it is probably hopeless to try to understand _ precisely _ which subgroups arise , since this will depend in a very complicated way on the length @xmath9 of the relators .",
    "however , we are in better shape if we simply try to control the _ commensurability class _ of the subgroups .    there are 24 simplices in the barycentric subdivision of a regular euclidean tetrahedron .",
    "three edges of this simplex have dihedral angles @xmath578 , two have dihedral angles @xmath579 , and one ( the edge lying on the edge of the original simplex ) has a dihedral angle of the form @xmath580 , which is approximately @xmath581 . if we deform the dihedral angle @xmath400 of this last edge while keeping the other dihedral angles fixed , the simplex admits a unique hyperbolic metric for all @xmath582 at which point one vertex of the simplex becomes ideal .",
    "if we try to deform to @xmath583 , then three of the faces of the simplex do nt meet at all , and there is a perpendicular plane which intersects these three faces in the edges of a hyperbolic triangle with angles @xmath584",
    ". if @xmath400 is of the form @xmath36 for some integer @xmath585 , the group generated by reflections in the 4 sides of the ( now - infinite ) hyperbolic polyhedron is discrete , and convex cocompact .",
    "this group is a coxeter group which we denote @xmath33 , and whose coxeter diagram is    ( 70,10)(0,0 ) ( 5,5 ) ( 35,5 ) ( 65,5 ) ( 95,5 ) ( 5,5)(1,0)90 ( 16,9)@xmath35    the groups @xmath33 with @xmath586 are finite .",
    "the group @xmath587 is commensurable with the fundamental group of the figure 8 knot complement . for any @xmath34 the limit set of @xmath33",
    "is a ( round ) sierpinski carpet . figure  [ 7fold_carpet ] depicts a simply - connected 2-complex @xmath588 stabilized by @xmath589 with cocompact fundamental domain which is a `` dual '' spine to the ( infinite ) polyhedron described above .",
    "the faces of this 2-complex are regular 7-gons , and the vertices are all 4-valent with tetrahedral symmetry",

    "the convex covolumes of @xmath33  i.e. the volumes of the convex hulls of @xmath592  are uniformly bounded above independently of @xmath35 .",
    "we now observe that we can arrange for the 3-manifold groups we construct to be commensurable with some @xmath33 .",
    "[ theorem : commensurability_theorem ] a random group at any density @xmath32 or in the few relators model contains ( with overwhelming probability ) a subgroup commensurable with the coxeter group @xmath33 for some @xmath34 , where @xmath33 is the coxeter group with coxeter diagram    ( 70,10)(0,0 ) ( 5,5 ) ( 35,5 ) ( 65,5 ) ( 95,5 ) ( 5,5)(1,0)90 ( 16,9)@xmath35    the group @xmath33 acts cocompactly on a simply - connected 2-dimensional complex @xmath588 in @xmath593 whose faces are totally geodesic regular hyperbolic @xmath35-gons , and whose vertices are 4-valent and are stabilized by a tetrahedral symmetry group ; the case @xmath594 is depicted in figure  [ 7fold_carpet ] .",
    "so to prove the theorem it suffices to show that we can build our thin spines @xmath46 in such a way that each component of @xmath43 maps over exactly @xmath35 edges of the 4-valent graph @xmath42 .",
    "but this is elementary to arrange : the only point in the construction in which the number of edges of the components of @xmath43 might vary is during the operations of super - compatible gluing , the adjustments in   [ subsection : distribution ] , and trades . in each of these cases all that is relevant",
    "is the types of pieces being glued or traded , and not which components of @xmath43 are involved . since types of the desired kind for each move can be found on any component , we can simply distribute the moves evenly over the different components , possibly after taking multiple copies of @xmath43 to clear denominators .",
    "the proof immediately follows    there is nothing very special about the commensurability classes @xmath33 , except that their fundamental domains are so small , so that their local combinatorics are very easy to describe .    a _ geodesic spine _",
    "@xmath15 is a finite 2-dimensional complex with totally geodesic edges and faces which embeds in some hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath595 with totally geodesic boundary as a deformation retract .",
