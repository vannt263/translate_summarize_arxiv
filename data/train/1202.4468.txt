    "low - mass stars ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) represent the largest fraction of the stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "the availability of a reliable theoretical mass  radius relationship is of considerable interest both _",
    "per se _ and in view of the application to the study of exoplanet - hosting stars .",
    "moreover , below about @xmath9 , the depth of the subsurface convection zone extends enough to reach the centre and stars become fully convective ( hereafter fc ) .",
    "this new regime has peculiar characteristics and presents additional challenges . in constructing theoretical models of fc stars ,",
    "special care is required in handling all the main input physics ingredients , such as the equation of state , the opacities , and the atmospheric boundary conditions , due to the lower temperature and higher density regime ( see the reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although convection becomes very efficient at quite shallow depths ( i.e. @xmath10 at @xmath11 , see e.g. section  7.3.3 of @xcite ) , it is still necessary to rely on the mixing length theory ( mlt , @xcite ) for the convective transport in the outermost layers and in the atmosphere , which can have a significant impact on the global structure parameters @xcite .",
    "double - lined eclipsing binary systems ( hereafter ebs ) provide very accurate determination of the fundamental parameters of stars , allowing to test theoretical model predictions .",
    "there is mounting evidence that low - mass stars in ebs have radii about @xmath12 per cent larger and effective temperatures about @xmath2 per cent cooler than theoretical models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , the discrepancies are in the right proportions to produce roughly the same luminosity .",
    "to explain these results , @xcite proposed that close ebs may not be representative of the whole low - mass stars population because of the high rotation regimes produced by spin ",
    "orbit synchronization via tidal interaction .",
    "this explanation is corroborated by the significant correlation found by @xcite between the difference in the radii and the level of magnetic activity .",
    "indeed , both rotation and magnetic fields can reduce the efficiency of convection , which is measured by the parameter @xmath0 in the standard mlt framework ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a faster rotation , moreover , can enhance the magnetic activity through the dynamo effect , leading to a substantial increase in the star - spots coverage of the surface .",
    "both effects were phenomenologically taken into account by @xcite , using a lower @xmath0 with respect to the solar - calibrated value and reducing the radiative flux at the surface proportionally to the star - spots filling factor @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "their results show that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath13 have a degenerate effect on the stellar radius .",
    "they also claim that fc stars are almost insensitive to a variation of @xmath0 and very low values ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) are required to reconcile the models with the observations . finally , according to @xcite",
    ", the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by a systematic error in the light curve - derived radii , which would occur if a value of @xmath13 of about @xmath15 per cent and a concentration of the spots near the stellar poles are postulated .",
    "as @xcite have pointed out , however , theoretical models calculated with a quite restricted set of parameters ( e.g. , solar metallicity ) , have been compared with observations of stars of poorly determined or even unknown metallicity , assuming a general validity that is not rigorously justified .",
    "even a moderate increase in metallicity can result in theoretical radii increases which are significant in comparison with the discrepancies discussed so far .",
    "a combination of all these effects is thus the most likely solution to the low - mass stellar radii problem .    in this paper , we attempt to model the components of the two ebs known to date to host fc stars .",
    "our main focus is to determine the sensitivity of the best - fitting models to various possible choices of the parameters , with as much generality as possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : obs ] we discuss the available data and compare the physical properties of the two systems ; in section  [ sec : models ] we present the code and input physics used in our calculations and in section  [ sec : ttau ] we show the impact of the atmospheric boundary conditions on our models . in sections  [ sec :",
    "k126 ] and [ sec : cmdra ] we discuss our best - fitting solutions for the systems koi-126 and cm draconis ( hereafter cm dra ) , respectively .",
    "we compare our results for koi-126 with those obtained by @xcite in section  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : disc ] , we review results and conclusions of this work .",
    "the systems koi-126 ( kic number : @xmath16 ) and cm dra host the only ebs known to date in the fc mass range .",
    "the former was recently discovered by the kepler mission @xcite ; it is a hierarchical triple system , with a low - mass binary subsystem ( orbital period : @xmath17 d ) orbiting the primary star with a period of @xmath18 d. the second system ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) is composed of two fc stars ( orbital period : @xmath19 d ) which have common proper motion with a white dwarf .    for the stars in these systems , masses and",
    "radii are determined with very high precision from the modelling of the light curve eclipses .",
    "other parameters however , such as metallicity and effective temperatures , are much less well known .",
    "table [ tab : parms ] summarises the known physical parameters of the two systems .",
    "spectroscopic observations of koi-126 only show features associated with the primary star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the online supporting material ) .",
    "however , the light curve analysis provides a determination of the fluxes of the two low - mass stars relative to the primary , which can be used to derive a rough estimate of their effective temperatures .",
    "we proceeded as follows : using synthetic spectra from the nextgen ( ng ) grid ( constructed with the phoenix 1d code , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with solar metallicity and appropriate @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we calculated the theoretical integrated flux for each star of the system , taking into account the response function of kepler @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the effective temperatures fall in the range @xmath22@xmath23 k ; since the radii are known , the luminosities can be derived as well ( see table [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "although considerable effort has been devoted to the study of cm dra , both spectroscopically and photometrically ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the direct determination of its metallicity is still controversial @xcite ; the system is considered a population ii member based on its measured proper motion .",
    "[ tab : parms ]    the masses of the fc components of both systems fall in the range @xmath24 and have remarkably similar ratios .",
    "interestingly , koi-126 c and cm dra 2 have the same mass within the error , but the radius of the latter is significantly larger ( of about @xmath1 per cent ) .",
    "similarly , koi-126 b is about @xmath25 per cent more massive than cm dra 1 , but their measured radii are the same within the error .",
    "the mass  radius relationship followed by cm dra 1 and 2 is indeed very different from that of the fc components of koi 126 , as fig .",
    "[ fig : mrrel ] shows",
    ". correspondingly , the effective temperatures of cm dra are significantly lower than the range estimated for koi-126 b and c. from the raw observational data , taken at face value , we can expect the best - fitting models for the fc stars in the two systems to have quite different properties .    in modelling the two systems",
    ", we used different strategies to cope with their different characteristics and available observational constraints ( e.g. , spectroscopy of koi-126 a , @xmath3 of cm dra 1 and 2 , etc . ) .",
    "for koi-126 , we looked for a self - consistent solution ( in age and composition ) for all the three components , without making any _ a priori _ assumption on the age , as is explained in detail in section  [ sec : k126 ] .",
    "for cm dra , on the other hand , we adopted the age estimate from the literature , since the age sensitivity of fc models is too weak to provide a meaningful self - consistency check ( e.g. , the radius variation is of the order of @xmath26@xmath1 per cent over the whole main sequence lifetime , @xmath27@xmath12 gyr , and about @xmath27 per cent between @xmath27 and @xmath2 gyr ) .",

    "all the models were calculated using the yale rotating stellar evolution code ( yrec , see @xcite ) in its non - rotating configuration .",
    "we used the @xcite opacities at low temperatures , the opal rosseland opacities at high temperatures @xcite , and the opal 2005 equation of state @xcite .",
    "the energy generation rates are calculated according to the prescription of @xcite and the diffusion coefficients for helium and heavy elements are those given by @xcite .",
    "convection is described using the mlt @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xcite value of the solar metallicity , @xmath29 .",
    "the integration of atmospheric layers in yrec requires that the temperature  optical depth ( @xmath30@xmath31 hereafter ) relation is specified .",
    "while the @xcite ( ks in the following ) or eddington grey approximations give reasonably accurate results for the sun or more massive stars , respectively , this is not true for the fc models ( see section  2.5 of @xcite , and also section  [ sec : ttau ] below ) .",
    "for this reason , in all the modelling discussed here , we used the @xmath30-@xmath31 relations taken from the ng model atmospheres of appropriate @xmath32 .",
    "as a reference , with the input physics described so far , a standard solar model calculated with yrec has an initial helium content of @xmath33 and a value of the mlt parameter of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) when using the eddington ( ks ) @xmath30@xmath31 relation .",

    "a @xmath30@xmath31 relation based on a grey atmosphere and/or radiative equilibrium is incorrect for @xmath41 k , because the recombination of molecular hydrogen in the envelope reduces the entropy and the adiabatic gradient , thus favouring the penetration of convection in optically thin layers .",
    "moreover , a grey treatment produces cooler atmospheric profiles below the photosphere , thus leading to overestimated @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we investigated the impact of these effects on our calculations by comparing models of fc stars constructed using the eddington , ks and ng @xmath30@xmath31 relations .",

    "5a - b of @xcite ) .",
    "the models calculated with the grey @xmath30@xmath31 relations have a discontinuity in the temperature gradient near the photosphere ( i.e. around @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is due to the abrupt truncation of convection at the transition from the envelope to the atmosphere , where radiative equilibrium is artificially enforced throughout .",
    "the models using the ng temperature profile , on the other hand , have a much shallower temperature gradient and a smooth envelope - atmosphere transition .",
    "the net effect is that , using eddington ( ks ) grey atmosphere models , we obtain effective temperatures which are overestimated of about @xmath43 k ( @xmath44 k ) with respect to the ng models .",
    "convection is treated according to the standard mlt in the phoenix 1d code .",
    "since the models in the ng grid were all constructed with @xmath45 , we were unable to estimate directly the impact of the value of @xmath0 in the atmosphere on the global stellar quantities .",
    "moreover , a value of @xmath45 in the atmosphere is larger than the one needed to achieve a satisfactory fit of spectral line profiles ( @xcite , see also section  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , inconsistent values of @xmath0 between the atmosphere and the interior of the same stellar model are often required to match satisfactorily all the available observational constraints .",
    "numerical simulations of convection also show that assuming the same value of the mixing length throughout all the outer stellar layers might be an oversimplification ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in our modelling ,",
    "however , this inconsistency does not seem to affect significantly the temperature profile , as is apparent from fig .",

    "for the system koi-126 , we tried to achieve a self - consistency in the best - fitting models of the three components , as follows . given its mass and the preliminary estimate of the age of the system reported by @xcite of @xmath46 gyr , koi-126 a is probably in the early post - main sequence phase , on the way to the red giant branch .",
    "helium and heavy element diffusion and core overshooting were taken into account when modelling this star . with fixed values of the core overshooting parameter @xmath47 and metal content @xmath38 $ ] , we adjusted the helium content and the mlt parameter in order to produce the model of koi-126 a with the closest agreement with the observed @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( we choose to use the @xmath3-@xmath39 plane to take advantage of the high precision in the radius determination ) .",
    "the resulting best - fitting model of the primary star gives the most stringent constraint on the age of the system , since the low - mass components undergo very small changes once they are on the main sequence .",
    "we then tried to fit the radii of koi-126 b , c for each composition , determining an age range that can be used to check for compatibility with the model of the primary .    in modelling koi-126 a , which is massive enough to have a convective core , we tried different values of the core overshooting parameter , within the range @xmath50@xmath51 .",
    "this range is typically adopted for early post - main sequence subgiant stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "such a high metallicity is unlikely for a system of population ii , but it should be emphasized that this membership attribution is based only on the circumstantial evidence provided by the proper motion and that the direct estimate of the metallicity is very controversial ( see the discussion in section  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility of non - standard effects in the structure of cm dra components has been invoked in the past to explain the radius anomaly .",
    "both stars are usually assumed to have synchronised their spin with the orbital period , which makes of them quite fast rotators .",
    "they are also known to have spotted surfaces ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is an indicator of the presence of subsurface magnetic fields .",
    "a fast rotation and/or highly magnetised regime can reduce the efficiency of the convective transport @xcite .",
    "this effect was taken into account by @xcite , as well as a simplified parametrization of the star - spots .",
    "they found that both effects can be phenomenologically represented by a reduction of the mlt parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we thus tried to construct models of cm dra with reduced @xmath0 , which suffices to the purpose of investigating such activity - induced effects within the standard theoretical framework , keeping the number of free parameters to a minimum .",

    "[ fig : cmdra ] shows , with @xmath37 and solar metallicity , the disagreement can be brought within about @xmath69 if a value of @xmath0 as low as @xmath51 is used . however , even reducing @xmath0 down to @xmath70 , we were unable to construct models with stellar radii compatible with the observations within the @xmath71 uncertainty . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the mlt treatment implemented in yrec gives rise to numerical instabilities . in this sense , tuning @xmath0 as a free parameter is insufficient , by itself , to reconcile the models of cm dra 1 and 2 with the observations .",
    "as the moderate sensitivity of fc stars to @xmath0 requires such a drastic , possibly unphysical reduction , we also tried to model cm dra using a combination of the composition ( @xmath54 and @xmath73 ) variation and @xmath0 reduction effects .",
    "with @xmath38=+0.3 $ ] ( i.e. @xmath74 ) and @xmath37@xmath75 , for example , we find that the discrepancy is lower than @xmath6 for @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , a better determination of the composition of the system , based on more robust evidences than kinematic arguments , is required to conclusively settle this issue . since this information is currently missing , we refrain from attempting a precise modelling of cm dra , as was done in section  [ sec : k126 ] for koi-126 .",
    "we believe , nonetheless , that our results suggest a revision of the metallicity of this system towards at least solar - like ( if not higher ) values .",

    "they were able to match very well the observational constraints and to reproduce satisfactorily the mass  radius relationship for the fc components , using a metallicity in the quoted range and a solar - calibrated value of the mlt parameter .",
    "their estimate for the age of the system is @xmath76 gyr .",
    "the codes dsep and yrec have a distant common origin ; they differ mainly in the treatment of some pieces of input physics , namely , the equation of state , the atmospheric boundary conditions , and the presence of turbulent diffusion . as was shown in the previous section ,",
