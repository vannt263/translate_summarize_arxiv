    "merging ( or inspiralling ) dns systems are one of the prime targets for ground - based gravitational - wave ( gw ) interferometers such as geo600 , tama , virgo , and ligo ( the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ) @xcite .",
    "event rates of the dns inspiral searches by these detectors can be inferred using the rate estimates with an extrapolation out to the maximum detection distances for any detector under consideration . before 2003 , the galactic dns merger rate had been estimated between @xmath4 yr@xmath2 ( see kalogera et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) . at that time",
    ", there were only two systems available for empirical studies , psrs  b1913 + 16 @xcite and b1534 + 12 @xcite .",
    "we calculated the pdf of galactic dns merger rates , @xmath5 , based on these two systems ( see kim et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter kkl , for further discussions ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of the highly relativistic system psr  j0737@xmath33039 , we were able to revise @xmath5 including psr  j0737@xmath33039 in collaboration with the observation team@xcite .",
    "the discovery of j0737@xmath33039 , resulted in a significant increase in the estimated galactic dns by a factor of @xmath06 .",
    "this implies a boost in event rates for dns searches for gw interferometers . in this paper",
    ", we present our recent results on : ( i ) the pdf of galactic dns merger rate estimates with updated observations ; ( ii ) the _ global _ pdf of rate estimates considering the systematic uncertainties ; ( iii ) constraints on upper limits for rate estimates based on the observed supernova rate incorporated with our theoretical understanding of the sn - dns relation ; ( iv ) the approximate contribution of j1756@xmath32251 to the galactic dns merger rates and uncertainties in our assumptions on the efficiency of the acceleration searches for parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmps ) .",
    "finally , we discuss implications of the most recently discovered pulsar binary j1906 + 0746 @xcite .",
    "here , we describe the main components of the calculation of the combined @xmath6 considering the three observed dns systems in the galactic disk . the merger rate of a given population _",
    "i _ can be defined by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 represents the number of pulsars in our galaxy with pulse and orbital characteristics _",
    "similar _ to an observed sample _",
    "( e.g. psr j0739@xmath33039 ) and @xmath9 is a correction factor to take into account pulsar beaming ( typically @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the lifetime of system _ i _ based on its observed properties . in order to calculate @xmath8 , we distribute a large population of pulsars _ all _  similar to the system _ i _ , in a model galaxy assuming spatial and luminosity distributions .",
    "since pulsar luminosities are drawn from a distribution , the observed flux and estimated distance for the dns system are not relevant in our calculation .",
    "moreover , the selection effects for faint pulsars are implicitly taken into account .",
    "once we generate a pulsar population with a size @xmath12 , we can then calculate the number of pulsars detected ( @xmath13 ) by large - scale pulsar surveys .",
    "we repeat the survey simulations with a detailed modeling of selection effects for observed dns systems . for a fixed @xmath12",
    ", we find that @xmath13 follows a poisson distribution , p(@xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 is a mean value of @xmath13 for a given population size ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we require @xmath16 , i.e. , we consider only one observed system , and calculate the best - fit value of @xmath15 . with a wide range of @xmath12 , we find @xmath17 as expected where c is a constant . applying bayes theorem to these results ,",
    "we calculate a p(@xmath12 ) , a pdf for the population size of a given system _",
    "i _ knowing that there is one observation .",
    "the calculation @xmath5 from @xmath18 is straightforwad , and the full derivation and formula can be found in appendix  a of kim et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the lifetime of a dns system is defined by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spin - down age of a recycled pulsar @xcite and @xmath21 is the remaining lifetime until the two neutron stars merge @xcite .",
    "based on the most recent observations , we estimate the lifetime of j0737@xmath33039 to be @xmath0230myr @xcite .",
    "this is the shortest among the three observed systems .",
    "the beaming correction factor @xmath22 is defined as the inverse of the fractional solid angle subtended by the pulsar beam .",
    "its calculation requires detailed geometrical information on the beam .",
    "following kalogera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and updating the values with recent observations , we calcualte @xmath22@xmath05.7 for psr b1913 + 16 @xcite and @xmath06.0 for psr b1534 + 12 @xcite without good knowledge of the geometry of j0737@xmath33039 , we assume @xmath23 to be the average value of the other two systems ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "is shown on a log scale .",
    "the thick solid line is the galactic rate estimate overlapped with results for individual observed systems ( dashed lines ) .",
    "dotted lines indicate confidence intervals for the rate estimates .",
    "the same results are shown on a linear scale in the small inset .",
    "all results are from our reference model.,width=275 ]    in fig .  1 , we show @xmath6 for a reference model ( model  6 in kkl ) .",
    "we obtain the most likely value of @xmath25 , larger by a factor of @xmath26 than the rate estimated before the discovery of j0737@xmath33039 .",
    "the increase factor is found similar for all pulsar population models we examined .",
    "the increased merger rates imply a boost in the inferred detection rate of gws from dns inspirals for ground - based gw interferometers such as ligo . in order to calculate the detection rate ( @xmath27 ) , we assume a homogeneous distribution of galaxies in nearby universe and a spherical symmetry in detector sensitivity .",
    "then , we can write @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the number of galaxies in the detection volumne ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we calculate the number density of galaxies derived by the observed blue luminosity density , ( @xmath31myr@xmath32 ( see phinney ( 1991 ) and kalogera et al .  (",
    "2001 ) for more details ) .",
    "the detection volume of ligo can then be defined as a sphere for a given detection distance ( 20 mpc and 350 mpc for the inital and advanced ligo , respectively ) , and the number of galaxies within @xmath30 is simply @xmath33 . for our reference model",
    ", we find that the most probable event rates are about 1 per 30yrs and 1 per 2 days , for initial and advanced ligo , respectively . at the 95% confidence interval ,",
    "the most optimistic predictions for the reference model are 1 event per 9yrs and 1.6 events per day for initial and advanced ligo , respectively .",
    "more details can be found in kalogera et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    as shown in the fig .  1 ,",
    "the galactic dns merger rate is dominated by psr  j0737@xmath33039 .",
    "recently , lorimer et al .  ( 2005a ) suggested that the current age of j0737@xmath33039 is @xmath34 myr .",
    "this implies a even shorter lifetime ( @xmath35 myr ) knowing that the estimated merger timescale of this system is @xmath085 myr .",
    "based on their results , we find the most likely value of @xmath36 for the reference model is @xmath37myr@xmath2 .",
    "the beaming correction for j0737@xmath33039 is not yet constrained and we assume msps discovered in dns systems are not very different . as a conservative lower limit , without any beaming corrections for all observed systems for a reference model , we obtain @xmath38 myr@xmath2 with a 95% confidence interval .",
    "the corresponding detection rates for initial and advanced ligo are @xmath39 yr@xmath2 and @xmath40 yr@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "only when the axis geometry of j0737 - 3039 becomes available , we will be able to constrain the uncertainties of the beaming fraction , and in turn , the rate estimates .",
    "in kkl , we showed that empirical dns merger rates are strongly dependent on the assumed luminosity distribution function for pulsars , but not on the pulsar spatial distribution .",
    "therefore , we can consider only the rate dependence on the pulsar luminosity function for simplicity . here , we describe how we can incorporate the systematic uncertainties from these models and calculate , @xmath41 , a _ global _ pdf of rate estimates .",
    "note that the results available on prior functions for pulsar luminosity distribution are currently out of date .",
    "specific quantitative results could change when constraints on the luminosity function are derived from the current pulsar sample .",
    "we assume a power - law luminosity distribution for a radio pulsar luminosity function @xmath42 .",
    "this function is defined by two parameters : the cut - off luminosity @xmath43 and power - index @xmath44 .",
    "we assume prior distributions for these two parameters and calculate @xmath45 .",
    "we fit the marginalised likelihood of @xmath43 and @xmath44 presented by @xcite and obtain the following analytic formulae for prior functions , i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are coefficients we obtain from the least - square fits and the functions are defined over the intervals @xmath52 $ ] mjy kpc@xmath53 and @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "we note that , although cordes and chernoff ( 1997 ) obtained @xmath46 over @xmath55 $ ] mjy kpc@xmath53 centered at 1.1 mjy kpc@xmath53 , we consider @xmath46 with a peak at @xmath56mjy kpc@xmath53 considering the discoveries of faint pulsars with l@xmath57 below 1 mjy kpc@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "next we calculate @xmath45 as follows : @xmath45 + @xmath58 .     on a linear scale ( lower panel ) and the assumed intrinsic distributions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( upper panels ) .",
    "dotted lines represent the lower ( @xmath59 ) and upper ( @xmath60 ) bounds on the observed sn ib / c rate scaled by 5% of the observed sn ib / c rates , @xmath61 myr@xmath2 ( see text).,width=275 ]    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the distributions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 adopted ( top panels ) and the resulting global distribution of galactic dns merger rate estimates ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we find the peak value of @xmath45 at _ only _ around 13myr@xmath2 .",
    "we note that this is a factor @xmath62 smaller than the result from the reference model ( @xmath6371myr@xmath2 ) . at the 95% confidence interval , we find that the _ global _ galactic dns merger rates lie in the range @xmath0 1145myr@xmath2 .",
    "these imply ligo event rates in the range @xmath64yr@xmath2 ( initial ) and @xmath65yr@xmath2 ( advanced ) .",
    "since 1997 , the number of known millisecond pulsars has more than doubled , and therefore , constraints on @xmath43 and @xmath44 and their pdfs based on the most up - to - date pulsar sample are urgently needed .",
    "according to the standard binary evolution scenario , the progenitor of the second neutron star is expected to form during a type ib / c supernova .",
    "therefore , the empirical estimates for the type ib / c sn rate in our galaxy can be used to set upper limits on the dns merger rate estimates . based on cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we adopt @xmath66myr@xmath2 considering sbc  sd galaxies , a hubble constant @xmath67km / s / mpc and the blue luminosity of our galaxy @xmath68 .",
    "we calculate the fraction of sn ib / c actually involved in the formation of dns with a binary evolution code startrack @xcite and estimate the rate ratio : @xmath69/@xmath70 .",
    "motivated by this result , we adopt the empirical @xmath71 assuming @xmath72 and compare the value with the global pdf ( fig .",

    "results depend on the survey modeling ( see text ) .",
    "+ @xmath80 the nature of the companion is not yet clear .",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a death - time of the pulsar .",
    "+    we note that our most optimistic dns merger rate is @xmath83 myr@xmath2 at a 95% confidence interval ( model  15 in kkl ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath84 with respect to the center value of the empirical sn type ib / c rate ( @xmath85 myr@xmath2 ) and the upper limit of @xmath86 at the 95% confidence interval ( @xmath87 myr@xmath2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath88 for a sn type ii rate , which is factor 6.1 larger than that of sn type ib / c . in both cases ,",
    "the most optimistic model is lower than the current empirical supernova rate estimates , but not really consistent with the results of population synthesis calculations .",
    "if we consider a upper limit of @xmath86 at the 95% confidence interval from the global pdf , we obtain @xmath89 13% and 2% for the center value of sn type ib / c ( 1100 myr@xmath2 ) and ii , respectively .",
    "recently , faulkner et al .",
    "( 2005 ) discovered psr j1756@xmath32251 , the 4th merging dns in the galactic disk from the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmps ) .",
    "the standard fourier method failed to find this pulsar and they reanalysed the pmps data with an acceleration search ( or a ` stack search ' as described in their paper ) . in order to calculate the merger rate including psr j1756@xmath32251 ,",
    "a detailed simulation is necessary to calculate the effect of the acceleration search with the pmps .",
    "however , the approximate contribution of psr j1756@xmath32251 to the galactic merger rate can be easily obtained .",
    "we find the total rate increases by only @xmath90 due to the new discovery .",
    "this is expected because psr j1756@xmath32251 can be identified as a member of the b1913 + 16-like population , which has already been taken into account in the calculation .",
    "only future detections of pulsars from a significantly different population ( compared to the known systems ) , or from the most relativistic systems , will result in a non - trivial contribution to the rate estimates .",
    "finally , we note the implications of j1906 + 0746 on the pulsar binary merger rates .",
    "this system has drawn attention due to the extremely young age of the pulsar ( characteristic age of @xmath0 112 kyr ; lorimer et al .",
    "if the companion is another neutron star , j1906 + 0746 would be the first discovery of a non - recycled component in a dns system .",
    "currently , the nature of the companion is totally unknown , and it can be either a light neutron star , or heavy ( o - mg - ne ) white dwarf . assuming j1906 + 0746 is a dns system , we calculate its contribution to the galactic merger rate .",
    "because of its short lifetime ( @xmath082myr ) , j1906 + 0746 can increase the galactic dns merger rate by about a factor 2 .",
    "this implies that the current estimated dns merger rate including j0737@xmath33039 can still be doubled !",
    "if j1906 + 0746 is an eccentric ns  wd system , such as j1141 - 6545 @xcite or b2303 + 46 @xcite , it will be as important as j1141 - 6545 , which is currently dominate the birthrate of eccentric ns - wd binaries . in table 1",
    ", we summarize some important properties of observed merging dns systems , which used in the calculation of @xmath91 in this paper .",
    "we summarize our results on the galactic merger rate of double neutron stars ( dns ) in view of the recent discovery of psr j0737 - 3039 .",
    "we update the results based on the most recent observations .",
    "global _ pdf of rate estimates incorporates the already known systematics due to the radio pulsar luminosity function .",
    "the most likely value obtained from the global distribution is at only @xmath0 13 myr@xmath2 , and a reanalysis of the _ current _ pulsar sample and radio luminosities is needed for a reliable assessment of the best fitting distribution .",
    "the dns merger rate can be constrained by empirical type ib / c supernova rates , and we compare the supernova rate with the global pdf .",
    "recent discoveries of relativistic systems , such as j1756@xmath32251 and j1906 + 0746 are important for the reduction of the uncertainties associated with the empirical rate estimates . as for j1756@xmath32251",
    ", we expect their contribution to the galactic dns merger rate is negligible , and this pulsar can be seen another sample of b1913 + 16-like population .",
