    "understanding the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking and its possible relation to dm constitute two of the most profound theoretical challenges at present .",
    "new strong dynamics at the electroweak scale @xcite may very well provide a solution to the problem of the origin of the bright and dark @xcite mass .",
    "a large class of models has recently been proposed @xcite which makes use of higher dimensional representations of the underlying technicolor gauge group .",
    "this has triggered much work related to both the lhc phenomenology , lattice studies and dm @xcite . for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "here we provide an explicit example of ( near ) conformal ( nc ) technicolor @xcite with two types of technifermions , i.e. transforming according to two different representations of the underlying technicolor gauge group @xcite .",
    "the model possesses a number of interesting properties to recommend it over the earlier models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking :    * features the lowest possible value of the naive @xmath0 parameter while possessing a dynamics which is nc .",
    "* contains , overall , the lowest possible number of fermions . * yields natural dm candidates .    due to the above properties we term this model _ ultra minimal near conformal technicolor _ ( umt ) .",
    "it is constituted by an @xmath1 technicolor gauge group with two dirac flavors in the fundamental representation also carrying electroweak charges , as well as , two additional weyl fermions in the adjoint representation but singlets under the sm gauge groups .    in the next section",
    "we arrive at this specific umt model using the conjectured all - orders beta function for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories @xcite . in section [ model ]",
    "we write the underlying lagrangian and identify the global symmetries of the theory before and after dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "we then construct both the linearly and non - linearly realized low - energy effective lagrangians .",
    "we naturally embed the standard model ( sm ) interactions within the global symmetries of the underlying gauge theory . several low - energy composite particles are sm singlets .",
    "in particular there is a di - techniquark state which is a possible cold dm candidate .",
    "this technicolor interacting massive particle ( timp ) is a natural cold dm candidate as shown in section [ timp ] .",
    "we also estimate the fraction of the mass in the universe constituted by our dm candidate over the baryon one as function of the lepton number and the dm mass .",
    "the new timp , differently from earlier models @xcite , can be sufficiently light to be directly produced and studied at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the expected rate of events detectable in experiments such as cdms @xcite , as function of the dm mass , is computed showing that it is not constrained by current data .",
    "we draw our conclusions in the final section .",
    "to construct a realistic model of electroweak symmetry breaking one is faced with the constraints coming from the electroweak precision tests .",
    "specifically the new physics beyond the sm must not give a too large contribution to the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "consider an @xmath2 technicolor theory with @xmath3 dirac fermions in the representation @xmath4 .",
    "the naive estimate of @xmath0 computed in the approximation of a techniquark loop with momentum - independent constituent masses much heavier than the @xmath5 mass parameter when allowing for a dynamical techniquark mass .",
    "this computation suggests , in agreement with the results in @xcite , that the @xmath0 parameter is further reduced with respect to the value from the naive analysis . ]",
    "is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dimension of the representation @xmath4 . from the estimate above it",
    "is clear that an @xmath1 technicolor theory with two dirac fermions in the fundamental representation yields the smallest possible contribution .",
    "however for this low number of flavors the theory is far from possessing nc dynamics and the naive @xmath0 value underestimates the physical value @xcite .",
    "the situation changes for nc theories @xcite .    insisting on a nc model with this minimal @xmath0 parameter an obvious way to obtain conformality is to add the remaining fundamental flavors , neutral under the electroweak symmetries , needed to be just outside the conformal window .",
    "the near conformal technicolor theories constructed in this way have been termed partially gauged technicolor @xcite . however , as we shall show below , by arranging the additional fermions in higher dimensional representations , it is possible to construct models which have a particle content smaller than the one of partially gauged technicolor theories .",
    "in fact instead of considering additional fundamental flavors we shall consider adjoint flavors . note that for two colors there exists only one distinct two - indexed representation .",
    "how many adjoint fermions are needed to build the above nc model ?",
    "information on the conformal window for gauge theories containing fermions transforming according to distinct representations is vital .",
    "first principle lattice simulations are exploring the conformal window for higher dimensional representations @xcite .",
    "however the models we are constructing have not yet been explored on the lattice .    to elucidate the various possibilities we make use of our recently conjectured all - order beta function for a generic @xmath2 gauge theory with fermionic matter transforming according to arbitrary representations @xcite .",
    "considering @xmath8 dirac flavors belonging to the representation @xmath9 of the gauge group it reads @xmath10 with @xmath11    one should note that the beta function is given in terms of the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the renormalized mass , similar to the supersymmetric case @xcite .",
    "indeed the construction of the above beta function is inspired by the one of their supersymmetric cousin theories . at small coupling",
    "it coincides with the two - loop beta function and in the non - perturbative regime reproduces earlier known exact results .",
    "similar to the supersymmetric case it allows for a bound of the conformal window @xcite . in the supersymmetric case",
    "where additional checks can be made the bound is actually believed to give the true conformal window .",
    "we stress that the predictions of the conformal window coming from the above beta function are nontrivially supported by all the recent lattice results @xcite .",
    "first , the loss of asymptotic freedom is determined by the change of sign in the first coefficient @xmath14 of the beta function .",
    "this occurs when    @xmath15    hence for a two color theory with two fundamental flavors the critical number of adjoint weyl fermions above which one looses asymptotic freedom is @xmath16 .",
    "second , we note that at the zero of the beta function we have @xmath17    therefore specifying the value of the anomalous dimensions at the infrared fixed point yields the last constraint needed to construct the conformal window .",
    "having reached the zero of the beta function the theory is conformal in the infrared . for a theory to be conformal",
    "the dimension of the non - trivial spinless operators must be larger than one in order to not contain negative norm states @xcite .",
    "since the dimension of the chiral condensate is @xmath18 we see that @xmath19 , for all representations @xmath20 , yields the maximum possible bound @xmath21    this implies , for example , that for a two technicolor theory with two fundamental dirac flavors the critical number of adjoint weyl fermions needed to reach the bound above on the conformal window is @xmath22 .",
    "the actual size of the conformal window can be smaller than the one determined by the bound above .",
    "it may happen , in fact , that chiral symmetry breaking is triggered for a value of the anomalous dimension less than two . if this occurs the conformal window shrinks .",
    "within the ladder approximation one finds that chiral symmetry breaking occurs when the anomalous dimension is close to one .",
    "picking @xmath23 we find : @xmath24 in this case when considering a two color theory with two fundamental dirac flavors the critical number of adjoint weyl flavors is @xmath25 .",
    "hence , our candidate for a nc theory with a minimal @xmath0 parameter has two colors , two fundamental dirac flavors charged under the electroweak symmetries and two adjoint weyl fermions .",
    "this is the ultra minimal nc technicolor model ( umt ) .    if it turns out that the anomalous dimension above which chiral symmetry breaking occurs is larger than one we can still use the model just introduced .",
    "we will simply break its conformal dynamics by adding masses ( anyway needed for phenomenological reasons ) for the adjoint fermions .",
    "the fermions transforming according to the fundamental representation are arranged into electroweak doublets in the standard way and may be written as :    @xmath26    the additional adjoint weyl fermions needed to render the theory quasi conformal are denoted as @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "they are not charged under the electroweak symmetries .",
    "also we have suppressed technicolor indices .",
    "the theory is anomaly free using the following hypercharge assignment @xmath29 our notation is such that the electric charge is @xmath30 . replacing the higgs sector of the sm with the above technicolor theory",
    "the lagrangian reads : @xmath31 with the technicolor field strength @xmath32 .",
    "the covariant derivatives for the various fermions are @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the technicolor gauge coupling , @xmath35 is the electroweak gauge coupling and @xmath36 is the hypercharge gauge coupling .",
    "also @xmath37 are the electroweak gauge bosons while @xmath38 is the gauge boson associated to the hypercharge .",
    "both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are pauli matrices and they are the generators of the technicolor and weak gauge groups respectively",
    ".    the global symmetries of the theory are most appropriately handled by first arranging the fundamental fermions into a quadruplet of @xmath41    @xmath42    since the fermions belong to pseudo - real and real representations of the gauge group the global symmetry of the theory is enhanced and can be summarized as @xmath43 the abelian symmetry is anomaly free . following ref .",
    "@xcite the characteristic chiral symmetry breaking scale of the adjoint fermions is larger than that of the fundamental ones since the dimension of the adjoint representation is larger than the dimension of the fundamental representation .",
    "we expect , however , the two scales to be very close to each other since the number of fundamental flavors is rather low . in the two - scale technicolor models @xcite the dynamical assumption is instead , that the different scales of the condensates are very much apart from each other .",
    "the global symmetry group @xmath44 breaks to @xmath45 .",
    "the stability group @xmath46 is dictated by the ( pseudo)reality of the fermion representations and the breaking is triggered by the formation of the following two condensates @xmath47 where @xmath48 the flavor indices are denoted with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the spinor indices as @xmath51 and the color indices as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82 states included the matrices are actually form invariant under @xmath83 and @xmath84 with the abelian parts being broken by anomalies .",
    "we construct our lagrangian by considering only the terms preserving the anomaly free u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "as we will see this implies that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not mass eigensates . in the diagonal basis",
    "we will find one massless and one massive state .",
    "the massless state corresponds to the @xmath56 goldstone boson .",
    "the relation between the composite scalars and the underlying degrees of freedom can be found by first noting that @xmath63 and @xmath64 transform as : @xmath87 where both color and spin indices have been contracted .",
