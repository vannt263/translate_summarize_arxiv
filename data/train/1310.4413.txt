    "the optical conductivity of the frhlich polaron model attracted attention for years @xcite . in the regime of weak coupling , the optical absorption of a polaron was calculated using different methods , e. g. , green s function method @xcite , the low - lee - pines formalism @xcite , perturbation expansion of the current - current correlation function @xcite . the strong - coupling polaron optical conductivity",

    "the electron fc wave functions constitute a complete orthogonal set . however , the corresponding phonon wave functions can be non - orthogonal because of a different shift of phonon coordinates for different electron states .",

    "the polaron optical conductivity spectra calculated within the present strong - coupling approach are shifted to lower frequencies with respect to the optical conductivity spectra calculated within the lp approximation of ref .",
    "this shift is due to the use of the numerically accurate strong coupling energy levels and wave functions of the internal polaron states , and of the numerically accurate self - consistent adiabatic polaron potential .    according to the selection rules for the matrix elements of the electron - phonon interaction ,",

    "the contribution of the @xmath113-phonons to the optical conductivity spectra is not small compared to the contribution of the @xmath111-phonons .",

    "this is in accordance with the fact that the present strong - coupling approach for the polaron optical conductivity is asymptotically exact in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the total polaron optical conductivity must satisfy the sum rule @xcite@xmath116 in the weak- and intermediate - coupling regimes at @xmath117 , there are two contributions to the left - hand side of that sum rule : ( 1 ) the contribution from the polaron optical conductivity for @xmath118 and ( 2 ) the contribution from the central peak  at @xmath119 , which is proportional to the inverse polaron mass @xcite . in the asymptotic strong - coupling regime ,",
    "the inverse to the polaron mass is of order @xmath63 , and hence the contribution from the central peak  to the polaron optical conductivity is beyond the accuracy of the present approximation ( where we keep the terms @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) .    as discussed above , in the present work the transitions from the ground state to the states of the continuous part of the polaron energy spectrum",
    "are neglected .",
    "therefore the integral over the frequency [ the left - hand side of ( [ sr1 ] ) ] for the optical conductivity calculated within the present strong - coupling approximation can be ( relatively slightly ) smaller than @xmath122 .",
    "the relative contribution of the transitions to the continuous part of the polaron spectrum , @xmath123 , can be therefore estimated as@xmath124 where the right - hand side is obtained by a numerical integration of @xmath125 calculated within the present strong - coupling approach .",
    "this numeric estimation shows that for @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , with increasing @xmath3 , the relative contribution of the transitions to the continuous part of the polaron spectrum falls down .",
    "this confirms the accuracy of the present strong - coupling approach .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the optical conductivity of a strong - coupling polaron was calculated assuming that in the strong - coupling regime the polaron optical response is provided mainly by the transitions to the continuous part of the spectrum ( these transitions are called there the polaron dissociation ) .",
    "this concept is in contradiction both with the early estimation by pekar @xcite discussed above and with the very small weight of those transitions shown in fig .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite in fact takes into account only a small part of the strong - coupling polaron optical conductivity ",
    "namely , the high - frequency tail  of the optical conductivity spectrum .",
    "when comparing the polaron optical conductivity spectra calculated in the present work with the dqmc data @xcite , we can see that the present approach , with respect to dqmc , underestimates the high - frequency part of the polaron optical conductivity .",
    "this difference , however , gradually diminishes with increasing @xmath3 , in accordance with the fact that the present method is an asymptotic strong - coupling approximation .",
    "because the optical conductivity spectra calculated in the present strong - coupling approximation using the expressions ( [ resig ] ) and ( [ sjt ] ) represent the envelopes of the res peak with the multi - phonon satellites , the separate peeks are not explicitly seen in those spectra .",
    "the fc and res peaks are indicated in the figures by the arrows .",
    "the fc transition frequency @xmath128 in the strong - coupling case is positioned close to the maximum of the polaron optical conductivity band ( both calculated within the present approach and within dqmc ) .",
    "the res transition frequency is positioned one @xmath129 below the onset of the lo - sidebands .",
    "note that the strong - coupling polaron optical conductivity derived in refs .",
    "@xcite contains only the zero - phonon ( res ) line and no phonon satellites at all .",
    "in contrast , in the present calculation , the maximum of the polaron optical conductivity spectrum shifts to higher frequencies with increasing @xmath3 , so that the multiphonon processes invoking large number of phonons become more and more important , in accordance with predictions of refs . @xcite .    it is worth noting the following important point : the maximum of the polaron optical conductivity band can be hardly interpreted as a broadened transition to an fc state on the following reasons .",
    "formula ( [ f - ad3 ] ) describes a set of multi - phonon peaks . in the simplifying approximation which neglects the jahn  teller effect ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , those peaks are positioned at the frequencies @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the number of emitted phonons and is the frequency of the zero - phonon line .",
    "the frequencies @xmath132 do not coincide with the fc transition frequencies but are determined by@xmath133 where the huang - rhys factor @xmath134 describes the energy shift due to lattice relaxation .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameters @xmath134 obviously implies that the peaks at @xmath130 should be attributed to transitions to the res with emission of @xmath131 phonons .",
    "so , the so - called fc transition  is realized as the envelope of a series of phonon sidebands of the polaron res but not as a transition to the fc state .",
    "the account of the jahn - teller effects in general makes the multiphonon peak series non - equidistant , but it changes nothing in the concept of the internal polaron states which is discussed above .",
    "we have derived the polaron optical conductivity which is asymptotically exact in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the strong - coupling polaron optical conductivity band is provided by the multiphonon transitions from the polaron ground state to the polaron res and has the maximum positioned close to the fc transition frequency . with increasing the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 , the polaron optical conductivity band shape gradually tends to that provided by the diagrammatic quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) method .",
    "this agreement demonstrates the importance of the multiphonon processes for the polaron optical conductivity in the strong - coupling regime .    the obtained polaron optical conductivity with a high accuracy satisfies the sum rule @xcite , what gives us an evidence of the fact that in the strong - coupling regime the dominating contribution to the polaron optical conductivity is due to the transitions to the _ internal _ polaron states , while the contribution due to the transitions to the continuum states is negligibly small .",
