    "the extension of the coupled - cluster ( cc ) approach  @xcite , originally devised for ground - states , to the treatment of electronic excitation has afforded the emergence of a variety of highly successful computational methods , excelling at the potential for both numerical efficiency and accuracy .",
    "the excited - state cc methodology comprises three major developments referred to as coupled - cluster linear response ( cclr ) theory  @xcite , the equation - of - motion coupled - cluster ( eom - cc ) approach  @xcite , and the symmetry - adapted cluster configuration interaction ( sac - ci )  @xcite . while these developments vary in the derivation of the cc equations , the resulting computational schemes are largely equivalent . a notable difference , however , is the treatment of transition moments and excited - state properties , where , in contrast to the cc - eom and sac - ci schemes , cclr theory leads to size - consistent expressions .",
    "the basic feature of the cc methods is the use of so - called correlated excited ( ce ) states as basis states in the expansion of the exact excited states .",
    "these ce states are obtained by applying physical excitation operators associated with single ( s ) , double ( d ) , triple ( t ) , @xmath0 electron excitations to the exact ( correlated ) cc ground - state , @xmath1 , rather than to the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state , @xmath2 , establishing in the latter case the familiar configuration interaction ( ci ) basis states or ci configurations .",
    "obviously , the ce states represent intermediates of sorts , positioned in - between the simple ci configurations and the exact final states .",
    "accordingly , methods based on the use of ce states have been referred to as intermediate state representations ( isr )  @xcite , and the excited - state cc approach is closely related to the family of isr methods .",
    "however , the ce states are not orthonormal , and this problem is dealt with by introducing in addition to the ce states the associated set of biorthogonal states . using the biorthogonal states on the left side and the ce states on the right - hand side , one obtains a mixed ( biorthogonal ) representation of the ( shifted ) hamiltonian giving rise to a non - hermitian secular matrix .",
    "the two sets of states differ distinctly in their intrinsic quality .",
    "in fact , the biorthogonal states can be identified essentially as ci configurations .",
    "this means that the bcc ( biorthogonal cc ) representation represents a hybrid approach , combining the ci and isr concepts in equal measure .",
    "what are the merits of an isr approach as compared to the conceptually so much simpler ci treatment ?",
    "the answer is that the isr methods are not ( or much less ) affected by two basic deficiencies of the ci approximation schemes , namely the lack of size - consistency and the need for relatively large explicit configuration spaces .",
    "the size - consistency error inherent to limited ci treatments ( as opposed to full(f ) ci expansions ) stems from the _ non - separable _ structure of the ci secular equations .",
    "more precisely , for a system composed of non - interacting fragments there is no _ a priori _ decoupling of the ci secular matrix into corresponding fragment blocks .",
    "the inevitable and , moreover , uncontrollable size - consistency error associated with truncated ci expansions grows with the system size , rendering the results for extended systems useless .",
    "this is why ci can not rank as a genuine many - body method .",
    "secondly , large ci expansions ( configuration spaces ) are needed to suppress the quite unfavorable truncation error , that is , the error due to discarding higher excitation classes in the ci expansions .",
    "for example , a ci expansion extending through single and double excitations ( cisd ) induces a truncation error of second - order of perturbation theory ( pt ) in the excitation energies of singly excited states . in the cc methods , by contrast , the corresponding ( sd ) truncation error is of third order . yet",
    "more advantagous is the situation in full ( hermitian ) isr methods , where the sd truncation error is already of fourth order .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review the separability properties and truncation error characteristics of the excited - state cc schemes , aiming here at a more systematic and more comprehensive analysis than available so far .",
    "previous studies of this kind have been presented by jrgensen and collaborators within the context of cclr theory , addressing the size - consistency of the cc excitation energies  @xcite and transition moments  @xcite , and analyzing the truncation errors in the cc excitation energies  @xcite .",
    "studies devoted to the size - consistency of the excited state cc equations have also been presented by mukhopadhyay _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and stanton  @xcite . from a different perspective ,",
    "the so - called order relations of the bcc secular matrix and the ensuing truncation errors in the cc excitation energies have been discussed by the present authors  @xcite and by trofimov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . however , the latter studies , devised essentially to enable comparison to the adc ( algebraic - diagrammatic construction ) propagator methods  @xcite , were somewhat limited and suffered , moreover , from certain misconceptions concerning the cc transition moments .",
    "the analysis given in this paper of the excited - states cc approach will be formulated entirely within the framework of the bcc concept , that is , a non - hermitian secular problem associated with a dual representation of the ( shifted ) hamiltonian in terms of two biorthogonal sets of basis states . while in the eom - cc development",
    ", the bcc representation is introduced more or less in an _ ad hoc _ manner , depicting the bcc secular matrix essentially as a ci - type representation of an effective ( similarity transformed ) hamiltonian , the cclr approach is based on response theory for time - dependent cc ground state expectation values .",
    "clearly , the cclr derivation is highly original and instructive , and , in fact , transcends the simple bcc formulation in the case of the transition moments and various reponse properties .",
    "however , the essence of the emerging computational scheme can much easier be presented and understood using the bcc concept .",
    "thus , it should be permissible and even advisable to abandon the original notations associated with linear response theory and rather resort to a stringent wave function formulation adapted to the bcc concept . not only will this make the excited state cc methods more amenable to readers not familiar with the rather demanding time - dependent cc response theory",
    ", it will also allow us to embed the cc approach quite naturally in the broader context of isr methods .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the ci method with regard to the truncation error and separability properties .",
    "iii presents the basics of the cc approach to electronic excitation .",
    "this is followed in sec .",
    "iv by an analysis of the properties of the bcc representation and the resulting excitation energies , transition moments , and excited state properties .",
    "v contrasts the bcc representation with a full ( hermitian ) isr approach .",
    "a summary and some conclusions are given in the final sec .",
    "some important supporting material is presented in a tripartite appendix . in app .  a the proof of the bcc order relations is reviewed . in app .",
    "b we derive the order relations of both ci and bcc eigenvector matrices , which , in turn , allows us to generate general truncation error formulas .",
    "the cclr forms of the right transition moments and excited - state properties are reviewed in app .  c.",
    "the justification of the intrinsically more complicated intermediate state representations derives from basic shortcomings of the standard configuration - interaction ( ci ) approach with regard to the truncation error of the ci expansions and the size - consistency of the results . to provide for a general background we begin with a brief recapitulation of the ci problems .    for the electronically excited states @xmath3 of an atom or molecule the schrdinger equation",
    "may be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the system under consideration , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the ground state energy and excitation energy , respectively . in the ci treatment , being the standard quantum chemical method , the excited states are expanded according to @xmath8 as a linear combination of ci states @xmath9 generated by applying `` physical '' excitation operators @xmath10 to the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state , @xmath11 . using the notation of second quantization , the excitation operator manifold may be expressed as follows : @xmath12 here @xmath13 denote creation ( annihilition ) operators associated with hf orbitals @xmath14 . following a widely adopted convention ,",
    "the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote unoccupied ( virtual ) and occupied orbitals , respectively , while the indices @xmath17 will be used in the general case .",
    "the capital indices @xmath18 are used as an abbreviation for strings of one - particle indices , e.g. , @xmath19 .",
    "the excitation operators in ( [ eq : xops ] ) can be divided into classes of @xmath20-@xmath21 ( single ) , @xmath22-@xmath23 ( double ) , @xmath0 excitations . for brevity",
    ", these classes will be numbered consecutively , that is , the class of @xmath24-@xmath25 excitations is referred to as class @xmath26 .",

    "for example , @xmath28 = 2 $ ] means @xmath27 is a double excitation .",
    "the hf ground state @xmath11 , being part of the ci expansions ( [ eq : ciexp ] ) , constitutes a zeroth class ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the excitation energies and expansion coefficients are obtained as the eigenvalues and eigenvector components , respectively , of the ci eigenvalue problem , reading in a compact matrix notation @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the ( subtracted ) ci secular matrix , @xmath32 @xmath33 denotes the diagonal matrix of excitation energies @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the matrix of ( column ) eigenvectors @xmath36 .",
    "note that the subtraction of the ground - state energy @xmath6 in the diagonal of the ci secular matrix is a mere convention here , introduced for formal analogy to the bcc representation considered in sec .",
    "approximate ci treatments are obtained by limited ci expansions as opposed to full ( fci ) expansions . in the following",
    "we will be concerned with systematic truncations of the ci expansions , that is , expansions being complete through a given excitation class @xmath26 .",
    "these systematic truncation schemes can be examined with respect to the perturbation - theoretical order of the induced error in the ci results . for this purpose",
    "one has to inspect the `` order structure '' of the ci secular matrix ( fig .  1 )",
    ", that is , a perturbation - theoretical classification of the subblocks @xmath37 associated with a partitioning of @xmath31 with respect to the excitation classes . fig .",
    "1 shows the characteristic ci structure , where each excitation class is coupled linearly in the coulomb integrals ( first order ) to the next and next but one excitation class .",
    "owing to the ( zeroth order ) orbital energy contributions of the diagonal matrix elements , the diagonal blocks are indicated by zeros .",
    "the order structure of the ci secular matrix gives rise to characteristic truncation errors in the excitation energies .",
    "as the most important case , let us consider singly excited states , that is , states deriving perturbation - theoretically from @xmath20-@xmath21 configurations ( ci basis states ) .",
    "due to the linear ( first - order ) coupling to triple ( @xmath38-@xmath39 ) excitations ( see fig .  1 ) , there is a second - order energy contribution to the single excitation energies arising from the admixture of triple excitations .",
    "this means that a second - order truncation error arises in the single - excitation energies if the triple excitations are not taken into account .",
    "a stringent derivation of the general ci truncation errors is given in app .",
    "specifically , the truncation error orders ( teo ) for single excitation energies are given by the following formula : @xmath40 here @xmath26 denotes the highest excitation class included in the ci expansion manifold . in table  1 the resulting teos for @xmath41 are listed .    besides the energies , the transition moments @xmath42 are of interest , required to compute spectral intensities . here",
    "@xmath43 denotes a ( one - particle ) transition operator , e.g. , a dipole operator component . to evaluate the truncation error of the transition moments one has to analyze the ci expression @xmath44 with respect to the order relations of the ci eigenvectors @xmath36 and @xmath45 , respectively , and the ci representation of @xmath43 , @xmath46 the order relations of the ci eigenvectors for singly excited states and for the ground state , shown in fig .  1",
    ", are part of the general order structure of the ci eigenvector matrix @xmath35 , derived in app .  b.1 .",
    "together with the trivial order structure of @xmath47 ( zeroth - order diagonal and off - diagonal blocks , other matrix elements vanishing ) one can deduce the following simple teo expression for the transition moments of singly excited states : @xmath48 for odd values of @xmath26 the teos of the transition moments are smaller by 1 as compared to the excitation energies .",
    "the ci truncation errors are relatively large , which , in turn , implies that large ci expansions are required to meet specific accuracy levels .",
    "for example , in order to treat singly excited states consistently through second order of perturbation theory ( pt ) , the ci configuration space must comprise the triple excitations ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the isr methods a much smaller explicit configuration space , consisting of single and double excitations , affords the corresponding level of accuracy .    to analyze the size - consistency properties of a method",
    ", one usually resorts to the separate fragment model , that is , a system @xmath50 consisting of two strictly non - interacting fragments , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "a method for treating electronic excitation is size - consistent ( here , more specifically , size - intensive ) if for local excitations , say on fragment a , the computed excitation energies and transition moments do not depend on whether the method is applied to the fragment or the composite system .",
    "it is well known that truncated ci treatments do not fulfill this property .",
    "there is an uncontrollable size - consistency error in the treatment of the total system , corrupting not only the results for the separate fragment model , but , more generally , any truncated ci treatment of larger molecules .",
    "this can be nicely demonstrated in the exactly solvable model of a chain of non - interacting two - electron two - orbital(@xmath53-@xmath54 ) systems , such @xmath55 he atoms or minimal basis h@xmath56 molecules ( see , for example , meunier and levy  @xcite ) . because of this deficiency the ci method does not qualify for a genuine many - body method .    as a preparation for the analysis of the bcc schemes",
    "let us briefly inspect the case of ci in some more detail .",
    "obviously , the hamiltonian for @xmath50 decomposes into the sum of the fragment hamiltonians , @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the one - particle states ( hf orbitals ) of @xmath50 can be classified as belonging either to fragment @xmath51 or @xmath52 ( local on a or b , respectively ) .",
    "accordingly , the ci states can be partitioned into three different sets , that is , local excitations @xmath58 on fragment @xmath51 , local excitations @xmath59 on fragment @xmath52 , and mixed ( or non - local ) excitations @xmath60 involving both fragment a and b. in the latter class we may disregard any excitations that do not conserve the local electron number , e.g. , @xmath61 charge - transfer excitations . in the non - interacting fragment model , such charge transfer excitations",
    "are strictly decoupled from the fragment - charge conserving excitations , which are of interest here .",
    "the ci configurations @xmath62 can be written as products of fragment states , e.g. , @xmath63 it should be noted that the neglect of full antisymmetrization of these product states is irrelevant because in the non - interacting fragment model matrix elements are not affected by inter - fragment antisymmetrization .",
    "2 shows the partitioning of the ci secular matrix with respect to the three different types of configurations , that is , local excitations on fragment @xmath51 , local excitations on fragment @xmath52 , and non - local excitations , respectively . while the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states are strictly decoupled , @xmath64 , there is a coupling between the local and mixed excitations , e.g. , @xmath65 as can easily be derived using the ci state factorization according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cibf ] ) .",

    "given the structure as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "the ci secular matrix is said to be _ non - separable _ because there is no _ a priori _ decoupling of local excitations ( say on fragment @xmath51 ) from non - local ( or mixed ) excitations .",
    "the ci treatment of the composite system @xmath50 aims in an inextricable way at an optimal description of both fragments , that is , the excited state of fragment @xmath51 and the ground state of fragment @xmath52 . in the exact ( full ) ci result ,",

    "the bcc order structure gives rise to specific truncation errors of the excitation energies , which can be analyzed by inspecting formal perturbation - theoretical ( pt ) interaction paths on the subblocks of the bcc secular matrix .",
    "as an example , let us consider the following path : @xmath189 this path allows one to specify formally a pt contribution in the excitation energy of a single excitation ( class 1 ) arising from the admixture of triple excitations ( class 3 ) .",
    "the pt order of this path is 3 , and there is no lower - order path involving class 3 .",

    "a more general and stringent derivation of the bcc truncation errors is to be based on the order relations of the bcc eigenvector matrices , as is discussed in app .",
    "b. in short , the order relations in the bcc secular matrix induce corresponding order relations for the left and right eigenvector matrices @xmath190 and @xmath35 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "10 , the bcc eigenvector matrices combine canonical and ci - type behaviour : the ll part of @xmath35 and the ur part of @xmath190 exhibit canonical order relations , whereas ci - type order relations ( fig .",

    "notwithstanding the apparently non - separable block structure of @xmath216 , the bcc excitation energies are obtained in a separable way  @xcite .",

    "4 . for a local excitation @xmath144 , say on fragment @xmath51 , the only non - vanishing components are fragment-@xmath51 components @xmath218 , and since @xmath219 it is readily established that the fragment-@xmath51 part of @xmath220 is equal to the corresponding fragment-@xmath51 eigenvector , @xmath221 .",

    "together with the separable eigenvectors this ensures size - consistent results for the adc - isr transition moments .",
    "the case of the excited state properties and transition moments has been discussed in ref .",
    "the basic concept underlying the cclr and eom - cc methods for electronic excitation in atoms and molecules consists in a specific biorthogonal representation of the ( shifted ) hamiltonian in terms of two distinct sets of states : on the one hand , the set of excited cc states based the cc ground state , and , on the other hand , the set of their biorthogonal counterparts .",
    "this results in a non - hermitian ( bcc ) secular matrix .",
    "the excitation energies are obtained as the eigenvalues of the bcc secular matrix , while both the left and right eigenvectors enter the calculation of the spectral intensities .",
    "the two sets of states are of quite different quality .",
    "while the latter ( biorthogonal ) basis states are essentially of ci - type , that is , excited hartree - fock ( hf ) configurations , the excited cc states , by contrast , are formed by applying physical excitation operators to the exact @xmath120-electron ground state .",
    "the resulting correlated excited ( ce ) states are expected to be superior to the simple ci states as they already account for a major part of electron correlation .",
    "the intuitive idea here is that electron correlation in excited states should not be completely different from that in the ground state .",
    "in fact , the use of ce intermediate states warrants distinctive advantages over the simple ci treatment .",
    "foremost , this concerns the truncation error associated with limited expansion manifolds . to attain comparable accuracy",
    ", the manifold of ce states can be truncated at distinctly smaller excitation levels than the ci expansions . moreover , the excited cc states are intrinsically separable with regard to ( hypothetical ) non - interacting fragments , which , in contrast to ci , allows to devise size - consistent approximation schemes based on truncated expansion manifolds .",
    "however , due to the equitable use of the biorthogonal set of states being essentially of ci - type , the bcc representation must be viewed as a ci - isr hybrid rather than a full isr approach .",
    "this becomes strikingly manifest in the split order structure of the bcc secular matrix , being canonical and of ci - type in the ll and ur parts , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the truncation error and separability properties are clearly superior to those of ci , but also weaker than those of a full isr method such as the adc - isr presented in sec .",
    "v. this is reflected in the general truncation error order ( teo ) formulas derived here for excitation energies , transition moments , and property matrix elements . in the case of single excitations at truncation level 2 ( that is , neglecting triply and higher excited configurations ) ,",
    "the teos in the excitation energies and transition moments are 2 , 3 , and 4 for ci , bcc , and adc , respectively . at higher truncation levels the gap between ci and bcc , as well as that between bcc and adc widens . at the (",
    "already somewhat academic ) truncation level 6 the respective teos are 6 , 9 , and 12 .",
    "of course , a given approximation may not exhaust the margin afforded by the respective teo .",
    "for example , the error in the transition moments of the cc2 scheme is of pt order 2 ( due to the first - order approximation used for the @xmath404 amplitudes ) , while the truncation error is of pt order 3 .",
    "the adc(2 ) approximation allows for a consistent treatment of ( single excitation ) energies and transition moments through 2nd order , the teo being 4 .",
    "let us note that the pt order of the overall error is only an indicator for the quality of an approximation scheme . a large error order does not by itself guarantee accurate results , but rather must be seen as a necessary condition for accuracy : a certain accuracy level can only be attained in compliance with a corresponding pt order of the characteristic error .",
    "the hybrid character of the bcc representation is also reflected in the separability properties .",
    "the excitation energies , given as the roots of the characteristic polynomial , are separable , which , in principle , ensures size - consistent results at approximative levels beneath the full bcc treatment .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the separability of the eigenvalues applies strictly speaking only to the ( fictitious ) separated fragment model . allowing for a small interaction between the fragments @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 , which is a more realistic simulation of an extended system , the separability becomes blurred because the coupling block @xmath201 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) no longer vanishes , and local and non - local excitations may mix .",
    "what is problematic here is that the small matrix elements of @xmath201 , associated with the weak physical coupling of the fragments , form products , e.g. in the characteristical polynomial , with the large ( non - local coupling ) matrix elements of @xmath303 .",
    "the mixing can become substantial when local and non - local excitations are nearly degenerate .",
    "this problem has been addressed by helgaker _",
    "( see p. 684 ) , but a thorough dedicated study seems to be still outstanding .",
    "the bcc eigenvectors do not perform uniformly , as the left and right eigenvectors are non - seperable and seperable , respectively . in",
    "the associated left and ( ordinary ) right transition moments , both of which are needed for the computation of spectral intensities , the separability properties are reversed : separable left tms , as opposed to non - separable right tms . this reversal is due to the use of the dual ground - state and the cc ground - state in the right and left tms , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the spectral intensities based on the ordinary bcc tms are not size - consistent .",
    "this problem does not arise within the cclr framework , as here a separable , though more involved expression for the right tm is used . in the full bcc limit the cclr expression and the ordinary one , used in the eom - cc methods , are equivalent . at approximate levels , however , the consistency of the left ( ordinary ) and right ( cclr ) tms may become an issue . at the simple ccs ( singles ) level , for example , both the left and ordinary right tms",
    "are consistent through zeroth order ( due to the use of the hf ground state ) .",
    "the right tm in the cclr formulation , however , is consistent through first order .",
    "this means that the cclr spectral intensity expression combines a zeroth - order left tm and a first - order right tm .",
    "one might be inclined to see this as an improvement , but it should be noted that a result comprising incomplete first - order terms may be inferior to that of a consistent zeroth - order approximation . the consistency problem emerges also in the finding that for transitions with low spectral strengths the signs of the left and right cclr transition moments may differ , leading to unphysical ( i.e. negative ) intensities .",
    "this is to say that the cclr results are not necessarily more accurate than those of eom - cc as long as size - consistency does not play a role",
    ". a conclusive comparative test of eom - cc and cclr intensity results for smaller and medium - sized molecules would be highly desirable .",
    "such a study should also comprise excited state properties for which both ordinary non - separable bcc or separable cclr expressions are available .    of course , the most obvious drawback of the bcc methods is the non - hermiticity of the respective secular matrices @xmath216 .",
    "as already discussed , both the right and left eigenvectors are needed when spectral intensities and property matrix elements are to be determined , which requires an additional effort compared to the hermitian eigenvalue problem of a full isr method . in the case of degenerate eigenvalues ,",
    "care has to be taken to ensure the proper biorthogonalization of the associated sets of left and right eigenvectors .",
    "more disturbing is the possibility of complex eigenvalues . even though the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian , so that the excitation energies obtained as eigenvalues of @xmath216 must ultimately ( in the full bcc limit ) be real quantities , one may encounter problems in actual computations .",
    "as first noticed and analyzed by httig  @xcite , complex eigenvalues can occur in the vicinity of conical intersections of two excited state energy surfaces ( or hyper - surfaces ) .",
    "khn and tajti@xcite have developed some ideas of how to deal with that situation , but so far there remain open questions .",
    "the present analysis of the bcc methods for ( neutral ) electron excitations in an @xmath120-electron system can readily be extended to the case of generalized excitations , such as ( @xmath120-@xmath405)- or ( @xmath120+@xmath405)-electron excitations used in the treatment of ionization or electron attachment processes , respectively .",

    "the analysis given here of the eom - cc and cclr methods from the perspective of the bcc representation has shown decisive advantages over the conventional ci treatment , but also distinctly weaker teo and separability properties than those of a full isr approach such as the adc - isr . it should be noted , however , that the latter approach is manifestly based on perturbation theory for the secular matrix elements and effective transition coefficients , behaving essentially like the rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) pt expansions of the ground state energies and ci expansion coefficients .",
    "this means that both the adc methods and ground - state pt have the same condition of applicability , namely a sufficiently large energy gap between the occupied and virtual hf orbital energies .",
    "when the energy gap becomes too small , for example at bond breaking nuclear conformations , pt based methods are bound to fail .",
