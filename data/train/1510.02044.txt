    "the warped product submanifolds of a pseudo - reimannian manifold served as a fruitful platform in exploring , identifying and to solve problems in mathematical physics , especially in different models of spacetime , black holes , ricci flow and hamiltonian spaces ( c.f.,@xcite ) . in @xcite , bishop and",
    "oneill initiated the theory of warped product submanifold as a generalization of pseudo - reimannian product manifolds .",
    "the study has attained momentum when chen @xcite introduced the geometric depiction of warped product cr - submanifolds in kahlerian manifold @xmath3 through differential point of view and proved the non - existence of proper warped product cr - submanifolds in the form @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is a holomorphic submanifold and @xmath6 is a totally real submanifold of @xmath3 .    apart from warped product submanifolds , there is a major generalized class of both holomorphic and totally real submanifolds , called slant submanifolds .",

    "later on , slant and semi - slant submanifolds in contact riemannian geometry are studied by lotta and cabrerizo , respectively @xcite .",
    "this geometric setting may not found suitable in mathematical physics particularly , in the theory of space time and black hole , where the metric is not necessarily positive definite .",
    "thus , the geometry of slant submanifolds with indefinite metric became a topic of investigation , and sahin gave the notion of slant lightlike submanifolds of indefinite hermitian manifolds @xcite .",
    "since then several geometers have contributed many important characterization to the warped product slant submanifolds in almost contact , complex and lorentzian manifolds ( c.f.,@xcite ) .",

    "further , we give some examples of a @xmath0-anti - slant warped product submanifold @xmath2 , where @xmath8 is anti - invariant and @xmath9 is proper slant submanifold of a nearly paracosymplectic manifold @xmath1 . finally , we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for a submanifold of @xmath1 to be a @xmath0-anti - slant warped product of the form @xmath2 .",
