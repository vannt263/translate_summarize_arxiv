    "<S> the crystal growth velocity is maximized when the efficiency of converting interfacial water molecules to ice , collectively known as the attachment kinetics , is greatest . </S>",
    "<S> we find water molecules that contact the intermediate ice layer in concave regions along the atomistically roughened surface are more likely to freeze directly . </S>",
    "<S> an increased roughening of the solid surface at large undercoolings consequently plays an important limiting role on the rate of ice growth , as water molecules are unable to integrate into increasingly deeper surface pockets . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms for self - assembly of solid phases that are important in many biological and atmospheric processes . </S>"
