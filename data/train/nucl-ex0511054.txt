    "the structure of the vanadium isotopes is based on simple shell - model configurations at low excitation energies . the valence protons and neutrons are occupying the single - particle @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals , respectively .",

    "n _ , _ z _ = 20 and 28 shell gaps , making the vanadium isotopes interesting objects for studying various nuclear shell effects . in particular , it is well known that the number of available singe - particle levels is significantly reduced for nuclei at closed shells .",
    "the density of states or , equivalently , the entropy in these systems depends on the number of broken cooper pairs and single - particle orbitals made available by crossing the shell gaps .",
    "the @xmath0v nuclei are of special interest because the neutrons are strongly blocked in the process of creating entropy ; @xmath8v and @xmath9v have seven and eight neutrons in the @xmath7 orbital , respectively .",
    "thus , the configuration space of the three protons in the @xmath6 shell is of great importance .",
    "these particular shell - model configurations are also expected to govern the @xmath4-decay routes .",
    "specifically , as within every major shell , the presence of only one parity for single - particle orbitals in the low - spin domain means that transitions of @xmath10 type will be suppressed .",
    "the low mass of the investigated nuclei causes that the centroid of the giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) is relatively high while the integrated strength according to the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule is low , both observations working together to produce a relatively weak low - energy tail when compared to heavier nuclei .",
    "hence , possible non - statistical effects in the radiative strength function ( rsf ) might stand out more in the present investigation .",
    "the oslo cyclotron group has developed a method to extract first - generation ( primary ) @xmath4-ray spectra at various initial excitation energies .",
    "from such a set of primary spectra , the nuclear level density and the rsf can be extracted simultaneously @xcite .",
    "these two quantities reveal essential information on nuclear structure such as pair correlations and thermal and electromagnetic properties . in the last five years",
    ", the oslo group has demonstrated several fruitful applications of the method @xcite .    in sect .",
    "ii an outline of the experimental procedure is given .",

    "the experiment was carried out at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) using a beam of 30-mev @xmath1he ions .",
    "the self - supporting natural v target had a purity of @xmath11% and a thickness of 2.3 mg/@xmath12 .",
    "particle-@xmath4 coincidences for @xmath0v were measured with the cactus multi - detector array @xcite .",
    "the charged ejectiles were detected using eight si particle telescopes placed at an angle of 45@xmath13 relative to the beam direction .",
    "each telescope consists of a front @xmath14 detector and a back @xmath15 detector with thicknesses of 140 and 1500 @xmath16 m , respectively .",
    "an array of 28 collimated nai @xmath4-ray detectors with a total efficiency of @xmath1715% surrounded the target and the particle detectors .",
    "the reactions of interest were the pick - up reaction @xmath9v(@xmath1he,@xmath2)@xmath8v , and the inelastic scattering @xmath9v(@xmath1he,@xmath1he@xmath18)@xmath9v .",
    "the typical spin range is expected to be @xmath19 .",
    "the experiment ran for about one week , with beam currents of @xmath20 na .    the experimental extraction procedure and",
    "the assumptions made are described in refs .",
    "the data analysis is based on three main steps :    * preparing the particle-@xmath4 coincidence matrix * unfolding the @xmath4-ray spectra * constructing the first - generation matrix    in the first step , for each particle - energy bin , total spectra of the @xmath4-ray cascades are obtained from the coincidence measurement . the particle energy measured in the telescopes",
    "is transformed to excitation energy of the residual nucleus , using the reaction kinematics .",
    "then each row of the coincidence matrix corresponds to a certain excitation energy @xmath15 , while each column corresponds to a certain @xmath4 energy @xmath21 .    in the next step ,",
    "the @xmath4-ray spectra are unfolded using the known response functions of the cactus array  @xcite .",
    "the compton - subtraction method described in ref .",
    "@xcite preserves the fluctuations in the original spectra without introducing further , spurious fluctuations .",
    "a typical raw @xmath4 spectrum is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : unfolding ] , taken from the @xmath8v coincidence matrix gating on the excitation energies between @xmath22 mev .",
    "the middle panel shows the unfolded spectrum , and in the bottom panel this spectrum has been folded with the response functions .",
    "the top and bottom panels are in excellent agreement , indicating that the unfolding method works very well .",
    "the third step is to extract the @xmath4-ray spectra containing only the first @xmath4 rays in a cascade .",
    "these spectra are obtained for each excitation - energy bin through a subtraction procedure as described in ref .",
    "the main assumption of this method is that the @xmath4-decay spectrum from any excitation - energy bin is independent of the method of formation , either directly by the nuclear reaction or populated by @xmath4 decay from higher - lying states following the initial reaction .",
    "this assumption is automatically fulfilled when the same states are equally populated by the two processes , since @xmath4 branching ratios are properties of the levels themselves . even if different states are populated",
    ", the assumption is still valid for statistical @xmath4 decay , which only depends on the @xmath4-ray energy and the number of accessible final states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , the total , unfolded @xmath4 spectrum , the second and higher generations @xmath4 spectrum and the first - generation spectrum of @xmath8v with excitation - energy gates @xmath22 mev are shown .",
    "the first - generation spectrum is obtained by subtracting the higher - generation @xmath4 rays from the total @xmath4 spectrum .    when the first - generation matrix is properly normalized  @xcite , the entries of it are the probabilities @xmath23 that a @xmath4-ray of energy @xmath24 is emitted from an excitation energy @xmath15 .",
    "the probability of @xmath4 decay is proportional to the product of the level density @xmath25 at the final energy @xmath26 and the @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient @xmath27 :    @xmath28    this factorization is the generalized form of the brink - axel hypothesis@xcite , which states that any excitation modes built on excited states have the same properties as those built on the ground state .",
    "this means that the @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient is independent of excitation energy and thus of the nuclear temperature of the excited states .",
    "there is evidence that the width of the giant dipole resonance varies with the nuclear temperature of the state on which it is built  @xcite .",
    "however , the temperature corresponding to the excitation - energy range covered in this work is rather low and changes slowly with excitation energy ( @xmath29 ) ; thus we assume a constant temperature and that the @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient does not depend on the excitation energy in the energy interval under consideration .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 functions can be determined by an iterative procedure @xcite , where each data point of these two functions is simultaneously adjusted until a global @xmath32 minimum with the experimental @xmath33 matrix is reached .",
    "no @xmath34 @xmath35 assumptions about the functional form of either the level density or the @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient are used .",
    "an example to illustrate the quality of the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhosig ] , where we compare for the @xmath9v(@xmath1he,@xmath2)@xmath8v reaction the experimental first - generation spectra to the least-@xmath32 solution for six different initial excitation energies .",
    "the globalized fitting to the data points determines the functional form of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; however , it has been shown @xcite that if one solution for the multiplicative functions @xmath30 and @xmath36 is known , one may construct an infinite number of other functions , which give identical fits to the @xmath37 matrix by @xmath38\\,\\rho(e - e_\\gamma ) , \\label{eq : array1}\\\\ \\tilde{{\\mathcal{t}}}(e_\\gamma)&=&b\\exp(\\alpha e_\\gamma){\\mathcal{t } } ( e_\\gamma ) .",
    "\\label{eq : array2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the transformation parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which correspond to the physical solution , remain to be determined .",
    "the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 can be obtained by normalizing the level density to the number of known discrete levels at low excitation energy  @xcite and to the level density estimated from neutron - resonance spacing data at the neutron binding energy @xmath42",
    "the procedure for extracting the total level density @xmath30 from the resonance energy spacing @xmath43 is described in ref .",
    "since our experimental level - density data points only reach up to an excitation energy of @xmath44 mev , we extrapolate with the back - shifted fermi - gas model with a global parametrization  @xcite @xmath45 where a constant attenuation coefficient @xmath46 is introduced to adjust @xmath47 to the experimental level density at @xmath48 .",
    "the intrinsic excitation energy is estimated by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 mev is the back - shift parameter and @xmath40 is the mass number .",
    "the pairing energy @xmath51 is based on pairing gap parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 evaluated from even - odd mass differences @xcite according to  @xcite .",
    "the level - density parameter @xmath34 and the spin - cutoff parameter @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",

    "the parameters used for @xmath0v in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath59v is unstable and no information exists on the level density at @xmath42 for @xmath8v .",
    "therefore , we estimate the value from the systematics of other nuclei in the same mass region . in order to bring these data on the same footing",
    ", we plot the level densities as a function of intrinsic energy @xmath60 . due to the strongly scattered data of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhosyst ] , the estimate is rather uncertain .",
    "we choose a rough estimate of @xmath61 mev@xmath62for @xmath8v .",
    "this value gives an attenuation @xmath63 0.46 , which is in good agreement with the obtained value of @xmath46 = 0.51 for the @xmath9v nucleus .",
    "figure [ fig : counting50v ] demonstrates the level density normalization procedure for the @xmath8v case , i.e. , how the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : array2 ] ) are determined to obtain a level - density function consistent with known experimental data .",
    "the experimentally extracted and normalized level densities of @xmath8v and @xmath9v are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rholev ] for excitation energies up to @xmath17 8 and 9 mev , respectively .",
    "the level density of @xmath8v is relatively high and has a rather smooth behaviour due to the effect of the unpaired proton and neutron , while the level density of @xmath9v displays distinct structures for excitation energies up to @xmath17 4.5 mev .",
    "this effect is probably caused by the closed @xmath64 neutron shell in this nucleus .",
    "the level densities of @xmath0v obtained with the oslo method are compared to the number of levels from spectroscopic experiments  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9v nucleus has relatively few levels per energy bin because of its closed neutron shell , so using spectroscopic methods to count the levels seems to be reliable up to @xmath17 4 mev excitation energy in this case . for higher excitations",
    "the spectroscopic data are significantly lower compared to the level density obtained with the oslo method .",
    "this means that many levels are not accounted for in this excitation region by using standard methods .",
    "the same can be concluded for @xmath8v , and in this case the spectroscopic level density drops off already at an excitation energy of about 2.5 mev .",
    "the level densities of @xmath0v are also compared to the constant - temperature formula @xmath65 which is drawn as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : rholev ] . here",
    "the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath57 are the level density at about zero excitation energy and the average temperature , respectively ; both are estimated from the fit of the exponential to the region of the experimental level density indicated by arrows . from this model a constant temperature of about 1.3 mev is found for both nuclei",
    ".    the level density of a system can give detailed insight into its thermal properties .",
    "the multiplicity of states @xmath67 , which is the number of physically obtainable realizations available at a given energy , is directly proportional to the level density and a spin - dependent factor @xmath68 , thus @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the average spin at excitation energy @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , the experimentally measured level density in this work does not correspond to the true multiplicity of states , since the @xmath71 degeneracy of magnetic substates is not included .",
    "if the average spin of levels @xmath72 at any excitation energy were known , this problem could be solved by multiplying an energy - dependent factor @xmath73 to the experimental level density . however , little experimental data exist on the spin distribution .",
    "therefore , we choose in this work to use a multiplicity @xmath74 based on the experimental level density alone : @xmath75    the entropy @xmath76 is a measure of the degree of disorder of a system at a specific energy .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble , where the system is completely isolated from any exchange with its surroundings , is often considered as the appropriate one for the atomic nucleus since the strong force has such a short range , and the nucleus normally does not share its excitation energy with the external environment .    according to our definition of the multiplicity of levels",
    "@xmath74 obtained from the experimental level density , we define a `` pseudo '' entropy @xmath77 which is utilized in the following discussion . for convenience boltzmann s",
    "constant @xmath78 can be set to unity .    in order to normalize the entropy the multiplicity is written as @xmath79 .",
    "the normalization denominator @xmath80 is to be adjusted such that the entropy approaches a constant value when the temperature approaches zero in order to fullfill the third law of thermodynamics : @xmath81 . in the case of even - even nuclei",
    "the ground state represents a completely ordered system with only one possible configuration .",
    "this means that the entropy in the ground state is @xmath82 , and the normalization factor @xmath83 is chosen such that this is the case . since the vanadium nuclei have an odd number of protons , a @xmath80 which is typical for even - even nuclei in this mass region is used for both the @xmath8v and the @xmath9v nucleus .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath80 used is 0.7 mev@xmath62 , found from averaging data on @xmath8ti and @xmath84cr .",
    "the entropies of @xmath0v extracted from the experimental level density are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vds ] .",
    "naturally , they show the same features as the level density plot , with the odd - odd @xmath8v displaying higher entropy than the odd - even @xmath9v .",
    "since the neutrons are almost ( @xmath8v ) or totally ( @xmath9v ) blocked at low excitation energy , the multiplicity and thus the entropy is made primarily by the protons in this region .    at 4 mev of excitation energy",
    "a relatively large increase of the entropy is found in the case of @xmath9v .",
    "this is probably because the excitation energy is large enough to excite a nucleon across the @xmath85 shell gap to other orbitals .    in the excitation region above @xmath17 4.5 mev",
    "the entropies show similar behaviour , which is also expressed by the entropy difference @xmath86 displayed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vds ] .",
    "we assume here that the two systems have an approximately statistical behaviour , and that the neutron hole in @xmath8v acts as a spectator to the @xmath9v core .",
    "the entropy of the hole can be estimated from the entropy difference @xmath87(@xmath8v)@xmath88(@xmath9v ) . from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vds ] we find @xmath89 for @xmath90 mev .",
    "this is slightly less than the quasi - particle entropy found in rare - earth nuclei , which is estimated to be @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "this is not unexpected since the single - particle levels are more closely spaced for these nuclei ; they have therefore more entropy .",
    "the naive configurations of @xmath0v at low excitations are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "thus , by counting the possible configurations within the framework of the bcs model  @xcite in the nearly degenerate @xmath64 shell , one can estimate the multiplicity of levels and thus the entropy when no cooper pairs are broken in the nucleus , one pair is broken and so on .",
    "we assume a small deformation that gives four energy levels with nilsson quantum number @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the proton - neutron coupling and hence assume that the protons and the neutrons can be considered as two separate systems ; the total entropy based on the number of energy levels can then be written as @xmath95 .",
    "this gives @xmath96 for the nucleus @xmath8v , and @xmath97 for @xmath9v when two protons are coupled in a cooper pair .",
    "these values are in fair agreement with the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : vds ] at an excitation energy below @xmath98 mev .",
    "it is gratifying that these crude estimates give an entropy of the neutron hole in @xmath8v of @xmath99 , in good agreement with the experimental value for the entropy difference of @xmath100 found from fig .",
    "[ fig : vds ] .    with the three @xmath64 protons unpaired we obtain a total entropy of @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath0v , respectively .",
    "this means that the process of just breaking a proton pair within the same shell does not contribute much to the total entropy , but when a nucleon has enough energy to cross the shell gap a significant increase of the entropy is expected .",
    "as already mentioned , at excitation energies above @xmath17 4 mev , it is very likely that configurations from other shells will participate in building the total entropy .",
    "the @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : axel ] ) is expressed as a sum of all the rsfs @xmath103 of electromagnetic character @xmath104 and multipolarity @xmath105 : @xmath106 the slope of the experimental @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient @xmath31 has been determined through the normalization of the level densities , as described in sect .",
    "the remaining constant @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : array2 ] ) is determined using information from neutron resonance decay , which gives the absolute normalization of @xmath31 . for this purpose",
    "we utilize experimental data  @xcite on the average total radiative width @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "we assume here that the @xmath4-decay taking place in the quasi - continuum is dominated by @xmath10 and @xmath109 transitions and that the number of positive and negative parity states is equal . for initial spin @xmath110 and parity @xmath111 at @xmath42 ,",
    "the expression of the width  @xcite reduces to @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the average spacing of @xmath114-wave neutron resonances .",
    "the summation and integration run over all final levels with spin @xmath115 , which are accessible by dipole ( @xmath116 ) @xmath4 radiation with energy @xmath24 . from this expression",
    "the normalization constant @xmath41 can be determined as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , some considerations have to be made before normalizing according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) .",
    "methodical difficulties in the primary @xmath4-ray extraction prevent determination of the function @xmath117 in the interval @xmath118  mev .",
    "in addition , the data at the highest @xmath4-energies , above @xmath119  mev , suffer from poor statistics .",
    "we therefore extrapolate @xmath31 with an exponential form , as demonstrated for @xmath9v in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigext ] . the contribution of the extrapolation to the total radiative width given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) does not exceed @xmath120% , thus the errors due to a possibly poor extrapolation are expected to be of minor importance  @xcite .",
    "again , difficulties occur when normalizing the @xmath4-ray transmission coefficient in the case of @xmath8v due to the lack of neutron resonance data . since the average total radiative width @xmath107 at @xmath108 does not seem to show any clear systematics for nuclei in this mass region , we choose the same absolute value of the gedr tail for @xmath8v as the one found for @xmath9v from photoabsorption experiments .",
    "the argument for this choice is that the gedr should be similar for equal number of protons provided that the two nuclei have the same shapes .",
    "since it is assumed that the radiative strength is dominated by dipole transitions , the rsf can be calculated from the normalized transmission coefficient by @xmath121 we would now like to decompose the rsf into its components from different multipolarities to investigate how the @xmath10 and @xmath109 radiation contribute to the total strength .",
    "the kadmenski , markushev and furman ( kmf ) model  @xcite is employed for the @xmath10 strength . in this model ,",
    "the lorentzian gedr is modified in order to reproduce the nonzero limit of the gedr for @xmath122 by means of a temperature - dependent width of the gedr .",
    "the @xmath10 strength in the kmf model is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the cross section , @xmath125 is the width , and @xmath126 is the centroid of the gedr determined from photoabsorbtion experiments .",
    "we adopt the kmf model with the temperature @xmath57 taken as a constant to be consistent with our assumption that the rsf is independent of excitation energy . the possible systematic uncertainty caused by this assumption",
    "is estimated to have a maximum effect of 20% on the rsf  @xcite .",
    "the values used for @xmath57 are the ones extracted from the constant - temperature model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ct ] ) .",
    "the gedr is split into two parts for deformed nuclei .",
    "data of @xmath9v from photoabsorption experiments show that the gedr is best fitted with two lorentzians , indicating a splitting of the resonance and a non - zero ground - state deformation of this nucleus .",
    "indeed , @xmath41(@xmath127 ) values  @xcite suggest a deformation of @xmath128 0.1 for @xmath0v .",
    "therefore , a sum of two modified lorentzians each described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) is used ( see table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) .    for @xmath129 , which is supposed to be governed by the spin - flip @xmath109 resonance @xcite , the lorentzian giant magnetic dipole resonance ( gmdr ) @xmath130 is adopted .",
    "the gedr and gmdr parameters are taken from the systematics of ref .",
    "@xcite and are listed in table  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "thus , we fit the total rsf given by @xmath131 to the experimental data using the normalization constant @xmath132 as a free parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath132 generally deviates from unity due to theoretical uncertainties in the kmf model and the evaluation of the absolute normalization in eq .",
