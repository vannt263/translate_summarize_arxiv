    "<S> we use qcd sum rules to study the recently observed resonance - like structures in the @xmath0 mass distribution , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , considered as @xmath3 and @xmath4 molecules with the quantum number @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight and work at leading order in @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath8 , around 100 mev above the @xmath9 threshold , and @xmath10 , around 100 mev below the @xmath11 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the @xmath3 state is probably a virtual state that is not related with the @xmath1 resonance - like structure . in the case of the @xmath11 molecular state , </S>",
    "<S> considering the errors , its mass is consistent with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonance - like structures . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that no definite conclusion can be drawn for this state from the present analysis .    the recent discovery of several missing states and a number of unexpected charmonium like resonances in b - factories has revitalized the interest in the espectroscopy of the charmonium states . </S>",
    "<S> there is growing evidence that at least some of these new states are non conventional @xmath12 states , such as mesonic molecules , tetraquarks , and/or hybrid mesons . among these new mesons , </S>",
    "<S> some have their masses very close to the meson - meson threshold like the @xmath13 @xcite and the @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of special importance is the appearance of the @xmath14 , observed in the @xmath15 mass spectrum produced in the @xmath16 decays . </S>",
    "<S> being a charged state it can not be described as ordinary @xmath12 meson . </S>",
    "<S> its nature is completely open , but an intriguing possibility is the interpretation as tetraquark state or molecular state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 observation motivated studies of other @xmath17 decays . in particular , the belle collaboration has recently reported the observation of two resonance - like structures in the @xmath18 mass distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of each of the @xmath0 structures exceeds 5@xmath19 and , if they are interpreted as meson states , their minimal quark content must be @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> they were called @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and their masses and widths are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are already theoretical interpretations for these structures as tetraquark states with @xmath6 @xcite and as molecular @xmath25 state with @xmath5 @xcite . in this work , due to the closeness of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 thresholds respectively , we use the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite , to study the two - point functions of the @xmath9 molecule with @xmath5 , and the @xmath11 molecule with @xmath6 , to see if they can be interpreted as the new observed resonances structures @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since they were observed in the @xmath0 channel , the only quantum numbers that are known about them are @xmath28 .    in previous calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the qcdsr approach was used to study the @xmath13 considered as a diquark - antidiquark state @xcite and as a @xmath29 molecular state @xcite , the @xmath14 meson , considered as a @xmath30 molecular state @xcite and as tetraquark states @xcite , and the @xmath31 mesons considered as molecular and tetraquark states @xcite . in some cases a very good agreement with the experimental mass was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the qcdsr approach was also used to study the existence of a @xmath32 molecule with @xmath33 , that would decay into @xmath34 and , therefore , could be easily reconstructed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the @xmath1 resonance structure as a @xmath3 molecule with @xmath35 , a possible current describing such state is given by : j=(|d_a_c_a)(|c_b^u_b ) , [ field ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are color indices .    </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule is constructed from the two - point correlation function : ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0 |t[j(x)j^(0)]|0 . on the ope side </S>",
    "<S> , we work at leading order in @xmath7 in the operators and consider the contributions from condensates up to dimension eight . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function in the ope side can be written as a dispersion relation : ^ope(q^2)=_4m_c^2^ds </S>",
    "<S> ^ope(s)s - q^2 , where @xmath38 is given by the imaginary part of the correlation function : @xmath39 $ ] .    in the phenomenological side </S>",
    "<S> , we write a dispersion relation to the correlation function in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) : ^phen(q^2)=ds ^phen(s)s - q^2 + , [ phen ] where @xmath40 is the spectral density and the dots represent subtraction terms . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density is described , as usual , as a single sharp pole representing the lowest resonance plus a smooth continuum representing higher mass states : ^phen(s)&=&^2(s-^2 ) + ^cont(s ) , [ den ] where @xmath41 gives the coupling of the current to the scalar meson @xmath42 : [ eq : decay ] 0 | j|d^*d^*=. [ lam ]    for simplicity , it is assumed that the continuum contribution to the spectral density , @xmath43 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ den ] ) , vanishes bellow a certain continuum threshold @xmath44 . above this threshold , it is assumed to be given by the result obtained with the ope . therefore , one uses the ansatz @xcite ^cont(s)=^ope(s)(s - s_0 ) ,    after making a borel transform to both sides of the sum rule , and transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side , the sum rules for the scalar meson @xmath45 , considered as a scalar @xmath9 molecule , up to dimension - eight condensates , using factorization hypothesis , can be written as : ^2e^-^2/m^2=_4m_c^2^s_0ds   e^-s / m^2  ^ope(s ) + ^mix(m^2 ) , [ sr1 ] where ^ope(s)=^pert(s)+^(s ) + ^g^2(s)+^mix(s)+^^2(s ) , with [ eq : pert ] & & ^pert(s)=32 ^ 9 ^6_^ d^3 _ ^1-d^3(1 - - ) ^4 , + & & ^(s)=-3m_c2 ^ 5 ^ 4_^ d^2 _ ^1-d^2 , + & & ^g^2(s)=m_c^22 ^ 8 ^ 6_^ d^3_^1-d(1 - - ) , + & & ^mix(s)=-3m_cm_0 ^ 22 ^ 6 ^ 4 _ ^d [ m_c^2-(1-)s ] , + & & ^^2(s)=m_c^2 ^ 24 ^ 2 , [ dim6 ] where the integration limits are given by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and we have used @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we have neglected the contribution of the dimension - six condensate @xmath50 , since it is assumed to be suppressed by the loop factor @xmath51 . for completeness </S>",

    "<S> [ dim8 ] one should note that a complete evaluation of the dimension-8 condensate contributions require more involved analysis including a nontrivial choice of the factorization assumption basis @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this calculation .    for a consistent comparison with the results obtained for the other molecular states using the qcdsr approach , we have considered here the same values used for the quark masses and condensates as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . to determine the borel window , we analyse the ope convergence and the pole contribution : the minimum value of the borel mass is fixed by considering the convergence of the ope , and the maximum value of the borel mass </S>",
    "<S> is determined by imposing that the pole contribution must be bigger than the continuum contribution . to fix the continuum threshold range we extract the mass from the sum rule , for a given @xmath44 , and accept such value of @xmath44 if the obtained mass is in the range 0.4 gev to 0.6 gev smaller than @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> using these criteria , we evaluate the sum rules in the borel range @xmath58 , and in the @xmath44 range @xmath59 gev .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconv ] we see that for @xmath60 gev@xmath61 the contribution of the dimension-8 condensate is less than 20% of the sum of the other contributions . </S>",
    "<S> using this fact as a criterion to establish a reasonable ope convergence , we fix the lower value of @xmath62 in the sum rule window as @xmath63 gev@xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between pole and continuum contributions for @xmath64 gev is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpvc ] . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum for @xmath65 . the maximum value of @xmath62 for which this constraint is satisfied depends on the value of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis for the other values of the continuum threshold gives @xmath66 gev@xmath61 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 gev@xmath61 for @xmath69 . in our numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we shall then consider the range of @xmath62 values from 2.5 @xmath70 until the one allowed by the pole dominance criterion given above .    to extract the mass @xmath71 we take the derivative of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) with respect to @xmath72 , and divide the result by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmz1 ] , we show the @xmath9 meson mass , for different values of @xmath57 , in the relevant sum rule window , with the upper and lower validity limits indicated . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the results are very stable as a function of @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> using the borel window , for each value of @xmath44 , to evaluate the mass of the @xmath9 meson and then varying the value of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath59 gev , we get @xmath73 .    because of the complex spectrum of the exotic states , some times lower continuum threshold values are favorable in order to completely eliminete the continuum above the resonance state . therefore , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmz1 ] we also include the result for the @xmath9 meson mass for @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that we get a very narrow borel window , and for values of the continuum threshold smaller than 4.4 gev there is no allowed borel window . </S>",
    "<S> considering then the continuum threshold in the range @xmath75 gev , we get @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> to check the dependence of our results with the value of the charm quark mass , we fix @xmath77 and vary the charm quark mass in the range @xmath78 . using @xmath79 we get @xmath80 .    up to now </S>",
    "<S> we have taken the values of the quark - gluon mixed condensate and the gluon condensate without allowing any uncertainties . while from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconv ] we can see that a change in the gluon condensate value has little effect in our results , this is not the case for the quark - gluon mixed condensate . allowing @xmath81 to vary in the range @xmath82 and fixing @xmath77 we get @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> . finally , assuming a possible violation of the factorization hypothesis , one should multiply @xmath84 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dim6 ] ) and ( [ dim8 ] ) by a factor @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath86 , which means a violation of the factorization hypothesis by a factor 2 , and @xmath77 we get @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , taking into account the uncertainties in the qcd parameters as discussed above we arrive at = ( 4.130.07^+0.09  + 0.08  + 0.01_-0.05  -0.04  -0.03 )  , where the first , second , third and forth errors come from the uncertainties in @xmath88 and the factorization hypothesis respectively . adding the errors in quadrature we finally arrive at = ( 4.150.12 )  , [ z1mass ] where the central value is around 130 mev above the @xmath89 threshold , indicating the existence of repulsive interactions between the two @xmath90 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> strong interactions effects might lead to repulsive interactions that could result in a virtual state above the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this structure may or may not indicate a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering the errors , it is compatible with the observed @xmath1 resonance mass .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also deduce , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr1 ] ) the parameter @xmath41 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lam ] ) . we get : = ( 4.20^+0.68  + 0.46  + 0.45  + 0.19_-0.88  -0.30  -0.19  + 0.03 ) 10 ^ -2  ^5 , [ la1 ] where the first , second , third and forth errors come from the uncertainties in @xmath88 and the factorization hypothesis respectively . adding the errors in quadrature we finally arrive at @xmath91 .    since to obtain the mass we have taken the derivative of the sum rule in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr1 ] ) , it is important also to check if the convergence of the ope and the pole contribution dominance are also satisfied for the derivative sum rule .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconvderi ] we see that the ope convergence is even better as from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconv ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is correct to fix the lower value of @xmath62 from the convergence of the original sum rule in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the pole contribution , we show in table i the values of @xmath62 for which the pole contribution is 50% of the total contribution , for each value of @xmath57 .     +    [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     again we see that the upper limits in the borel window imposed by the derivative sum rule are smaller than the ones obtined with the original sum rule , and this would restrict the range of values allowed for the continuum threshold . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will allow a small violation in the 50% pole contribution criterion in the derivative sum rule , and we will work in the borel window allowed by the original sum rule .    in the case of the @xmath11 molecule </S>",
    "<S> we get a worse borel stability than for the @xmath9 , in the allowed sum rule window , as a function of @xmath62 , as can be seen by fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmz2 ] .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmz2 ] , we show the @xmath11 meson mass , for different values of @xmath57 , in the relevant sum rule window , with the upper validity limits indicated . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the results are not very stable as a function of @xmath62 .    using the value of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath92 gev , and varying @xmath93 and @xmath85 as discussed above , we get = ( 4.10^+0.12  + 0.05  + 0.01  + 0.28_-0.08  -0.05  -0.09  -0.02 )  , where the first , second </S>",
    "<S> , third and forth errors come from the uncertainties in @xmath88 and the factorization hypothesis respectively . adding the errors in quadrature we finally arrive at = ( 4.190.22 )  , [ z2mass ] where the central value is around 100 mev below the @xmath94 threshold , and around 60 mev smaller than the mass of the @xmath2 resonance structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this case , there is an atractive interaction between the mesons @xmath95 and @xmath96 which can lead to the molecular state discussed above . considering the uncertainties in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z2mass ] ) , and the width of the @xmath2 resonance structure : @xmath24 , it seems to us that it is possible to describe this structure as a @xmath11 molecular state with @xmath97 quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering the uncertainties , the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z2mass ] ) is also compatible with the observed @xmath1 resonance mass . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no definite conclusion can be drawn for this state from the present analysis .    </S>",

    "<S> we have presented a qcdsr analysis of the two - point function for possible @xmath25 and @xmath99 molecular states with @xmath35 and @xmath97 respectively . for the @xmath25 molecule with @xmath35 we got a mass around 130 mev above the @xmath9 threshold , and around 100 mev above the observed @xmath1 mass . in the case of the @xmath99 molecule with @xmath100 we got a mass around 100 mev below the @xmath11 threshold , and around 60 mev smaller than the observed @xmath2 mass . in ref .  @xcite it was found that the inclusion of the width , in the phenomenological side of the sum rule , increases the obtained mass for molecular states . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the introduction of the width in our calculation , will increase the mass of the @xmath25 and @xmath99 molecules . as a result </S>",

    "<S> such configuration will lead to a @xmath6 state as the naive s - wave decay of @xmath104 would imply . in the case of the @xmath99 state , although from the present analysis its mass is compatible with both , the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 resonance - like structures , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown that considering a width @xmath105 and @xmath106 the mass obtained for the @xmath99 state is @xmath107 , in an excelent agreement with the @xmath2 mass . therefore , their conclusion is that it is possible to describe the @xmath2 resonance structure as a @xmath11 molecular state with @xmath97 quantum numbers . </S>"
