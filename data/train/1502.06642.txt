    "coupling of electromagnetic radiation into enclosures or cavities through apertures both electrically small @xcite and large @xcite has attracted the interest of electromagnetic community for many years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "full solutions of this problem are particularly complicated because of the mathematical complexity in the solution of the boundary - value problem and because of the sensitivity of the solution to the detail of the enclosure s dimensions , content , and the frequency spectrum of the excitation .",
    "these difficulties have motivated the formulation of a statistical description ( known as the random coupling model , rcm @xcite ) of the excitation of cavities .",
    "the model predicts the properties of the linear relation between voltages and currents at ports in the cavity , when the ports are treated as electrically small antennas .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate and investigate the rcm as it applies to cases in which the ports are apertures in cavity walls .",
    "the aperture is assumed to be illuminated on one side by a plane electromagnetic wave .",
    "we then distinguish between the radiation problem , where the aperture radiates into free space , and the cavity problem , where the aperture radiates into a closed electromagnetic ( em ) environment .",
    "the solution of the problem in the cavity case is then given in terms of the free - space solution and a fluctuation matrix based on random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "thus , there is a clear separation between the system specific aspects of the aperture , in terms of the radiation admittance , and the cavity in terms of the fluctuation matrix .",
    "we illustrate our method by focusing on the problem of an electrically narrow aperture , for which the radiation admittance can be easily calculated numerically .",
    "we then generalize our result to the interesting case where a resonant mode of the aperture is excited . in this case",
    "the statistical properties of the aperture - cavity system can be given in a general universal form .",
    "our results build on previous work on apertures .",
    "in particular , rectangular apertures have a very long research tradition in em theory @xcite , and continue to be a topic of interest @xcite .",
    "the first self - consistent treatments have been carried out by bethe @xcite , bouwkamp @xcite , and , later , by schwinger in aperture scattering @xcite , and roberts @xcite .",
    "subsequent work on apertures is due to ishimaru @xcite , cockrell @xcite , harrington @xcite , and ramat - sahmii @xcite , among other investigators .",
    "our results are of interest for the physical characterization of the radiation coupled into complex cavities such as reverberation chambers ( rc ) - which is known to be an extremely complicated problem even challenging classical emc techniques @xcite - for understanding interference in metallic enclosures , as well as for modeling and predicting radiated emissions in complicated environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we introduce the general model for the cavity backed aperture , and we describe the way the rcm models the cavity . in sec .",
    "we apply the formulation of sec .",
    "ii . to large aspect ratio , rectangular apertures ; evaluating the elements of the admittance matrix and computing the power entering a cavity with a rectangular aperture . in this section",
    "we also develop a simple formula for the power entering a low loss cavity with isolated resonances .",
    "iv . describes an extension of the model that accounts for the coupling of power through an aperture , into a cavity , and to an antenna in the cavity .",
    "simple formulas for the high - loss case , low - loss , isolated resonance are developed .",
    "the random coupling model was originally formulated to model the impedance matrix of quasi - two - planar cavities with single @xcite , and multiple @xcite point - like ports @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we develop the model for three - dimensional _ irregular _ enclosures excited through apertures @xcite . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cav_geo ] , we consider a cavity with a planar aperture in its wall through which our complex electromagnetic system is accessed from the outside .",
    "the size and shape of the aperture are important in our model , their specification constitutes `` system specific '' information that is needed to implement the model .",
    "the cavity that we consider in our studies is an electrically large enclosure with an irregular geometry .",
    "the irregularity is assumed to be such that ray trajectories within the cavity are chaotic throughout @xcite .    generally speaking , typical cavities have this feature ; particularly those with curved walls and/or with contents that scatter radiation in multiple directions .",
    "the consequences of assuming trajectories are chaotic is that the spectra of modes of the cavity have universal statistical properties that are modeled by random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "experiments have been carried out to test the predictions of rcm for quasi - two - dimensional complex enclosures coupled through electrically small ( point - like ) ports @xcite .",
    "experiments have also been carried out in three - dimensional enclosures , and with electrically - large ports @xcite .",
    "when apertures are considered , the port approximation invoked in the original derivation of the rcm is no longer valid , hence we need to consider the field distribution on the aperture surface .",
    "we consider a planar aperture , i.e. , one that is not subject to boundary curvature .",
    "this is consistent with real - world situations such as 3d reverberation chambers ( rcs ) @xcite , where the aperture is generally in a planar boundary .",
    "we first treat the aperture as if it existed in a metal plate separating two infinite half spaces .",
    "we refer to this as the `` free - space '' situation or `` radiation '' case .",
    "suppose the port is treated as an aperture in a planar conductor whose surface normal @xmath0 is parallel to the z - axis .",
    "the components of the fields transverse to @xmath1 in the aperture can be expressed as a superposition of modes ( an example is the set of modes of a waveguide with the same cross sectional shape as the aperture ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the basis mode , ( having only transverse fields ) normalized such that @xmath5 and @xmath0 is the normal , which we take to be in the @xmath1-direction . in the radiation case",
    "we solve maxwells equations in the half space @xmath6 subject to the boundary conditions that @xmath7 on the conducting plane except at the aperture where it is given by ( [ eqn : et_rad_aperture ] ) .",
    "we do this by removing the conducting plane , adding a magnetic surface current density @xmath8 to faradays law , and solving maxwells equations in the whole space @xmath9 in the fourier domain . for this problem ,",
    "the transverse components of the electric field are odd functions of @xmath1 with a jump equal to twice ( [ eqn : et_rad_aperture ] ) at the location of the aperture ; thus satisfying the boundary condition for the half space problem .",
    "we then evaluate the transverse components of the magnetic field on the plane @xmath10 , and project them on to the basis @xmath11 at the aperture to find the magnetic field amplitudes @xmath12 in ( [ eqn : ht_rad_aperture ] ) .",
    "the result is a matrix relation between the magnetic field amplitudes and the electric field amplitudes in the aperture , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the frequency of excitation and we have adopted the phasor convention @xmath16 . here , the radiation admittance matrix @xmath17 is determined from the fourier transform solution for the fields , and is given in terms of a three dimensional integral over wave numbers , @xmath18 where the dyadic tensor @xmath19 is responsible for coupling two arbitrary modes of the aperture , and @xmath20 is the fourier transform of the aperture mode .",
    "the elements of the radiation admittance are complex quantities .",
    "the residue at the pole @xmath21 in ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) gives the radiation conductance @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the two dimensional solid angle of the wave vector @xmath24 to be integrated over @xmath25 , and where there appears a modified dyadic tensor @xmath26 +    \\left [ \\left ( \\textbf{k } \\times \\hat{n } \\right ) \\left ( \\textbf{k } \\times \\hat{n } \\right ) / k_{\\perp}^2 \\right ] \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] the radiation conductance is frequency dependent through @xmath27 .",
    "we note that there is an implicit @xmath27 dependence through the fourier transforms of the aperture modes , and we set @xmath28 in ( [ eqn : es_fourier ] ) and ( [ eqn : deltagrad ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) , gives the radiation susceptance .",
    "part of this can be expressed as a principle part integral of the radiation conductance .",
    "however , there is an additional inductive contribution ( @xmath29 ) ( which we term the magnetostatic conductance ) coming from the last term in the parentheses in ( [ eqn : yrad_kern ] ) that contains a factor that cancels the resonant denominator in ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) .",
    "the reactive response of the aperture can be expressed in terms of the cauchy principal value of the radiation conductance ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) , and the previously mentioned inductive contribution , yielding @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for magnetostatic conductance , defined as @xmath32 and where @xmath33 / k^2 $ ] .",
    "we now repeat the process , but assume that the aperture opens into a cavity rather than an infinite half space , the radiation admittance ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) will be replaced by a cavity admittance . in appendix it is shown that under the assumptions that the eigenmodes of the closed cavity can be replaced by superpositions of random plane waves ( berry s hypothesis @xcite ) , and the spectrum of the cavity eigenmodes can be replaced by one corresponding to a random matrix from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite , the statistical properties of the cavity admittance can be represented as @xmath34^{1/2 } \\cdot    \\ushortdw{\\xi } \\cdot \\left [ \\ushortdw{g}^{rad } \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] and the matrix @xmath35 is a universal fluctuation matrix defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a set of eigenvalues of a random matrix drawn from the goe @xcite .",
    "these matrices have positive and negative eigenvalues that fall in a symmetric range about zero .",
    "the mean spacing of the eigenvalues near zero can be adjusted by scaling the size of the matrix elements . here",
    "we assume that this has been done such that the mean spacing of the @xmath37 near zero is unity .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 represents the deviation of the excitation frequency @xmath39 from some reference value @xmath40 placed in the band of interest @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean spacing between the resonant frequencies of modes of the actual cavity in the range of @xmath40 .",
    "the resonant frequencies of a particular realization are thus given by @xmath43 .",
    "the vector @xmath44 is composed of independent , zero mean , unit variance gaussian random variables .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 describes the average loss in the cavity and is related to the finesse parameter @xmath46 , widely used in optical cavities and photonic lattices @xcite @xmath47 thus , according to the rcm , two quantities are required to specify the properties of the cavity : the @xmath48 width @xmath49 and the mean spacing @xmath42 between nearest neighbor resonances ( cavity modes ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 determines whether the cavity is in the high loss ( @xmath50 ) or low loss ( @xmath51 ) regime .",
    "more precisely , it establishes how much the individual resonances overlap .",
    "basically , if @xmath50 the @xmath48-width of a resonance , @xmath49 , exceeds the spacing between resonances @xmath42 .",
    "a feature of chaotic cavities is that each mode in a given frequency band has essentially the same @xmath48-width .",
    "this is a consequence of the ergodic nature of the ray trajectories that underlie the mode structure .",
    "each mode has wave energy distributed throughout the cavity such that losses are approximately the same for each mode .",
    "we now describe how relations ( [ eqn : y_aperture ] ) and ( [ eqn : ycav_fluct ] ) are used to determine the coupling of our system to external radiation .",
    "specifically , we consider the framework of fig .",
    "[ fig : ap_geo ] , where the aperture is illuminated by a plane wave incident with a wave vector @xmath52 and polarization of magnetic field @xmath53 that is perpendicular to @xmath52 .",
    "we again consider the aperture to be an opening in a conducting plane at @xmath54 , with radiation incident from @xmath55 .",
    "we imagine writing the fields for @xmath56 as the sum of the incident wave , the wave that would be specularly reflected from an infinite planar surface , and a set of outgoing waves associated with the presence of the aperture .",
    "the incident and specularly reflected waves combine to produce zero tangential electric field on the plane @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the outgoing waves for @xmath56 associated with the aperture can be expressed in terms of the electric fields in the aperture just as the outgoing waves for @xmath6 can , the two cases being mirror images .",
    "so , relation ( [ eqn : et_rad_aperture ] ) continues to represent the tangential electric fields in the plane @xmath10 .",
    "for the magnetic field we have separate expansions for @xmath6 and @xmath56 .",
    "the electric field amplitudes are then determined by the condition that the magnetic fields are continuous in the aperture at @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath57 we have @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is either the radiation admittance matrix ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) or the cavity admittance matrix ( [ eqn : ycav_fluct ] ) depending on the circumstance .",
    "for @xmath61 we have @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 ( the minus sign accounts for the mirror symmetry ) and the factor of two multiplying the incident field comes from the addition of the incident and specularly reflected magnetic fields .",
    "projecting the two magnetic field expressions on the aperture basis , and equating the amplitudes gives @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the fourier transform of the aperture electric field and is defined in ( [ eqn : es_fourier ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : radiation_aperture ] ) can be inverted to find the vector of voltages @xmath67 and then the net power passing through the aperture is given by @xmath68 where @xmath60 can be either a radiation ( free - space ) admittance ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) or a cavity admittance matrix ( [ eqn : ycav_fluct ] ) .",
    "we consider rectangular apertures and select a basis for representation of the tangential fields in the aperture in ( [ eqn : et_rad_aperture ] ) and ( [ eqn : ht_rad_aperture ] ) .",
    "one choice for the basis are the modes of a waveguide with a rectangular cross section .",
    "these can be written either as a sum of te and tm modes , or simply as a fourier representation of the individual cartesian field components @xcite @xcite .    in emc studies , narrow apertures",

    "once the aperture field basis is specified , the procedure for calculating the cavity admittance matrix ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) is given by the following steps @xcite .",
    "first , calculate the fourier transform @xmath76 ( [ eqn : es_fourier ] ) .",
    "second , use @xmath77 to calculate the radiation conductance ( [ eqn : grad_aperture ] ) .",

    "fourth , use above quantities to form the radiation susceptance @xmath78 .",
    "finally , use the so - formed radiation admittance to generate the cavity admittance ( [ eqn : ycav_fluct ] ) , similar to @xcite .",
    "the conductance and susceptance have the property that off diagonal terms vanish if @xmath79 is odd and @xmath80 is even , and vice versa , due to the even and odd parity in @xmath81 of the basis modes .",
    "further , in the limit of high frequency , @xmath82 , the components @xmath83 have the limits @xmath84 thus , at high frequencies the admittance matrix @xmath85 is diagonal and equal to the free space conductance as would be expected when the radiation wavelength is much smaller than the aperture size .",
    "we have evaluated the elements of the radiation conductance matrix as functions of frequency for a rectangular aperture with dimensions @xmath86 cm @xmath87 cm .",
    "plots of these appear in figs .",
    "[ fig : gnn_1_7 ] and [ fig : gnn_1_7_inset ] .    for the diagonal elements",
    "the conductance increases nonmonotonically from zero , and asymptotes to its free - space value . for the off - diagonal components ( not shown )",
    "the conductance first rises and then falls to zero with increasing frequency . combining numerical evaluations of the two contributions in ( [ eqn : brad_aperture ] ) yields the total susceptance .",
    "this is plotted for several diagonal elements in fig .",
    "[ fig : brad_1_5 ] , which have the feature that for some elements the susceptance passes through zero at a particular frequency . at these frequencies the conductances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gnn_1_7_inset ] ) also tend to be small .",
    "this indicates the presence of resonant modes of the aperture . at the frequencies of these modes",
    "the aperture will allow more power to pass through the plane of the conductor than would expected based on the aperture area .",
    "our next step is to evaluate the power passing through the aperture when it is illuminated by a plane wave .",
    "this involves solving ( [ eqn : voltage ] ) for the vector of voltages @xmath88 , and inserting these in ( [ eqn : power_back ] ) for the power transmitted through the aperture .",
    "this will be done a number of times ; first with @xmath89 to determine the power passing through the aperture in the radiation case ; then again with @xmath90 to determine the power through the aperture when it is backed by a cavity . in the cavity case",
    "a number of realizations of the cavity admittance matrix will be considered , modeling cavities with different distributions of resonant modes .",

    "interestingly , we notice the presence of a sharp peak at @xmath96 mhz , which is the slit resonance frequency , i.e. , @xmath97 , and other broader resonances located at @xmath98 .    at normal incidence , the peak of the resonance next to the sharp peak is reduced of a factor of @xmath99 .",
    "this is confirmed in previous studies based on the transmission line model of a narrow aperture @xcite .",
    "having computed the radiation conductance and susceptance for a narrow slit of dimensions @xmath100 cm @xmath101 @xmath102 cm , we can investigate the effect of a wave - chaotic cavity backing the aperture by replacing @xmath103 by @xmath104 and exploiting the statistical model , ( [ eqn : ycav_fluct ] ) .",
    "we first calculate distributions of the cavity admittance elements from the rcm by using a monte carlo technique and the radiation admittance of a rectangular aperture .",
    "numerical calculations of ( [ eqn : yrad_aperture ] ) and monte carlo simulation of ( [ eqn : universal_fluct ] ) allow for generating an ensemble of cavity admittances of the form ( [ eqn : ycav_fluct ] ) .",
