    "infrared luminous ( @xmath6 l@xmath7 ) and ultraluminous galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( @xmath8 l@xmath7 ) are believed to be major mergers of massive , gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "they are spectacular systems , related to super - starbursts and massive gas flows to their central regions .",
    "their molecular gas distribution is often found in rotating nuclear disks , toruses or bars only a few hundred pc in extent .",
    "these ulirgs have been suggested as precursors of qsos ( e.g. norman and scoville 1988 ) .",
    "still , galaxies collide that do not have the necessary properties to become ultraluminous objects .",
    "the importance of these intermediate , often minor i.e. unequal - mass mergers , to the general evolution of galaxies is not well understood .",
    "both major and minor mergers undergo bursts of star formation , but the activity seems to take place on a larger linear scale in the minor mergers . whether the starburst processes and triggering mechanisms remain the same for the compact and large scale bursts is unclear .",
    "it appears however , that some of the extended bursts can reach the same high sfes as the ulirgs .",
    "probing the properties and distribution of the molecular ism enables modelling of the triggering and evolution of the starburst . for this purpose , it is necessary to go beyond  and use other ( fainter ) molecular tracers such as the isotopomer  and high dipole moment molecules such as hcn , hnc and cn .",
    "these lines are powerful diagnostic tools , in particular in combination with other extinction - free tracers like ir and radio .    the minor merger , and young shell galaxy , ngc  4194 ( `` the medusa '' ) has an extended region ( 2 kpc ) of intense star formation ( e.g. prestwich  1994 ) which is responsible for most of the fir luminosity ( @xmath9 l@xmath7 at @xmath10=39 mpc ) .",
    "the sfe , @xmath11 , is high , 40 @xmath12 , _ similar to the sfe of the ulirg arp  220_. the global  is large , @xmath13 , indicating a highly excited or disrupted ism ( aalto & httemeister 2000 , ah ) . despite the high sfe , emission from the high density tracer molecule hcn remains undetected in ngc  4194 .",
    "we present a preliminary analysis of the  and  distribution obtained at high resolution with ovro .",
    "we offer an explanation for the apparent lack of dense gas in the medusa and suggest `` cartoon models '' of a high pressure ( ulirg ) and a comparatively low pressure ( medusa ) molecular ism .",
    "since both high kinetic temperatures and large turbulent line widths will decrease the  10 optical depth ( @xmath14 ) , a map of the @xmath0 10 intensity ratio ( ) can be used to identify regions of extreme or unusual physical conditions in the molecular gas .",
    "large ratios indicate low to moderate @xmath14 and aalto  ( 1995 ) established some general diagnostics of the cloud conditions and environment based on global values of : small ratios , @xmath15 are an indication of a normal galactic disk population of clouds dominated by cool giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ; intermediate ratios @xmath16 are associated with the inner regions of normal starburst galaxies ; the extreme values @xmath17 originate in turbulent , _ high pressure _ gas in the centers of luminous mergers . in the most luminous mergers , the gas surface density implied by the galactic conversion factor from  luminosity to m(h@xmath18 )",
    "is well over 10@xmath19  pc@xmath20two orders of magnitude higher than in typical milky way gmcs .",
    "this led aalto  ( 1995 ) to suggest that large values of  are related to the large gas surface densities in compact nuclear starbursts .",
    "large surface densities require high pressures in hydrostatic equilibrium ; as the  @xmath21 line ratios in these objects indicate _ low _",
    "( @xmath22 @xmath5 ) densities of the  emitting gas - component it must be supported by large turbulent line widths ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath14 can be reduced to moderate ( @xmath24 ) values , resulting in large .",
    "however , the global  of the medusa is high , but the gas surface density is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of the ulirgs .",
    "therefore , the pressure will be considerably lower and the ism is likely much less turbulent ( even though it is still significantly higher than the average pressure for the galactic disk ) .",
    "thus , for the medusa , the high  may well be caused by elevated kinetic temperatures rather than large line widths .",
    "there is indeed a strong correlation between fir colour temperature and large values of : galaxies with @xmath17 all have @xmath25 flux ratios @xmath26 ( e.g. aalto  1991 , 1995 ) indicating high average dust temperatures .",
    "thus , large values of  are also related to the effect of the starburst itself , heating dust and gas to high temperatures .",
    "figure 1 shows the  emission overlayed on an r - band image of ngc  4194 .",
    "the  distribution is surprisingly extended , @xmath27 kpc , for an advanced merger even if the bulk ( 60 - 70 % ) of the emission emerges from the 2 kpc starburst region .",
    "the morphology is complex , tracing large - scale dust lanes , one which curves along the north - eastern edge of the main body and continues into the tidal tail , and one which is crossing the central region along the minor axis .",
    "the gas mass ( for a standard co to h@xmath18 conversion factor ) is @xmath28 m@xmath7 ( ah ) . there is substantial variation in  across ngc  4194 : from quiescent values of 7 in the the eastern dust lane 5 kpc from the center , to high values , @xmath120 , in the starburst and central dust lane .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that there is a strong connection between  and gas environment . in figure 2",
    "we show the  and  contours overlayed on an archival hst wfpc2 image of the inner 2 kpc of ngc  4194 . the  and  morphologies differ substantially showing significant variation in also within the central region .",
    "peaks west of , associated with a peculiar dust feature . elevated values of  are found in two regions : a ) througout the extended starburst region and b ) in the curved part of the central dust lane .",
    "the global  is dominated by the starburst region where  is likely elevated because of large kinetic temperatures ( see next section ) . in region",
    "b ) gas streaming may cause local effects of large line widths ( see also httemeister and aalto , this volume ) .",
    ".line ratios in high  starbursts [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the table we list typical line ratios for compact high pressure and extended low pressure starbursts .",
    "both types may have large values of @xmath29 , but their average ism properties differ on several accounts . in figure 3",
    "we show cartoons of the two ism types , `` raisin roll '' and `` fried eggs '' . for the former ( ulirg ) scenario ,",
    "the  emission is emerging from low density @xmath30 @xmath5 diffuse gas of large linewidths and filling factor , while the hcn 1 - 0 emission is coming from dense ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , embedded clouds ( but see e.g. aalto  1995 for a discussion on mid - ir pumping of hcn ) .",
    "the bulk of the molecular mass is in the dense gas , but the high value of  can primarily be attributed to the large linewidths of the diffuse molecular gas ( which can remain molecular because of the extreme pressure ) .",
    "galaxies which may be characterised by this ism scenario include arp  220 , ngc  6240 and mrk  231 .",
    "it may seem surprising that the  emitting gas is somewhat denser , @xmath31 @xmath5 , in the lower pressure scenario ( and with a smaller volume filling factor ) .",
    "this may be because ( in contrast to the `` raisin roll '' ism ) the intercloud medium is likely atomic ( or ionized ) since the destructive forces of the newborn stars are not balanced by a high ambient pressure .",
    "thus , the  emitting gas is more `` cloudy '' in the lower pressure model , but the relatively faint hcn emission indicates that the mass fraction of _ high _ density gas , @xmath32 @xmath5 , is considerably lower .",
    "the  emission may , however , be filamentary and not always in bound clouds .",
    "the large value of  is likely caused by elevated gas temperatures ( @xmath33 k ) since the gas is dense enough for  to be thermalized ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the clouds may be pdrs ( photon dominated regions ) if the impact of the starburst is strong enough .",
    "galaxies which may be characterised by this ism scenario include the medusa ( ngc  4194 ) , ugc  2866 and ngc  1614 .",
    "because of its high dipole moment , hcn 1 - 0 emission is often used as a tracer of high density ( @xmath32 @xmath5 ) gas and the @xmath35 line intensity ratio as a measure of the mass fraction of dense gas .",
    "bright hcn ( low @xmath35 ratios ) in ulirgs has been used to argue for a starburst origin of their luminosity ( e.g. solomon , downes and radford 1992 ) because of a global correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is therefore interesting that the sfe of the medusa rivals that of the ulirg arp  220  even though the hcn emission is faint towards ngc  4194 .",
    "how can there be an efficient transformation of gas into stars when there is only little dense gas present ?",
    "the answer may lie in the time the molecular gas spends in a dense phase which is related to the average gas pressure and dynamics .",
    "the medusa starburst takes place in an environment of reduced shear because it occurs inside the region of solid body rotation .",
    "thus , gravitational instability may dominate over tidal shear with a resulting increase in the sfe .",
    "the rate of star formation ( sfr ) is indeed very high , 40 m@xmath7 yr@xmath38 , which is close to the maximum sfr per kpc@xmath39 found by lehnert & heckman ( 1996 ) .",
    "since the hydrostatic pressure is much lower than in a ulirg , gas is not maintained at high densities , but passes through a dense phase quickly on its way to becoming stars .",
    "the time spent in a dense phase is short and will not be an observed signature of the ism .",
    "the rate of star formation has been found to be dependent on large scale dynamics ( e.g. kenney , carlstrom and young 1993 ) .",
    "perhaps , for a threshold level of the gas surface density , the dynamical environment of the clouds is also important in regulating the _ efficiency _ of star formation , even more so than the relative amount of high density gas",
    ".    for the compact burst in the deep potential well of a massive major merger , the gas surface density ( and matter density ) is high and thus also the ambient pressure leading to large _ average _ gas densities .",
    "still , the dynamical and radiative environment may be unfavourable to star formation . within 200 pc of the deep potential",
    "well of a differentially rotating galaxy with rotational speed 250 , the clouds must have average densities of @xmath32 @xmath5 just to be stable against tidal shearing .",
    "lower density gas will only exist as diffuse unbound clouds .",
    "in addition , the feedback mechanisms of the starburst itself may help regulate the sfe , and these mechanisms may be effective in the densely packed , high gas surface density central regions of ulirgs .",
    "thus , in some circumstances , the gas will remain at substantial average density without forming stars . in this context , the @xmath36 - @xmath37 correlation is , at least partially , caused by high pressure gas being more centrally concentrated than low pressure gas , and that fir emission in galaxies tend to emerge from the inner regions  at least the 60 @xmath40 m emission .",
    "the fir emission may indeed originate in starburst activity , but also from an agn or from an evolved starburst where densely packed stars heat a fragmented ism .",
    "a possible caveat in the notion that the sfe is similar in the medusa and arp  220 is the possibility that the  luminosity is tracing molecular mass differently in a compact and extended starburst .",
    "furthermore , the ulirgs deviate from the limiting sfr per kpc@xmath39 found by lehnert and heckman .",
    "their maximum star formation rates are in the range 100 - 300 m@xmath7 yr@xmath38 instead of 20 - 40  and from a smaller area than less powerful galaxies .",
    "dust opacity and hidden agns may explain some of the discrepancy in the limiting sfrs , but we can not exclude that the underlying star formation mechanisms are different ."
