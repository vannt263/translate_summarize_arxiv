    "one of the most striking consequences of strong correlation in electronic systems is charge fractionalization , where the elementary charged excitations of a system have quantum numbers which differ from those of the bare electron .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect is an ideal arena to study this phenomena@xcite . at filling factor @xmath5 , the elementary excitation of the quantum hall state",
    "is the charge @xmath3 laughlin quasiparticle@xcite .",
    "current experimental techniques allow for a detailed study of the transport properties of these exotic particles .",
    "a powerful technique for probing elementary charge carriers is to measure shot noise .",
    "when particles flow independently with an uncorrelated poisson distribution , their charge is given by the ratio between the mean square fluctuation of the current and the average current@xcite . in 1994",
    "we proposed that a quantum point contact , formed by pinching together the edges of a quantum hall bar , would be an ideal geometry for establishing the uncorrelated flow of laughlin quasiparticles@xcite . when the point contact is strongly pinched off the sample is effectively split into two . in that case",
    "a weak tunneling current must be carried by electrons , and shot noise with charge @xmath6 is expected . however , in the opposite extreme of weak pinch off , quasiparticles can backscatter between the edges through the quantum hall fluid . the ratio between the noise and the backscattered current",
    "is then determined by the charge of the quasiparticle . in seminal 1997 experiments ,",

    "@xcite and saminadayar , et al .",
    "@xcite independently used this technique to measure the charge @xmath7 of the laughlin quasiparticle .",
    "the original experiments used a two terminal setup in which the current and noise transmitted through the point contact were measured .",
    "the backscattered current was determined by taking the difference between the measured current and the current at perfect transmission .",
    "recently , comforti et al.@xcite , have used the three terminal device consisting of two point contacts shown in fig .",
    "1 . consider first the case where the second point contact ( qpc2 ) is completely open , while the first point contact ( qpc1 ) is weakly pinched off . when voltage is applied to lead 1 with leads 2 and 3 grounded , quasiparticles backscattered from qpc1 propagate into lead 3 .",
    "this geometry is superior to the two terminal setup for measuring the quasiparticle charge because the current due to the quasiparticles is isolated in lead 3 .",
    "more interestingly , this may be viewed as a method for generating a _ dilute beam _ of laughlin quasiparticles propagating into lead 3 .",
    "this opens the door to experiments that probe the transport properties of and interactions between individual laughlin quasiparticles .",
    "comforti et al .",
    "@xcite used this technique to study a dilute beam of charge @xmath7 quasiparticles after transmission through the second point contact , qpc2 . by measuring the current and noise in lead 3 , they probed the average charge of the particles transmitted through qpc2 .",
    "surprisingly , they found that even when the transmission of qpc2 was small , of order @xmath8 , the measured transmitted charge @xmath9 was significantly smaller than that of the electron .",
    "this led them to suggest that perhaps the fractionally charged quasiparticles in a dilute beam could traverse a nearly opaque barrier .",
    "this suggestion is at odds with the conventional wisdom on the tunneling of quasiparticles . in the limit of strong pinch off , the quantum hall fluid",
    "is split into two pieces , which each must have an integer number of electrons .",
    "coupling them weakly can only give rise to tunneling of electrons .",
    "any theory that is perturbative in the tunneling of electrons will necessarily give noise corresponding to charge @xmath6 .",
    "nonetheless , it is conceivable that there could be subtle non perturbative effects .",
    "it is well known that a weakly backscattering point contact ( which is _ not _ two independent quantum hall fluids ) will cross over at low energy to a regime in which the average current is well described in terms of the weak tunneling of electrons@xcite .",
    "could the noise in this three terminal setup somehow behave differently ?    in this paper",
    "we calculate the current and shot noise transmitted through the qpc2 into lead 3 for the device in fig .",
    "1 . we employ the chiral luttinger liquid model@xcite with @xmath10 an odd integer .",
    "we treat the quasiparticle backscattering from qpc1 at lowest order in perturbation theory , which guarantees that the quasiparticles are dilute and uncorrelated . for qpc2",
    ", we develop a non perturbative theory , which describes the entire crossover between the weak and strong backscattering limits .",
    "for the special case @xmath1 ( which does not correspond physically to a fqhe edge state ) we present an exact solution using the technique of fermionization . for more general filling factors , @xmath5",
    "we treat the qpc2 perturbatively in the limits of weak tunneling and weak backscattering . to facilitate comparison with experiments which are carried out at finite temperature",
    "we compute the full dependence of the current and noise on temperature and voltage .",
    "this gives the crossover between equilibrium noise for @xmath11 and shot noise for @xmath12 .",
    "our nonperturbative calculation for @xmath13 shows that the answer to the question posed above is unambiguously no .",
    "fractional charges can _ not _ traverse a nearly opaque barrier .",
    "but the situation is even worse - and more interesting .",
    "we find that at strictly zero temperature fractional charges can not even pass through a nearly perfectly transmitting barrier .",
    "specifically , the zero temperature shot noise measured in lead 3 corresponds to charge @xmath6 particles , _ independent _ of the transmission of qpc2 .",
    "thus , only electrons are transmitted through qpc2 _ even when the transmission of current through qpc2 is nearly perfect_. we interpret this result to mean that at zero temperature the transmitted current is dominated by _",
    "andreev _ scattering of the incident quasiparticles : an electron is transmitted , while a hole with the remainder of the quasiparticle s charge is reflected .",
    "this new and unexpected result points to the subtlety of the zero temperature limit for fractionalized particles .",
    "when the backscattering at qpc2 is exactly zero , quasiparticles will obviously be transmitted , and the noise in lead 3 should reflect their fractional charge .",
    "evidently the limits of taking the temperature to zero and taking the backscattering at qpc2 to zero do not commute .",
    "this situation is unusual in nonequilibrium many body physics .",
    "usually , one expects singularities at low energy to be cut off by both temperature and voltage , with the largest energy scale dominating .",
    "by contrast , here we have singular behavior in the zero temperature limit for fixed finite voltage . while we do not have an exact solution for general filling factors , our perturbative analysis gives strong evidence that a similar singularity of the zero temperature limit occurs for @xmath14 .",

    "ii we describe the chiral luttinger liquid model and establish the notation that we will use in the remainder of the paper .",

    "the presence of small , but finite quasiparticle backscattering @xmath71 at qpc2 gives rise to a perturbative correction to the current and noise .",

    "the scaling functions @xmath153 and @xmath154 are calculated in appendix a.3 and b.2 .",
    "the results are quite unusual .",

    "we find that @xmath158 goes to a _ constant _ at large @xmath156 .",
    "this means that perturbation theory in @xmath71 breaks down for @xmath38 even for fixed finite @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath159 the effective charge is given by , @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a positive constant given explicitly in appendix b. clearly the correction to @xmath162 diverges for @xmath38 . in the following section we will show that for @xmath1 , @xmath163 at @xmath2 for arbitrarily small but finite @xmath71 .",
    "it is quite likely that this conclusion holds generally for all values of @xmath152 .",

    "b6 ) . in the limit of low temperature ( or large backscattering at qpc2 ) the results of the exact calculation",
    "reduce to the results of perturbation theory based on the weak tunneling of electrons .",
    "moreover , comparing fig . 2a and 2b ,",
    "it is clear that when the transparency is small , the effective charge ( for @xmath261 sufficiently large ) is very close to @xmath262 .",

    "2a the transparency increases with increasing @xmath261 and eventually approaches 1 .",
    "this is because the transmission through qpc2 becomes perfect for @xmath263 .",
    "by contrast , the curves for the effective charge in fig . 2b saturate at a constant value for @xmath264 .",
    "thus , even though the transmission through qpc2 @xmath265 is perfect , the charge @xmath266 of the transmitted particles is _ not _ equal to the charge @xmath267 of the quasiparticles incident on qpc2 , but rather varies between @xmath267 and @xmath262 as the temperature is lowered . in striking contrast , at zero temperature equations ( 4.23 ) and ( 4.31 )",
    "show that the effective charge of the transmitted particles @xmath268 , independent of the voltage @xmath29 .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath269 and @xmath270 thus show qualitatively different behavior .",
    "this is quite unusual , since usually the dependence of scaling functions on voltage and temperature are qualitatively similar .",
    "the origin of this behavior can be traced to the singular behavior of limit @xmath38 with fixed @xmath29 : @xmath271 the limits of @xmath38 and @xmath148 do not commute .    in section vb we will offer a physical interpretation of this peculiar behavior .",
    "however , before doing so it is important to ask whether it is an artifact of the chiral edge theory for @xmath272 , or whether it also occurs more generally . in fig .",
    "3 we show perturbative calculations of @xmath273 ( eq . 3.3 ) and @xmath274 ( eqs . 3.21 , 3.16 , b.4 ) . it seems quite plausible that for intermediate temperatures @xmath275 should interpolate smoothly between the two limits as in fig .",

    "the small @xmath71 perturbation theory also gives a diverging correction to the transparency at zero temperature ( eq .",
    "this divergence was absent for @xmath13 .",
    "one may therefore worry that the transparency also goes to zero at @xmath2 for fixed @xmath29 .",
    "however , this is contradicted by the small @xmath107 perturbation theory ( 3.14,3.18 ) , which gives a finite transparency @xmath282 at @xmath2 .",
    "it is most likely that the divergence for small @xmath71 signifies that transparency is not analytic at @xmath69 .",
    "such a non analyticity also occurs for @xmath1 , where ( 4.23 ) gives @xmath283 .",
    "the above arguments give strong evidence that the singular behavior at @xmath2 that we have established for @xmath260 also occurs for @xmath284 and other laughlin filling fractions .",
    "nonetheless , it would be desirable to obtain a full solution for @xmath14 . using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , fendley , ludwig and saleur@xcite",
    "have calculated the current and noise for a single point contact , accounting for the full crossover between the weak backscattering and strong backcattering limits .",
    "it should be possible to generalize their formalism to the present 3-terminal geometry .",
    "in this section we attempt to make sense out of the peculiar behavior we have established at zero temperature .",
    "we wish to understand how electrons can be transmitted through qpc2 into lead 3 even when the transparency of qpc2 is nearly perfect .",
    "we assume here that this effect occurs for @xmath285 .    at zero",
    "temperature quasiparticles backscattered by qpc1 come in wave packets of charge @xmath3 and duration @xmath286 at a rate @xmath287 . for @xmath288",
    "the quasiparticle wave packets are independent and can be considered one at a time .",
    "the interaction of a quasiparticle with qpc2 presents a scattering problem . when a quasiparticle scatters from qpc2 it is natural to ask what comes out . unlike the non interacting electron version of this problem",
    "the number of quasiparticles is not necessarily conserved in this scattering process .",
    "however , the total charge is conserved .",
    "we consider three processes .",
    "( 1 ) the quasiparticle is transmitted with probability t into lead 3 .",
    "( 2 ) the quasiparticle is reflected with probability r into lead 1 .",
    "( 3 ) the quasiparticle is _ andreev reflected _ with probability a. in this process an electron , with charge @xmath6 is transmitted into lead 3 while a hole with charge @xmath289 is reflected into lead 1 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if these are the only allowed processes ( i.e. @xmath290 ) the transparency is given by , @xmath291 moreover , the effective charge will be , @xmath292    for @xmath293 we clearly have @xmath294 and @xmath295 . on the other hand , at zero temperature",
    "our noise calculation shows that @xmath296 , since only electrons were found to be transmitted into lead 3 .",
    "the transmitted current is thus apparently dominated by andreev processes .",
    "this is no surprise in the large barrier limit @xmath297 , where @xmath67 is small , so that @xmath298 is small and @xmath299 . in the small barrier limit @xmath300",
    ", however , we have @xmath301 .",
    "this then implies that @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "thus , quite remarkably , the incident quasiparticle is either reflected or andreev reflected with probabilities that have saturated at values which conspire to give _ perfect _ transmission of the _ current_. moreover , in this limit the time averaged current backscattered off qpc2 _ vanishes _ , although it will be noisy as we now detail .",
    "a key feature of the andreev processes is that the transmitted and reflected currents are _",
    "these correlations give an unambiguous signature in the noise .",
    "we therefore propose that the noise be measured in _ both _ leads 1 and 3",
    ". it may be desirable to add an additional lead between leads 1 and 3 which can isolate the current reflected at qpc2 . in any case",
    ", this will not affect the following zero temperature predictions .",
    "as above , the noise measured in lead 3 should reflect the charge @xmath6 of the andreev transmitted electrons , @xmath304 the noise measured in lead 1 , however , will be a combination of the charge @xmath25 reflected quasiparticles and the charge @xmath305 andreev reflected holes . in terms of the measured currents , it will be given by @xmath306 here @xmath307 is the current flowing into lead 1 due to the reflections from qpc2 , that is @xmath308 .",
    "if an additional lead , say lead 4 , is present between leads 1 and 3 , then for @xmath309 one would have simply @xmath307 replaced by @xmath310 in equation ( 5.5 ) .",
    "the cross correlations are determined solely by the andreev processes , @xmath311 in the limit of weak pinch off for qpc2 , we have @xmath312 , at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the current flowing into lead 1 is noisy , with @xmath313 .",
    "thus , in this way one can prepare a noisy but zero time - averaged non - equilibrium current , present in the zero temperature limit where equilibrium current fluctuations vanish .",
    "while undoubtedly challenging , it would be fascinating to detect this effect and the presence of andreev processes more generally .",
    "we close by commenting briefly on the implications of our results for the experiments of comforti et al.@xcite .",
    "it is clear that our results give no support to the notion of fractional charges traversing a nearly opaque barrier .",
    "so the interpretation of the data remains a puzzle .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to point out some possible sources of discrepancy .",
    "the exact scaling functions for @xmath1 which we have computed",
    "are strictly speaking only applicable for a point contact which backscatters high energy ( but still below the bulk fqhe gap ) incident particles only weakly .",
    "a point contact which is strongly pinched off will not generally follow the universal crossover between weak and strong backscattering embodied in the scaling functions .",
    "nevertheless , since our results show an absence of any subtle non - perturbative effects in the limit of weak tunneling through the point contact , it is difficult to imagine that this could modify our basic conclusion that only electrons can traverse an opaque barrier .",
    "it seems plausible that the experimentally observed charge of @xmath314 is a finite temperature crossover effect , which might well revert to a charge of @xmath6 as the temperature is lowered further .",
    "but it remains difficult reconciling a transmitted charge well below the electron charge for a point contact with such a small measured transparency of only @xmath8 .",
    "comforti et al .",
    "@xcite extracted the effective charge by fitting the measured @xmath315 and @xmath316 to an  independent particle model \" , which is essentially the non interacting electron version ( @xmath141 ) of the scaling functions @xmath317 and @xmath318@xcite . in fig .",
