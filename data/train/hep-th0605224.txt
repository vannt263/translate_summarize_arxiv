    "namely , this factor has the expected form from the hawking radiation .",
    "the differences left are the minor ones ( for instance , just the overall factor due to the difference in the boundary condition @xmath46 and so on . )",
    "we have investigated how information about the singularity inside the btz black hole formed by gravitational collapse is restored from the boundary correlator . a model of timelike singularity",
    "is artificially constructed to represent the information as one - parameter family of boundary conditions .",
    "when initial quantum state is restricted to a vacuum state , the parameter @xmath46 is restored from the asymptotic behavior of the correlator .",
    "when it is not restricted , it is not clear whether we can derive the information since we can not observe the whole initial data .",
    "if the correlator is _ degenerate _ on the boundary of spacetime , we can not derive the information . in the previous section ,",
    "we show that the boundary correlator is not degenerate for a particular class of excited states .",
    "this may imply that one can still derive the information about singularity inside an ads black hole via boundary correlators .",
    "but we are not able to study the issue for generic excited states , so the result is not conclusive .",
    "let us consider the above issue in the framework of the finite temperature ads / cft correspondence .",
    "originally , the ads / cft correspondence is defined in euclidean signature , but one may analytically continue it in lorentzian signature . in this case , a vacuum state is naturally selected by the analytic continuation .",
    "thus , the euclidean prescription of ads / cft can restrict initial quantum states in lorentzian signature .",
    "by such a restriction , it may be possible to derive the information about singularity inside an ads black hole although the prescription does not pick up a unique initial state .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is special in this sense and probably it is in this sense that the boundary theory can encode information behind the horizon .",
    "the analytic continuation is also possible for an ads black hole formation if one uses a time - symmetric ads black hole .",
    "( the analytic continuation must be performed on the time - symmetric cauchy surface as seen in the maximally extended ads - schwarzschild spacetime @xcite . )",
    "figure  [ tisy ] shows the penrose diagram of an ads black hole formed by the gravitational collapse of a dust shell .",
    "again one would place the timelike singularity parametrized by @xmath46 at @xmath37 in the spacetime .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 would appear in the asymptotic behavior of the boundary correlators and one could extract the information since the allowed initial quantum state on @xmath139 is restricted . note",
    "that this timelike singularity is part of the euclidean spacetime as well ; from the euclidean point of view , this is the reason why the information can be encoded in the boundary correlators . on the contrary",
    ", this spacetime also has a spacelike singularity , but the spacelike singularity is not part of the euclidean spacetime .",
    "thus , extracting the information of the spacelike singularity is a completely different issue ; analyticity seems to play a key role@xcite .",
    "current knowledge of the ads / cft correspondence is not enough to completely resolve the singularity problem . in particular",
    ", we consider the @xmath140-wave sector in the btz black hole background , but the @xmath141 correspondence is probably least understood among the ads / cft in various dimensions .",
    "some aspects are explored , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs .",
    "most references consider the near - horizon limit of the extreme four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole , and one encounters various difficulties .",
    "we expect similar problems in our case as well if we seriously try to understand the correspondence in the @xmath142 context since our spacetime is really asymptotically @xmath143 in disguise .",
    "probably the jackiw - teitelboim black hole is consistently understood only in the zero mass limit in the @xmath141 context .",
    "one obvious approach to overcome this problem is to go back to three dimensions and use the @xmath144 correspondence .",
    "for example , one may compute the correlators of a three - dimensional scalar field propagating on the btz black hole formed by the gravitational collapse . in this case",
    ", the correlator will involve an infinite sum due to the infinite number of images , so the expressions may be more complicated than the one here .",
    "moreover , the finite temperature ads / cft correspondence is not well - understood quantitatively compared with zero temperature one . precise correspondence between the bulk and the boundary theories is not known .",
    "we do not pursue this issue in this paper but it is important .",
    "strong coupling dynamics for finite temperature gauge theories is in general intractable . in order to overcome the difficulty , hydrodynamic description of gauge theory plasmas using the ads / cft correspondence may be useful since experiments and other tools ( such as lattice calculations ) are available there .",
    "we would like to thank a. hosoya for discussions .",
    "the research of m.n .  was supported in part by the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( 13135224 ) from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan .",
    "in order to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - calw ] ) in the black hole region , we introduce @xmath145 as p():=+c . by using the fact =",
    ", one can replace the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - calw ] ) with the following contour integration in the complex @xmath146 plane ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) ) : [ contour - eq ] w()&= & _ c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4dz + & -&_n=0^|_z=2n+1 + & = & _ c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4dz + & & + || + ( ) .",
    "since @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 contour integrations disappear in the large @xmath151 limit  ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "the integration along @xmath153 reduces to _ c_4 & = & ^_- + & & - ( ) |_z=0 + & = & ^_0- , where we removed a singularity at @xmath154 by adding an @xmath155-independent term ; this does not affect the value of @xmath94 .",
