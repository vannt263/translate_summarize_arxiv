    "the mechanics of locomotion at small scales is receiving increasing attention in the recent literature .",
    "this is due both to the intrinsic interest in the detailed understanding of the locomotion strategies of small biological organisms @xcite and in the interest in reproducing them in artificial , bio - inspired artefacts @xcite . depending on whether self - propulsion forces arise from the mechanical interactions of the locomotor with a surrounding fluid , or with a solid substrate",
    ", motility occurs by either swimming or crawling , and these are the main motility modes at microscopic scales @xcite .",
    "the study of crawling at microscopic scales is often motivated by the interest in cell motility and spreading @xcite . in another stream of research ,",
    "limbless locomotion has attracted interest as a new paradigm for robotic locomotion in very rough and complex environments or on uneven terrains @xcite . besides the engineering interest in view of the possible technological applications ( rescue robotics , industrial inspection , medical endoscopy )",
    ", the comparison of the behaviour of biological organisms with robotic replicas is particularly fruitful in that it promotes a synthetic , functionalist view of biological and bio - inspired motility , in which the essential necessary ingredients can be identified , and the way they interact can be studied in detail @xcite .",
    "one of the themes that emerges naturally from the studies above is the identification of the mechanisms of minimal complexity that are able to produce nonzero net displacements by exploiting periodic shape changes . in swimming micro - motility ,",
    "when the size of the swimmer is sufficiently small and the induced flows are characterized by low reynolds numbers ( re ) , net displacements can be obtained only through non - reciprocal shape changes .",
    "this fact is known as the scallop theorem in the micro - swimming literature @xcite .",
    "a geometric view emphasizing how the key to self - propulsion for low re swimmers resides in performing closed loops in the space of shapes is discussed in @xcite , pursuing ideas pioneered in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have shown in recent work that many ideas emerged in the context of low re swimmers can be useful also in the crawling setting @xcite .",
    "a question that is particularly intriguing is whether , by exploiting sufficiently nonlinear interactions with a substrate one may _",
    "beat _ the scallop theorem , and achieve non zero net displacement for a locomotor that can only change shape in a reciprocal manner , through breathing - like deformations .",
    "such deformations are represented by an open curve in the space of shapes , traveled forward and backward .",
    "while such shape changes produce zero net displacements in low re swimming , this is no longer the case for crawlers on solid substrates , provided that the frictional interactions with the substrate are directional @xcite . a detailed study of the motion of model crawlers exploiting distributed , directional interactions is contained in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show how such a system can be realized in practice , and how a simple model of the type studied in @xcite can be adequate to analyse its behaviour , resolving in a satisfactory way both the kinematics of the gait and its energetics .     and mass @xmath0 , interacting with a groove - textured substrate by means of two inclined , flexible bristles .",
    "due to the inclination of the elastic bristles , the frictional interaction arising at the crawler / substrate interface is directional in nature .",
    "notice that the system is externally subject only to vertical gravitational loads.,width=557 ]    in this study , we shall consider the prototypical crawler shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bristle - crawler ] .",
    "the system comprises an initially horizontal segment of current length @xmath1 and mass @xmath0 , interacting with a groove - textured surface by means of two inclined , flexible bristles .",
    "the inclination of the bristles by the angle @xmath2 gives rise to directional frictional interactions , such that reciprocal length changes of the crawler body lead to its advancement on the substrate .",
    "ours is only one of the possible choices to produce an effective frictional interaction with a force - velocity relation that is not odd .",
    "for example , one could texture the crawler instead of the substrate , and many alternative designs can be pursued based , for instance , on the bio - inspired surfaces reviewed in @xcite .    in the following , we will explore the crawler s motility both via direct experimentation and via finite element computations .",
    "these analyses will lead to the definition of a simplified , one - dimensional model capable of resolving both the kinematics and the energetics of the system being analysed .",
    "the focus of our paper is on the net displacements that can be extracted from the most elementary form of cyclic shape changes , namely , reciprocal breathing - like deformations .",
    "previous studies in the literature had mostly focused on peristaltic locomotion , where shape changes consist in traveling waves of extension or contraction @xcite , a mechanism requiring a much more sophisticated level of spatio - temporal coordination .",
    "however , we share with these studies the interest in clarifying the basic aspects in the modelling of frictional interactions with a substrate , a necessary preliminary step on the way to obtain reliable models for the design of self - propelled micro - robots , bio - inspired by the crawling motility of invertebrate organisms .",
    "in this section , we begin the analysis of the _ bristle - crawler _ sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : bristle - crawler ] by direct experimentation .",
    "the experimental setting employed in the study is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-1 ] .",
    "it comprises a prototype of the robotic crawler , positioned on a groove - textured substrate and actuated by means of a shape - memory - alloy ( sma ) spring , an array of three fans , employed to enhance the convective cooling of the actuating coil , and the control / acquisition electronics .",
    "20mm.,width=585 ]    all the components of the crawler s body were obtained using a egx-600 cnc machine from roland corporation to engrave a 10 mm thick plate of transparent pmma , whereas the supports for the flexible bristles were realized with a 3ds project 3510 hd printer to provide an inclination of @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , a mold was 3d - printed for the preparation of the flexible bristles with a shore a 40 silicone rubber .",
    "a tapered shape was chosen for the bristles in order to ensure interlocking between their tips and the substrate grooves : the cross section of @xmath4 at the bristle clamp linearly decreases to a cross section of @xmath5 at the bristle tip , for an overall length of 5 mm . specifically , see fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-1](b)-(c ) , the prototype crawler , of overall mass 55 g and distance between the bristles 100 mm , was designed symmetric about the anterior - posterior vertical plane , and each of its sides simply comprises two segments sliding side by side to provide a maximum shortening @xmath6 20 mm via the resistive heating of the sma actuator . the preparation of the textured substrate also required the use of the cnc machine to engrave evenly spaced rectangular symmetric grooves 1 mm wide and 0.25 mm deep in a 3 mm thick plate of white pmma .    for the actuation of the robotic crawler a sma tension spring",
    "was chosen as a lightweight and compact solution .",
    "this was purchased from jameco electronics and comprises 20 active coils with an outer diameter of 6 mm and a wire diameter of 0.75 mm .",
    "its connection to the crawler body was achieved by means of two ending hooks .",
    "the shortening mechanism of the crawler was designed in such a way that its contraction implies the extension of two rubber bands , which act as antagonist , restoring elements for the sma spring .",
    "each trial was carried out at room temperature ( 22c ) and with the three fans ( from jamicon electronics , model jf0925 - 1ur ) running at 3500rpm .",
    "the displacement at the left and right ends of the crawler was measured with two triangulation , non - contact laser transducers ( from kyence , model il-300 ) simultaneously sampled at a rate of 100s / s via a crio-9082 from national instruments endowed with a ni-9215 ai module .",
    "this allowed for the determination of the crawler position , namely the displacement of its right hand side @xmath7 , as a function of its shortening @xmath8 .",
    "the acquired shortening @xmath8 was also exploited as feedback for a closed - loop control implemented on the fpga of the crio-9082 . in fact , at the beginning of each test an electric current of 3.5a was delivered to the sma actuator through two tiny and flexible cables connected to a home - made amplifier , operating in commutation mode and controlled by a ni-9472 do module , while monitoring the crawler shortening .",
    "when the shortening @xmath8 attained the peak value of 20 mm , the delivery of electric current was stopped by the control loop , allowing the robotic crawler to re - extend thanks the convective cooling provided by the fans .",
    "again , the shortening @xmath8 was monitored and no current was delivered to the actuator until the crawler returned to its original length .",
    "this cycle was repeated at least 5 times during each trial , and any individual stretching cycle approximately required a time of 20s .     as a function of its shortening @xmath9 .",
    "five stretching cycles are reported , corresponding to a net advancement of approximately 82 mm .",
    "notice the changes in the slope of the diagram along the contraction and re - extension branches .",
    "these are due to the transitions between the _ stick _ and _ slip _ regimes of the two bristles .",
    "the advancement for each cycle is approximately @xmath10 of the available shortening of 20 mm , a fact arising from the flexibility of the bristles.,width=472 ]    the experimental analysis of the _ bristle - crawler _ allowed for the precise determination of its motile behaviour . during each trial we observed , as expected , a rightwards motion of the system , with the two bristles sliding at different times in the direction of less resistance ( i.e. , along the grain of the texture )",
    "this is also clearly visible from the movie provided in the electronic supplementary material ( part i ) , which was taken with a digital camera eos 6d from canon , equipped with a ef 24 - 105 mm 1:4 l is usm objective . in particular , the movie shows the results of two distinct trials , carried out for an inclination @xmath2 of the bristles of @xmath11 and 0 , respectively . the second trial , with vertical bristles ,",
    "was performed in order to experimentally prove the significance of the bristles inclination to directional interactions .",
    "in fact , for @xmath12 , the motion of the system is characterized by almost symmetric oscillations about its middle point , so that no appreciable net advancement was observed during the test .    the crawler s advancement , namely , the displacement @xmath7 of its right hand side , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-2 ] as a function of the shortening @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , five stretching cycles are reported and these are highlighted in the figure .",
    "we notice that the net advancement arising from the five cycles approximately equals 82 mm , and this is also the mean value measured from the experiments with a deviation of @xmath13 1 mm .",
    "thus , the advancement arising from each stretching cycle is always smaller than the maximum available shortening of 20 mm .",
    "the inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-2 ] , together with the snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-3 ] , provide a rather clear explanation for that .",
    "in fact , during each cycle the crawler experiences two distinct regimes , related to a _ stick - slip _ behaviour of the bristles . during contraction ,",
    "the two bristles initially deform elastically and their tips are at rest ( the two bristles _ stick _ ) . upon attainment of a critical shortening , the left bristle slides rightwards , whereas the other one keeps its position ( _ slip _ of the left bristle and _ stick _ of the right one ) .",
    "likewise , during re - extension the two bristles are first elastically deformed in the opposite direction with their tips at rest ( _ stick _ of the two bristles ) , and then the right bristle slides rightwards , whereas the other one keeps again its position ( _ stick _ of the left bristle and _ slip _ of the right one ) .",
    "it turns out that the flexibility of the two bristles which mediate the interaction with the substrate significantly affects the crawler motility .",
    "indeed , a part of the available shortening is spent in each cycle , both during contraction and re - extension , to bend elastically the bristles before sliding of their tips can take place .     and after the re - extension to the original length .",
    "notice that vertical , dashed lines are drawn to highlight the displacement of the left and right extremities of the crawler s body .",
    "the last picture of each cycle is repeated for clarity as the first one of the following cycle.,width=648 ]    the two regimes experienced by the crawler can be easily detected from the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-2 ] , where the transition between _ stick _ and _ slip _ of the bristles typically corresponds to an evident change in the slope of the diagram along the contraction and re - extension branches .",
    "this is less visible during the first contraction due to the fact that , at the beginning of the test , the two bristles are almost unloaded and subject only to vertical , gravitational forces , whereas , at the beginning of all the following branches , the two bristles are always in a state of horizontal preloading .",
    "snapshots of the crawler position during a typical test are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp-3 ] .",
    "specifically , five stretching cycles are shown for direct comparison with fig .  [",

    "the experimental analysis of the _ bristle - crawler _ allowed for the determination of the key mechanisms behind its kinematics .",
    "we extend now our study via numerical computations , by setting a finite element model capable of reproducing all the features of the crawler s motility that were observed during direct experimentation .",
    "the commercial software abaqus standard 6.13 - 2 was employed to run the analyses .",
    "specifically , the crawler body was modeled as a horizontal connector of type conn2d2 with initial length of 100 mm , whereas the elastic bristles were modelled with two - nodes b21 beam elements .",
    "their tapered shape was taken into account and , to this purpose , each bristle was discretized by means of hundred finite elements of variable cross section for an overall length of 5 mm . with respect to the material properties , a young s modulus of 1.1mpa ,",
    "a poisson s ratio of 0.45 and a mass density of 1.3g / cm^3 were chosen for the shore a 40 silicone rubber , and viscous dissipation was accounted for by means of rayleigh mass - proportional damping corresponding to a damping - ratio of 0.15 at the first resonant frequency .",
    "the flexible bristles were fixed to the crawler s body by means of rigid , vertical links ending at the extremities of the horizontal connector , where two point masses of 27.5 g each were also attached to account for the overall inertia of the system ( these are depicted as black spots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fem-2 ] , where also the discretization described above can be recognized ) .",
    "the textured substrate was introduced in the model as an analytical rigid surface , resembling the precise geometry employed in the experiments , and coulomb dry friction was assumed at the contact between the bristles and the rigid surface .",
    "remarkable agreement between the numerical predictions and the experimental results was obtained for a friction coefficient of 0.65 , consistently with the properties of the two materials in contact .",
    "each finite element analysis comprised two steps and both were run in a nonlinear , large deformation framework taking into account inertial effects .",
    "the crawler , positioned on the textured surface , was first subject to vertical gravitational loads ( step 1 ) , and then periodic shape changes were prescribed to the horizontal connector by means of a user subroutine disp ( step 2 ) , with imposed shortening @xmath15 , with a peak value @xmath16 20 mm and a period @xmath17 20s .",
