    "chain models , such as the spin@xmath0 heisenberg models xyz and xxz@xcite and their extensions@xcite , the one - dimensional hubbard model@xcite etc ... , have attracted intense interest due to their property of integrability .",
    "we also have other models like the one - dimensional _ d - p _ model@xcite and its generalizations@xcite , employed to simulate a _ cu - o _ linear chain with strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "these models are also relevant because they may explain high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the solution of the xxz model@xcite and the one - dimensional hubbard model@xcite at @xmath1 are examples of the success of the bethe ansatz . in 1972",
    "takahashi and suzuki@xcite obtained the exact thermodynamics of the xxz model .",
    "more recently the same results were re - obtained by kuniba _",
    "et al._@xcite using the quantum transfer matrix approach .",
    "the exact thermodynamics of the one - dimensional hubbard model was also derived by this same method@xcite . in all those models",
    "the thermodynamic functions are solutions of integral coupled equations , and it is possible to obtain their behavior in the very high temperature limit .",
    "however , it is not an easy task to derive a systematic temperature expansion for the thermodynamic functions in such temperature range .    the high temperature limit of any model can be obtained by a standard expansion in terms of the inverse of temperature @xmath2@xcite , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath5 is the absolute temperature .",
    "sometimes , perturbation theory can be applied to obtain the coefficients of the @xmath2-expansion method ; this approach is also called the high temperature expansion and it has been applied to the _ t - j _",
    "model@xcite and to the hubbard model@xcite . in all standard high temperature expansions we always need to calculate the weight of each graph in the grand canonical partition function as well as to determine all graphs that contribute at a given @xmath2-order term .",

    "we applied it to the one - dimensional hubbard model@xcite .",
    "we have two drawbacks in our method : a large number of graphs must be calculated , as well as to count the number of times each graph contributes to each @xmath2-term in the expansion of @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the study of translationally invariant chain models with first neighbors interactions and subject to periodic boundary condition . instead of calculating the grand canonical partition function",
    ", we derive a @xmath2-expansion for the grand potential per site , that is an intensive quantity .",
    "the coefficient of order @xmath7 is exactly obtained for arbitrary values of @xmath8 .",
    "the proposed approach is not restricted to self - interacting fermionic models .    in section 2 , we expand the grand canonical partition function as a taylor series around @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the idea behind this method was previously developed , up to order @xmath10 , in reference @xcite for fermions only . here",

    "a we explain our graphic representation of the normalized traces ; in appendix b we extend our results for @xmath15 with arbitrary @xmath8 ; in appendix c we write the grand potential per site in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath16 that is constructed only from open connected sub - chains ; and finally in appendix d we write the function @xmath17 as sums of normalized traces for @xmath8 up to @xmath18 .",
