    "the distribution of the gravitating mass in galaxy cluster is the key ingredient to use them as astrophysical laboratories and cosmological probes ( see e.g. allen , evrard & mantz 2011 , kravtsov & borgani 2012 ) . in the present favourite @xmath3 scenario ,",
    "galaxy clusters are dominated by dark matter ( 80% of the total mass ) , with a contribution in the form of hot plasma emitting in x - ray and detectable through the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz , sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) effect ( about 15% of the total mass , i.e. @xmath4 ) and the rest in stars ( few per cent ; see e.g. gonzalez et al .",
    "although an intriguing and plausible explanation to the observed gravitational effects induced from galaxy clusters , the still unknown nature of the dark matter invites to consider alternative scenarios .    in this paper , we present and discuss the application of one such alternative model , the `` emergent gravity '' theory proposed recently in verlinde ( 2016 ) , to the mass distribution in x - ray luminous galaxy clusters .",
    "the `` emergent gravity '' theory is a theoretical framework in which spacetime and gravity emerge together from the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory .",
    "although a description of the cosmology is not yet available for this theory , where , in the approximation used by verlinde , the dark energy dominates our universe and ordinary matter only leads to small perturbations , the use of an effective @xmath3 background cosmology to convert from angular to physical scales is still a reasonable approximation at the low redshift regime where we operate . for the @xmath3 model , we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 . in a similar context , the `` emergent gravity '' theory has already shown a good capability to reproduce the observed signal of the galaxy - galaxy lensing profiles ( brouwer et al .",
    "2016 ) and the velocity dispersion profiles of eight dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way ( diez - tejedor et al . 2016 ) .    in this study",
    ", we refer often to radii , @xmath8 , and masses , @xmath9 , that are the corresponding values estimated at the given overdensity @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the critical density of the universe at the observed redshift @xmath13 of the cluster , and @xmath14^{0.5}$ ] is the value of the hubble constant at the same redshift .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we describe the `` emergent gravity '' scenario and how an apparent dark matter distribution can be associated to the observed baryonic mass . in section  3 , we present the dark matter profiles reconstructed through techniques based on x - ray and sz data only in two massive galaxy clusters that are part of the x - cop sample , an _ xmm - newton _  large program which targets the outer regions of a sample of 13 massive clusters in the redshift range @xmath15 at uniform depth . in section  4 , we compare the dark matter profiles , assessing the systematic uncertainties affecting the x - ray mass measurements , and summarize our main findings in section  5 .",
    "unless mentioned otherwise , the quoted errors are statistical uncertainties at @xmath16 confidence level .",
    "in the ` emergent gravity' , dark matter can appear as manifestation of an additional gravitational force describing the `` elastic '' response due to the entropy displacement , and with a strength that can be described in terms of the hubble constant and of the baryonic mass distribution for a spherically symmetric , static and isolated astronomical system as ( equation  7.40 in verlinde 2016 ) : @xmath17 by operating the derivatives with respect to the radius of the two terms , and rearranging the quantities to isolate the dark matter component @xmath18 , it is straightforward to show that the following relation holds : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the baryonic mass equal to the sum of the gas and stellar masses , and @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 , with @xmath23 representing the mean baryon density within the spherical volume @xmath24 . in our case , the gas mass has been obtained from the integral over the cluster s volume of the gas density that is obtained from the geometrical deprojection of the observed surface brightness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obj ] ) including a careful treatment of the background subtraction .",
    "this allows to resolve the signal out to about @xmath25 .",
    "the stellar mass has been estimated using a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw , navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) profile with a concentration of 2.9 ( see e.g. lin et al . 2004 ) and by requiring the @xmath26 ( gonzalez et al .",
    "we compare the predictions from the `` emergent gravity '' with the mass distribution by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation applied to two massive , x - ray luminous galaxy clusters that are part of the x - cop sample .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  cluster outskirts project ( x - cop ; eckert et al .",
    "2016 ) has been built to target the outer regions of a sample of 13 massive clusters ( @xmath27 ) in the redshift range @xmath15 at uniform depth .",
    "the sample was selected based on the signal - to - noise ratio in the planck sz survey ( planck collaboration et al .",
    "2011 ) with the aim of combining high - quality x - ray and sz constraints throughout the entire cluster volume .",
    "our observing strategy allows us to reach a sensitivity of @xmath28 ergs @xmath29 s@xmath6 arcmin@xmath30 in the [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev range thanks to a good control of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the two objects in exam , abell  2142 and abell  2319 , are the first targets of the x - cop sample for which the complete _ xmm - newton _  analysis of their gas properties out to @xmath25 has been completed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : obj ] ) .",
    "abell  2142 ( @xmath31 ) shows a relatively relaxed morphology extended along the se / nw axis , and is undergoing some minor mergers in its outskirts ( owers et al .",
    "2011 ; eckert et al .",
    "this cluster was mapped in the framework of x - cop pilot project ( tchernin et al .",
    "abell  2319 ( @xmath32 , struble & rood 1999 ) is also a massive system in which the galaxy distribution indicates that it is a merger of two main components with a 3:1 mass ratio , the smaller system being located @xmath33 north of the main structure ( oegerle et al .",
    "the cluster exhibits a prominent cold front se of the main core ( ghizzardi et al .",
    "2010 ) and a giant radio halo ( farnsworth et al . 2013 ; storm et al .",
    "this is one of the most significant sz detections in the planck catalogue ( planck collaboration et al .",
    "2014 ) and its complete x - ray analysis , combined with the sz pressure profile , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( ghirardini et al . in prep . ) .    under a reasonable approximation",
    ", these clusters are following verlinde s prescriptions for the validity of the eg modelling : they are reasonably spherical , quite isolated ( being not embedded in the potential well of any neighbour objects and with no major mass accretion ) , and with the largest baryonic component , the hot plasma mapped in x - ray and sz bands , in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the physical quantities directly observable are the density and temperature of the x - ray emitting gas , and the sz pressure profile .",
    "the gas density is obtained from the geometrical deprojection of the x - ray surface brightness in fig .",
    "[ fig : obj ] .",
    "thanks to the observational strategy implemented in x - cop , we are able to correct the x - ray emission for the presence of clumps both by masking substructures spatially resolved with _",
    "xmm - newton _  and by measuring the azimuthal median , instead of the azimuthal mean , out to @xmath34 , with a median relative uncertainty of 6% and 1% in a2142 and a2319 , respectively .",
    "the estimates of the gas temperature are based on the modelling with an absorbed thermal component of the _ xmm - newton _  spectra extracted from concentric annuli around the x - ray peak in the [ 0.512 ] kev energy band and corrected from the local sky background components ( see tchernin et al .",
    "2016 for details ) .",
    "a typical statistical error lower than 5% is associated to these spectral measurements , with a profile resolved in 12 bins out to 1.4 mpc in a2142 and in 14 bins out to 1.9 mpc in a2319 .",
    "the sz electron pressure profile is obtained from the deprojection of the azimuthally - averaged integrated comptonization parameter @xmath35 extracted from a re - analysis of the sz signal mapped with planck ( e.g. tchernin et al .",
    "2016 , planck collaboration et al . 2013 ) and that extends up to @xmath36 3 and 4 mpc in a2142 and a2319 , respectively .",
    "the electron density , temperature and sz pressure profiles are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tn ] .    under the assumption that the intracluster medium has a spherically - symmetric distribution and follows the perfect gas law ( @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath39 is the sum of the electron and proton densities @xmath40 ) , the gas density , combined with the x - ray spectral measurements of the gas temperature and/or the sz derived gas pressure , allows to evaluate the total mass within a radius @xmath41 through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( see e.g. ettori et al .",
    "2013 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gravitational constant , @xmath44 g is the atomic mass unit , and @xmath45 is the mean molecular weight in a.m.u . in this analysis ,",
    "we have applied both the _ backward _ and the _ forward _ method . in",
    "the _ backward _ method , a parametric mass model is assumed and combined with the gas density profile to predict a gas temperature profile that is then compared , through e.g. a @xmath46 minimization , with the one either measured in the spectral analysis or estimated as sz @xmath47 ( losing the spatial resolution in the inner regions because of the modest 7 arcmin fwhm angular resolution of our planck sz maps , but gaining in radial extension due to the planck spatial coverage ; planck collaboration et al .",
    "2013 ) to constrain the mass model parameters . here , we combine both sets of constraints by summing up @xmath48 , that is obtained from the spectral temperatures , and @xmath49 , estimated from the sz pressure profile properly weighted by its covariance matrix . in the present analysis",
    ", we adopt a nfw mass model with two free parameters , the mass concentration and @xmath25 .",
    "this mass model provides a better representation ( i.e. lower @xmath46 ) of our data than any mass model including a central core . the statistical error associated to the mass",
    "is evaluated at each radius considering the range of the mass values allowed from the distribution of the best - fitted parameters within a @xmath50 .",
    "the temperature and pressure profiles required from the best - fitting nfw mass model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tn ] . in",
    "the _ forward _ method , some functional forms are fitted to the gas density profile and the deprojected gas temperature ( or pressure ) profile .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( eq .  [ eq : mhe ] ) is then directly applied to evaluate the radial distribution of the mass .",
    "the errors are estimated through a monte - carlo process .",
    "the functional forms used to reproduce the profiles are a double @xmath51model for the gas density ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) , a 6-parameters function for the temperature , @xmath52 ( e.g. vikhlinin et al . 2006 , baldi et al .",
    "2012 ) , or 5-parameters generalized nfw for the pressure , @xmath53 ( e.g. arnaud et al .",
    "from equation  [ eq : mhe ] , using a _ backward _ method with a nfw model , we measure in a2142 a total mass of @xmath54 , with a relative statistical error of 3 per cent , and @xmath55 kpc , with the gas density that extends up to @xmath56 kpc .",
    "as discussed in tchernin et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , the hydrostatic mass profile agrees well with the one obtained by weak lensing and caustics measurements out to @xmath25 . in a2319 , we measure @xmath57 , with a relative statistical error of 2 per cent , and @xmath58 kpc , with the outermost radius for the gas density at 3 mpc . a systematic uncertainty of about 10 per cent on these mass measurements is estimated by applying the _ forward _ method ( with both the temperature and pressure profiles ) .",
    "the dark matter distribution is then @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the baryonic mass estimated as described in section  2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] , we show the mass profiles obtained both in a context of a @xmath3 model and following the prescriptions for an emergent dark matter contribution . an encouraging match between the two mass profiles is obtained at @xmath61 , where we measure @xmath62 in a2142 and @xmath63 in a2319 , where the errors include only the propagation of the statistical uncertainties . on the contrary , @xmath64 underpredicts significantly , by up to a factor of @xmath65 , the requested amount of matter to maintain the hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regions , @xmath1 kpc .",
    "we conclude that , although the total masses within @xmath66 are in good agreement , the overall shape of the dm profiles looks quite different , with eg lacking some nfw - type curvature .    by inverting the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , and assuming as boundary condition @xmath67",
    ", we can also estimate the gas temperature profiles that the computed @xmath64 would imply for the measured gas density profiles . the tension below 1000 kpc can then be translated in a difference in the gas temperature of 24 kev , that can be hardly accommodated with the present observational constraints .",
    "we have investigated the dark matter profiles in two massive x - ray luminous galaxy clusters for which the gas density and temperature ( from x - ray data ) and sz pressure profiles are recovered at very high accuracy up to about @xmath25 . by applying the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , we constrain the dark matter distribution using different methods and models , obtaining results consistent within @xmath68 per cent .",
    "then , we compare those to @xmath64 , the value predicted to play the role of an apparent dark matter as manifestation of an excess of gravity in the `` emergent gravity '' scenario suggested in verlinde ( 2016 ) , that has the appealing property to depend only on the observed baryonic mass and the hubble constant , with no extra free parameter . to this aim",
    ", we recover the baryonic mass as the sum of the observed gas mass and of the statistically estimated mass in stars .",
    "we observe that @xmath64 reproduces well the dark matter distribution requested to maintain the gas in pressure equilibrium beyond 1 mpc from the cluster core , with a remarkable good match at @xmath61 , and larger discrepancies ( by a factor @xmath65 ) in the innermost 200 kpc .",
    "we note that any hydrostatic bias ( e.g. mahdavi et al .",
    "2013 , donahue et al . 2014 ; bias that we exclude in e.g. a2142 as discussed in tchernin et al .",
    "2016 ) would rise the mass estimates at large radii , improving the agreement at @xmath69 . considering the extremely tight constraints on the gas density that come from the exquisite combination of high statistics and control of the systematics in the background modelling , the only way to reconcile this discrepancy would require a systematic over - estimate of the gas temperature by 24 kev at @xmath70 kpc , that is completely inconsistent with the present observational constraints , also accounting for potential systematics due to the calibration of the x - ray instruments ( e.g. schellenberger et al .",
    "otherwise , this discrepancy might suggest that the verlinde s formula is still missing some temperature ( or gas entropy ) contribution , which effect would be comparable with a modulation by some scale radius .    a larger sample of high quality data , as the ones that will be available in the x - cop project in the next future , will improve the statistical constraints on the goodness of any alternative scenario , as the `` emergent gravity '' here discussed , to the dark matter .",
