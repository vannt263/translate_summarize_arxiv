    "blogs have become an important medium of communication and information on the world wide web . due to their accessible and timely nature",
    ", they are also an intuitive source for data involving the spread of information and ideas . by examining linking propagation patterns from one blog post to another",
    ", we can infer answers to some important questions about the way information spreads through a social network over the web .",
    "for instance , does traffic in the network exhibit bursty , and/or periodic behavior ?",
    "after a topic becomes popular , how does interest die off ",
    "linearly , or exponentially ?",
    "in addition to temporal aspects , we would also like to discover topological patterns in information propagation graphs ( cascades ) .",
    "we explore questions like : do graphs of information cascades have common shapes ?",
    "what are their properties ? what are characteristic in - link patterns for different nodes in a cascade ?",
    "what can we say about the size distribution of cascades ?    finally ,",
    "how can we build models that generate realistic cascades ?",
    "_ temporal patterns : _ for the two months of observation , we found that blog posts do _ not _ have a bursty behavior ; they only have a weekly periodicity .",
    "most surprisingly , the popularity of posts drops with a _ power law _ , instead of exponentially , that one may have expected .",
    "surprisingly , the exponent of the power law is @xmath2 - 1.5 , agreeing very well with barabasi s theory of heavy tails in human behavior  @xcite .",
    "_ patterns in the shapes and sizes of cascades and blogs : _ almost every metric we measured , followed a power law .",
    "the most striking result is that the size distribution of cascades (= number of involved posts ) , follows a perfect zipfian distribution , that is , a power law with slope = -2 .",
    "the other striking discovery was on the shape of cascades .",
    "the most popular shapes were the `` stars '' , that is , a single post with several in - links , but none of the citing posts are themselves cited .",
    "_ generating model : _ finally , we design a flu - like epidemiological model . despite its simplicity",
    ", it generates cascades that match several of the above power - law properties of real cascades .",
    "this model could be useful for link prediction , link - spam detection , and `` what - if '' scenarios .",
    "in section  [ sec : related ] we briefly survey related work .",
    "we introduce basic concepts and terminology in section  [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "next , we describe the blog dataset , and discuss the data cleaning steps .",
    "we describe temporal link patterns in section  [ sec : observ ] , and continue with exploring the characteristics of the information cascades .",
    "we develop and evaluate the cascade generation model  in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "we discuss implications of our findings in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to our knowledge this work presents the first analysis of temporal aspects of blog link patterns , and gives detailed analysis about cascades and information propagation on the blogosphere .",
    "as we explore the methods for modeling such patterns , we will refer to concepts involving power laws and burstiness , social networks in the blog domain , and information cascades .",
    "how often do people create blog posts and links ?",
    "extensive work has been published on patterns relating to human behavior , which often generates bursty traffic .",
    "disk accesses , network traffic , web - server traffic all exhibit burstiness .",
    "wang et al in  @xcite provide fast algorithms for modeling such burstiness .",
    "burstiness is often related to self - similarity , which was studied in the context of world wide web traffic  @xcite .",
    "vazquez et al @xcite demonstrate the bursty behavior in web page visits and corresponding response times .",
    "self - similarity is often a result of heavy - tailed dynamics .",
    "human interactions may be modeled with networks , and attributes of these networks often follow _ power law _",
    "distributions  @xcite .",
    "such distributions have a pdf ( probability density function ) of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the probability to encounter value @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the exponent of the power law . in log - log scales ,",
    "such a pdf gives a straight line with slope @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath7 , we can show that the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) is also a power law with slope @xmath8 , and so is the rank - frequency plot pioneered by zipf  @xcite , with slope @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 we have the standard zipf distribution , and for other values of @xmath6 we have the generalized zipf distribution .",
    "human activity also follows periodicities , like daily , weekly and yearly periodicities , often in combination with the burstiness .",
    "most work on modeling link behavior in large - scale on - line data has been done in the blog domain  @xcite .",
    "the authors note that , while information propagates between blogs , examples of genuine cascading behavior appeared relatively rare . this may , however , be due in part to the web - crawling and text analysis techniques used to infer relationships among posts  @xcite .",
    "our work here differs in a way that we concentrate solely on the propagation of links , and do not infer additional links from text of the post , which gives us more accurate information .",
    "there are several potential models to capture the structure of the blogosphere .",
    "work on information diffusion based on topics  @xcite showed that for some topics , their popularity remains constant in time ( `` chatter '' ) while for other topics the popularity is more volatile ( `` spikes '' ) .",
    "authors in  @xcite analyze community - level behavior as inferred from blog - rolls ",
    "permanent links between `` friend '' blogs .",
    "analysis based on thresholding as well as alternative probabilistic models of node activation is considered in the context of finding the most influential nodes in a network  @xcite , and for viral marketing  @xcite .",
    "such analytical work posits a known network , and uses the model to find the most influential nodes ; in the current work we observe real cascades , characterize them , and build generative models for them .",
    "information cascades are phenomena in which an action or idea becomes widely adopted due to the influence of others , typically , neighbors in some network  @xcite .",
    "cascades on random graphs using a threshold model have been theoretically analyzed  @xcite .",
    "empirical analysis of the topological patterns of cascades in the context of a large product recommendation network is in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the study of epidemics offers powerful models for analyzing the spread of viruses .",
    "our topic propagation model is based on the _ sis _",
    "( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) model of epidemics  @xcite .",
    "this is models flu - like viruses , where an entity begin as `` susceptible '' , may become `` infected '' and infectious , and then heals to become susceptible again . a key parameter is the infection probability @xmath11 , that is , the probability of a disease transmission in a single contact . of high interest is the _ epidemic threshold _ , that is , the critical value of @xmath11 , above which the virus will spread and create an epidemic , as opposed to becoming extinct . there is a huge literature on the study of epidemics on full cliques , homogeneous graphs , infinite graphs ( see  @xcite for a survey ) , with recent studies on power - law networks  @xcite and arbitrary networks  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we also experimented with other , more sophisticated versions of the model .",
    "namely , we investigated various strategies of selecting a starting point of the cascade , and using edge weights ( number of blog - to - blog links ) to further boost cascades .",
    "we considered selecting a cascade starting blog based on the blog in - degree , in - weight or the number of posts .",
    "we experimented variants where the probability @xmath12 of propagating via a link is not constant but also depends on the weight of the link ( number of references between the blogs ) .",
    "we also considered versions of the model where the probability @xmath12 exponentially decays as the cascade spreads away from the origin .",
    "we found out that choosing a cascade starting blog in a biased way results in too large cascades and non - heavy tailed distributions of cascade sizes .",
    "intuitively , this can be explained by the fact that popular blogs are in the core of the blog network , and it is very easy to create large cascades when starting in the core .",
    "a similar problem arises when scaling @xmath12 with the edge weight .",
    "this can also be explained by the fact that we are not considering specific topics and associate each edge with a topic ( some blog - to - blog edges may be very topic - specific ) and thus we allow the cascade to spread over all edges regardless of the particular reason ( the topic ) that the edge between the blogs exists .",
    "this is especially true for blogs like boingboing that are very general and just a collection of `` wonderful things '' .",
    "our finding that the the popularity of posts drops off with a power law distribution is interesting since intuition might lead one to believe that people would `` forget '' a post topic in an exponential pattern .",
    "however , since linking patterns are based on the behaviors of individuals over several instances , much like other real - world patterns that follow power laws such as traffic to web pages and scientists response times to letters  @xcite , it is reasonable to believe that a high number of individuals link posts quickly , and later linkers fall off with a heavy - tailed pattern .    our findings have potential applications in many areas .",
    "one could argue that the conversation mass metric , defined as the total number of posts in all conversation trees below the point in which the blogger contributed , summed over all conversation trees in which the blogger appears , is a better proxy for measuring influence .",
    "this metric captures the mass of the total conversation generated by a blogger , while number of in - links captures only direct responses to the blogger s posts .",
    "for example , we found that boingboing , which a very popular blog about amusing things , is engaged in many cascades .",
    "actually , 85% of all boingboing posts were cascade initiators .",
    "the cascades generally did not spread very far but were wide ( e.g. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in fig .  [",
    "fig : shapes ] ) . on the other hand @xmath15 of posts from a political blog michellemalkin",
    "were cascade initiators .",
    "but the cascade here were deeper and generally larger ( e.g. , @xmath16 in fig .  [",
    "fig : shapes ] ) than those of boingboing .",
    "we analyzed one of the largest available collections of blog information , trying to find how blogs behave and how information propagates through the blogosphere .",
    "we studied two structures , the `` blog network '' and the `` post network '' .",
    "our contributions are two - fold : ( a ) the discovery of a wealth of temporal and topological patterns and ( b ) the development of a generative model that mimics the behavior of real cascades . in more detail ,",
    "our findings are summarized as follows :    * _ temporal patterns : _ the decline of a post s popularity follows a power law .",
    "the slope is @xmath2 - 1.5 , the slope predicted by a very recent theory of heavy tails in human behavior  @xcite * _ topological patterns : _ almost any metric we examined follows a power law : size of cascades , size of blogs , in- and out - degrees . to our surprise",
    ", the number of in- and out - links of a blog are not correlated",
    ". finally , stars and chains are basic components of cascades , with stars being more common . * _ generative model : _ our idea is to reverse - engineer the underlying social network of blog - owners , and to treat the influence propagation between blog - posts as a flu - like virus , that is , the sis model in epidemiology . despite its simplicity ,",
    "our model generates cascades that match very well the real cascades with respect to in - degree distribution , cascade size distribution , and popular cascade shapes .",
    "future research could try to include the content of the posts , to help us find even more accurate patterns of influence propagation .",
    "another direction is to spot anomalies and link - spam attempts , by noticing deviations from our patterns .",
