    "methone , anthe , pallene are three tiny moons located at the inner edge of saturn s e ring , located between the massive moons mimas ( @xmath5 , @xmath6=60,268 km is saturn radius ) and enceladus ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "observations by the cassini imaging science subsystem ( iss ) showed that dusty ring - arcs envelop the moons methone and anthe , and a torus exists in the vicinity of pallene s orbit @xcite .",
    "although the mean radii of these moons are less than 3@xmath8 @xcite , they are the most likely sources of these arcs through the impact - ejecta process , which produces dust ejecta caused by impacts of interplanetary micrometeoroids on these moons @xcite . due to the small size of the moons ,",
    "the escape speed is small so that nearly all the ejecta can escape from the moon .",
    "methone occupies both the radial regions of mimas 15:14 corotation eccentricity resonance ( cer ) and mimas 15:14 outer lindblad resonance , while anthe is librating inside mimas 11:10 cer @xcite .",
    "these resonances can trap dust particles released from the surface of these moons , leading to dust arcs in their vicinity . theoretically , the maximal librating longitude is @xmath9 for the methone arc , and @xmath10 for the anthe arc .",
    "the observed length of the methone arc is about 10@xmath11 , while it is about 20@xmath11 for anthe , which means that both arcs must be confined by the nearby resonances @xcite .",
    "an analog to the anthe and methone arcs can be found in the saturn s g ring arc , which also confined by a resonance with mimas and also contain a tiny moon @xcite .",
    "although lack of observation , if these arcs are similar to other faint rings like the saturn g ring and is maintained by impact - ejecta process , then the arcs should contain significant amount of micron - sized particles .",
    "the small grain size implies that several perturbing forces are dominating the shape of these arcs simultaneously .",
    "for example , the interaction of solar radiation pressure , oblateness of saturn , and lorentz force can result in a heliotropic shape of the ring ( an elliptic ring with pericenter or apocenter in sun direction ) as observed in the e ring and the charming ringlet in the cassini division @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to the arc structure we see always just a part of the heliotropic ring .",
    "further , plasma drag pushes e ring micron - sized particles outwards at a rate of order 1@xmath6 per saturn year @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the impact - eject process , the dynamics , and the sinks of particles in section 2 for modeling , and the simulation results are presented in section 3 . especially we will discuss the heliotropic behavior and the interaction between drag force and resonances in the arc .",
    "discussions and conclusion are given in section 4 .",
    "to understand the spatial distribution and amount of dust near methone and anthe , we have to model the sources , dynamics , and sinks .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , we assume dust to be produced through the impact - ejecta process @xcite , which is generated by the hypervelocity impacts of interplanetary dust on the surfaces of methone and anthe .",
    "the dynamics includes several perturbing forces that are summarized in eq .  .",
    "finally , dust sinks include collisions with moons , paricle erosion due to sputtering , and orbital evolution via plasma drag .",
    "a single hypervelocity impact of a interplanetary dust particle ( idp ) on the surface of an atmosphereless body can create a huge amount of ejecta .",
    "the mass production rate is given by @xmath12 the product of the idp mass flux @xmath13 , the yield @xmath14 is the ratio of ejected mass to the projectile mass , and the cross section of target moon @xmath15 .",
    "both methone and anthe are so small that the initial ejecta speeds usually exceed the escape speeds of the moons ( as shown in table .",
    "[ tab : n_plus ] ) , so almost all ejecta escape methone and anthe .",
    "the idp mass flux @xmath13 at the saturn environment is not yet well determined by observations , we adapt the value from @xcite , who used the @xcite model .",
    "this value may be overestimated by an order of magnitude and thus needs a further update .",
    "the yield @xmath14 is also quite uncertain , it s value depends sensitively on surface properties , which are poorly known .",
    "details of the impact - ejecta model are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the important parameters used here are listed in table  [ tab : impeje ] .",
    "the resulting source rates @xmath16 are summarize in table .",
    "[ tab : n_plus ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the difference in their dynamics , large and small particles have quite different fates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tab : size_fate ] .",
    "roughly speaking , larger particles from methone are more likely to collide with the source moon because in average they are confined in the arcs close to the source for longer time . in the case of anthe , probably due to the small cross section of anthe , only a few large particles ( out of 2000 ) collide with anthe . apart from that ,",
    "for both methone and anthe , there are about 10 - 20% of particles going to collide with enceladus .",
    "the rest @xmath1780% of particles they leave the area of interest ( 3 - 4@xmath18 ) , due to outward migration of large eccentricity .",
    "in the limited amount of observations by cassini iss , anthe is found in the back ( relative to orbital direction ) and middle of the arc , this can be explained by the moon and arc material librate around a stable co - rotation point of the mimas resonance at different phases @xcite .",
    "our simulation results show additionally that the averaged relative longitudes of arc materials are behind anthe s and methone s mean position by several degrees , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : a_corot ] .",
    "this asymmetry can be explained by plasma drag as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] : while particles are librating around the certain stable co - rotation points of mimas resonances , plasma drag prevent them to reach the furthermost region in the leading longitudes because they are pushed outward before they arrive at the region . pushed outward means smaller kepler velocity and therefore start to move backward relative to the center prematurely . to verify this , we run a simulation of methone arc without plasma drag .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot_sym ] shows a symmetric distribution of particle longitudes . while the longitudinal profiles of simulated methone arc with and without plasma drag ( fig .  [ fig : m_corot ] and fig .  [ fig : m_corot_sym ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot_sym_1d ] . note that such phenomenon has not been found in observations of methone and anthe arcs .",
    "the same idea of the combination of drag force and resonance has been used to explain the longitudinal asymmetry of encke ringlet of saturn ( @xcite ; sun 2015 , in preparation ) .     and",
    "[ fig : a_corot ] . arc material are librating around center of libration . without drag , particles librate inside the solid curve which correspond to the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot_sym ] ; with drag , particles librate inside the asymmetric dashed ellipse . ]     but plasma drag is not in the simulation and use only 160 test particles . ]",
    "( drag ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot_sym ] ( no drag ) .",
    "the maximal optical depth has been scaled to same level .",
    "the optical depths here are slightly smaller because the @xmath2 is averaged over a wider area ( radial distance @xmath19 ) .",
    "the x - axis has been inverted so that the orbital direction is toward left , same as fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot_sym ] ]    for the assumed values in the impact - ejecta model , we predict that the geometric optical depth should be in the order of @xmath20 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_corot ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : a_corot ] .",
    "however , as pointed out earlier , the impactor flux @xmath13 we use could be orders of magnitude overestimated , and there are also uncertainties on the yields @xmath14 .",
    "this means the amount of dust in the arc can be at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the predicted optical depth is much smaller than the total optical depth of the e ring at this region , but the e ring is dominated by 1@xmath1 particles while larger particles dominate the optical depth of the arcs .",
    "thus , this could explain the observability of the arcs in low phase images @xcite .    on the other hand , we ignored a potential source of dust . based on the absorption of electrons observed by cassini low energy magnetospheric measurement system ( lemms ) ,",
    "@xcite proposed an arc composed of particles larger than a millimeter near methone , and the optical depth is below the detection limit .",
    "these ` large ' particles could also be the source of smaller ones via impact - ejecta process .",
    "assuming the optical depth of these larger particles is @xmath21 , and assume the 24@xmath11 methone arc center at radial distance of methone ( @xmath22 ) and the width is 1000@xmath8 , then the total cross section of large particles is about 8.1@xmath23 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the cross section of methone ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "since the dust production rate is proportional to the cross section ( eq .  ) as long as all ejecta can escape their source , this implies the source rate can be doubled .",
    "additionally , particles larger than 30@xmath1 could also contribute to the optical depths due to their longer lifetimes which has not been considered in the calculations .",
    "we use numerical simulations to estimate geometric optical depth of methone s and anthe s arcs . to do this ,",
    "we model the source , the dynamical evolution , and the sinks of particles .",
    "we use the impact - ejecta model @xcite to estimate the source rate of particles , though the parameters , especially @xmath13 and @xmath14 should need further updates . for the dynamical evolution",
    ", we consider the perturbing forces : oblateness of saturn , solar radiation pressure , lorentz force , and plasma drag .",
    "mimas and enceladus are both considered : mimas play an important role in confining the arc material , while enceladus is the next massive moon outside these two arcs . the dominating mechanism to remove particles from the arc",
    "is plasma drag which pushes them outwards .",
    "about 10 - 20% of all particles end on enceladus . if only consider the larger particles ( @xmath25 ) , recollision with the source moons is as important as migrating outward .",
    "the erosion of particles by plasma sputtering is also taken into account , which not only limits the maximum lifetime of particles , but also implies the dynamics change with time because of the decreasing grain radii .",
