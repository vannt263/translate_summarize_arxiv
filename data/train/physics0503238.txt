    "physicists investigate biological and sociological systems , applying their tools , borrowed mainly from statistical physics . in the last years",
    ", the evolution of languages and competition among them gained much interest of non - linguistics , especially researchers working in evolutionary systems similar to biological ones .",
    "there have been several approaches to reveal the similarities between the evolution of biological systems and languages at the end of the nineteenth century  @xcite .",
    "numerical models simulating the competition of many languages have given new insights into the behavior of agents , for instance on a lattice  @xcite , as well as into the size distribution of languages  @xcite .",
    "a review of them can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our model is based on the well understood penna ageing model  @xcite on a lattice  @xcite which provides us a possibility to model a sexually reproducing stable population .",
    "we simplify the model by defining languages as an integer number , that is they are not composed of different words .",
    "thus we are able to avoid changes in the same language .",
    "the parents pass their language entirely to their offspring . in order to stabilize their distribution ,",
    "languages can be forgotten during lifetime .",
    "the study of an interface between originally different regions under different parameter sets reveals certain characteristics of the geographical distribution of the languages on the lattice as well as of the age structure of the agents for different languages .",
    "this articles is organized as follows : the next section explains the main features of the model and tries to justify the parameters we use .",
    "we present the results and the conclusions in the two following sections .",
    "this section is separated into two subsections in order to provide the reader a small review of the penna model on a lattice as well as to present our modifications adapting the model to a system where languages compete with each other .",
    "each individual or agent comprises two bit - strings ( diploid ) of 32 bits that are read in parallel . after birth , at every time step a new position of both bit - strings is read .",
    "a bit equal to 1 corresponds to a harmful allele .",
    "all individuals have five predefined dominant positions where one harmful allele suffices to represent an inherited disease starting to diminish health from that age on which corresponds to the bit position . at the other positions two set bits are needed to switch on the effect of a disease .",
    "as soon as the agent reaches an age at which the current number of deleterious mutations exceeds the threshold value @xmath0 , the agent dies . in order to have a stable population , every time step an individual dies with the additional probability : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the actual population size and @xmath3 the so called carrying capacity representing a maximum population size . after reaching the minimum reproduction age @xmath4 ,",
    "a female agent searches every time step for a male , of age equal or greater than the minimum reproduction age , among the central site and its four nearest neighbors to generate two offspring .",
    "it selects a male on the central site with a probability of 25% , and if it fails , it searches among the nearest neighbor sites , at each one with a probability of 25% .",
    "the two bit - strings of the offspring are built by a random crossing and recombination of the parents bit - strings ( see ref .",
    "each new bit - string suffers a deleterious mutation ( from zero to one ) at a random position .",
    "if the selected bit is already 1 , it remains 1 in the offspring bit - string .",
    "the offspring is placed on a nearest neighbor site of the mother even if the site is already occupied ( which is different from the usual versions of the penna model on a lattice ) .",
    "every time step an agent moves to a randomly selected nearest neighbor site with probability @xmath5 , if this site is less or equally populated .",
    "the bit - strings are initialized randomly with zeros and ones at the first time step .    for a more detailed description of the penna model and its implementation on a square lattice",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .      for simplicity",
    "we define a language by an integer number and not by a bit - string which would describe , for instance , different words or an alphabet as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "every agent speaks a language @xmath6 , an individual variable which can have three values : @xmath7 and @xmath8 mean that it speaks language 1 or 2 , respectively .",
    "the third possibility , @xmath9 , describes the case where an agent speaks both languages .",
    "our model contains two parameters dealing directly with these language values . at birth",
    "an offspring learns the language @xmath6 of its parents if they speak the same one(s ) . in the case of parents with different values of @xmath6",
    "the offspring speaks both languages ( @xmath9 ) with probability @xmath10 , otherwise it speaks only one language , each with the same probability .",
    "the other parameter is the probability @xmath11 , for which an agent may forget an already learned language .",
    "every time step an agent , which speaks _ both _ languages , counts the number of surrounding agents speaking language @xmath6 in its neighborhood . this neighborhood is defined by a square of a distance of @xmath12 sites from the central site , for instance the 8 nearest neighbors with @xmath13 or 24 with @xmath14",
    ". the central site is not counted . if and only if there is a majority of people in the neighborhood speaking language 1 or 2 the agent forgets language 2 or 1 with probability @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "thus it speaks only the language which dominates in its surrounding .",
    "the lattice has free boundary conditions .",
    "in our simulations we restrict ourselves to the following initial conditions : half of the lattice of size @xmath15 is filled up with agents speaking language @xmath7 and the other half with language @xmath8 .",
    "we study stability and shape of the interface between these two regions .",
    "simulations with randomly distributed languages do not present a stable interface : the whole population speaks only one and the same language after a few time steps .",
    "the initial population consists of @xmath16 males and @xmath16 females randomly distributed over the lattice with the values of @xmath6 as described above .",
    "the carrying capacity is @xmath17 on a @xmath18 square lattice .",
    "the simulations show that the interface is neither stable for @xmath10 values smaller than one nor for low occupation ( less than 100 agents per site ) , which is controlled by the carrying capacity @xmath19 and the lattice size . after a short time",
    "the number of agents speaking @xmath6 begins to fluctuate strongly and finally converges into the stable state where only one language is spoken .",
    "in general the stability of the interface depends crucially on the initial state as well as on the random seed .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig : inst ] shows a simulation with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath13 presenting such an instability .",
    "remain.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    , [ fig : inst ]    we concentrate now on the results of the simulations for different values of the parameter @xmath11 , leading an agent to forget one of its languages .",
    "we fix the other parameters to @xmath21 , @xmath13 and @xmath22 . as a function of age ,",
    "figure  [ fig : a_struct ] shows the population of bilinguals ( agents speaking both languages ) divided by the monolinguals ( @xmath7 or @xmath23 ) for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the function decreases exponentially due to the effect that every time step a fraction of the bilinguals becomes monolingual . with increasing @xmath11",
    "a larger fraction of older bilingual agents forgets one of their two languages since in their environment they do not need both .",
    "the higher is the probability to forget a language , the smaller is the number of older agents speaking both languages and thus less offspring with @xmath9 are created .",
    "figure  [ fig : freqpf ] depicts the mean value of monolinguals and bilinguals during one simulation for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "the number of bilinguals decreases with increasing @xmath11 as expected .",
    "it seems that the fraction of bilinguals decays roughly as power law with exponent @xmath24 for higher values of @xmath11 .",
    "divided by the number of agents with @xmath7 , as a function of ages .",
    "the number of agents speaking both languages decreases drastically with age for large values of @xmath11.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]        figure  [ fig : distr_pf ] shows the number of agents with certain value of @xmath6 versus their position in direction @xmath25 perpendicular to the interface . the number is averaged over the direction parallel to the interface and is measured after @xmath16 time steps .",
    "we observe a quite stable interface between the two regions , each one with one of the two languages in majority .",
    "the number of agents speaking @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays exponentially at the interface as also reported in ref .",
    "interestingly , the number of bilinguals is constant over the whole lattice .",
    "the shape is not altered by changing @xmath11 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath7 and the solid line to @xmath8 . for all values of @xmath11",
    "we find an exponential behavior at the interface.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we increased the number of agents by setting @xmath26 and the initial populations to @xmath27 females and @xmath27 males for @xmath28 : now the exponential decay at the interface is observed clearly , as seen in figure  [ fig : distrb ] .    in our simulations",
    "we have also changed the parameter @xmath12 , defining the number of neighbors an agent with @xmath9 examines , in order to know which language it can forget .",
    "the results for large @xmath12 are the same as for @xmath13 .     on the interface .",
    "bilinguals are homogeneously distributed .",
    "the number of monolinguals decays exponentially at the interface.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the distribution of speakers on the lattice for different movement rates @xmath5 is shown in figure  [ fig : distrm ] .",
    "we set @xmath29 and @xmath13 .",
    "higher movement rates lead to a smoother interface .",
    "thus the exponential decay is weaker for large @xmath5 . at very high movement rates",
    "the interface becomes unstable .",
    "with @xmath13 and @xmath29 .",
    "the larger @xmath5 is , the smoother becomes the steepness of the exponential decay.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we present simulations where the population of speakers of two different languages are of similar size for at least @xmath16 time steps .",
    "this meta - stable state is obtained only for a large number of agents per site and initialization of the lattice by distributing the speakers of different languages on different halfs of the lattice .",
    "we can interpret that an interface of speakers in high populated areas , for instance at the canal street of new orleans where on one side french and on the other side english is spoken , is more stable than in low populated areas .",
    "different languages can not survive for long times if their speakers are not geographically separated .",
    "another result of the model is that the fraction of bilinguals relative to monolinguals decreases exponentially with age .",
    "older people , living for long time at the same place , do not need a second language .",
    "the mean value of the number of bilinguals versus the parameter @xmath11 to forget a second language shows a power law with exponent @xmath24 .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are well reproduced in our model : at the interface the number of monolinguals decreases exponentially .",
    "surprisingly , the number of bilinguals distributes rather homogeneously over the whole grid .",
    "the exponential decay of the number of monolinguals becomes steeper for smaller movement rates but is left unaltered by the lattice size .",
    "higher movement rates lead to a more homogeneous distribution and can break the meta - stability of the interface . nowadays",
    ", globalization gives us the possibility to travel frequently over long distances and to stay larger periods at different places on earth , one of the reasons why languages are becoming extinct .",
    "we presented here the first model for language competition including ageing and sexual reproduction and reproduced well the results of other models although they are quite different .",
    "numerical agent - based models on the computer yield interesting results despite their simplicity , and we think that there will be much more to be done in future .",
