    "does not provide a direct access to the recorded data , the holographic film has been replaced by 2d electronic detector in digital holography @xcite , whose main advantage is to perform the data acquisition and the holographic reconstruction numerically @xcite .",
    "off - axis holography @xcite is the oldest and the simplest configuration adapted to digital holography @xcite . in off - axis digital holography , as well as in photographic plate holography , the reference or local oscillator ( lo ) beam is angularly tilted with respect to the object observation axis .",
    "it is then possible to record , with a single hologram , the two quadratures of the object s complex field .",
    "however , the object field of view is reduced , since one must avoid the overlapping of the image with the conjugate image alias .",
    "phase - shifting digital holography , which has been later introduced @xcite , records several images with a different phase for the lo beam .",
    "it is then possible to obtain the two quadratures of the field in an in - line configuration even though the conjugate image alias and the true image overlap , because aliases can be removed by taking image differences .    with the development of ccd camera techniques ,",
    "digital holography became a fast - growing research field that has drawn increasing attention @xcite .",
    "off - axis holography has been applied recently to particle @xcite , polarization @xcite , phase contrast @xcite , synthetic aperture @xcite , low - coherence @xcite and microscopic @xcite imaging .",
    "phase - shifting holography has been applied to 3d @xcite , color @xcite , synthetic aperture @xcite , low - coherence @xcite , surface shape @xcite and microscopic @xcite imaging .",
    "we have developed an alternative phase - shifting digital holography technique that uses a frequency shift of the reference beam to continuously shift the phase of the recorded interference pattern @xcite .",
    "more generally , our setup can be viewed as a multipixel heterodyne detector that is able of recording the complex field @xmath0 scattered by an object in all pixels of the ccd camera in parallel .",
    "because the holographic signal results in the interference of the object signal complex field @xmath0 with a reference ( lo ) complex field @xmath1 , whose amplitude can be much larger ( i.e. @xmath2 ) , the holographic detection benefits of  heterodyne gain ",

    "this double filtering combined with heterodyne gain open the way to holography of weak object fields @xmath0 with ultimate sensitivity @xcite .",
    "this type of holography has been used ( i ) to detect and analyse the laser doppler spectrum of the extremely weak optical signal that is transmitted and scattered by a human breast in vivo ( @xmath4 photoelectron per pixel ) @xcite , ( ii ) to image , localize and analyse the motion of metallic nano particules @xcite , and ( iii ) to analyse vibration of very small amplitude @xcite by detecting the holographic signal on the vibration sideband @xcite .    since at low signal the prevalent and the limiting noise is shot noise @xcite , it is important to study how shot noise limits the image quality in digital holography .",

    "we have modified our experimental setup to record holograms with and without illumination of the object ( but with reference beam ) in the same acquisition run .",
    "we have measured the noise background without illumination and compared it with the signal obtained with illumination .",
    "we have studied experimentally , how the signal and the noise scales , on amplitude reconstructed images , with the two mains parameters of the holographic acquisition and reconstruction that are the number of frames , and the number of pixels of the reconstruction spatial filter @xcite .",
    "the first parameter is related to the detection frequency bandwidth in time , the second one to the bandwidth in space .",
    "the expected scale factor values are retrieved : the signal to noise background ratio varies roughly like the inverse of the bandwidth in time and space . finally , we have compared the noise background observed in experiments , with the shot noise background calculated by the verpillat et al .",

    "this parasitic light is thus not detected , and the illumination leaks are reduced .",
    "second , the electronic switch turns on and off the illumination in such a way that the even frames are recorded with illumination of the sample , and the odd frames without ( but the lo beam remains for both even and odd frames ) . in the following `` with illumination '' means thus with illumination and lo beams on , while `` without illumination '' means with illumination beam off and lo beam on .",
    "the frequency shift of the lo is here @xmath31 ( and not @xmath32 ) to record standard 4 phases hologram with and without object illumination : the phase shift between successive even ( or odd ) frames is therefore @xmath33 .    we must notice that the combination of the electronic switch with the 8 phases detection is not needed for making 4 phase phase shifting holography .",

    "figure [ fig_curve_noise_4 ] shows that , the measured average intensities are extremely close to the monte carlo simulated ones for all numbers of frames , and all spatial filter areas .",
    "the noise observed in experiment is thus dominated by shot noise .",
    "it should be noted that thanks to the heterodyne gain , our setup is immune to electronic noises .",
    "similar results are expected with any well - built scientific camera that uses low noise electronic in particular for the amplifying stage before analog to digital conversion .",
    "industrial cameras that may exhibit electronic noise must be avoided .",
    "it should also be noted that the ccd exposure time ( for 1 frame ) does not play any role , since it do not appear in the monte carlo simulation .",

    "thus , the exposure time plays no rule as far as the dark noise of the camera remains lower than the local oscillator signal ( lo ) .",
    "the scaling laws observed for the experimental noise can be interpreted physically .",
    "the shot noise is a white noise , which is random and gaussian in spatial and temporal frequencies .",
    "the holographic detection is coherent in space and time . as a result , on one hand ( space ) , the detected noise is proportional to the number of spatial modes that are detected , i.e. to the number of pixels of the spatial filter . on the other hand ( time ) , the noise is proportional to the product of the measurement time @xmath125 by the detection bandwidth , which is here equal to @xmath126 . as a result ,",
    "the equivalent noise does not depend on time , i.e. on the number of frames @xmath84 .",
    "one must notice that the holographic signal @xmath127 , detected by the camera , is the interference of the optical field scattered by the object @xmath0 with the reference beam local oscillator field @xmath1 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath128 .",
    "this signal is detected and integrated over time by the camera yielding a measurement in photoelectron units ( e ) .",

    "this result is general and does not depends on the number of frames , nor on the spatial filter area .",
    "the equivalent noise corresponds thus 1 photoelectron per pixel of the spatial filter whatever the number of frames or spatial filter area is @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the experimental and monte carlo simulated signals depends on the gain of the camera @xmath138 with different factors .",
    "on one hand , the frame signal @xmath91 , and the measured holograms @xmath69 are expressed in photo electron units .",
    "they are proportional to @xmath138 . on the other hand ,",

    "[ eq_noise o3 ] .",
    "they depend on @xmath138 through @xmath139 .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath96 varies thus like the square root of @xmath138 .",
    "as result , the monte carlo holograms @xmath140 that are calculated from the monte carlo frames @xmath141 ( defined by eq .",
    "[ eq_monte_carlo ] ) , are proportional to @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the agreement of the measured noise with the monte carlo calculated shot noise depends on the exact value of the camera gain @xmath138 .",
    "this gain @xmath101 has been calibrated by the camera manufacturer ( here @xmath143 4.41 e / dc ) by illuminating the camera with a very clean white light source , which must be stable spatially and temporally and by assuming that the observed fluctuations of the camera signal in time or in space result from shot noise @xcite .",
    "the holographic measurement we have done without object illumination is thus very close to what was done to calibrate the camera .",
    "nevertheless , our light source is much less clean .",
    "our laser may exhibit temporal fluctuations , and , because of stray reflections , the power of the lo beam is not constant on the camera detecting area , as shown on image of frame @xmath144 at left in fig.[fig_fig_monte_carlo ] . the good agreement between the measured noise and the noise calculated by monte carlo from the gain @xmath138 of the camera , shows that the fluctuation we got with a laser are the same than the fluctuation observed by the camera manufacturer with a white light source yielding the same average camera signal .",
    "this means that the defects of our experimental setup ( temporal fluctuations of the laser intensity and spatial variations of the lo signal ) do not seem to bring excess of noise with respect to shot noise .",
    "we think we are insensitive to defaults of our setup because we do both heterodyne and off - axis holography .",
    "the holographic signal is thus modulated both in time ( heterodyne ) and space ( off - axis ) .",
    "the unwanted low frequency time components are filtered off by building holograms with many frames ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_holograms_h ] and eq .",
    "[ eq_holograms_h11 ] ) , while the low frequency space components are filtered off by spatial filtering .",
    "by recording hologram of a usaf target under weak illumination with our off axis heterodyne holography setup , we have found that the signal and noise scales as expected with a shot noise limited experiment .",
    "the signal for the reconstructed image intensity @xmath76 is proportional to the square of the time , while the noise , which is equal to the expected shot noise @xcite , is proportional to the time , and to the number of modes involved in the holographic reconstruction ( area of the spatial filter in pixels units ) .",
