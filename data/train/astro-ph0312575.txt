    "pre  main - sequence stellar evolutionary models are fundamental to our paradigm of star formation and early stellar evolution .",
    "these models are the means by which masses and ages are assigned to young stars and brown dwarfs , and are therefore central to our understanding of physical processes that depend , directly or indirectly , on knowledge of stellar masses and ages . indeed , pre  main - sequence ( pms ) stellar evolutionary models touch upon the most basic questions in star formation research : the nature and origin of the initial mass function ; the timescale for circumstellar disk evolution and planet formation ; and the initial distribution of stellar angular momentum , its evolution in time , and the dependence of that evolution on stellar mass , accretion , and other mass - dependent properties .",
    "thus , the absolute calibration of pms evolutionary models with respect to stellar mass is of foundational importance to star formation research .",
    "empirical mass determinations exist in the literature for 15 individual pms stars @xcite , with only 6 of these in the mass domain of 1 m@xmath3 or below .",
    "moreover , many of these measurements , while of high precision , potentially suffer from systematic errors ( primarily distance uncertainties ) that limit their accuracy .",
    "indeed , there is no pms star with @xmath4 whose mass has been measured with an accuracy of better than a few percent .",
    "consequently , the absolute mass calibration of theoretical pms evolutionary tracks remains weakly constrained by observations .",
    "the dearth of accurate measurements below 1 m@xmath3 is particularly salient because low - mass stars dominate studies of young stellar populations , and it is in this mass domain that key , outstanding questions remain with respect to , e.g. , the nature of the initial mass function @xcite and the evolution of stellar angular momentum @xcite .    eclipsing binary stars",
    "provide a uniquely powerful means of determining absolute stellar masses because the mass determinations are distance - independent .",
    "eclipsing binaries also yield direct measurement of the stellar radii , permitting the determination of stellar luminosities that are also distance independent . to date , only four eclipsing binaries with pms components have been reported in the literature @xcite .    here",
    "we report the discovery of a previously unknown , double - lined , spectroscopic , eclipsing binary system in the orion star - forming region , .",
    "we combine time - series photometry with high - resolution spectroscopy to determine all of the fundamental physical properties of the system and of its stellar components .",
    "we then use these measurements to test the predictions of a variety of pms stellar evolutionary models .",
    "we begin by describing the discovery of and its identification as a pms eclipsing binary in  [ discovery ] . in  [ data ] , we present our photometric and spectroscopic observations and the methods used in their reduction .",
    "we analyze these observations in  [ analysis ] to determine the system ephemeris and to derive a precise double - lined orbit solution , providing absolute stellar masses .",
    "we conduct a thorough spectroscopic analysis that includes determination of the stellar rotational velocities , measurement of the primary - to - secondary flux ratio , spectral classification and determination of effective temperatures , measurement of li abundances , and measurement of the equivalent width of h@xmath5 emission .",
    "we also present a full analysis of our multi - band time - series photometry using synthetic light - curve fitting to determine precise , absolute stellar dimensions .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in  [ results ] , including an independent determination of the distance to .    in ",
    "[ tracks ] we use our empirically determined stellar masses , radii , effective temperatures , and luminosities to test a variety of pms stellar evolutionary tracks possessing a variety of characteristics , including different atmosphere models and treatment of convection .",
    "we assess the performance of the theoretical models both against the components of alone as well as against the ensemble of all pms stars with empirical mass determinations in the literature .",
    "we consider how the tracks compare quantitatively to the data in both high- and low - mass regimes , in both binary and single systems , and in both the h - r diagram and mass - radius observational planes .",
    "moreover , we examine the general behavior of the tracks to suggest , in qualitative terms , how their performance against the data might be improved .    in addition , we assay the ensemble of empirical mass determinations independent of the models to explore the degree of internal consistency in the data themselves , and we show how li abundances can be used in some cases to resolve apparent contradictions . finally , we discuss more general insights that can be gleaned from the li abundances , arguing that the data strongly favor models with inefficient convection in the stellar interior during the pms stage of evolution , even though such models can not reproduce the properties of the present - day sun .",
    "we present a summary of our conclusions in  [ summary ] .",

    "the general catalog of variable stars , whose designation we use in this paper , reports a range of 1.1 mag ( in the photographic system ) between its high and low states .",
    "more recently , the rosat observatory included ( designation ros - ori  166 ) in a deep pspc pointing centered on the trapezium region .",
    "the analysis of these data by @xcite assigns a net of 75 x - ray photons to , for a count rate of 17.02 cts / ks .",

    "more recently , @xcite presented @xmath10 light curves of ( star number 4008 in their catalog ) , as part of their analysis of time - series photometry of the orion star - forming region , conducted as an extension of the 2mass project .",
    "their light curves show rms scatters of 0.080.09 mag .",
    "in addition to low - level variability , their light curves display evidence for a possible eclipse event in the form of a single observation ( seen in all three filters ) that is 0.30.4 mag dimmer than the mean brightness level .",

    "was in eclipse during at least 7 of the 30 nights covered by their observations ( assuming the ephemeris we adopt in  [ analysis ] ) , but with only one observation per night their light curves were presumably too sparse to detect periodic behavior ( if they detected the eclipses at all ) .",

    "was also included in several pointings during our spectroscopic survey of the region with the wiyn multi - object spectrograph , which showed to have strong li absorption ( an indicator of stellar youth ) and revealed it to be a single - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "we confirmed the spectroscopic presence of the secondary in a spectrum kindly obtained by g.  basri with the keck hires spectrograph , which also clearly revealed the presence of li absorption due to the secondary ( fig .",
    "[ li - hires - fig ] ) .",
    "this spectrum also allowed us to determine that the primary was of roughly mid - k spectral type .",
    "having identified as a pms eclipsing binary and double - lined spectroscopic binary , we obtained multiple high - s / n , high - resolution spectra with which to determine a precise , double - lined orbit solution .",
    "we also obtained high - precision , high - cadence light curves at multiple wavelengths in order to ( a ) firmly establish the system ephemeris , and to ( b ) determine , via light - curve synthesis and modeling , such parameters as the orbital inclination , component radii , and ratio of component effective temperatures .",
    "the one remaining piece of information needed to fully establish all system parameters is the effective temperature of one of the components , a datum also provided by our high - resolution spectroscopy .    here",

    "[ xcorl - fig]a ) .",
    "for each spectrum we thus in principle have 32 separate ( but not independent ) radial - velocity determinations for each of the primary and secondary . in practice",
    ", however , some orders consistently produce poor radial velocities , typically due to the presence of very broad lines ( e.g.  the na d lines ) which result in cross - correlation peaks that do not lend themselves well to centroiding . in addition",
    ", we were unable to securely identify the peak corresponding to the secondary star in most orders , due to other low - level structure in the cross - correlation function . to be conservative",
    ", we thus typically only accepted a few very good orders , orders where the spectral features of the secondary are particularly strong .",
    "finally , we found that it was necessary to avoid spectral regions with strong nebular emission , which often subtracted poorly .",
    "by carefully selecting the spectral regions to be used in each order for each spectrum , we were able to maximize the number of orders yielding radial velocities .",
    "for the secondary star , we use all orders that unambiguously show a secondary peak to define a mean radial velocity in each spectrum . with the primary star , for which most of the spectral orders yield a velocity measurement",
    ", we can be even more discriminating to maximize our precision . as shown in fig .",
    "[ xcorl - fig]b , the scatter in the primary radial velocities produced by the different spectral orders is a function of correlation peak height ; empirically , we find that the scatter is smallest among spectral orders that yield correlation peak heights above a certain threshhold value , typically around 0.6 ( as in the example of fig .  [ xcorl - fig]b ) .",
    "we thus determine primary radial velocities from each spectrum by taking the mean of only those spectral orders with correlation peak heights greater than this threshold . finally , we further refined the primary velocities by iteratively excluding orders that deviated by greater than 2@xmath98 from the mean , which typically resulted in the rejection of at most one order per spectrum .    in table [ vel - table ]",

    "cross - correlation peaks in close proximity to one another can suffer from  peak pulling \" , whereby blending of the two components can cause apparent shifts in the peak centroids .",
    "in addition , partial blocking of the stellar disc of one star by the other causes the stellar line profiles of the blocked star to become asymmetric , narrower , and shifted with respect to the center - of - mass velocity . for our orbit solution analysis we thus discarded measurements obtained within 0.05 phase of either eclipse , thereby ensuring that the correlation peaks would be reasonably well separated and that occultation effects would not be a concern . the only exception to this",
    "is the spectrum obtained on ut 2002 feb 21 , which occurs at the phase where the secondary is almost completely eclipsed by the primary , so that the secondary spectrum is practically not present in the observed light .",
    "the presence of spots on the stellar surfaces can also introduce distortions that affect the observed radial velocities .",
    "the importance of this effect for our observations can be evaluated from the light curve solutions discussed below , which include the effects of spots .",

    "for each spot on each star , four parameters are added to the wd calculation : the longitude and co - latitude of the spot , the spot radius ( as seen from the center of the star ) , and the spot temperature factor ( @xmath202 for cold spots and @xmath193 for hot spots ) .    in this phase of the calculation",
    ", we found the simplex method to be much more efficient in finding best - fit solutions than the least - squares method , the latter being very sensitive to small corrections to the spot parameters , leading to frequent divergence of the solution .",
    "although the wd algorithm can deal with spots that move in longitude across the surface of the star , we assumed that the spots rotate with the same angular velocity as the star .",
    "after convergence of each set of spots , we tried many different combinations of spot number and configurations , trying to minimize the number of spots on each star .",
    "note that the wd code treats regions in which multiple spots overlap by multiplying their temperature factors .",
    "ultimately , both `` cold '' and `` hot '' spots were needed on each star to reproduce the light curves of fig .",
    "[ ivybvlc ] .",
    "the cold spots made it necessary to extrapolate in the atmosphere tables , as mentioned above for the secondary star , for some points on the surface of the primary star as well .",
    "the calculations with atmosphere tables were compared with calculations using blackbodies , and we concluded that the extrapolation done ( linearly in a logarithmic scale ) was reasonable .",
    "thus , except for the @xmath10 light curves for which @xcite did not publish atmosphere calculations , we thus chose to use atmosphere models instead of simple planck functions .",
    "there exist multiple combinations of spots that can reproduce the observed out - of - eclipse variations reasonably well .",
    "we believe that the 3 spots on each star used in our final solution ( table [ spotsall ] ) are physically realistic .",
    "moreover , our use of light curves in five different bands makes the spot solution more robust , as we insisted that one spot configuration reproduce all of the light curves simultaneously . in any case , the goal of including spots in the light curve modeling is not to determine the properties of the spots per se , but rather to better constrain the morphology of the light curves around the eclipses and thereby to minimize the uncertainty in the parameters of true import : the system inclination , the ratio of @xmath170 , and the stellar radii .",
    "the jan 2001 light curves proved impossible to fit together unless we included @xmath16610% third light in @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath19 light curve required a slightly _ negative _ amount of third light , which is physically meaningless .",
    "we thus forced @xmath203 , but left this parameter free to be adjusted at the other wavelengths .",
    "the final solution is shown in figs .",
    "[ ivybvlc ] and [ ivybvres ] and in tables [ wd5 ] and [ spotsall ] . with the exception of @xmath16 ,",
    "the significance of the @xmath204 values found for the light curves is questionable as they do not follow a planckian distribution with wavelength .",
    "they are probably artifacts of the data - reduction process ( e.g.  background subtraction in the aperture photometry , scattered light , etc . ) .",

    "it is valuable and instructive to consider what insights can be gained from the observations alone , independently of the models .",
    "first of all , it appears clear that the masses of the components of ntt  045251@xmath2663016  are over - estimated .",
    "the primary star is at a very similar position in the h - r diagram to that of the 1.01 m@xmath3 primary of , despite having a measured mass that is considerably larger .",
    "it does have a somewhat higher luminosity , so it is possible that it does indeed have a slightly higher mass than does a. this conclusion is bolstered by the secondary of ntt  045251@xmath2663016 ; its position in the h - r diagram , suggesting a mass slightly less than the 0.73 m@xmath3 secondary of , belies its measured mass of 0.81 m@xmath3 . that ntt  045251@xmath2663016  may be an outlier",
    "may not be surprising given the large uncertainties inherent to the analysis of this astrometric binary , for which only @xmath306 of the orbit has been mapped @xcite .",
    "indeed , simply adjusting the mass of the ntt  045251@xmath2663016  primary down by 12@xmath98 , while keeping the mass ratio fixed , would appear to bring the measurements of ntt  045251@xmath2663016  and into closer empirical agreement .",

    "for example , the fractional uncertainty reported by them for the luminosity of rxj0529.4@xmath2660041  a ( 8% ) is smaller than the fractional uncertainty they report ( 11% ) for the radius alone . including the uncertainty in @xmath170  as well gives a more appropriate uncertainty in the luminosity of @xmath301 .    in some cases ,",
    "the observations place objects of similar masses at similar positions in the h - r diagram , bolstering their credibility .",
    "for example , the primary of and lkca  15 , both with @xmath307 , have very nearly the same @xmath170  and @xmath259 .",
    "the same is true for rxj0529.4@xmath2660041  b and gm  aur , both with @xmath308 .",
    "even though these latter measurements have somewhat larger uncertainties , the lower luminosity of rxj0529.4@xmath2660041  b relative to ( the presumably younger ) gm  aur in effect provides an empirical mass track for @xmath308 between @xmath166310 myr .",

    "this is worrisome . one way to reconcile",
    "this apparent contradiction is to have mass tracks , like the mlt atlas9 tracks of @xcite , that are double - valued in @xmath170  at low masses , allowing stars with different masses to have similar @xmath170  at certain times . while these tracks do not presently extend to the masses of b and dm  tau , inspecting these tracks in fig .",
    "[ luhman - dm ] one can imagine that these stars positions would be well matched by their respective tracks , particularly with dm  tau being somewhat more luminous than b.    another possible explanation for the discordance between these measurements is that the uncertainties in the masses for the single stars are underestimated .",

    "may be as large as @xmath301 , manifesting itself as a systematic error in the dynamical mass determination .",
    "dl  tau may serve as a case in point . its measured mass of 0.72 m@xmath3 is similar to the mass of 0.73 m@xmath3 we have measured for the secondary of . yet dl  tau is 450 k hotter than b , suggesting a mass more comparable to that of a. an important additional clue to the relative masses of these two objects is provided by their relative li abundances . in fig .",

    "its measured @xmath191(li ) , even with its large uncertainties , is too high for its mass .",

    "the observed li abundance of dl  tau implies a lower limit to its mass of @xmath311 , consistent with its location in the h - r diagram relative to a. whether the masses of b and dm  tau can be similarly reconciled is unknown ; there is no published li abundance for dm  tau .    the observed pattern of li depletion with stellar mass provides more general constraints on pms evolutionary tracks , particularly with respect to the efficiency of convection .",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite , models with more efficient convection ( i.e.  larger @xmath5 ) result in dramatically more li depletion than do models with less efficient convection .",
    "consider a star like a , having @xmath312 and situated near the bottom of its hayashi phase of evolution . assuming an initial li abundance of @xmath191(li)@xmath313 , a model with @xmath264 will have @xmath191(li ) @xmath314 whereas a model with a more modest @xmath265 will have @xmath191(li ) @xmath315 @xcite .",
    "the primary of is more consistent with the low li depletion predicted by the @xmath265 model . at lower masses ,",

    "thus the li depletion measurements strongly favor models with low @xmath255 .    at low masses ,",
    "the li depletion levels predicted by the models also become strongly dependent upon the parameter @xmath256 .",
    "larger values of @xmath256 result in a larger fraction of the over - adiabatic region being computed with the low value of @xmath5 adopted in the model atmosphere .",
    "this produces a reduced temperature at the base of the convection zone , resulting in lower levels of li depletion . a more detailed analysis of the observed li abundances as a function of stellar mass is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "but coupled with the precise mass determinations for pms stars , such as we have determined here , the clear pattern of li depletion with stellar mass should in principle provide important additional constraints on various key parameters of pms evolutionary models .",

    "while some models are consistent with the mass of the primary , and others are consistent with the mass of the secondary , none of the models correctly predict the masses of both stars simultaneously .",

    "<S> all of the models predict the observed slope of the mass - radius relationship reasonably well , though the observations tend to favor models with low convection efficiencies . indeed , considering our newly determined mass measurements together with other dynamical mass measurements of pre  main - sequence stars in the literature , as well as measurements of li abundances in these stars , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the data strongly favor evolutionary models with inefficient convection in the stellar interior , even though such models can not reproduce the properties of the present - day sun . </S>"
