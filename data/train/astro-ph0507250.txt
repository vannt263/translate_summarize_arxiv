    "in recent decades , the observations of high redshift type ia supernovae have revealed that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion rather than decelerated expansion @xcite . meanwhile , the discovery of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy on degree scales together with the galaxy redshift surveys indicate @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that the universe is permeated smoothly by dark energy which has a negative pressure and violates the strong energy condition .",
    "the dark energy and accelerating universe have been discussed extensively from different points of view @xcite . in principle , a natural explanation to the cosmic acceleration is the cosmological constant .",
    "however , there exist serious theoretical problems such as the fine tuning problem and coincidence problem . to overcome the fine tuning problem , a self - interacting scaler field , dubbed quintessence , with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath9 was introduced , where @xmath10 is time varying and negative .",
    "thus , by properly choosing the forms of the potential @xmath11 , desired behaviors of the quintessence can be obtained : ( i ) with a negative pressure which drives the universe accelerated expansion ; ( ii ) with an energy density that was much smaller than that of the ordinary matter ( and radiation ) at early times ( due to the constrains from primordial nucleosynthesis and structure formation ) and is comparable to the latter at recent times . to resolve the coincidence problem , tracker solutions or scaling solutions",
    "were designed in which there exists a stage where the ratio of potential and kinetic energies of the scalar field remains constant approximately . in this way",
    ", all the initial ` information ' could be eliminated .",
    "so , in the past , if the ratio of the densities of dark energy and matter is approximately constant , the coincidence problem could be avoided .",
    "it has been drawn great attention to the idea that our universe is a 4-dimensional hypersurfce embedded in a higher dimensional world as is in kaluza - klein theories and in brane world scenarios . here",
    "we consider the 5-dimensional space - time - matter ( stm ) theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is distinguished from the classical kaluza - klein theory by that it has an non - compact fifth dimension and that it is empty viewed from @xmath6 and sourceful viewed from @xmath12 .",
    "that is , in stm theory , the @xmath6 manifold is ricci - flat which implies that the five - dimensional space - time is empty , the matter of our universe is induced from the fifth dimension , and the @xmath12 hypersurface is curved by this induced matter .",
    "mathematically , this approach is supported by campbell s theorem @xcite which says that any analytical solution of einstein field equation of @xmath13 dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold of @xmath14 dimensions , though there is an argument recently concerning campbell s theorem @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a class of five - dimensional cosmological models @xcite of the stm theory .",
    "this class of exact solutions satisfies the @xmath6 ricci - flat equations @xmath15 and is algebraically rich because it contains two arbitrary functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that several properties characterize these @xmath6 models : ( i ) the @xmath12 induced matter could be described by a perfect fluid plus a variable cosmological constant. ( ii ) by properly choosing the two arbitrary functions , both the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated standard frw models could be recovered .",
    "( iii ) the big bang singularity of the @xmath12 standard cosmology is replaced by a big bounce at which the universe reaches to a finite and minimal size . before the bounce ,",
    "the universe contracts ; after the bounce , it expands .",
    "also , the evolution of the universe containing three components was discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that the universe is permeated smoothly by cdm+baryons @xmath18 as well as dark energy @xmath19 with pressure @xmath20 at late time .",
    "we will show that a scaling solution can be obtained which is different from the conventional scaling solutions and late - time attractors : ( i ) there exists a scaling stage before the transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion , and so the coincidence problem could be resolved ; ( ii ) during this stage , the dark energy has the equation of state @xmath21 and behaves like a cold dark matter - this would provide a unified model for dark matter and dark energy as the chaplygin gas model does @xcite .",
    "given an appropriate form of @xmath0 , we will find that before @xmath2 , the dark energy behaves like a ` tracker ' solution and mimics cdm+baryons .",
    "the transition from deceleration to acceleration is at @xmath5 , which agrees with recent cosmological observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ de5 ] , we assume that the induced matter of the universe contains two components : cdm+baryons and dark energy .",
    "we write down einstein field equations and the equation of states ( eos ) of dark energy . in section [ p ] , we rewrite these equations via redshift @xmath22 , then the arbitrary functions @xmath23 contained in the @xmath6 solution corresponds to a function @xmath24 , which is found to play a similar role as the potential @xmath1 in quintessence and phantom models .",
    "with use of a kind of hyperbolic function of @xmath24 , a scaling stage is obtained . also , we discuss the evolution of the dimensionless density parameters , the eos of dark energy , the deceleration parameter and the clustering of dark energy .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is a conclusion .",
    "within the framework of stm theory , a class of exact @xmath6 cosmological solution was presented by liu and mashhoon in 1995 @xcite . then , in 2001 , liu and wesson @xcite restudied the solution and showed that it describes a cosmological model with a big bounce as opposed to a big bang .",
    "the @xmath6 metric of this solution reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are two arbitrary functions of @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 curvature index @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "this solution satisfies the 5d vacuum equation @xmath15 .",
    "so , the three invariants are @xmath35 the invariant @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ 3-invar ] ) shows that @xmath34 determines the curvature of the 5d manifold .",
    "here we should mention that because the @xmath6 field equations of the stm theory are always sourceless , i.e. , @xmath37 or @xmath15 , there is no need to introduce a higher - dimensional newtonian constant or a higher - dimensional planck mass in the theory .",
    "this is one of the main differences between stm theory and other kaluza - klein theories .    using the @xmath12 part of the @xmath6 metric ( [ 5-metric ] ) to calculate the @xmath12 einstein tensor , one obtains @xmath38 in the previous work @xcite , the induced matter was set to be a conventional matter plus a time variable cosmological ` constant ' . in this paper , we assume that the induced matter contains two parts : one is cdm+baryons @xmath18 with pressure @xmath39 , the other is the dark energy @xmath40 with pressure @xmath41 .",
    "so , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 from eqs.([frw - eq ] ) and ( [ eos - x ] ) , one obtains the eos of dark energy @xmath44 and the dimensionless density parameters @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the proper definitions of the hubble and deceleration parameters should be given as @xcite , @xmath47 from which we see that @xmath48 represents an accelerating universe , @xmath49 represents a decelerating universe .",
    "so the function @xmath23 plays a crucial role in determining the properties of the universe at late times .",
    "it was pointed out that another arbitrary function @xmath50 may relate closely to the early epoch of the universe @xcite .",
    "we consider the spatial flat case @xmath51 . from the solution ( [ a - b ] )",
    "we see that on a given @xmath52 hypersurface we have @xmath53 .",
    "so , without loss of generality , one can always write @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 is fixed , where @xmath22 is the redshift , @xmath57 . now we define @xmath58 and then we find that eqs .",
    "( [ wx])-([df ] ) reduce to @xmath59 here the subscript @xmath60 denotes the point where @xmath61 ( which is @xmath62 when the radiation is neglected ) . as is known from quintessence and phantom dynamical dark energy models , the potential @xmath63 is unfixed . by",
    "choose different forms of @xmath11 , desired properties of dark energy could be obtained @xcite .",
    "now , there is an arbitrary function @xmath24 in the present @xmath6 model .",
    "different choice of @xmath24 corresponds to different choice of the potential @xmath11 .",
    "this enables us to look for desired properties of the universe via eqs .",
    "( [ wx-2])-([q ] ) .    to obtain a scaling solution",
    ", there should be a stage where the ratio of the energy densities of dark energy and dark matter is approximately constant .",
    "so , the condition for exiting a scaling stage at late time is @xmath64 . from eqs .",
    "( [ omigam-2 ] ) and ( [ omigax-2 ] ) , this condition leads to @xmath65}{dz } \\approx 0 , \\label{condition}.\\ ] ] also , to obtain an accelerating universe at late times , some mechanics is needed to break the scaling state steeply and make the dark energy dominated . in @xcite , a hyperbolic function @xmath66 as a leap kinetic term to achieve the desired features of quintessence is discussed .",
    "so , in our case , to have a scaling dark energy , we let @xmath0 being of a similar form , @xmath67+c}{1+z } , \\label{f}\\ ] ] where , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are arbitrary constants and can be estimated by observation data , i.e. by using @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "then we obtain the values of @xmath74 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath75 where , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . using the equation @xmath78",
    ", we can solve @xmath74 numerically by leaving @xmath70 as a free parameter which could be determined by the constraints from structure formation ( in this paper we take @xmath79 ) .",
    "so , the function @xmath24 describes the evolution of cdm+baryons and dark energy completely at late time .    under the choice of the function @xmath24 in the form of ( [ f ] ) , the ratio of the dimensionless density parameters @xmath80 and",
    "@xmath81 becomes constant when @xmath82 , that is to say , the dark energy is scaling with the matter .",
    "and the eos of dark energy is @xmath83 , though it is negative in nature .",
    "thus we conclude that just not a long time ago , the eos became negative and the dark energy began to drive the universe to accelerate . for different values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath74 and @xmath87 are listed in table [ t-1 ] .",
    ".values of parameters @xmath86 , @xmath74 and @xmath87 for different @xmath84 and @xmath85 and for @xmath79 . [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that the transition point from deceleration to acceleration is at @xmath5 , which is compatible with current observations .",
    "also , for a larger @xmath84 , a larger absolute value of @xmath87 is needed to drive the universe accelerating . for the case of @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( which corresponds to @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , we plot the evolution of dimensionless density parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , eos of dark energy @xmath94 , and deceleration parameter @xmath95 versus redshift @xmath22 in fig . [ all ] .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed of the dark energy is @xmath96 where , in terms of the redshift @xmath22 , the pressure @xmath97 is @xmath98 we plot the adiabatic sound speed @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath79 .    from fig .",
    "[ fs ] we find that the adiabatic sound speed of the dark energy is @xmath3 during the scaling stage .",
    "so , it behaves like the conventional matter with an almost zero @xmath94 .",
    "however , for @xmath100 , the sound speed @xmath101 becomes wild and even negative - this is also encountered in other unified dark matter and dark energy models .",
    "note that before @xmath102 the dark energy with @xmath103 and @xmath104 behaves like a dark matter ( but not identical to it because @xmath94 is negative in nature ) .",
    "however , one should take into account the clustering of dark energy seriously .",
    "as did in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a universe containing only the dark energy with @xmath103 and the perturbation @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the dark energy density .",
    "since @xmath107 , the jean s instability equation is modified , @xmath108\\frac{d\\delta}{d a}+\\left(\\frac{\\kappa^{2}c^{2}_{s}}{\\mathcal{h}^{2}}-\\frac{3}{2}b[c^{2}_{s},w_{x}]\\right)\\delta=0,\\label{perturb}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the frw scale factor , @xmath109 ( the prime denotes the derivative w.r.t . the conformal time ) , @xmath110=1 - 5w_{x}+2c^{2}_{s}$ ] and @xmath111=1 - 6c^{2}_{s}+8w_{x}-3w_{x}^{2}$ ] . in general ,",
    "the `` growing '' solution is @xmath112 where @xmath113^{1/2}\\right)$ ] . for @xmath114 , @xmath115 ,",
    "the solution @xmath116 is the conventional dust - dominated growing solution . for a small but none - zero @xmath117 and @xmath94 , the dark energy may cluster during scaling .",
    "however , the process is slower than the conventional dust - dominated case . and",
    "once @xmath118 ( for all @xmath119 ) , @xmath120 will less than zero and the dark energy stop clustering .",
    "as @xcite does , the growth exponent @xmath121 is defined as @xmath122 which is roughly @xmath31-independent for a wide range of @xmath31 . and , the _ growth factor _",
    "@xmath123 of density perturbations between arbitrary @xmath124 is defined as @xmath125 with a suitably defined average growth exponent @xmath121 .",
    "for example , the scaling stage begins at the dark matter dominated point @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 , decoupled epoch ) and ends at @xmath128 ( or @xmath102 ) , we have the growth factor @xmath129 .",
    "after the scaling stage and if there is no clustering as expected , we have @xmath130 and @xmath131 roughly . in our case ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath120 versus redshift @xmath22 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] numerically .    in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] , we find that the singular points exist which correspond to a negative infinity for @xmath120 .",
    "so , after this stage , we can not find any clustering dark energy in the universe at present .",
    "however , we must point out that the wild properties of the dark energy might be out of our knowledge and make the dark energy more mysterious .",
    "the influence of early dark energy on cmb anisotropy was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that large @xmath81 is ruled out by cosmic observations . in our case ,",
    "the dimensionless energy density @xmath81 in scaling stage depends on the parameter @xmath70 mainly , we can choose the parameters properly to fit observational constraints . from fig .",
    "[ all ] , we find that @xmath132 at scaling stage which is in compatible with observations . in @xcite , a general formula to calculate @xmath133",
    "was given as @xmath134 in our case , during the scaling stage , the dark energy behaves like dark matter with a zero pressure .",
    "so , comparing the model with the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) ( @xmath135 ) , we have @xmath136 moreover , observations such as cluster abundance constraints yield @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath120 is slightly model dependent and usually @xmath138 .",
    "so , in our case , we have @xmath139 so , the ratio is @xmath140 which is close to unity and compatible with observations .",
    "a general class of @xmath6 cosmological models is characterized by a big bounce as opposed to the big bang in @xmath12 standard cosmological model .",
    "this exact solution contains two arbitrary functions @xmath23 and @xmath141 , which are in analogy with the different forms of the potential @xmath11 in quintessence or phantom dark energy models .",
    "also , once the forms of the arbitrary functions are specified , the universe evolution will be determined . in this bounce model",
    ", we assume the universe to contain at late time two components : cdm+baryons and dark energy .",
    "instead of choosing the forms of the arbitrary functions @xmath142 and @xmath50 , we transform @xmath142 from coordinate time @xmath30 to redshift @xmath22 .",
    "so , the choice of @xmath142 becomes the choice of @xmath24 .",
    "then , we let @xmath24 to be of the form of a hyperbolic function ( [ f ] ) and study the evolution of the universe . we find that there is a scaling stage before @xmath2 , in which the dark energy has constant ratio with cdm+baryons and behaves like a pressureless cold dark matter with @xmath83 . after that",
    ", the pressure of the dark energy deviates from @xmath83 and gradually becomes much more negative .",
    "the transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion is at @xmath5 which , together with other predictions of the present @xmath6 model , is in agreement with current observations .",
    "thus we see that the arbitrary function @xmath24 of the @xmath6 model plays a similar role as the potential @xmath11 in quintessence or phantom models in eliminating the initial ` information ' , then the coincidence problem is resolved .",
    "also , this kind of model would provide a unified model for dark matter and dark energy .",
    "however , we also see from fig [ fs ] and [ gamma ] that several singular points for @xmath143 .",
    "perhaps , these singularities correspond to some unknown phase transition .",
