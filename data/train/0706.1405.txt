    "* section 2.4 ) for elementary properties of the absolute order and related historical remarks and mention that the pair @xmath12 is a graded poset having the identity @xmath13 as its unique minimal element and rank function @xmath14 .",
    "the significance of the absolute order in combinatorics , group theory , invariant theory and representation theory stems from the following facts .",
    "first , it can be viewed as an analogue of the weak order ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) on @xmath0 ( this order can be defined by replacing the generating set of all reflections in @xmath0 , in the definition of the absolute order , with the set of simple reflections ) .",
    "second , the maximal chains in intervals of the form @xmath15 $ ] correspond to reduced words of @xmath5 with respect to the alphabet @xmath1 and are relevant in the study of conjugacy classes in @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "* section 3.20 ) of @xmath0 and @xmath19 is its rank .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath20 denotes a coxeter element of @xmath0 , then the combinatorial structure of the intervals in @xmath12 of the form @xmath21 $ ] , known as _ noncrossing partition lattices _ , plays an important role in the construction of new monoid structures and @xmath22 spaces for artin groups associated with @xmath0 ; see for instance @xcite .    when @xmath20 is a coxeter element , the intervals @xmath21 $ ] in the absolute order have pleasant combinatorial and topological properties .",
    "in particular , they were shown to be shellable in @xcite .",
    "the question of determining the topology of @xmath23 was raised by reiner @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
