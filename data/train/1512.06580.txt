    "the directed percolation ( dp ) process @xcite is one of the most important model , that describes formation of the fractal structures .",
    "the distinctive property of dp is the exhibition of non - equilibrium second order phase transition @xcite between absorbing ( inactive ) and active state .",
    "similar to the equilibrium critical behavior , emerging scale invariant behavior , can be analyzed with the help of renormalization group ( rg ) technique .",
    "the deviations from the ideal models are known to have a profound effect .",
    "the main aim of this study is to describe how the directed percolation process in the presence of compressible velocity fluctuations can be analyzed in the framework of field - theoretic formulation .",
    "the continuum description of dp in terms of a density field @xmath0 arises from a coarse - graining procedure in which a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom were averaged out .",
    "the mathematical model has to respect the absorbing state condition , that is @xmath1 is always a stationary state .",
    "the coarse grained stochastic equation then reads @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the noise term , @xmath4 is the time derivative , @xmath5 is the laplace operator , @xmath6 is the diffusion constant , @xmath7 is the coupling constant and @xmath8 measures deviation from the criticality .",
    "the gaussian noise term @xmath3 with zero mean stands for the neglected fast microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "its correlation function must respect absorbing state condition and it can be chosen in the following form @xmath9 the next step consists in the incorporation of the velocity fluctuations into the equation ( [ eq : basic ] ) . the standard route based on the the replacement @xmath10 by the lagrangian derivative @xmath11 is not sufficient due to the assumed compressibility . as was shown in @xcite the additional parameter @xmath12 has to be introduced via following replacement @xmath13 the choice @xmath14 corresponds to the conserved quantity @xmath15 , whereas for the choice @xmath16 the conserved quantity is @xmath17 .",
    "the full description of the model requires specification of the velocity field . following the work @xcite the velocity field",
    "is considered to be a random gaussian variable with zero mean and correlator @xmath18 where @xmath19 is dimension of the space and the kernel function @xmath20 is chosen in the form @xmath21",
    "\\frac{g_{10 } u_{10 } d_0 ^ 3 k^{4-d - y-\\eta}}{\\omega^2 + u_{10}^2 d_0 ^ 2 ( k^{2-\\eta})^2}.    \\label{eq : kerneld}\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is transverse and @xmath23 longitudinal projection operator , @xmath24 , positive parameter @xmath25 can be interpreted as a deviation from the incompressibility condition @xmath26 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath27 and exponent @xmath28 describe the equal - time velocity correlator or equivalently , the energy spectrum of the velocity fluctuations . on the other hand parameter @xmath29 and exponent @xmath3 describe dispersion behavior of the mode @xmath30 .",
    "the exponents @xmath28 and @xmath3 are analogous to the standard expansion parameter @xmath31 in the static critical phenomena @xcite . according to the general rules of the rg approach",
    "we formally assume that the exponents @xmath32 and @xmath3 are of the same order of magnitude and in principle they constitute small expansion parameters in a perturbation sense .    for the effective use of rg method",
    "it is advantageous to reformulate the stochastic problem ( [ eq : basic]-[eq : kerneld ] ) into the field - theoretic language .",
    "this can be achieved in the standard fashion @xcite and the resulting dynamic functional can be written as a sum @xmath33 = \\j _ { \\text{diff}}[\\varphi ]     + \\j_{\\text{vel}}[\\varphi ]     + \\j_{\\text{int}}[\\varphi ] ,      \\label{eq : bare_act}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 stands for the complete set of fields and @xmath35 is the response field .",
    "the corresponding terms have the following form @xmath36 & =   &    \\int \\drm t \\int \\drm^{d } \\mx \\biggl\\ {    \\tilde{\\psi } [    \\partial_t - d_0\\boldnabla^2+d_0\\tau_0    ] \\psi \\biggl\\},\\\\    \\label{eq : act_diffuse }    % -------------------------------------------------------------------%    \\j_{\\text{vel}}[\\mv ] & = & -\\frac{1}{2 }     \\int \\drm t_1 \\int \\drm t_2     \\int \\drm^d \\mx_1 \\int \\drm^d \\mx_2    \\mbox { }    \\mv_i(t_1,x_1 )    d_{ij}^{-1}(t_1-t_2,\\mx_1-\\mx_2 ) \\mv_j(t_2,\\mx_2),\\\\    \\label{eq : vel_action }    %",

    "\\label{eq : inter_act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        all but third term in ( [ eq : inter_act ] ) stems directly stems from the nonlinear terms in ( [ eq : basic ] ) and ( [ eq : subs ] ) .",
    "the third term proportional to @xmath37 deserves a special consideration .",
    "presence of such term is prohibited in the original kraichnan model due to the underlying galilean invariance .",
    "however in our case the finite time correlations of the velocity fluctuations does not impose such restriction . in the language of feynman graphs",
    ", one can show that such term will indeed be generated as can be readily seen considering first three graphs in the following expansion @xmath38 we conclude that compressibility and non - galilean nature of the velocity correlator lead to the quite involved situation , which requires analysis .",
    "note , that in the incompressible case @xcite presence of a given term does not lead to the significant effects .",
    "the field - theoretic formulation summarized in ( [ eq : act_diffuse])-([eq : inter_act ] ) has an advantage to be amenable to the machinery of field theory @xcite .",
    "near criticality @xmath39 large fluctuations on all scales dominate the behavior of the system , which results into the divergences in feynman graphs .",
    "the rg technique allows us to deal with them and as a result it allows for pertubative computation of critical exponent in a formal expansion around upper critical dimension .",
    "thus provides us with information about the scaling behavior of green functions .",
    "the renormalization of the model can be achieved through the relations @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the reference mass scale in the ms scheme  @xcite .",
    "in this brief article we have summarized main points of the field - theoretic study of directed percolation process in the presence of compressible velocity field .",
    "the detailed results for the renormalization constants and analysis of the scaling behavior will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
