    "according to the standard view , the prompt grb emission is produced behind internal shocks that form in the coasting region of a baryon loaded fireball ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the emission mechanism commonly invoked is synchrotron cooling of relativistic electrons that are accelerated at the shock front , perhaps accompanied by synchrotron - self compton emission at highest energies . in order to be able to accelerate particles",
    "the shocks must be collisionless .",
    "as argued below ( see also levinson & bromberg 2008 , hereafter lb08 ) , under the conditions anticipated such shocks can only form in regions where the optical depth for thomson scattering is smaller than unity , as otherwise the radiation produced in the shock transition and in the immediate downstream mediates the shock via compton scattering .",
    "thus , an implicit assumption of the standard fireball model is that a significant fraction of the bulk energy dissipates above the photosphere .",
    "the fireball model outlined above was originally motivated by the detection of nonthermal spectra in many grbs . despite some difficulties in associating the low energy part of the spectrum with optically thin synchrotron emission ( e.g. crider et al .",
    "1997 ; preece et al .",
    "1998 ) , some believed that this model can account for the band spectrum @xcite inferred in many sources .",
    "the difficulties with the synchrotron model , as well as other considerations ( e.g. eichler & levinson 2000 ) , have led to the suggestion that photospheric emission may contribute to the prompt grb spectrum , in addition to the observed non - thermal component ( e.g. mszros & rees 2000 , mszros _",
    "et al_. 2002 ) . at the same time",
    ", it has been argued that a combination of a thermal and a nonthermal components can fit better the data in quite a number of bursts ( e.g. ryde 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , peer _ et al_. 2007 , peer 2008 ) .",
    "the recent detections of a prominent thermal peaks in several lat bursts , notably grb 090902b @xcite , provide a strong support to this interpretation .",
    "the conditions at the shock formation region depend on the power and lorentz factor of the outflow and the duty cycle of the central engine . for shells to collide above the photosphere",
    ", the lorentz factor must be large enough . as shown below , in some bursts , e.g. , grb 080916c , internal shocks",
    "are expected to form above the photospher , whereas in others , e.g. , grb 090902b , a major fraction of the energy is likely to dissipate below the photosphere , albeit in a region of moderate optical depth .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of grb 080916c is well fitted by a broken power law @xcite , while that of grb 090902b exhibits a thermal peak @xcite .",
    "the above considerations motivate detailed investigation of the properties of shocks that form below the photosphere , in regions where the thomson optical depth exceeds unity .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that such shocks are mediated by compton scattering of radiation produced in the shock transition layer or convected by the upstream flow ( lb08 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical width of the shock transition , a few thomson mean free paths , is much larger than any kinetic scale involved , rendering particle acceleration in such shocks highly unlikely .",
    "thus , the photon spectrum produced in relativistic radiation mediated shocks ( rrms ) may be considerably different than that anticipated in collisionless shocks .",
    "moreover , the radiation produced downstream is trapped for times much longer than the shock crossing time , and diffuses out after the shock breaks out of the photosphere and becomes collisionless .",
    "consequently , any rapid fluctuations of the flow parameters will be smeared out , and may not be imprinted in the observed gamma - ray emission .    in this paper",
    "we explore the role of rrms in the prompt phase of grbs . a qualitative discussion of rms is given in  2 . in ",
    "3 we analyze regimes in the parameter space in which overtaking collisions of shells occur below and above the photosphere . in ",
    "4 we investigate the properties of rrms that form during the prompt grb phase .",
    "we show that under conditions anticipated in many grbs , such relativistic radiation mediated shocks convect enough radiation from the upstream to render photon production in the shock transition negligible , unlike the case of shock breakout in supernovae and hypernovae ( e.g. , weaver 1977 ; katz et al .",
    "bulk comptonization then produces a relatively low thermal peak , followed by a broad , nonthermal component in the immediate downstream . to illustrate some properties of the spectrum we present , in  5",
    ", test particle monte carlo simulations of bulk comptonization .",
    "the shock structure computed in lb08 is used as input to these simulations . in the regime where photon convection is important the analysis of lb08",
    "is justified , and the shock solutions obtained there present reasonable approximations .",
    "we find that a hard tail extending up to the kn limit ( roughly @xmath2 in the observer frame ) is a generic feature of rrms in grbs .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "the structure of non - relativistic rms was first studied by @xcite , @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "these authors assumed that the plasma and the radiation field maintain local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at the shock transition , giving rise to a black body spectrum . under this assumption the temperature increases monotonically from the upstream to the downstream .",
    "@xcite extended this analysis to include conditions anticipated in supernovae shock breakout , where the upstream is cold and photon poor .",
    "he showed that when the shock velocity exceeds @xmath3c and the upstream temperature @xmath4 ev , where @xmath5 is the baryons mass in units of @xmath6 gr , the photon production rate is insufficient to sustain a black body distribution within the shock transition . as a consequence , the photons can only maintain wien equilibrium with the plasma , defined as a planck spectrum with a non - vanishing chemical potential , and a temperature equal to that of the electrons .",
    "since fewer photons supply the shock pressure , the temperature rises above its value at the far downstream , where thermodynamic equilibrium is re - established . at @xmath7",
    "the peak temperature reaches values of @xmath8 kev , approximately two orders of magnitude above the black - body temperature further downstream . at such velocities",
    "the photon production rate in the transition region is negligible , and the majority of photons which support the shock are created downstream of the deceleration zone , and diffuse back to the upstream @xcite .",
    "higher upstream velocities lead to increased pair production- and annihilation rates up to a point where the amount of mev photons begins to affect the flow . in this case",
    ", the full kn cross section must be used to correctly solve the shock .",
    "rms in this limit are analyzed by @xcite .",
    "when the photon - to - electron ratio in the upstream region is high enough , the total production rate of photons in the transition region ( due to local emission processes and diffusion from the downstream ) is negligible ; it may be assumed that the photon number is conserved within the shock .",
    "blandford & payne ( 1981a , b ; hereafter bp81a , b ) investigated such shocks in the limit of non relativistic upstreams and vanishing thermal effects , and obtained a self - consistent solution for the structure of the shock and for the transmitted radiation spectrum .",
    "they showed that photons which are advected with the flow across the shock , can diffuse back to the upstream and traverse the shock once more . in each crossing",
    "the photons gain a small amount of energy as a result of the flow compression .",
    "some of these photons are caught in the shock , and by experiencing this process multiple times , undergo a substantial energy buildup , resulting in a power law tail which extends to high energies , similar to first order fermi acceleration of cosmic rays ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the solution provided by bp81b for the transmitted spectrum is valid as long as the average energy gain per scattering due to compressional heating ( bulk motion ) , @xmath9 , sufficiently exceeds the corresponding energy gain due to thermal comptonization @xmath10 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the requirement that the compton parameter satisfies @xmath11 , and holds for fast , cold flows .",
    "bp81b solution was generalized by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to include thermal processes as well .    in the non - relativistic regime , where the upstream velocity @xmath12 and the temperature across the shock @xmath13 , several approximations can be made which greatly reduce the complexity of the solution .",
    "firstly , the thomson cross section @xmath14 can be used in the radiation transfer equation , instead of the full kn formula . secondly , as the radiation field anisotropy in the fluid rest frame",
    "is always small , the motion of the photons across the shock can be regarded as a diffusive process . in such process",
    "the number of scatterings that a photon undergoes as it passes through the shock deceleration region is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the width of the deceleration region and @xmath17 is the photon mean free path . if the diffusion time roughly equals to the shock crossing time then @xmath18 .",
    "consequently @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally , to order @xmath21 , the radiation field satisfies the equation of state @xmath22 , which provides a closure condition for the set of hydrodynamic equations governing the shock structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when @xmath23 approaches unity the photon distribution function becomes highly anisotropic and the diffusion approximation breaks down .",
    "a completely different method of solution is then required .",
    "in addition , pair creation inside the shock transition may be important and needs a proper treatment .",
    "lb08 computed the structure of the shock transition for various upstream condition , using multiple moments expansion of the transfer equation .",
    "they assumed that the photon number is roughly conserved across the shock transition , which is justified when photon advection by the upstream fluid dominates over photon production , and neglected pair creation by nonthermal photons .",
    "they found , as expected , that the thickness of the shock is of the order of a few thomson lengths .",
    "recently , @xcite calculated numerically the structure and spectrum of rrms for sufficiently relativistic , cold upstream .",
    "they have shown that the spectrum consists of a thermal peak at @xmath24 roughly , followed by a hard tail that extends up to @xmath25 , as measured in the shock frame .",
    "the high temperature in the immediate downstream is a consequence of the paucity of photons advected from the upstream , resulting in intensive pair cascade at the immediate downstream which keeps the temperature at this level .",
    "a much lower temperature is anticipated in the rrms which are expected to form in the photons rich jets of grbs , as discussed below .",
    "to investigate the conditions under which shells may collide below the photosphere we consider a conical fireball having an isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the fireball is ejected with an initial lorentz factor @xmath27 from a compact central engine of radius @xmath28 , and that it carries baryons with an isotropic mass loss rate @xmath29 .",
    "the properties of the fireball , and in particular the location of the photosphere depend of the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 . when @xmath31 , where @xmath32 the fireball is sufficiently opaque , such that the radiation is trapped during the entire acceleration phase .",
    "the major fraction of the explosion energy is then converted into bulk kinetic energy of the baryons , and the fireball reaches a terminal lorentz factor @xmath33 at some radius @xmath34 , beyond which it continues to coast . the photosphere is located somewhere in the coasting region , at @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath36 the fireball will become transparent already during the acceleration phase , before reaching the coasting radius @xmath37 .",
    "the loerentz factor in that case is limited by @xmath38 .",

    "dissipation via internal shocks is likely to occur over a range of radii that encompasses the photosphere .",
    "slower shells should collide below the photosphere , at a moderate optical depth ( unless the time separation between consecutive ejections is much larger than the dynamical time of the engine ) , whereas shells ejected with sufficiently large lorentz factor will collide above the photosphere .",
    "the fraction of the energy that dissipates below the photosphere depends on the burst parameters , and may significantly vary from burst to burst .",
    "specific examples , for which measurements of the luminosity and estimates of the lorentz factors are available were analyzed . in case of grb",
    "090902b we conclude that a major fraction of the explosion energy dissipated below the photosphere , in a region of optical depths @xmath216 , via relativistic radiation mediated shocks . for grb 080916c",
    "we find that collision of shells occurred predominantly above the photosphere , giving rise to formation of collisionless shocks .",
    "shocks that form below the photosphere are mediated by compton scattering of radiation produced inside the shock or advected by the upstream flow .",
    "since the scale of the shock , a few thomson lengths , is vastly larger than any kinetic scale involved , particle acceleration by the fermi process is highly unlikely in such shocks . on the other hand ,",
    "bulk comptonization gives rise to a hard spectrum extending above a ( thermal ) wien peak , up to the kn limit @xmath132 ( and perhaps beyond , e.g. , budnik et al .",
    "2010 ) , where @xmath217 is the lorentz factor of the upstream flow , measured in the shock frame .",
    "the mean photon energy in the immediate downstream is determined by the number of photons advected into and/or produced inside the shock . for a cold upstream , a condition expected in shock breakout episodes ,",
    "the wien temperature is @xmath218 ( budnik et al .",
    "however , under the conditions anticipated in the prompt phase of grbs , the shock upstream is photon rich , in the sense that photon advection largely dominates over photon production , and the thermal peak is located at energies well below @xmath24 .",
    "we estimate temperatures in the range between a few and a few tens kev for typical grb parameters .    the existence of the hard spectral component is demonstrated in this work through test particle monte carlo simulations on given shock profiles , that were computed in an earlier work ( levinson and bromberg 2008 ) , neglecting pair production by mev photons and the thermal spread of the electrons .",
    "the resultant spectra extend to the kn limit , which imply that pair production inside the shock is likely to be important in photon rich shocks .",
