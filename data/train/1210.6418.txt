    "quantum theory is well known as one of the most powerful theory in the last century .",
    "although it provides an elegant way to describe the physics of the micro - world , its explanation is so complicated and obscure , that the nobel prize - winning physicist richard p.feynman said that `` i can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics''[1 ] .    from the standard point of view",
    ", quantum theory includes two parts , one is the quantum mechanics(qm ) which focuses on the behavior of quantum particles , for instance , the electrons , the photons ; the other part is the quantum field theory(qft ) which gives the rules for the fields , such as the electromagnetic field .",
    "usually , these two parts are considered to be independent from each other , by treating particles and fields as two kinds of independent physical objects sharing the same quantization scheme . however , from the qft[2 ] , it s easy to find that the particles can be treated as quantum excitations of the corresponding fields , for example , the electron as excitation of electron field or dirac field .",
    "since particles are quantum excitations of fields , then whether qm could be obtained from qft seems to be an interesting question[3 ] .",
    "we will show below that this is possible , and even it provides a new and natural interpretation to qm .",
    "the paper are roughly divided into three major parts . in the first one , we study in details a non - relativistic field , the so called schrdinger field , which is certainly relevant to the ordinary non - relativistic qm .",
    "all of the three standard formula of qm are obtained from this field theory , the schrdinger equation as field equation , the heisenberg equations for the momentum and position operators of the particles after the field quantization , and the feynman path integral formula[4 ] of qm for particles .",
    "then , in the second part , the probability concepts of qm are given in terms of a statistical ensemble , realizing the ensemble interpretation of qm[5 ] .",
    "with these , we further make a series of conceptual modifications to the standard quantum mechanics(sqm , the `` copenhagen interpretation '' ) , especially propose a new assumption about the quantum measurement theory which can solve the epr paradox from the view of the qft . in the end of this part , a field theoretical description to the double - slit interference experiment",
    "is developed , obtaining the required particle number distribution . in the last part , an extension to the relativistic qft",
    "is developed , with a method of separating the particle field from the anti - particle field , so that the ensemble interpretation is still proper .",
    "there are also two additive topics . in the first one ,",
    "an operable experiment is proposed to distinguish the copenhagen interpretation from the ensemble one via very different experimental results .",
    "while the second topic concerns with the extensions of the concept of coherent state for the oscillator to both the bosonic and fermionic field cases , to obtain the corresponding classical fields .",
    "in the concluding section , we make some general analysis on the basic rules of the standard qm , especially we show that the single particle operators are not fundamental , but only as derivations of the qft .",
    "therefore , we conclude that qft is the fundamental theory .",
    "the concept of schrdinger field[6 ] is useful or practical in ( low energy ) many - particle physics in which the particle number @xmath0 is invariant .",
    "theoretically , this concept is related to the so called secondary quantization by treating the qm for particles as a fundamental theory . however",
    ", if the field was treated as a basic element , and the qft as the fundamental theory , then what would happen ?",
    "in this section , we will show the answer to this question .    the action for the schrdinger field can be @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 an external potential , for example the coulomb potential . for simplicity",
    ", we do nt consider the field self - interactions @xmath3 which is necessary in most real physical situations .",
    "in fact , in qft , relativistic or not , interactions are already well developed .    from eq.(1 )",
    ", it s easy to find that the field equation is just the standard schrdinger equation @xmath4 which can also be obtained from the relativistic equations like the dirac equation in the non - relativistic limit . in the sqm",
    ", the schrdinger equation is known as the quantized equation of a particle , with the wave property . however , in qft , after the field quantization , the particles manifest themselves , and satisfy the field equation automatically .    with the canonical quantization , the schrdinger field will satisfy the communicative relations @xmath5_\\mp = \\delta^3(x - y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the minus for bosonic case , plus for fermionic case . in field theory , we need to consider the space - time symmetries of the lagrangian , for example , the symmetry under space - time translation @xmath6 from which we obtain the energy and momentum operators @xmath7 \\\\",
    "p=\\int d^3x \\psi^\\dag(x ) ( -i\\nabla)\\psi(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , we can define another two operators @xmath8 i.e. the position and particle number operators .",
    "among these operators , there are the following communicative relations @xmath9=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath10=i\\int d^3x \\psi^\\dag(x)\\nabla v(x)\\psi(x ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11=-\\frac{1}{m}\\int d^3x \\psi^\\dag(x)\\nabla\\psi(x ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the communicative relations in eq.(3 ) for both the bosonic and fermionic cases .",
    "as is known , @xmath12 generates the time translation for an arbitrary operator @xmath13 constructed with the fields in the qft . ]",
    "@xmath14=-i\\dot o,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so are those in eqs.(9)-(11 ) .",
    "eq.(9 ) says that the particle number is invariant , while the other two are the familiar heisenberg equations of the momentum and position operators .",
    "since all these operators can be represented with the creators and annihilators of particles in the fock space , we can denote a single - particle state as @xmath15 , and let eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) operate on it , we then have the qm for single particle .",
    "in fact , eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) tell us that all the particles satisfy the qm .    up to now , we have obtained two main qm equations , one is the schrdinger equation ( 2 ) as field equation , the other is the system of the heisenberg equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "further , we could obtain the heisenberg uncertainty relation which is believed to be the most important property of qm from the communicative relation @xmath16=i\\delta_{ij}\\int d^3x \\psi^\\dag(x)\\psi(x ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , we can let it operate on @xmath15 to get the relation for single particle in qm .",
    "now we make some studies in the free field case for simplicity @xmath17 then the ( free field ) energy and momentum operators become @xmath18 while the position and particle number operators will be @xmath19 from eq.(12 ) , we can also have a velocity operator @xmath20 which is similar to the velocity of the non - relativistic particle . with these operators(or physical observables ) obtained , what we then need are their eigenstates .",
    "obviously , the momentum state can be easily defined as @xmath21 with normalization @xmath22 , then what is the position state @xmath23 ?",
    "let s define it as follows latexmath:[\\ ] ] i.e. eq.(254 ) is realized in this case .",
    "even for the electron field @xmath440 in eq.(174 ) , the eq.(257 ) is still proper , since the commutating of position operator in eq.(182 ) with the corresponding energy operator is just the velocity operator , which can also be verified directly with @xmath440 substituted , after some tedious computations .    with the above discussions about the single particle operators ,",
    "let s study generally the statistical properties of the ensemble which were briefly exhibited in section ii.a .",
    ", such as eqs.(48 ) and ( 49 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we work still in the non - relativistic case . for a general operator @xmath441 ,",
    "a single particle ensemble state @xmath111 contains almost all the statistical information about some specific property(such as the energy state ) of the single particle system , for example the expectation value @xmath442 , which can also be considered to be the mean value of a collection of particles which realize that ensemble .",
    "furthermore , when considering the fluctuations , we need the expectation value of @xmath443 .",
    "after some computations , we have @xmath444 where the communicative relations in eq.(3 ) are used",
    ". then for the single particle ensemble state @xmath111 , the last term vanishes by using eq.(245 ) , and qm formula is fulfilled , and the fluctuations for single particle can be derived in the familiar way .",
    "however , for a n - particle ensemble , the last term in eq.(258 ) will not vanish , since there are correlations among those particles in the n - particle system .",
    "we can see these with a simple example , for instance , the energy operator together with its eigenstates , obviously , for this case , @xmath445 is @xmath446 , that is the expectation value of the square of the total energy , while the first term in eq.(258 ) is @xmath447 , which lacks the correlations between different energy states .",
    "this is easy to understand , by noting that the n - particle system is as a whole just like a single particle .",
    "therefore , qft is much useful than qm when treating the many - particle systems , and also in this sense , qft is a fundamental theory .",
    "though there may be some special cases , the qm with the standard form of the above three rules is indeed not a fundamental theory generally , not only because qm can be consistently derived from qft both non - relativistically and relativistically , but also because of the non - universality of those assumed rules as a general quantization scheme , for we could not measure or determine theoretically the physical states of the whole(or global ) field in general[2 ] , but it seems impossible to realize physically .",
    "we can ( classically ) measure exactly the static field , such as the electrostatic field , with a test particle , by observing the motion of the particle , but not possible for a general dynamical field . ] , but only describe them formally mathematically .",
    "what we can obtain or measure are only the states of the particles excited from those fields , and the corresponding local properties . thus in this sense",
    ", qft is the unique fundamental theory in principle , in which fields are fundamental elements of our physical world , in the nowadays experimental limit .",
