    "numerical simulation of lattice qcd offers non - perturbative calculation of correlation functions on the euclidean lattice . while one usually uses the long - distance correlators to extract the mass and matrix elements of hadrons ,",
    "the same correlators at short distances also provide a rich source of information .",
    "the vector current correlator , for instance , may be used to test qcd by comparing the lattice calculation with the experimental data available for the @xmath6 ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the correlator becomes mostly perturbative at high energy scales , but the non - perturbative effect is still important . another important use of the short - distance regime is the application of perturbation theory , from which one can extract the fundamental parameters such as the strong coupling constant @xmath8 and charm quark mass @xmath9 .",
    "the hpqcd and karlsruhe collaboration used the pseudo - scalar charmonium correlator to achieve a precise determination of @xmath9 and @xmath8 @xcite , which has further been improved and extended to include the determination of the bottom quark mass @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to use a perturbative qcd calculation performed at the order of @xmath5 to express temporal moments of the charmonium correlator calculated non - perturbatively on the lattice .",
    "since the perturbative expansion is given as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , one can solve the equations to determine these parameters .",
    "the precision achieved is among the best for these important fundamental parameters of qcd .    in this work",
    "we utilize the same method to extract @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "our lattice data are independent from those used by the hpqcd collaboration .",
    "we use the lattice ensembles generated with 2 + 1 flavors of light sea quarks described by the mbius domain - wall fermion formulation @xcite .",
    "the valence charm quark is also treated by the same fermion formulation .",
    "discretization effects expected for relatively large charm quark mass compared to the lattice spacing are largely removed by extrapolating to the continuum limit using the data at three lattice spacings , @xmath10 0.080 , 0.055 , and 0.044  fm .",
    "the light quark masses in the simulations are in the range corresponding to the pion mass of 230500  mev , which do not cover the physical value but their effect on the charmonium correlator is minor .    on the perturbative side , we use the same perturbative coefficients as those in the previous works @xcite .",
    "we estimate the truncation error by examining the dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath11 to define the coupling constant @xmath12 as well as that on @xmath13 that defines the running charm quark mass @xmath14 appearing in the perturbative expansion .",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "the estimated error is slightly larger , because of different systematic effect as well as different error estimates .",
    "we also try to validate the lattice calculation by providing a comparison to the experimental data available for the vector channel through the @xmath6-ratio .",
    "it mainly serves as a test of the discretization effects , which is an important source of the systematic error for heavy quarks .",
    "we find that the continuum extrapolation is nearly flat , confirming that the discretization error for charm quark is well under control in our setup .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : time_moments ] we review the method of @xcite as well as the formulae to compare the temporal moments with the experimental data .",
    "some details of our lattice calculation are given in section  [ sec : lattice_details ] .",
    "lattice results for the vector current correlator and the comparison with the experimental data are given in section  [ sec : vector_moments ] , which is followed by corresponding results for pseudo - scalar correlator in section  [ sec : pseudoscalar_moments ] .",
    "the issues in the matching to perturbative results and its possible uncertainties are discussed in section  [ sec : matching ] , and results for charm quark mass and strong coupling constant are finally given in section  [ sec : determination ] .",
    "our conclusions are in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we calculate the pseudo - scalar and vector charmonium correlators with vanishing spatial momentum @xmath15 on the lattice .",
    "the currents are defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 with charm quark field @xmath18 on the lattice .",
    "given the factor @xmath19 , both @xmath20 are @xmath21 are dimensionless .",
    "the pseudo - scalar density operator @xmath22 is multiplied by a ( bare ) charm quark mass @xmath9 such that the correlator becomes renormalization scale invariant , while a possible renormalization factor @xmath23 for the vector current @xmath24 defined on the lattice is explicitly multiplied in ( [ eq : g^v ] ) .    we then construct the temporal moments as @xmath25 with @xmath26 an even integer equal to or larger than four . ( the correlator @xmath27 diverges as @xmath28 in the small - separation limit , and",
    "the lower moments contain ultraviolet divergences . ) on the lattice , the time coordinate @xmath29 runs between @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 the temporal extent of the lattice .    since the charmonium correlators @xmath20 and @xmath21 decay exponentially at large @xmath33 by the mass of the corresponding lowest energy states @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , the temporal moments ( [ eq : momentps ] ) and ( [ eq : momentv ] ) are sensitive only to the relatively short - range correlations .",
    "for an exponential function @xmath36 , where @xmath37 represents the mass of @xmath34 or @xmath35 , the largest contribution to the @xmath26-th moment comes from the region of @xmath38 . in the presence of excited state contributions ,",
    "the dominant region is slightly shifted to smaller @xmath33 s .",
    "figure  [ fig : window ] illustrates typical examples of the integrand @xmath39 to construct the @xmath26-th moments .",
    "lattice data at @xmath40 = 0.044  fm are taken and data for @xmath26 = 4 , 8 , and 12 are shown .",
    "the lowest moment , @xmath41 , receives a significant contribution from small @xmath33 range , @xmath42 12 , where the discretization effect could be substantial . for higher moments",
    "@xmath26 = 8 and 12 , the sum is not affected much by the small @xmath33 range .",
    "the vector correlator and its moments may be related to those in the continuum theory and to the experimental data .",
    "the vacuum polarization function @xmath43 is defined through @xmath44 derivatives of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath45 , @xmath46 may be related to the experimental data for the @xmath2 process , _ i.e. _ the @xmath6-ratio @xmath47 , as @xmath48 here @xmath49 stands for the electromagnetic charge of charm quark .",
    "the lower end of the integral @xmath50 should be set below the @xmath35 mass .",
    "the reference scale @xmath51 is arbitrary but is often taken at @xmath52 . using this notation",
    "we may write the relation between the temporal moments on the lattice and the observable as @xmath53 a direct comparison of the lattice results with the experimental values for @xmath54 ( or their phenomenological estimates ) is given in section  [ sec : vector_moments ] .",
    "the phenomenological estimates of @xmath54 can be found in @xcite .    for the pseudo - scalar density correlator @xmath55",
    "there is no such experimental information available , while the relation between the temporal moments and the derivatives of the vacuum polarization function may be written as @xmath56 with @xmath57 analogously defined as in ( [ eq : g_n ] ) .",

    "since the perturbative part of the method is common , a part of the error may be correlated among us .    among various sources of the systematic error ,",
    "the dominant one is the truncation of perturbative expansion , which is currently known up to @xmath66 . in order to improve the precision on @xmath0",
