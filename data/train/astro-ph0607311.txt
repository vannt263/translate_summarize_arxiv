    "in recent years there has been increasing evidence that the growth of supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies is closely linked to nuclear star formation and the formation of spheroids ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tight correlation between the black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion @xcite , as well as the weaker correlation between black hole mass and spheroid mass @xcite , indicate that the fuelling of the central black hole must be accompanied by spheroid growth .",
    "although part of the spheroid growth may result from mergers of stellar disks ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , star formation in the central regions of the galaxy is also expected to contribute to the overall growth of the bulge @xcite .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are found in galaxies where black holes are growing through the accretion of surrounding gas .",
    "the gas is also likely to be associated with the nuclear star formation . by measuring the element abundances of the gas surrounding the agn we obtain an indirect measurement of the star formation history of the host galaxy .",
    "if most of the gas has been converted into stars before the agn becomes visible , then the gas is likely to be of high metallicity .",
    "if , on the other hand , the agn is concurrent with or precedes the main episode of star formation in the bulge , low metallicity gas is likely to be found in some agn .",
    "there have been analyses of elemental abundances in agn for over two decades @xcite . in high-@xmath1 agn , this work has mainly focused on the broad emission lines to determine abundances . there have also been a number of studies that have used absorption line and narrow emission line diagnostics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . in nearby agn the narrow emission lines are readily observable , and are often the easiest method to determine metallicities as pioneered by @xcite .",
    "the results for both high and low redshift agn appear to show that most agn have solar to supersolar metallicities @xcite .",
    "although the results do depend on the detailed model assumptions ( see eg * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there does appear to be some consensus that the gas in agn is usually of high metallicity .",
    "the paucity of agn with sub - solar metallicities may be linked to the fact that agn in low mass galaxies appear to be very rare in the local universe .",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gas - phase metallicity is known to be strongly correlated with stellar mass @xcite .",
    "if agn are predominantly found in massive , bulge - dominated galaxies that have processed most of their gas into stars by the present epoch , it may not be too surprising that the inferred metallicities are almost always high .",
    "although these conditions may hold at the present epoch , it is interesting to speculate whether the host galaxies of agn might be considerably different at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , in the models of @xcite the typical gas fractions in agn hosts are expected to evolve from @xmath2 at the present day , to @xmath3 at @xmath4 and @xmath5 at @xmath6 . even if high redshift agn reside in massive galaxies , the gas - phase metallicities of their hosts",
    "might still be expected to be lower than at the present day .    in this paper",
    ", we explore these questions by using photoionization models to examine the effects that a variation in metallicity would have upon the narrow emission lines from an agn . we ask whether there are particular emission - line diagnostics that are most useful for identifying agn with low metallicity gas . using the models as a guide",
    ", we then search for low metallicity agn in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the sdss provides high quality spectra from which we can measure both the host galaxy and the emission - line properties of a very large sample of nearby agn , so it is an ideal database for searching for rare cases of low metallicity agn in the nearby universe .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results for searches for low metallicity agn at higher redshifts .",
    "the use of nebular emission lines produced in hii  regions to infer the gas - phase abundances of extragalactic objects has a long history ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "once understanding grew of the nuclear emission from agn it was not long before the use of emission lines as abundance diagnostics was extended to these objects ( eg * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is a good understanding of the ionizing sources in hii  regions ( the o & b stars ) and photoionization models to treat the physics of these regions are quite well - developed . as a result ,",
    "the correlation of emission line ratios with abundances in star - forming regions is reasonably well understood .",
    "recent papers by @xcite and @xcite have provided calibrated relationships between gas - phase oxygen abundance and combinations of strong emission lines that are observable at optical wavelengths .    for agn",
    "the situation is markedly different .",
    "the ionizing source is not as well understood , and has a much greater range in luminosity .",
    "the ionizing spectrum is also harder than that produced by stars , and shocks are also more likely to contribute to the ionization state . while recent theoretical models @xcite have helped clarify some of the ionization structure , considerable uncertainties still exist .",
    "many agn show both broad and narrow line emission , and the ionization conditions in both the broad and narrow emission line regions show strong variations between different agn .",
    "both the broad and the narrow emission lines can be used to estimate gas phase abundances .",
    "the broad line region ( blr ) samples the gas closer to the nucleus .",
    "however , these emission lines are only seen in type 1 agn , and the strong emission lines used for abundance analysis are only found in the uv . as a result , abundance analysis is restricted to high redshift agn or to objects with uv observations from space ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the narrow line regions ( nlr ) of agn are more readily observable .",
    "their greater spatial extent means they are less likely to be obscured .",
    "the nlr also produces strong optical emission lines from several species .",
    "the physics of the nlr is also simpler than that of the blr ; the physical conditions are in fact similar to hii  regions , so that many of the metallicity - sensitive emission line ratios that are routinely applied to star forming galaxies are also good diagnostics in the nlr . @xcite",
    "have calibrated several of these emission line ratios for nearby agn , using hii  region determined metallicities and photoionization models .",
    "the similarity between the nlr and the hii  regions in a galaxy also leads to ambiguities when estimating abundances . unless spatially - resolved observations can be obtained , it is often difficult to disentangle the contributions to the emission line spectrum from the nlr and from star - forming regions within the galaxy .",

    "in this particular diagram , the emission line galaxies are distributed in @xmath11-shaped morphology , with the star - forming galaxies located in the left branch and the agn in the right branch .",
    "the agn branch actually consists of two classes of object , the seyfert 2 galaxies and the liners @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the starforming galaxies along the horizontal [ nii]@xmath7/@xmath8  axis is strongly correlated with the metallicity within the starforming region and the mass of the galaxy ; both increase with increasing [ nii]/@xmath8 .",
    "the vertical axis of [ oiii]@xmath9/@xmath10  is associated with the average ionization state and temperature of the photoionized gas in the emission line galaxy .",
    "agn are offset from the star - forming galaxies on this axis because of their much harder ionizing spectrum .",
    "those objects which lie at the extremities of the agn branch are `` pure '' agn . as the contribution of star - formation to the emission line spectrum increases , the strength of [ oiii]/@xmath10  decreases .",
    "this agn - starburst mixing sequence culminates at the fulcrum of the @xmath11 , where starforming galaxies and agn dominated by starformation become indistinguishable .",
    "when we model nlr spectra , we consider only `` pure '' agn .",
    "we have run a series of narrow line region ( nlr ) models with a wide range in both metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "the models are based upon the dusty , radiation pressure dominated models of @xcite , but use a more realistic ionizing spectrum @xcite .",
    "while it is unknown whether low metallicity agn will contain dust , the observations of dust in high-@xmath1 objects indicates that such an assumption is not unreasonable @xcite .",
    "unlike previous work on nlr metallicity ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these models assume a more physical structure for the nlr clouds and concentrate upon the effects of low metallicity .",
    "as the models have been discussed in depth in previous papers , we only describe the relevant parameters and the changes that were made in order to address the issue of low metallicity agn . throughout this work",
    "we assume a fiducial value of @xmath12@xmath13  for the density as found in previous papers .",
    "the assumed abundances are based upon the solar abundance set of @xcite , which takes into account recent revisions of the solar abundances of several important elements like carbon and oxygen .",

    "when the total metallicity of a photoionized nebula decreases , there are several effects that cause changes in the final emission line spectrum . many of these effects have been described elsewhere ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dominant effect is the decreased abundance of an emitting species relative to hydrogen .",
    "this leads to weaker emission in lines such as nitrogen and oxygen relative to hydrogen recombination lines such as h@xmath14 and h@xmath15 .",
    "the line ratios relative to the other abundant primordial element , helium , also change in a similar way .",
    "this effect is not as strong , because helium also decreases with metallicity .    at metallicities above @xmath16",
    ", nitrogen is dominated by its secondary component .",
    "a decrease in metallicity down to this value results in a decrease of the strength of the nitrogen emission line relative to that of other metals .",
    "below @xmath17 , the primary component is dominant and the nitrogen tracks the behaviour of the other metal lines more closely .",
    "these trends are clearly seen in figure [ fig : nii ] , which presents the models on the classic @xcite ( bpt ) diagram of [ nii]@xmath18/@xmath8  versus [ oiii]@xmath9/@xmath10 .",
    "this diagram clearly reveals the strong decrease of the nitrogen emission lines relative to hydrogen as the metallicity decreases .    /@xmath8",
    "versus [ oiii]/@xmath10demonstrating the decrease of metal emission lines relative to hydrogen .",
    "this decrease is stronger for the nitrogen lines due to the secondary component in this element .",
    "model metallicities are as labelled , with the small numbers next to model indicating model run and associated ionization parameter as given in table [ tab : u ] .",
    "the background image shows the log scale density distribution of the sdss emission line sample , with seyfert galaxies lying in the right , blue colored branch .",
    "each branch has been scaled separately to emphasize the position of the seyfert galaxies . ]",
    "as metallicity decreases , the temperature of the nebula also increases .",
    "this is a result of the decrease in the efficiently cooling metal emission lines and the availability of more high energy photons to ionize hydrogen ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed explanations ) .",
    "higher nebular temperatures affect the strength of temperature sensitive emission lines , such as [ oiii]@xmath9 , which increases with temperature",
    ". line ratios like [ oiii]@xmath9/@xmath10  will thus decrease at a relatively slower rate with metallicity .",
    "this is also clear from the model presented in figure 2 . while temperature sensitive line ratios change with the metallicity of the gas , they are also strongly affected by the ionization state of the gas .",
    "this means that shocks and the varying contribution of star formation and agn to the ionization become important .",
    "another effect of lowering the metallicity is that the opacity of the gas is reduced , meaning a greater volume is needed to absorb all ionizing photons . in agn",
    "this effect causes noticeable differences because of the stronger contribution to the ionizing flux from x - rays , for which the hydrogen opacity is small .",
    "these x - rays give rise to the partially ionized region in nlrs , where important optical emission lines such as [ oi]6300  and [ sii]6713 + 31  are emitted .",
    "models with lower metallicity have larger partially ionized regions relative to the fully ionized region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our column density limited models ,",
    "the partially ionized region becomes truncated at low metallicities . as a result",
    ", we are not confident in our ability to use these models to calibrate some of the metallicity sensitive ratios commonly used in determining the abundances in star - forming galaxies , such as [ nii]/[sii ] and [ sii]/@xmath8  for use in the determination of agn abundances .",
    "generally , individual agn are best reproduced with a combination of models , varying not only the metallicity , but also the ionizing spectrum , the density , the incident flux or ionization parameter and even the geometry ( see eg * ? ? ?",
    "however when looking at large numbers of agn the best method is to look for trends or possible relationships between the line ratios and metallicity ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous agn modelling has found that agn as a group are best fit with models of around @xmath19 , or @xmath20o / h@xmath21 .",
    "thus any agn nlr found to have metallicities below solar could possibly be considered `` low metallicity '' .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , line ratios relative to hydrogen are good diagnostics for low metallicity agn .",
    "this is especially true for nitrogen with its secondary component as shown in figure [ fig : nii ] .",
    "the diagnostic of [ nii]@xmath7/@xmath8  has been used as one of the main metallicity indicators in agn due to its sensitivity and the strength of the lines @xcite . in general",
    ", low metallicity agn will lie to the left of the seyfert branch on the nii  bpt diagram .",
    "the decrease in the [ oiii]/@xmath10  ratio is not as strong because of the temperature sensitivity of this ratio .",
    "another possible diagram for metallicity diagnosis is the [ nii]@xmath7/[oii]@xmath22  versus [ oiii]@xmath9/ [ oii]@xmath22  diagram , shown in figure [ fig : oiioiii ] .",
    "this again relies upon nitrogen to separate the different metallicities , but also uses the temperature sensitive ratio [ oiii]/[oii ] as a secondary diagnostic .",
    "the [ nii]/[oii ] ratio will separate agn with lower nii  relative to oii .",
    "as nii  and oii  are both low ionization species , the ratio will only be weakly affected by the ionization or density conditions .",
    "in addition , star bursts and agn have similar [ nii]/[oii ] ratios for similar metallicities , so the abundance determination of an active galaxy is only slightly perturbed by any contribution from star formation .",
    "the main disadvantage of this ratio is that [ nii ] and [ oii ] are widely separated in wavelength and the ratio is hence much more sensitive to the effects of reddening .",
    "the [ oiii]/[oii ] ratio is similar to [ oiii]/@xmath10  as a temperature sensitive diagnostic in that is good in separating the seyferts from the star - forming galaxies",
    ". it also has the additional benefit of not being strongly sensitive to metallicity .",

    "the background image shows the distribution of the sdss emission line galaxies , with seyfert galaxies , colored blue , lying in the vertical branch and starbursts in the horizontal branch .",
    "each branch has been scaled separately to emphasize the position of the seyfert galaxies .",
    "the contribution by star formation to the agn decreases the [ oiii]/[oii ] ratio . ]",
    "both these diagnostic diagrams rely heavily on the [ nii ] line to estimate the metallicity .",
    "this means that the diagnostic is sensitive to abundance variations relative to solar within the nlr due to differing star formation histories .    at higher redshift ,",
    "the [ nii ] line is no longer observable , but uv diagnostics become useful @xcite .",
    "one possible diagram is shown in figure [ fig : uv ] , which plots the near  uv line ratios of [ oii]@xmath24  /[neiii]@xmath25  versus [ nev]@xmath26/[neiii]@xmath25 .",
    "this diagram relies upon the temperature sensitivity of the [ neiii ] line to distinguish different metallicities in the [ oii]/[neiii ] ratio .",
    "the [ nev]/[neiii ] ratio , while weakly dependent upon metallicity , is very sensitive to the ionizing spectrum and ionization state of the gas .",
    "thus this ratio provides a way of distinguishing star - forming galaxies , which have very little [ nev ] emission , from agn . as in figure",
    "[ fig : oiioiii ] , the strength of figure [ fig : uv ] lies in its use of strong lines and its ability to distinguish star forming galaxies from agn .",

    "some of the spectra of the other 40 agn candidates exhibit clear signatures of young stars as well as heii  @xmath65emission .",
    "others are dominated by older stars , and there are also a number of agn with strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "all objects have very weak [ nii]6584 and [ oi]6300 ( expected because of their low metallicities ) , but the strong [ oiii]5007 emission line and relatively strong [ sii ] 6716,31 doublet classify these objects as agn .",
    "one other point to note is the presence of the [ oiii]@xmath66  line in many of the spectra , indicative of the high gas temperatures in these objects , and also suggestive of low metallicities .     with a ) an example starburst galaxy and b ) ",
    "f ) low mass agn .",
    "each image shows the same area , with the bar in each frame indicating 5 .",
    "the image centre , as marked by the lines , is the position of the 3 sdss fibre centre .",
    "note that for most agn the 3 fibre encompasses a significant fraction of the host galaxy . ]    as a complement to the sdss fibre spectra , we also show images of the same sample in figure [ fig : lowmimg ] .",
    "the starforming galaxy has a distinctly different morphology compared to the agn , appearing diffuse and blue in color .",
    "the images of the low mass agn indicate that their host galaxies are faint and relatively compact .",
    "they tend to be red , with a disky or lenticular structure surrounding a relatively bright nucleus . for comparison , in figure [ fig : seyimg ]",
    "we show seyfert galaxies that fall in the main branch on line diagnostic diagrams and have a median redshift similar to the low mass sample of @xmath67 .",
    "the most obvious difference is their size .",
    "the spiral structure in the host galaxy is also much more evident .",
    "however in some respects the low mass and high mass agn are similar ; both have a bright red nucleus / bulge , and diffuse , blue outer disk .    , and all fall within the main seyfert branch on line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "markings the same as in figure [ fig : lowmimg ] . ]      in the previous section , we searched for low metallicity agn by looking for objects offset from the main agn branch .",
    "however the diagnostic diagrams of section [ sec : diag ] indicate that the lowest metallicity objects could actually lie within or even below the star - forming branch .    to explore this possibility , we selected from the sdss sample all objects with a signal - to - noise greater than 3 in @xmath8 , @xmath10  and [ oiii]@xmath9 , and looked at the metallicity sensitive line ratios such as [ sii]/@xmath8 [ neiii]/@xmath10  or [ nii]/[oii ] .",
    "the spectra , images and galaxy parameters of all objects with extremely low values of these ratios were examined .",
    "all of these objects appeared to be indistinguishable from low mass , low metallicity starburst galaxies .",
    "they all had blue colours and high equivalent width emission lines .",
    "none showed obvious signs of agn activity , such as the heii  @xmath65  emission line or [ nev]@xmath68  emission in the higher redshift objects .",
    "we found no clear evidence for extremely low metallicity agn .",
    "if such objects exist , they are either very rare they are indistinguishable from a low metallicity starburst galaxy .",
    "low metallicity agn appear to be very rare objects , at least locally .",
    "the sdss emission line galaxy sample only gives approximately 40 agn with a mass below @xmath69 and a significant detectable difference in their abundances relative to typical seyfert galaxies .",
    "the use of a low mass selection criterion is supported by the observations which reveal a correlation between mass and metal sensitive line ratios such as [ nii]/@xmath8 .",
    "an exact determination of a mass  metallicity relationship in agn is hindered by the difficulty of measuring with any accuracy the metallicity in the agn hosts .",
    "the 40 low metallicity agn selected out of the 23000 seyfert 2s in our original sdss sample appear to have metallicities around half that of typical agn .",
    "this leads to two questions : where are the low metallicity agn and why are there no agn with even lower metallicities ?",
    "we do lose some objects because we use the [ oii]@xmath70  line as a diagnostic , which means we miss low metallicity objects below @xmath71 .",
    "approximately 50 low mass agn lie below this redshift , but we estimate that only 10 would fall into the low metallicity category .",
    "another possibility is that low metallicity agn are `` hidden '' by strong star formation . as discussed in @xcite , a large fraction of low mass galaxies are experiencing bursts of starformation and show strong line emission .",
    "however figure 6 in @xcite demonstrates that it is not easy to hide a typical agn of high metallicity .",
    "these authors added agn of different [ oiii ] luminosities to low mass starburst galaxies and showed that at [ oiii ] luminosities above @xmath72 , all of them would have been detected .",
    "we have repeated the same analysis for low metallicity agn and we find very similar results .",
    "it is thus clear that low metallicity agn are rare in the local universe , what about at high redshift ?",
    "our emission - line diagnostics involve the rest - frame optical band , and the required spectroscopy is challenging at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite and @xcite have recently measured the @xmath10 , [ oiii]@xmath735007 , @xmath8 , and [ nii]@xmath736584 emission line fluxes in two small samples of galaxies at @xmath74 1.4 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "we have plotted the locations of these galaxies in figure [ fig : niilowm ] .",
    "nearly all the objects lie between the kauffmann and kewley classification lines .",
    "this region is dominated by composite objects , where both an agn and star formation contribute significantly to the emission - lines .",
    "however , the high redshift galaxies are displaced to significantly lower [ nii]/@xmath8ratios than typical sdss composite galaxies .",
    "the most natural interpretation of this is that these high redshift galaxies are indeed composite galaxies , but of lower metallicity than the typical sdss galaxies .",
    "similar objects comprise only a small fraction of the sdss sample , but in the region where most of the high redshift galaxies are located , bounded by the two classification curves and the main seyfert branch ( @xmath76oiii@xmath77/$]@xmath10@xmath78nii@xmath77/$]@xmath8@xmath79 ) , we still find about 500 sdss galaxies . modelling these as composites implies that the agn would produce 50 to 70% of the [ oiii]5007 flux , but only about 20% of the @xmath8  and @xmath10  flux . a definitive test of",
    "the presence of an agn would require the detection of the heii@xmath734686 or [ nev]@xmath733426 lines .",
    "unfortunately , the former line is expected to be weak ( a 20% agn contribution to h@xmath15 implies heii/@xmath10= 0.05 ) , while the latter line is not redshifted into the sdss spectral band for the great majority of objects .    while we can not definitively say that _ typical _ sdss galaxies with spectra similar to the high redshift galaxies have agn , there are indirect pieces of evidence that strongly suggest that this is the case . when compared with a sample of nearby pure star - forming galaxies ( all galaxies within @xmath80 dex of [ -0.55,0.10 ] on the nii  bpt diagram ) , we find that the host galaxies of these candidate low - metallicity composites differ in a way that is similar to what is found for the host galaxies of agn @xcite .",
    "they have on average significantly higher stellar masses ( @xmath81 dex ) , older stellar populations ( d4000 of 1.29 compared to 1.16 ) , redder colors ( @xmath82 greater in @xmath83 ) and weaker @xmath8  equivalent widths than the pure star forming galaxies .",
    "similar differences are found in their surface mass density , @xmath84 , concentration index and other galactic parameters .",
    "a comparison of the composites with objects just below the kauffmann classification curve shows similar , albeit weaker , differences .",
    "however within the composite region there are some galaxies that are likely to be pure starforming galaxies as they have strong @xmath8  equivalent widths and host properties that are similar to ordinary star - forming galaxies .",
    "the @xcite object at @xmath85[nii]/@xmath8@xmath86 is the clear exception to the previous objects .",
    "lying above both the kauffmann and kewley classification curves , it requires a much greater contribution by an agn to be offset from the star - forming branch due to its low metallicity.in our sdss agn selected sample , we have no low metallicity agn or composites with which to compare this object .",
    "if we select the few sdss objects that lie within the errors of the erb object , all are clear starbursting galaxies with indicators such as the neon emission lines and heii@xmath87  are so weak , if present at all , as to indicate that the contribution of an agn to the spectrum is negligible . thus this object is most likely to be a low metallicity starburst .",
    "we conclude that most of the high redshift galaxies in figure [ fig : niilowm ] are most likely to be composite objects with an agn .",
    "fortunately , the agn will have only a modest effect on the [ nii]/@xmath8  ratio used by @xcite and @xcite to measure the metallicity .",
    "we estimate that the agn contribution will increase [ nii]/@xmath8  by only about 0.1 to 0.2 dex , and hence cause the metallicity to be overestimated by less than 0.1 dex @xcite .",
    "if the @xcite and @xcite galaxies are composite agn / starforming galaxies , this may imply that low metallicity agn are more common at high redshifts .",
    "we note , however , that investigations of the metallicities of qsos at redshifts greater than 1 using both broad and narrow emission lines all appear to show solar to supersolar metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the scarcity of low metallicity agn locally is very suggestive .",
    "the results indicate that it is unlikely for a strong agn to be found in a galaxy whose mass is less than @xmath88 , or whose metallicity is less than solar .",
    "it is not clear whether this indicates that black holes only form in galaxies above some mass threshhold .",
    "there is considerable evidence that high luminosity agn are hosted by galaxies with young stellar populations and strong post - burst features @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the agn must be preceded by strong star formation and this may also explain the high metallicities in the nlr gas .",
    "further studies of agn in low mass hosts ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at early cosmological epochs when the mean star formation rate and gas densities were much higher will shed more light on these questions .",
