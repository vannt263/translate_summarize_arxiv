    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss;@xcite ) will digitally map 10,000 square degrees of the northern galactic cap ( hereafter , the main survey ) , and a smaller area ( @xmath5 ) in the southern galactic cap ( hereafter , the southern survey ) .",
    "the imaging survey is done in five broad bands , @xmath0 @xcite , that were specially designed for the survey .",
    "in addition to the imaging data produced by a large ccd mosaic camera @xcite , the sdss will conduct a spectroscopic survey of objects selected from the catalogs derived from the processed images with the goal of obtaining spectra of approximately one million galaxies and one hundred thousand quasars .",
    "a detailed description of the overall target selection algorithm for all classes of spectroscopic targets can be found in @xcite ; in this paper we describe the spectroscopic target selection algorithm for the sdss quasar survey .",
    "the primary sdss quasar science goals are defined by the two `` key projects '' that will be addressed with the final quasar sample .",
    "the key projects are 1 ) the evolution of the quasar luminosity function and 2 ) the spatial clustering of quasars as a function of redshift .",
    "these studies require the assembly of a large sample of quasars covering a broad range of redshift and chosen with well - defined , uniform selection criteria .",
    "the sdss quasar survey will increase the number of known quasars by a factor of 100 over previous surveys such as the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; @xcite ) , which was until recently the largest complete quasar survey . in so doing , the sdss quasar survey will also be approximately four times the size of the concurrent 2df qso redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the sdss quasar sample has a high completeness fraction from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; the sample also has high - quality five - color photometry and high signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution .",
    "the selection of quasars from multi - color imaging data was pioneered by @xcite and has continued through the years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; a review of the history of surveys for high - redshift quasars is given by @xcite .",
    "the approach we adopt when selecting quasars from the imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey is similar to previous studies .",
    "however , certain characteristics of the sdss ( such as the novel filter system , matching to radio sources , etc .",
    ", along with the quality and quantity of the data ) make the selection of sdss quasars unique .",
    "these features of the survey require a detailed description of the algorithm that selects quasar candidates for follow - up spectroscopy , hereafter the sdss quasar target selection algorithm .",
    "our quasar target selection algorithm seeks to explore all the regions of color space that quasars are known to occupy , avoid most regions of color space where the quasar density is much lower than the density of contaminants , and to explore relatively uncharted regions of color space to the extent possible given the available number of spectroscopic fibers . as a result of our exploration of less populated regions of color space ,",
    "our algorithm is open to serendipitous discovery of quasars with unusual colors and thus unusual properties .",
    "our formal science requirements are to recover 90% or more of previously known quasars , while maintaining an efficiency in excess of 65% , where the efficiency is given by the ratio of true quasars to quasar candidates .",
    "the balance between completeness and efficiency is a delicate one ; with so many more stars than quasars in the data , improvements in efficiency by rejecting objects in regions of color space in which both stars and quasars lie will necessarily cut back on completeness .",
    "in addition , unlike many quasar surveys , it is important to realize that the sdss quasar target selection algorithm was finalized in advance of collecting most of the imaging data .",
    "the algorithm also was required to be completely automated and operate on a single object at a time , independently of all other objects .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the sdss filters allows for the selection of quasars from @xmath8 to beyond a redshift of 6 .",
    "the automated algorithm described herein requires that there be flux in at least two bands , which imposes an upper limit to the redshift of @xmath9 ( based on the minimum transmission between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 filter curves at @xmath12 straddled by lyman-@xmath13 emission ) .",
    "it is possible to use sdss imaging data to discover quasars with even larger redshifts by investigating objects that are detected in the @xmath11 filter only .",
    "such a search is beyond the capability of the survey proper as the efficiency of the automated selection for objects detected only in the @xmath11-band is much too low ; searches for the very highest redshift quasars require spectroscopy outside of normal sdss operations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the low - redshift end",
    ", the design of the @xmath14 filter and the location of the gap between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 filters were chosen to emphasize the difference between objects with power - law spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , such as quasars at @xmath16 , and objects that are strongly affected by the balmer decrement , particularly a stars , which are historically the prime contaminants in multi - color surveys for low - redshift quasars .",
    "the filter curves are described in @xcite with modifications as described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , the quasar target selection code works as follows .",
    "1 ) objects with spurious and/or problematic fluxes in the imaging data are rejected .",
    "2 ) point source matches to first radio sources are preferentially targeted without reference to their colors .",
    "3 ) the sources remaining after the first step are compared to the distribution of normal stars and galaxies in two distinct 3d color spaces , one nominally for low - redshift quasar candidates ( based on the @xmath17 colors ) , and one nominally for high redshift quasar candidates ( based on the @xmath18 colors ) .",
    "stars in particular follow a one - dimensional locus in the four - dimensional sdss color space , which we model explicitly ( and keep fixed for the duration of the survey ) . those objects that are discernible outliers from the regions of color space populated by stars and non - active galaxies are selected for spectroscopic follow - up if they meet all of the other criteria , including the magnitude cuts .",
    "objects meeting any of the selection requirements have one or more target flags set , see table  [ tab : tab1 ] .    during the color selection process",
    "we draw no specific line between quasars and their less luminous cousins , seyfert galaxy nuclei ; objects which have the colors of low - redshift agn are targeted even if they are resolved .",
    "this policy is in contrast to some other surveys for quasars ; it is not unusual for extended objects to be rejected , which has the effect of imposing a lower limit to the redshift distribution of the survey . throughout this paper , we will , in fact , use the word `` quasar '' where we often mean `` agn '' .",
    "the complete sdss data set is needed to ultimately determine if the traditional distinction between quasars and seyfert galaxy nuclei is warranted .    once quasar candidates have been identified , we obtain spectra of each candidate using the sdss fiber - fed spectrographs .",
    "each @xmath19 diameter sdss spectroscopic plate holds 640 fibers , of which an average of 80 are assigned to quasar candidates .",
    "quasar candidates are allocated approximately 18 fibers per square degree .",
    "plate overlaps account for the difference between 18 objects per square degree and 80 objects per plate ( which have an area of @xmath20 square degrees ) . given this constraint on density and the requirements on completeness and efficiency , we target color - selected quasar candidates to a galactic - extinction corrected @xmath21 magnitude of @xmath22 and not in the notation of the filters ( @xmath0 ) in order to indicate that the final calibration to the formal @xmath0 system is not yet complete .",
    "see the discussion in @xcite . ] .",
    "we also identify radio - selected quasar candidates by matching unresolved sdss point sources to first radio sources @xcite to the same magnitude limit .",
    "finally , since the density of high - redshift quasars ( @xmath3 ) is relatively low and since the sdss spectrographs are capable of obtaining redshifts of quasars that are much fainter than @xmath23 , we use @xmath4 as the magnitude limit for high - redshift quasar candidates .",
    "section  [ sec : commissioning ] discusses the role of the commissioning period to the development of the quasar target selection algorithm .",
    "section  [ sec : selection ] presents the detailed selection criteria .",
    "section  [ sec : diagnostics ] contains the diagnostic analysis used to finalize the algorithm . in   [ sec : discussion ] and   [ sec : conclusions ] , we present discussion and conclusions , respectively .",
    "appendix  [ sec : appendixa ] describes the creation of the stellar locus that we use to define outliers , whereas appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] discusses the algorithm by which outliers from this locus are selected .",
    "it is well - known in the astronomical community that `` first light '' for any new telescope is not synonymous with the commencement of full science operations .",
    "the sdss collaboration recognized from the beginning that a testing period would be needed prior to the survey proper  particularly for the development of the final quasar target selection algorithm .",
    "the initial pre - commissioning algorithm rejected objects with colors consistent with the stellar locus , while selecting regions of color - space that were known to harbor quasars or that had a sufficiently low density of sources that they could be explored efficiently .",
    "as this preliminary approach was inadequate for the main survey , this algorithm deliberately erred on the side on inclusiveness , so that we could explore the boundaries of the quasar locus in color and determine the nature of contaminants .",
    "the primary goals of the commissioning period were to refine this algorithm to 1 ) meet the survey requirements that the quasar sample be at least 90% complete and 65% efficient , and 2 ) establish the magnitude limits needed to meet the density requirements .",
    "although the results of previous quasars surveys reveal approximately what regions of color space quasars inhabit and where their contaminants are in color space , prior to commissioning we did not have all of the knowledge that was needed to achieve our goals .",
    "for example , we did not know the intrinsic spread in quasar spectral indices , which translates to a lack of knowledge of the intrinsic spread in quasar colors . compounding",
    "this problem is that , prior to the sdss , no large samples of quasars with photometric accuracy comparable to the sdss existed ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; _ all _ of the large area spectroscopic surveys for quasars prior to the sdss have been based on magnitudes measured from photographic plates .",
    "one of our primary concerns during the commissioning period was that as stellar populations change between halo and disk , the detailed position and width of the stellar locus will be a function of direction on the sky .",
    "as the stellar locus used by the code is fixed by definition , any shift of the stellar locus as a function of position on the sky would have the effect of greatly worsening the target selection efficiency in certain areas of sky .",
    "we tested this possibility by examining the stellar locus in the early data release @xcite runs 752 and 756 , each of which extend over six hours of right ascension on the celestial equator ; they extend from low galactic latitudes ( @xmath24 ) to high ( @xmath25 ) over a large range of galactic longitudes ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we used a simplified version of the stellar locus code described in @xcite to fit line segments to various parts of the stellar locus , and examined its parameters as a function of position on the sky .",
    "we found that the position of the locus shows a root - mean - square scatter of 0.015 mag in color , consistent with our errors on absolute photometric calibration .",
    "no systematic trend was seen with position on the sky .",
    "similarly , the effective width of the locus was essentially constant .",
    "there was a noticeable effect that the blue end of the stellar locus is a function of magnitude as low metallicity halo blue horizontal branch stars enter the sample in large numbers fainter than @xmath27 .",
    "however , we found empirically that there is no substantial change in the efficiency of quasar target selection either as a function of magnitude or as a function of position on the sky .",
    "based on the knowledge gained during the commissioning period and the results of the first 66 plates of data ( 2555 quasars ) , we refined the algorithm to the point where it was deemed to be sufficiently robust for regular survey operations .",
    "the target selection algorithms , including the quasar module , were `` frozen '' on 2000",
    "november 3 , such that all imaging runs processed after this date and all spectroscopic plates tiled after this date were appropriate , in principle , for the creation of statistical samples of quasars .",
    "however , additional observations revealed that the completeness of the algorithm at @xmath28 and @xmath29 was unacceptably low  a fact that was only realized after a sufficient number of @xmath30 objects had been discovered to realize the deficit .",
    "in addition , changes to the photometric pipeline which processes the imaging data ( photo ; @xcite ) , small shifts in the photometric solutions and better simulated quasar photometry dictated that further refinements to the code were necessary .",
    "the changes to the code were based upon a `` testbed '' of imaging data from sdss runs 756 , 1035 , 1043 , 1752 , 1755 and part of run 752 , in addition to all of the spectra obtained in these areas prior to 2001 july 20 .",
    "( see @xcite for information on the sdss runs . )",
    "these changes were approved on 2001 august 24 ; all spectra taken with this final version of the code thus constitute the basis for the statistical sample of sdss quasars .",
    "this discussion of the sdss quasar target selection algorithm is ordered largely in the way that events occur . a flowchart that describes the selection process",
    "is given in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ; the order of the flowchart is slightly different from that of the code for the sake of clarity .",
    "note that each object is considered individually and that more than one target selection flag can be set for each object .",
    "the target selection flags that are set by this algorithm are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] ; see @xcite , particularly table  27 , for additional information on the all of the target selection flags .",
    "we start our description of the target selection algorithm with a discussion of the input data , both the photometry (   [ sec : input - photometry ] ) and flags indicating possible problems (   [ sec : flags ] ) .",
    "point sources that have counterparts in the first survey are targeted , as described in ",
    "[ sec : first ] , but the heart of the target selection algorithm is the selection of outliers from the stellar locus in color - color space , as described in   [ sec : colorselect ] .",
    "this algorithm takes into account the estimated magnitude errors to determine whether it lies within the stellar locus ( appendix  b ) . finally , this algorithm is supplemented by the inclusion and exclusion of several special regions in color space , as described in   [ sec : hardcuts ] .",
    "the measured sdss fluxes are converted into asinh magnitudes @xcite ; these magnitudes are more robust for color selection at low flux levels than are traditional logarithmic magnitudes @xcite .",
    "this affects the handling of limiting magnitudes , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : preprocess ] . for objects that are detected at more than @xmath31 ,",
    "asinh magnitudes differ from logarithmic magnitudes by less than 1% .    since we allow extended objects to be selected by the algorithm , but only in specific regions of color space , the algorithm needs to distinguish between extended and point sources . in the context of our algorithm ,",
    "extended sources are defined as follows . each two - dimensional image of each object in the sdss is fit with a series of models , including the locally determined point spread function ( psf ) , along with exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles of arbitrary scale size , axis ratio , and orientation ( convolved with the psf ) .",
    "an extended object is defined as an object with substantial flux on scales beyond the psf . with this in mind , star - galaxy separation is based on the difference between the psf and either the exponential or the de vaucouleurs magnitude ( whichever has a larger likelihood ) in each band ; an object is classified as extended in that band if this difference is greater than 0.145 mag .",
    "the final , overall , morphology classification is determined by summing the counts in all five bands and applying the same criterion as for any single band , see   4.4.6 of @xcite for more details . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the star - galaxy separation is reliable at least to @xmath32  typically much fainter than the limit explored by quasar target selection .",
    "all magnitudes used within the quasar target selection algorithm ( and throughout this paper ) are psf magnitudes , as opposed to fiber magnitudes or galaxy model magnitudes ; see   4.4.5 of @xcite for more details . for point sources ,",
    "psf magnitudes yield the most accurate color information ; for extended sources the colors will be less diluted by starlight than will model , fiber or petrosian magnitudes .",
    "finally , the magnitudes used by the quasar target selection algorithm have been corrected for galactic reddening according to @xcite .",
    "these have not been updated for the recently discovered shifts of the effective wavelengths of the sdss filter curves ( compare @xcite with @xcite ) , which causes systematic errors of 7% of the reddening correction or less  negligible for the high - latitude regions of sky covered by sdss .      during the process of extracting objects from the images and measuring their photometric properties ,",
    "photo sets a number of flags ( which can be good or bad ) for each detected object , some of these flags indicate objects whose photometry ( and therefore , colors ) may be problematic ( e.g. , blending of close pairs of objects , objects too close to the edge of the frame , objects affected by a cosmic ray hit , etc . ) .",
    "some flags indicate problems that are sufficiently serious that the object in question should not be targeted for spectroscopy under any circumstances ; these will be referred to as `` fatal '' errors .",
    "other flags are important , but do not indicate a problem that is serious enough to reject an object outright ; these are referred to as `` non - fatal '' errors .",
    "objects with non - fatal errors are considered by the first targeting algorithm (   [ sec : first ] ) , but not by the color selection algorithm .",
    "a list of all of the photo flags used _ directly _ by the quasar module of the target selection algorithm are given in table  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "for more details regarding all of the photo flags , see table  9 of @xcite .",
    "fatal errors include objects flagged as bright , saturated , edge , or blended in any band .",
    "bright objects duplicate entries of sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio objects .",
    "the photometry of saturated objects is clearly not to be trusted .",
    "edge objects lie sufficiently close to the edge of a frame that their photometry is unreliable .",
    "blended objects have several peaks ; they are deblended into children ( flagged as child , each of which _ are _ considered by the algorithm ) .",
    "objects are further required to have the status flag ok_scanline set , which avoids duplicate entries for regions of overlap between two adjacent scans .",
    "an additional constraint is that the morphology , objc_type , must be either `` 3 '' or `` 6 '' ( galaxy and stellar , respectively ; see the discussion in   [",
    "sec : input - photometry ] ) , since the other types are all error codes .",
    "objects are required to be detected at 5@xmath33 in at least one of the five bands ; objects whose magnitude errors are larger than @xmath34 in all five bands are rejected .",
    "at one point we had considered explicitly rejecting objects that photo deemed to be moving ( i.e. , asteroids ) .",
    "main - belt asteroids move several arcseconds over the roughly five minutes between imaging in @xmath35 and @xmath15 .",
    "photo recognizes such moving objects explicitly , and does proper photometry of them @xcite .",
    "as asteroids have colors very close to that of the sun , they lie in the stellar locus ; thus we have not found the need to reject them explicitly .",
    "some of the flags in the database are more subtle .",
    "we have identified a number of such flags ( or combinations thereof ) that effect quasar target selection .",
    "some objects have flags that indicate that they have colors that are unreliable ; these objects are not allowed to be targeted via the color - selection criteria , but radio sources associated with such objects can be targeted .",
    "the most common problem is associated with poor deblends of complex objects ; the following are empirical combinations of flags that allow us to reject essentially all such problematic cases .",
    "in particular , we flag as non - fatal errors deblended children with peakcenter , notchecked , or deblend_nopeak set in any band  if they are brighter than 23 mag in the same band , and have an error in that band of less than 0.12 mag .",
    "similarly , children with photometric errors greater than 1.0 mag are flagged as non - fatal errors , as are children with photometric errors greater than 0.25 in a detected band but that are _ not _ deblend_nopeak .",
    "objects with interp_center set have a cosmic ray or bad column within 3 pixels of their center , which has been interpolated over ; empirically , we find that many false quasar candidates are found with @xmath36 and this flag set , so we flag all such objects as non - fatal errors .",
    "the errors of fainter detected objects with interp_center set are occasionally underestimated , so we increase the photometric errors by @xmath37 mag in that band in quadrature . finally , there are a few bad columns that are not properly interpolated over by the photometric pipeline , and so we reject objects in ccd columns 1383 - 1387 and 1452 - 1460 in dewar 2 .",
    "we also rejected ccd columns 1019 - 1031 in dewar 5 for imaging runs prior to run 1635 ; starting with run 1635 this defect was corrected in the ccd electronics .",
    "for a few imaging runs , one of the two read - out amplifiers on the @xmath14 ccd in dewar 3 was not operating ; as a result , half of the dewar 3 @xmath14 images were completely blank . both non - detections in @xmath14 and objects lying on the amplifier split cause problems for the quasar target selection code . in both cases the objects will be flagged as binned1 , binned2 , or binned4 by photo ; objects on the edge are further flagged as local_edge and will have erroneous @xmath14-band photometry , whereas objects that are entirely in the blank region have notchecked_center set .    for those objects lying in the undetected region or on the edge we increase the magnitude error in the problematic band by a full 10 mag .",
    "this increase in error causes nearly all of the objects affected by this problem to be considered as being consistent with the stellar locus and thus not selected as a quasar candidate ( see   [ sec : colorselect ] ) .",
    "this solution is a general one that can account for problems not only in the @xmath14 , but also in the other filters should future problems arise .",
    "however , sufficiently blue objects in @xmath38 can still be false outliers from the stellar locus regardless of their @xmath14-band fluxes . thus the above solution is not sufficient for objects with very blue @xmath38 colors in the @xmath17 color cube (   [ sec : ugri ] ) . as a result",
    ", we explicitly reject objects that are fully or partially in a region of a ccd with a bad amplifier during the @xmath17 color selection process .",
    "in addition , we expand the area of color space where white dwarfs are rejected ( see   [ sec : exclusion ] ) to include any @xmath39 color .",
    "fortunately , the failure of the @xmath14 ccd amplifier in dewar 3 was limited to a few imaging runs and the problem has been repaired .",
    "nevertheless , the software patch remains in the algorithm should the problem recur in the future .",
    "the sdss catalog is matched against the first catalog of radio sources @xcite ; stellar objects ( objc_type @xmath40 ) with @xmath41 that also have radio counterparts are selected by setting the target flag qso_first_cap .",
    "an sdss object is considered to be a match to a first object if the first and sdss positions agree to within @xmath42 ( the relative astrometry of the two surveys is excellent , as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "explicit _ morphology criteria are applied to the first data ; however , no attempt is made to match sdss sources to double - lobed first sources , for which the optical position would be expected to be located on the line between the two radio sources .",
    "this exclusion introduces a bias in the sdss radio quasar sample against steep - spectrum , lobe - dominated quasars , yet it simplifies the matching process considerably and keeps contamination to a minimum . extended optical sources are excluded from the radio selection ( though not the color selection ) , since these are mostly moderate redshift galaxies .",
    "since stars far outnumber quasars to the sdss magnitude limits , the first step to selecting quasars in an efficient manner is to remove from consideration the region inhabited by stars .",
    "the colors of ordinary stars occupy a continuous , almost one - dimensional region in @xmath43 color - color - color - color space @xcite , where temperature is the primary parameter that determines position along the length of the `` locus '' of stars .",
    "whereas stars have a spectrum that is roughly blackbody in shape , quasars have spectra that are characterized by featureless blue continua and strong emission lines , causing quasars to have colors quite different from those of stars . as a result of their distinct colors ,",
    "quasar candidates can be identified as outliers from the stellar locus .",
    "we define a region of multicolor space which contains this locus of stars .",
    "this stellar locus does not include _ all _ types of stars , but rather is limited to ordinary f to m stars that dominate the stellar density in the galaxy ( at high latitude ) .",
    "the quasar target selection algorithm models this stellar locus , following @xcite , as a two - dimensional ribbon with an elliptical cross - section ( see appendix a for details ) . in practice ,",
    "our definition of the stellar locus is done in two stages , once for the @xmath44 color cube ( hereafter @xmath17 ) , and once for the @xmath45 color cube ( hereafter @xmath18 ) . splitting 4d color space into 3d color spaces was a choice made to simplify the code : there is no physical basis for this separation . the application of this code to select stellar locus outliers is described in detail in appendix b , and is briefly outlined below .",
    "the algorithm chooses objects that lie more than @xmath46 from the stellar locus , where the quantity @xmath47 is determined from the errors of the object in question and the width of the stellar locus at the nearest point .",
    "this procedure gives a well - defined , reproducible color - cut for quasar target selection ( as we define the stellar locus a priori , and do not dynamically adjust it as the survey progresses ) , and as we will see , allows us to meet our completeness and efficiency goals .",
    "the overall shape of the featureless continua of quasars is well approximated by a power - law @xcite , although the continuum need not be a power - law physically . since a redshifted power - law remains a power - law with the same spectral index ,",
    "quasar colors are only a weak function of redshift for @xmath48 , as emission - lines move in and out of the filters @xcite .",
    "however , quasar spectra deviate dramatically from power - laws at rest wavelengths below 1216 , where the lyman-@xmath13 forest systematically absorbs light from the quasar @xcite ; the net effect is that quasars become increasingly redder with redshift as the lyman-@xmath13 forest moves through the filter set .",
    "modeling of this effect by @xcite and empirical evidence from @xcite shows that , in the sdss filters , the quasar locus is well - separated from the stellar locus for both relatively low ( @xmath49 ) and relatively high ( @xmath50 ) redshifts , but that at intermediate redshifts , quasars have broad - band sdss colors that are often indistinguishable from early f and late a stars .",
    "we handle the region of color space in which intermediate redshift quasars lie separately , as described in   [ sec : hardcuts ] .",
    "before color selection begins , we first remove from consideration those objects with non - fatal errors , since their colors may be suspect .",
    "since we allow such objects to be selected by the first algorithm , we can statistically correct for their loss during color selection .",
    "next , to account for systematic errors in the photometric calibration , we add 0.0075 mag in quadrature to the estimated psf magnitude errors from photo . as discussed above , stellar outliers are defined as those more than @xmath46 from the stellar locus , so this process in effect allows for 0.03 mag calibration errors .",
    "furthermore , since we correct the magnitudes for galactic reddening according to the reddening map of @xcite , we also add to the errors ( in quadrature ) 15% of the reddening values , which is their estimate of the systematic errors in this reddening map .",
    "finally , objects at or below the @xmath51 detection limit in any band are treated by the outlier algorithm somewhat differently from objects that are detected in all five bands ( see appendix  b ) .",
    "the non - linear relationship between count errors and magnitude errors requires special treatment in determining what `` @xmath46 from the stellar locus '' means . for such objects , we determine the final magnitudes by converting the asinh magnitude to counts , adding 4 times the estimated error in counts , and converting back to asinh magnitude .",
    "these new asinh magnitudes ( and the resulting colors ) are used to test whether an object is consistent with being in the stellar locus .      with these preprocessing steps completed ,",
    "the actual color outlier selection begins .",
    "the colors of each object are examined in turn , and asked whether they are consistent with lying within either the @xmath17 or @xmath18 stellar loci , incorporating the photometric errors .",
    "the details of this process are described in appendix  b. in short , quasar candidates are chosen to be those objects which lie more than @xmath46 from either stellar locus .",
    "outliers from the @xmath17 color - cube have the quasar target selection flag qso_cap set , whereas outliers from the @xmath18 color - cube are flagged as qso_hiz ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "objects which are located in regions of color space where the contamination rate is expected to be high are flagged as qso_reject and are not targeted even if they are outliers from either of the stellar loci ( see   [ sec : hardcuts ] ) .",
    "quasar target selection is limited to objects fainter than @xmath52 ; the wings of the spectra of the brighter objects tend to overwhelm the spectra of objects in adjacent fibers as seen on the ccd detector of the sdss spectrographs .",
    "the @xmath17-selected objects are targeted to @xmath23 , and the @xmath18-selected objects are targeted to @xmath4 , but our photometry is sufficiently accurate both brighter and fainter than these limits that outliers from the stellar locus are of interest for follow - up studies .",
    "we therefore mark such objects outside these magnitude limits as qso_mag_outlier ; these objects are not targeted for spectroscopy under routine operations .      in @xmath17 color - space , objects that have 1 ) survived the flag checks , 2 )",
    "are outliers from the stellar locus ( see appendix a ) , and 3 ) are not in the exclusion boxes mentioned below (   [ sec : exclusion ] ) are selected as quasar candidates to a magnitude limit of @xmath53 .",
    "as described in appendix b , the primary selection is accomplished by convolving the errors of a new object with the @xmath46 @xmath17 stellar locus depicted by the red outlines in figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] , thereby creating a 3d error surface surrounding the stellar locus .",
    "if the colors of the object are inside this error region , then the object is deemed to be consistent with the stellar locus and the object is not selected . if the object is outside of this surface , it is considered to be a good quasar candidate by virtue of its status as an outlier from the stellar locus .",
    "the parameters for the @xmath17 stellar locus are given in table  [ tab : tab3 ] ; see also appendix  a. since the stellar locus that we use is set a priori and is not determined from the sdss data for each new run , the cuts in color space are uniform over the survey .",
    "note also that the boundary of the stellar locus is determined from a series of cylinders , and no attempt is made to make this boundary smooth where the cylinders overlap .    during the @xmath17 color selection process , both extended and point source objects are targeted as quasar candidates ; we do not explicitly differentiate between quasars and their lower - luminosity cousins that are typically extended .",
    "note that by using psf magnitudes throughout , we isolate the colors of any point - like components of galaxies with active nuclei . however , not all extended objects are allowed to be selected  just those that have colors that are far from the colors of the main galaxy distribution and that are consistent with the colors of agn . at one point",
    "we had considered fitting an empirical `` galaxy locus '' much like our stellar locus however , in practice , we found it easier to make some simple color cuts to keep from targeting too many normal galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we show the color - color and color - magnitude distribution of stars and galaxies that are brighter than @xmath53 .",
    "these objects are all of the point and extended sources in the testbed data ( see   [ sec : commissioning ] ) that do not have fatal or non - fatal errors according to the quasar target selection algorithm and are otherwise good quasar candidates .",
    "black points and contours show unresolved sources , orange points and contours show the extended sources . that the star / galaxy separation algorithm is not perfect is obvious from the number of extended sources along the branch of late - type stars ( @xmath54 ) , a color that low - redshift galaxies rarely have @xcite .",
    "even so , the separation is quite good .",
    "normal galaxy colors are clearly distinct from the stellar locus ; they are very concentrated in @xmath55 color space , they extend redward of the stellar locus in @xmath56 color space , and they occupy roughly the space expected from a superposition of stars in @xmath57 color space .",
    "as figure  [ fig : fig4 ] makes clear , galaxies can be outliers from the stellar locus , so we use two color cuts to reject extended objects unlikely to harbor an active nucleus .",
    "first , extended objects that are detected in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , that have errors less than @xmath34  mag in each band , and that have @xmath58 are rejected .",
    "quasars with colors redder than @xmath58 have redshifts that are sufficiently large ( @xmath59 ) that they should not be resolved .",
    "this cut misses the extension of the galaxy locus to somewhat bluer @xmath60 colors , and thus we apply a second cut , rejecting extended objects with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( in the notation of @xcite ; also see appendix a ) .",
    "this second cut effectively removes all extended objects that are `` above '' and to the `` left '' of the stellar locus in the @xmath63 color - color diagrams .",
    "the blue edge of this cut is illustrated by the vectors drawn perpendicular to the stellar locus at the blue tip of the locus in the @xmath57 and @xmath56 plots in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] and also figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "note that the axes in these plots have different scales , which causes the vector to appear as if it were not perpendicular to the long direction of the stellar locus .",
    "objects that meet all of the above criteria are selected for follow - up spectroscopy by setting the qso_cap bit in their target selection flag ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .      in a manner equivalent to that for the @xmath17 color - cube , outliers from the stellar locus in the @xmath18 color - cube with @xmath64",
    "are targeted for follow - up spectroscopy as quasar candidates .",
    "these objects will be flagged as qso_hiz .",
    "the @xmath46 intrinsic width of the @xmath18 stellar locus is given by the red outlines in figures  [ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] ; the parameters for the @xmath18 stellar locus are given in table  [ tab : tab4 ] , see also appendices a and b. targeted objects in the @xmath18 color - cube must be classified as stellar , as they will lie at redshifts above @xmath28 , and the majority of quasars with @xmath65 are classified as stellar at the resolution of the sdss .",
    "note that this means that we will be biased against gravitational lenses with @xmath3 ; however , we can not afford the level of contamination that would accompany the inclusion of very red , extended sources .",
    "the purpose of the @xmath18 selection is specifically to select high - redshift quasars .",
    "however , some low - redshift quasars are outliers from the @xmath18 stellar locus as well ; given that we target the @xmath18 color - cube 1.1 mag fainter than the @xmath17 color - cube , the qso_hiz targets could be dominated by low - redshift quasars . to avoid this problem ,",
    "objects are _ not _ selected as quasar candidates in the @xmath18 color - cube when the following conditions are met : @xmath66 these cuts are empirically defined to remove faint , low - redshift quasars in addition to some faint objects that are clearly in the stellar locus but that the automated code fails to exclude .    we have found that there are objects selected as high - redshift quasars by simple color cuts ( @xcite ) which are missed by this color - selection algorithm .",
    "the problem objects are most likely to be objects that are just above the detection limit .",
    "the primary color - selection algorithm should work well for objects well - above the detection limit where our assumption of symmetric magnitude errors is roughly true .",
    "it also should work well for objects below the nominal detection limit ( as long as they are detected in the @xmath10-band ) , since we treat these objects specially .",
    "however , our assumption of symmetric magnitude errors ( see appendix  b ) can break down for objects just above the detection limit .    consider an object to the lower right of the stellar locus in @xmath56 , e.g. , at @xmath67 , @xmath68 , which is barely detected in @xmath15 .",
    "it will thus have large photometric errors in @xmath15 , large enough that its @xmath69 color is consistent with the stellar locus at @xmath46 .",
    "however , there are two ways of asking whether such an outlier is consistent with the stellar locus .",
    "first is to ask whether the errors of the object could make it consistent with the stellar locus .",
    "second is to ask whether an object in the stellar locus could be scattered into the region occupied by the outlier as a result of its errors .",
    "our algorithm is constructed from the first point of view .    for bright objects ,",
    "these are essentially the same question ; however , for objects near the limiting magnitude , but that are still detected , our assumption of symmetric magnitude errors causes these two viewpoints to diverge . if instead we took the second point of view , the @xmath15 magnitude of the corresponding object in the stellar locus would be substantially brighter",
    ", it would have substantially smaller errors , and our outlier would be inconsistent with the stellar locus .",
    "thus , if instead of asking whether the errors of the outlier make it consistent with the stellar locus , we asked whether the errors of a stellar locus object could cause it to scatter to the position of the outlier , we would get different answers ( under the assumption of symmetric magnitude errors ) .",
    "we attempt to correct for cases such as these where the color outlier algorithm may miss good quasar candidates by implementing some simple cuts in the @xmath18 color cube , as described in the next section .",
    "one of these cuts is designed to recover @xmath70 quasars , and the second cut is designed to recover @xmath71 quasars .",
    "finally , we wish to extend our qso_hiz sample to @xmath4 for objects with @xmath72 .",
    "these are outliers in the @xmath57 color diagram and are selected with simple cuts in this diagram , as described in the next section .      based on experience from previous multi - color quasar surveys and from our own commissioning data , we know that there are regions of color - space outside of the stellar locus which are dominated by objects other than quasars .",
    "there are also regions of color space populated by quasars that are not selected by the color outlier routines described above .",
    "therefore we have defined some regions of color space where objects are either explicitly included or excluded .",
    "we reject objects which lie in the regions that are typically dominated by white dwarfs ( wd ) , a stars , and m star - white dwarf pairs ( wd+m ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig : fig7 ] and   [ sec : exclusion ] for the boundaries of these boxes .",
    "in addition , as a result of the fact that , in the sdss color space , the `` quasar locus '' crosses the stellar locus for quasars with redshifts between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we must explicitly include a number of objects in this region in order to properly sample the distribution of quasars in this redshift range .",
    "this `` mid-@xmath11 '' inclusion box is also shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the inclusion of some of these objects as quasar candidates results in lower efficiency , but without this approach we would not be able to investigate this redshift range .    finally , we have instituted some color cuts to aid in the selection of high redshift quasars , as described in the previous subsection .",
    "we have also implemented a uvx color cut as an attempt at backwards compatibility with previous uvx surveys for quasars .",
    "each of these cuts in shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "objects in any of the three exclusion regions ( wd , wd+m , a stars ) are flagged as qso_reject , and are _ not _ targeted  unless they are also selected as first targets .",
    "after the qso_reject flag has been set , in the main survey , no further attempt is made to target these objects based upon their colors .",
    "however , we allow ourselves the option of targeting qso_reject objects in limited areas of the sky ( e.g. , in the southern survey area ) to explore the nature of the objects we are missing in the main survey .",
    "the white dwarf exclusion region , which is shown in dark blue in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] , includes objects which satisfy all the following criteria @xmath75 there are essentially no common astrophysical objects with colors bluer than the blue limits given above , but by applying these limits , we leave open the possibility of serendipitously discovering truly unusual objects .    next , we reject a stars , since their numbers are too small to have any effect upon the definition of the stellar locus ( see appendix a ) , but are found in sufficiently large numbers to significantly contaminate the quasar sample .",
    "the region that is rejected is defined by the intersection of @xmath76    the last region of color - space that we reject is that which is occupied by unresolved red - blue star pairs , usually m star and white dwarf pairs .",
    "these objects appeared as significant contaminants in the early target selection process when we attempted to target all point sources that were outside of the stellar locus .",
    "the color - space that is rejected is the intersection of @xmath77 where the additional restriction on the error in @xmath78 keeps us from rejecting too many normal stars with large errors ; such objects are outliers according to our stellar locus definition and are properly rejected by the stellar locus code .",
    "we note that except for the requirement that @xmath79 in the wd+m box , there are no formal requirements that the error in the colors be small for the objects in the exclusion regions .",
    "that is , we do not require that the objects be in the regions within their errors , just within the regions based on the measured colors .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] displays the spectra of three objects that are typical of the classes of objects that are excluded .",
    "the top panel shows a hot white dwarf , with its characteristic broad balmer lines , while the middle panel shows an a star lying in the box defined by equation  ( [ eq : astar ] ) .",
    "the lower panel shows a blue / red pair ; note the rising spectrum in the blue with strong balmer lines , and rising spectrum in the red with characteristic tio and vo bands .",
    "in addition to objects that are explicitly rejected by these three exclusion boxes , we also have a series of color cuts and boxes where objects are explicitly included even if they do not meet the other color - selection requirements .",
    "we specifically target `` mid-@xmath11 '' ( @xmath80 ) quasars in a small region of color - space where these quasars cross the stellar locus in sdss color space .",
    "we also explore three regions of color space for high redshift quasars that might otherwise be missed by the color outlier selection routine (   [ sec : colorselect ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig9 ] illustrates the mid-@xmath11 problem , showing a @xmath81 quasar spectrum , a star that inhabits the same region of color space , and the sdss filter curves .",
    "although the spectra do not cover the @xmath14 filter , we can see that even though the continua of the two spectra are different , the quasar emission lines cause the quasar to have very similar broad - band colors to the star .",
    "see figure 1 of @xcite for a similar figure using simulated spectra that shows that the @xmath60 colors of the quasar and star are also similar .",
    "the first inclusion region that we define is an attempt to deal with this problem near @xmath81 .",
    "if we failed to target quasar candidates in this region of color space , our completeness would be very low for @xmath80 , a range of tremendous importance for quasar absorption line studies such as measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , this redshift range covers the peak of the quasar co - moving number density @xcite .",
    "however , if we were to explicitly target all of the objects in this region of color space , our efficiency would become unacceptably low .",
    "thus , we have decided on a hybrid approach to allow a statistical study of the quasar population in this redshift range .",
    "first , we define a region in color space as follows : @xmath82    second , the selected objects are further restricted by requiring that they be point sources and that they lie outside of a @xmath83 region surrounding the stellar locus ( as opposed to the @xmath46 limit that we normally use ; see figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] ( green lines ) , along with   [ sec : colorselect ] and appendix a ) .",
    "finally , since this region of color space crosses the stellar locus , we choose to explicitly target only 10% of the objects in this mid-@xmath11 color box in order to limit our reduction in efficiency .",
    "this sparse sampling is accomplished by targeting only those objects whose tenths digit in decimal degrees right ascension is equal to seven , which is as good of a way of defining a random sample as any .",
    "the end result is that we target enough objects in this region ( flagged as qso_cap ) that we can correct for our incompleteness in a statistical sense without wasting too many fibers taking spectra of normal stars .",
    "another inclusion region involves quasars with @xmath49 .",
    "all objects which are detected in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , that have errors less than @xmath37 mag in both bands and @xmath84 are explicitly selected ( as qso_cap ) so long as they are not in the white dwarf exclusion box and satisfy the magnitude limits .",
    "this cut is intended to be the equivalent of previous uvx color - cuts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the sense that this cut selects objects with roughly the same upper limit in redshift ( namely @xmath49 ) .",
    "in reality , this cut does not cause many objects to be selected that are not otherwise selected as stellar locus outliers , but most of the candidates selected only because of this color - cut are indeed quasars or agn .",
    "the final series of color - cuts are designed to recover more high redshift quasars than would be possible by simply targeting red outliers from the stellar locus ( see the discussion at the end of   [ sec : griz ] ) .",
    "@xcite show that certain simple color - cuts are very effective in the selection of high - redshift quasars . as a result , we also target objects ( as qso_hiz ) that meet criteria similar to those used by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the cuts used herein are somewhat more inclusive than those used by @xcite , since we can afford a slightly lower selection efficiency as a trade - off for increasing our completeness .    similar to @xcite ,",
    "we create an inclusion region in @xmath56 color - space , which is intended to recover quasars with @xmath85 ( which are problematic for the stellar locus outlier code ) .",
    "the criteria for the @xmath56 inclusion region is the intersection of : @xmath86 cuts c ) and d ) , which involve @xmath56 color - space , are depicted in the upper right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig7 ] ( red line ) .",
    "the restriction on the @xmath21 errors , a ) , is to ensure the integrity of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 colors .",
    "the cuts in @xmath60 and @xmath89 , b ) , restrict the sample to @xmath14-band dropouts .",
    "the vertical cuts in @xmath69 and the diagonal cut , c ) and d ) , keep the region from getting too close to the stellar locus .",
    "finally , restriction e ) prevents most normal m stars from being selected and restriction f ) prevents objects that are too blue in @xmath88 to be high-@xmath11 quasars from entering the selection region .",
    "we similarly define a region in @xmath55 color space that is designed to select quasars with @xmath90 .",
    "these criteria are @xmath91 in this case , the @xmath89 and @xmath78 magnitude limits , b ) and c ) , are designed to restrict the sample to objects that are both @xmath14- and @xmath15-band drop - outs .",
    "the @xmath87 cut , d ) , places a limit on the amount of flux in the @xmath35-band in addition to keeping the selected objects from getting too close to the stellar locus . as above , the blue limit on @xmath88 ,",
    "e ) , is designed to reject objects which are too blue to be high-@xmath11 quasars .",
    "finally , the diagonal cut , f ) , limits the number of normal stars that stray into the inclusion region . in the lower left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig7 ] , we show ( as a red line ) the cuts that are relevant to the @xmath55 color plane , d ) , e ) , and f ) .",
    "finally , we add an inclusion region in @xmath57 color space that was not used by @xcite ; this cut is designed to recover @xmath92 quasars  especially those fainter than @xmath2 , which is the magnitude limit of the low - redshift sample , and those @xmath28 quasars that may be undetected in @xmath14 but which are not outliers in @xmath18 .",
    "the selection criteria used in this region are @xmath93 the cuts that correspond to the @xmath57 region of color space are shown ( as a red line ) in the upper left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig7 ] . both the magnitude limit on @xmath89 , a ) , and the color cut in @xmath60 , b ) , are meant to ensure that the objects are sufficiently red to be high-@xmath11 quasars .",
    "the diagonal cut , f ) , and the upper limit to @xmath69 , c ) , keep the objects from getting too close to the stellar locus ( especially where the errors get large for m stars ) .",
    "the @xmath87 cut , d ) , is also designed to limit the number of m stars making the cut . finally , as with the above high-@xmath11 regions , we exclude objects that are too blue in @xmath88 , e ) , to be real high-@xmath11 quasar candidates .    in practice , this @xmath57 high-@xmath11 cut is combined with another cut that selects outliers in the @xmath17 color - cube that are sufficiently red .",
    "these objects are required to be outside of the @xmath17 stellar locus and must be detected in both @xmath89 and @xmath78 , have @xmath89 and @xmath78 errors less than 0.2 mag and have @xmath94 .",
    "objects that meet these criteria or the @xmath57 high-@xmath11 criteria described above are allowed to be selected as quasar candidates ( flagged as qso_hiz ) to the fainter @xmath4 limit as long as they are not extended sources .",
    "how well does the quasar selection algorithm perform ? as discussed above , this is really two questions : what is the selection efficiency and what is the completeness ?",
    "we need to know both of these quantities as a function of redshift and magnitude ( both apparent and absolute ) .",
    "completeness and efficiency diagnostics were carried out using both simulated quasar photometry and empirical results from early sdss imaging and spectroscopy . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : commissioning ] , the empirical testbed contains all of the imaging data in runs 756 , 1035 , 1043 , 1752 , 1755 and some of run 752 . on the observational side ,",
    "completeness is defined as the fraction of previously known quasars in the appropriate magnitude range that are selected by the algorithm , as quantified in ",
    "[ sec : completeness ] .",
    "efficiency is defined as the fraction of quasar candidates that turn out to be quasars when spectra are taken .",
    "more spectroscopic data ( using the final version of the target selection code ) is needed in order to fully characterize the completeness and efficiency of the survey ; however , we have enough data to determine that the algorithm is meeting the goals for completeness and efficiency . in   [ sec : efficiency ] , we use data from over 100 square degrees with spectra available for 90% of the quasar candidates , and in   [ sec : completeness ] , we examine over 1500 known quasars in the testbed area along with the colors of over 50,000 simulated quasars .    to help determine the survey completeness we also make use of simulated quasar colors .",
    "we calculate the simulated distribution of quasar colors at a given redshift and magnitude , following the procedures described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic quasar spectrum model includes a power - law continuum and a series of broad emission lines .",
    "we use the same distributions of the power - law index for the quasar continuum ( @xmath95 ; @xmath96 ) and the equivalent widths for the emission lines as in @xcite ( except for , which now has a larger equivalent width ) .",
    "the synthetic quasar absorption spectrum takes into account intervening absorbers along the line of sight , including ly@xmath13 forest systems , lyman - limit systems and damped ly@xmath13 systems , using distribution functions similar to those used by @xcite .",
    "finally , we calculate the sdss magnitudes and the associated photometric error from the model spectrum in each band , using the filter transmission curves and system efficiency of @xcite , assuming a median seeing of @xmath97 fwhm .",
    "the simulated colors are generated for a uniformly distributed grid of redshift and @xmath10 magnitude .",
    "completeness testing was accomplished in two ways : checking to see that previously known quasars are recovered , and by evaluating the results of target selection for simulated quasars .",
    "we began by seeking to maximize the completeness of previously known quasars . to facilitate this we created a catalog of previously known quasars ; for details see @xcite .",
    "objects in this catalog were matched to the objects in the quasar target selection testbed data .",
    "table  [ tab : tab5 ] gives the results of this matching .",
    "in short , the sdss quasar target selection algorithm targets 1456 of 1540 ( 94.5% ) of known quasars that should have been targeted , and establishes an upper limit to the completeness of our algorithm with respect to real agn .",
    "these can be broken down into a number of categories .",
    "quasars from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) are recovered at the rate of 369 in 394 ( 93.7% ) ; 96.6% ( 56 of 58 ) of first quasars are recovered ( using both color and radio selection ) ; quasars discovered in the first 66 plates of sdss spectroscopic commissioning ( using a more liberal , but less efficient selection algorithm ) are recovered by the final quasar target selection algorithm at a rate of 1154 in 1210 ( 95.4% ) ; finally , 88.6% of high-@xmath11 quasars discovered during the early period of the sdss high-@xmath11 quasar follow - up campaign @xcite that satisfy the magnitude requirements are recovered ( 39 of 44 ) .",
    "note that the completeness of the last category is somewhat lower than the others because @xcite had less strict flag - checking requirements than does the main survey for quasars ; we can not afford to be as lenient during the main survey due to efficiency constraints .",
    "table  [ tab : tab5 ] also provides other information that may be relevant to the completeness of the sdss quasar survey .",
    "we find that most of the known quasars not selected by our algoritm are missing as a result of non - repeatable problems ( cosmic rays , etc . ) and not because of shortcomings of our selection algorithm .",
    "a known quasar that is missed because of one or more cosmetic defects would not necessarily be missed if new imaging data were obtained for that object .",
    "we would also like to quantify the completeness as a function of redshift and magnitude ; we do so with the grid of model quasars discussed above .",
    "these simulated quasars have a much more homogeneous distribution in redshift - magnitude space than do real quasars .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig10 ] shows the completeness of the selection function in redshift-@xmath21 space , whereas figure  [ fig : fig11 ] shows the completeness as a function of redshift and @xmath98 for the same simulated quasars .",
    "the resulting selection function is tabulated in table  [ tab : tab6 ] , as a function of @xmath10 magnitude for @xmath99 and as a function of @xmath11 magnitude for @xmath100 , where the quasars become @xmath10-band drop - outs .",
    "for the full grid of simulated quasars uniformly distributed between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the mean completeness is 94.6% .",
    "however , this fraction is somewhat misleading . our _ true _ completeness must actually be smaller than this number .",
    "this completeness assumes a uniform distribution of quasars in redshift space , which is unrealistic ; the true , overall completeness of the quasar survey will be different from the values quoted above . in particular , from figures  [ fig : fig10 ] and  [ fig : fig11 ] and table  [ tab : tab6 ] , it is evident that the average completeness is a function of quasar redshift and luminosity .",
    "the survey completeness is low in the redshift range @xmath103 , because at these redshifts the quasar locus crosses the stellar locus in the sdss color space , and we sparse sample in the mid-@xmath11 color box (   [ sec : inclusion ] ) that selects these quasars .",
    "the survey completeness is larger than 80% for all other redshifts up to @xmath104 for quasars @xmath105 magnitude brighter than the survey limit .",
    "note that the completeness is given in terms of `` true '' magnitude ( without photometric error ) in the simulation .",
    "therefore , the completeness does not immediately reach zero for quasars fainter ( or brighter ) than the survey limit ( @xmath106 for low-@xmath11 quasars , and @xmath107 for @xmath30 ) , as they are scattered into the selected range due to the photometric error .",
    "note also that the sdss is only sensitive to relatively luminous quasars ( @xmath108 ) for @xmath109 .",
    "in addition , the completeness based on the simulations is also an over - estimate because none of the simulated quasars are affected by cosmetic defects ( unlike the known quasars ) .",
    "we expect to miss a few percent of quasars due to non - repeatable defects , independent of redshift or apparent magnitude .",
    "that is , if we observed the same area of sky again , we would very likely recover these objects .",
    "of course , such incompleteness is independent of redshift and largely independent of color and brightness .",
    "we note that our algorithm is quite sensitive to red quasars  in contrast to most previous optically selected surveys .",
    "the reasons for this sensitivity are threefold .",
    "first , we are magnitude limited in the @xmath10-band instead of the @xmath110-band and are thus less sensitive to dust reddening effects which are a strong function of wavelength with stronger absorption in the blue .",
    "second , the precision of our photometry reduces the chance of a quasar being scattered into the stellar locus , or for photometry errors to broaden the stellar locus , which would shrink the region of color space in which we could select quasars .",
    "finally , we are not biased against regions of color space that are not known to harbor quasars ; to the extent possible we consider any source outside of the stellar locus to be a quasar candidate .",
    "one way to test the sensitivity of our color - selection algorithm is to ask what fraction of the radio - selected quasars are also color - selected .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : tab5 ] , of the known quasars that met our radio selection criteria , only 20 of the 162 ( 12.3% ) were not also selected according to their colors ( see also   [ sec : efficiency ] ) . of the 3814 quasars in the early data release ( edr ) quasar sample @xcite ,",
    "there were only 23 objects which were radio - selected only ; a composite of these 23 objects shows that they are quite reddened and tend to be low - ionization bal quasars .    understanding the completeness of the survey as a function of quasar properties is crucial for the sdss quasar key projects , the evolution of quasar luminosity function and large scale distribution of quasars . here",
    "we only present the survey completeness in term of its average value ( both from matching with known quasars and from the simulation ) .",
    "the completeness is also a function of the quasar sed , in particular the continuum shape and emission line strength .",
    "detailed discussion will be presented in a later work ; for high - redshift quasars , see the discussion in @xcite . in the sdss southern survey , for a relatively small area",
    ", we plan to relax a number of color constraints ( including various exclusion boxes ) in the quasar target selection algorithm , and push the selection closer to the stellar locus in the color space . in a future paper",
    ", we will use these data to address the completeness question in detail , especially for quasars at @xmath111 .",
    "although the process of testing the completeness of the algorithm using the southern survey is beyond the scope of this communication , we have begun the process .",
    "for example , we have further explored our completeness by investigating those objects that are flagged as qso_reject .",
    "one of the goals of the southern survey is to take spectra of all such objects that are otherwise good quasar candidates .",
    "as of this writing , we have taken spectra of 1640 qso_reject objects from runs 94 and 1755 using a modified version of the quasar target selection algorithm that 1 ) allows qso_reject objects to be selected , 2 ) targets _ all _ point sources in the mid-@xmath11 region ( as opposed to 10% ) , and 3 ) has fainter magnitude limits . of these 1640 , only 26 are agn that are not also selected by the main survey algorithm . of these ,",
    "the majority are weak liners @xcite with a strong stellar component , with redshifts @xmath112 .",
    "there are only two quasars with higher redshifts ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) ; one is a type ii quasar ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the parent sample of objects selected from runs 94 and 1755 is about @xmath115 objects .",
    "if 65% of these are quasars , we estimate that the wd , wd+m and a - star exclusion boxes (   [ sec : exclusion ] ) that are used to set the qso_reject flag are rejecting only @xmath116 of quasars that are outside of the stellar locus ( assuming that the objects that we have spectra of are representative of the full sample ) .",
    "thus , the exclusion boxes have a negligible effect upon our completeness .",
    "to test the efficiency of the algorithm , we used a @xmath117 square degree region of sky which has been targeted by the final version of the quasar target selection algorithm .",
    "in particular , we examined the 1872 quasar candidates with @xmath118 , @xmath119 ( runs 94 and 125 from the sdss early data release ; @xcite ) .",
    "of these objects , we have spectra in hand for all but 185 objects , which we believe to be largely spurious candidates due to the poor image quality of those early sdss runs .",
    "overall , we found that 1113 of the",
    "1687 quasar candidates with spectra are quasars or agn .",
    "this number corresponds to an efficiency of 66.0% , which is consistent with the a priori requirements for the algorithm . of the quasar candidates that are not quasars , 266 are galaxies ( 15.8% ) and 294 are stars ( 17.4% ) .",
    "table  [ tab : tab7 ] presents a summary of the efficiency results for @xmath117 square degrees of data ; its columns are 1 ) the number of quasar candidates , 2 ) the number of quasar candidates for which we have obtained spectra , 3 ) the number in column 2 that turn out to be quasars / agn , 4 ) the ratio of column 3 to column 2 , 5 ) the number in column 2 that turn out to be galaxies , 6 ) the ratio of column 5 to column 2 , 7 ) the number in column 2 that turn out to be stars , and 8) the ratio of column 7 to column 2 .",
    "in addition to the objects for which we obtained good spectra , there were 11 candidates that were assigned fibers , but that either had no spectra or were spectra of blank areas of sky .",
    "we found that two of these were the result of broken fibers in the spectrograph , one was a supernova , and the others were mostly asteroids .",
    "the contaminating galaxies come in three categories : star - forming , blue , emission - line galaxies at low redshift ; faint red objects at @xmath120 ; and compact e+a galaxies at @xmath121 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose strong balmer break mimics the onset of the ly@xmath13 forest in a high - redshift quasar in the sdss filter set .",
    "the contaminating stars are largely cool m and l stars , a few a , f , white dwarf , and white dwarf / m dwarf pairs , and a number of interesting objects , such as carbon stars and low - metallicity subdwarf m stars .",
    "we have also broken down the efficiency according to category : low-@xmath11 ( @xmath17 color selected ) , high-@xmath11 ( @xmath18 color selected ) , and first - selected quasar candidates .",
    "low-@xmath11 targets include 1392 quasar candidates , of which 1339 have spectra . of these 1339 , 1005 are quasars ( 75.0% ) , 233 are galaxies ( 17.4% ) , and 98 are stars ( 7.3% ) . of the quasars , 116 are @xmath122 , 16 are @xmath30 . of the 1392 candidates ,",

    "426 are exclusively high-@xmath11 ; 300 of these have spectra . of those 300 , only 72 are quasars ; 61 have @xmath122 , 55 have @xmath30 , and 7 have @xmath123 .",
    "in addition to the low-@xmath11 and high-@xmath11 selected objects , there are 74 first - selected quasar candidates , 69 of which have spectra . of these 69 , 60 are quasars ( 87.0% ) and 9 are stars ( 13.0% ) . of the 74 first targets ,",
    "22 were targeted only by matching with first sources .",
    "ten of these 22 are quasars , 9 are stars , and the remaining 3 do nt have a spectrum .",
    "we examined the spectra of the ten agn ; two are unusual bal quasars @xcite , several are at @xmath124 where the quasar and stellar loci cross , and the remaining few do nt look particularly unusual ; they are perhaps a bit redder than a typical quasar .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig12 ] shows examples of two quasars from the sample : one at z=3.6 which shows strong self - absorption in the and lines , and one low - redshift seyfert i galaxy ( note the ca h and k stellar absorption lines ) .",
    "also shown are examples of some of the non - quasars which are selected as quasar candidates : an e+a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose balmer break gives colors reminiscent of a quasar with the onset of the lyman alpha forest at @xmath125 ; an emission - line dominated starburst galaxy ; a carbon star ( e.g. , margon et al 2002 , in preparation ) ; and a low - metallicity subdwarf , whose broad absorption lines give colors quite separate from the stellar locus .    in summary",
    ", our current analysis shows that the algorithm is meeting the a priori requirement of 65% efficiency and we fully expect that further observations will confirm this result .",
    "this efficiency is a function of the selection method with efficiencies of 75.0% , 54.4% and 87.0% expected for low-@xmath11 ( @xmath17 ) color selection , high-@xmath11 ( @xmath18 ) color selection , and first radio selection , respectively .",
    "based on the testbed data , the sdss quasar target selection algorithm selects an average of @xmath126 quasar candidates per square degree ; the @xmath127 error in the mean is @xmath128 quasars per square degree .",

    "note that the sum of the densities does not equal the overall density due to overlaps between the categories . also , the first density is underestimated since not all of the runs were matched to first , yet we used the total area to compute the density , since it is difficult to determine the exact area in common .",
    "the true density of first sources is closer to one quasar per square degree ; however , only a small fraction of these are not also selected by the color algorithm , so this will have little effect on our total density of quasar candidates .      in figure",

    "the color - redshift relation for sdss quasars was presented in @xcite .",
    "multi - color quasar target selection is easy in principle as we have a good idea of what regions of color space are inhabited by quasars .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate how well one s algorithm handles more exotic objects and/or objects that occupy previously un- or under - explored regions of parameter space .",
    "this is one area where the sdss has an advantage over many previous quasar surveys .",
    "the quality and quantity of the data allow us to take full advantage of exploring large regions of parameter space .",
    "in fact , the quasar algorithm has allowed the discovery of a number of unusual objects , including extreme bal quasars ; see @xcite .",
    "the sdss quasar selection algorithm was largely designed prior to the start of the survey and was based on the idea that it should be possible to roughly fit a multi - dimensional surface to the locus defined by normal stars . using a small amount of commissioning data and the work of @xcite , we defined the initial set of stellar locus parameters .",
    "the evolution of these parameters based on a much larger set of data provides the backbone for the final version of the algorithm that we have described herein .    with the knowledge that we have gained in constructing this algorithm and with the plethora of sdss data that is now available to us",
    ", we can imagine how one might devise a superior algorithm , by making use of probability density functions in multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "such an algorithm might be designed as follows .",
    "first , take a large amount of sdss data that has known spectral properties ( or obvious spectral properties that can be discerned purely from the colors of the objects ) .",
    "place all of these objects on a 5d grid that includes four colors and a magnitude . at each of these grid points",
    ", we can then compute the probability that the objects in the bin are quasars . with this information , in principle",
    ", one could take a new object and compare it to a look - up table of probabilities based on the control sample .",
    "the definition of quasar candidates would then involve nothing more than setting a probability threshold .    the main difference between a probability density type of algorithm discussed above and",
    "the algorithm that we have actually implemented is that the algorithm described herein does not take into account the fact that the stellar locus cross - section is not necessarily gaussian , nor that the density of stars along the locus is not the same .",
    "thus this algorithm does not choose a threshold at constant stellar density .",
    "nevertheless the algorithm does create a well - defined stellar locus .    in practice ,",
    "the size of the look - up table would make a probability density type of algorithm impossible to implement as a result of the amount of time it would take to run such an algorithm .",
    "however , it is possible to overcome this hurdle by implementing a gaussian mixture model based on the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm @xcite , which fits gaussians to the distribution of objects in multidimensional parameter space and has the effect of reducing an otherwise unwieldy look - up table to a much smaller number of gaussian fits that describe the density of objects in multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "we have begun work on just such an algorithm , which we hope will eventually serve as a supplement to , and an independent crosscheck on , the current algorithm .",
    "we have presented the sdss quasar target selection algorithm .",
    "initial testing shows that the algorithm is better than 90% complete as determined by both previously known quasars and simulated quasars  consistent with the 90% completeness requirement that was established prior to the development of the algorithm .",
    "the expected efficiency of the algorithm ( in terms of what fraction of objects targeted as quasars turn out to be quasars ) is @xmath133%  again , consistent with the original requirement of 65% .",
    "this combination of completeness and efficiency is unprecedented in quasar surveys .",
    "the high - quality ccd photometry coupled with the stellar locus outlier and first selection techniques will aid in the exploration of new regions of parameter space that have been unexplored in previous surveys that have tended to rely on 2 - 3 color photometry from photographic plates using multi - color selection techniques .",
    "furthermore , the high efficiency allows us to complete the goal of obtaining spectra for 100,000 quasars during the sdss quasar survey in a remarkably short period of time , with relatively little contamination from non - quasars  all while maintaining a high degree of completeness as a function of quasar parameter space .",

    "ideally , the region of color - space inhabited by stars would be defined using a large , representative sample of stars with zero photometric errors .",

    "this algorithm is capable of generating a region of three - dimensional color space which consists of a series of overlapping right elliptical cylinders with half - ellipsoids on the ends . though it attempts to place these cylinders on the densest parts of color space , it falls short of describing a surface of constant stellar density .",
    "we parameterize the locus in the regions of color space extending from f stars through m stars .",
    "a stars have low enough density relative to the f - m stars that the @xcite algorithm does not fit them , so these stars are eliminated with a separate color cut .",

    "given the measured colors ( but not the errors in the colors ) , we determine which locus point is closest to the colors of the input object .",
    "we do this by looking at the euclidean distance in color space , not taking into account any variation in the width of the locus , to simplify the computation .",
    "if two locus points are equally distant from the datapoint , the redder one is chosen .",
    "if the closest locus point is not between the centers of the ending ellipsoids , then the closest locus point is reassigned to be the first one interior to the ellipsoid centers .",
    "the closest locus point has an associated unit vector along the axis of a right elliptical cylinder , and a defined elliptical cross section and orientation , which define the local region of color space inhabited by the locus of stars .",
    "the catalog entry under consideration is assumed to be a star if the extent of its error ellipsoid overlaps any portion of this right elliptical cylinder which is interior to the ellipsoids at the ends of the locus . in practice",
    ", we determine this by adjusting the size of the cylinder containing the locus of stars according to the extent of the error ellipse , and then asking whether the object s colors place it interior to this larger right elliptical cylinder .",
    "this is described in more detail below .",
    "first , we estimate the error ellipse in the @xmath182 plane .",
    "the variance , covariance matrix for this plane is given by : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the ( two dimensional ) covariance matrix in the @xmath185 plane , @xmath186 is the ( three dimensional ) covariance matrix in color space , and the sums are over the three coordinates : @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( for the @xmath17 color - cube , and similarly for the @xmath18 color - cube ) .",

    "when convolving the two ellipses , we will make two important assumptions : the error distribution around each data point is gaussian , and the distribution of stars within the stellar locus is gaussian .",
    "these assumptions allow us to represent each of the ellipses as a gaussian function , and , as such , we will convolve them .",
    "if one convolves two bivariate gaussians , @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( with elliptical cross sections ) , one obtains a third bivariate gaussian with elliptical cross section . here",
    "we will convolve the parameterized locus ellipse for the stellar locus in the @xmath195-@xmath196 plane with the rotated error ellipse , also in the @xmath195-@xmath196 plane . by convolving two gaussians with these ellipses as their cross sections",
    ", we will discover a third ellipse which we will use to determine if the data point is within the locus , or if it is a viable candidate for target selection .      in this convolution",
    ", @xmath193 represents the parametrized locus and @xmath194 represented the error ellipse rotated to the @xmath195-@xmath196 plane . after the convolution we are left with a gaussian which is given by : @xmath200    where : @xmath201@xmath202@xmath203 here @xmath204 and @xmath205 are products of the integration , while the various terms within the exponent come from completing the square to facilitate the integration .",
    "since we are only concerned with the elliptical cross section contained in the exponent , we will ignore the rest of the gaussian and concentrate solely on the exponent .",
    "after considerable algebra the convolved ellipse looks like the following : @xmath206 where : @xmath207@xmath208@xmath209 after a great deal of simplification , the convolved ellipse is given by : @xmath210 where @xmath211    the major and minor axes of the convolved ellipse are given by the eigenvalues of the matrix form of the ellipse and the angle of inclination is the angle of the eigenvector pointed in the direction of the major axis .",
    "the variance / covariance matrix for the convolved ellipse is : @xmath212 the characteristic equation of this matrix is given by @xmath213 solving this for the eigenvalues we get @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "these eigenvalues are the values which diagonalize the matrix , and thus they give the coefficients to any point @xmath216 which happens to lie on either the major or minor axis .",
    "thus the major and minor axes are given by : @xmath217 @xmath218 the angle of rotation of the ellipse is found from the angle of the eigenvector pointed towards the major axis : @xmath219 where @xmath220 here , @xmath221 and @xmath222 are positive by definition .",
    "we need not worry about taking the square root of a negative number when computing the angle , since @xmath223 for all cases . if @xmath224 , then the resulting ellipse is circular , so we arbitrarily assign @xmath225    we now can redefine the @xmath226 axes associated with the closest locus point to describe this new elliptical cross section . the value of @xmath227 must be added to the original angle @xmath228 describing the locus ellipse , since we have calculated the angle with respect to the @xmath229 axis",
    ". when adding , we must be sure to keep the new value of @xmath228 in the allowed range : @xmath230 .",
    "in addition to increasing the width of the excluded locus , we increase @xmath231 on the ends of the locus in a similar manner : @xmath232 @xmath233 where the k in this equation is not for the locus point which is closest to the datapoint , but instead for the locus point which is closest to the respective endpoints ( subject to being between the two endpoints ) .        if not all of the colors of the object are known , then we are free to find the allowed point in color space that is most likely to be in the locus .",
    "this is _ not _ in general the same as finding the colors that are closest to the locus point in the euclidean sense , since the parameterized region is an elliptical cylinder , not a sphere centered at the locus point .",
    "we instead wish to minimize the @xmath237 distance to the locus , where @xmath237 is given by : @xmath238 where @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 is the position in color space of the closest point .",
    "first , let s solve the case where only the @xmath242 color , is unknown . to make the equations easier to read",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath243 .",
    "the solution is : @xmath244 the first case above is the result of the minimization process .",
    "if the denominator is zero , but @xmath245 , then it follows that @xmath246 . also , either @xmath247 or @xmath248 .",
    "in the first case , we will only be able to find a color point in the locus if we can fortuitously set @xmath249 by moving along the @xmath242 axis . in the second case",
    ", we can not affect the magnitude of m. either case is optimized by setting @xmath250 . if the denominator is zero , but instead @xmath251 , then we still need either @xmath247 or @xmath248 . in the first case we can not affect the distance along the major axis , so we set the distance along the minor axis to zero .",
    "the second case gives us @xmath252 , so we might as well set @xmath253    if the value of @xmath242 is completely unknown , then we use this calculated @xmath254 to determine whether the object is consistent with being a star .",
    "if the value of the color , @xmath242 , is a limit , then we must ask whether the computed value is within the limits .",
    "if it is not , then we instead use the limiting @xmath242 value to determine whether the datapoint is consistent with being a star .",
    "next , we tackle the case where both the @xmath242 color and @xmath255 color are unknown",
    ". when two of the colors are unknown , one can find values that will put the point exactly on the line @xmath256 where @xmath257 is a free parameter .",
    "we can solve for @xmath257 , and then the two unknown colors using : @xmath258 if @xmath259 , then the line down the center of the locus is in the @xmath260 plane , so there are many values of @xmath242 and @xmath255 which will be on it .",
    "we arbitrarily choose the one on the locus point , since we know that this value is also within the @xmath261 limits of the stellar locus .",
    "the existence of limiting values in @xmath242 and @xmath255 make this a little trickier .",
    "first , we calculate the value of @xmath262 which places the point exactly on the center of the locus . in the case that this value is not consistent with the @xmath255 limits , we assign @xmath263 .",
    "since we now have only one missing color , we can use the procedure outlined above ( the case where only the @xmath242 color is unknown ) to calculate the optimal value of @xmath254 . if a limit was not reached",
    ", one can verify that the computed @xmath254 will be the same as if we had used @xmath264 .",
    "if this computed value of @xmath254 is within the allowed limits , then we have done the best we can .",
    "if it is not , then we set @xmath265 and then compute the optimal value of @xmath262 given @xmath254 and @xmath266 .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath262 , given @xmath254 and @xmath266 , can be computed by reassigning the axes ( @xmath267 ) in the equation that optimizes @xmath254 given @xmath262 and @xmath266 .",
    "the above equations and their permutations ( @xmath268 and @xmath269 ) are used to determine the values of @xmath254 , @xmath262 , and @xmath266 which are most likely to be included in the stellar locus , given the input limits on these quantities .",
    "once we have this coordinate in three dimensions , we can ask whether it is within the parameterized locus .",
    "we must have @xmath270 , where @xmath271 the point must also be within the ellipsoids at the ends of the locus .",
    "if @xmath272 , then we already know we are within the red end limit , since the locus point is guaranteed to be within the locus . similarly , if @xmath273 , we are guaranteed to be within the blue end limit .",
    "so , we need only check one of the ellipsoids .",
    "we ignore the fact that the locus may curve around in @xmath274 coordinates , and only look at the @xmath275 coordinates .",
    "we are within the ends of the locus if @xmath276 , where : @xmath277 @xmath278 here , the values of @xmath237 are computed using @xmath141 and @xmath142 for the end ellipses , but values of @xmath195 and @xmath196 are calculated from the closest locus point .",
    "if the previously calculated optimal values of @xmath279 and @xmath266 put us within the locus , then we are done .",
    "if we could not find values for the coordinates that made @xmath280 , then we are done . however , if the values failed only the end conditions , then there is a chance we could still put the datapoint in the locus by minimizing the distance to the center of the end ellipsoid : @xmath281 rather than the center of the cylinder associated with the closest locus point . here , @xmath282 is either @xmath283 or @xmath284 , depending on whether @xmath285 or @xmath286 .",
    "the primes indicate that the values are measured with respect to the position in color space of the locus point which is closest to the center of the end ellipsoid .",
    "the @xmath141 and @xmath142 widths are for the end ellipsoid , not the cylinder associated with the closest locus point .",
    "we now calculate for the datapoint a new optimal color which minimizes @xmath287 . if only @xmath242 is unknown , we compute @xmath288 and @xmath289 using the definition @xmath290 and @xmath291 is the position in color space of the locus point closest to the center of the end ellipsoid ( subject to @xmath292 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath293 which minimizes @xmath287 is @xmath294 where @xmath295 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 , and @xmath298 .",
    "the first case is the formal result of the minimization .",
    "the second case is for @xmath299 and @xmath300 ; in this case we can not affect the @xmath196 value , so we might as well find the best position within the @xmath301 ellipse .",
    "if instead we have @xmath302 , we instead put the object on the @xmath303 plane .",
    "if @xmath304 but @xmath305 , then we must have @xmath306 , since @xmath307 .",
    "if @xmath308 , then the object is either on the line of the locus or not , no change in x will give different results than the previous calculated optimal @xmath242 .",
    "all cases where @xmath304 and @xmath309 reduce to @xmath310 , and this sweeps up all of the cases not covered by the other criteria . again , if this computed value for @xmath293 violates a limit in @xmath242 , then we reassign @xmath242 to the limit .",
    "if both @xmath242 and @xmath255 are unknown , then we start by calculating the values which minimize @xmath287 .",
    "we deal with limits in the identical way as we did when we were minimizing @xmath237 .",
    "that is , we figure out the optimal value of @xmath242 and @xmath255 together , but only assign the @xmath255 value .",
    "then we figure out the optimal value of @xmath242 given that @xmath255 value and the fixed value of @xmath11 . this way we can deal with the limits in a sensible way .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath255 is given by : @xmath311 the first option is the formal minimization of @xmath287 . if @xmath312 , then the center of the ellipsoid is in the @xmath313 plane .",
    "therefore , we try to place the object on that center ( or as close as we can get , given that @xmath288 might not be zero ) . if the denominator is zero , then @xmath314 .",
    "this is true because we can not have @xmath315 due to the definition of our system .",
    "so , either @xmath316 or @xmath317 must be zero . either way , @xmath314 .",
    "if @xmath318 , we must have @xmath319 as well . additionally , either @xmath320 ( the endpoint is the only hope ) or @xmath321 ( @xmath229 is in the @xmath313 plane , so the endpoint is still the best choice , if we can get there ) .    as before ,",
    "we then adjust @xmath322 if it is outside the allowed limits , then use our equations for only @xmath293 missing to find the optimal @xmath323 . if the computed value of @xmath323 is outside the limits , then we set @xmath323 to the limit , and recompute the optimal value of @xmath324",
    ".    we can not think of a case in which the new position is in the interior side of the endplane at @xmath282 .",
    "so , all we have to do is figure out if the new position satisfies @xmath325 and is interior to the @xmath261 limits on the outer surface of the ellipsoid .",
    "if it is , then it is consistent with being a star , otherwise it is not .",

    "<S> we describe the algorithm for selecting quasar candidates for optical spectroscopy in the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> quasar candidates are selected via their non - stellar colors in @xmath0 broad - band photometry , and by matching unresolved sources to the first radio catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> the automated algorithm is sensitive to quasars at all redshifts lower than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> extended sources are also targeted as low - redshift quasar candidates in order to investigate the evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at the faint end of the luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> nearly 95% of previously known quasars are recovered ( based on 1540 quasars in 446 square degrees ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall completeness , estimated from simulated quasars , is expected to be over 90% , whereas the overall efficiency ( quasars : quasar candidates ) is better than 65% . </S>",
    "<S> the selection algorithm targets ultraviolet excess quasars to @xmath2 and higher - redshift ( @xmath3 ) quasars to @xmath4 , yielding approximately 18 candidates per square degree . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to selecting `` normal '' quasars , the design of the algorithm makes it sensitive to atypical agn such as broad absorption line quasars and heavily reddened quasars . </S>"
