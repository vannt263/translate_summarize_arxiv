    "@xmath1  cma is known to be an b0.5 pulsator with sharp lines .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field of this star , first detected by @xcite with fors1 , is detected consistently in over 5 years of observations , but has remain approximately constant at bz @xmath2375 g. within the rigid rotator paradigm , two explanations can explain this behaviour : either the star rotates very slowly , or the stellar or magnetic geometry is responsible for the constant value of the longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "we acquired 18 stokes @xmath3 espadons spectra ( @xmath4  nm , @xmath5 , s / n@xmath6 per 1.8 km / s pixel ) with the aim of precisely studying the magnetic field , investigating the rotational period and geometry .",
    "we employed cmfgen to determine physical and wind parameters of @xmath1  cma .",
    "the luminosity was computed using the parallax of @xcite , which provides a good fit to the iue ( swp+lwr ) low resolution and large aperture data .",
    "an e(b - v ) of 0.04 was also used .",
    "we find @xmath7  k , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the projected rotational velocity is constrained to be @xmath12  km / s .",
    "longitudinal magnetic field measurements were inferred using least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) with a line mask carefully customised to the spectrum of @xmath1  cma . all spectra yield definite detections of stokes @xmath3 profiles and flat diagnostic n profiles with longitudinal field uncertainties of @xmath27 g. a straight - line fit to the longitudinal field measurements extracted from stokes @xmath3 gives a reduced @xmath13 of 4.8 , while analogous measurements extracted from diagnostic @xmath14 give reduced @xmath13 of just 1.1 .",
    "this points to weak variability of stokes @xmath3 that is not present in @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath1  cma is a well - known @xmath0  cep pulsator that displays monoperiodic radial mode photometric and line profile variability with a period of 0.209 days ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our spectra sample the full pulsational cycle and reveal a peak - to - peak radial velocity variation of 38 km.s@xmath15 .",
    "we perfomed a period search of the stokes @xmath3 longitudinal field measurements using a lomb - scargle algorithm , detecting significant power at 4.2680 days .",
    "when the longitudinal field measurements are phased with this period they describe a sinusoidal variation with amplitude @xmath230 g and reduced @xmath13 of 1.2 .",
    "we observed emission in the h@xmath16 line profile .",
    "we extracted the emission profile from each spectrum by first using h@xmath0 to construct a photospheric template , then subtracting a model photospheric profile from the h@xmath16 profile .",
    "the derived emission profile is approximately constant and characterised by a fwhm of @xmath2120 km.s@xmath15 .",
    "the uv c  iv and si  iv wind lines of @xmath1  cma show no variability in iue spectra acquired in 1978 and 1979 .",
    "they are remarkably similar to those of the magnetic star @xmath0  cep at phases of maximum emission ( i.e. when the star is viewed closest to the magnetic pole ) .",
    "this could imply that we currently view @xmath1  cma near its magnetic pole as well .",
    "such a configuration is potentially consistent with either a long rotation period or a pole - on geometry .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of variability observed in the uv and optical wind lines leads us to prefer the pole - on geometry model .",
    "the lack of any secular change in the field during the period of observation , in combination with the very high precision of the magnetic measurements , suggests either that the rotational period of the star is remarkably long , or that the stellar geometry is such that the disc - integrated line - of - sight component of the field remains approximately constant .",
    "the latter model is more consistent with the observed stability of the h@xmath16 and uv line emission , the uv line morphology , and the period detected in the longitudinal field measurements .",
    "if @xmath0  cep has @xmath17=60@xmath18 and @xmath0=85@xmath18 , the magnetic pole comes within 35@xmath18 of the line of sight .",
    "if we accept the arguments above , the magnetic pole of @xmath1  cma must come similarly close to the line of sight , and furthermore it must remain there .",
    "this would all hold together if the 4.26 day period is in fact the stellar rotation period .",
    "this would require very low inclination ( 5 to 10@xmath18 ) to be consistent with the low vsini , and in that case the weak modulation of the longitudinal field can be matched by a 1450 g dipole with obliquity @xmath0=25@xmath18 .",
    "this would imply , in fact , that the magnetic pole is never more than 30@xmath18 from the line of sight .",
    "an accurate determination of the @xmath19 of this star is critical to confirming this view , as effectively any non - zero value of @xmath19 would imply that the rotational period is shorter than the total span of the observations ."
