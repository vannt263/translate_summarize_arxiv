    "the unique physical properties of carbon nanotubes and the flexibility they provide in selecting their characteristics offers great potential for nanotechnology  @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes can be either semi - conducting or metallic , depending on their diameter and helical configuration .",
    "they typically have nanometer sized diameters and a length of a few microns , although centimetre long nanotubes have been produced recently  @xcite .",
    "this makes them ideal 1d systems that possess a ballistic conducting channel  @xcite , no backward scattering , and energy levels that can be adjusted with external fields  @xcite .",
    "superconductivity has also been observed in multi - walled carbon nanotubes and single carbon nanotubes have exhibited a superconducting proximity effect  @xcite .",
    "their applications range from extremely strong fibers and organic electronics  @xcite to electrochemical sensors  @xcite and photon detectors  @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes are a form of carbon formed by rolling up a sheet of graphene into a cylindrical tube .",

    ", these properties have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "their quasi one - dimensionality means that their density of states exhibit van hove singularities and these contribute to strong optical absorption peaks .",
    "however , these results apply the dipole approximation , where it is assumed that the field does not vary along the nanotube s length .",
    "we extend this treatment by allowing for the spatial dependence of the field .",
    "this situation is particularly relevant when the electrons are delocalized in a tightly - confined field , such that the field varies greatly over a few hundred nanometres .",
    "the degree to which the electrons are delocalized is a topic of ongoing research and various studies have been done on the coherence length in nanotubes .",
    "their results range from @xmath0 nm to several microns suggesting that the spatial field dependence is certainly important for confined fields and may also be relevant for plane waves  @xcite .     and @xmath1 .",

    "the electrical field of a nanofiber is tightly confined and primarily exists outside of the fiber , in a large evanescent field  @xcite . due to the presence of a strong field in a relativity small volume , these nanofibers are ideal candidates to achieve a high optical absorption in atomic systems .",
    "for example , their interaction with atom - arrays has been studied  @xcite . however ,",
    "in contrast to such atom - fiber systems , the dipole approximation can not be applied in the case of nanotubes since the optical field typically changes rapidly along a nanotube s length . in this paper",
    "we calculate the ( internal ) quantum efficiency , i.e. the probability that a nanotube , placed inside the evanescent field of a nanofiber , absorbs a photon .",
    "calculations for the external quantum efficiency , i.e. the efficiency for detecting the excitation with the photocurrent , are beyond the scope of this paper . however , it should be noted that important effects that could aid in this procedure , such as the avalanche effect , have been observed in carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "we focus specifically on the example of zigzag nanotubes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) because they can be direct semiconductors . however , our results are still representative of other semiconducting nanotube types such as chiral nanotubes .",
    "we find that the absorption is extremely dependent on the nanotube s orientation .",
    "these results are highly relevant for the interface between any future nanoscale photonics and carbon nanotubes",
    ". if the absorption process is coherent the system may also be suitable as a quantum memory , that maps a photonic quantum state on to a coherent excitation of the nanotube .",
    "we will be using the band - to - band tight binding transition model for the carbon nanotube .",
    "this has proven itself to be very effective in determining the basic optical properties of nanotubes but does not include effects due to excitons  @xcite and electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "such effects give measurable corrections and there have been a few studies considering the exciton absorption strength  @xcite .",

    "we obtain general expressions for the absorption probability which are then applied to cylindrical vacuum cladded silica nanofibers in sec",
    ".  [ sec4 ] , and discuss different geometrical setups of nanofiber and nanotube .",

    "here we will review the basic properties of carbon nanotubes for completeness and layout the notation that we use in later sections . a single walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt )",
    "can be thought of as a sheet of graphene wrapped into a tube , so we will start by describing the tight - binding model of graphene  @xcite .",
    "graphene is a regular 2d hexagonal bravais lattice of carbon atoms and its structure is shown in fig .",
    "we label the unit vectors of the graphene lattice @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "the length of these vectors is the lattice constant @xmath2 which is related to the distance between neighboring carbon atoms , @xmath3 , by @xmath6 nm . within each unit cell",
    "there are two carbon atoms , that we label to form the a and b sublattices .",
    "we can then define the unit vectors of the reciprocal lattice as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . the first brillouin zone given by these is also hexagonal .",
    "it has a selection of points with high - symmetry ; one at the center , the midpoints of the hexagonal edges and two inequivalent types of corners .",
    "the well - established tight - binding model assumes that the electrons are tightly bound to the individual carbon atoms and the localized atomic orbitals are used as a basis for expanding the wavefunction .",
    "we consider orbitals that contribute to states that lie within an optical range of energies around the fermi level .",
    "these are the states that give the main contributions to the optical properties of the nanotube .",
    "every carbon atom has four valence orbitals ( 2s , 2@xmath10 , 2@xmath11 and 2@xmath12 ) that could lie in this energy range . for 2d graphene",
    "the ( s , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) orbitals combine to form hybridized @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "these give the strong covalent bonds ; primarily responsible for the binding energy and elastic properties of the nanotubes . in the tight - binding model they result in @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "however , their energy levels are far away from the fermi level and hence they do not play a key role in the optical properties that we are interested in .",
    "that role is played by delocalized @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands that are formed from the @xmath12 orbitals  @xcite .",
    "hence , we can ignore the @xmath14 electrons and restrict the tight - binding model to the @xmath16 electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath20 refers to nearest neighbors . here ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the creation operators for electrons in sublattice a and b , respectively . in this hamiltonian we have removed the constant energy contribution that corresponds to the fermi level .",
    "we expand the wavefunction in terms of @xmath12 orbitals at every atom site and split this expression into two parts ; one for each sublattice .",
    "the wavefunction for each state is then @xmath23 with @xmath24,@xmath25 labeling the atom locations in sublattice a and b , respectively . the individual @xmath12 orbitals are given by the normalized wavefunctions @xmath26 and each one has a coefficient , represented with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . by using translational symmetry",
    "we can represent this as @xmath29 where the bloch functions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the number of unit cells in the graphene sheet .",
    "these bloch functions have the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the states are labeled by their crystal momentum vector @xmath36 .",
    "we now solve the time - independent single - particle schrdinger equation @xmath37 we define the quantity @xmath38 where @xmath39 are vectors from an atom in the a sublattice to its neighboring atoms in the b lattice .",
    "this gives us the following quantities @xmath40 now the variational schrdinger equation in matrix form is @xmath41 the above matrix equation can be solved to give the energy of each state as @xmath42 where @xmath43 a typical value for @xmath44 is @xmath45ev such that the tight - binding model corresponds with experiments  @xcite .",
    "we will keep @xmath46 in the equations but for all plots and numerical calculations we assume that @xmath47 , i.e. there is no orbital overlap . in fig .",

    "this assumes the nanotube bands are the same as graphene but with limited @xmath36 , due to the 1d nature of a carbon nanotube .",
    "there are a variety of ways available to wrap the sheet up into a nanotube , each of which result in very different properties .",
    "the nanotubes are characterized by a vector in the graphene plane that corresponds to the circumference of the nanotube and is called the chiral vector @xmath49 @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it gives the relative position of two graphene atoms that become ` identical ' when the graphene is rolled into a nanotube .",
    "we will use these parameters in the standard form @xmath51 to label each type of nanotube .",

    "it is the periodic boundary condition along the circumferential direction of the tube that causes the wave vector to become quantized and each discrete cutting line is labeled by the azimuthal quantum number @xmath70 . for short nanotubes",
    "the wave vectors are also quantized along the nanotube s length causing discrete energy levels to be formed  @xcite .",

    "such effects will be ignored here . typically , the nanotube is assumed to be of infinite length , allowing continuous values of the wave vector along the nanotube axis .",
    "this causes possible wave vectors to lie in ` subbands ' .",
    "the subbands can cut through the fermi points of graphene causing the tube to become metallic .",
    "this can be shown to be the case for nanotubes of the type @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a multiple of three .",
    "if this is not the case there is a nonzero band gap and the nanotube is semiconducting . here",
    "we consider ` zigzag ' semiconducting nanotubes of the form @xmath75 , with @xmath76 not a multiple of three .",

    "this expression gives a probability that increases linearly with nanotube length .",
    "this is certainly suitable up to the coherence length , @xmath161 , however not for long nanotubes .",
    "so far we have considered the length of the nanotube to be smaller than the coherence length . for long nanotubes we can consider the whole nanotube to be composed of coherent segments .",
    "this leads to an exponential increase in the absorption with the nanotube length . here , to calculate this quantity we find the probability of not exciting any electrons , which is the product of @xmath162 for each segment .",

    "so far we have assumed the light to be in a pure state consisting of one specific wavelength . we expect to have a range of wavelengths present and to deal with this we assume the light is in a probabilistic mixture of coherent beams , each with a photon flux @xmath97 .",
