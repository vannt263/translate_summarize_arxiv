    "in a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom the poincare map acts on a two dimensional domain .",
    "the chaotic invariant set is represented by the well known horseshoe construction of smale @xcite . in the meantime",
    "it has been worked out quite well , how in the case of open systems ( scattering systems ) the properties of this chaotic set are seen in scattering functions @xcite and in scattering cross sections @xcite .",
    "the corresponding investigations become a lot more complicated when we proceed to systems with more degrees of freedom . therefore relatively little",
    "has been done for more degrees of freedom . in the present article we present some results for one class of higher dimensional scattering systems , namely the one with one open and two closed degrees of freedom .",
    "our strategy to attack this higher dimensional case is based on an idea introduced to treat elliptical orbits in reduced three - body systems @xcite , which is actually much in the spirit of moshinskys work in nuclear physics .",
    "we start from a system with a symmetry and a conserved quantity ( in the former case the jacobi integral ) .",
    "then the three degrees of freedom system can be reduced to a continuum of systems with two degrees of freedom where the numerical value of the conserved quantity serves as parameter .",
    "we use the knowledge of the techniques for the two degree of freedom case , to treat the reduced system .",
    "then we embed the continuum of the reduced systems into the full six - dimensional phase space to assemble the corresponding higher dimensional structures still for the symmetric case . in other words",
    ", we find the solution for the symmetric case .",
    "finally we break the symmetry to get to the true three degrees of freedom case . here",
    "we show that the breaking of the symmetry does not have important effects on the qualitative properties of the structure , at least as long as the symmetry breaking is weak .",
    "the argument is supported by numerical calculations .",
    "for hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom the poincar map acts on a four dimensional domain .",
    "the first thing to do is to describe in the domain of the four dimensional poincar map the higher dimensional analog of the two dimensional horseshoe we obtain , when a symmetry reduces the effective dimensionality of the system .    as representative example of the class of system we want to treat we imagine the motion of a particle in a channel with an obstacle .",
    "the empty channel is cylindrical and thereby has a rotational symmetry in the azimuth angle @xmath0 .",
    "the obstacle is represented by a short range potential depending on a parameter a which describes the deviation of the obstacle from rotational symmetry .",
    "for a=0 the obstacle is symmetric in azimuth direction and the conjugate angular momentum @xmath1 is conserved and the rotational symmetry allows the reduction to two degrees of freedom .",
    "a natural choice for the intersection condition for the poincare map is the choice of relative maxima of the cylindrical radius @xmath2 .",
    "every times when the particle runs through a relative maximum of @xmath2 we measure the values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are position and conjugate momentum along the axis of the channel .",
    "the space of these four coordinates is the domain of the poincar map .",
    "one possibility to proceed is to set up particular models for the channel and the potential of the obstacle and to study solutions of hamilton s equations of motion and to obtain the poincare map from them .",
    "we do something simpler and more direct .",
    "we set up a model function for the poincare map which serves as prototype example ( paradigm ) for the whole class of systems .",
    "we compose it from three steps : first , half of a free flight second , a kick generated by the generating function @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the maximally possible value of @xmath1 , indirectly @xmath6 fixes the value of the total energy @xmath7 .",
    "third , again half a free flight for the potential function @xmath8 appearing in eq .",
    "[ genfun ] we take @xmath9 for @xmath10 the map becomes independent of @xmath0 and reduces to a map acting on the @xmath3 , @xmath4 plane .",
    "this reduced map depends on the conserved value of @xmath1 as parameter .    because the potential of eq .",
    "[ potv ] is purely attractive the points @xmath11 act as outer fixed points of the map and we use their invariant manifolds to construct the horseshoe of the reduced system .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     in figs .",
    "[ fundisp1 ] , [ fundisp2 ] and [ fundisp3 ] we show an example of this function for three values of a , namely @xmath12 in parts a and b , @xmath13 in parts c and d and @xmath14 in parts e and f. the scattering flow casts a kind of shadow image of the homoclinic tangle into the outgoing asymptotic region and in the scattering functions we see exactly this shadow image .",
    "singularities of the scattering function , i.e. boundaries of intervals of continuity of this function indicate initial conditions on the stable manifold of the nhim at infinity .",
    "thereby an analysis of the singularities of scattering functions allows the reconstruction of all the important information concerning the chaotic set .",
    "observe that for @xmath10 the scattering function has a factorization into a fractal structure in @xmath15 direction and constancy in @xmath16 direction .",
    "accordingly the function shows intervals of continuity which are the product of an interval in @xmath15 direction with a circle in @xmath16 direction . for @xmath17 small only very tiny intervals of continuity of high level of hierarchy",
    "change their qualitative structure .",
    "the larger intervals keep their basic topology of a strip running around in @xmath16 direction .",
    "we have to go to the very strong symmetry breaking of @xmath18 to see the largest intervals change their qualitative structure .",
    "in this section we explain how the fractal chaotic set in phase space or in the poincar map causes a fractal pattern of rainbow singularities in the cross section . for the case of three degrees of freedom",
    "we generalize the ideas developed in @xcite for the case of two degrees of freedom .",
    "usually in scattering experiments we do not have any control over the relative phase shift variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we keep @xmath7 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 fixed and the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 have a random distribution with constant density on a two dimensional torus .",
    "we measure the relative probability to find values @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity properly normalized with respect to the incoming flow is the doubly differential cross section . to calculate this cross section for a particular pair of values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 we have first to find all the preimages @xmath23 of the scattering function which lead to these particular values of the final variables .",
    "then we have to calculate the determinant @xmath24\\ ] ] in the particular initial preimage point k. the cross section is given by @xmath25 we see immediately that the cross sections has singularities for such values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 where the determinant of eq .",
    "[ detk ] is zero . these are values where several preimages collide and disappear , they are projection singularities of the scattering function .",
    "these singularities are of one over square root type , therefore the integral over the cross section is finite and there are no problems with flux conservation . as long as the system is close to the symmetric case the scattering function in each interval of continuity is similar to a ring shaped mountain and accordingly the projection singularity of this function looks like the one of half a torus ( for details see @xcite ) . fig .",
    "[ unasing ] shows the cross section contribution from a single interval of continuity .",
    "fig.[varsing ] shows the singularities from the whole toroidal domain of the scattering function .",
    "the pattern seen in fig.[varsing ] coincides with what a detector in a real experiment might see .",
    "it is a fractal repetition of the basic singularity structure from fig.[unasing ] .    .",
    "note that this figure coincides with the projection of half a torus or of a ring shaped mountain .",
    "the caustics of this projection lead to one over square root singularities ( rainbow singularities ) in the cross section.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    .",
    "in contrast to fig.7 here the contributions from the complete domain of the scattering functions are included .",
    "this pattern of singularity lines is a fractal repetition of the basic pattern created by a single interval of continuity as shown in fig.7.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    we can change a parameter of the system , this might be the symmetry breaking parameter , or a action like initial condition , this might be the incoming angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "when we measure the cross section singularities as function of this parameter then we can follow in the cross section the changes of the chaotic set under these changes of the system .",
    "this is an interesting contribution to the inverse chaotic scattering problem .",
    "the stable manifold of a nhim at infinity consists of trajectories which go out to infinity while at the same time the longitudinal momentum goes to zero , they are trajectories which arrive at infinity with velocity zero .",
    "these manifolds are separatrix surfaces between trajectories going out to infinity and trajectories which return to the interaction region at least once more before eventually also going out to infinity .",
    "the trajectories on the unstable manifolds show the same behaviour under time reversal .",
    "the homoclinic / heteroclinic tangle between the stable and unstable manifolds of the nhim at @xmath27 are the higher dimensional generalizations of the horseshoes in two dimensional maps . in our class of systems",
    "this chaotic structure exists for all values of the total energy @xmath7 .",
    "the reason is that in our class of systems for any value of @xmath7 there are trajectories going out to infinity with longitudinal velocity zero .",
    "this happens thanks to the closed degrees of freedom which can swallow up any amount of energy such that only energy zero is left for the open degree of freedom . in this sense",
    "our system is at a channel threshold of the inelastic scattering for any value of @xmath7 .    because of these considerations it is clear that we do not expect a similar behaviour for scattering systems with open degrees of freedom only . for a discussion of this point for scattering off four hard spheres",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the poincare map of this system has hyperbolic fixed points but does not have any nhim .    for systems with more than three degrees of freedom similar considerations hold . for each additional degree of freedom the nhim and",
    "its manifolds acquire two additional neutral directions .",
    "the domains of the scattering functions and of the cross section acquire one additional dimension .",
