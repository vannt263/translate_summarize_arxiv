    "the bulk of the chemical elements heavier than iron are thought to be produced by neutron induced reactions in the astrophysical s- and r - processes @xcite .",
    "a tiny fraction of the heavy elements , however , can not be synthesized by these processes since some of the most proton rich isotopes ( the so - called p nuclei ) lie outside the path of both the s- and r - processes .",
    "it is generally accepted that the main mechanism contributing to the synthesis of the p isotopes is the so - called @xmath0-process @xcite which takes place in high temperature stellar environments .",
    "the @xmath0-process converts the isotopes at the bottom of the valley of stability to proton rich species by consecutive ( @xmath0,n ) photodisintegration reactions .",
    "charged particle emitting ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath0,p ) reactions play also an important role in a @xmath0-process reaction flow model .",
    "the presently available @xmath0-process models fail to reproduce the p isotope abundances observed in the solar system .",
    "this can in part be explained by the ambiguous astrophysical conditions under which the process may take place . on the other hand deficiencies of the nuclear physics input of the models can also be responsible for the failure .    in lack of experimental data @xcite the reaction rates are typically taken from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations . at the astrophysically relevant low energy range",
    "the few available experimental datasets show that the statistical model does not give a satisfactory estimation of the cross sections @xcite .",
    "especially severe deficiencies are encountered in the case of reactions involving charged particles .",
    "therefore , the measurement of reaction cross sections relevant for the @xmath0-process is important in order to test the statistical model predictions and to put the @xmath0-process models on a more reliable ground .",
    "the ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath0,p ) reactions are preferably studied by measuring the cross section of the inverse capture reactions @xcite .",
    "one of the first reactions that were studied for the purpose of the @xmath0-process have been the proton capture reactions on several stable mo isotopes by sauter and kppeler @xcite .",
    "this mass region deserves special attention owing to the exceptionally large natural abundances of @xmath2mo and @xmath7mo p isotopes which are notoriously and severely underproduced in @xmath0-process models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the results of the work of sauter and kppeler @xcite on the @xmath2mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath3tc reaction show a strong fluctuation of the cross section as a function of the energy ( see table 4 . and fig . 5 in @xcite",
    "this feature is explained by the low level density of the neutron magic @xmath3tc isotope .",
    "however , one of the basic assumptions of the statistical model is that level density is high enough so that a statistical treatment is possible .",
    "the statistical model is thus not able to reproduce the observed strong fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the careful study of this reaction is very important in order to provide reliable reaction rates for @xmath0-process networks .",
    "recently the @xmath2mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath3tc reaction was studied again by the cologne group with both activation and in - beam @xmath0-spectroscopy methods @xcite .",
    "no final results of these measurements have been published yet , but the preliminary results show rather big deviation from the data of ref.@xcite ( see fig .",
    "2 . in @xcite ) . in order to investigate the apparent disagreement of the two available datasets and to study the fluctuations of the excitation function ,",
    "the aim of the present work is to measure the @xmath2mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath3tc cross section using a different experimental technique .",
    "one possible source of uncertainty in cross section measurements utilizing thin targets is the determination of the number of target atoms , the uniformity of the target layers and the stability of the targets under beam bombardment .",
    "this uncertainty can be avoided if an infinitely thick target which stops completely the proton beam is used instead of a thin target layer with known thickness .",
    "in such a measurement the thick target yield is determined instead of the cross section itself .",
    "if the thick target yield as a function of energy is measured with small enough energy steps , the cross section can be obtained by differentiating the yield curve ( see section[sec : results ] for further details of the cross section determination ) .",
    "the only information which is needed about the target is the stopping power value which is known to a precision of 3.2% in the case of protons in metallic mo @xcite .",
    "radiative proton capture on @xmath2mo can populate either the ground state or the isomeric state of @xmath3tc .",
    "both of these states decay by electron capture or positron emission to @xmath3mo ( the isomeric state also decays to the ground state of @xmath3tc by internal transition ) .",
    "these decays are followed by characteristic gamma - ray emissions which can be used to determine the partial cross sections leading to the ground and isomeric states separately by the activation method .",
    "table [ tab : decay ] summarizes the relevant decay parameters of the studied isotopes .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the obtained reaction rate values are listed in table  [ tab : rate ] .",
    "the columns labeled `` rate contribution '' indicate how much the different energy regions contribute to the rate .",
    "the column labeled `` exp . '' shows the contribution of the 17003100kev experimentally studied energy range to the rate .",
    "similarly , columns `` low '' and `` high '' , respectively , show the contribution of low and high energy yield extrapolation to the rate .",
    "the table clearly shows that in the temperature range between about 1.5 and 3.5 gk the experimentally determined yields give the dominant contribution to the reaction rate .",
    "this energy range is relevant for the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis , therefore almost purely experimental reaction rate can be provided for this reaction .",
    "the uncertainty of the reaction rate is calculated by the following procedure : in the measured 17003100kev energy range the experimental yield uncertainty of typically 7% is used . outside this region , both to high and low energies , a 100% uncertainty is assigned to the extrapolated yield .",
    "the uncertainty values listed in table  [ tab : rate ] reflects this procedure : where the rate is determined by the experimental energy range the uncertainty is relatively low , while it is increasing towards lower and higher temperatures .",
    "this is the reason why the rate values are shown only in the 1.04.5gk temperature interval .",
    "the last columns of the table show the rates obtained by sauter and kppeler @xcite , roughton _",
    "_ @xcite and calculated with the non - smoker code @xcite .",
    "the results of roughton _",
    "are in good agreement with our data while the rates of sauter and kppeler are higher by about a factor of 1.4 to 2.2 .",
    "the comparison with the statistical calculations carried out with the non - smoker code shows that the model overestimates the reaction rate by about a factor of 2 .",
    "this is in agreement with the s - factor comparison which is shown in fig.[fig:92totmo_res ] .",
    "the model overestimates the experimental cross section and the deviation increases with increasing energy .",
    "this explains the increasing difference between the measured and calculated rates towards higher temperatures .",
    "the @xmath2mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath3tc and @xmath4mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath8tc reaction were studied by measuring thick target yields in the proton energy interval between 1700 and 3100 kev . by differentiating the thick target yield curve ,",
    "cross sections of the studied reactions were calculated . in the case of the @xmath4mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath8tc reaction the obtained cross sections are in good agreement with previous data and model calculations .",
    "the previously observed strong fluctuations in the @xmath2mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath3tc reaction cross section are confirmed in the present work . for this reaction",
    "partial cross sections leading to the ground and isomeric state in @xmath3tc were measured separately .",
    "the isomeric state cross section is in good agreement with the results of sauter and kppeler @xcite , while the obtained ground state cross sections are lower than the sauter and kppeler @xcite data and are in better agreement with the preliminary results of the cologne group @xcite .",
    "we have argued that in the case of a reaction with strongly fluctuating cross section it is more useful for astrophysical applications to measure thick target yield than differential cross section with thin targets . without the intermediate step of cross section determination",
    "we have derived astrophysical reaction rate for the @xmath2mo(p,@xmath0)@xmath3tc reaction . in the temperature range relevant for the @xmath0-process the reaction rate",
    "is predominantly determined by our experimental data .",
    "our new recommended reaction rates are about a factor of 2 lower than the rates provided by the non - smoker code which is widely used in astrophysical network calculations .",
