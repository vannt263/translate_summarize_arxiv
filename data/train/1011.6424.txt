    "these theories are argued to be conformal @xcite , a recent article is @xcite .",
    "the problem is that generically these sigma models are only known to have virasoro and finite - dimensional lie superalgebra symmetry , which is in most cases not sufficient to determine physical quantities as spectra and correlation functions .",
    "it is thus crucial to find more symmetry and to learn how to use it .",
    "the state of the art of sigma models on target superspace is that wzw models on supergroups are fairly well understood due to their kac - moody symmetry , see @xcite for bulk and @xcite for boundary models .",
    "the situation changes when kac - moody symmetry ceases to be present",
    ". then perturbative computations starting from the wzw model led to the computation of specific boundary spectra @xcite and current correlation functions @xcite . in both cases",
    "the vanishing of the killing form simplified the perturbative treatment .",
    "non - perturbatively one can single out some subsectors of the theory using the global symmetry and compute correlation functions of fields in these sectors in simpler models @xcite .",

    "they are classical integrable @xcitep@xmath6 case classical integrability of the non - sigma model part of the string theory was found in @xcite . ] .",
    "quantum integrability is tightly connected with yangian symmetry at the quantum level . in condensed matter physics in the case of the integer quantum hall effect as well as for disordered systems",

    "the nature of the yangian algebra is expected to be rather unusual .",
    "having a natural construction of the algebra as we provide it in this article should help understanding these special yangian superalgebras .",
    "reviews on ordinary yangians are @xcite .",
    "the present work is inspired by the following two developments .",
    "lscher found non - local charges in massive two - dimensional quantum field theory @xcite , which were then identified as yangian algebras by bernard @xcite .",
    "these methods were extended to wzw models on compact lie groups in @xcite .",
    "as conformal fields do not vanish at infinity the procedure depends on a point of reference @xmath7 .",
    "the second development is twistor string theory .",
    "it is argued to be dual to n=4 super yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "amplitudes in super yang - mills are computed to be yangian invariant @xcite .",
    "the world - sheet theory of the open twistor string is essentially a free field representation of the psl(4@xmath04 ) current algebra at level one . using the methods of @xcite one",
    "can then establish yangian symmetry @xcite .",
    "the procedure simplifies considerably due to the vanishing of the killing form of psl(4@xmath04 ) , e.g. the dependence on the point of reference @xmath7 eventually vanishes .",
    "the main goal is to generalize this result and to establish yangian symmetry in many conformal field theories based on superalgebras with vanishing killing form and not necessarily possessing kac - moody current symmetry .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "we consider lie superalgebras whose killing form vanishes identically and which possess a non - degenerate invariant bilinear form .",
    "this applies to the algebras of the groups psl(n@xmath0n ) , osp(2n+2@xmath02n ) and d(2,1;@xmath1 ) .",
    "the first step is to take a conformal field theory with current symmetry of such a lie superalgebra .",
    "these currents are then used to construct non - local currents and charges , which depend on a point of reference @xmath7 .",
    "their properties are computed in complete analogy to the psl(4@xmath04 ) level one example of the twistor string @xcite .",
    "the first result is that a special subsector of the conformal field theory carries a representation of the yangian , given by the action of these non - local charges .",
    "moreover this is a symmetry and gives interesting ward identities .",
    "these identities are independent of the point of reference @xmath7 .",
    "this leads us to define new charges which also provide a yangian symmetry of this special subsector of the model .",
    "the new charges allow us to investigate truly marginal perturbations that preserve the yangian symmetry .",
    "we then list three examples .",
    "the main one are sigma models on the supergroups psl(n@xmath0n ) , osp(2n+2@xmath02n ) and d(2,1;@xmath1 ) .",

    "@xmath188 and @xmath189 has yangian symmetry .",
    "we have found yangian symmetry in a subsector of many conformal field theories with global superalgebra symmetry .",
    "the underlying lie superalgebra has the crucial property that its killing form vanishes identically .",
    "our derivation was divided into several steps .",
    "the starting point was a conformal field theory that possesses kac - moody current symmetry .",
    "non - local charges depending on a point @xmath7 were constructed in terms of these currents and their properties were computed .",
    "the crucial result was that correlation functions of primaries in the subsector @xmath102 , that allows for trivial lifts to yangian representation , obey the ward identity .",
    "this identity is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "this observation led us to define new charges that are again a symmetry for the subsector @xmath102 due to the ward identity .",
    "then perturbations that preserve this yangian but not the kac - moody symmetry were considered .",
    "finally , we gave some examples .",
    "we also derived a first order formulation for @xmath2 sigma models .",
    "there are several open questions .",
    "the apparent problem is to understand which representation of the lie superalgebra can be lifted trivially to a representation of the yangian , i.e. to identify the subsector of the conformal field theory having yangian symmetry . once knowing these representation one should search for solutions to the ward identities and classify them .",
    "we hope that they constrain correlation functions severely .",
    "the list of examples can certainly be extended , e.g. one could search for massive deformations , one can apply it to world - sheet supersymmetric supergroup wzw models @xcite .",
    "also our method applies to the current - current deformations recently studied in @xcite in this case for the disc as world - sheet . here",
    "it would be interesting to understand how the yangian symmetry is preserved by current - current perturbations according to the quadratic casimir for the sphere as world - sheet .",
    "i am very grateful to louise dolan for regular discussions and helpful comments .",
    "i also would like to thank brendan mclellan for discussions on yangian superalgebras and their representations , and peter rnne , till bargheer , dmitri sorokin , cosmas zachos and jan plefka for their comments .",
