    "for the case with papasimakis  _ et  al .",
    "_ graphene , two fairly sharp absorption peaks are found : the lower - frequency one at , marked as `` @xmath35 , '' comes from the so - called magneto - electric coupling to the magnetic dipole mode , which generates a magnetic dipole along the @xmath36 direction .",

    "for the case of yan  _ et  al .",
    "_ graphene , we also find two absorption peaks corresponding to the same modes ( `` @xmath39 '' and `` @xmath40 '' ) in the frequency range of interest , but both resonances are now weaker due to higher dissipative loss .",
    "we also observe that both resonances are blue - shifted compared to those in the papasimakis  _ et  al .",
    "_ graphene case .",
    "this is because of the higher doping and the resulting lower _ kinetic inductance _",
    "@xmath41 of the yan  _ et  al .",
    "_ graphene samples . when we consider the case of li",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "graphene in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we observe that the resonances are highly damped due to the high dissipative loss in the sample .",
    "the absorption peak `` @xmath42 '' is very shallow with a tiny amplitude of the order of magnitude of @xmath43 and we have checked that it is the electric dipole mode ; a spectral feature for the magnetic dipole mode is vaguely seen as a very tiny bump , marked as `` @xmath44 . '' the significant redshift of the resonance frequencies in the li  _ et  al .",
    "_ graphene case is indeed expected from the smaller @xmath3 value leading to much higher kinetic inductance .",
    "one very appealing finding for all graphene cases is that the magnetic dipole mode , occurring at around , is deeply subwavelength , with a @xmath45 ratio as high as 50 , and even for the electric dipole mode at higher frequency , @xmath45 still reaches a value of about 19 .",
    "this finds its origin in the huge _ kinetic inductance _ of graphene , which dominates over the geometric inductance in the setup under consideration .",
    "this is very interesting for the construction of metamaterials , because it allows to work deep in the effective - medium limit and to avoid periodicity artifacts .    for gold srrs under normal incidence as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the kinetic inductance ( @xmath46 ) is much smaller compared to graphene , and it is usually the geometric inductance that dominates .",
    "thus , it is expected that both the magnetic and the electric dipole modes would occur at much higher frequencies if the in - plane dimension were left unaltered . since the resonance frequency can be estimated by @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath48 is the geometric inductance and @xmath49 the capacitance , there are two different strategies to achieve the same resonance frequencies as in the graphene case discussed above : the first is to increase the capacitance dramatically so as to compensate the significant difference in kinetic inductance between gold and graphene .",
    "this would , however , require a tiny ring gap that would most likely be unachievable in an experiment .",
    "the second way is to increase the dimension of the srrs in order to achieve a much larger magnetic inductance .",
    "this is experimentally easier to achieve , but it sacrifices the deep subwavelength dimensions of the metamaterial unit . here",
    "we take the second strategy and the results shown in figs .",
    "1(c)-(d ) and 2(g)-(h ) are to be compared with the results for the graphene srrs .",
    "it should be noted that essentially such a comparison it is not very fair because the change in the dimensions of the srrs leads to significant difference in the coupling strength for both cases .",
    "however , the comparison still provides us some guidance towards the performance of graphene- and gold - based metamaterials .     and gold srrs [ ( d)-(f ) ] under parallel - incidence illumination .",

    "1 . benefiting from the increased in - plane dimension ,",
    "the geometric inductance of the srrs is able to compensate the difference in kinetic inductance between graphene and gold and the resonance frequencies for the lowest two modes , i.e. , the magnetic dipole mode ( @xmath56 ) and the electric dipole mode ( @xmath57 ) , are 3.1 and [ see the absorption spectrum in fig .  1(d ) ] , comparable to those of the graphene srr metamaterials . due to the low dissipative loss in gold , we see that the two resonances of the gold srrs are stronger than those in the graphene cases .",

    "1(d ) are shown in figs .",
    "2(g ) and ( h ) , respectively .",
    "they confirm the nature of the two resonant modes . from the above comparison between graphene- and gold - based srrs under normal incidence",
    ", we can conclude that graphene metamaterials are superior in the property of deep sub - wavelengthness due to the huge kinetic inductance of graphene .",
    "however , the high dissipative loss in graphene dampens the strength of the resonances even with the high - quality graphene by yan and co - workers .",
    "nevertheless , the electric dipole resonance of graphene metamaterials is still surprisingly strong and is potentially useful in the applications of terahertz wave manipulation ( see the discussions in part v ) .",
    "subsequently , we consider graphene - based and gold - based srrs under parallel incidence , as schematically illustrated in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the rings are embedded in a dielectric spacer made from a polymer @xcite with dielectric constant @xmath58 and oriented to avoid magneto - electric coupling , so that we can focus on the magnetic response purely induced by the external magnetic field . for graphene , we use only the experimental data by yan  _ et  al . _ in this section , since they are more realistic than theoretical models and bear much lower loss than li  _ et  al . _ data . to increase the strength of the magnetic resonance to some extent ,",
    "we adopt larger srrs with diameter @xmath50 , lattice constant @xmath53 , ring width @xmath59 and gap size @xmath60 for both the graphene and gold cases .",
    "the increased area of the graphene srr results in a stronger induced electromotive force and , hence , in a larger magnetic moment and stronger resonances .",
    "indeed , the non - planar configuration ( under parallel incidence ) , provides a fairer comparison between graphene and gold srrs , since this geometry allows having both types of srrs with approximately the same dimensions , so that the coupling strength to the magnetic dipole mode , which is proportional to the area of the srr , is also approximately the same for both . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the magnetic response for several separation distances between the rings ( @xmath55 varying from down to ) , which is the physical limit for the gold case , i.e. , the separated gold srrs become `` split tubes '' when @xmath55 decreases to [ see fig .",

    "_ graphene srrs . with decreasing @xmath55 ,",
    "the magnetic resonance of the graphene srrs is gradually strengthened , but even for @xmath61 , it is still not strong enough for the effective permeability to reach negative values .",
    "one may notice that the resonance frequency ( under parallel illumination ) is close to that in the normal - incidence case , even though the rings have much smaller dimensions .",
    "this is due to an increased geometric inductance to compensate for the altered capacitance in the case of parallel incidence on the stack of graphene srrs .    in comparison ,",
    "the magnetic resonance of gold srrs is very strong , rendering sharp absorption peaks [ fig .",
    "3(e ) ] and negative permeability [ fig .",
    "3(f ) ] for all cases with @xmath55 decreasing from 100 to .",
    "we find that , due to the densely packed srrs along the direction of magnetic field ( @xmath31 axis ) , the geometric inductance is dramatically increased and dominates over the kinetic inductance . therefore , the geometric inductance and distributed capacitance of the srrs determine the frequency of the magnetic resonance .",
    "this is confirmed by the inset of fig .",
    "3(e ) , which shows the relation between the resonance frequency and the ring separation @xmath55 for gold srrs .",
    "the low dissipative loss in gold helps gold srrs to exhibit superior performance in resonance strength over the graphene srrs .",
    "= 10 , 20 , 30 nm.,width=14 ]    however , for the parallel - incidence configuration , we can pack the graphene srrs even denser , which may lead to further stronger magnetic resonance .",
    "figures  4(a ) and ( b ) show the absorption spectrum and retrieved effective permeability for @xmath55 being and together with the case for from fig .  3 as a reference .",
    "as expected , the strength of the magnetic resonance keeps increasing with decreased @xmath55 , and for @xmath62 a negative effective permeability can be achieved . further decreasing",
    "the separation between neighbouring graphene srrs below would make the magnetic resonance even stronger , but it would also severely challenge the fabrication . in supplementary note ii,@xcite we present the absorption spectra and retrieved effective @xmath63 for srrs made from several previously listed graphene samples with @xmath64 nm , so from the results , we can see how @xmath3 and @xmath4 of graphene determines the performance of srrs under parallel incidence .",
    "so far , we have performed a number of comparisons between graphene and gold srr metamaterials for both normal- and parallel - incidence geometries ( some brief discussions about comparison between graphene and gold cut - wire metamaterials are shown in supplementary note iii @xcite ) .",
    "we revealed that the huge kinetic inductance of graphene allows to achieve resonant response in the deep sub - wavelength limit under normal incidence when the kinetic inductance dominates .",
    "however , the high dissipative loss of state - of - the - art graphene samples limits the strength of the metamaterial resonances . on the other hand",
    ", we should always keep in mind that the most appealing advantage of graphene over noble metals is its tunable electrical properties . in view of our discussions",
    "above , we find that graphene metamaterials do show surprisingly strong electric dipole resonances , despite the fairly high dissipative loss in graphene .",
    "therefore , it is advantageous to utilize these tunable electric resonance to create thz modulators .",
    "in fact , relating to graphene - aided tunable devices , a lot of efforts have been poured by worldwide researchers . for example , bludov _ et al .",

    ", we now pattern graphene films intocut - wire \" constituents , which possess an electric dipole resonance with even better response .",
    "the length of the cut wires is and their width is , arranged periodically with lattice constants along the @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions being 3 and , respectively .",
    "the cut wires are connected with each other via -wide thin strips of graphene .",
    "because of the large inductance of the connecting strips at high frequencies , they will not affect the terahertz response of the cut wires .",
    "the patterned graphene layers are stacked together with 20 nm - thick polymer as spacing materials , so that the configurations are compatible with the technology employed in the experimental work of refs .",
    "23 and 36 . in our study , the polymer spacer has dielectric constant @xmath65 and some loss is taken into account through a loss tangent @xmath66 .",
    "@xcite some further investigations into the influence of spacer loss on our thz modulators are presented in supplementary note iv.@xcite the thin graphene strips of even and odd layers are connected to electrodes of opposite voltages , providing the alternating sheets in the graphene stack with electron and hole doping , respectively .",
    "this device avoids the need for complicated top or back electrodes , in this way easing the fabrication .",
    "more importantly , benefiting from the multi - layer stack configuration , the design increases the carrier density and conductivity in the system dramatically,@xcite and therefore , the device shows very satisfying performance in tunability .",
    "figures 5(b)-(d ) show the results of simulations for configurations of 2-layer , 4-layer , and 6-layer patterned graphene stack . in the simulations , we still apply the realistic experimental data of yan _ et al .",
    "_ graphene for the biased case ( i.e. , graphene being heavily _ _",
    "p-__doped ) . on the other hand ,",
    "relating to the data of graphene for the unbiased case , a reasonable estimation is made according to the experimental measurements to graphene in thz by horng _",
    "et al._,@xcite in which , it is shown that , for the hole doping regime , @xmath4 value is more or less constant independent of gate voltage , but at the electron doping side , @xmath4 increases approximately by 1/2 at highest doping level comparing to that at around charge - neutral point ( lightly doping ) .",
    "therefore , we take the data set of @xmath67 for the unbiased graphene in our study , and for the highest electron doping level , graphene is modeled with @xmath68 .",
    "the simulations show that , the tuning efficiency of a 2-layer stack reaches about @xmath69 and for a device of 6-layer graphene stack with only thick , it can modulate over @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , we have compared the performance of graphene and gold when used in the design of metamaterials in the terahertz domain .",
    "the huge kinetic inductance of graphene results in promising deep subwavelength metamaterial resonances , but the resonances are relatively weaker due to the higher dissipative loss compared to gold . densely packed graphene srrs are found to exhibit quite strong magnetic resonances possibly possessing negative permeability , but their performance is not as good as gold srrs . however , graphene@xmath70with its easily tunable electrical properties@xmath70definitely provides significant advantages for tunable metamaterials over gold , especially in achieving miniaturized switchable devices .",
