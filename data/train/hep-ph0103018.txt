    "if we assume the integrated luminosity per year to be at its design value of @xmath202  fb@xmath200 for each of the two lhc experiments , atlas and cms , then this translates into a maximum of 20.000 to 200.000 events per year for each of these signal processes .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the background processes competing with the @xmath48 signals at the lhc lies beyond the scope of our study .",
    "however , we should briefly mention them and quote the relevant literature . without specifying the decay channels of the @xmath69 bosons ,",
    "one expects the major backgrounds to arise from the pair production of neutral gauge bosons , the associate production of a neutral gauge boson and a neutral higgs boson , and the continuum production of the respective @xmath136 decay products .",
    "published signal - to - background analyses @xcite have concentrated on the @xmath203 signals and their irreducible continuum backgrounds , due to the partonic subprocesses @xmath204 , which are dominantly of pure qcd origin .",
    "it has been demonstrated that , after optimizing the acceptance cuts , the lhc experiments might discover a signal , with experimental significance in excess of 5 , if @xmath205 or @xmath206 .",
