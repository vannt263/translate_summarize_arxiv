    "folded states of globular proteins , which are evolved ( slightly ) branched heteropolymers made from twenty amino acids , are roughly spherical and are nearly maximally compact with high packing densities @xcite . despite achieving high packing densities in the folded states ,",
    "globular proteins tolerate large volume substitutions while retaining the native fold  @xcite .",
    "this is explained in a couple of interesting theoretical studies  @xcite , which demonstrated that there is sufficient free volume in the folded state to accommodate mutations .",
    "collectively these and related studies show that folded proteins are compact .",
    "when they unfold , which can be achieved upon addition of high concentrations of denaturants ( or applying a mechanical force ) , they swell adopting expanded conformations . the radius of gyration ( @xmath0 ) of a folded globular protein is well described by the flory law with @xmath8 @xmath9  @xcite , whereas in the swollen state @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an effective monomer size and the flory exponent @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus , viewed from this perspective we could surmise that proteins must undergo a coil - to - globule transition @xcite , a process that is reminiscent of the well characterized equilibrium collapse transition in homopolymers @xcite .",
    "the latter is driven by the interplay of conformational entropy and intra - polymer interaction energy resulting in the collapsed globular state .",
    "the swollen state is realized in good solvents ( interaction between monomer and solvents is favorable ) whereas in the collapsed state monomer - monomer interactions are preferred .",
    "the coil - to - globule transition in large homopolymers is akin to a phase transition .",
    "the temperature at which the interactions between the monomers roughly balance monomer - solvent energetics is the @xmath13 temperature . by analogy",
    ", we may identify high ( low ) denaturant concentrations with good ( poor ) solvent for proteins .    despite the expected similarities between the equilibrium collapse transition in homopolymers and the compaction of proteins",
    ", it is still debated whether the unfolded states of proteins are more compact under folding conditions compared to their states at high denaturant concentrations .",
    "if polypeptide chain compaction is universal , is collapse in proteins essentially the same phenomenon as in hompolymer collapse or is it driven by a different mechanism @xcite ?",
    "surprisingly , this fundamental question in the protein folding field has not been answered satisfactorily  @xcite . in order to explain the plausible difficulties in quantifying the extent of compaction ,",
    "let us consider a protein , which undergoes an apparent two - state transition from an unfolded ( swollen ) to a folded ( compact ) state as the denaturant concentration ( @xmath14 ) is decreased . at the concentration , @xmath15 , the populations of the folded and unfolded states are equal .",
    "a vexing question , which has been difficult to unambiguously answer in experiments , is : what is the size , @xmath0 , of the unfolded state under folding conditions ( @xmath16 ) ?",
    "small angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) experiments on some proteins show practically no change in the unfolded @xmath0 as @xmath14 is changed  @xcite . on the other hand , from experiments based on single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( smfret ) it has been concluded that the size of the unfolded state is more compact below @xmath15 compared to its value at high @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the so - called smfret - saxs controversy has remained unresolved .",
    "resolving this apparent controversy is not only important in our understanding of the physics of protein folding but also has implications for the physical basis of the evolution of natural sequences .",
    "the difficulties in describing the collapse of unfolded states as @xmath14 is lowered could be attributed to the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) following de gennes  @xcite , homopolymer collapse can be pictured as formation of a large number of blobs driven by local interactions between monomers on the scale of the blob size .",
    "coarsening of blobs results in the equilibrium globule formation with the number of maximally compact conformations whose number scales exponentially with the number of monomers .",
    "other scenarios resulting in the formation of fractal globules enroute to the formation of equilibrium maximally collapsed structures have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the globule formation is driven by non - specific interactions between the monomers or the blobs .",
    "regardless of how the equilibrium globule is reached it is clear that it is largely stabilized by local interactions , because contacts between monomers that are distant along the sequence are entropically unfavorable .",
    "in contrast , even in high denaturant concentrations proteins could have residual structure , which likely becomes prominent at @xmath16 . at low @xmath14",
    "there are specific favorable interactions between residues separated by a few or several residues along the sequence .",
    "as their strength grows , with respect to the entropic forces , the specific interactions may favor compaction in a manner different from the way non - specific local interactions induce homopolymer collapse .",
    "in other words , the dominant native - like contacts also drive compaction of unfolded states of proteins .",
    "( 2 ) a consequence of the impact of the native - like contacts ( local and non - local ) on collapse of unfolded states is that specific energetic considerations dictate protein compaction resulting in the formation of minimum energy compact structures ( mecs )  @xcite .",
    "the number of mecs , which are not fully native , is small , scaling as @xmath17 with @xmath2 being the number of amino acid residues .",
    "therefore , below @xmath15 their contributions to @xmath0 have to be carefully dissected , which is more easily done in single molecule experiments than in ensemble measurements such as saxs .",
    "( 3 ) single domain proteins are finite - sized with @xmath2 rarely exceeding @xmath18 200 .",
    "most of those studied experimentally have @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the extent of change in @xmath0 of the unfolded states is predicted to be small , requiring high precision experiments to quantify the changes in @xmath0 as @xmath14 is changed .",
    "for example , in a recent study@xcite , we showed that in pdz2 domain the change in @xmath0 of the unfolded states as the denaturant concentration changes from 6 m guanidine chloride to 0 m is only about 8% .",
    "recent experiments have also established that changes in @xmath0 in helical proteins are not too large @xcite .    in homopolymers",
    "there are only two possible states , coil and globule , with a transition between the two occurring at @xmath20 . on the other hand , even in proteins",
    "that fold in a two - state manner one can conceive of at least three states ( we ignore intermediates here ) : ( i ) the unfolded state @xmath21 at high @xmath14 ; ( ii ) the compact but unfolded state @xmath22 , which could possibly exist below @xmath15 ; ( iii ) the native state .",
    "do the sizes of @xmath21 and @xmath22 differ ?",
    "this question requires a clear answer as it impacts our understanding of how proteins fold , because the very nature of the unfolded states of proteins plays a key role in determining protein foldability @xcite .",
    "given the flexibility of proteins ( persistence length on the order of @xmath23 nm ) , we expect that the size of the extended polypeptide chain must gradually decrease as the solvent quality is altered .",
    "experiments on a number of proteins show that this is the case  @xcite .",
    "however , in some saxs experiments the theoretical expectation that @xmath24 for one protein was not borne out @xcite , precipitating a more general question : are chemically denatured proteins compact at low @xmath14 ?",
    "the absence of collapse is not compatible with inferences based on smfret @xcite and theory @xcite . here",
    ", we create a theory to not only resolve the smfret - saxs controversy but also provide a quantitative description of how the propensity to be compact is encoded in the native topology .",
    "the theory , based on polymer physics concepts , includes specific attractive interactions ( mimicking interactions accounting for native contacts in the protein data bank ( pdb ) ) and a two - body excluded volume repulsion . by construction",
    "the model does not have a native state .",
    "there are only two states ( analogues of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) in the model .",
    "the formation of @xmath22 is driven by the contact map of the folded state . thus",
    ", chain compaction is driven in much the same way as in homopolymers , altered only by specific interactions that differentiate proteins from homopolymers .",
    "our theory predicts quantitatively how the extent of compaction ( collapsibility ) is determined by the strength and the number of the native contacts and their locations along the chain .",
    "we use a large representative selection of proteins from the pdb to establish that collapsibility is an inherent characteristic of evolved protein sequences .",
    "a major outcome of this work is that @xmath6-sheet proteins are far more collapsible than structures dominated by @xmath7-helices .",
    "our theory suggests that there is an evolutionary pressure on proteins for being compact as a pre - requisite for kinetic foldability , as we predicted over twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "we come to the inevitable conclusion that the unfolded state of proteins must be compact under native conditions , and the mechanism of polypeptide chain compaction has similarities as well as differences to collapse in homopolymers . as a by - product of this work",
    "we also establish that certain non - coding rna molecules must undergo compaction prior to folding as their folded structures are stabilized predominantly by long - range tertiary contacts .",
    "we start with an edwards hamiltonian for a polymer chain  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the position of the monomer @xmath27 , @xmath28 the monomer size , and @xmath2 is the number of monomers . the first term in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) accounts for chain connectivity , and the second term represents volume interactions and favorable interactions between select monomers given by @xmath29 ,    @xmath30    the first term in eq.([hamiltv ] ) accounts for the homopolymer ( non - specific ) two - body interactions .",
    "it is well established in the theory of homopolymers that in good solvents with @xmath31 the polymer swells with @xmath32 @xmath33 . in poor solvents ( @xmath34 )",
    "the polymer undergoes a coil - globule transition with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "these are the celebrated flory laws . here",
    ", we consider only the excluded volume repulsion case ( @xmath37 ) .    the second term in eq.([hamiltv ] )",
    "requires an explanation .",
    "the generic scenario for homopolymer collapse is based on an observation by de gennes , who pictured the collapse process as being driven by the initial formation of blobs that arrange to form a sausage - like structure . at",
    "later stages the globule forms to maximize favorable intra - molecular contacts while simultaneously minimizing surface tension .",
    "compaction in proteins , although sharing many features in common with homopolymer collapse , could be different .",
    "a key difference is that the folded states of almost all proteins are stabilized by a mixture of local contacts ( interaction between residues separated by less than say @xmath18 8 but greater than 3 residues ) as well as non - local ( @xmath38 8 residues ) contacts .",
    "note that the demarcation using 8 between local and non - local contacts is arbitrary , and is not germane to the present argument .",
    "these specific interactions also dominate the enthalpy of formation of the compact , non - native state @xmath22 , playing an important role in its stability .",
    "therefore , the topology of the folded state could dictate collapsibility ( the extent to which the @xmath21 state becomes compact as the denaturant concentration is lowered ) of a given protein . in combination with the finite size of single domain proteins ( @xmath2 @xmath18 200 ) ,",
    "the extent of protein collapse could be small . in order to assess chain compaction under native conditions",
    "we should consider the second term in eq.([hamiltv ] ) .",
    "we note in passing ( with discussion to follow ) that a number of studies have considered the effect of crosslinks on the shape of polymer chains @xcite .",
    "polymers with crosslinks have served as models for polymer gels and rubber elasticity@xcite . in these studies",
    "the contacts were either random , leading to the random loop model @xcite , or explicit averages over the probability of realizing such contacts were made @xcite , as may be appropriate in modeling gels .",
    "these studies inevitably predict a coil - to - globule phase transition as the number of crosslinks increases .",
    "in contrast to models with random crosslinks , in our theory attraction is only between specific residues , described by the second term in eq.([hamiltv ] ) , where the sum is over the set of interactions ( native contacts ) involving pairs @xmath39 .",
    "we use the contact map of the protein ( extracted from the pdb structure ) in order to assign the specific interactions ( their total number being @xmath40 ) .",
    "the contact is assigned to any two residues @xmath41 and @xmath42 if the distance between their @xmath43 atoms in the pdb entry is less than @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we use gaussian potentials in order to have short ( but finite ) range attractive interactions . for the excluded volume repulsion ,",
    "this range is on the order of the size of the monomer , @xmath46 . for the specific attraction ,",
    "the range is the average distance in the pdb entry between @xmath43 atoms forming a contact ( averaged across a selection of proteins from the pbd ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 .    by changing the value of @xmath48 , and hence the strength of attraction",
    ", there is a transition between the extended and compact states .",
    "decreasing @xmath48 is analogous to chemically denaturing proteins , although the connection is not precise . at high denaturant concentrations ( @xmath49 , good solvent ) the excluded volume repulsion ( first term in eq.([hamiltv ] ) ) dominates the attraction , while at low @xmath14 ( high @xmath48 , poor solvent ) the attractive interactions are important .",
    "the point where attraction balances repulsion is the @xmath13-point , and the value of @xmath50 .",
    "although reserved for the coil - to - globule transition in the limit of @xmath51 in homopolymers , we will use the same notation ( @xmath13-point ) here . in our model , at the @xmath52-point , the chain behaves like an ideal chain . to describe the globular state",
    ", a three - body repulsion needs to be added to the hamiltonian ( eq.([hamiltv ] ) ) , but we focus on the region between the extended coil and the @xmath13-point because our interest is to access only the collapsibility of proteins",
    ". if @xmath53 is very large then significant chain compaction would only occur at very low ( @xmath54 ) denaturant concentrations , implying low propensity to collapse .",
    "conversely , small @xmath53 implies ease of collapsibility .",
    "note that the ground state ( @xmath55 ) of the hamiltonian in eq.([hamiltv ] ) is a collapsed chain whose @xmath0 is on the order of the monomer size .",
    "in other words , a stable native state does not exist for the model described in eq.([hamiltv ] ) .",
    "thus , we define protein collapse as the propensity of the polypeptide chain to reach the @xmath13-point as measured by the @xmath53 value , and use the changes in the radius of gyration @xmath56 as a measure of the extent of compaction .    * assessing collapsibility : * for our model , which encodes protein topology without favoring the folded state , we calculate @xmath57 using the edwards - singh ( es ) method @xcite .",

    "* rnas are compact : * there are major differences between how rna and proteins fold @xcite . in contrast to the apparent controversy in proteins , it is well established that rna molecules are compact@xcite at high ion concentrations or at low temperatures .",

    "the @xmath123 values ( green stars in fig.[fig : alphabeta ] ) are close to the lower @xmath6-sheet line , indicating that these molecules must undergo compaction .",
    "this prediction from the theory is fully supported by both equilibrium and time - resolved saxs experiments@xcite on _ azoarcus _ ribozyme . in this case ( @xmath124 ) the changes are so large that even using low resolution experiments collapse is readily observed@xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the size of different rnas ( for example viral , coding , non - coding ) vary greatly .",

    "although the sizes of the viral rnas considered in @xcite are much longer than the _ azoarcus _ ribozyme the notion that compaction is determined by the density of branching might be valid even when @xmath125 .",
    "we have shown that polymer chains with specific interactions , like proteins ( but ones without a unique native state ) , become compact as the strength of the specific interaction changes .",
    "a clear implication is that the size of the @xmath126 state should decrease continuously as @xmath14 decreases . in other words ,",
    "the unfolded state under folding conditions is more compact than it is at high denaturant concentrations .",
    "compaction is driven roughly by the same mechanism as the collapse transition in homopolymers in the sense that when the solvent quality is poor ( below @xmath15 ) the size of the unfolded state decreases continuously .",
    "when the set of specific interactions is taken from protein native contacts in the pdb , our theory shows that the values of @xmath94 are in the range expected for interaction between amino acids in proteins .",
    "this implies that collapsibility should be a universal feature of foldable proteins but the extent of compaction varies greatly depending on the architecture in the folded state .",

    "magnitude of @xmath123 and plausible route to multi - domain formation : * the scaling of @xmath123 with @xmath2 allows us to provide arguments for the emergence of multi - domain proteins . in eqs.([self ] ) or ( [ ktheta ] ) attractive ( @xmath48- ) and repulsive ( @xmath82- ) terms have the same structure .",
    "the only difference in their scaling with @xmath2 is due to the difference in the sums ( over all the monomers in the repulsive term and over native contacts in the attractive term ) .",

    "the summation over native contacts in the attractive term scales as @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , to compensate for the repulsion , @xmath40 should scale as @xmath127 .",
    "however , for a given protein with a certain length @xmath2 and certain numbers of contacts , it is not clear how the denominator in eq.([ktheta ] ) scales with @xmath2 .",
    "empirically we find @xmath105 dependence across a representative set of sequences scales as @xmath128 with @xmath129 less than 2 ( likely on the order of 1.5 ) .",
    "thus , it follows from eq.([ktheta ] ) that @xmath94 increases without bound as @xmath2 continues to increase . because this is unphysical",

    "this argument in part explains why single domain proteins are relatively small@xcite .",
    "scaling of @xmath40 as a power law in @xmath128 with @xmath132 means that as protein size grows , the value of @xmath94 will deviate more and more from those found in globular proteins , implying such proteins can not be globally compact under physiologically relevant conditions .",
    "however , such an instability is not a problem because larger proteins typically consist of multiple domains .",
    "thus , if the protein does not show collapse as a whole , the individual domains could fold independently , having lower values of @xmath94 for each domain of the multi - domain protein .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the predicted onset of instability at @xmath130 provides a quantitative way to assess the mechanism of formation of multi - domain proteins .",
    "extension of the theory might yield interesting patterns in the assembly of multi - domain proteins .",

    "this conclusion is not only at variance with saxs experiments on other proteins but also with interpretation of smfret data on a number of proteins .",

    "we have previously argued that because the change in @xmath0 between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states for small proteins is not large , high precision experiments are needed to measure the predicted changes in @xmath0 between @xmath22 and @xmath21 . for protein -",
    "l the change is less than 10%@xcite , making its detection in ensemble experiments very difficult .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in recent experiments @xcite . a clear message from our theory is that , tempting as it may be , one can not draw universal conclusions about polypeptide compaction by performing experiments on just a few proteins .",
    "one has to survey a large number of proteins with varying @xmath2 and native topology to quantitatively assess the extent of compaction .",
    "our theory provides a framework for interpreting the results of such experiments .    * random contact maps , local and non - local contacts : * in order to differentiate collapsibility between evolved and random proteins , we created twelve random contact maps keeping the total number of contacts the same as in protein - l ( see fig.([fig : random72 ] ) for examples ) . for each of these pseudo - proteins we calculated @xmath123 using eq.([ktheta ] ) .",
    "we find that for all the random contact maps the @xmath123 values are less than for protein - l , implying that the propensity of the pseudo - proteins to become compact is greater than for the wild type .",

    "these studies showed that the polymer undergoes a collapse transition as the density of crosslinks is increased  @xcite .",
    "of particular note is the demonstration by camacho and schanke  @xcite , who showed using exact enumeration of random heteropolymers and scaling arrangements that the collapse can be either a first or second order transition depending on the function of hydrophobic residues @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed , using monte carlo simulations of protein - like lattice polymers , that the folding transition in proteins with predominantly non - local contacts was first order like , which is not the case for proteins in which local contacts dominate . in light of this finding , it is interesting to examine how compaction is affected by local and non - local contacts .",
    "we created for @xmath2=72 ( protein - l ) a contact map with 185 ( same number as with wt",

    "interestingly , @xmath94 values in this case are significantly less than for the wt .",

    "such a balance is needed to achieve native state stability and speed of folding@xcite with polypeptide compaction playing an integral part @xcite .    based on these findings",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 of the unfolded states of proteins dominated by non - local contacts must undergo greater compaction compared to those with that have mostly local contacts . the results in fig .",
    "3 also show that proteins rich in @xmath6-sheet are more collapsible than predominantly @xmath7-helical proteins .",

    "( 8c ) and the predictions in fig .",
    "we have created a theory to assess collapsibility of proteins .",

    "( i ) because single domain proteins are small , the changes in the radius of gyration of the unfolded states as the denaturant concentration is lowered are often small .",
    "thus , it has been difficult to detect the changes in saxs experiments in a couple of proteins raising the question if unfolded polypeptide chains become compact below @xmath15 . here",
    ", we have solved this long - standing problem showing that the unfolded states of single - domain proteins do become compact as the denaturant concentration decreases , sharing much in common with the physical mechanisms governing homopolymer collapse . by adopting concepts from polymer physics , and using the contact maps that reflect the topology of the native states , we established that proteins are collapsible .",
    "( ii ) based on a survey of over two thousand proteins we surmise that there is evolutionary pressure for collapsibility is universal although the extent of collapse can vary greatly , because this ensures that the propensity to aggregate is minimized even if environmental fluctuations under cellular conditions transiently populate unfolded states .",
    "two factors contribute to aggregation .",
    "first , the rate of dimer formation by diffusion controlled reaction would be enhanced if a pair of @xmath21 rather than @xmath22 molecules collided due cellular stress because the contact radius in the former would be greater than in the latter .",
    "second , the fraction of exposed hydrophobic resides in @xmath21 is much greater than in @xmath22 , thus greatly increasing the probability of aggregation .",
    "the second factor is likely to be more important than the first .",
    "consequently , transient population of @xmath22 due to cellular stress minimizes the probability of aggregation .",
    "( iii ) we have also shown that the position of the residues forming the native contact greatly influences the collapsibility of @xmath6 sheet proteins ( containing a number of non - local contacts showing greater compaction than @xmath7 helical proteins , which are typically stabilized by local contacts .",
    "our theory also shows that most rnas may have evolved to be compact in their natural environments .",
    "although the evolutionary pressure to be compact is likely to be substantial for viral rnas @xcite , it is apparent that even non - coding rnas are also likely to be almost maximally compact in their natural environments .",
    "our theory suggests that , to a large extent , collapsibility of rna is similar to proteins with @xmath6-sheet structures .",
    "both classes of biological macromolecules are stabilized by non - local contacts .",
