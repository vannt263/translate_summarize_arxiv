    "one of the most important objectives in the study of dilute gases , has been the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in bosonic systems .",
    "indeed , decades of experimental research finally lead two years ago to the observation of bec in three different systems of alkali metal gases @xmath1rb , @xmath2li and @xmath3na @xcite .",
    "this success has triggered a large amount of interest in the field of ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "although the study of properties of these degenerate atomic bose gases is vigorously being pursued at the moment , trapping and cooling of fermi gases might also provide new and exciting physics .",
    "indeed , in a previous theoretical study we showed that a gas of spin - polarized atomic @xmath0li becomes superfluid at densities and temperatures comparable with those at which the bose - einstein experiments are performed @xcite .",
    "this superfluid phase transition , which is similar to the bcs transition in a superconductor , occurs at such high temperatures due to the fact that @xmath0li has an anomalously large and negative ( triplet ) @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this scattering length is a measure for the interatomic interactions , and its sign implies that this interaction is effectively attractive , which is a first requirement for a bcs transition to occur . for other atomic species ,",
    "the transition temperature is in general very low , because of the fact that the scattering length is of the order of the range of the interaction @xmath6  and the diluteness of the gas requires that the fermi wavenumber @xmath7 .",
    "so for example in the case of deuterium , it was concluded already some time ago that the observation of a bcs transition is experimentally impossible @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0li atom has nuclear spin @xmath8 , and electron spin @xmath9 .",
    "consequently the atom has six hyperfine states @xmath10  to @xmath11 , for which the level splitting in a magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "the upper three levels @xmath12  to @xmath11  can be trapped in a static magnetic trap , whereas the lowest three hyperfine levels prefer high magnetic fields and are expelled from a magnetic field minimum .    the simplest way to create a degenerate",
    "fermi gas is to trap just one low - field seeking hyperfine state , and for the sake of stability of the gas , the doubly polarized state @xmath13  is most suitable .",
    "however , due to the pauli exclusion principle , two fermions in the same hyperfine state can interact with each other at best via @xmath14-waves , and if this interaction is effectively attractive , the onset of the formation of cooper pairs occurs at a temperature @xmath15 where @xmath16  is the fermi energy of the atomic gas , and @xmath5 the @xmath14-wave scattering length . for @xmath0li",
    "this @xmath14-wave scattering length of the triplet potential is approximately @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bohr radius , and @xmath19 in general . as a result",
    "the critical temperature for such a doubly spin polarized @xmath0li gas is extremely low . at present",
    ", a reasonable number for the density of trapped atomic gases is @xmath20@xmath21 , leading to @xmath22nk , and @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding critical temperature is clearly unattainable .    in the case",
    "that more than one state is trapped , baranov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite predicted a considerable increase in the above ( @xmath14-wave ) critical temperature as a result of the fact that two atoms in the same spin state can now also attract each other through the exchange of a phonon ( density fluctuation ) in another hyperfine state .",
    "it was found that in this case the transition temperature @xmath24 where @xmath5 now corresponds to the @xmath4-wave scattering length for collisions between the two hyperfine states . nevertheless , using again a density of @xmath20 @xmath21 for each spin state and the value @xmath25 for @xmath0li @xcite , we find that @xmath26 , and it is easily verified that also in this case the critical temperature is out of reach experimentally .    therefore , the most promising approach is to consider a cooper pair of two atoms in different hyperfine states , since then @xmath4-wave pairing is allowed . in this case",
    "@xcite @xmath27 resulting in a much higher critical temperature than in the previous two cases .",
    "in particular , we envision to trap @xmath0li atoms in the states @xmath11 and @xmath28 .",
    "experimentally , this might be achieved most easily by first trapping only one hyperfine level , and then applying a _ noisy _ rf - pulse to create an incoherent mixture of atoms occupying these two hyperfine levels @xcite .",
    "note that this situation has in fact already been realized in recent experiments with @xmath1rb atoms , although using a different technique @xcite .    in a recent publication modawi and leggett propose to trap @xmath0li atoms in three instead of two hyperfine states @xcite .",
    "the advantage in such a system is that the effect of fluctuations is reduced somewhat , but the disadvantage of trapping more hyperfine states , is that the number of channels by which the gas can decay increases considerably .",
    "there are not only more possibilities for two - body collision processes , in which one or two electron spins are flipped and the corresponding atoms are expelled from the trap , but also three - body recombination processes are now no longer suppressed . therefore , at present , it seems to be most favorable to trap only two hyperfine states , and the most suitable candidates are the states @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , because for this combination the decay processes due to two - body interactions can be suppressed most .",
    "the approximate sign in the last expression indicates that in the state @xmath28 there is for @xmath31 a small admixture with the spin state @xmath32 .",
    "although this admixture can be neglected for most purposes , we come back to its importance for the stability of the gas shortly .",
    "as explained above , in a two - component spin - polarized atomic @xmath0li gas , cooper pairing will occur only between atoms in different spinstates , while there is almost no interaction between two atoms in the same spin states . for notational simplicity",
    ", we also refer to these states as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the densities of atoms in these two hyperfine states are denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "notice that since the two states are electron spin - polarized , the strength of the interatomic interaction is indeed characterized by the @xmath4-wave scattering length of the triplet potential @xmath37 , and it is exactly this number which is anomalously large and negative in the case of @xmath0li .    the aim of the present publication is threefold .",
    "first , the homogeneous calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite needs some improvement , due to the fact that the interatomic interaction potential for @xmath0li has recently been determined more accurately @xcite .",
    "the most up - to - date value of the @xmath4-wave scattering length is @xmath38 , where @xmath18  is the bohr radius .",
    "this change in @xmath5  not only affects the critical temperature but also the decay rates of the gas .",
    "second , we want to take the effect of the inhomogeneity of the trapped gas into account , and in the third place , we look for a signature that signals the presence of the superfluid phase in the gas .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rates ] , we consider in some detail the decay processes limiting the lifetime of the gas .",
    "subsequently , we briefly summarize the theory for the homogeneous fermi gas in sec .",
    "[ bcstransition ]  and improve the results obtained earlier for the critical temperature , using the most up - to - date interatomic potential for @xmath0li . in sec",
    ".  [ stability ]  we consider the mechanical stability of a weakly interacting fermi gas .",
    "in particular we also consider a gas with positive @xmath4-wave scattering length , and show that in the unstable part of the phase diagram , a spinodal decomposition can restore the stability of the gas in this case .    in future experiments the atoms are likely to be trapped in an external potential that roughly has the shape of an isotropic harmonic oscillator @xmath39 , and which causes the gas cloud to be inhomogeneous .",
    "therefore , the last part of this paper is devoted to the study of an inhomogeneous two - component fermi gas at and below the critical temperature , and in particular we will again concentrate on @xmath0li .",
    "the numerical calculations will be performed in the local density approximation , which is valid if the correlation length @xmath40  over which the particles influence each other is much smaller than the typical trap size @xmath41  over which the density of the gas changes .",
    "a similar calculation for the noninteracting case has been performed recently by butts and rokhsar @xcite .",
    "in addition , the case of purely repulsive interactions has been studied by oliva in the same way in the context of possible experiments with spin - polarized atomic deuterium @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ lda ] , we briefly repeat the ingredients for the local density approximation . in sec .  [ tc ] we calculate the critical temperature of the gas as a function of the number of trapped atoms , and in sec .  [ benedentc ] we study the gas in the superfluid state . density profiles for the gas as well as for the bcs order parameter are presented . in sec .",
    "[ conclusie ]  we devote a discussion to the issue of how to detect the superfluid phase and to distinguish it from the normal phase .",
    "we end the paper with a summary of the main conclusions .",
    "we first consider a homogeneous , dilute gas of ( electron ) spin - polarized @xmath0li atoms .",
    "since the gas is dilute , the atoms will interact with each other mainly through two - body collisions .",
    "these two - body collisions can be represented on the mean - field level by a local potential with a strength given by the two - body scattering matrix @xmath42 , where @xmath43  is the mass of the particles and @xmath5  is the scattering length @xcite .",
    "the sign of @xmath5 determines whether the two - body interaction is effectively repulsive ( @xmath44 ) , or attractive ( @xmath45 ) .    before going to a description of the gas in the normal and superfluid state",
    ", we consider an aspect that is experimentally of some importance , namely the lifetime of the gas .",
    "the large @xmath4-wave scattering length has on the one hand the advantage of having many thermalizing collisions between the particles which is required for efficient evaporative cooling , but on the other hand there will also be relatively many inelastic collisions which can cause spin - flips within the atoms . if the electron spin of an atom is inverted , the atom will be lost from the trap , and consequently these inelastic processes limit the lifetime of the gas . in the next subsection",
    "we explain in more detail which decay processes dominate in a mixture of @xmath0li atoms in the hyperfine states @xmath11 and @xmath28 .",
    "the electron spin and nuclear spin quantum numbers of the two trapped hyperfine levels for @xmath31 are given by @xmath46 is inversely proportional to the applied magnetic field @xmath47 , so for sufficiently strong magnetic fields the admixture of @xmath48 with the high - field seeking part is small and the gas can considered to be electron spin - polarized . for such large magnetic fields ,",
    "the energies of these two hyperfine levels are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "since the two atoms in state @xmath28 and @xmath11 will interact at the low temperatures of interest solely via @xmath4-wave scattering , implying that the spatial part of the two - body wave function is symmetric under the exchange of atoms , the spin part of the wave function must be anti - symmetric , i.e. @xmath51 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & |11;11\\rangle + \\theta^+|00;22\\rangle , \\label{totalspin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last line we used the basis @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the total electron and nuclear spin of the two colliding atoms , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 the corresponding magnetic quantum numbers along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the decay rates for the transition from the state @xmath57 with orbital quantum numbers @xmath58 and @xmath43 to a state @xmath59 with quantum numbers @xmath60 and @xmath61 , is essentially given by fermi s golden rule and results in the expression @xcite @xmath62 for the zero - temperature limit of the rate constant for this process . here",
    "@xmath63 is the two - body scattering matrix at zero energy such that the incoming particles have zero relative momentum , and the magnitude of the relative momentum of the scattered particles is @xmath64 .    as was explained for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are basically two ways in which collisions cause the atoms to be lost from the trap .",
    "first of all , the central ( singlet and triplet ) interaction @xmath65  induces transitions between different hyperfine levels . since this interaction can not change the total electron or nuclear spin angular momentum , and the hyperfine level @xmath28  has a small admixture with the state @xmath66 , only transitions @xmath67 , where @xmath68  are allowed .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( [ totalspin ] ) , the total spin state @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 combining eqs .",
    "( [ totalspin ] ) and ( [ totalspin61 ] ) , we find that the spin part of the transition matrix @xmath71   contributes a factor @xmath72 times the exchange potential @xmath73 , i.e.  the difference between the triplet and singlet potential .",
    "to calculate the spatial part , we must use for the relative in- and outcoming scattering wave functions with orbital quantum numbers @xmath58 and @xmath43 and total electron spin @xmath74 the normalized expression @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the in- and outcoming solutions to the radial schrdinger equation with the singlet or triplet interaction . using furthermore that the relative momentum @xmath77 after scattering is due to the energy difference @xmath78 , we find that @xmath79 . combining all expressions into eq .",
    "( [ generalrate ] ) , we obtain that the rate constant due to exchange interactions is given by @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] this exchange rate as a function of the magnetic field is shown ( curve 1 ) .",
    "the second way in which collisions cause decay of the gas is due to magnetic dipolar interactions @xmath81 .",
    "as will be shown , of the various dipolar interactions , the contribution due to electron - electron dipolar interactions is most important .",
    "for this dipolar interaction , we have @xcite @xmath82 where the tensor operator @xmath83 can be thought of as arising from the coupling between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the pauli spin matrices describing the electron spin of the two atoms , to a tensor of rank 2 . for the scattering state @xmath86",
    ", the dipolar interaction can change the ( total ) electron spin projection @xmath55  of the two atoms by an amount @xmath87 for a one spin - flip ( 1sf ) , or @xmath88 for a two spin - flip ( 2sf ) process .",
    "therefore , the one ( two ) spin - flip dipolar interaction couples the incoming wave function with approximately @xmath89 to the final state having @xmath90 . as a result ,",
    "the outgoing wave function is in the state @xmath91 for one spin - flip , and in the total spin - state @xmath92 after the two spin - flip interaction .",
    "the clebsch - gordon coefficients for each process are given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , i.e.  the spin part of the transition matrix contributing to the decay rate is a factor of @xmath95 larger for the two spin - flip process than for the one spin - flip process .",
    "moreover , the energy released in a one spin - flip process is only half of the energy released in a two spin - flip process .",
    "therefore we find that @xmath96  whereas @xmath97 .",
    "we thus arrive at the convenient relation that @xmath98  and it suffices to calculate only the one spin - flip decay rate .",
    "performing a similar calculation as in the case of the exchange decay rates , the one spin - flip decay rate becomes @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the radial electron - electron dipolar element . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the one spin - flip decay rate constant is shown as curve 2 .    at this point",
    "it can be understood that the electron - electron dipolar interaction gives the largest contribution to the dipolar decay rates .",
    "decay due to the electron - nucleon interaction occurs for example via the @xmath101-channel .",
    "however , the corresponding decay rates are smaller by a factor of @xmath102 and thus completely negligible .",
    "this also implies that a mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath28 atoms can not achieve equilibrium in the spin degrees of freedom within the lifetime of the gas .",
    "this is completely analogous to the recent experiments with two condensates in different spinstates performed by the jila group @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the lifetime of the gas is of the order of 1 s for a density @xmath103 @xmath21 , and a magnetic bias field of 5 t. although this would provide ample time to perform an experiment , a much shorter lifetime may be adequate . for successful experiments we not only have to require that the time between thermalizing collisions is small compared to the lifetime of the gas , but also that the time scale for formation of the cooper pairs obeys this condition .",
    "the latter is anticipated to be of @xmath104 and therefore in our case much longer than the time between collisions . nevertheless , for a density @xmath105 @xmath21 , we have that @xmath106 nk , and @xmath107 is only about @xmath108 ms .",
    "our calculation overestimates the spin - exchange rate constant below a magnetic field of 1 t , and we estimate that a bias field of @xmath109 t would give a lifetime of at least 1 ms .    in the next subsection we consider the microscopic theory that describes the fermi gas in the normal and the superfluid state .",
    "we only apply the bcs theory here .",
    "the influence of fluctuations @xcite will be addressed in a future publication .      for the homogeneous case , and taking only two - body interactions between atoms in different hyperfine states into account , the gas is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath110 @xmath111 in this expression , @xmath112  and @xmath113  refer again to the two hyperfine states involved .",
    "the field operators @xmath114  and @xmath115  obey the usual fermi anti - commutation relations , and denote the annihilation and creation of a fermion at position @xmath116  in hyperfine state @xmath117  with chemical potential @xmath118 .",
    "the interparticle potential can be approximated by a local potential , @xmath119 , where the constant @xmath120  is a measure of the strength of the interaction .",
    "we come back to the precise value of @xmath120 shortly , but it is in any case negative to account for the effectively attractive nature of the triplet interaction .",
    "the integration over @xmath121 in the hamiltonian is then trivial .",
    "the next step in a mean - field treatment of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , is to develop the operator products @xmath122 and @xmath123 around their mean values by substituting @xmath124 and @xmath125 to first order in the fluctuations , we are left with the following effective mean - field hamiltonian @xmath126 where @xmath127  is the equilibrium value of the density of atoms in state @xmath128 , and equivalently @xmath129 is the equilibrium value of the bcs order parameter @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential of each hyperfine state has now been renormalized to @xmath130   to include , on the mean - field level , all two - body scattering processes with particles in state @xmath131 .",
    "the factor @xmath132  is the two - body scattering matrix , and has been substituted for @xmath120 to incorporate correctly all two body processes into the calculation .",
    "note that the same substitution should not be performed in the expression for @xmath133 , because all two - body interactions are already going to be included by the bcs - treatment as we will see below @xcite . due to the nonequilibrium in the spin degrees of freedom , both chemical potentials @xmath134 and @xmath135  need not be equal , and therefore the densities of atoms in the respective hyperfine level can be varied independently .    substituting for the operator @xmath136  the expression @xmath137 where @xmath138  creates one particle in spin state @xmath117  with momentum @xmath139 , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the density of atoms in state @xmath143  is determined by @xmath144 since the effective mean - field hamiltonian in terms of the operators @xmath145  and @xmath146 is non - diagonal , one can not directly calculate the expectation value @xmath147 .",
    "this is , as usual , resolved by first applying a bogoliubov transformation according to @xcite    @xmath148    @xmath149    [ bogtrans ]    to diagonalize the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ nondiagh ] ) . after performing this unitary transformation ,",
    "we require that the hamiltonian in terms of the new quasiparticle operators @xmath150  and @xmath151  only has diagonal elements , and furthermore that these operators again obey the usual anti - commutation relations for annihilation and creation operators .",
    "this determines the values of the yet unknown , and in principle complex , constants @xmath152  and @xmath153 .",
    "the latter constraint requires that the constants @xmath152  and @xmath153  must satisfy the relations @xmath154 , introducing @xmath155 , i.e.  the free particle energy relative to the average fermi level @xmath156 .",
    "the eigenvalues corresponding to the bogoliubov quasi particles are then given by @xmath157 where @xmath158  for @xmath159 , respectively .",

    "it is clear that the bogoliubov transformation couples particles in state @xmath117  with holes in state @xmath168 , see for example fig .",

    "however , from the lippmann - schwinger equation for the two - body scattering matrix @xcite @xmath182 we find that this divergence is cancelled by a renormalization of @xmath183to @xmath184  @xcite , and the gap equation becomes @xmath185 eliminating from this equation both chemical potentials @xmath178by means of eq .",

    "although this is expected to lower the critical temperature somewhat , the exponential dependence of @xmath186 on the scattering length is most important for our purposes .",

    "we will return to this issue in the next section .      as was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , an important requirement for a bcs transition to occur , is that the system is mechanically stable against density fluctuations .",
    "the negative @xmath4-wave scattering length induces an effectively attractive interatomic potential , so if the density of particles becomes too large , the system can collapse to a fluid or solid state before the systems becomes superfluid in the ( metastable ) gaseous phase . in general , for mechanical stability of the gas at the critical temperature , we must require that the velocities of the two sound modes in the normal state of the gas are real .",
    "these velocities can be calculated from the free energy density @xmath199 of the gas .",
    "since the temperatures of interest are so low that @xmath200 , we can consider the zero - temperature limit , in which the free energy density amounts to the average energy density @xmath201 .",
    "we thus have @xmath202 where @xmath203  is the ideal gas free energy density of the particles in each hyperfine state at @xmath204 , and @xmath205  is the free energy density that arises due to interactions between particles in both spin states .",

    "the line in the @xmath208 plane , where the equality holds , is called the spinodal line , and for the homogeneous @xmath0li gas it is plotted as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "notice , however , that a spin - polarized fermi gas becomes unstable at densities above the spinodal line , irrespective of the sign of the scattering length @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the question arises as to what exactly happens at densities above the spinodal line , and whether there is a difference in the behavior for positive or negative @xmath4-wave scattering length .",
    "first of all , notice that the matrix @xmath209has an eigenvalue @xmath210 at the spinodal point .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector @xmath211 points into the unstable direction of the phase space . for equal densities of the two hyperfine states ,",

    "( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dgdt ] ) . in combination with the results that the density profiles in the normal and superfluid phase are almost equal",
    ", we conclude that the hydrodynamic equations that describe the density fluctuations are almost identical , and therefore , that there will be no significant difference in the collective excitation spectrum in the superfluid and normal phase respectively . consequently , other means of experimental detection must be investigated",
    "of course , this conclusion is based on experiments that couple directly to density fluctuations such as in refs .",
    "@xcite . if one can couple also to second sound one would of course observe an additional mode below @xmath186 .",
    "another possible way to detect the superfluid state is by a measurement of the two - body decay rate of the gas .",
    "note that , in our case , three - body recombination processes are strongly suppressed , since we are dealing with fermions , and only have two different hyperfine states occupied . above the critical temperature ,",
    "the two - body rate constants are essentially independent of @xmath190 , and the magnitude is depicted as a function of the applied magnetic field in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in analogy to the case of a bose gas , where the presence of a condensate decreases the decay rate due to two - body processes by a factor of about 2 @xcite",
    ", we now analyze the change in the decay rate due to the presence of cooper pairs in the fermi gas below the critical temperature .    using the correlator method from ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the decay rate constant due to two - body processes is given by @xmath406 where the correlator @xmath407 equals 1 above @xmath186 , but increases due to the nonzero expectation value @xmath408  below the critical temperature . indeed , using the transformations given by eqs .",
    "( [ secondq ] ) and ( [ bogtrans ] ) , it is found that @xmath409 where @xmath410  is again given by the ultra - violet diverging expression in eq .",
    "( [ gapeq1 ] ) .",
    "the question now arises what we should use for @xmath120 in this expression .",
    "clearly , the denominator @xmath120 should not be considered as the zero - momentum component of the triplet potential .",
    "physically , this can be understood by the fact that this value of @xmath120  does not characterize the exact non - local two - body triplet potential in any way .",
    "it does not even reproduce the correct long distance behavior for the scattered wave function .",
    "therefore , a first guess would be to replace @xmath120 by @xmath411 , but since the @xmath4-wave scattering length in this case is much larger than the effective range @xmath6  of the interaction @xmath412 , it is likely that the replacement of @xmath120 by @xmath411  underestimates the effect of the presence of the superfluid phase on the decay rates considerably .    instead , from our procedure to remove the ultra - violet divergence in the gap equation",
    ", we see that @xmath120 should be chosen such that it satisfies the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath413 where a cut - off @xmath414 is introduced . solving this equation for @xmath120 , and using that the fermi energy @xmath415",
    ", we find that @xmath416    applying this result we can now make an estimate of the effect of the presence of the superfluid phase .",
    "to simplify the calculation , we will calculate the effect at @xmath204  for a homogeneous gas with @xmath417 .",
    "we then have that @xmath418 .",
    "moreover , from the bcs theory we know that the zero - temperature value of the order parameter @xmath306  is related to the critical temperature by @xmath419 .",
    "so @xmath420   \\frac{1.76 k_b t_c}{\\epsilon_f } \\frac{3 \\pi n}{4 k_fa } \\right)^2.\\ ] ] from the functional behavior of the triplet potential @xmath412 , we deduce that the range of the two - body interaction @xmath421 .",
    "therefore , substituting @xmath422 and @xmath423 , we find that in the case of @xmath0li atoms , @xmath424 .",
    "note that , as expected , the fermi wavenumber @xmath425  is much smaller than the cut - off value @xmath426 : for a density @xmath427 @xmath21 , we have @xmath428 , resulting in @xmath429 , which is indeed much smaller than the cut - off @xmath426 . using that @xmath430 nk for @xmath431 @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) it turns out that @xmath432 and the correlator @xmath433 , which is much larger than its value above the critical temperature .",
    "had we used @xmath411 instead of @xmath120 , the change in the correlator would have been only of the order of @xmath434 . even though we do not expect that the corrections to the decay rates are as large as the above crude argument suggests",
    ", we do believe that it might be of the order unity , and may be measurable .",
    "of course , the cut - off dependence of @xmath120  should in some way drop out of the theory eventually , but for this a better theory is needed , which takes into account the precise details of the triplet potential and does not make use of a pseudo - potential to replace it .",
    "work along these lines is in progress , because of the experimental importance to have a reliable estimate of the changes in the relaxation rate constants .",
    "furthermore , note that the correlator @xmath435 from eq.([correlator ] ) also appears in the expression of the average energy of the system @xcite .",
    "a measurement of this quantity has been done for the case of bose gases @xcite , and we believe that also in the case of fermions , a change in the average energy at the critical temperature can signal the presence of the superfluid phase .    in summary , we considered a gas of atomic @xmath0li occupying two hyperfine states trapped in a magnetic field .",
    "atoms in different hyperfine levels can interact via @xmath4-wave scattering .",
    "using the most up - to - date triplet potential , we showed that the lifetime of such a gas with a density of @xmath20 @xmath21 per hyperfine level is of the order of 1 second , when a magnetic bias field of 5 t is applied . at this density",
    "the gas becomes superfluid at a temperature of about 11 nk .",
    "we also investigated the mechanical stability of a two - component fermi gas , and showed that , if the two - particle interaction is repulsive , the gas is unstable for spin - density fluctuations , whereas in case the interatomic interaction is attractive , the gas is unstable against density fluctuations above the spinodal line .",
    "furthermore we considered the superfluid state of atomic @xmath0li , trapped in an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential , in the local density approximation .",
    "we showed that the critical temperature @xmath321 is a universal function of the quantities @xmath355 and @xmath436 .",
    "below the critical temperature there is almost no change in the density profile of the gas cloud .",
    "therefore we suggest that the presence of the superfluid state might be signaled by a change in the decay rates or a change in the average energy at the critical temperature .",
