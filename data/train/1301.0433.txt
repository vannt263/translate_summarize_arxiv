    "the data suggest a slight increase of predissociation at @xmath165 , an effect that was hypothesized by glass - maujean _ et al._@xcite and later by gao _ et al._@xcite as resulting from a contribution by an additional predissociation channel , the @xmath166 double well potential @xcite intersecting the @xmath22 state near 5.5 a.u . as shown in fig .",

    "future mqdt calculations may elucidate whether this phenomenon indeed occurs at @xmath165 .",
    "also such calculations may explain the observed values for @xmath145 in the range @xmath167 .",
    "the superior resolution of the novel xuv fourier - transform instrument is applied for a reinvestigation of the @xmath23 absorption system in h@xmath35 .",

    "the widths and @xmath9-asymmetry parameters can be calculated in various first principles schemes to be compared at a high level of accuracy to experiment .",
    "the presently measured transition frequencies are the most accurate and signify an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over previous studies @xcite . the data are extended up to the highest @xmath7 vibrational level in the @xmath26 state .",
    "the ft spectrometer has a far better resolution than that obtained by scanning monochromators but with the measurement limited to direct absorption only it can not provide all the information of the interaction between light and molecules . in this way the combination of the two experimental techniques , the ft absorption spectrum from soleil and the scanning monochromator measurements from bessyii , are complimentary .",
    "this leads to an almost complete characterization of the molecular state .",
    "the extracted predissociation widths are found to decrease up to @xmath149 as expected from theory , with indication of a possible sudden increase in @xmath41 at @xmath162 , which might be explained by the opening up of an additional predissociation channel associated with the @xmath168 double well state .",
    "the smooth development of a decreasing @xmath6-doubling in the @xmath26 state toward higher vibrational levels is consistent with the decrease in the predissociation rates and in excellent agreement with calculation  @xcite for @xmath143 ; both phenomena have their origin in overlap with the @xmath169 state .",
    "the positions of the @xmath170 levels are measured to an accuracy of 0.06 @xmath4 , which is the most accurate to date .",
    "these data compare extremely well to previously calculated positions within the mqdt - framework  @xcite suggesting an accuracy better than 1 @xmath4  and providing further proof for its suitability for the modelling of such complex molecular processes at very high excitation energy in the molecule .",
