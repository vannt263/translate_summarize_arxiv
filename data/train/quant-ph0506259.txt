  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in quantum information processing by nmr one of the major challenges is relaxation or decoherence . often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state of a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a definite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation . as these preferred initial states are non - equilibrium states , they are not stationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its equilibrium , introducing error in computation . since it is not possible to cut off the relaxation processes completely , attempts are going on to develop alternate strategies like quantum error correction codes or noiseless subsystems . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the relaxation behavior of various pseudo pure states and analyze the role of cross terms between different relaxation processes , known as cross - correlation . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that while cross - correlations accelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states , they retard that of others . </S>"
