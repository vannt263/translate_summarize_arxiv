    "starburst galaxies are objects in which the total energetics are dominated by star formation and associated phenomena ( weedman 1983 ; heckman 1998 ) .",
    "this definition covers galaxies with a very wide range of properties , from blue compact dwarfs to ultraluminous iras starbursts .",
    "typical masses ( bolometric luminosities ) range from 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 ( 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 l@xmath3 ) , corresponding the lowest limit to the mass of super - star - clusters and the highest limit to the mass of the infrared - luminous galaxies ( leitherer 1996 ) .",
    "nearby starburst galaxies are ideal laboratories in which to explore fundamental questions about the local and global processes and effects of star formation .",
    "for example , is the initial mass function the same in starburst galaxies as in quiescent star formation in the milky way ?",
    "is there a connection between starburst activity and active galactic nuclei ?",
    "what can starbursts teach us about the process by which the first galaxies formed ?",
    "starburst are powered by massive stars .",
    "massive stars ( m@xmath8 m@xmath3 ) emit photons with energies of tens of ev which are absorbed and re - emitted in their stellar winds , producing ultraviolet resonance transitions . however , the stellar wind is optically thin to most of the ultraviolet photons , that can travel tens of pc from the star before they are absorbed and photoionize the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "then , this ionized gas cools down via an emission line spectrum .",
    "this is , in essence , the spectral dichotomy picture of a starburst galaxy : a nebular emission line spectrum at optical wavelengths and an absorption - line spectrum at wavelengths shorter than the balmer jump ( leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "however , the presence of a starburst affects the entire spectrum and not only the uv - optical spectrum .",
    "thus , supernova remnants following the explosion of massive stars generate x - ray and radio continuum emission ; red supergiant stars emit strongly in the near - ir continuum ; the mid - ir is dominated by line and continuum emission from warm dust within the star forming regions ; the far - ir is thermal emission from dust heated by absorbing uv and optical light ; electron accelerated by supernova remnants create radio synchroton emission .",
    "a truly complete analysis of a starburst would account for all these features .",
    "evolutionary synthesis is a powerful tool for understanding starburst galaxies .",
    "this technique makes a prediction for the spectrum of a stellar population taking as a free parameter the star formation history of the starburst ( age , initial mass function , star formation rate , etc ) .",
    "if there is agreement between the observations and the predicted physical properties ( spectral energy distribution , colors , line profiles , etc ) , constraints on the star formation history ( in timescale between 1 myr to several gyr ) can be determined ( see e.g. mas - hesse & kunth , 1991 ; bruzual & charlot , 1993 ; leitherer & heckman , 1995 ) .",
    "however , the solution obtained with this technique may not be unique , and only _ consistency _ between models and observations can be derived .    to make a complete analysis of a starburst",
    ", we have to answer the question : are evolutionary synthesis models , and the stellar evolution models they incorporate , actually up to the challenge of interpreting multi - wavelength data ? to answer this , we have undertaken a detailed study of the starburst galaxy ngc 7714 .",
    "ngc 7714 is an sbb peculiar galaxy ( de vaucouleurs et al 1991 ) classified by weedman et al ( 1981 ; here after w81 ) as a prototypical starburst galaxy .",
    "its heliocentric radial velocity , as compiled by nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , is 2798 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this places ngc 7714 at a distance of 37.3 mpc assuming h@xmath10= 75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "heckman et al ( 1998 ) derive a distance of 37.9 mpc using the standard linear virgo centric infall model of schechter ( 1980 ) with parameters @xmath11=2 , @xmath12= 976 km s@xmath9 , @xmath13=220 km s@xmath9 and @xmath14= 15.9 mpc .",
    "the b magnitud and far - infrared luminosity ( as calculated from the 60 @xmath15 m and 100 @xmath15 m iras bands ) are -20.04 and 43.93 erg s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the far - infrared ratio 60/100 and 25/60 are larger than 0.9 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "the mass of the neutral gas is @xmath0",
    "10@xmath2 m@xmath3 ( mirabel & wilson , 1989 ) . the x - ray , iue ultraviolet , optical , and vla radio fluxes are explained as a consequence of intense star formation activity in its nucleus . to explain the x - ray and radio luminosities , 10@xmath16 supernova remnants are required ( w81 ) .",
    "bernlhr ( 1993 ) found from the optical continuum and fir colors that the star formation in ngc 7714 is consistent with a continuous star formation rate during the past 20 myr , and that it had probably been triggered by the interaction with the companion galaxy ngc 7715 ( vorontsov - velyaminov 1977 ; arp 1966 ; smith , struck , & pogge , 1997 ) .",
    "very detailed studies have been carried out in the optical and near - ir part of the spectrum to characterize the gas properties in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions ( gonzlez - delgado et al 1995 , hereafter gd95 , and references therein ) .",
    "gd95 conclude that the burst of star formation in the nucleus of the galaxy should have an age around 4 - 5 myr , in view of the wr bump detection , and pointed out the presence of a previous burst of star formation on the basis of the detection of calcium triplet absorption at 8600  .",
    "models by garca - vargas et al ( 1997 ) indicate that a young burst of age between 3.5 and 5 myr is able to explain the emission line spectrum and the wr luminosity bump in three circumnuclear hii regions of ngc 7714 .    here",
    ", we present hst+ghrs ultraviolet spectroscopy of the nuclear starburst .",
    "these data are analyzed together with the optical emission line spectrum to obtain information about the ionizing stellar population .",
    "the goal is to perform a consistency test between the stellar content derived from multi - wavelength observations in the central few hundred parsecs in ngc 7714 .",
    "we will evaluate whether the youngest burst can account for the high supernova rate ( 1 yr@xmath9 ; w81 ) derived from the x - ray and radio continuum emission .",
    "a following paper will present the results for the nir k - band spectroscopy and the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( goldader et al 1998 ; in preparation ) .",
    "it will focus on the extincted and low mass stellar content of the nuclear starburst in ngc 7714 .",
    "calzetti ( 1997 ) analyzed the properties of the ngc 7714 starburst on a kpc scale .",
    "the new ghrs data allow us to probe the nuclear starburst on a scale that is an order of magnitud smaller .",
    "the new data are useful to study if and how the star formation properties in ngc 7714 differ between pc and kpc scales .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the hst observations .",
    "section 3 deals with the results and interpretation of the hst ultraviolet spectrum . in section 4",
    "we present photoionization models that fit the emission line spectrum in the optical - near infrared spectral range .",
    "the multiwavelength analysis of the ngc 7714 spectrum is in section 5 .",
    "the summary and the conclusions are in section 6 .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum of the central nuclear starburst in ngc 7714 was obtained in october 1996 with the hubble space telescope using the ghrs and the grating g140l , through the large science aperture ( lsa , @xmath17 arcsec@xmath18 corresponding to 330@xmath1330 pc@xmath19 ) .",
    "two different wavelength settings were observed , covering 1175 to 1461   and 1402 to 1689  , with a total integration time of 1659 s and 4542 s , respectively .",
    "after standard pipeline processing , the spectra were combined into a single spectrum covering 1175 to 1689  , and rebinned to 0.57  / pixel , which is the nominal dispersion of the grating .",
    "the spectrum was corrected for redshift assuming a radial velocity of 2800 km s@xmath9 ( gd95 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectrum in the restframe wavelength system of the galaxy .",
    "the spectrum is rich in stellar ( civ @xmath201550 , sv @xmath201501 , ciii @xmath201417 , siiv @xmath201400 , nv @xmath201240 , ciii @xmath201175 ) , and interstellar ( alii @xmath201670 , feii @xmath201608 , civ @xmath201550 , siii @xmath201527 , siiv @xmath201400 , cii @xmath201335 , oi+siii @xmath201302 , siii @xmath201260 ) absorption lines .",
    "it also shows l@xmath21 and heii @xmath201640 in emission .",
    "some of the interstellar lines have weaker satellites formed in the milky way halo ( siii @xmath201527 , siiv @xmath201400 , cii @xmath201335 , oi+siii @xmath201302 , and siii @xmath201260 ) .",
    "the zero point of the wavelength calibration was checked by fitting gaussians to the galactic absorption lines .",
    "these lines are blueshifted about 0.3 - 0.4   with respect to the nominal zero point of 2800 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this is well within the uncertainties expected for an observation through the lsa .",
    "the instrumental spectral resolution for a point source within the lsa is about 0.8  , but for an extended source it depends on the size of the ultraviolet source .",
    "the widths ( fwhm ) of the gaussians fitted to the galactic lines are 3.3   or 740 km s@xmath9 at 1400  .",
    "this suggests that the object fills a substantial fraction of the aperture .",
    "the flux measured at 1500   is @xmath22 erg s@xmath9 @xmath23 @xmath9 .",
    "this is a factor of 2 lower than the iue flux reported by kinney et al ( 1993 ) , indicating that the uv bright stellar population significantly exceeds the area of the ghrs lsa .",
    "an hst wfpc2 pc image through the filter f606w ( @xmath24= 6010.6  , @xmath25= 1497  ) was retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "the band pass of this filter includes strong emission lines such as [ oiii]@xmath205007 and h@xmath21 , so that the light detected through this filter is not only continuum emission .",
    "the integration time was 500 s. the sampling is 0.046 arcsec / pixel , corresponding to 8.7 pc / pixel .",
    "figure 2a shows a view of the whole galaxy .",
    "most of the emission comes from the nucleus with some contribution from the two spiral arms .",
    "this central emission is resolved into a compact knot surrounded by several smaller knots .",
    "the ghrs spectroscopy suggests that the starburst is extended at ultraviolet wavelengths as well .",
    "therefore the spatial morphology in the optical and the ultraviolet is rather similar .",
    "massive hot stars develop strong stellar winds due to radiation pressure in ultraviolet resonance lines ( morton 1967 ; lucy & solomon 1970 ) . typical wind velocities in o stars are about 2000 km s@xmath9 to 3000 km s@xmath9 ( groenewegen , lamers , & pauldrach 1989 ; prinja , barlow , & howarth 1990 ) . as a result , all strong ultraviolet lines in the spectra of o stars originate predominantly in the outflow , and have blueshifted absorptions .",
    "the profile shapes reflect the stellar mass - loss rates , which are a strong function of the stellar luminosity ( castor , abbott , & klein 1975 ) .",
    "since there exists a well - defined stellar mass - luminosity relation , the line profiles ultimately depend on the stellar mass , and  for a stellar population  on the imf and sf history ( leitherer , robert , & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "the strongest stellar wind resonance features are ovi @xmath201034 , nv @xmath201240 , siiv @xmath201400 and civ @xmath201550 . in massive stars ,",
    "these lines form above the photosphere in the stellar wind  either as a blueshifted absorption in stars with weak winds , or as a p cygni profile if the wind density is sufficiently high .",
    "ovi and civ are strong lines in o stars of all luminosity classes ( walborn , bohlin , & panek 1985 ; gonzlez delgado , leitherer , & heckman 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , siiv is luminosity dependent , and only blue supergiant stars produce a strong p cygni profile ( walborn et al 1985 ) .",
    "the recombination line heii @xmath201640 can also be formed in very massive o and wr stars with very dense winds .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models for civ ( leitherer , robert , & heckman 1995 ) show that the line strength increases for a shallower imf .",
    "the most massive stars are the dominant contributors to the lines , and increasing their numbers relative to the less massive stars which produce the continuum  either via flattening the imf slope or increasing the upper cut - off mass  leads to stronger lines .",
    "siiv shows a critical dependence on the age of the burst .",
    "this spectroscopic method is only efficient in regions of recent star formation activity and high stellar density where the highest masses can be sampled .",
    "the technique has been succesfully applied to starburst galaxies ( conti , leitherer , & vacca 1996 ; leitherer et al 1996 ; gonzlez delgado et al 1998a ) and seyfert galaxies ( heckman et al 1997 ; gonzlez delgado et al 1998b ) . in all these cases ,",
    "the method has constrained the age and the mass spectrum of the young population .",
    "ngc 7714 has been observed previously by iue ( w81 ; kinney et al 1993 ) .",
    "the spectra show strong civ and siiv in absorption , indicating the presence of massive stars in ngc 7714 .",
    "however , the interstellar lines are also very strong in ngc 7714 and contribute significantly to the strength of the civ and siiv lines .",
    "the interstellar contribution can some times dominate the profile of the line , as is the case of ngc 1705 ( heckman & leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "this is why an analysis based only in the equivalent width of these lines can not predict correctly the stellar content and the star formation history of the starburst . to fully resolve the stellar from the interstellar contribution ,",
    "a resolution better than the iue resolution of r=1000 is required .",
    "the most conspicuous stellar lines in the ghrs spectra of ngc 7714 are the wind lines heii , civ , siiv and nv . we use line profile synthesis of the ultraviolet wind lines to derive the stellar content and to constrain the star formation history of the nuclear starburst .",
    "we do not fit the entire line profile of the civ and siiv due to the contribution of the interstellar lines , which are not fully accounted for in the models , and are stronger in the starburst spectra than in the synthetic models .",
    "we select two windows , corresponding to the blue side of the wind profile ( 1381.75 - 1390.75    for siiv and 1528.0 - 1543.75   for civ ) and to the red side ( 1403.5 - 1409.5   for siiv and 1552.0 - 1560.25   for civ ) , where the profile is dominated by the stellar contribution .",
    "then , we compute the @xmath26 parameter between the observations and models . the results for siiv are plotted for burst and continuous star formation ( csf ) models as a function of the age , upper mass cut - off , and slope of the imf in figures 3a , b and 3c , d , respectively .",
    "the minimum @xmath26 values for siiv are obtained for instantaneous burst models and a salpeter imf .",
    "the fit for siiv requires the presence of o supergiant stars , which appear between 3 and 6 myr after the burst onset .",
    "the best fit is obtained for a 5 myr burst .",
    "the most massive stars present in the starburst have at least a mass of 40 m@xmath3 .",
    "however , we can not constrain the upper mass cut - off because stars more massive than 40 m@xmath3 have already reached the supernova phase at 5 myr . thus , the upper mass cut - off is higher than 40 m@xmath3 .",
    "figure 4 shows the profiles of the observed civ and siiv and the 5 myr burst model ( salpeter imf and m@xmath27=100 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the civ profile is equally well fitted by csf models , but it is not possible to constrain the age with these models .",
    "note that the emission of the nv p cygni profile is weaker than predicted by the 5 myr burst model .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the siii @xmath201260 absorption line formed in the milky way halo that falls on the blue edge of the emission part of the profile .",
    "the determination of the age is also consistent with the presence of wr stars in the starburst .",
    "wr features have been detected at optical wavelengths ( van breugel et al 1985 ; gd95 ) , and also in our ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "the heii @xmath201640 is a recombination line which shows a broad emission profile if it is formed in the very dense stellar winds of wr stars and o3-o5 supergiants ( walborn , bohlin , & panek 1985 ) .",
    "this line is prominent in the ghrs spectrum , and the observed flux is @xmath28 erg s@xmath9 @xmath23 .",
    "later we will use this flux to estimate the number of wr stars present in the nuclear starburst .",
    "the spectrum shows several photospheric lines , such as sv @xmath201501 , ciii @xmath201427 , and siiii @xmath201417 .",
    "these lines are prominent in o and early b stars ( walborn et al 1985 ; walborn , parker , & nichols 1995 ) ; they are not resonance lines , and therefore they do not form in the interstellar medium .",
    "their measured equivalent widths are in table 1 .",
    "note that the strength of these lines is also consistent with the synthetic model ( see figure 5 ) .      to derive the number of wr and o stars in the starburst",
    ", we need to estimate the extinction .",
    "this can be done using the ultraviolet continuum flux distribution .",
    "leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) have derived from evolutionary synthesis models that the uv energy distribution arising from a starburst has a spectral index , @xmath21 , in the range -2.6 to -2.2 ( f@xmath29 @xmath30 ) , if the burst is less than 10 myr old .",
    "this spectral index is rather independent of the metallicity and imf .",
    "therefore , any deviation from the predicted spectral index can be attributed to reddening .",
    "first , the spectrum is corrected for the galactic extinction , which we derive assuming a ratio of n@xmath31/e(b - v)= @xmath32 cm@xmath19 ( bohlin 1975 ) and an hi column density towards ngc 7714 of @xmath34 @xmath23 ( stark et al 1992 ) .",
    "the color excess derived is @xmath35 ; this implies an extinction of 0.65 mag at 1500  .",
    "the slope measured in the corrected spectrum ( log f@xmath36 vs. log @xmath20 ) after applying the correction for foreground extinction is @xmath37=-2.45 , very close to the theoretical value of -2.5 which corresponds to the age deduced from the fit to the absorption profiles .",
    "this indicates very low additional internal extinction associated with the starburst . using the empirical extinction law from calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann ( 1994 ) to match the slope @xmath37=-2.45 to the expected slope @xmath37=-2.5 at 5 myr",
    ", we derive an internal extinction in the starburst of @xmath38 ( 0.26 mag at 1500  ) .",
    "the spectrum corrected for total extinction matches the slope of the synthetic spectrum that fits the wind absorption lines ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "we note that the total extinction derived from the ultraviolet continuum is lower than the total extinction derived from the balmer decrement , e(b - v)=0.21 ( gd95 ) .",
    "this discrepancy between the extinction values derived from the two methods has previously been found by fanelli , oconnell , & thuan ( 1988 ) and calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann ( 1994 ) .",
    "this result suggests that probably ionized gas and stars are not co - spatial in a starburst ( calzetti 1996 ) .",
    "the extinction derived above pertains only to the ultraviolet light within the ghrs aperture ; however , the iue spatial profile indicates that the ultraviolet light is extended , at least along p.a.=135@xmath39.45 .",
    "figure 6 shows the iue ultraviolet light profile that was obtained by adding all the data in the dispersion direction in the wavelength range from 1250 to 1850  .",
    "the iue aperture was oriented at p.a= 135@xmath39.45 .",
    "the profile shows a wing on one side that extends between 4 and 10 arcsec from the camera pixel with the highest emission . this wing could represent the ultraviolet emission from the circumnuclear region called a by gd95 .",
    "we have followed the same procedure to determine the extinction for the iue spectrum . after correcting for galactic extinction ,",
    "the spectral index of the corrected iue spectrum is @xmath37=-1.1 .",
    "this result is in agreement with that found by heckman et al ( 1998 ) , @xmath37=-1.03 .",
    "the change of the slope with respect to the ghrs spectrum indicates a change of the extinction and/or of the stellar population with the aperture .",
    "the change of the extinction with the aperture could be due to the swept dust by the stellar winds and sn explosion . using the empirical extinction law from calzetti",
    "et al ( 1994 ) , we derive an internal extinction @xmath40 ( 2.8 mag at 1500  ) .",
    "this represents an upper limit to the reddening , because an extended population of b and a stars could contribute significantly to the ultraviolet continuum light in the iue aperture , flattening the spectral slope , in which case the intrinsic reddening of the starburst would be lower .",
    "thus , the iue spectrum reveals the presence of extended star formation which could be more dusty than the nuclear burst and/or more evolved .",
    "alternatively , the iue aperture could pick up a large flux contribution from an older field population , that makes the slope of the spectrum flatter than expected by a hot stellar population .",
    "note that the color excess derived depends on the extinction law used .",
    "if we use the lmc or the smc law , the e(b - v ) derived is 0.2 and 0.1 , respectively , instead of 0.3 .      after correcting for the total extinction , e(b - v)= 0.11",
    ", the monochromatic luminosity at 1500   in the ghrs aperture is @xmath41 erg s@xmath9 @xmath9 . assuming that the ultraviolet flux is due to a burst of 5 myr , and a salpeter imf with upper limit mass cut - off of 100 m@xmath3 , the corresponding number of o stars is about 16600 .",
    "note that an upper cut - off mass of 40 m@xmath3 gives the same result .",
    "these stars produce a photon ionizing luminosity of @xmath42 s@xmath9 .",
    "we have measured the nuclear h@xmath37 flux from the 2d data in gd95 within two different apertures of sizes that bracket the ghrs aperture size , @xmath43 arcsec@xmath18 and @xmath44 arcsec@xmath18 . after correcting for the extinction derived from the balmer decrement ,",
    "the ionizing photon luminosity deduced from the h@xmath37 flux within these two apertures is @xmath45 s@xmath9 and @xmath46 s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the ionizing photon luminosity deduced from the uv continuum .",
    "however , some h@xmath37 flux could be lost due to seeing and the width of the slit .",
    "therefore a conservative upper limit to the ionizing photon luminosity is 1.4 - 1.6 times the values derived above .",
    "the estimated mass of the starburst is at least @xmath47 m@xmath3 ( integrating the imf down to a lower mass limit of 1 m@xmath3 ) , and the bolometric luminosity is @xmath48 l@xmath3 , similar to the nuclear starbursts observed in seyfert 2 galaxies ( gonzlez delgado et al 1998b ) . the ionizing photon luminosity predicted by continuous star formation models is 10@xmath49 ph s@xmath9 , a factor 4 larger than the value deduced from the h@xmath37 flux .",
    "we can estimate the number of wr stars from the luminosity of the heii @xmath201640 line measured within the ghrs aperture .",
    "after dereddening , and assuming the calibration given by conti ( 1996 ; 1 wn corresponds to @xmath50 erg s@xmath9 ) , the line flux gives a luminosity of @xmath51 erg s@xmath9 , corresponding to about 2000 wr stars .",

    "the equivalent width of the heii @xmath201640 is 2.7  .",
    "these two numbers are compatible with the values predicted by an instantaneous burst ( see figures 2 and 10 in schaerer & vacca 1998 ) .",
    "our conclusion is that a burst 5 myr old with a mass of 5@xmath110@xmath4 m@xmath3 is able to explain the continuum and stellar uv absorption features in the central 1.74@xmath11.74 arcsec of ngc 7714 , with a salpeter imf and upper mass limit higher than 40 m@xmath3 .",
    "the monochromatic luminosity at 1500   in the iue aperture is @xmath52 erg s@xmath9 @xmath9 , after correcting for a total reddening e(b - v)=0.38 .",
    "this implies a bolometric luminosity of @xmath53 l@xmath3 , an ionizing photon luminosity of 2@xmath110@xmath54 ph s@xmath9 and a mass of @xmath55 m@xmath3 ( assuming an age of 5 myr ) , a factor 20 larger than the values derived from the ghrs aperture .",
    "the iue bolometric luminosity is similar to the total ir luminosity , @xmath56 l@xmath3 , measured by iras and computed with the four wavelength bands as defined by sanders & mirabel ( 1997 ) .",
    "thus , this extended star - formation region could contribute significantly to the overall galaxy bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , these results have been derived under the assumption that the change in the slope in the iue spectrum is due to internal extinction .",
    "if an underlying older population contributes significantly to the iue aperture by flattening the spectrum , the derived color excess , and the mass , bolometric luminosity and the ionizing photon luminosity , represent an upper limit to the true values .",
    "the other extreme case is to assume that no internal extinction affects the iue flux . in this case , the monochromatic luminosity at 1500   is 10@xmath57 erg s@xmath9 @xmath9 .",
    "this implies an ionizing photon luminosity of 1.2@xmath110@xmath58 ph s@xmath9 , which is a factor 2.5 lower than the rate of ionizing photons derived from the h@xmath21 image adding the contribution of the nucleus and the region a ( note that these two components fall within the iue aperture , see figure 1 in gd95 ) .",
    "thus , the change of slope is probably due to both , a change of reddening and the contribution of an underlying population .",
    "evidence that an underlying population contributes to the iue aperture comes from the civ profile .",
    "this line is significantly more diluted in the iue than in the ghrs spectrum ( figure 7 ) .",
    "thus , the iue spectrum suggests that an underlying population contributes to its flux , and this makes the determination of the starburst properties from the iue flux rather uncertain .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum shows two systems of interstellar lines , one formed in the milky way halo and the other in ngc 7714 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the most prominent lines in ngc 7714 are alii @xmath201670 , feii @xmath201608 , siii @xmath201527 , cii @xmath201335 , oi+siii @xmath201302 , siii @xmath201260 and siii @xmath201190 .",

    "the l@xmath21 flux is @xmath60 erg s@xmath9 @xmath23 and the l@xmath21/h@xmath37 ratio 2.9 ( 4.1 using the h@xmath37 flux measured in the central 1.2@xmath12 arcsec@xmath18 ) . correcting by the reddening derived from the balmer decrement and using the lmc extinction law , the ratio is 23 ( 33 ) ; close to the value predicted from the recombination theory ( 33 , ferland & osterbrock 1985 ) .",
    "we can conclude that attenuation by dust due to multiple resonant scattering by hydrogen atoms does not play an important role in ngc 7714 because the l@xmath21/h@xmath37 ratio corrected for extinction is close to the recombination value .",

    ", we predict the emission line spectrum using a photoionization code that takes as input the spectral energy distribution generated by a stellar evolutionary synthesis code .",
    "this technique is applied as a second independent method to constrain the star formation history and the age of the nuclear starburst in ngc 7714 .",
    "it has been previously used to study the stellar content in starbursts and giant hii regions ( garca - vargas & daz 1994 ; garca - vargas , bressan , & daz 1995a , 1995b ; stasiska & leitherer 1996 ; garca - vargas et al 1997 ) .",
    "the goal is to perform a test of consistency between the young stellar content derived from the ultraviolet absorption spectrum and from the optical emission lines .",
    "first , we describe the basis of the stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models .",
    "the spectral energy distribution was generated by the evolutionary synthesis code developed by leitherer and collaborators ( leitherer , robert , & drissen 1992 ) .",
    "the code has been updated recently .",
    "a description of the new version will be presented elsewhere ( leitherer et al 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "two important changes have been made with respect to the previous version of the code .",
    "the most recent stellar evolutionary models of the geneva group ( schaller et al 1992 ; maeder 1994 ) , and the stellar atmospheres grid compiled by lejeune et al ( 1996 ) are used , instead of maeder s ( 1990 ) and kurucz s models ( 1992 ) . as in the previous version of the code",
    ", we use the expanding spherical extended non - lte models published by schmutz et al ( 1992 ) for stars with very strong winds .    the spectral energy distribution was generated using the 0.4 z@xmath3 metallicity tracks ( note that the chemical abundance derived from the emission lines in ngc 7714 is close to half solar , gd95 ) , and assuming two different star formation scenarios ( instantaneous burst and continuous star formation ) . in both cases , a salpeter imf with an upper and lower mass limit cut - off of 80 m@xmath3 and 1 m@xmath3 , respectively , was assumed .",
    "we take the spectral energy distribution as input to the photoionization code cloudy ( version 90.04 , ferland 1997 ) .",
    "cloudy resolves the ionization - recombination and heating - cooling balances , and predicts the ionization structure of the nebula , the temperature , and the intensities of the emission lines .",
    "we assume that the nebular gas is ionization bounded and spherically distributed around the ionizing cluster with a constant density .",
    "we assume an inner radius of 3 pc , but the outer radius is determined by the ionization front .",
    "the chemical composition of the gas is scaled to the oxygen abundance ( close to half solar ) , except for he , s , ne and n. the abundances and the electron density were determined from the optical emission lines as given by gd95 .",
    "they are shown in table 2 .",
    "the adopted values of the solar abundance are as in stasiska ( 1990 ) , except the sulfur abundance , for which we take the s / o ratio given by grevesse & anders ( 1989 ) .",
    "the ionizing photon luminosity is fixed to log(q)=52.9 ph s@xmath9 , as derived above independently from the balmer recombination lines and from the ultraviolet continuum luminosity .",
    "models are computed taking the filling factor as a free parameter , with values of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the change in the filling factor is equivalent to changing the ionization parameter u , defined as q/(4@xmath66r@xmath67n@xmath68c ) ; where q is the ionizing photon luminosity , n@xmath68 the electron density , c the speed of light and r@xmath67 the strmgren radius .",
    "the average u is proportional to ( @xmath69 n@xmath68 q)@xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the filling factor .",
    "the emission line spectrum depends on the ionizing radiation field  i.e. on the evolution of the cluster  and on the ionization parameter for a fixed geometry , metallicity , density and the total number of ionizing photons .",
    "first , we determine the ionization parameter using the ratio [ sii]@xmath206716 + 6731/h@xmath37 .",
    "this ratio is a good calibrator of u for continuous star formation and for burst models ( figure 8) .",
    "the observed ratio [ sii]@xmath206716 + 6731/h@xmath37=0.58 indicates an ionization parameter of -2.9 , corresponding to a filling factor of 0.001 .",
    "then , we use the other emission lines to constrain the star formation scenario ( burst or continuous star formation ) and the age of the starburst .",
    "figure 9 shows the line ratios [ oiii]@xmath205007/h@xmath37 , [ siii]@xmath209069/h@xmath37 , [ oii]@xmath203727/h@xmath37 , [ nii]@xmath206584/h@xmath37 , [ oi]@xmath206300/h@xmath37 and hei@xmath204471/h@xmath37 as a function of age for continous star formation and burst models with filling factor 0.001 .",
    "burst models predict line ratios that are in better agreement with the observed ratios than continuous star formation models .",
    "table 3 shows the strength of the emission lines observed and the values predicted by the 4.5 myr burst .",
    "the 4.5 myr burst model fits well the strongest emission lines , but it does not reproduce the [ oiii]@xmath204363 and [ oi]@xmath206300 lines ; the values observed are a factor of two larger than predicted .",
    "gd95 did three different estimations of the electron temperature of the nebula using the ratio of the auroral to the nebular collisionally excited lines [ siii ] , [ sii ] and [ nii ] lines .",
    "the three ratios give a similar electron temperature ( about 7500 k ) , and with this electron temperature the metallicity was derived .",
    "however , the observed [ oiii]@xmath204363/ [ oiii]@xmath205007 ratio is larger than the expected ratio for a nebula with a electron temperature of 7500 k. this is probably a consequence of a larger contribution of the [ oiii]@xmath204363 line to the temperature ratio . in a nebula",
    "the presence of shocks can significantly affect the lines [ oiii]@xmath204363 and [ oi]@xmath206300 ( peimbert , sarmiento , & fierro 1991 ) .",
    "shocks are naturally expected to be present in the ionized gas surrounding a starburst with age of 5 myr as a result of the stellar wind and the explosion of the first supernovae in the stellar cluster . at this age ,",
    "the deposition rate of mechanical energy is about 10@xmath72 of the ionizing luminosity .",
    "thus , shock heating could probably account for the excess emission in [ oiii]@xmath204363 and [ oi]@xmath206300 with respect to the photoionization values .",
    "this photoionization model predicts a strmgren radius of 185 pc . if the nebula is radiation bounded , the radius is a function of the ionizing photon flux , the electron density and the filling factor .",
    "then for fixed q , ne and @xmath73 , the radius has to be equal to the size of the nebula . we know that the ionizing cluster is not a point source because the ultraviolet interstellar absorption lines in the ghrs spectrum are not resolved .",
    "it is at least as extended as the size of the ghrs aperture ( 330@xmath1330 pc ) .",
    "this size is similar to the strmgren radius predicted .",
    "also , from the wfpc2 image ( see figure 2 ) , we estimate that the size of the nebula is about 210 pc .",
    "thus , the predicted size of the strmgren radius is compatible with the estimated size of the hii nebula .",
    "this result is also consistent with the hii region being radiation bounded .",
    "further evidence comes from the [ oi]@xmath206300 line .",
    "this low ionization line forms in the partially ionized zone , which does not exist in a matter bounded nebula . on the other hand ,",
    "the ionizing photon flux derived from the ultraviolet continuum luminosity is very similar to that derived from the h@xmath37 luminosity , indicating again that the radiation bounded hypothesis is correct .",
    "thus , the conclusion is that emission line ratios can discriminate very well between the burst and continuous star formation ( csf ) scenario .",
    "the csf models can be excluded because they predict emission line ratios which are higher than the values observed ( except for the [ nii ] @xmath206584/h@xmath37 ) .",
    "the best fit is found for a burst 4.5 myr old .",
    "is it reasonable that all these stars are formed in an instantaneous burst ?",
    "the ultraviolet data indicate that the starburst is extended at least 1.74 arcsec ( 330 pc ) .",
    "the hst optical image shows that it may not be more extended than 400 pc ( in diameter ) . taking 400 pc as the diameter of the nuclear starburst and the velocity dispersion for this galaxy of 180 km s@xmath9 ( gd95 ) , we derive that the crossing time within the starburst is 2.1 myr .",
    "this time is significantly shorter than the evolutionary lifetime of a single generation of massive stars .",
    "thus , it is dynamically possible that the nuclear starburst in ngc 7714 formed in an instantaneous burst of star - formation because the crossing - time is shorter than the duration of the starburst .",
    "can the derived stellar population explain the observed x - ray luminosity and radio continuum emission ?",
    "x - ray emission in normal galaxies can have several origins . as discussed by martin & kennicutt ( 1995 ) and stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) , production of x - rays in starburst galaxies by agns , static galactic coronae , single stars , or x -",
    "ray binaries is rather unlikely to be the dominant mechanism .",
    "the most plausible interpretation is due to powering by supernovae , with some contribution from stellar winds .",
    "the models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) predict a type ii supernova rate of about 0.007  yr@xmath9 for a bolometric luminosity of @xmath74 l@xmath3 . if we assume that the kinetic energy released per supernova is @xmath75  erg , the mechanical luminosity released by stellar winds and supernovae is @xmath76  erg s@xmath9 .",
    "if thermalization occurs , this luminosity is _ in principle _ available to create a hot , over - pressured bubble . in practice",
    ", the sum of the thermal and kinetic energy of the bubble will be lower due to radiation losses .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations by thornton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest radiation losses on the order of 90% .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity in the center of ngc  7714 is @xmath77  erg  s@xmath9 ( w81 ) .",
    "if interpreted as due to thermal emission from hot , shocked material , it could be accounted for by supernovae and winds , even allowing for significant radiation losses .",
    "the observed 20  cm radio flux is 20  mjy ( w81 ) . in the standard supernova",
    "driven outflow model ( e.g. , chevalier 1982 ; 1991 ) radio emission is assumed to be synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by shocks in the interaction zone .",
    "models for the non - thermal component of a hot bubble are substantially more uncertain than the thermal ( x - ray ) prediction .",
    "empirical data for individual local supernova remnants indicate non - thermal luminosities of about 1% the thermal value ( chevalier 1982 ) . assuming the 20  cm flux is purely non - thermal , and adopting a bandwidth of @xmath78  ghz , the non - thermal component in ngc  7714 has a luminosity of @xmath79  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "remarkably , this is about 1% of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "therefore we conclude that both the thermal and the non - thermal component of the hot , central ism in ngc  7714 are consistent with being powered by winds and supernovae .",
    "while simple energy considerations are instructive , more detailed hydrodynamical calculations for the behavior of a hot superbubble power by a stellar population are needed .",
    "although still deficient in some aspects ( e.g. with respect to the time dependence of the energy input ) , the relations discussed by martin & kennicutt ( 1995 ) and stevens & strickland ( 1998 ) provide further insight .",
    "these authors used the standard superbubble model to solve the energy and momentum equations for an adiabatic bubble . according to these models",
    ", the x - ray luminosity can be expressed in terms of the starburst luminosity and age for a given imf .",
    "a 5  myr old starburst with a standard salpeter imf is predicted to have a ratio of the x - ray over bolometric luminosity of @xmath0 10@xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "16 of stevens & strickland ) .",
    "applied to ngc  7714 , these models predict an x - ray luminosity of @xmath81  erg  s@xmath9 , within a factor of 3 of the observed value .",
    "the fact that the prediction is lower than the observation might suggest a clumpy ism .",
    "an ambient medium containing clouds or filaments can generate extra mass , and therefore extra x - ray luminosity for fixed mechanical luminosity input ( martin & kennicutt ) .",
    "however , the theoretical and observational uncertainties are large enough that the data are consistent with a homogeneous medium as well .",
    "the stellar population , as derived independently from nebular emission lines and stellar absorption lines , is capable of generating the mechanical energy input to account for the observed thermal x - ray and non - thermal radio emission as well .",
    "the associated supernova rate is 0.007  yr@xmath9 .",
    "this rate is consistent with the upper limit imposed by the null result in the supernova search of richmond , filippenko , & galisky ( 1998 ) .",
    "no supernovae were detected in ngc  7714 during a several year long monitoring period .",
    "the non - detection implies an upper limit to the supernova rate of @xmath82  yr@xmath9 .",
    "few if any supernovae should escape detection due to dust extinction since the extinction is known to be low .",
    "we can account for most of the luminosity at 1500   , which traces precisely the progenitors of type ii supernovae ( @xmath83 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the derived supernova rate is two orders of magnitude lower than that found by w81 .",
    "their estimate was based on using x - ray and radio luminosities and lifetimes of local supernova remnants as templates and scaling them to the luminosities observed in ngc  7714 . in retrospect",
    "this approach has turned out to be too simple .",
    "supernovae and supernova remnants in dense media , like in starbursts , can have rather different properties .",
    "this may be particularly relevant to the very young starburst in ngc  7714 .",
    "few red supergiants have formed at an age of 5  myr , and most of the supernova progenitors are predicted to be wr stars .",
    "wr stars have hydrogen - free envelopes and have stellar - wind properties quite different from red supergiants .",
    "on the other hand , w81 use the truncated starburst models of rieke et al ( 1980 ) to estimate the mass and rate of supernovae . in these models",
    "the imf is truncated with the high mass @xmath84 30 m@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , they have to boost the star formation rate in oder to get the ionizing photons , and therefore the supernova rate became high",
    ". however , our data are compatible with a normal imf .    in the last few years , young compact supernovae",
    "have been studied in detail at radio wavelengths ( weiler et al , 1986 , 1990 , 1991 , 1992 ; van dyk et al 1992 , 1993a , b ; ryder et al 1993 ; yin 1994 ) .",
    "these supernova , at the peak of their emission , can have a radio luminosity which is 100  ",
    "1000 times larger than cas  a. the presence of these supernovae and their remnants can explain the radio luminosity detected in highly luminous iras galaxies ( colina & prez - olea , 1992 ; prez - olea & colina , 1995 ) . evidence that these compact supernova can account for the radio emission comes from 18  cm vlbi continuum imaging observations of arp  220 .",
    "the images have revealed a dozen compact radio sources , with fluxes that can be explained by compact young radio supernova ( smith et al 1998 ) .    assuming that the 6 cm radio emission observed by w81 is non - thermal emission emitted by the central 1.74@xmath11.74 arcsec , and using the models of colina & prez - olea ( 1995 )",
    ", we derive a supernova rate of 0.07 yr@xmath9 , which is in agreement with our empirical upper limit determination , but still one order of magnitude higher than the rate predicted by the model which accounts for the uv luminosity . to predict a supernova rate as high as 0.07 yr@xmath9",
    ", we need a central starburst with a uv luminosity higher than 10@xmath85 erg s@xmath9 @xmath9 .",
    "is the estimated luminosity wrong because of a wrong estimation of the intrinsic reddening derived from the uv continuum slope ?",
    "if the internal reddening were @xmath86 , then the uv luminosity of the starburst in the ghrs aperture would be 10@xmath87 erg s@xmath9 @xmath9 , the supernova rate 0.05 yr@xmath9 , the thermal emission 4 mjy , and the non - thermal emission 6 mjy .",
    "however , by correcting the ghrs spectrum by @xmath86 , the uv spectrum appears clearly over - corrected when compared with the synthetic model . from exploring the fit of the uv continuum slope",
    ", we estimate that the intrinsic reddening can not be higher than 0.1 . correcting for this extinction ,",
    "the luminosity at 1500   is 10@xmath88 erg s@xmath9 @xmath9 , the mass of the starburst 1.1@xmath110@xmath89 m@xmath3 and the supernova rate 0.02 yr@xmath9 . in this case",
    ", we can account for just one third of the radio emission .",
    "compact supernova remnants are also very strong x - ray sources with luminosities in the range 10@xmath90 - 10@xmath91 erg s@xmath9 ( e.g. sn 1978k , ryder et al 1992 ; sn 1986j , bregman & pildis 1992 ; sn 1993j , schlegel 1994 ) .",
    "sn 1988z was detected from rosat hri observations with a luminosity of 10@xmath92 erg s@xmath9 ( fabian & terlevich 1996 ) .",
    "thus , these compact supernova remnants are brighter by several orders of magnitude than the galactic remnants ( 10@xmath93 - 10@xmath94 erg s@xmath9 range ) , and they can contribute significantly to the x - ray flux .",
    "probably even more important , a starburst nucleus is not just a scaled - up version of an individual supernova remnant .",
    "the superposition of numerous supernova explosions and the effects of stellar winds create a hot , over - pressured bubble which expands and can experience a break - out from the galaxy ( heckman 1995 ) .",
    "the relation between the x - ray luminosity of the bubble and the properties of the stellar population , including the supernova rate , can be quite different from what is expected on the basis of individual supernova remnants ( although the physics is related ) .",
    "the success of the simple superbubble model discussed above is encouraging .",
    "we conclude that the previously derived supernova rate of @xmath01  yr@xmath9 is not supported by more recent starburst models and that the current supernova rate in the nucleus of ngc  7714 is close to about 1 per century .    incidentally , this rate is about the same as the disk - integrated rate observed in normal spirals , including the milky way .",
    "ngc  7714 does not have a significantly higher total supernova rate than observed in spirals with active star formation .",
    "what distinguishes ngc  7714 ( and other nuclear starbursts ) , is the concentration of the supernova events in the nucleus .",
    "the _ nuclear _ supernova rate per unit surface is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of normal galaxies .",
    "is there evidence for an additional stellar component younger than 30 - 40 myr in the nucleus of ngc 7714 ?",
    "bursts younger than 30 - 40 myr will contribute to the non - thermal emission ( stars more massive than 8 m@xmath3 explode as supernovae , and their life - time is less than 30 - 40 myr ) .",
    "when older than 10 myr , they will not contribute to the strength of the emission lines , but will affect the equivalent widths of the recombination emission lines . for a burst 4.5 myr old ,",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath37 is 65  , however , the observed value is 30  .",
    "thus , the equivalent width of h@xmath37 must be diluted .",
    "but we do not know whether it is diluted by a burst younger than 30 - 40 myr , or by the bulge population . in the near - infrared",
    ", the spectrum shows the caii triplet in absorption .",
    "the strength of these lines is dependent on both metallicity and gravity ( daz , terlevich , & terlevich 1989 ) . at solar metallicity , these lines are very strong in starbursts if the near - infrared light is dominated by red supergiant stars",
    ". population synthesis models of the two strongest absorption lines ( caii @xmath208542 and caii @xmath208562 ) for half solar metallicity predict an equivalent width for the two lines of 4 - 5   for burst younger than 40 myr ( garca - vargas et al 1998 ) .",
    "the observed value is 4.5   ( gd95 ) , in agreement with the prediction of the models .",
    "however , the same models predict an equivalent width somewhat larger than 5   for a a burst older than 100 myr . thus , even though the strength of the caii triplet is compatible with a burst younger than 40 myr , we can not exclude that the lines could be dominated by red giant instead of red supergiant stars .",
    "thus , the equivalent width of h@xmath37 and the strenght of the caii triplet show evidence that an underlying population contributes to the central 1.7@xmath11.7 arcsec spectrum of ngc 7714 .",

    "<S> we have studied the physical conditions in the central 300 pc of the proto - typical starburst galaxy ngc 7714 . our analysis is based on ultraviolet spectroscopy with the hst+ghrs and ground - based optical observations , and it covers also x - ray and radio data taken from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the data are interpreted using evolutionary models optimized for young starburst regions . </S>",
    "<S> the massive stellar population is derived in a self - consistent way using the continuum and _ stellar _ absorption lines in the ultraviolet and the _ nebular _ emission line optical spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the central starburst has an age of about 4.5 myr , with little evidence for an age spread . </S>",
    "<S> wolf - rayet features at the ultraviolet indicates a stellar population of @xmath0 2000 wolf - rayet stars . </S>",
    "<S> the overall properties of the newly formed stars are quite similar to those derived , e.g. , in 30  doradus . </S>",
    "<S> a standard salpeter imf is consistent with all observational constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus of ngc  7714 has a bolometric luminosity of 0.5 - 1@xmath110@xmath2 l@xmath3 and a mass of 5 - 10@xmath110@xmath4 m@xmath3 ( if low - mass stars have formed ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for spatial structure within the central 300  pc sampled . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is unlikely that the nucleus of ngc  7714 hosts a single star cluster exceeding the properties of other known clusters . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous suggestions , we find no evidence for a nuclear supernova rate that would significantly exceed the total disk - integrated rate . </S>",
    "<S> about one supernova event per century is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> most of them are associated with the core - collapse of a hydrogen - free or -poor progenitor . an older stellar generation , with ages of tens of myr and older , </S>",
    "<S> is suggested as well . </S>",
    "<S> this population is less concentrated towards the nucleus and extends over kpc scales    @xmath5 based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by aura , inc . </S>",
