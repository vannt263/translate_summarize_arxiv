    "our paper is a part of a broader program that aims to connect research on derivatives on fractals ( @xcite and references therein ) and on more general regular dirichlet spaces @xcite with classical and geometric analysis on metric measure spaces ( @xcite and references therein ) . in our previous article",
    "@xcite we showed that on certain topologically one - dimensional spaces with a strongly local regular dirichlet form one can prove a natural version of the hodge theorem for @xmath0-forms defined in @xmath2-sense : the set of harmonic @xmath0-forms is dense in the orthogonal complement of the exact @xmath0-forms . in this context",
    "harmonic @xmath0-forms appear as limits of @xmath0-forms that are locally harmonic , i.e. locally representable as differentials of harmonic functions , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 ) .",
    "this result is complicated because in many interesting fractal examples the space of harmonic forms is infinite dimensional in a very strong sense , more precisely , its restriction to any non - empty open subset is infinite dimensional . in this paper",
    "we discuss a question that deals with the exterior derivative operator defined on @xmath0-forms .",
    "it may happen that although the space is topologically one - dimensional , there are nontrivial @xmath1-forms in the @xmath2-sense .",
    "examples can be found amongst the non - self - similar sierpinski carpets of positive two - dimensional lebesgue measure introduced in @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : sc ] ) .     from the paper of mackay , tyson and wildrick , @xcite ( see page 3 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3548v2[arxiv:1201.3548 ] for the precise definition),title=\"fig : \" ]   from the paper of mackay , tyson and wildrick , @xcite ( see page 3 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.3548v2[arxiv:1201.3548 ] for the precise definition),title=\"fig : \" ]    on such a carpet @xmath3 we can consider the classical notions of energy and exterior derivation by restricting smooth functions and forms from @xmath4 to @xmath3 . in particular , applying the ( classical ) exterior derivation to smooth @xmath0-forms on @xmath4 and restricting the resulting @xmath1-forms to @xmath3 , we can observe the existence of nonzero square integrable @xmath1-forms on @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the holes in the carpet are not too small , then ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 ) applies ( see remark [ r : connect ] below ) and tells that within the @xmath2-space of @xmath0-forms the locally harmonic @xmath0-forms are dense in the orthogonal complement of the exact @xmath0-forms .",
    "here we call a square integrable @xmath0-form @xmath5 locally harmonic if we can find a finite open cover @xmath6 of @xmath3 and functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , harmonic in the dirichlet form sense , such that for any @xmath8 we have @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the exterior derivation .",
    "now assume there is a closed extension of the classical exterior derivation @xmath10 on @xmath0-forms to a closed and densely defined unbounded linear operator on the @xmath2-space of @xmath0-forms .",
    "since @xmath11 , its application to a locally harmonic @xmath0-form @xmath5 would give @xmath12 .",
    "therefore @xmath10 , seen in the @xmath2-sense , would give zero on its entire domain , seemingly contradicting the existence of nonzero square integrable @xmath1-forms .",
    "however , what we observe in this paper is that , roughly speaking , if the holes in a generalized carpet are not too small , then the exterior derivation on @xmath0-forms is not closable in the @xmath2-sense .",
    "so there is no contradiction , but an interesting difference between the classical and the @xmath2-formulation .    on carpets of positive two - dimensional lebesgue",
    "the exterior derivative on @xmath0-forms can be expressed using the curl operator .",
    "since our main motivation comes from quantum physics , especially @xcite , the closability of @xmath13 and the domain of definition of the adjoint operator @xmath14 , seen as operators between hilbert spaces , are of special interest .",
    "if the diameter of the holes in the carpet does not decrease too rapidly and the domain of @xmath13 contains all smooth vector fields , we can observe the non - closability of @xmath13 , see corollary [ c : notclosable ] .",
    "however , in this situation we can even state a stronger result , namely that the domain of its adjoint @xmath15 must be trivial , theorem [ thm01 ] .",
    "the proof of this theorem is elementary and graphical , based on the specific structure of generalized non - self - similar sierpinski carpets .",
    "we also prove a similar result in a more abstract setup .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 is a compact metric space , @xmath17 a finite radon measure on @xmath16 with full support and @xmath18 a strongly local regular dirichlet form on @xmath19 .",
    "we additionally assume that we are given a finite energy dominant measure @xmath20 for @xmath18 and an algebra @xmath21 of functions with @xmath20-essentially bounded energy densities that provides a special standard core for @xmath18 .",
    "it is always possible to find such measures and algebras .",
    "the @xmath2-space of @xmath0-forms can be defined without ambiguity . using the algebra @xmath21",
    "we can introduce an @xmath2-space of @xmath1-forms with respect to the measure @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath20-essential supremum of the dimensions of the corresponding abstract cotangent spaces , clearly integer valued , is referred to as the _ martingale dimension _ , @xcite .",
    "the second version of our result is stated for spaces that , in a certain way , have a similar structure as sierpinski carpets , see assumption [ a : carpetlike ] . theorem [ t : general ] states that under this assumption either the martingale dimension equals one or the exterior derivation on @xmath0-forms , considered on a certain dense initial domain , is not closable .",
    "the existence of a non - closable curl or , respectively , exterior derivation , may be seen as part of a discussion about the role of dimensions of metric measure spaces carrying a diffusion .",
    "the spectral dimension is most significant for elliptic and parabolic equations for scalar functions . for vector equations we already observed in @xcite that other structural properties may be relevant .",
    "there we promoted a version of a navier - stokes system on topologically one - dimensional spaces and observed its simplification to an euler type equation that has infinitely many nontrivial steady state unique weak solutions .",
    "we formulated the system in a way that assumes that there are no nontrivial @xmath1-forms .",
    "( note , however , that all other results in @xcite are absolutely independent of this question . )",
    "there exists an extensive literature that establishes the relation between function spaces on metric measure spaces and the theory of dirichlet forms .",
    "in particular the reader can consult the papers @xcite and references therein .",
    "our current paper is a step in a long - term program ( see @xcite ) to develop parts of differential geometry and their applications to mathematical physics ( see @xcite ) for spaces that carry diffusion processes but no other smooth structure .",
    "our approach is somewhat complementary to the celebrated works @xcite because , although our spaces are metrizable , we do not use any particular metric in an essential way , and we do not use functional inequalities",
    ". a different approach to the differential forms and the hodge - de rham theory on fractal graphs and fractals is introduced in @xcite .",
    "it will be a subject of future studies to establish the connection between @xcite and our work .    for symmetric bilinear expressions @xmath22 of two arguments @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 we use the notation @xmath25 for the associated quadratic expression @xmath26 . recall also that given a quadratic expression @xmath27 of one argument @xmath23 , polarization yields a symmetric bilinear expression @xmath28 of two arguments .",
    "the authors are very grateful to eric akkermans and gerald dunne for interesting and helpful discussions and to naotaka kajino and jun kigami for pointing out some necessary corrections .",
    "in this section we discuss prototype examples given by generalized sierpinski carpets and corresponding restrictions of the classical energy form and the classical curl on @xmath4 .",
    "we recall a construction studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath29 be a sequence of positive reals such that for any @xmath30 the number @xmath31 is an odd integer strictly greater than one .",

    "next , let @xmath37 be the family of all congruent closed subsquares of side length @xmath38 , touching only at the boundaries , obtained by subdividing each element of @xmath35 in a similar way as @xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] and discarding the central squares , respectively",
    ". set @xmath40 .",
    "further iteration of this construction process yields a decreasing sequence @xmath41 of nonempty compact sets @xmath42 . to @xmath43 we refer as the _ generalized sierpinski carpet associated with the sequence @xmath44_. for the constant sequence @xmath45 one obtains the classical sierpinski carpet .",
    "any @xmath46 is a compact subset of @xmath4 , and we consider @xmath46 with the relative topology ( induced topology )",
    ". then any nonempty open subset of @xmath46 is topologically one - dimensional .",
    "if @xmath47 , then any nonempty open subset of @xmath46 has positive two - dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath48 , see ( * ? ?",

    "let @xmath47 be fixed and consider @xmath52 .",
    "we write @xmath53 for the space of ( classes of ) functions on @xmath3 that are square integrable with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "the restriction to @xmath3 of the usual dirichlet integral , defined for any @xmath54 by @xmath55 extends to a local regular dirichlet form @xmath56 on @xmath53 .",
    "the last statement can be seen following arguments similar to the ones given in @xcite : for any rectifiable curve @xmath57\\to s$ ] and any @xmath58 the line integral @xmath59 of its gradient @xmath60 along @xmath61 equals @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath58 the function @xmath63 is the minimal upper gradient of @xmath64 , and since @xmath65 , any function @xmath58 is a member of the ( newtonian ) sobolev space @xmath66 in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2.5 ) , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.1 ) .",
    "moreover , there is some @xmath67 such that @xmath68 this implies the closability of @xmath69 in @xmath53 .",
    "its closure @xmath56 is regular , note that by tietze s extension lemma and local polynomial approximation the @xmath70-functions are dense in @xmath71 .    seen as a subset of @xmath4 ,",
    "the set @xmath3 is fairly complicated . in particular , the complement @xmath72 of @xmath3 is an open set that is everywhere dense , but does not have full lebesgue measure @xmath48 in any neighborhood of any point of @xmath3 .",
    "the topological boundary of @xmath3 in the topology of @xmath73 coincides with @xmath3 , that is , every point of @xmath3 is a boundary point if we consider the usual @xmath74 topology .    endowed with the induced topology , @xmath3 has no intrinsic boundary . note that , because of the remark in the next paragraph , there are no boundary terms in the green s formula on @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of the closed energy form @xmath56 has many remarkable consequences , including the existence of the unique non - negative self - adjoint laplacian @xmath75 on @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath48 restricted to @xmath3 .",
    "this laplacian @xmath75 can be defined weakly via the usual relation @xmath77 for @xmath24 in the domain of @xmath75 and @xmath78 .",
    "although this is formula can be considered a version of the classical green s formula , the laplacian @xmath75 is not given as the sum of the second derivatives of twice continuously differentiable functions .",
    "note also that although the domain @xmath79 of the dirichlet form @xmath76 can be identified with a version of a sobolev space , the domain of the laplacian @xmath75 maybe more complicated and is only weakly defined .",
    "in particular , the are no reasons to think that the domain of @xmath75 contains any non - constant @xmath80 functions ( see @xcite for some related questions ) .",
    "this is because in an open region with smooth boundary the domain of the laplacian consists of functions with vanishing normal derivative at the boundary , but in the case of @xmath3 with a dense complement @xmath72 , this would mean a really singular behavior of the derivative .",
    "in fact it is natural to conjecture that the domain of @xmath75 contains no non - constant @xmath81 functions restricted to @xmath3 .    in 2",
    "the curl is defined for a smooth enough vector field @xmath82 by @xmath83 of course we have in mind the usual relation @xmath84 which can be justified in the sense that one can consider a three - dimensional vector field @xmath85 and compute , in three dimensions , that @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is the third component of the three dimensional vector field @xmath88 .",
    "at the same time the @xmath13 operator can be described using the notion of exterior derivative @xmath89 of differential 1-forms in the sense that we have @xmath90 when discussing the situation on @xmath74 , we can identify vector fields @xmath91 and @xmath0-forms @xmath92 .    for a vector field",
    "@xmath93 with @xmath94 the function @xmath87 is continuous , its pointwise restriction to @xmath3 makes sense and is a member of @xmath53 . therefore @xmath95",
    "may be seen as a densely defined unbounded operator from @xmath96 into @xmath97 .",
    "we slightly reformulate this situation by endowing @xmath13 with a dense domain @xmath98 and asking what happens to the domain @xmath99 of its adjoint @xmath15 .",
    "this of course also decides whether @xmath100 is closable or not .",

    "the condition that @xmath47 forces the size of the holes to decrease sufficiently fast , condition ( [ e : condan ] ) on the other hand requires them not to decrease extremely fast .    if @xmath106 for all @xmath107 as in examples [ ex : simpleex ] , then @xmath47 and ( [ e : condan ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we believe that the condition [ ex : simpleex ] can be relaxed substantially , in particular using the methods of @xcite , but we present here only a simplified construction because it is sufficient for our purpose .",
