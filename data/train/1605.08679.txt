    ", alkali gases have proven to be an extremely versatile experimental tool , as the interaction strength can be tuned by feshbach resonance while the use of optical lattices permits to create highly controllable geometries .",
    "reduced dimensionality might lead to highly non - trivial phenomena in quantum systems .",
    "it was shown  @xcite by marvin girardeau in 1960 that in one dimension the wave function of bosons with strong repulsion can be mapped to a wave function of non - interacting fermions . in this system ,",
    "known as tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas , bosons acquire many fermionic properties revealing the intricate relation between quantum statistics in one dimension .",
    "later on , it was proposed  @xcite that a gas with even stronger correlations than in a tg gas ( super tonks - girardeau ( stg ) gas ) can be obtained by crossing rapidly the confinement induced resonance  @xcite .",
    "tonks - girardeau gas was successfully realized and observed with @xmath3rb  @xcite atoms and tg and stg gases with @xmath4cs  @xcite atoms .",
    "before the breakthrough progress was achieved with alkali atoms , the most studied candidate for observing bose - einstein condensation in cold gases was electron - spin - polarized hydrogen .",
    "a group led by thomas greytak and daniel kleppner at mit began their quest for the quantum degeneracy of atomic hydrogen already in 1978 .",
    "a magnetic trap with evaporative cooling was one of the techniques used by the group which later was adopted by the alkali gas laboratories .",
    "it took two decades to finally reach  @xcite the bose - einstein condensation in atomic hydrogen , in 1998 .",
    "we might hope that the experimental techniques developed since then for alkali gases can be backported to hydrogen for creating clean one- systems of hydrogen and its heavier isotopes , deuterium and tritium .",
    "in particular , the possibility for formation of a tritium condensate using its broad feshbach resonance was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our additional motivation is that , out of all atoms , hydrogen has the simplest structure and it is a very basic fundamental question to find out its properties in reduced dimensionalities .",
    "a further advantage of considering polarized hydrogen is that its interatomic potential is exactly known from works by kolos , jamieson , dalgarno , and wolniewicz  @xcite .",
    "as the model potential is the only input of quantum monte carlo methods , we can benefit of its power for producing very accurate quantitative results  @xcite .",

    "the density dependence of the luttinger parameter in @xmath2he in 1d @xcite is overall quite similar to that of deuterium and tritium , with a similar location of the maximum , at @xmath127@xmath35 .",
    "we find that the hydrogen , being the lightest atom in the periodic table , shows a dramatic dependence on the isotope mass .",
    "to conclude , we studied how the ground - state properties of one - dimensional hydrogen are affected by the isotope mass .",
    "the limit of ultra - low density corresponds to an ideal fermi gas for fermi - dirac statistics and to a tonks - girardeau gas for bose - einstein case . at high density ,",
    "a quasi - crystal is formed as manifested by strong oscillations in the two - body distribution function @xmath76 and diverging peak in the static structure factor @xmath77 .",
    "we extract the luttinger parameter @xmath96 from the linear behavior of @xmath77 when @xmath124 . based on a specific value of @xmath96",
    "we define different physical regimes including tonks - girardeau , bogoliubov bose , super - tonks - girardeau gases and quasi - crystal for bosons ; and ideal fermi gas , attractive and repulsive fermi gas , quasi - crystal regimes for fermions .",
    "a peculiarity of one - dimensional hydrogen is that due to girardeau s mapping for hard - core interactions , the energy and diagonal properties depend rather on mass and not on the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the isotope mass plays a non - straightforward role making the three species intrinsically different : the resulting @xmath36-wave scattering length @xmath40 is positive for @xmath0h leading to positive corrections to tonks - girardeau energy ( hard - rods or super - tonks - girardeau type ) ; @xmath40 is negative for @xmath1h and @xmath2h causing negative corrections ( lieb - liniger type ) .",
    "the most significant differences are observed in the case of tritium , where the mass is close to the value needed to form a bound state , causing large maximal values of the luttinger parameter .",
