    "compared to the atmospheres of hotter o and b stars that have stellar winds and to atmospheres of cooler f and g stars that have convective atmospheres , the atmospheres of a - type stars are relatively quiet , which enables the presence of various interesting phenomena .",
    "this calmness of atmospheres leads to the development of a number of different chemical peculiarities and magnetic field structures on long time scales .",
    "there exists a widely used grid of line blanketed lte model atmospheres ( kurucz @xcite , castelli & kurucz @xcite ) , which is also extensively used for a stars .",
    "besides this grid , several attempts to remove the inconsistent assumption of lte have been performed .",
    "the very first nlte calculation of a cool b star , which can be somehow understood as a first step toward a star modelling , was performed by auer & mihalas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the domain of a star temperatures was first reached by kudritzki ( @xcite ) and frandsen ( @xcite ) .",
    "a grid of nlte model atmospheres of stars with @xmath0 ( thus also including a part of the a star domain ) was calculated by borsenberger & gros ( @xcite ) .",
    "a great stride was made by huben ( @xcite , @xcite ) , who studied in detail the effect of the l@xmath1 line on the nlte model atmospheres of a stars and applied his code to star vega . a detailed analysis of the physics which is contained in releasing the assumption of lte was presented by huben ( @xcite ) .",
    "first nlte line blanketed model atmospheres of a stars were calculated using a method of superlevels and superlines by hubeny & lanz ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , although there was great progress in calculating nlte model atmospheres for hot stars and for white dwarfs , calculations of nlte model atmospheres of a stars are very rare .",
    "the only attempt of a nlte model atmosphere of an a - type star was the model calculated by hauschildt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for parameters corresponding to vega .",
    "the authors announced a grid of nlte models to be published , but till now nothing appeared .",
    "the inherent reason which stands tacitly behind the lack of calculated nlte a star model atmospheres is in the different scaling properties of the atmospheres of this stellar type .",
    "the atmosphere of a stars have very extended line formation regions meaning that different lines form at very different depths ( cf .",
    "fig.1 in lanz & hubeny , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore they are very difficult to describe by a simple standard depth discretization as compared to o stars and white dwarfs , and hence a much more elaborate depth scale has to be used .",
    "our own experience shows that there are severe convergence problems caused by improper depth scaling and only a tremendous number of depth points helped .",
    "a solution of a model atmosphere problem means taking the basic input values of stellar luminosity @xmath2 , stellar radius @xmath3 , and stellar mass @xmath4 ( or , equivalently for the usual plane - parallel case effective temperature and gravitational acceleration at the stellar surface @xmath5 ) , adding physical laws that are important in the stellar atmosphere ( a principal ingredient ) , and calculating the space distribution of various physical quantities ( temperature @xmath6 , electron density @xmath7 , population numbers @xmath8 , density @xmath9 , velocity field @xmath10 , etc . ) .",
    "this procedure is often being performed in substeps .",
    "the first step is the determination of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for the most important opacity sources .",
    "the second ( optional ) step is the determination of @xmath14 for the minor abundant species , often referred to as trace elements .",
    "the final step in this process is the calculation of the theoretical emergent radiation which may be then compared to the observed one .",
    "a standard model atmosphere here is a static one - dimensional ( plane - parallel or spherically symmetric ) atmosphere in hydrostatic , radiative , and statistical equilibrium . to calculate",
    "such a model atmosphere we need to solve the radiative transfer equation ( to determine the radiation field @xmath15 ) , the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( to determine @xmath13 ) , the energy equilibrium equation ( to determine @xmath11 ) , and the statistical equilibrium equations ( to determine @xmath14 ) .",
    "the radiative transfer equation is the principal equation for model atmosphere calculations .",
    "regardless of the geometrical approximation which is adopted , the basic solution of the radiative transfer equation is performed along a ray , which reads @xmath16 usually the simplest possibility , i.e. the plane - parallel atmosphere , is being used for the modelling of stellar atmospheres , basically due to its relative simplicity .      by formal solution of equation ( [ rteray ] )",
    "we mean the solution for a _ given _ opacity and emissivity .",
    "such a solution may be performed using either differential or integral methods .",
    "the latter are especially useful for the multidimensional case .",
    "the inconsistency of the formal solution is that opacity @xmath17 and emissivity @xmath18 are not given , but in the process of solving the model atmosphere problem they depend on temperature , density , and radiation field , which are to be determined when solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "however , the formal solution remains at the heart of each model atmosphere code ( see auer @xcite ) .",
    "the process of the formal solution may be expressed using the @xmath19-operator @xmath20 this expression may be used in an iterative process , where the source function @xmath21 is determined by solving the other constraint equations of hydrostatic , energy , and statistical equilibria . as has been shown , such a process , however effective for the optically thin cases of molecular clouds ( cf . dickel & auer @xcite ) , fails to produce a convergent solution for the optically thick cases of stellar atmospheres ( see auer @xcite ) .",
    "this problem has been overcome using the newton raphson method for model stellar atmospheres by auer & mihalas ( @xcite ) . as an efficient alternative ,",
    "an approximate @xmath19-operator may be used , @xmath22 the operator is constructed in such a way that it contains the basic physics of the problem and is simply calculable .",
    "the most efficient method is to calculate this operator consistently with the numerical method used for the formal solution , like it has been described by rybicki & hummer ( @xcite ) or puls ( @xcite ) . then the radiation field is determined by an iterative process , @xmath23 + \\left ( \\lambda_\\nu - { \\mbox{$\\lambda^\\ast_\\nu$}}\\right ) \\left [ s_\\nu \\left ( j_\\nu^{(n-1 ) } \\right ) \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath24 means the current iteration step and @xmath25 the previous one .",
    "the energy equilibrium equations determine the temperature structure .",
    "they describe the basic energy balance in the atmosphere . for the case of static atmospheres , the equation of radiative equilibrium , @xmath26 which simply describes the radiative energy balance ,",
    "is usually being used . however",
    ", this equation does not guarantee the radiative flux conservation , which results in an incorrect temperature structure at large optical depths .",
    "therefore , another form , which comes from @xmath27 , is to be used at large optical depths .",
    "better numerical properties of the scheme may be achieved if a linear combination of these equations is considered , as was first done by hubeny & lanz ( @xcite ) .",
    "another improvement of convergence properties , especially useful at low continuum optical depths where strong lines are still present , was introduced by kubt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) where a thermal balance of electrons instead of the radiative equilibrium equation is used",
    ".    then three different equations may be used in the stellar atmosphere to take into account energy equilibrium . in the deepest layers ,",
    "the differential form of radiative equilibrium is used . in the middle parts , where continuum radiation is formed",
    ", the integral form of radiative equilibrium works well . in the outer parts where optically thick lines coexist with an optically thin continuum ( which is the case of a star atmospheres ) , the thermal balance of electrons works best .",
    "a more detailed discussion with the numerical properties of these methods may be found in kubt ( @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of statistical equilibrium are the key equations both for the nlte model atmosphere and line formation problems .",
    "the set of equations for statistical equilibrium for the static case may be written as @xmath28 radiative rates @xmath29 are those responsible for the nlte effects , since they introduce nonlocal interaction and they alter the level population irrespective of local equilibrium conditions .",
    "they move the gas outside thermodynamic equilibrium . on the other hand , for an equilibrium ( maxwellian ) electron velocity distribution ( which is the common case )",
    ", collisional rates reintroduce thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the balance between collisional and radiative rates determines the applicability of the lte approximation .",
    "if collisions dominate , then the lte approximation is feasible .",
    "if radiative transitions dominate , which is the case in a star atmospheres , then equations of statistical equilibrium need to be solved if we want to obtain the correct population numbers .",
    "since the system of rate equations is linearly dependent , we have to close it with some other condition . for a reference ( usually , but not necessarily hydrogen ) atom either particle conservation equation @xmath30 or charge conservation equation @xmath31",
    "for other atoms , the abundance equation @xmath32 is usually used .",
    "detailed forms of the equations may be found , e.g. , in kubt ( @xcite ) .",
    "the whole system of equations is usually solved using a newton - raphson iteration scheme , which in modeling stellar atmospheres used to be referred to as linearization ( auer & mihalas @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation field is linearized as well , or it can be included using approximate lambda operators ( see eq .",
    "[ aliiter ] ) , as has been first done by werner ( @xcite ) .",
    "excellent reviews of ali methods of model atmosphere solutions are provided by hubeny ( @xcite ) and werner ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , an implicit linearization of @xmath33-factors saves additional computer time and memory ( anderson @xcite ) .",
    "the whole process may be accelerated using either kantorovich ( see hubeny & lanz @xcite ) or ng acceleration ( see auer @xcite ) .",
    "line blanketing is caused by enormous amounts of spectral lines in the uv region ( @xmath34 ) , mostly of iron and nickel .",
    "this enormous amount of lines causes radiation to be absorbed in the uv and reemitted in the visible region , thus changing the emergent flux and atmospheric structure significantly .",
    "there are two main approaches to line blanketing under the simplifying assumption of lte , the odf ( opacity distribution function ) and os ( opacity sampling ) .    if we do not use the assumption of lte , we have to solve the equations of statistical equilibrium to obtain the correct population numbers for all levels .",
    "this task is relatively simple for simple atoms ( like he ) , but becomes difficult for atoms with a complicated level structure , like iron . in order to cope with the complexity of these atoms , anderson ( @xcite )",
    "introduced the concept of superlevels and superlines .",
    "a superlevel is a level which is created by grouping several individual levels . in order to achieve a real simplification ,",
    "it is useful to group the levels in such a manner that the relative population distribution inside the superlevel obeys the lte distribution .",
    "thus , this grouping is done according to the energy , @xmath35 , of individual levels ( anderson @xcite , dreizler & werner @xcite ) .",
    "a more sophisticated grouping according to @xmath35 and parity was done by hubeny & lanz ( @xcite ) .",
    "dreizler & werner ( @xcite ) used opacity sampling in their calculations , whereas hubeny & lanz ( @xcite ) used the nlte opacity distribution function .      since the beginning of the nlte calculations there is a battle between lte people and nlte people , which of the approaches is better .",
    "if nlte model atmosphere is calculated as easily as the lte one , there would be no discussion and everybody would use the nlte one . however , this is not the case and it is much more difficult to calculate a nlte model than the lte model .",
    "two conflicting aims enter the scene .",
    "the first one is to analyse as many stars as possible , which can be hardly done using nlte models .",
    "the second one is to study stars as accurately as possible , which can be hardly done using lte models .    for the case of lte",
    "it is relatively easy to handle line blanketing , since one neglects the effect of radiation on atomic population numbers , which saves computing time enormously . on the other hand for a more general case of nlte , including",
    "line blanketing is computationally expensive , albeit nowadays it is possible to handle nlte calculations using sophisticated numerical methods and contemporary computers .",
    "however , for extended atmospheres the reliability of lte decreases and one is forced to use nlte .    to avoid repeated calculations of complicated model atmospheres",
    "one may take the advantage of precomputed grids .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that using such grids , which were calculated under certain physical assumptions , always limits the results by these assumptions .",
    ".list of nlte calculations for a given lte model atmosphere for a stars [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     computer codes used for calculations : 1  detail ( giddings @xcite ) ; 2  kiel ( steenbock & holweger @xcite ) ; 3  takeda ( @xcite ) ; 4  nonlte3 ( sakhibullin @xcite ) ; 5  multi ( carlsson @xcite ) ;    calculations of full nlte model atmospheres of a type stars is a difficult task . due to a large span of line formation regions down to optical depths in the continuum of about @xmath36 ,",
    "the numerical procedure becomes extremely unstable and calculations need special care .",
    "that is why people started to solve easier task of nlte line formation for a given model atmosphere .",
    "a necessary condition for such calculation to be reasonable , is negligible influence of the ion on the ionization balance and , consequently , on the global structure of the atmosphere .",
    "such elements are being referred to as trace elements .",
    "contemporary nlte analysis of a stars are mainly concerned with solving the statistical equilibrium equations for trace elements for a given ( mostly lte ) model atmosphere .",
    "these kind of calculations have already been reviewed by huben ( @xcite ) and hubeny & lanz ( @xcite ) , so only new calculations that appeared after the last review are listed in table  [ resnlt ] .",
    "we did our best to mention all calculations . in the case",
    "we unintentionally omitted some , we apologize for it .",
    "there are several codes available for this purpose .",
    "they use slightly different numerical techniques , basic differences are in the treatment of the radiation field . both the accelerated lambda iteration and complete linearization methods are used . a comparison of results from different codes for vega ( and sun ) was presented by kamp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who found large differences in the results different codes .",
    "therefore we added to table  [ resnlt ] an indication which code was used .",
    "in standard nlte calculations only the radiation field and level populations are allowed to deviate from their equilibrium values .",
    "the velocity distribution of individual species is still assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "collisional rates are then calculated as an average over the maxwellian electron velocity distribution , @xmath37 thus in equilibrium there holds a relation between collisional rates up and down ( excitation / deexcitation or ionization / recombination ) , @xmath38 if the velocity distribution is not maxwellian ( e.g. in electron beams formed in the sun during flares  cf .",
    "kaparov & heinzel @xcite ) , then the equation ( [ eqcij ] ) , which expresses the equilibrium condition , is not valid . in such a case",
    "the collisions may cause level population numbers to differ from the lte values , which has an observable effect on the line profiles .",
    "the nonthermal collisional term may be considered as another source of nlte effects .",
    "such effects are present in the sun , where the electron beams are formed after magnetic reconnection .",
    "there is also a possibility that they may be present in magnetic a stars , where releasing magnetic energy in eruptive events like flares may be expected as well .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields into model atmosphere calculations have been done only occasionally .",
    "an important attempt in calculating a model atmosphere with a magnetic field was done by carpenter ( @xcite ) , who found changes in the net gravity and pressure distribution due to the magnetic field .",
    "the most consistent model so far was recently developed by valyavin ( @xcite ) , who assumed lte and included the lorentz force into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ". a historical overview of magnetic model atmosphere calculations is also presented there .",
    "an important aspect of a star atmospheres is the fact that atmospheres of a good fraction of stars of this stellar spectral type are extremely quiet .",
    "such quiet atmospheres without significant global motions like global convection and stellar winds enable long time scale processes of diffusion and gravitational settling to take place .",
    "diffusion occurs not only in the presence of magnetic field ( note the effect of enhancing radiative acceleration in polarized radiation field and the effect of ambipolar diffusion , babel & michaud @xcite ) , but also due to different sensitivities of various atoms and ions to incoming radiation .",
    "radiative diffusion is able to explain various chemical peculiarities in cp stars and is also responsible for the isotopic shift effect ( aret & sapar @xcite ) . however , consistent nlte model atmospheres that take into account radiative diffusion processes are still missing for a type stars .",
    "nlte model atmospheres with diffusion were calculated by dreizler & shuh ( @xcite ) for white dwarfs , where diffusion processes are also important .",
    "the physical process of diffusion is reviewed in detail elsewhere in these proceedings ( michaud ) .",
    "plane - parallel model atmospheres are also being used for nlte modeling of atmospheres of a - type supergiants ( e.g. , kudritzki @xcite ) .",
    "however , they do not describe the limb darkening correctly .",
    "a - type supergiants have also stellar winds and show p cyg line profiles , therefore it is impossible to describe them using plane parallel atmospheres . also , wind models of a stars are not calculated too often .",
    "multicomponent hydrodynamic radiatively driven wind models for a stars were calculated by babel ( @xcite ) .",
    "another radiation driven wind model was calculated by achmad ( @xcite ) , but they did not take into account non - lte effects .",
    "generally , for extended atmospheres the nlte effects are stronger .",
    "an attempt to calculate spherically symmetric nlte model atmospheres with a stellar wind of deneb was done by aufdenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . however , as the authors note , they were not able to fit the observed h@xmath1 line profile .",
    "work on developing consistent nlte wind models of a supergiants is currently in progress ( krtika & kubt , these proceedings ) .",
    "an important property of emergent radiation from stellar atmospheres is the angle dependence of the specific intensity @xmath39 , usually called limb darkening .",
    "approximate limb darkening laws are often used ( see , e.g. , allen , @xcite or gray , @xcite ) .",
    "these approximate laws do nt describe the angular dependence of the specific intensity very well even in the case of thin stellar atmospheres .",
    "in addition , limb darkening is strongly frequency dependent ( hadrava & kubt @xcite ) , and in the center of a line , even limb brightening instead of darkening may appear , as can be seen in figure[okrajtenkytlusty ] .",
    "this effect becomes very strong especially for extended stellar atmospheres .    for a correct description of limb darkening it",
    "is necessary to use model atmospheres with a better geometry than plane - parallel .",
    "this has been done by claret & hauschildt ( @xcite ) , who , using a spherically symmetric code , calculated limb darkening for a grid of model atmospheres from a to g spectral types .",
    "knowledge of an accurate limb darkening law is necessary for detecting stellar spots ( see kjurkchieva , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also very important for the analysis of interferometric measurements , as well as for the correct treatment of stellar rotation .",
    "luckily , eclipses from binaries ( e.g. , twigg @xcite ) , and the gravitational microlensing effect ( heyrovsk @xcite ) measurements of limb darkening are possible for at least some of the distant stars .",
    "stellar rotation is usually being accounted by convolving the rotation profile with the static line profile ( see gray @xcite ) .",
    "this technique is inaccurate not only due to using only approximate limb darkening laws , but also because the dependence of limb darkening on frequency as well as gravity darkening are neglected .",
    "a more accurate method is to integrate the static intensity over the rotating disc of the star , where gravity darkening can also be included .",
    "a `` simple '' way of including gravity darkening in this integration is described by collins ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method was used by gulliver ( @xcite ) to determine the rotation of vega .",
    "stellar rotation is not like a rigid body rotation , as it is usually assumed , but it is probably differential . until now , there are only few measurements of differential rotation .",
    "unfortunately , in many works , the authors use the simplest form of the limb darkening law and the obtained results can be used only with reservations .",
    "for an exact description of stellar rotation the plane - parallel model atmosphere is insufficient .",
    "it is necessary to use a hydrodynamic multidimensional model atmosphere , at least an axially symmetric one together with the correct description of the radiation field .",
    "recently , we started to work on such a model ( korkov , these proceedings ) .",
    "full nlte model atmospheres of a stars are difficult to calculate , since the lines of different ions form at very different depths , and therefore there is a need for a huge amount of depth points to resolve all line formation regions sufficiently .",
    "only lte model atmospheres together with nlte calculations for individual ions have been calculated in significant amounts .",
    "this underlines the need for more intensive calculations of nlte model atmospheres of a stars .",
    "adding consistently new different physical processes to nlte model atmospheres calculations , such as diffusion ( see michaud , these proceedings ) , magnetic fields ( see moss , these proceedings ) , and more accurate treatment of convection zones ( see kupka , these proceedings ) , is necessary .",
    "this is the real challenging task the near future .",
