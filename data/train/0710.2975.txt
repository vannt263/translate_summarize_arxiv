    "as noted in section 3 , the condition that the solutions belong to the space @xmath253 is equivalent to the requirement that the values of the solutions for large @xmath18 belong to a three - dimensional subspace of @xmath254 , which , up to exponentially small terms , is defined as @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 ( cf . with ( [ approx1 ] )  ( [ approx3 ] ) ) .",
    "problem ( [ 4.1 ! ] ) , ( [ cond0 ] ) , ( [ 4.2!])([4.4 ! ] ) is self - adjoint .",
    "taking into account item 1 of section 3 , we immediately find that , for @xmath258 , @xmath259 is its only eigenvalue ( of multiplicity 3 ) , and that the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by ( [ eig1 ] )  ( [ eig3 ] ) . for @xmath16 different from @xmath260 ,",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath261 has multiplicity 2 , with the corresponding eigenfunctions being given by ( [ eig5 ] ) and ( [ eig6 ] ) , and , as computations show , the third zero eigenvalue starts to move to the region of negative values .",
    "the eigenvalue is sought numerically by transferring boundary conditions ( [ 4.2 ! ] )  ( [ 4.4 ! ] ) from the point @xmath262 to the point @xmath96 and examining the changes of sign of the resulting determinant .",
    "note that , in this case , a variant of the sweep method is used @xcite ( with regard to the studies on the robust use of orthogonal sweep methods in singular problems @xcite ) .",
    "our computations show that , when @xmath263 varies from @xmath264 to zero , the double zero eigenvalue remains unchanged , whereas the single eigenvalue ( which is just the eigenvalue @xmath265 we are interested in ) moves to the region of negative values ( fig .",
    "the comparison of these results with ( [ mumin ] ) shows that the bound obtained analytically is too high .",
    "for example , for @xmath266 , the value of @xmath267 found numerically is equal to 0.45 , whereas ( [ mumin ] ) yields 1.8 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath268 , the magnitude of @xmath267 is greater than @xmath269 ( see estimate ( [ estim1 ] ) and fig .",
    "2 ) , which complicates the localization of the eigenvalues of problem ( [ equ1])([condint ] ) ( see below ) .      now , let us consider problem ( [ equ1 ] )  ( [ condint ] ) itself .",
    "its reduction to a problem defined on a finite interval is similar to that for the previous problem for the ode ( [ 4.1 ! ] ) .",
    "representation ( [ approx1 ] )  ( [ approx3 ] ) yields the following boundary conditions at @xmath262 : @xmath270 @xmath271 @xmath272 where the roots are assumed to have positive real parts .",
    "the nonsingular spectral problem ( [ equ1 ] )  ( [ cond0 ] ) , ( [ inf1 ] )  ( [ inf3 ] ) was studied numerically by a method based on the generalization of the argument principle ( methods of localization of descrete spectrum points based on the argument principle and its modifications are discussed , for example , in @xcite  @xcite and in references therein ) with the use of the differential sweep @xcite ( as noted earlier , the problems of the robust application of the method from @xcite , as well as other modifications of the sweep method , to singular eigenvalue problems are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "conditions ( [ inf1 ] )  ( [ inf3 ] ) are represented in the form @xmath273 where @xmath274 and @xmath275    as a result of the sweep , we obtain a condition at the point @xmath96 with the @xmath276 matrix @xmath277 equivalent to ( [ infall ] ) , ( [ varphi ] ) .",
    "if we augment thi matrix up to a square one by adding the lower matrix block corresponding to conditions ( [ cond0 ] ) , eigenvalue problem can be formulated as follows :    a number @xmath136 is an eigenvalue @xmath278 the determinant of the resulting matrix is equal to zero ; + the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue ( i.e. , the number of linear independent eigenfunctions ) is equal to the defect of the resulting matrix .",
    "note that the coefficients of the matrix @xmath277 and , hence , the determinant of the resulting matrix , are not analytic functions of @xmath136 .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in @xcite , the argument principle can still be used for determining the number of the eigenvalues in a given region of the spectral parameter @xmath136 .",
    "the search can rely on the determinants @xmath279 for the first condition and @xmath280 for the second condition in ( [ cond0 ] ) , respectively , where @xmath281 is the minor of the matrix @xmath277 composed of the columns @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
    "the zeros of det@xmath285 correspond to the eigenvalues of problem ( [ equ1 ] )  ( [ cond0 ] ) , ( [ inf1 ] )  ( [ inf3 ] ) . the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the multiplicity of the corresponding zero of the determinant .    from the computational results ,",
    "it follows that when @xmath16 is close to @xmath264 , the search domain for unstable eigenvalues is a circle of radius @xmath286 centered at the origin ( see ( [ estim4 ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath16 approaches zero , the search domain is the same circle with the cuts along the real axis from @xmath269 to the right and from @xmath287 to the left ( see ( [ estim1 ] ) ) .",
    "the critical difficulty associated with this problem is that the points lying on the cuts belong to the continuous spectrum ( when @xmath136 is close to the cuts , the computation becomes unstable ) .",
    "thus , the methods of the localization of the eigenvalues described in @xcite@xcite can not directly be applied to our problem , since the resulting determinant ( or some other function used in the argument principle ) can not continuously be extended to the boundary of the domain .",
    "( note only that , if there were descrete eigenvalues appearing in the intervals of the continuous spectrum , they would develop somehow when @xmath16 varies ; however , the computation did not reveal anything of this kind near the cuts when @xmath16 varied . )    from the problem symmetry , it follows that the eigenvalues with nonzero real and imaginary parts are located in the complex @xmath136-plane by quadruplets ( @xmath288 ) and those with only real or imaginary nonzero parts , by pairs on the real or imaginary axis , respectively .    to study perturbations of the degenerate eigenvalue @xmath289 and reveal the presence / absence of complex eigenvalues , we made computations on the following contours in the @xmath136-plane :    circles of radius varying from @xmath290 to @xmath291 , where @xmath290 is a small number , centered at @xmath292 ;    circular sectors of the angle 90@xmath293 with the vertex at @xmath294 and radius @xmath286 located in the first quadrant ( the eigenvalue symmetry property is used ) ;    intervals lying on the real or imaginary axis ;    separate contours outside the real axis .",
    "the computations show that , in the degenerate case of @xmath295 , the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath292 is equal to four , and its geometric multiplicity is equal to three ( cf . with ( [ eig1 ] )  ( [ eig3 ] ) ) .",
    "the difference in the two multiplicities is explained not by the presence of jordan block ( which is impossible in view of the self - adjointness of the boundary value problem ) but by the fact that eq .",
    "( [ equ3 ] ) contains the square of the spectral parameter @xmath136 .    when @xmath16 varies from @xmath260 to 0 , the following picture is observed .",
    "as before , the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath292 is equal to 4 .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the eigenvalue @xmath292 is not split into several eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , when @xmath16 is close to @xmath260 , it follows from the results obtained that the problem has no other eigenvalues .",
    "when we move from @xmath295 , the geometric multiplicity reduces from 3 to 2 ( instead of eigenfunctions ( [ eig2 ] ) , ( [ eig3 ] ) we have ( [ eig5 ] ) ) .",
    "the reduction of the geometric multiplicity upon the perturbation of a parameter is a typical phenomenon for quadratic pencils ( in contrast to linear ones ) .",
    "eigenfunctions ( [ eig1 ] )  ( [ eig3 ] ) for @xmath295 and ( [ eig5 ] ) , ( [ eig6 ] ) for other @xmath16 are found numerically with accuracy up to @xmath296 . as @xmath16 approaches zero ,",
    "problem ( [ equ1 ] )  ( [ condint ] ) becomes more stiff . in the computations with fixed ( double ) relative accuracy , the lowest value of @xmath16 was as small as 0.05 .    for additional stability control for the eigenvalue @xmath292 , we used the following consideration . from the symmetry of the eigenvalues and the existence of the eigenfunctions ( [ eig5 ] ) , ( [ eig6 ] )",
    ", it follows that , at least , the property of being repeated for the eigenvalue @xmath292 is conserved .",
    "hence , the perturbation could accur only through splitting of two symmetric eigenvalues along one of the axis .",
    "we have checked numerically that this effect did not take place ( with regard to estimates ( [ estim1 ] ) and ( [ estim3 ] ) ) .",
    "no other eigenvalues have been found in the numerical experiments .    it may be concluded ( with the greatest certainty for the interval @xmath16 : @xmath297 ) that the singular boudary value problem , ( [ equ1 ] )  ( [ condint ] ) has only one eigenvalue @xmath292 of algebraic multiplicity 4 and geometric multiplicity 2 with the corresponding eigenfunctions ( [ eig5 ] ) , ( [ eig6 ] ) .",
    "no complex eigenvalues have been found in the admissible domain ( [ estim4 ] ) .",
    "the analytical and numerical studies reported in this paper allow us to conclude that solution ( [ phisol ] ) , ( [ xisol ] ) is dynamically stable with respect to small perturbations of form ( [ deltaxi ] ) , ( [ deltaphi ] ) for @xmath298 .",
    "this statement has the greatest certainty in the interval @xmath16 : @xmath297 .",
    "moreover , solution ( [ phisol ] ) , ( [ xisol ] ) in the course of its evolution can not split into small nonlocalized oscillations ( along the component @xmath2 ) over kink ( [ wall ] ) since it is not advantageous from the energy standpoint .",
    "the question of whether the topological q - ball ( [ phisol ] ) , ( [ xisol ] ) is absolutely stable in the sector @xmath68 is still open .",
