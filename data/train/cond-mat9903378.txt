    "the phase behaviour of hard particles , in particular spheres , as a simple model of interacting particles , has received much attention .",
    "computer simulations of monodisperse hard spheres show a first - order transition between a dilute disordered phase ( fluid ) and a dense ordered phase ( solid )  @xcite .",
    "the continuous translational symmetry of the hamiltonian remains intact in the fluid , but is broken to a discrete subgroup in the solid .",
    "although a rigorous proof is lacking , this phase transition in the hard sphere model is now generally accepted .",
    "for bidisperse hard spheres the situation is more complicated .",
    "the existence of several solid phases has been established ; see for example  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the behaviour in the fluid phase , however , is not known . using the percus ",
    "yevick closure of the ornstein ",
    "zernike equation , lebowitz and rowlinson  @xcite found miscibility in all proportions for all diameter ratios .",
    "more recently however , biben and hansen  @xcite , using the rogers  young closure , found a spinodal instability when the diameter ratio exceeds  5 . even so it might be that the fluid ",
    "fluid transition is pre - empted by the fluid  solid transition , so that the former does not actually occur .",
    "thus it remains an open question whether bidisperse spheres can show a fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation .",
    "more generally one may ask if gas  liquid  solid behaviour can occur in binary mixtures with only hard - core repulsion .    motivated by this interest van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker  @xcite studied a two - dimensional binary hard - core lattice model .",
    "this model , introduced by frenkel and louis  @xcite , consists of large and small hard hexagons on a triangular lattice , see figure  [ fig : hexagons : model ] .",
    "every site can be empty or occupied by a large or small hexagon , and if it is occupied with a large hexagon all its direct neighbours must be empty . when the small particles are omitted",
    ", one regains the hard hexagon model  @xcite , which has been solved exactly by baxter  @xcite ; it has a second - order ordering transition .",
    "van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker studied the binary model by means of monte  carlo simulation .",
    "they found three phases : dilute disordered ( gas ) , dense disordered ( liquid ) , and ordered ( solid ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hexagons : duin ] shows this phase diagram , represented in terms of the fugacities @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the large and small hexagons , respectively .",
    "in this paper we study the same model by different methods .",
    "our interest is in the qualitative , rather than quantitative , aspects of the phase diagram .",
    "we do not address the general question whether gas  liquid  solid behaviour is possible in binary hard - core mixtures .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first we briefly review the monte carlo approach of van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker , and we give some exact results .",
    "then we describe our numerical transfer matrix calculations .",
    "next we discuss the relation of the model with an exactly solvable rsos model and with the dilute three - state potts model .",
    "finally we propose an explanation for the discrepancy between our results and those of van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker .",
    "before we review the monte  carlo method of van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker  @xcite and discuss some exact results , we make the following notational conventions : the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the large and small hexagons , respectively ; the superscript 0 refers to the pure hard hexagon model ; the symbol @xmath2 without subscript is the number of sites and is generally omitted as an argument of the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we consider the semi - grand canonical partition function @xmath3 of large hexagons , whose number @xmath4 is fixed , and small hexagons , whose fugacity @xmath1 is fixed , on @xmath2 lattice sites .",
    "we may view the small hexagons as causing an effective so - called depletion interaction  @xcite between the large hexagons .",
    "the question is then if this attractive depletion interaction is strong enough to induce a fluid  fluid transition .",
    "the effective interaction can be expressed in the number of sites available for small hexagons , once the large hexagons have been placed on the lattice .",
    "interestingly , the sites available for small hexagons are exactly the sites where an additional large hexagon could be inserted .",
    "such sites are called free .",
    "it is easy to express the semi - grand canonical partition function @xmath3 in terms of the canonical partition function @xmath5 of the hard hexagon model and the probability distribution @xmath6 for the number @xmath7 of free lattice sites in the hard hexagon model : @xmath8 where @xmath9 after taking logarithms this gives the free energy : @xmath10 van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker determine the probability distribution @xmath11 from canonical monte carlo simulations of the hard hexagon model .",
    "to determine accurately the wings of the distribution an umbrella sampling technique is employed .",
    "they calculate @xmath12 from @xmath11 , and for fixed @xmath1 fit a polynomial in @xmath13 to this quantity .",
    "they obtain the free energy @xmath14 from ( [ equ : hexagons : freeen ] ) , using baxter s exact result  @xcite for @xmath15 and the fitted polynomial for  @xmath12 .",
    "the fugacity @xmath0 of the large hexagons and the pressure @xmath16 are calculated in the usual way from  @xmath14 .",
    "finally phase equilibrium is determined by looking for phases with equal @xmath0 and @xmath16 but different  @xmath17 . as this calculation",
    "is carried out for fixed  @xmath1 , @xmath1 is also equal in the phases .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : hexagons : duin ] .",
    "it has three branches : liquid  solid , gas  solid and gas  liquid .",
    "the branches meet at the three - phase point , at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "( van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker use the term `` triple point '' , but as that suggests the coexistence of three phases where three first - order transitions meet we prefer to use the term `` three - phase point '' . ) the gas  liquid end - point is located at @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "expanding @xmath22 to first order in @xmath1 gives : @xmath23 for a finite system we could have written @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 , but in the thermodynamic limit this is not valid at the phase transition of the hard hexagon model .",
    "lekkerkerker ( unpublished ) found that the average @xmath26 can be calculated exactly , as follows .",
    "adding one hexagon to a configuration of @xmath4 hexagons can be done in @xmath7 ways . by doing this to all configurations of @xmath4 hexagons each configuration of @xmath27 hexagons",
    "is obtained exactly @xmath27 times .",
    "hence @xmath28 which in the thermodynamic limit yields @xmath29 this is an example of widom s famous particle - insertion formula  @xcite . in the appendix",
    "we apply this exact result in the method of van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker . in particular",
    "we show that the existence of a van der waals loop can not be concluded from its presence in the first order approximant  ( [ equ : hexagons : exa ] ) .",
    "as the first derivatives of the thermodynamic functions with respect to @xmath1 are known in this way , we shall now attempt to calculate the locus of the phase transition in this order .",
    "the difference between the large and small hexagons is , that two small hexagons may occupy neighbouring sites , whereas two large ones may not . at small @xmath1",
    "the density of small hexagons is low , so that they will generally occur isolated .",
    "thus they can not be distinguished from the large ones . for the grand canonical partition function",
    "this implies : @xmath30 this suggests that the locus of the phase transition is given by @xmath31 where the superscript @xmath32 refers to the critical point of the pure hard hexagon model .",
    "the particle densities follow also : @xmath33 for the large hexagons , and similarly for the small ones .",
    "combining these results yields the density of the large hexagons at the phase transition : @xmath34 equations ( [ equ : hexagons : locz ] ) and ( [ equ : hexagons : locrho ] ) can not be derived rigorously from ( [ equ : hexagons : pfun ] ) alone , but we conjecture that they are nevertheless valid .",
    "now we study the model through its row - to - row transfer matrix . for practical reasons , we work with sawtooth rows as shown in figure  [ fig : hexagons : xfer ] .",
    "one advantage is that the high density ground state of the hexagons fits on the lattice ( which has an even number of sites ) , whereas for straight rows it does so only when the system size is a multiple of three .",
    "another advantage is that the transfer matrix can be built up by repeatedly adding one site , without increasing the total number of sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the rows .",
    "the number of `` teeth '' is denoted by @xmath35 , so a row contains @xmath36 sites and has length @xmath37 .",
    "the largest few eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ( in the zero - momentum sector ) were calculated numerically for @xmath38 ,  ,  @xmath39 , using the power method .    in the ordered regime",
    "there are in fact three coexisting ordered phases , corresponding to the three sub - lattices of the triangular lattice .",
    "they give rise to three eigenvectors of the transfer matrix , dominated by these ordered phases : one symmetric and two asymmetric for permutations among the ground states .",
    "the symmetric vector has the largest eigenvalue  @xmath40 .",
    "the asymmetric vectors have a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues @xmath41 and  @xmath42 .",
    "in the region of the phase diagram we are interested in , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , together with another real eigenvalue  @xmath43 , turn out to be the largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix .",
    "the phase behaviour can be diagnosed from the behaviour of the gaps between the eigenvalues , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as the system size @xmath46 tends to infinity .",
    "the gap @xmath47 is an inverse correlation length between density fluctuations . in the absence of a phase transition ,",
    "the bulk ( @xmath48 ) value of this length is finite and the value for finite @xmath46 approaches this bulk value when @xmath46 tends to infinity .",
    "hence @xmath47 tends to a non - zero limit . at a critical point",
    "the bulk correlation length diverges and the value for finite @xmath46 is proportional to  @xmath46 . as a consequence of scale invariance @xmath47 decreases as  @xmath49 . at a first - order transition with a change in the density , however , @xmath47 is not an inverse correlation length .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath40 and @xmath43 are then asymptotically degenerate .",
    "their gap @xmath47 is related to the interfacial tension between the coexisting phases .",
    "more precisely , @xmath47 decays as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is proportional to the interfacial tension  @xcite .    for the gap  @xmath52",
    "the situation is analogous . in the disordered regime",
    ", it is an inverse correlation length , here between fluctuations in the sub - lattice ordering .",
    "thus the gap approaches a non - zero value as @xmath46 grows . at a first - order transition between two disordered phases",
    "this correlation length is generally different in the two phases .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath52 undergoes a sharp change through the transition , approaching a jump as the system size @xmath46 increases . at a critical point",
    "the bulk correlation length diverges , so that @xmath52 decays as @xmath49 when @xmath46 increases . in the ordered regime three phases coexist , and the eigenvalues @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( and @xmath42 ) are asymptotically degenerate : @xmath52 decays exponentially with  @xmath46 . at a first - order transition between an",
    "ordered and a disordered phase by the same token @xmath52 vanishes exponentially with  @xmath46 .",
    "we shall now distinguish between two scenarios : ( i ) there are two phases ( fluid and solid ) as in figure  [ fig : hexagons : phases](a ) ; ( ii ) there are three phases ( gas , liquid and solid ) as in figure  [ fig : hexagons : phases](b ) .",
    "the gaps should behave as follows . at fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "the gap @xmath52 decreases with increasing  @xmath0 , whereas @xmath47 has a minimum at the phase transition(s ) . for low @xmath1 , see the lower dashed lines in figures [ fig : hexagons : phases](a ) and [ fig : hexagons : phases](b ) , the scaled gaps @xmath53 and @xmath54 will tend to a non - zero value when @xmath55 at the critical line . for high @xmath1 , see the upper dashed lines , this is no longer the case : both scaled gaps tend to zero when @xmath55 at the phase transition , which is now first - order . on the middle dashed line in figure  [ fig : hexagons : phases](b ) , @xmath52 changes rapidly at the gas - liquid transition .",
    "furthermore @xmath47 has two minima : at the gas - liquid transition and at the liquid - solid transition .",
    "when @xmath55 , the minimum of the scaled gap @xmath54 tends to zero at the gas  liquid transition , but to a non - zero value at the liquid",
    " solid transition .",
    "thus the gas - liquid transition in figure  [ fig : hexagons : phases](b ) can be recognised from the appearance of a sudden change in @xmath52 and a second minimum of  @xmath47 .    for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , ",
    ",  @xmath58 the scaled gaps @xmath53 and @xmath54 were plotted as function of  @xmath0 for @xmath38 ,  ,  @xmath39 .",
    "figures [ fig : hexagons : mlo][fig : hexagons : thi ] show examples of this .",
    "we found no indication that @xmath47 has two minima .",
    "one could argue that two minima might be fused to a single one for these relatively small systems ; however , the sharpest and deepest minimum ( at the gas  liquid transition ) is clearly absent .",
    "this pleads against the three - phase scenario in favour of the two - phase scenario .",
    "we also saw no sudden change in  @xmath52 .",
    "however , even if a gas  liquid transition were present , the signal in @xmath52 might be hard to detect .",
    "the three - phase scenario can be obtained by introducing an extra parameter into the model .",
    "assign a weight @xmath59 to every lattice edge joining a small hexagon and an empty site . for @xmath60",
    "one recovers the original model . for @xmath61",
    "any contact between a small particle and an empty site is forbidden . in this",
    "limit the model either contains no small hexagons at all or is completely filled with them .",
    "the regime without small hexagons still exhibits the hard hexagon transition as long as @xmath62 is smaller than the partition sum per site of the hard hexagon model . beyond this value",
    "the phase filled with small particles takes over .",
    "thus the ordered and disordered hard hexagon phases meet with the pure small hexagon phase , where the phase transition between them terminates in a three - phase point . for",
    "@xmath59 close to zero the model will still obey the three - phase scenario . here",
    "@xmath47 is indeed found to have two minima , see figure  [ fig : hexagons : tkappa ] .",
    "( the maxima in this figure at first sight seem to be crossings of eigenvalues , but a very close look reveals that they are in fact rounded . ) this supports our interpretation of the absence of a second minimum in @xmath47 as evidence against the three - phase scenario .",
    "the locus in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane of the phase transition can be estimated for example as the location of the minimum of  @xmath47 . for fixed @xmath1",
    "the value of @xmath0 at which this gap takes its minimum was determined .",
    "the results for @xmath63 and @xmath64 are plotted in figure  [ fig : hexagons : minz ] . in order to obtain the locus in the @xmath17@xmath1 plane the density of large hexagons",
    "was computed using @xmath65 ( it should be noted that for such small @xmath35 this does not seem to be very accurate . )",
    "figure  [ fig : hexagons : minrho ] shows the result .",
    "we observed that for fixed @xmath1 the graphs of @xmath17 versus @xmath0 for different system sizes pass approximately through one point .",
    "one could ask whether this is the critical point , as would be the case in a self - dual model .",
    "the locus of the intersection of the graphs for @xmath63 and @xmath64 is shown in figure  [ fig : hexagons : minrho ] .",
    "figures [ fig : hexagons : minz ] and  [ fig : hexagons : minrho ] also show the phase diagrams given by van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker  @xcite .",
    "first - order and second - order transitions are not easily distinguished from each other by the numerical data . in both cases",
    "@xmath47 has a minimum , only the dependence on @xmath46 of the depth of the minimum is different . for @xmath66 , the graphs of the @xmath53 pass",
    "approximately through one point , see figure  [ fig : hexagons : mlo ] .",
    "the @xmath54 have a minimum that increases slowly with  @xmath46 and may converge to a non - zero value , see figure  [ fig : hexagons : tlo ] .",
    "this points to a second - order transition . for @xmath67 , the graphs of @xmath53 do not pass neatly through one point ,",
    "see figure  [ fig : hexagons : mhi ] .",
    "the minimum of @xmath54 decreases with  @xmath46 and may vanish asymptotically , see figure  [ fig : hexagons : thi ] .",
    "this points to a first - order transition .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath53 and @xmath54 changes gradually between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath1 at the tricritical point is estimated roughly to lie between 1.7 and  2.3 .    by universality",
    "the limit values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the phase transition are @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 on the hard hexagon critical line ( @xmath72 ) , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the hard hexagon tricritical point ( @xmath75 ) , see for instance  @xcite . on the critical line close to the critical point one",
    "expects to find the tricritical values for small system sizes , but the critical values for large sizes .",
    "the limits were also estimated from the graphs of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath56 ( not shown ) and @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath56 we found @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the critical values @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "for @xmath66 we found @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this agrees reasonably with the tricritical values @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are expected for small system size near the tricritical point .",
    "some properties of the large - and - small hexagon model it has in common with an exactly solvable model . in order to make use of the exact solution we investigate if the two models are ever parametrically close .",
    "the sites of the large - and - small hexagon model can be in three states : 0 ( empty ) , 1 ( large hexagon ) , or 2 ( small hexagon ) . for neighbouring sites",
    "the combinations 11 and 12 are excluded .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath81 case of the exactly solvable @xmath80 restricted solid - on - solid model of kuniba  @xcite .",
    "this is an interaction - round - a - face model on the square lattice . for a suitable choice of its spectral parameter ,",
    "the condition on neighbouring sites extends to one of the diagonals of the square face . the boltzmann weight of the square face then factors into weights of the composing triangles : @xmath82 and these triangle weights are invariant under rotation : @xmath83 so that the model is isotropic on the triangular lattice .",
    "the model still has one parameter ( the elliptic nome ) , but this solvable line stays away from our phase diagram .",
    "for example at the critical point the triangle weights are @xmath84 which is not of the form @xmath85 application of the numerical transfer matrix method from section  [ sec : hexagons : transfer ] to this critical model shows that it is in the tricritical three - state potts universality class .",
    "the large - and - small hexagon model is intimately related to the dilute three - state potts model  @xcite .",
    "because this relation gives insight in the phase diagram we will consider it here in more detail .",
    "on every site @xmath86 of a two - dimensional lattice with coordination number @xmath87 lives a variable @xmath88 that can take the values 0 , 1 , 2 ,  3 . of these the states",
    "@xmath89 take the role of local occupancy of one of the three sub - lattices of the hard hexagon model , and the state @xmath90 is neutral or vacant .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dilute potts model is @xmath91 where the first sum is over nearest neighbour pairs of sites . in the parameter space @xmath92",
    "the model has a line of tricritical points as well as a line of critical - end - points  @xcite , see figure  [ fig : hexagons : potts ] . as we will argue below",
    ", it is fairly clear where these come together , namely in the critical point of the four - state potts model , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where all the four states are treated identically .    at @xmath96",
    "there is a dilute phase with @xmath90 when @xmath97 , while the three dense , or ordered phases associated with @xmath98 coexist when @xmath99 .",
    "these phases extend to non - zero temperatures so that a first - order surface separates the dilute region from the dense coexistence region .",
    "this first - order surface will not remain precisely at @xmath100 for @xmath101 , but by symmetry it does include the @xmath102-axis , @xmath103 . at high temperature the coexistence region is bounded by a surface of three - state potts critical points , shaded gray in figure  [ fig : hexagons : potts ] , where the line tension between the coexisting dense phases vanishes .",
    "this critical sheet must join with the first - order surface in a line of multicritical points , as they both form boundaries to the coexistence region .",
    "the nature of this multicritical line depends on the sign of @xmath104 , as follows .",
    "along the first - order sheet we can distinguish two line tensions , namely that between two different dense phases , and that between a dense and the dilute phase .",
    "when @xmath105 the interface between the dilute and the dense phases costs less energy than that between two of the dense phases .",
    "however on the critical surface the line tension between the dense phases vanishes . as a consequence",
    "all line tensions vanish simultaneously where the critical and first - order sheets meet as @xmath105 .",
    "the separatrix between these two types of phase transition is thus a tricritical line .",
    "when @xmath106 the dense ",
    "dense interface costs less energy than the dense ",
    "dilute interface , so there remains a positive line tension between the dilute phase and the dense phases where the first - order sheet meets the critical surface , and the dense  dense interfacial tension vanishes .",
    "this results in a critical - end - point scenario : the three - state potts critical sheet terminates where it hits the first - order sheet .",
    "the first - order sheet extends beyond this line , separating a disordered dense phase from the dilute phase .",
    "obviously , at @xmath93 the two scenarios come together , and we conclude that the tricritical curve and the critical - end curve as well as the critical line terminating the dilute  disordered phase transition all meet in the four - state potts critical point , marked as a dot in figure  [ fig : hexagons : potts ] . this qualitative description of the phase diagram of ( [ equ : hexagons : dp ] ) , though not rigorous , is the simplest possible scenario , and has been corroborated by numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "these considerations are of interest for the large - and - small hexagon model because that can be mapped onto a model sufficiently similar to the dilute potts hamiltonian ( [ equ : hexagons : dp ] ) that the arguments can be carried over .",
    "we divide the triangular lattice into triangular blocks of three sites each , indicated in figure  [ fig : hexagons : blocks](a ) .",
    "each block then has three sites which we label 1 , 2 , and  3 .",
    "we assign a spin variable @xmath88 to each block , as follows .",
    "when the site @xmath51 in block @xmath86 is occupied by a large hexagon , the spin variable takes the value @xmath107 , while in all other cases @xmath90 . for convenience of notation",
    "we consider one block variable @xmath108 , in interaction with six neighbours @xmath88 with @xmath109 , as shown in figure  [ fig : hexagons : blocks](a ) .",
    "the blocks @xmath86 with @xmath110 contain two sites neighbouring the site @xmath86 of the central block , and the block @xmath111 sits in the opposite direction .",
    "to give an expression for the interaction we introduce the variables @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a permutation of @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath115 can only take the values 0 and  1 , and it signals if site @xmath116 of the central block is free .",
    "the spin states 1 , 2 , and 3 have weight @xmath0 , but are excluded by some configurations of the neighbouring blocks by the factor @xmath117 .",
    "\\label{equ : hexagons : excl}\\ ] ] in other words the state @xmath118 is not allowed when @xmath119 .",
    "the weight of the spin state @xmath120 depends on the surrounding blocks and is given by the expression @xmath121 if this model would be precisely the dilute potts model with hamiltonian ( [ equ : hexagons : dp ] ) we could simply read off the value of @xmath104 and its sign would conclusively decide between a tricritical point versus a three phase point .",
    "the interaction is of course much more complicated than that of the dilute potts model , but the overall effect is that some combinations of unequal nearest neighbours are excluded or suppressed .",
    "as the state 0 is treated altogether different from the states 1 , 2 , and 3 , it is difficult to judge the sign of the effective coupling @xmath104 in  ( [ equ : hexagons : dp ] ) .",
    "however , this problem can be resolved because there is a model in the universality class and with the symmetry of the four - state potts model which can be mapped to a very similar model .",
    "consider a one - species lattice gas on the triangular lattice in which not only first neighbours but also second neighbours ( at distance @xmath122 ) can not be occupied simultaneously .",
    "we will refer to this model as the big hexagon model . for large values of the fugacity",
    "@xmath123 this model will be in an ordered phase in which one out of four sub - lattices is occupied preferentially . at low fugacity",
    "the symmetry between the sub - lattices is unbroken .",
    "the phase transition is known to be in the four - state potts universality class from the symmetry of its landau  ginzburg  wilson hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of studies giving the critical fugacity of this model , but we have seen numerically that it is about half the value of the hard hexagon model .    the big hexagon model can be mapped exactly onto a potts - like model very similar to the model above , as expressed in ( [ equ : hexagons : excl ] ) and  ( [ equ : hexagons : w2hex ] ) .",
    "now we take blocks of four sites as shown in figure  [ fig : hexagons : blocks](b ) , one in each sub - lattice .",
    "it is convenient to label the spins in each block by the numbers 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 as indicated .",
    "when the site @xmath86 in a block is occupied , the block variable takes the value  @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , when none of the sites are occupied , the block variable is taken to be  0 .",
    "therefore the weight of the states @xmath110 is @xmath123 and the weight of state 0 will again depend on the states of the neighbouring blocks .",
    "we again consider a block variable @xmath108 interacting with its neighbours , which are labelled in the same way as in the previous case .",
    "we will use again variables @xmath115 defined by ( [ equ : hexagons : varp ] ) .",
    "the central site of the block 0 is free if and only if @xmath124 .",
    "some combinations of states of neighbouring blocks are excluded , described by precisely the same expression ( [ equ : hexagons : excl ] ) as before .",
    "however , also some combinations of next - neighbouring blocks are excluded .",
    "for example site @xmath86 of block @xmath111 and site @xmath125 of block @xmath126 in figure  [ fig : hexagons : blocks](b ) are second neighbours , so the combination @xmath127 and @xmath128 is excluded .",
    "we introduce a variable    @xmath129    note that @xmath130 can only take the values 0 and  1 ; it signals if there are no pairs @xmath127 and @xmath128 . if @xmath131 then @xmath127 or @xmath128 is already excluded by the interaction between the neighbouring blocks 0 and @xmath111 or  @xmath126 .",
    "therefore the exclusion of the combination @xmath127 and @xmath128 can be taken into account by including a factor @xmath130 in the weight of block 0 in state  0 .",
    "this weight is then given by @xmath132 in this way any exclusion between sites of next - neighbouring blocks is absorbed in the weight of state 0 of the intervening block .",
    "this resulting model is strikingly similar to the potts - like model above .",
    "the exclusion rules for pairs of neighbouring blocks are identical and when we choose @xmath133 , the weight of the spin states 1 , 2 , and 3 is the same . in both models",
    "the weight of the state 0 depends on the configuration of its six neighbours , via expression ( [ equ : hexagons : w2hex ] ) and ( [ equ : hexagons : bigw ] ) , respectively .",
    "when we further specify @xmath134 the weights for @xmath120 are equal in the case that @xmath135 and  @xmath136 .",
    "in particular they are equal when the surrounding blocks are also in state 0 , because then @xmath124 and @xmath136 .",
    "it is the exclusion and suppression of configurations with unequal neighbours which determines an effective temperature @xmath102 and coupling @xmath104 in  ( [ equ : hexagons : dp ] ) .",
    "the large - and - small hexagon model and the big hexagon model with the parameters as set above will have the same effective temperature @xmath102 , as all configurations involving only spin states @xmath137 have the same weight between the two models .",
    "only when a block has @xmath138 , while one or more of its neighbours have @xmath137 , the configurational weights between the two models can be different . in all such cases the weight in the big hexagon model is smaller than that in the large - and - small hexagon model , which is easy to see from direct comparison of the expressions ( [ equ : hexagons : w2hex ] ) and ( [ equ : hexagons : bigw ] ) .",
    "therefore we can confidently claim that the effective coupling @xmath104 is the greater in the big hexagon model , as configurations with unequal neighbours of which one @xmath138 are more strongly suppressed than in the large - and - small hexagon model .",
    "however , since the big hexagon model has the symmetry of the four - state potts model , clearly its effective coupling @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the effective @xmath104 in the large - and - small hexagon model is necessarily negative , which , as argued above , results in a tricritical scenario .",
    "the results of our transfer matrix calculations provide evidence against the three - phase scenario of figure  [ fig : hexagons : phases](b ) in favour of the two - phase scenario of figure  [ fig : hexagons : phases](a ) .",
    "this contradicts the earlier findings of van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker  @xcite .",
    "we propose the following explanation .",
    "van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker effectively calculate the free energy difference between the binary mixture and the pure hard hexagons .",
    "they then look for phases of equal pressure and fugacities but different composition .",
    "they do not calculate the order parameter for the mixture .",
    "their method has some drawbacks .",
    "firstly , it can not detect second - order transitions , because these do not involve a jump in the particle densities .",
    "secondly , it uses a polynomial fit for the free energy difference , so that the total free energy still seems to possess the singularity of the pure hard hexagon model .",
    "thirdly , whether @xmath16 exhibits a van der waals loop or not may depend sensitively on @xmath6 .",
    "thus the locus of the liquid ",
    "solid branch in their phase diagram is a spurious consequence of the implicit assumption that the ordering transition remains at fixed  @xmath17 for small values of  @xmath1 .",
    "their qualitative conclusion that a gas  liquid transition is present relies on quantitative properties of the calculated phase diagram , viz .",
    "the locations of the various branches .",
    "figure  [ fig : hexagons : minz ] suggests that their gas  liquid and gas  solid branch together form the true fluid  solid line and that the critical point of their gas  liquid branch is in fact the tricritical point .",
    "this agrees well with the fact that figures [ fig : hexagons : minz ] and  [ fig : hexagons : minrho ] show enhanced size dependence of the phase diagram near their gas  liquid critical point .",
    "however , this point is located at @xmath21 ( and @xmath18 ) , whereas we estimate roughly @xmath139 for the tricritical point .",
    "being unable to present a satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy , we stress that our data do not signal a clearly determined locus of the tricritical point .",
    "it should also be noted that in our transfer matrix calculations only very small system sizes have been considered .",
    "going to significantly larger systems might allow for more definitive quantitative statements , but this requires much greater computational resources .",
    "other evidence comes from the relation with the dilute three - state potts model .",
    "the large - and - small hexagon model can be mapped onto a potts - like model .",
    "another model , the big hexagon model , whose phase behaviour is known , can also be mapped onto a potts - like model .",
    "a comparison of the effective temperature and coupling constants between the large - and - small hexagon model on the one hand and the big hexagon model on the other hand indicates that the large - and - small hexagon model should follow the two - phase scenario .",
    "we thank jeroen van duijneveldt and henk lekkerkerker for useful discussions .",
    "the former kindly provided data used in making figures [ fig : hexagons : minz ] and  [ fig : hexagons : minrho ] .",
    "this work was supported by the foundation fundamenteel onderzoek der materie .",
    "it is instructive to follow the method of van duijneveldt and lekkerkerker using ( [ equ : hexagons : exa ] ) and ( [ equ : hexagons : exb ] ) instead of monte carlo results .",
    "calculating the pressure from ( [ equ : hexagons : exa ] ) gives @xmath140 baxter  @xcite lists expansions around the critical point of several thermodynamic quantities of the pure hard hexagon model .",
    "combining these expansions with ( [ equ : hexagons : exb ] ) and ( [ equ : hexagons : exc ] ) yields @xmath141 this suggests that for small non - zero values of @xmath1 the pressure @xmath16 would exhibit a van der waals loop , so that the transition becomes first - order as soon as @xmath1 becomes non - zero . that this argument is not valid can be seen by considering for example @xmath142 which we view as a function of @xmath143 , parametrically dependent on  @xmath123 .",
    "expanding @xmath144 to first order in @xmath123 gives @xmath145 and for all non - zero values of @xmath123 the function @xmath146 of @xmath143 is decreasing between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "it is , however , a first order approximant of @xmath149 , which for all values of @xmath123 is an increasing function of  @xmath143 ."
