    "by this talk i would like to call an attention to the possibility of scalar leptoquarks and scalar gluons relating to the four color quark - lepton symmetry to be relatively light .",
    "apparently each of us is interested in a question what kind of the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) can exist at more high energies and how this new physics can manifest itself at the energies of the present and future colliders .",
    "one of the possible variants of such new physics can be the variant induced by the possible four color symmetry @xcite between quarks and leptons .",
    "the immediate consequence of this symmetry is the prediction of the new gauge particles  vector leptoquarks with the masses of order of the mass scale @xmath4 of the four - color symmetry breaking . in dependence on the model",
    "the lower limit on @xmath4 can vary from @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite in gut models with the four - color symmetry as an intermediate stage of symmetry breaking to @xmath7 @xcite or to @xmath8 or less in the models regarding the four - color symmetry as a primery symmetry @xcite    it should be noted however that the four - color symmetry can manifest itself not only by the vector leptoquarks but also due to the new scalar particles such as scalar leptoquarks @xcite or scalar gluons @xcite . in particular , in addition to the vector leptoquarks the four color symmetry with the higgs mechanism of splitting the masses of quarks and leptons ( mqls - model , @xcite ) predicts @xcite the scalar leptoquarks and the scalar gluons of the doublet structure under the electroweak @xmath9-group . in this approach",
    "these doublets are responsible for splitting the masses of quarks from those of leptons and they are the partners of the standard higgs doublet .",
    "what can we say about the masses of these scalar doublets ?",
    "these particles could manifest themselves through the radiative corrections . as is known if the new particles are relatively heavy ( @xmath10 ) their contributions into electroweak corrections can be approximately accounted by the formalism of the @xmath11 parameters of peskin and takeuchi @xcite .",
    "the current experimental data @xcite give the next values of @xmath12 which can be induced by a new physics @xmath13 where the central values assume @xmath14 and the change for @xmath15 is shown in parentheses .",
    "the @xmath16 parameters are normalized so that in sm they are equal to zero ( @xmath17 ) .    in this talk",
    "i would like to discuss the bounds on the masses of the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets wich are imposed by the current @xmath12 data ( [ eq : stue ] ) .",
    "the mqls - model to be used here is based on the @xmath18-group and predicts the new gauge particles ( vector leptoquarks @xmath19 with electric charge @xmath202/3 and an extra neutral @xmath21 boson ) as well as the new scalar ones @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector of the model contains in general the four multiplets @xmath22 transforming according to the ( 4,1,1 ) , ( 1,2,1 ) , ( 15,2,1 ) , ( 15,1,0 ) representations of the @xmath18-group and having the vacuum expectation values @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 respectively . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath29 indexes and @xmath30 is the @xmath31 one .",
    "the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be discussed here belong to the ( 15,2,1)-multiplet @xmath34 .",
    "this multiplet together with ( 1,2,1)-multiplet @xmath35 generates the fermion masses by higgs mechanism and splits the masses of quarks from those of leptons .    below we consider the scalar leptoquark doublets in the case of the the simplest scalar leptoquark mixing and with neglect of the small parameter @xmath36 of the model . in this case",
    "the scalar leptoquark doublets can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the mass eigen states of the scalar leptoquarks with electric charge 2/3 and @xmath39 is the scalar leptoquark mixing angle .",
    "the scalar gluon doublets in general case can be written as @xmath40 where the charged fields @xmath41 and the neutral fields @xmath42 are the mass eigen state fields ( in general case the real and imaginary parts @xmath43 of the down component of the doublet @xmath44 can be splitted in the mass ) .",
    "the contributions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 into @xmath51 from the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets have been calculated and analysed in ref.@xcite . in the case of the scalar doublets of the forms ( [ eq : spsm ] ) , ( [ eq : fj ] )",
    "the resulting contributions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 depend on seven masses and on the mixing angle @xmath55 .",
    "the contributions @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the scalar leptoquark doublets are not positive definite due to the @xmath56- mixing and can be negative if @xmath57 are between @xmath58 and @xmath58 and the contributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are also not positive definite and they are negative if @xmath59 is between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the masses of the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets are generated by the higgs mechanism of the symmetry breaking from the scalar potential @xmath62 including the interactions of these doublets with the standard higgs doublet . in this case",
    "we obtain some relations between the masses of scalar particles and the coupling constants of the scalar potential . as a result",
    "we have the new eight independent parameters of the model @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the coupling constants describing the interactions of the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets with the standard higgs doublet .    for the stability of the vacuum",
    "the coupling constants in the scalar potential are supposed below to satisfy some conditions ensuring the positiveness of the scalar potential @xmath65    for validity of the perturbation theory the coupling constants in the scalar potential can not be too large .",
    "we suppose below that all the coupling constants in the scalar potential do not exceed some maximal value @xmath66 ensuring the validity of perturbation theory . in the further numerical analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves by the values of @xmath67 from the region @xmath68 which give the reasonable values of the perturbation theory expansion parameter of order @xmath69 .",
    "varying the fitting parameters ( [ eq : par ] ) we minimize @xmath70 defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the experimental errors in ( [ eq : stue ] ) .    to clear up the possible effect of the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets on @xmath51 we vary the masses of these particles so that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a lower limit on the masses of these particles .",
    "after minimization of @xmath70 under condition ( [ eq : mlower ] ) we have analysed the dependence of @xmath75 on this lower limit @xmath74 and on upper limit @xmath66 on the coupling constants of the scalar potential .",
    "the fig.1 shows @xmath76 as a function of the lower limit @xmath77 for @xmath78 ( the curves 1 ) and for @xmath79 ( the curves 2 ) at @xmath80 ( the curves @xmath81 ) for the case without scalar leptoquark mixing ( @xmath82 , this case is slightly preferred by @xmath70 minimum ) .",
    "the horizontal lines denote @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the compatibility of the sm zero values of @xmath51 with the experimental data ( [ eq : stue ] ) at @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "as seen from the fig.1 the lower limit @xmath77 on the masses of the scalar leptoguarks and of the scalar gluons is allowed by data ( [ eq : stue ] ) to vary within wide limits from high values when the contributions from these particles into @xmath51 are negligibly small to values of order of @xmath85 or less .",
    "it is interesting that in both cases the more light particles agree with the data ( [ eq : stue ] ) even slightly better than in the sm . for @xmath78 ( the curves 1 ) such slight improvement of the agreement takes place for @xmath86",
    "whereas in the case of @xmath79 ( the curves 2 ) such improvement is seen in all the region of the lightest masses of order of 1 tev or less and it is more appreciable also for @xmath86 .",
    "this improvement at @xmath86 takes place due to the mutual cancellation of the contributions into @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the scalar leptoquarks with those from the scalar gluons .",
    "in particular the scalar leptoquarks with the lightest masses of order of @xmath89 ( and for @xmath90 ) are compatible with the data ( [ eq : stue ] ) at @xmath91 for @xmath92 in comparison with @xmath93 in the sm .",
    "the mass of the lightest scalar gluon in this case is expected to be @xmath94 .",
    "the lightest scalar leptoquark masses of order @xmath95 are compatible with the experimental limits resulting from the direct search for the leptoquarks .",
    "the most stringent of these limits are resulted from the pair production and for the scalar leptoquarks of the first generation they give @xcite @xmath96 under assuming the branching ratios @xmath97 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that in the model under consideration the coupling constants of the scalar leptoquark doublets with the fermions ( and those of the scalar gluon doublets ) are proportional to the ratios of the fermion masses to the sm vev @xmath98 ( @xmath99 , the general form of this interaction can be found in ref.@xcite ) and for ordinary quarks these coupling constants are small .",
    "the dominant decay modes of such leptoquarks are the modes with heavy quarks ( predominantly with t - quark ) whereas the branching ratio for the first generation is small @xmath100 .",
    "so the lower experimental limit on the masses of such scalar leptoquarks can be near the lowest value in ( [ eq : mlqe ] ) , the masses of the other scalar leptoquarks are in this case compatible with other experimental limits ( including those for the second and for the third generations ) resulting from the direct search for leptoquarks .",
    "it should be noted also that the light scalar leptoquarks can be also compatible with the indirect leptoquark mass limits resulting from the rare decays of @xmath101 type . due to",
    "the smallness of the coupling constants of the scalar leptoquark interaction with d- and s- quarks @xmath102 , @xmath103 the contributions of the scalar leptoquarks into @xmath101 width can be sufficiently small to satisfy the stringent experimental limit @xmath104 @xcite on the branching ratio of this decay , even for the relatively light masses of the scalar leptoquarks .",
    "finally the data on @xmath105 physics seemingly do not exlude the relatively light scalar leptoquarks . in the case of one degenerate scalar leptoquark doublet",
    "these data give the lower limit on its mass of about @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "thus , the current direct and indirect mass limits for leptoquarks do not exclude the relative light scalar leptoquark doublets considered here whereas the experimental data on @xmath107 not only allow the existence of such particles but even slightly prefer them to have the masses of order of @xmath86 . keeping in mind the sizable magnitude of the coupling constants of the scalar doublets with t - quark ( @xmath108 )",
    "the search for such scalar leptoquarks and scalar gluons in the processes with t - quarks at lhc is of interest .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of the so light new particles can also affect the new physics at high energies . in particular",
    "these particles can affect the gauge coupling constant unification in gut approaches .",
    "the mass scale evolution of the running coupling constants @xmath109 , @xmath110 of electromagnetic ( under the appropriate normalization ) , weak and strong interactions can be described in one loop approximation by the equations @xmath111 where @xmath112 are the corresponding factors of the @xmath113-functions expansion . in sm @xmath114 and the sm without any new physics up to the gut mass scale @xmath115 ( `` grand desert '' )",
    "do not unify three coupling constants at any mass scale ( see the lines 1 in fig.3 ) .",
    "but such a unification can be possible if an intermediate new physics below @xmath115 ( such as the four color symmetry physics with mass scale @xmath4 ) is assumed .",
    "for example in the model under consideration in the case of the scalar sector containing , for simplicity , only the standard higgs doublet and the ( 4,1,1 ) multiplet @xmath116 with vev @xmath117 we obtain for @xmath118 the resulting contributions @xmath119 from the vector leptoquarks and from the multiplet @xmath116 so that all three coupling constants do converge in one point at @xmath120 with @xmath121 ( the lines 2 in fig.3 ) .",
    "the account of the scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets with the masses of order of 1 tev or less gives for @xmath122 the additional contributions @xmath123 so that in this case all three coupling constants @xmath124 do also converge in one point if @xmath125 and @xmath120 with @xmath126 ( the lines 3 in fig.3 ) . as seen the presence of the relatively light scalar leptoquark and scalar gluon doublets ( with mases below 1 tev ) lowers the four color symmetry mass scale @xmath4 and increases the value of the unified coupling constant @xmath127 , leaving the gut mass scale @xmath115 practically unchanged .",
    "in conclusion we can say that the existence of the relatively light scalar leptoquarks and scalar gluons ( with masses of order of 1 tev or less ) is consistent with the current experimental data on s , t , u , the more light particles ( with masses below 400 gev ) even slightly improve the fit .    in particular the scalar leptoquarks with the masses of order of @xmath89 are consistent with current data on s , t , u for @xmath128 with @xmath129 ( in comparison with @xmath130 of the sm ) .",
    "the lightest scalar gluon in this case is expected to lie below @xmath131      * acknowledgments * the author is grateful to organizing commitee of the international seminar `` quarks-2002 '' for possibility to participate in this seminar .",
