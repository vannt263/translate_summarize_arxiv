    "in the past polarization data have often been the graveyard of fashionable models .",
    "measurements of the polarized deep - inelastic structure functions of the nucleon over the last decade have once again borne out this experience .",
    "while the naive quark parton model has been very successful in predicting the gross features of hadrons , it was a surprise to find that it fails to explain the spin properties of the nucleon .",
    "there is significant interest in an _ ab initio _ calculation of the nucleon structure functions now .",
    "the theoretical framework of such a calculation is the operator product expansion .",
    "while the wilson coefficients can be computed perturbatively , the hard part of the calculation is the determination of the forward nucleon matrix elements of the operators .",
    "this is a non - perturbative problem , and the technique to solve it is lattice qcd . for recent work on the subject",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "a confrontation of the experimental data with the lattice predictions will be a crucial test of our understanding of the structure of the nucleon .    at the twist two level the quark sector of the nucleon",
    "is completely specified by the spin averaged structure functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the polarized structure functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "in this talk we will report on new results of the polarized structure functions .    the talk is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the notation . in sec .",
    "3 we give the results for the moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we furthermore give an extrapolation of the axial vector coupling of the nucleon , @xmath7 , to the continuum limit .",
    "the moments can be converted into real structure functions by an inverse mellin transform .",
    "we will present first results on @xmath5 in sec .",
    "4 . finally , in sec .  5",
    "we conclude .",
    "the structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 have simple parton model interpretations .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 measures the quark helicity distribution in a longitudinally polarized nucleon , while @xmath1 measures the probability of finding a quark in a spin eigenstate of the operator @xmath8 in a transversely polarized nucleon .    in the following",
    "we shall consider only _ non - singlet _ structure functions and distributions .",
    "only these distribution functions are accessible in quenched lattice qcd .",
    "let us first consider the structure function @xmath0 . if the sea is assumed to be flavor symmetric , the leading twist contribution can be written @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the probability distribution of a quark of flavor @xmath12 and spin parallel ( anti - parallel ) to the parent spin of the nucleon .",
    "the so - called splitting functions @xmath13 are determined by the wilson coefficients @xmath14 through an inverse mellin transform .",
    "similarly , the distribution functions can be derived from their moments , @xmath15 we denote the lowest moment by @xmath16 according to the operator product expansion the moments are given by forward nucleon matrix elements of local operators .",
    "for @xmath17 we have @xmath18 , \\label{axmat}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 here @xmath20 means symmetrization .",
    "the lowest moment @xmath21 measures the _ axial vector charge _ of the nucleon .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for the structure function @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "one simply has to replace @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability distribution of a quark of flavor @xmath12 and spin @xmath8 parallel ( anti - parallel ) to the spin of the nucleon , giving @xmath25 we denote the lowest moment by @xmath26 the moments are given by the matrix elements @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28    the lattice operators , which are computed at the scale @xmath29 ( @xmath30 : lattice constant ) , must be renormalized and brought into the same scheme in which the wilson coefficients have been calculated .",
    "generically we can write @xmath31    where the indices distinguish between the various lattice operators which can ( and do ) mix under renormalization .",
    "it is a task of its own to compute the renormalization constants accurately . for details of the calculation",
    "we refer the reader to the literature  @xcite and the talk of schiller  @xcite .",
    "the lowest moment @xmath32 measures the _ tensor charge _ of the nucleon . in the non - relativistic quark model axial vector and tensor charges are equal , i.e. @xmath33 . the structure function @xmath1 has opposite chiral properties to @xmath0 .",
    "it can be measured in polarized drell - yan processes , but not in deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering .",
    "for other ideas see  @xcite .",
    "the quantities to be computed on the lattice are the moments ( [ del ] ) and ( [ del ] ) .",
    "we have new results on @xmath21 and @xmath7 , on @xmath34 and on @xmath32 . in the quenched approximation , which we are using , @xmath35 , and",
    "we write @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the following",
    "we drop the argument @xmath38 from the quark distributions .      in lattice calculations",
    "one imagines the high frequency modes higher than the cut - off being integrated out .",
    "the logarithmically singular contributions of these modes are absorbed into the bare parameters , such as the coupling constant , while the power - behaved contributions are usually left unaccounted for . for wilson fermions , which are widely used ,",
    "the power corrections are of @xmath40 . by improving the action",
    ", these corrections can be reduced to @xmath41  @xcite , thus giving results which are closer to the continuum limit @xmath42 .",
    "removing @xmath40 effects from the matrix elements requires improving the operators as well . for the axial vector current the improved operator , and its renormalization constant , have been derived recently  @xcite .",
    "we will make use of these results here .",
    "we have done calculations at two values of the coupling , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , corresponding to lattice spacings of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath47 and @xmath48 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ deltaud ] .",
    "the values given refer to the chiral limit , i.e. zero quark mass , which are obtained from the lattice data by a suitable extrapolation .",
    "as the remaining errors are of @xmath41 , we may fit the cut - off dependence by a formula of the form @xmath49 , and use this formula to extrapolate the result to the continuum ( @xmath42 ) limit .",
    "the outcome is shown by the solid lines .",
    "clearly , we would have liked to have at least one more data point at another value of the coupling .",
    "we are working on that .",
    "we compare our results with the phenomenological valence quark distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "the agreement is good , considering that the errors on the phenomenological values are of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "a quantity , which is known very precisely experimentally , is the axial vector coupling of the nucleon , @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ ga ] we show our results for @xmath7 , together with the extrapolation of the lattice data to the continuum limit .",
    "we find the continuum result to be in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "this figure indicates quite clearly how important it is to correct for finite cut - off effects . even after improving the action and",
    "the operators , cut - off corrections can be quite substantial still .",
    "we see that the lattice result increases by approximately @xmath52 going from our coarsest lattice at @xmath43 to the continuum limit .      the moments @xmath54 , @xmath55 have been computed using the improved action , but so far the operator has not been improved .",
    "we are currently working on this problem .",
    "for the renormalization constant we have taken the tadpole improved  @xcite one - loop perturbative result  @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath40 corrections have not completely been removed in this case , as opposed to the previous case .",
    "the result of the calculation is shown in fig .",
    "this work adds another value of @xmath56 to our previous calculation  @xcite .",
    "before we discuss the result , let us find out what the tensor charge actually tells us about the structure of the nucleon .",
    "for a stationary nucleon the operator ( [ ten ] ) differs from ( [ ax ] ) by a factor of @xmath57 . in the non - relativistic limit fermions",
    "are in eigenstates of @xmath57 , and so @xmath53 and @xmath39 are equal . by comparing @xmath53 and @xmath39 for a real nucleon , we can gain insight into how relativistic the constituents are .    comparing @xmath53 and @xmath39 in figs .",
    "[ deltaud ] , [ ddel ] now , we see that they are equal within the error bars .",
    "this shows that a non - relativistic description of the spin structure of the nucleon is quite adequate .",
    "does this mean that the quarks are in a relative s - wave and the missing spin is coming from the gluons and the sea quarks ?",
    "further investigations will have to show .    because the operator ( [ ten ] ) with @xmath58 is odd under charge conjugation",
    ", sea quarks do not contribute to @xmath53 .",
    "this means that we might hope that the quenched calculation is giving an answer close to the true value .",
    "another quantity which receives contributions from the valence quarks only is the second moment @xmath59 .",
    "this moment is found from the @xmath58 case of eqs .",
    "( [ axmat ] ) , ( [ ax ] ) .",
    "again , the reason is that the operator is odd under charge conjugation .",
    "the special feature of this moment is that it is directly accessible experimentally , which allows us to test the valence quark distribution without further phenomenological analysis .",
    "for the polarization asymmetry  @xcite of @xmath60 minus @xmath61 inclusive cross sections one finds to lowest order in @xmath62 @xmath63 for a proton target , and @xmath64 for a deuteron target .",
    "the fragmentation functions , as well as the sea quark contributions , drop out because of isospin invariance relating the various fragmentation functions with each other .",
    "the polarization asymmetries have been measured by the smc - collaboration . for the lowest moment of the valence quark distribution they found  @xcite @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the experimental errors are still a little too large to make a quantitative comparison with the lattice results .",
    "the smc - collaboration has recently extended their analysis to the second moment  @xcite . at @xmath67",
    "they obtain the result @xmath68 a recent lattice calculation , renormalized at the same scale , gives  @xcite @xmath69 the lattice and experimental results agree within their respective errors .",
    "the @xmath70-dependence of the structure functions carries valuable information about the dynamics of quarks and gluons which is not immediately available from the moments .",
    "furthermore , because of limited experimental data , moments are sometimes hard to compare with experiment .",
    "this is , in particular , the case for the higher moments .",
    "theoretically , the structure functions can be obtained from the moments by an inverse mellin transform .",
    "a first attempt of constructing nucleon structure functions from a few lower moments was reported in @xcite for the unpolarized case . in this talk",
    "we shall consider a +    different method and apply it to @xmath0 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the coarser lattice at @xmath43 .",
    "we have computed the three lowest moments .",
    "calculation of a fourth moment is possible .",
    "the moments can be well described by the formula @xmath71 this formula seems also to describe the moments of the unpolarized structure functions well .",
    "a fit is shown in fig .  [ moms ] .",
    "an inverse mellin transform of ( [ fit ] ) gives @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ stru ] we compare the result for @xmath73 with the phenomenological distributions .",
    "the outcome is encouraging .",
    "we have hope that with one more moment and precise lattice data we are able to derive phenomenologically useful quark distribution functions .",
    "it must be said that one can only combine even and odd moments to make a single structure function if @xmath74 and @xmath75 sea quark contributions are assumed to be equal , as is commonly done  @xcite .",
    "however , this may not be a good approximation  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations of nucleon structure functions have improved in many respects .",
    "the calculations are now done with improved actions and using improved operators , so as to reduce cut - off effects .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization constants of the lattice operators , which are another source of errors , are gradually being computed non - perturbatively  @xcite . on top of that",
    ", we have seen that it is important to do the calculation at several values of the coupling and do an extrapolation to @xmath42 . by adding one or two more data points , and with increased statistics",
    ", we will soon be ready to report reliable continuum results , at least in the quenched approximation .",
    "where we can compare the lattice results with experiment or the phenomenological analysis , we find good agreement .",
    "our efforts over the last year have , in particular , paid off for @xmath7 , the axial vector coupling of the nucleon .",
