    "this question is far more important than whether wigner deserved a nobel prize for this paper alone .    for many years since 1963 , many people claimed that wigner s 1939 paper is worthless because he did not get the nobel prize for it",
    "let us respond to this fatalistic view .",
    "einstein did not get the prize for his formulation of special relativity in 1905 .",

    "@xcite , wigner considered the subgroups of the lorentz group whose transformations leave the four - momentum of a given particle invariant .",
    "these subgroups are called wigner s little groups and dictate the internal space - time symmetries in the lorentz - covariant world .",
    "he observed first that a massive particle at rest has three rotational degree of freedom leading to the concept of spin .",
    "thus the little group for this massive particle is like @xmath0 .",
    "how about this massive particle moving in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "we could settle this issue easily .",
    "wigner observed also that a massless particle can not be brought to its rest frame , but he showed that the little group for the massless particle also has three degrees of freedom , and that this little is locally isomorphic to the group @xmath2 or the two - dimensional euclidean group .",
    "this means that generators of this little group share the same set of closed commutation relations with that for two - dimensional euclidean group with one rotational and two translational degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not difficult to associate the rotational degree of freedom of @xmath2 to the helicity of the massless particle .",

    "the question then is whether the present author is qualified to write about this issue .",
    "thus , it is appropriate to explain how and why he had to study wigner s paper .",
    "a more interesting story is how much resistance he had to face in making his results known to wigner and to the world .",
    "if we use the four - vector convention @xmath8 , the generators of rotations around and boosts along the @xmath1 axis take the form @xmath9 respectively .",

    "these six generators satisfy the following set of commutation relations .",
    "@xmath16 = i\\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } , \\qquad \\left[j_{i } , k_{j}\\right ] = i\\epsilon_{ijk } k_{k } , \\qquad \\left[k_{i } , k_{j}\\right ] = -i\\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k}.\\ ] ] this closed set of commutation relations is called the lie algebra of the lorentz group .",
    "the three @xmath17 operators constitute a closed subset of this lie algebra .",
    "thus , the rotation group is a subgroup of the lorentz group .",
    "in addition , wigner in 1939 considered a subgroup generated by  @xcite @xmath18 these generators satisfy the closed set of commutation relations @xmath19 = 0 , \\qquad \\left[j_{3 } , n_{1}\\right ] = in_{2 } , \\qquad \\left[j_{3 } , n_{2}\\right ] = -in_{1}.\\ ] ]     group and the cylindrical group .",
    "they share the same lie algebra , but only the cylindrical group leads to a geometrical interpretation of the gauge transformation . ]    as wigner observed in 1939  @xcite , this set of commutation relations is just like that for the generators of the two - dimensional euclidean group with one rotation and two translation generators , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cylin ] . however , the question is what aspect of the massless particle can be explained in terms of this two - dimensional geometry .",
    "indeed , this question has a stormy history , and was not answered until 1987 . in their paper of 1987  @xcite ,",
    "kim and wigner considered the surface of a circular cylinder as shown in fig .",
    "[ cylin ] . for this cylinder , rotations are possible around the @xmath1 axis .",
    "it is also possible to make translations along the @xmath1 axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ cylin ] .",
    "we can write these generators as @xmath20 applicable to the three - dimensional space of @xmath21 they then satisfy the closed set of commutation relations @xmath22 = 0 , \\qquad \\left[l_{3 } , q_{1}\\right ] = iq_{2 } , \\qquad \\left[l_{3 } , q_{2}\\right ] = -iq_{1}.\\ ] ] which becomes that of eq.([eq200 ] ) when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are replaced by @xmath25 and @xmath26 of eq.([eq005 ] ) respectively . indeed , this cylindrical group is locally isomorphic to wigner s little group for massless particles .",
    "let us go back to the generators of eq.([eq005 ] ) .",
    "the role of @xmath26 is well known .",
    "it is generates rotations around the momentum and corresponds to the helicity of the massless particle .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 matrices take the form  @xcite @xmath29 the transformation matrix is @xmath30 in his 1939 paper  @xcite , wigner observed that this matrix leaves the four - momentum of the massless particle invariant as can be seen from @xmath31 but he never attempted to apply this matrix to the photon four - potential .",
    "it is interesting to note that in 1976 noted that this form in applicable to the four - potential while making rotation and boosts whose combined effects do not change the four four - momentum  @xcite of the photon . in 1981 ,",
    "han and kim carried out the same calculation within the framework of wigner s little group  @xcite .",
    "kuperzstych s conclusion was that the four - by - four matrix of eq.([eq101 ] ) performs a gauge transformation when applied to the photon four - potential , and han and kim arrived at the same conclusion .",
    "let us see how this happens .",
    "let us next consider the electromagnetic wave propagating along the @xmath1 direction : @xmath32 and apply the @xmath33 matrix to this electromagnetic four - vector : @xmath34 which becomes @xmath35 if the four - vector satisfies the lorentz condition @xmath36 , this expression becomes @xmath37 the net effect is an addition of the same quantity to the longitudinal and time - like components while leaving the transverse components invariant .",
    "indeed , this is a gauge transformation .",
    "let us go back to the lie algebra of the lorentz group given in eq.([eq002 ] ) .",
    "it was noted that there are six four - by - four matrices satisfying nine commutation relations .",
    "it is possible to construct the same lie algebra with six two - by - two matrices  @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the pauli spin matrices . while @xmath17 are hermitian",
    ", @xmath40 are not .",
    "they are anti - hermitian .",
    "since the lie algebra of eq.([eq002 ] ) is hermitian invariant , we can construct the same lie algebra with @xmath41 this is the reason why the four - by - four dirac matrices can explain both the spin-1/2 particle and the anti - particle .",
    "thus the most general form of the transformation matrix takes the form @xmath42 and this transformation matrix is applicable to the spinors @xmath43 in addition , we have to consider the transformation matrices @xmath44 applicable to @xmath45    with this understanding , let us go back to the lie algebra of eq.([eq002 ] ) . here again the rotation generators satisfy the closed set of commutation relations : @xmath46 = i\\epsilon_{ijk } j_{k } ,   \\qquad \\left[\\dot{j}_{i } , \\dot{j}_{j}\\right ] = i\\epsilon_{ijk } \\dot{j}_{k } .\\ ] ] these operators generate the rotation - like @xmath47 group , whose physical interpretation is well known , namely the electron and positron spins .    here also we can consider the @xmath2-like subgroup generated by @xmath48 the @xmath27 and @xmath28 matrices take the form @xmath49    on the other hand , in the `` dotted '' representation , @xmath50 there are therefore two different @xmath51 matrices : @xmath52 and @xmath53 these are the gauge transformation matrices applicable to massless spin-1/2 particles  @xcite",
    ".    here are talking about the dirac equation for with four - component spinors .",
    "the spinors @xmath54 and @xmath55 are gauge - invariant since @xmath56 as for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 & { } & \\dot{d}(u , v ) \\dot{\\chi}_{+ } = \\dot{\\chi}_{+ } + ( u + iv)\\dot{\\chi}_{- } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they are not invariant under the @xmath51 transformations , and they are not gauge - invariant .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the polarization of massless neutrinos is a consequence of gauge invariance , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ neupol ] .",
    "we are familiar with the way in which the spin-1 vector is constructed from the spinors in non - relativistic world .",
    "we are now interested in constructing four - vectors from these spinors .",
    "first of all , with four of the spinors given above , we can start with the products .",
    "@xmath60 resulting in spin-0 scalars and four - vectors and four - by - four tensors for the spin-1 states  @xcite .",
    "the four - vector can be constructed from the combinations @xmath61 and @xmath62    among them , let us consider the combinations , let us consider the four resulting from @xmath63",
    ". among them , as far as the rotation subgroup is concerned , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are like @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , and and invariant under lorentz boosts along the @xmath1 direction .",
    "in addition , we should consider @xmath68 which are invariant under rotations around the @xmath1 axis .",
    "when the system boosted along the @xmath1 direction , these combinations are transformed like @xmath1 and @xmath69 directions respectively .    with these aspects in mind ,",
    "let us consider the matrix @xmath70 and write the transformation matrix @xmath71 of eq.([eq705])as @xmath72 if four matrix elements are complex numbers , there are eight independent parameters .",
    "however , the condition @xmath73 reduces this number to six .",
    "the lorentz group starts with six degrees of freedom .",
    "it is then possible to write the four - vector @xmath74 as @xmath75 with its lorentz - transformation property @xmath76 the four - momentum can also be written as @xmath77 with the the transformation property same as that for @xmath78 given in eq.([eq717 ] ) .    with this understanding , we can write the photon four - potential as @xmath79 let us go back the two - by - two matrices @xmath80 and @xmath81 given in eqs.([d201 ] ) and ( [ d202 ] ) .",
    "we said there that they perform gauge transformations on massless neutrinos .",
    "it is indeed gratifying to note that they also lead to the gauge transformation applicable to the photon four - potential .",
    "@xmath82    this results in @xmath83 if we apply the lorentz condition @xmath84 , this matrix becomes @xmath85 this result is the same as the gauge transformation in the four - by - four representation given in eq.([eq150 ] ) .",
    "in his 1939 paper  @xcite , wigner discussed his little groups for massive and massless particles as two distinct mathematical devices .",
    "indeed , inn and wigner in 1953 initiated of the unification of these little groups by observing considering a flat plane tangent to a sphere , while the plane and sphere correspond to the @xmath2 and @xmath0 symmetries respectively  @xcite .",
    "this unification was completed in 1990  @xcite .",
    "the issue is whether the @xmath2-like little group can be obtained as a zero - mass limit of the @xmath0-like little group for massive particles .",
    "another version of this limiting process is given in sec .",
    "[ o3e2 ] of the present report .    as for the internal space - time symmetry of particles ,",
    "let us go beck to bohr and einstein .",
    "bohr was interested in the electron orbit of the hydrogen atom while einstein was worrying about how things look to moving observers .",
    "they met occasionally before and after 1927 to discuss physics .",
    "did they talk about how the stationary hydrogen atom would look to a moving observer ?",
    "it they did , we do not know about it .",
    "this problem is not unlike the case of newtona law of gravity .",
    "newton worked out the inverse square law for two point particles .",
    "it took him 20 years to work out the same law for extended objects such and the sun and earth , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ newton ] .    in 1905 , einstein formulated his special relativity for point particles .",
    "it is for us to settle the issue of how the electron orbit of the hydrogen atom looks to moving observers .",
    "indeed , the circle and ellipse as given in fig .  [ newton ] have been used to illustrate this this relativistic effect .",
    "however , these figures do not take into account the fact that the electron orbit had been replaced by a standing wave .",
    "indeed , we should learn how to lorentz - boost standing waves .    yes , we know how to construct standing waves for the hydrogen atom .",
    "do we know how to lorentz - boost this atom ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "however , we can replace it with the proton without changing quantum mechanics . both the hydrogen atom and the proton are quantum bound states , but",
    "the proton can be accelerated . while the coulomb force is applicable to the hydrogen , the harmonic oscillator potential is used as the simplest binding force for the quark model  @xcite .",
    "we can switch the coulomb wave functions with oscillator wave functions without changing quantum mechanics .",
    "this problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ quapar ] .",
    "then it is possible to construct the oscillator wave functions as a representation of wigner s little group  @xcite . in this two - by - two representation , the lorentz boost along the positive direction is @xmath86 the rotation around the @xmath13 axis is @xmath87 then , the boosted rotation matrix is @xmath88    if @xmath89 becomes very large , and this matrix is to remain finite , @xmath90 has to become very small , and this expression becomes  @xcite @xmath91 with @xmath92 this expression becomes @xmath93 in this two - by - two representation , the rotation around the @xmath1 axis is @xmath94 respectively .",
    "thus @xmath95 which becomes @xmath96 with @xmath97    here , we have studied how the little group for the @xmath0-like little group the massive particle becomes the @xmath2-like little group for the massless particle in the infinite-@xmath89 limit .",

    "the parameter @xmath89 can be derived from the speed of of the particle .",

    "let us carry our the same limiting process for the four - by - four representation . from the generators of the lorentz group , it is possible to construct the four - by - four matrices for rotations around the @xmath13 axis and lorentz boosts along the @xmath1 axis as  @xcite @xmath105 respectively .",

    "dieter brill contributed this photo .",
    "weinberg was sam treiman s first phd student and got his degree in 1957 .",
    "since i went to princeton in 1958 , i did not have overlapping years with weinberg , but i had to read his thesis to copy his style of writing .",
    "i still like his english style .",
    "of course , i am proud of working with wigner during his late years . on the other and , could i do this job without my own background ?",
    "i had to fix up wigner s work in order to put my own physics program on a solid theoretical ground . when i was graduate student , and for several years after my phd degree , i lived in the world where the origin of physics is believed to be in the complex plane of the s - matrix , and bound states should be described by poles in the complex plane .",
    "in 1965 , when i pointed out those poles do not necessarily lead to localized wave functions  @xcite , i had to face a stiff resistance from the influential members of the american physics community .",
    "i choose not to mention their names .",
    "they told me wave functions have nothing to do with physics .",
    "this is a totally destructive attitude .",
    "however , i took their reactions constructively .",
    "we do not know how to lorentz - boost bound - state wave functions , while the s - matrix is a product of the lorentz - covariant field theory .",
    "cccc & & & +   + & & & + & massive , slow & covariance & massless , fast + & & & + energy- & & einstein s & + momentum & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath5 + & & + internal & @xmath6 & & @xmath6 + space - time & & wigner s & + symmetry & @xmath7 & little group & gauge transformations + & & + & & + moving & gell - mann s & covariant & feynman s + h - atom & quark model & bound state & parton model + & & +   +    thus , my problem was to find at least one wave function that can be lorentz - boosted .",
    "i then realized that dirac in 1945  @xcite and yukawa in 1953  @xcite constructed a gaussian form that can be lorentz - boosted .",
    "in april of 1970 , at the spring meeting of the american physical society , feynman gave a talk where he repeatedly mentioned wave functions .",
    "he was talking about hadrons as bound states of quarks .",
    "my colleagues were saying feynman was absolutely crazy , but he was a savior to me .",
    "let us face the difficulty of boosting wave functions . in 1971",
    "@xcite , with his students , feynman published a paper based on his 1970 talk  @xcite .",
    "there , they start with a lorentz - invariant differential equation for particles bound together by harmonic - oscillator potential . however , they produce solutions containing the gaussian form @xmath118 this form is invariant under lorentz transformations , but it is not possible to physical interpretations to @xmath69 variable .    on the other hand , feynman s differential equation also produces the solutions containing thee gaussian form @xmath119 in this case , the wave function is normalizable in all the variables .",
    "the form is not invariant .",
    "this means the wave function appears differently to moving observers .",
    "figure  [ quapar ] illustrates how differently the wave function look differently .    with marilyn",
    "noz , i used the gaussian form of eq.([cov11 ] ) to show that gell - mann s quark model and feynman s parton model are two different limits of one lorentz - covariant entity , and submitted our result to physical review letters .",
    "the referee was very competent and honest .",
    "he / she said he / she really learned what the parton model is all about and the result is important .",
    "however , he would `` enthusiastically '' recommend publication in the comments and addenda section of the phys .",
    "d , instead of prl . we accepted his / her recommendation and published paper as a comment  @xcite .",
    "however , what aspect of the fundamental symmetry does this quark - parton reflect ? in order to answer this question , i had to study wigner s 1939 paper , and show that the lorentz - covariant oscillator wave functions are representations of wigner s @xmath0-like little group  @xcite .",
    "my continued efforts led to a prl paper of 1989  @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "i expanded table  [ gen11 ] to table  [ gen22 ] .",
    "this paper also contains the major portion of fig .",
    "[ quapar ] . the elliptic squeeze described in this fiigure",
    "is called the space - time entanglement in the current literature  @xcite .",
    "let me summarize what i said above .",
    "many people told me i am totally isolated from the rest of the physics world while working on the problem nobody else worries about .",
    "i disagree .",

    "<S> in 1963 , eugene paul wigner was awarded the nobel prize in physics for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles , particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles . </S>",
    "<S> there are no disputes about this statement . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there still is a question of why the statement did not mention wigner s 1939 paper on the lorentz group , which was regarded by wigner and many others as his most important contribution in physics . by many physicists , </S>",
    "<S> this paper was regarded as a mathematical exposition having nothing to do with physics . however , it has been more than one half century since 1963 , and it is of interest to see what progress has been made toward understanding physical implications of this paper and its historical role in physics . </S>",
    "<S> wigner in his 1963 paper defined the subgroups of the lorentz group whose transformations do not change the four - momentum of a given particle , and he called them the little groups . </S>",
    "<S> thus , wigner s little groups are for internal space - time symmetries of particles in the lorentz - covariant world . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this subgroup can explain the electron spin and spins of other massive particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , for massless particles , there was a gap between his little group and electromagnetic waves derivable maxwell s equations . </S>",
    "<S> this gap was not completely removed until 1990 . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this report is to review the stormy historical process in which this gap is cleared . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that wigner s little groups indeed can be combined into one lorentz - covariant formula which can dictate the symmetry of the internal space - time time symmetries of massive and massless particles in the lorentz covariant world , just like einstein s energy - momentum relation applicable to both slow and massless particles .    </S>",
