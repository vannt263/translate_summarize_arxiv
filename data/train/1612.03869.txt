    "quantum entanglement is the cornerstone of novel quantum technologies , particularly quantum computing and communication .",
    "the enormous interest in quantum communication is driven by its built - in security which protects the transmission of information and quantum entanglement for applications such as distributed quantum computing , quantum key distribution and quantum internet .",
    "to create distributed entanglement between two separated locations ( nodes ) , qubits at each node must be entangled to flying qubits which are then sent to a common location to undergo joint measurements that implement entanglement swapping.@xcite to achieve entanglement between nodes at large distances , beyond the capabilities of optical fibers , the entanglement must be refreshed in intermediate nodes known as quantum repeaters.@xcite the standard paradigm for a quantum repeater was until recently based on atomic quantum memories located at primary nodes , each entangled with a single photon,@xcite which in turn is sent to a secondary , intermediate node.@xcite two photons arriving at a secondary node undergo a bell measurement , a process that transforms the qubit - photon entanglement into long - distance two - qubit entanglement where the two qubits involved are located at the two different primary nodes on either side of the secondary node . difficulties associated with atomic - memory - based quantum repeaters include the necessity for long coherence times of the atomic memory beyond what is currently feasible and also the inherent vulnerability of these schemes to photon loss .",
    "zwerger et al.@xcite introduced the idea of using highly entangled states , known as graph states,@xcite to implement quantum repeaters . in a recent publication ,",
    "azuma et al.@xcite put forward an explicit construction of an all - photonic repeater graph state ( rgs ) consisting of a completely connected graph of ` core ' photons , with each of them featuring a connection to an additional ` arm ' photon , to be used for entanglement swapping in the secondary nodes .",
    "this work has attracted a great deal of attention * ? ? ?",
    "* due to its advantages over atomic - memory based repeaters , notably the all - photonic construction that avoids coherence time limitations , the resilience against photon loss , and the elimination of long - distance heralding.@xcite these attractive features position quantum repeaters , and consequently long - distance quantum communication , as near - term , much more readily feasible technology compared to quantum computing.@xcite    despite the promise held by the all - photonic rgss of ref .",
    ", construction of multiphotonic entanglement is extremely challenging .",
    "this is due to the fact that photons do not interact with each other , so that either a nonlinear interaction or measurement are required to entangle two photons that are initially in a product state .",
    "both approaches are challenging because non - linear interactions are very weak and measurements are probabilistic . the standard process of generating graph states ( or cluster states@xcite for quantum computing)@xcite begins with pairs of photons that are prepared in entangled ( bell ) states through parametric down - conversion .",
    "two different pairs are then  fused \" together probabilistically via the joint measurement of two photons , one from each pair . when the measurement succeeds , which happens with probability @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 if ancillary qubits are used ) , a three - photon graph state is obtained .",
    "such fusion gates are used consecutively to ` grow ' the graph state.@xcite to date , up to ten photons have been entangled in this way.@xcite the analysis of quantifying the resource overhead of rgss was carried out@xcite and , even after an optimization of the original scheme of ref .  , @xmath2 photon sources per node are needed .",
    "overcoming the probabilistic nature of rgs generation would therefore be catalytic in drastically reducing overhead . here",
    ", we show that repeater graph states of arbitrarily large size can be created deterministically by using quantum emitters with appropriate level structures and selection rules .",
    "the overhead of our approach is dramatically reduced compared to fusion - based approaches .",
    "our remarkable finding is that the number of emitters required does not scale with the size of the repeater state : surprisingly , two emitters suffice to generate an rgs of arbitrary size .",
    "a deterministic approach to the creation of linear cluster states was introduced several years ago,@xcite and later generalized to a cluster state ladder.@xcite the first experimental demonstration of deterministic linear cluster state generation was carried out recently following these ideas.@xcite the number of emitters needed to create larger two - dimensional cluster states is equal to the linear size of the state , making the creation of a large square grid cluster state conditional on future advances in controllably coupling a long chain of emitters .",
    "nevertheless , the concepts introduced in refs .   for one and two emitters",
    "are central to our present work .",
    "we follow these works in assuming an emitter that has the level structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevels](a ) .",
    "we also consider that two adjacent emitters can be coupled such that entanglement can be created between them .",
    "repeater state .",
    "all but 2 of the 8 entangled photons comprising this repeater state can be produced from a single emitter.,width=13 ]",
    "lindner and rudolph@xcite proposed a method in which a quantum dot or similar system with the level structure displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevels](a ) could be optically pumped to generate photons that are entangled with the electron spin .",
    "moreover , they showed that repeated pumping of such an emitter can produce a chain of photons which can be entangled with the emitter and with each other .",
    "in particular , if the pumping is performed repeatedly without applying any other operations on the emitter , then a photonic ghz state will be created in which every photon is entangled with the emitter and with every other photon . on the other hand ,",
    "if a hadamard gate is applied on the emitter between each pumping operation , then the resulting state is instead a one - dimensional linear cluster state in which each photon is entangled with the photon that preceded it and with the one that follows it .",
    "[ fig : energylevels](b ) shows the graph corresponding to this linear photonic cluster state . in this figure , each circle represents a qubit ( blue circles are photons , and the red circle is the emitter ) , and the lines between them represent pairwise entanglement.@xcite specifically , the state represented by a connected graph can be created by initializing all qubits to the state @xmath3 and successively performing cz gates between all pairs of qubits connected by an edge of the graph .",
    "ref .   presented a family of repeater states , where each member of the family is characterized by the number @xmath4 of external arms in the corresponding graph .",
    "for example , the graph that consists of the blue ( photon ) vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig : generation](c ) represents the @xmath5 repeater state . in the scheme of ref .",
    ", one such state is generated at each primary node of the repeater network , and entanglement swapping between primary nodes is performed by sending half of the @xmath4 external photons to an adjacent secondary node , where they encounter an additional @xmath6 photons that were sent out from the repeater state at the next primary node .",
    "entanglement between the primary nodes is then created by performing bell measurements on pairs of photons that arrived from different primary nodes .",
    "the redundancy of sending @xmath6 photons rather than one reduces the sensitivity of this procedure to errors , so that more robust repeater networks are realized as @xmath4 is increased .    using only the pumping technique developed in ref .  , but carefully choosing when to apply hadamard gates , large portions of photonic repeater states can be generated using only a single emitter .",
    "in particular , the complete subgraph of fully interconnected photons in the center of the rgs [ see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : generation](c ) ] as well as two of the external photon arms can be generated in this way using only one emitter .",
    "for example , the portion of the @xmath7 rgs that can be created is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevels](c ) .",
    "this state can be generated by performing the following sequence of operations on the emitter : @xmath8 , followed by single - qubit @xmath9 and @xmath10 gates on the four central photons . in this sequence",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the ground state of the emitter , @xmath12 is a hadamard gate , @xmath13 is the pumping operation , and @xmath14 is a final @xmath15-measurement performed on the emitter in order to decouple it from the chain of emitted photons .",
    "one option for completing the rgs is to attach the remaining photon arms via probabilistic fusion gates.@xcite in the @xmath7 rgs example , 6 of the 8 entangled photons ( more generally @xmath16 of the @xmath17 photons ) are produced using a single photon source . constructing this state by fusing together three - photon ghz states without",
    "the use of a photonic emitter would require 5 successful fusion gate applications ( in general @xmath18 fusion gates are needed ) .",
    "thus , we see that the utilization of a photonic emitter significantly decreases the necessary number of probabilistic fusion gates and the number of photon sources needed at each node , greatly reducing the overhead compared to what is needed to generate the entire state via fusion .",
    "we now show that an additional dramatic reduction in the overhead can be achieved by introducing a second emitter .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that arbitrarily large repeater graph states can be completely generated using only two coupled emitters .",
    "inclusion of the second emitter greatly increases the flexibility one has in creating graph states .",
    "this is because entanglement between the two emitters causes the emitted photons from each to be entangled , and it enables a photon that is initially entangled with only one emitter to become entangled with the second emitter and to other photons that are entangled with the first emitter [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : generation](a ) ] .",
    "our scheme for deterministically generating rgss combines these features of photon emission from entangled emitters with the fact that rgss are closely related to tree - like cluster states.@xcite in particular , the fully interconnected web of photons at the center of an rgs can be obtained by performing an operation known as local complementation@xcite around the central `` root '' vertex of a tree , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generation](c ) .",
    "local complementation can be implemented by applying the single - qubit gate @xmath19 to the root vertex and the gate @xmath20 to each of the neighboring vertices .",
    "single - qubit photonic gates are much easier to implement than gates on the emitters ; thus , the generation of tree states can easily be extended to repeater states via local complementation .",
    "[ fig : generation ] summarizes our scheme for deterministically generating the all - photonic repeater states introduced in ref .  .",
    "our procedure for generating the underlying tree states involves using a single emitter ( labeled @xmath21 ) at the root as an  anchor \" , and then using a second emitter to generate each branch of the tree , one at a time . for each branch",
    ", the second emitter ( labeled @xmath22 ) is connected to the root vertex by applying a cz gate between the two emitters .",
    "the second emitter is then pumped twice as shown in the top parts of figs .",
    "[ fig : generation](a),(b ) , hadamard gates are applied to one of the photons and the emitter , and finally a @xmath15-measurement is performed on the emitter .",
    "this has the effect of severing the second emitter from the graph , leaving the other two photons attached to the first emitter in a chain as shown in the bottom parts of figs .",
    "[ fig : generation](a),(b ) .",
    "the second emitter can then be reinitialized , and the whole process can be repeated in order to generate an arbitrary number of branches in the tree cluster state .",
    "the full sequence of gates needed to create an rgs with an arbitrary number of external arms @xmath4 ( corresponding to an rgs of degree @xmath6 ) is given in the methods section .",
    "the most challenging part of the sequence are the two - emitter entangling cz gates . in the methods section ,",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : generation ] , where emitter @xmath22 produces all of the photons , while emitter @xmath21 never emits even a single photon . the role of emitter @xmath21 is to hold the different arms of the tree together while @xmath22 generates new arms and attaches them to @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that all photons are emitted from a single emitter makes it far simpler to ensure that the photons comprising the rgs are indistinguishable , as is necessary for the functionality of repeater networks .",
    "photon indistinguishability will not be compromised if the two emitters are not perfectly identical as is often the case , especially with solid state emitters such as quantum dots .",
    "it is of course still necessary to achieve uniformity between emitters on different nodes of the network .",
    "this will be considered further in the discussion section below .     with @xmath24 branches .",
    "black edges represent entanglement created by pumping an emitter , while red edges represent entanglement created with a cz gate between two emitters.,width=8 ]    our method can be generalized to deterministically create arbitrary tree states .",
    "more general tree states are important because they can be combined with graph states such as the rgs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generation](c ) to create a similar state that is robust against photon losses.@xcite to create a general tree state , one emitter is needed for each level of the tree except for the bottommost one . in our proposed scheme , the first emitter is again used at the root as an `` anchor '' , and the second emitter",
    "is used to generate each branch using cz gates as above . for each subtree , the second emitter",

    "in addition , the only multi - qubit gates required are the cz gates between the two emitters .",
    "large trees can be generated with the requisite number of emitters scaling as the depth of the tree , thus logarithmically in the total number of qubits .",
    "we quantify the practicality of our scheme by finding the fidelity of the rgs as a function of the individual gate fidelities of the gates used in the rgs generation sequence . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid1 ] we assume that the fidelities of single photonic gates and optical pumping are much higher than the fidelities of single unitary gates and cz gates on the emitters , and thus the fidelity of the final states are essentially determined by the latter two .",

    "[ fig : generation](c ) , where it is evident that this state can be created with greater than 90% fidelity if cz gate fidelities are above 99% and single - qubit gate fidelities exceed 99.8% . in the case of the error - correcting repeater state shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bbnstate ] , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : fid1](b ) that reaching 90% fidelity requires cz gate fidelities around 99.8% and single - qubit gate fidelities around 99.95% .",
    "there are several criteria in identifying systems to implement our scheme for deterministic all - photonic repeater state generation .",
    "first , the emitters must have the requisite level structure and selection rules , namely they must have two degenerate ground states , each of which is coupled to one corresponding excited state as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevels](a ) .",
    "note that for the repeater states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generation]c and in fig .",
    "[ fig : withtrees ] , only one of the two emitters needs to satisfy this condition .",
    "the second criterion is that emitters should be coupled to each other to enable the entangling cz gates .",
    "third , the emitted photons must be indistinguishable , both at different nodes and at the same node , over the time it takes to generate and entangle repeater states .",
    "fourth , the extraction efficiency of the photons from the emitter should be high .",
    "fifth , the setup should be able to incorporate coupling to fibers in order to transmit the photons to the remote nodes with high fidelity . finally , it is desirable to have high yield , meaning that the photons are generated at high rates .",
    "self - assembled quantum dots coupled to cavities satisfy all of these criteria . their broken symmetry along the growth axis provides the desired level structure and selection rules , and pairs of quantum dots can be grown in a stacked configuration allowing for coupling between the two electron spins trapped in each dot via the exchange interaction .",
    "this interaction is the enabling mechanism for the inter - emitter cz gate .",
    "in fact , the early works for 1d@xcite and 2d@xcite cluster state generation were based on quantum dots . in a recent breakthrough experiment ,",
    "schwartz et al.@xcite generated deterministically a cluster state string of five entangled photons using a confined dark exciton in a quantum dot .",
    "this work constituted a proof - of - principle demonstration that does not yet include optimization over the various metrics ( photon generation rate , efficiency , etc ) .",
    "over the last few years there has been great interest and rapid progress in single - photon devices based on quantum dots which can be harnessed for the repeater generation device we are proposing .",
    "one challenge traditionally associated with quantum dots is their spectral inhomogeneity , a severe issue for indistinguishability .",
    "our scheme for bare repeater states avoids this difficulty since all photons are produced by a single emitter .",
    "however , it remains a challenge for the dressed repeater state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbnstate ] , where photons are produced by two different emitters , and for photons in different repeater states generated at different nodes .",
    "several years ago , it was demonstrated that quantum dots can be tuned over a large spectral range , which allowed for photon interference coming from remote qds,@xcite and very recently it was shown that such tuning can be successfully implemented in a qd - micropillar device,@xcite demonstrating indistinguishability of photons over more than 10 microseconds.@xcite another challenge that was recently overcome is the difficulty of photon extraction . within the last year , several groups have shown photon extraction rates ranging from 66%@xcite to more than 98%,@xcite and very recently the chip - to - fiber coupling efficiency was shown to exceed 80%.@xcite efforts to engineer these systems to even higher metrics are ongoing , and we anticipate near - ideal metrics over the next couple of years",
    ".    other types of emitters aside from quantum dots can also be used , with recent work@xcite showing that several defect centers , including the nv center in diamond and in silicon carbide ( sic ) , as well as vacancy and divacancy defects in sic , have the required level structure .",
    "similar challenges as in quantum dots are being addressed for these systems , namely the broad photon emission , coupling to cavities and photon extraction",
    ". there has been significant experimental progress recently in terms of emitter indistinguishability,@xcite photon extraction efficiency,@xcite and coupling to fibers.@xcite purcell enhancements amounting to a 70-fold increase of emission into the zero phonon line have been achieved in nv centers in diamond,@xcite and protocols for suppressing spectral diffusion have been put forward.@xcite very recent developments with photonic crystal cavities in sic have demonstrated an 80-fold enhancement of selective photon emission into the desired zero phonon line , i.e. , without enhancing the spectrally closest transition.@xcite on the other hand , the mechanism for the inter - emitter entangling cz gate is not as clear as in the case of qds , where dots can be stacked during growth .",
    "recent experiments , however , have made progress toward controllable defect positioning;@xcite this result can pave the way toward the design and demonstration of an entangling gate between nearest neighbor defects . in the case of a rgs that can be generated from pumping only one emitter , the second qubit could be a different system , such as a nuclear spin.@xcite other solid - state systems that show promise are defects or quantum dots in 2d materials , including hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides , where single photon emitters have been seen.@xcite the 2d nature of these materials allows for high photon extraction rates , and coupling to photonic crystal cavities has already been demonstrated.@xcite    with all the recent experimental developments , proof of principle demonstrations of our protocols for deterministic repeater graph states can be carried out using existing technology .",

    "such a correction would also be necessary if the second emitter is not reinitialized to @xmath11 between measurement and reentanglement with the rest of the graph state .",

    "<S> quantum repeaters are nodes in a quantum communication network that allow reliable transmission of entanglement over large distances . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently shown that highly entangled photons in so - called graph states can be used for all - photonic quantum repeaters , which require substantially fewer resources compared to atomic - memory based repeaters </S>",
    "<S> . however , standard approaches to building multi - photon entangled states through pairwise probabilistic entanglement generation severely limit the size of the state that can be created . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a protocol for the deterministic generation of large photonic repeater states using quantum emitters such as semiconductor quantum dots and defect centers in solids . we show that arbitrarily large repeater states can be generated using only two coupled emitters , reducing the necessary number of photon sources by six orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol includes a built - in redundancy which makes it resilient to photon loss .    </S>",
