    "the proofs of the statements in the paper are technical . to enhance the readability of the paper , the paper is essentially split into two parts .",
    "the first part contains all the statements and can be read independently from the second part containing the proofs .",
    "moreover , section [ sec : bhsresults ] is independent of the remainder of the paper , and in section [ sec : bhsresults ] we state explicit results for special functions of basic hypergeometric type .",
    "this section is meant for people interested in special functions . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we have added an index , which includes references to notations frequently used .",
    "on the one hand , the general theory of quantum groups has its roots in approaches in the axiomatizations of generalizations of groups such that the pontryagin - van kampen duality for locally compact abelian groups extends to this wider class .",
    "on the other hand , a large class of explicit and interesting quantum groups arose from various cases , e.g. @xmath3-matrices as solutions of the yang - baxter equation and the rtf - formalism .",
    "for the quantum groups related to compact groups arising in this way the duality is formulated on the level of hopf algebra duality between the quantized function algebra and the quantized enveloping algebra .",
    "for the historic development of the general theory for locally compact quantum groups we refer to the papers especially the introductions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and books @xcite , @xcite . for the development of quantum groups involving the yang - baxter equation and the rtf - formalism we refer to the books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that many of the examples arising in this way fit into the general theory of quantum groups , especially for the quantum group analogues of compact groups .",
    "these quantum groups can usually be analyzed in an algebraic way .",
    "for quantum group analogues of non - compact groups the situation is not so clear .",
    "as it turns out the hopf algebra arising from the standard @xmath3-matrix for @xmath1 has three different @xmath4-structures @xcite , and we consider a @xmath4-structure making the hopf algebra into a hopf @xmath4-algebra as the choice of an appropriate real form . the compact case ,",
    "corresponding to the quantum group analogue of @xmath5 , has been studied extensively , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references given there .",
    "this is also the basic example of a quantum group having an intimate link with special functions of basic hypergeometric type @xcite , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as well as @xcite .",
    "then there is the non - compact case associated to the non - compact group @xmath0 and a non - compact case associated to the group @xmath6 .",
    "although @xmath7 as lie groups the corresponding hopf @xmath4-algebras for the deformed case are different .",
    "the subject of this paper is the hopf @xmath4-algebra associated to the group @xmath0 , in which the deformation parameter @xmath8 is real . for the case of the hopf @xmath4-algebra associated to @xmath6",
    "the deformation parameter is on the unit circle , and the situation changes dramatically , see @xcite and for recent progress on the level of associated special functions see van de bult @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the hopf @xmath4-algebra associated to @xmath0 , which is recalled in section [ sec : quantumsu11description ] .",
    "we also recall that woronowicz @xcite showed that there was no way to extend the comultiplication of this hopf @xmath4-algebra in analytic way , i.e. to the level of operators on hilbert spaces . based on work of korogodsky @xcite and woronowicz @xcite it is possible to show that there exists a quantum group analogue of the normalizer of @xmath0 in @xmath1 in the context of the definition of kustermans and vaes @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for an introduction ) on the level of a von neumann algebraic quantum group .",
    "this has been shown in @xcite , where special functions of basic hypergeometric type proved to be essential in the construction .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an explicit description of the dual quantum group and to decompose the left regular corepresentation into irreducible corepresentations for this explicit quantum group . in the decomposition of the left regular corepresentation",
    "we see the analogy with the group case , since in the left regular representation of the group @xmath7 only discrete series representations and principal unitary series occur .",
    "however , in the quantum group case the discrete series are no longer split up into a positive discrete series and a negative discrete series .",
    "some of these results have been announced in @xcite , and in this paper we give full proofs of these statements .",
    "this paper can be read independently from @xcite . after browsing the paper",
    "it should be clear to the casual reader that making the general quantum group machinery work for this specific case is a very technical business .",
    "however , we believe that this is worthwhile since @xmath7 is one of the most important non - compact lie groups @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and any reasonable quantum group theory has to have the example of a quantum group analogue of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we hope that understanding this example may also lead to other non - trivial examples of non - compact quantum groups and related quantum homogeneous spaces , such as quantum group analogues of @xmath9 , and related homogeneous spaces @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , in the operator algebra context @xmath11-theory is available , and the first step in this direction is taken @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can ask for a @xmath11-theoretic approach to discrete series representations in this setting .",
    "we expect that the link with special functions can lead to new and deep results in the theory of special functions , and we have included some highly non - trivial examples in section [ sec : bhsresults ] , but we expect that the relation is deeper and not yet fully exploited .",
    "e.g. the link with twisted primitive elements , suitable cartan type decompositions and ( associated ) spherical functions and corresponding transform as indicated in @xcite can be studied from an operator algebraic point of view , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for a more general study of the plancherel measure in this context . having the decomposition of the left regular representation available it is now also natural to consider other questions , e.g. can we decompose tensor products , describe the intertwiners in terms of special functions , etc ?",
    "we are confident that the interpretation of discrete series representations in this context gives a solution to indeterminacy problems related to certain tensor product decompositions of infinite dimensional representations of @xmath2 , see cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite for cases where the indeterminacy is absent .",
    "we now describe the contents of the paper . in sections [ sec :",

    "it turns out that the self - adjoint extension of the algebraically defined symmetric , but not essentially self - adjoint , operator is characterized by affiliation to the von neumann algebra for the dual quantum group .",

    "we collect some interesting new ( as far as we are aware ) results for special functions of basic hypergeometric type which are byproducts of the approach taken .",
    "in particular , the results discussed in section [ sec : bhsresults ] can be read independently by someone only interested in special functions , but the proofs are dependent on the rest of the paper .",
