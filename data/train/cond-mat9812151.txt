    "remarkable advances in thin film technology have recently led to active interest in the nature of magnetism in ultrathin films , at surfaces and multilayer structures .",
    "the influence of the reduced dimensionality on the magnetic behavior of @xmath0 transition metals has been extensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . on the experimental side",
    "it was shown that ultrathin transition metal films can display long range ferromagnetic order from a monolayer on @xcite .",
    "although the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite requires the transition temperature to vanish for perfectly isotropic two dimensional systems , it was shown theoretically that even a small amount of anisotropy may lead to magnetic order with a substantial transition temperature @xcite .",
    "in real materials magnetic anisotropy is always present by virtue of either the dipole interaction or the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath1k properties of thin transition metal films have been addressed by ab initio calculations within the density functional theory in the local density approximation @xcite . however , these approaches are strictly based on a stoner - type model of ferromagnetism and , therefore , treat electron correlation effects which are responsible for the spontaneous magnetic order on a low level . in addition",
    "they are restricted to ground state properties only . to overcome this restriction , for example ,",
    "a generalization of the fluctuating local moment method has been used @xcite to calculate the temperature - dependent electronic structure of thin ferromagnetic films .",
    "however , the layer magnetizations at finite temperatures and the magnetic short range order are needed as an input . in ref .",
    "@xcite magnetic phase transitions in thin films are investigated via a mapping of the ab initio results onto an effective ising model .",
    "hasegawa calculates the finite temperature properties of thin cu / ni / cu sandwiches by use of the single - site spin - fluctuation theory @xcite .    for the understanding of the thermodynamical properties of thin film magnetism theoretical investigations on rather idealized model systems",
    "have proven to be a good starting point . in this context",
    "several authors have focused on localized spin models like the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "for example , the mechanism that leads to the experimentally observed temperature induced reorientation of the direction of magnetization in thin fe and ni films @xcite was investigated in great detail @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is by no means clear to what extent the results obtained by localized spin models are applicable to transition metal films , where the magnetically active electrons are itinerant .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the interplay between strong electron correlations and the reduced translational symmetry due to the film geometry within an itinerant electron model system .",
    "in particular we are interested in the influence of the reduced dimensionality on spontaneous ferromagnetism and the spin- , layer- and temperature - dependent electronic structure . for this purpose",
    "we restrict ourselves , at present , to the investigation of the single - band hubbard model @xcite , which includes the minimum set of terms necessary for the description of itinerant - electron magnetism .",
    "the hubbard model was originally introduced to explain band magnetism in transition metals and has become a standard model to study the essential physics of strongly correlated electron systems over the years .",
    "it is clear that a realistic and quantitative description of ferromagnetism in transition metals requires the inclusion of the degeneracy of the 3d - bands @xcite .",
    "although the band - degeneracy is neglected in our model study , we believe that a treatment of electron correlation effects well beyond hartree - fock theory will provide important insight into generic properties of thin film ferromagnetism . for example , contrary to the expectation on the basis of the well - known stoner criterion , the magnetic order at the film surface may be reduced and less stable compared to the inner layers if electron correlations are taken into account properly @xcite .    despite its apparent simplicity no general solution exists until now for the hubbard model .",
    "however , recently exact results have been obtained by finite temperature quantum monte carlo calculations in the limit of infinite dimensions @xcite which prove the existence of ferromagnetic solutions for intermediate to strong coulomb interaction @xmath2 .",
    "in addition the decisive importance of the lattice geometry , i.e. the dispersion and distribution of spectral weight in the non - interacting ( bloch ) density of states ( bdos ) , on the magnetic stability was stressed by several authors @xcite . a reasonable treatment of electron correlation effects led to an argument for the stability of ferromagnetism which is decisively more restrictive the well known stoner criterion .",
    "a bdos with large spectral weight near one of the band edges is an essential ingredient for ferromagnetism .",
    "the thermal stability of ferromagnetic solutions is favored by a strong asymmetry in the bdos @xcite .",
    "this behavior of the bdos is found , for example , in non - bipartite lattices like the fcc lattice .    due to the broken translational symmetry even more complications",
    "are introduced to the highly non - trivial many - body problem of the hubbard model .",
    "thus we require an approximation scheme which is simple enough to allow for an extended study of magnetic phase transitions and electronic correlations in thin films . on the other hand it should be clearly beyond hartree - fock ( stoner ) theory which has been applied previously @xcite , since we believe a reasonable treatment of electron correlation effects to be vital for a proper description of ferromagnetism especially for non - zero temperatures .    in this",
    "context interpolating theories which are essentially based on exact results obtained by the @xmath3 perturbation theory first introduced by harris and lange @xcite have proven to be a good starting point @xcite . a theory that reproduces the rigorous strong coupling results in a conceptual clear and straightforward manner",
    "is given by the spectral density approach ( sda ) which has been discussed with respect to spontaneous magnetic order for various three - dimensional @xcite as well as infinite dimensional @xcite lattices .",
    "a similar approach applied to a multiband hubbard model led to surprisingly accurate results for the magnetic key quantities of the prototype band ferromagnets fe , co , and ni @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the sda to systems with reduced translational symmetry has recently been given in refs .",
    "@xcite , which led , for example , to the description of the temperature - driven reorientation transition within an itinerant - electron film @xcite .",
    "however , a severe limitation of the sda results from the fact that quasiparticle damping is neglected completely . to tackle this problem a modified alloy analogy has been proposed @xcite which is closely related to the sda but includes quasiparticle damping effects in a natural way . for bulk systems",
    "it was found that the magnetic region in the phase diagram is significantly reduced by the inclusion of damping effects . by comparison @xcite with exact results for the fcc lattice in the limit of infinite dimension and intermediate coulomb interaction",
    "it is clear that the curie temperatures are somewhat overestimated within the maa .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior of the ferromagnetic solutions and in particular the dependence of the curie temperature on the band occupation is found to be in good agreement with the exact results .    in the present work",
    "we want to apply the maa to systems with reduced translational symmetry . for this purpose",

    "the same labeling with latin and greek indices applies for all quantities related to the film geometry . within each layer",
    "we assume translational invariance . then a two - dimensional fourier transformation with respect to the bravais lattice can be applied .    using this notation",
    "the hamiltonian for the single - band hubbard film reads : @xmath10 here @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) stands for the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath13 at the lattice site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the number operator .",
    "@xmath2 denotes the on - site coulomb matrix element and @xmath16 the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath17 is the hopping integral between the lattice sites @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",

    "further we define @xmath21 which gives the center of gravity of the @xmath22-th layer in the bdos .",
    "the basic quantity to be calculated is the retarded single - electron green function @xmath23 from @xmath24 we can obtain all relevant information on the system .",
    "after a two - dimensional fourier transformation one obtains from @xmath24 the spectral density @xmath25 which represents the bare lineshape of a ( direct , inverse ) photoemission experiment .",
    "the diagonal elements of the green function determine the spin- and layer - dependent quasiparticle density of states ( qdos ) : @xmath26 via an energy integration one immediately gets from @xmath27 the band occupations @xmath28 @xmath29 denotes the grand - canonical average and @xmath30 is the fermi function .",

    "we want to define the moments of the green function @xmath40 the usefulness of the moments @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) results from the fact that an alternative but equivalent representation can be derived by use of the heisenberg representation of the creation and annihilation operators .",

    "( [ mom1 ] ) and ( [ mom2 ] ) impose rigorous sum rules on the green function and the self - energy which have been recognized to state important guidelines when constructing approximate solutions for the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "for example , the high energy expansion of the green function is directly determined by the moments @xmath41 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the sum rules are especially important in the limit of strong coulomb interaction : being consistent with the sum rules up to the order @xmath45 states a necessary condition in order to reproduce the exact results of the @xmath3-perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "[ sec_maa ] for the construction of a modified alloy analogy ( maa ) to the hubbard film .",
    "first we want to introduce the concept of the alloy analogy approach for systems with reduced translational symmetry .",
    "the main idea of the conventional alloy analogy approach @xcite is to consider , for the moment , the @xmath46-electrons to be `` frozen '' and to be randomly distributed over the sites of the lattice .",
    "then a propagating @xmath13-electron encounters a situation which is equivalent to a fictitious alloy : at empty lattice sites it finds the atomic energy @xmath47 , at sites with a @xmath46-electron present the atomic energy @xmath48 .",
    "these energy levels are randomly distributed over the lattice with concentrations @xmath49 and @xmath50 which correspond to the probabilities for the @xmath13-electron to meet these respective situations .",
    "note that at this point it is not at all clear what choice of the energy levels and concentrations gives the best approximation for the initial hamiltonian .",
    "however , an `` optimal '' choice of the alloy analogy parameters should by some means account for the itineracy of the @xmath46-electrons ( see sect .",
    "[ sec_maa ] ) . in the present film system",
    "the energy levels and concentrations may , in addition , exhibit a layer - dependence .",
    "thus the alloy analogy for the hubbard film is described by @xmath51 a priori unknown parameters @xmath52    for the solution of the fictitious alloy problem given by ( [ ap ] ) the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite provides a well known method .",
    "the cpa has been realized to be the rigorous solution of the alloy problem in the limit of infinite dimensions @xcite where the single - site aspect used in the derivation of the cpa becomes exact . in this sense",
    "the cpa can be termed to be the best single - site approximation to the alloy problem . due to the single - site aspect and the assumed translational invariance within the layers we have @xmath53 . the implicit cpa equation @xcite for the self - energy is readily formulated via an effective medium approach similar to the one discussed in ref .",

    "( [ cpa ] ) and ( [ local_g ] ) have to be solved selfconsistently to obtain @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "up to now nothing has been said about the actual choice of the atomic energies @xmath58 and the corresponding concentrations @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) . in the conventional alloy analogy ( aa )",
    "@xcite the alloy parameters ( [ ap ] ) are taken from the zero - bandwidth limit which directly corresponds to the assumption of strictly `` frozen '' @xmath46-electrons : @xmath61 however , it was soon realized that the aa is not able to describe itinerant ferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that the energy levels @xmath62 are rigid and , in particular , spin - independent quantities within the aa .",
    "further it is known @xcite that the aa fulfills the sum rules ( [ mom1 ] ) , ( [ mom2 ] ) up to the order @xmath63 only and fails to reproduce the correct strong coupling behavior .",
    "note that within the aa the energy levels @xmath62 are layer - independent ( for uniform @xmath64 ) which is a crude approximation since a possible layer - dependence in the quasiparticle spectrum is suppressed almost completely .",
    "the basic idea of the maa is to exploit the information provided by the non - trivial but exact results in the limit of strong coulomb interaction ( @xmath65 ) @xcite to determine the energy levels and concentrations ( [ ap ] ) .",
    "this can most elegantly be achieved by imposing the sum rules ( [ mom1 ] ) , ( [ mom2 ] ) on the cpa equation ( [ cpa ] ) @xcite : by inserting the high energy expansion of the self - energy @xmath57 and the local green function @xmath66 , which are determined by the sum rules , the cpa equation ( [ cpa ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath67 .",
    "taking into account the sum rules up to the order @xmath45 unambiguously determines the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "then the exact strong coupling results are reproduced automatically @xcite .",

    "( [ maa ] ) are obtained from the sda results @xcite if the electron dispersion is replaced by the center of gravity of the non - interacting band .",
    "the energy levels and concentrations ( [ maa ] ) are not only dependent on the model parameters @xmath64 and @xmath2 but also on the band occupations @xmath69 and the so - called bandshift @xmath70 .",

    "thus , via ( [ maa ] ) the type of the underlying alloy changes in each step of the iteration process . in this sense @xmath70 accounts for the itineracy of the @xmath46-electrons . in the paramagnetic phase",
    "there are only minor differences in the quasiparticle spectrum between maa and aa .",
    "however , the bandshift may get a real spin - dependence for special parameter constellations .",
    "thus @xmath70 may generate and stabilize ferromagnetic solutions which are excluded within the aa .",
    "it is worth to stress that the energy levels and concentrations are implicitly temperature - dependent via @xmath69 and @xmath70 leading , therefore , to a temperature dependent electronic structure .",
    "the evaluation of the maa requires the solution of two nested selfconsistency cycles .",

    "this procedure is iterated until convergence is achieved . for efficiency reasons the numerical evaluations of the integrals in ( [ nas ] ) and ( [ bas ] ) are performed via discrete matsubara sums on the imaginary energy axis @xcite . only the spectral density and the quasiparticle density of states are calculated on the real axis at the end of each selfconsistency procedure .",

    ", only the upper subbands are shown . while the centers of gravity of the upper @xmath113 subbands are shifted to higher energies for decreasing temperatures , the lowest excitation peak in the spectral density at @xmath111 is even lowered due to the increasing bandwidth . on the other hand the width of the upper @xmath112 subband decreases .",
    "the interplay of these two correlation effects leads to an inverse exchange splitting at the lower edge of the upper subband near to the @xmath111 point .",
    "the corresponding quasiparticle density of states is , however , very small .",
    "note , that for the same reason the position of the central peak of the upper subband is almost spin- and temperature - independent .",
    "this behavior holds for both film structures for @xmath20-vectors not too far away from @xmath111 .    with help of the quasiparticle bandstructure given in fig .",

    "it is strongest near @xmath116 for fcc(100 ) and between @xmath116 and @xmath117 for fcc(111 ) .",
    "contrary to the fcc(100 ) structure all layers are fully polarized at @xmath1k for the fcc(111 ) film . in the case of ferromagnetic saturation",
    "the exchange splitting can be estimated @xcite to be at most @xmath118 $ ] , where @xmath119 is the effective bandshift between the centers of gravity of the upper quasiparticle subbands . for strong coulomb interaction @xmath120",
    "is proportional to the kinetic energy @xcite of the @xmath113 electrons in the @xmath22-th layer .",
    "note that the kinetic energy of the @xmath112 electrons vanishes for the ferromagnetic saturated state since the @xmath112 band is completely filled .",
    "we want to point out that these results strongly contrast the findings of hartree - fock theory where the exchange splitting is wavevector - independent and proportional to @xmath121 leading to substantially higher curie temperatures compared to the maa .",
    "the temperature - dependence of the electronic structure within the maa is completely different to the stoner picture of ferromagnetism .",
    "let us discuss the quasiparticle lifetime which corresponds to the width of the quasiparticle peaks . from the spectral density ( figs .",
    "[ fig_sk_g_qdos ] , [ fig_sk_qdos_100 ] , [ fig_sk_qdos_111 ] ) one can clearly read off that the lifetime of the quasiparticles is strongly spin- and temperature - dependent . for low temperatures",
    "the upper minority spectrum is sharply peaked which indicates long living quasiparticles .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the ferromagnetic saturated state a @xmath113 electron does meet a @xmath112 electron at any lattice site and thus effectively does not perform any scattering process .",
    "the width of the @xmath112 quasiparticle peaks , however , is broadened for decreasing temperature .",
    "thus in the majority spectrum the quasiparticle lifetime decreases for increasing magnetization . what concerns the lower subbands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sk_g_qdos ] ) the respective spectrum is strongly damped and the different excitations due to the five layer structure are almost indistinguishable .    for given spin and wavevector the positions of the quasiparticle peaks",
    "are layer - independent . in principle",
    ", their number corresponds to the number of layers of the film .",
    "however , due to symmetry some peaks are left out for certain layers . for thicker films the different peaks move closer together as their number increases until they build a continuum for @xmath108 which corresponds to the projection of the three dimensional bandstructure onto the surface brillouin zone . between @xmath116 and @xmath122 for fcc(100 ) and at @xmath117 for fcc(111 ) the different peaks",
    "merge together due to vanishing interlayer hopping ( @xmath123 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_sk_qdos_100 ] ,  [ fig_sk_qdos_111 ] the qdos of the surface and central layer are shown additionally .",
    "the van hove singularities resulting from the different branches of the quasiparticle dispersion are clearly visible .",
    "there are sharp van hove singularities in the minority spectrum while they are broadened for the majority spin direction because of the finite widths of the @xmath112 quasiparticle peaks due to the quasiparticle damping .",
    "finally we want to stress that the results presented above do not depend on the size of the coulomb interaction @xmath2 as long as @xmath2 is chosen from the strong - coupling region ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "contrary to hartree - fock theory , all magnetic key quantities like the curie temperature and the exchange splitting saturate as a function of @xmath2 . on the other hand , although the maa was optimized with respect to the strong coupling limit we believe that , at least qualitatively , the correlation effects in the spin- , layer- , and temperature - dependent electronic structure are valid down to intermediate coulomb interaction as well .",
    "for the investigation of spontaneous ferromagnetism and electron correlation effects in thin itinerant - electron films we have applied a generalization of the modified alloy analogy ( maa ) to the single - band hubbard model with reduced translational symmetry .",
    "the maa is based on the alloy analogy concept and is optimized with respect to correct strong coupling behavior @xcite . within the maa the actual type of the underlying alloy is not predetermined but has to be determined selfconsistently . in this sense",
    "the maa is able to account for the itineracy of the @xmath46 electrons which are considered as strictly `` frozen '' in the conventional alloy analogy ( aa ) . in the paramagnetic phase maa and aa",
    "are almost identical . however",
    ", contrary to the aa spontaneous ferromagnetic order is possible for special parameter constellations within the maa . with help of the maa the interplay of magnetism and quasiparticle damping effects can be studied in a natural way .    for an fcc(100 ) and an fcc(111 ) film geometry the layer - dependent magnetizations have been discussed as a function of temperature as well as film thickness .",
    "the magnetization in the surface layer is found to be reduced with respect to the inner layers for all thicknesses and temperatures considered . while this reduction is weak for fcc(111 )",
    "films it is pronounced in the case of an fcc(100 ) geometry . the effect of the surface is considerably stronger for fcc(100 ) films due to the higher percent of missing nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "the reduction of the surface layer magnetization is not to be expected within an hartree - fock type approach ( stoner criterion ) to the hubbard film being , therefore , a genuine effect induced by strong electron correlations .",
    "the magnetic behavior of the thin film systems can be microscopically understood by means of the spin- layer- and temperature- dependent quasiparticle bandstructure and the corresponding quasiparticle density of states .",
    "there appear two correlation induced band splittings in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "besides the hubbard splitting there is an additional exchange splitting for temperatures below @xmath114 .",
    "the demagnetization process as a function of temperature is dominated by two distinct correlation effects : a stoner - like shift in the centers of gravity of the majority and minority subbands together with a strong spin - dependent transfer of spectral weight between the upper and lower subbands .",
    "an interplay of these two effects results in curie temperatures far below the corresponding hartree - fock values .",
    "the exchange splitting is found to be strongly wavevector - dependent and is substantially different for the various quasiparticle branches in the bandstructure .",
    "the widths of the quasiparticle peaks that correspond to the quasiparticle lifetime exhibit a strong spin- and temperature - dependence .",
    "for @xmath1k the minority - spin quasiparticle peaks are sharply peaked while the majority - spin spectrum is substantially broadened .",
    "clearly the degeneracy of the 3d - bands has to be included if a direct comparison to the experiment is intended . within the present scheme",
    "this could be achieved by a similar approach as presented in @xcite which is planed for the future .",
    "however we believe the correlation effects found here to be important within a generalized hubbard model as well . in this work we have exclusively focused on purely ferromagnetic films .",
    "in addition one can examine within the same theory a phase with antiferromagnetic order between the layers .",
    "we expect such a situation to exist close to half - filling ( @xmath125 ) and for intermediate values of the coulomb interaction .",
    "further the influence of a non - magnetic top layer on the magnetic behavior of thin films can be investigated .",
