    "cosmological inflation @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite was proposed to address the horizon problem , flatness problem and monopole problem in the context of big bang cosmology . by postulating that in the early universe there was a brief period of rapid , exponential expansion one can explain , without fine - tuning , the observed facts that the universe is the same in different regions which are causally disconnected ( the horizon problem ) , the universe appears to be spatially flat ( the flatness problem ) and that there appears to be a much lower density of grand unified monopoles than one",
    "would naively expect .",
    "however , the inflation hypothesis itself has several unanswered questions : ( i ) what is the detailed mechanism for inflation ?",
    "( ii ) what precedes the inflationary phase or how does inflation  turn on \" ?",
    "( iii ) how does the universe make a graceful exit from this early , inflationary phase to standard friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) radiation dominated expansion i.e. how does inflation  turn off \" . in many of the original models @xcite @xcite @xcite inflationary expansion",
    "was driven by a phase transition at the grand unified scale . the mechanism for inflation we propose here",
    "is based on particle creation from the gravitational field and it need not occur at the same time / energy scale compared to the canonical examples of inflationary mechanisms . specifically , we focus on particle creation connected with the hawking - like radiation that occurs in frw space - time .",
    "this is similar to black hole evaporation , but time reversed . for an astrophysical size black hole hawking radiation",
    "is at first a very weak channel for mass / energy loss for the black hole . as the black hole decreases in mass due to loss from hawking radiation it gets hotter and",
    "evaporates at a faster rate . beyond some size hawking radiation",
    "becomes very strong so that near the end stages of evaporation the black hole will radiate explosively .",
    "however , near the end stages of evaporation one can no longer trust the semi - classical calculation @xcite leading to hawking radiation .",
    "one common speculation is that near the end stages of evaporation where quantum gravity should become important , that hawking radiation will  turn off \" .",
    "one concrete proposal along these lines is the suggestion that in the quantum gravity regime space - time becomes non - commutative which leads naturally to a turning off of hawking radiation in the late stages of black hole evaporation @xcite . applying these ideas to frw space - time",
    "leads to a time reversed version of black hole evaporation . during the very earliest stages of the universe when the energy density is large , so that one is in the quantum gravity regime , the hawking radiation from the frw would be turned off until the universe expanded to the point when quantum gravity started to give way to semi - classical gravity . at this point the hawking radiation of frw space - time would  turn on \" and as we show below , would drive a period of exponential expansion . as the universe expanded the hawking temperature of the frw universe would decrease until the universe becomes dominated by ordinary radiation rather than hawking radiation . at this point",
    "the universe would make a gracefully transition from inflationary expansion to the power law expansion associated with a universe dominated by ordinary radiation .",
    "already in the 1930s schrdinger @xcite put forward the idea that particle creation can influence cosmological evolution .",
    "more recently parker @xcite and others @xcite-@xcite have followed this early work of schrdinger with studies of how particle creation can affect the structure of cosmological space - times . as pointed out in @xcite",
    "there are two points about cosmological history which are well addressed by these particle creation models .",
    "first , one can explain very well the enormous entropy production in the early universe via the _ irreversible energy flow from the gravitational field to the created particles_. second , since the matter creation is an _",
    "irreversible _ process one avoids the initial singularity in cosmological space - times @xcite . in this model",
    "the universe begins from an instability of the vacuum instead of a singularity .",
    "the universe then rapidly moves through an inflationary phase followed by a radiation dominated era and finally followed by a matter / dust dominated era .",
    "our particle creation / hawking radiation model for inflation is closely tied to thermodynamics in a given space - time so we begin by collecting together some thermodynamic results .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics reads @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the heat flow into / out of the system during some interval of cosmic time from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 is the volume and @xmath6 is the thermodynamic pressure .",
    "dividing this equation by @xmath7 , gives the following differential form for the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath8 for most cosmological models the assumption is made that the universe is a _ closed , adiabatic _ system which means @xmath9 . with this assumption the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath10 , leads to a non - change in the entropy , i.e. @xmath11 , during the cosmic time interval @xmath7 .",
    "this line of reasoning contradicts the observed fact that the universe has an enormous entropy .",
    "this contradiction can be addressed by having irreversible particle creation from the gravitational field i.e. hawking radiation from an frw space - time .",
    "this irreversible particle production leads to entropy production .",
    "the change in heat , @xmath1 , is now completely due to the change of the number of particles coming from particle creation .",
    "therefore there is a transfer of energy from the gravitational field to the created matter and the universe is treated like an _ open , adiabatic _ thermodynamic system @xcite .",
    "we review the relevant parts of the frw space - time .",
    "the standard frw metric is @xmath12 , \\label{frw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the scale factor and @xmath14 is the spatial curvature of the universe ",
    "@xmath15 is flat , @xmath16 is open and @xmath17 is closed ) .",
    "the einstein field equations ( @xmath18 ) for this metric have a time - time ( @xmath19 ) component and space - space @xmath20 component given respectively by @xmath21 in the above equations @xmath4 is the energy density and @xmath6 is pressure of the matter source fluid / field .",
    "combining these two equations gives the standard conservation relationship @xmath22 , which clearly , describes the universe as a closed , adiabatic system with @xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned above this leads to @xmath11 which then seems to contradict the very large observed entropy of the universe .",
    "allowing for matter creation alters things .",
    "first in the presence of matter creation the equations are altered .",
    "the first equation on the left of remains the same but the second equation is altered and one has an additional equation for the time rate of change of particle number density .",
    "these modified and additional equations are @xcite , @xmath23 the overdot implies a time derivative , @xmath24 is particle number density , @xmath25 is the matter creation rate and @xmath26 is the pressure due to matter creation .",
    "the matter creation rate and the matter creation pressure are connected by the following relationship @xcite , @xmath27 if one assumes that @xmath4 and @xmath6 describe a normal fluid so that one has the energy condition @xmath28 ( assuming that @xmath29 this condition is known as the weak energy condition @xcite ) and in addition that the matter creation rate is positive @xmath30 one can see that @xmath26 of is positive and thus contributes a negative pressure to .",
    "such negative pressures can drive accelerated expansion such as during the early inflationary phase of the universe or during the current  dark energy \" dominated era of the universe",
    ". it would be economical if this negative pressure that occurs due to hawking radiation in frw space - time could drive both the inflationary era _ and _ the present accelerated phase of the universe which is normally attributed to dark energy",
    ". we will show that while this particle creation pressure can drive inflation it can not drive the present accelerated expansion .",
    "in the form one could easily explain both inflation and the current accelerated expansion by simply choosing a matter creation rate @xmath31 to produce whatever acceleration ( if @xmath30 ) or deceleration ( if @xmath32 ) one wants .",
    "for example , if one wants exponential expansion , @xmath33 one should choose @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "however this choice has very little physical motivation beyond giving one the result one wanted in advance .",
    "the strength of our proposal is that the particle creation comes from a specific mechanism  hawking radiation in frw space - time  and as such leads to definite predictions which allow the model to be verified or ruled out .",
    "we will see that our mechanism does in fact lead to a particle production rate @xmath35 .",
    "we now move on to a discussion of hawking radiation and associated temperature in frw space - time .",
    "since the frw space - time is dynamical , the definition of the cosmological event horizon is subtle .",
    "however one can define the apparent horizon knowing the local properties of the space - time . in order to do",
    "this one can rewrite in the following form @xcite @xmath36 where , @xmath37 and @xmath38 diag@xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the position of the apparent horizon is given by the root ( @xmath41 ) of the equation @xmath42 .",
    "expanding this equation over @xmath43 sector and simplifying we get the position of the apparent horizon ( @xmath44 ) @xcite @xmath45_{\\tilde{r}=\\tilde{r}_a } = 0 \\implies { \\tilde r}_a = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{h^2+\\frac{kc^2}{a^2}}}. ~,\\label{rah}\\ ] ]    using the above one can find the hawking temperature of the apparent horizon @xcite @xmath46 the first equality above is the standard relationship between the hawking temperature and surface gravity @xmath47 at the horizon of a given space - time .",
    "for frw space - time the surface gravity is @xmath48 .",
    "thus in general the temperature , @xmath49 , depends on both @xmath41 and its time derivative , @xmath50 .",
    "however , during an inflationary phase the universe s scale factor takes the form @xmath51 so that @xmath52 . if @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 ( later we show this is the case for our model of inflation ) we have from @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "thus the temperature in simplifies to@xcite @xmath57 in the final approximation we are again assuming @xmath54 which as mentioned above we will justify later .    before moving to a detailed calculation of how the particle creation pressure affects the evolution of the early universe in the case when this pressure comes from the particle creation from hawking radiation , we give some numerical comparisons which show that this mechanism is of the correct order of magnitude to explain inflation .",
    "considering @xmath58 to be inverse of the planck time ( @xmath59 ) gives from @xmath60 . on the other hand at planck energy ( @xmath61 ) , gives a planck temperature of @xmath62 .",
    "thus the hawking temperature of frw space - time at very early is around the planck temperature .",
    "this large temperature associated with hawking radiation of frw space - time in the early universe is a good indication that our proposed mechanism has the proper order of magnitude to be a major factor in the early evolution of the universe .",
    "our proposed hawking radiation mechanism for inflation is the inverse of black hole evaporate . for astrophysical black holes",
    "the evaporation process begins very weakly  for a black hole having the mass of our sun the temperature of the black body radiation emitted is @xmath63 .",
    "however at the end stages of evaporation when the black holes has a small mass the evaporation will proceed explosively . at this point",
    "one is not justified in using the approximations that led to hawking radiation as a thermal spectrum and it is said that one must have in hand a quantum theory of gravity to understand these end stages of black hole evaporation . for frw space - time one",
    "is not justified in using hawking radiation results at the very early stage of the universe ; one should have a theory of quantum gravity to understand this regime .",
    "as the universe expands there will be a point at which the approximations leading to hawking radiation from frw space - time become valid .",
    "it is at this point that our hawking radiation from frw space - time mechanism for inflation  turns on \" and inflation begins . as the universe inflates further the hawking temperature naturally decreases and our inflation mechanism will automatically  turn off \" .",
    "one can see that our proposed process is the inverse of black hole evaporation since the direction of radiation flux of the hawking radiation for the apparent horizon in a frw space - time is the opposite from that of a schwarzschild black hole event horizon . for black holes ,",
    "the created particles escape outside the event horizon towards asymptotic infinity , while for the apparent horizon of frw space - time the created particles come inward from the horizon . due to the isotropy of frw space - time ,",
    "the radiation is isotropic from all directions .",
    "the net result is an effective power gain in the universe , given by the stephan - boltzmann ( s - b ) radiation law . in summary",
    "the difference in the radiation direction from a schwarzschild black hole and from the frw space - time is as follows : for black holes the time rate of energy change @xmath64 is negative ( i.e. they lose power during hawking evaporation ) while for the frw space - time the time rate of energy change , @xmath64 , is positive ( i.e. the universe gains energy ) .",
    "according to the stephan - boltzmann radiation law the time rate of energy gain due to hawking radiation is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the s - b constant and @xmath67 is the area of apparent horizon .",
    "now one can substitute into but in that case the right hand side of ( which is the rate of change in energy flux through the apparent horizon ) has to be evaluated at @xmath68 , so that @xmath69_{\\tilde{r}=\\tilde{r}_a}=\\sigma a_h \\left(\\frac{\\hbar h}{2\\pi k_b}\\right)^{4 } , \\label{genrl}\\ ] ] where we have used . to calculate the left hand side we first consider the volume of a sphere of arbitrary radius by ignoring the curvature term i.e. we take @xmath15 and the volume is given by @xmath70 .",
    "note that here we take the radius at arbitrary @xmath71 . only after performing the @xmath2 derivative in we",
    "set @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand for the right hand side which represents the flow of energy across the apparent horizon we take @xmath73 where @xmath74 comes from . using these expressions for the area and volume in yields a modified continuity equation @xmath75",
    "if one ignored the effect of the hawking radiation / particle creation term on the right hand side of , by setting @xmath76 in , then becomes @xmath77 which is the usual continuity equation in the absence of particle creation .",
    "using @xmath15 and @xmath78 we now rewrite using the first equation in as @xmath79 where we have taken the equation of state for ordinary matter as @xmath80 and the time dependent equation of state due to particle creation is @xmath81 the equation of state parameter due to particle creation is @xmath82 the constant @xmath83 above is essentially the inverse of the planck energy density @xmath84 . as we will show later it is this constant @xmath83 sets the time and length scale for our inflation mechanism .",
    "this may also be different from the usual scale of inflation which is set by the grand unified scale . moving the @xmath85 term in from the right hand side to the left hand side one can see that this particle creation term acts like a negative pressure . for the present universe",
    "this term is negligible .",
    "the present value of the energy density of the universe is @xmath86 so that @xmath87 term on the right hand side of is effectively zero .",
    "thus this effective negative pressure can not explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe ",
    "one still needs dark energy .",
    "however in the early universe @xmath4 can be large enough so that the particle creation pressure on right hand side of dominates , and as we will see this can drive inflation and also give a natural  turn off \" for inflation .    at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that does not violate wald s first axiom @xcite on the energy - momentum tensor which is nothing but the usual conservation equation @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "to see this , we note that in the absence of particle creation , the right hand side of vanishes and the energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath89 which satisfies the conservation equation . however in the presence of particle creation the above definition of @xmath90 fails to simultaneously describe the conservation law and particle creation . in order to take both features into account one",
    "needs to consider a modification @xmath91 which can deal with particle creation .",
    "such a scenario is normally discussed in relationship to particle creation from black holes . since , under the appropriate choice of vacuum state (",
    "i.e. the unruh vacuum ) black holes emit real particles in the form of thermal radiation , so that there is a power loss associated with hawking radiation , it may appear that wald s first axiom is violated .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite , for such cases it is the regularized energy - momentum tensor @xmath92 which satisfies the conservation equation @xmath93 . for the unruh vacuum",
    "the regularized energy - momentum tensor is @xmath94 thus it is clear that when one is dealing with particle creation it is the regularized ( modified ) energy - momentum tensor that satisfies wald s axioms .",
    "this is exactly the picture in our case .",
    "looking into the relation one can see that the conservation equation in our case is given by @xmath95 , where the modified energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath96 in the above relation @xmath97 , @xmath98 is independent of time and given by whereas the remaining part , @xmath99 , only contains the contribution from @xmath100  the particle creation pressure due to hawking radiation .",
    "in addition to the negative pressure associated with particle creation due to hawking radiation one can also calculate the effective particle creation rate , @xmath101 , and compare with general result given in . using",
    "the equation of state @xmath102 one can re - write as @xmath103 equating with gives the time dependent matter creation rate associated with particle creation due to hawking radiation in frw space - time @xmath104 recall that in order to have exponential expansion @xmath105 one needs the creation rate from to be @xmath106 @xcite . thus from , in order to have exponential expansion ( i.e. inflation ) one needs @xmath107 to be approximately the same size as @xmath108 i.e. one needs @xmath109 if one assumes the equation of state for ordinary radiation i.e. @xmath110 . since @xmath111 where @xmath112 , this equality ( i.e. @xmath109 ) will occur when the density @xmath113 which is approximately the planck density .",
    "this density corresponds to the density in the early universe .",
    "thus the rough calculations again point toward there being a large enough matter creation rate , @xmath114 , in the early universe to drive inflationary expansion .",
    "however as the universe expands and @xmath115 drops the creation rate @xmath114 will decrease and this hawking radiation driven mechanism for inflation will turn off .",
    "we now give a detailed calculation of inflation driven by hawking radiation .",
    "inserting @xmath116 into one can integrate the resulting equation to find the energy density @xmath4 as a function of scale factor @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 is a constant and in the last equality we have taken the equation of state of the ordinary matter to be that of radiation ( i.e. @xmath120 ) since we want the early hawking radiation inflation phase to be followed by a universe dominated by ordinary radiation .",
    "the dimensions of @xmath119 depend on the value of the equation of state parameter @xmath121 .",
    "note , in the classical limit ( @xmath122 ) , @xmath123 , the frw hawking radiation effect turns off , and gives @xmath124 which is the well known result for a universe dominated by ordinary matter with an equation of state @xmath80 .",
    "there are two limits of this @xmath4 from : ( i ) @xmath125 so that @xmath126 and the hawking radiation effect dominates ; ( ii ) @xmath127 so that @xmath128 which is the energy density of an ordinary radiation dominated universe . in case ( i )",
    "the energy density is constant so that one has an effective cosmological constant which , as shown below , leads to exponential , inflationary expansion . in both cases ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) the universe is radiation dominated but for case ( i ) this means hawking radiation of an frw space - time and in case ( ii ) this means ordinary radiation . as one can see from the two limiting case behaviors of @xmath4 these two types of radiation result in very different evolution .",
    "we now want to find the time - dependence of the scale factor @xmath13 .",
    "we begin by substituting @xmath4 ( from ) into the first equation in to get a differential equation for @xmath117 as a function of @xmath2 .(recall we are assuming that @xmath129 in is zero or negligible compared to the other terms ) .",
    "it is possible to integrate the resulting equation for @xmath117 to obtain @xmath130 = \\frac{8}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi g d}{c^2}}t -(k-1 ) \\sqrt{\\alpha d } ~. \\label{soln}\\ ] ] we have written the integration constant as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is some positive number greater than @xmath133 .",
    "this will make it easier to write out some of the later formulas .",
    "one important point to make about the scale factor , @xmath13 , in is that it has an early exponential expansion phase ( the second , logarithm term on the left hand side ) which naturally transitions to a power law expansion ( the first , power law term on the left hand side ) .",
    "we will discuss these two regimes in more detail in the following subsections . that these two phases come out naturally from the proposed inflation mechanism , without need for fine - tuning some inflaton potential , is a very attractive feature . in the next following three subsections",
    "we will analyze the the early time , exponential behavior of , the later time , power - law behavior of , and then we will discuss the possible values of @xmath119 and @xmath132 .",
    "we first examine the limit of in the very early universe where @xmath13 is of a size such that one has the limit @xmath125 . in this limit",
    "becomes @xmath134 ~. \\label{inflation - era}\\ ] ] thus in this limit we find exponential expansion ( inflation ) with a hubble constant given by @xmath135 at this point we can return and justify some of our earlier assumption and approximations .",
    "first , after we assumed that @xmath136 is valid for @xmath137 near the planck size or larger ( e.g. for @xmath138 ) . for @xmath13 of the planck scale one",
    "has @xmath139 as compared to @xmath140 from eq . .",
    "second , we assumed that @xmath56 .",
    "this is also justified since from @xmath141 and during the inflationary phase @xmath58 is approximately constant with its value given by .",
    "thus @xmath142 .",
    "during inflation the standard lore is that the radius of the universe should increase by a factor of @xmath143 .",
    "thus we need @xmath144 where @xmath145 , with @xmath146 being the end and beginning time for this hawking radiation driven inflation . from",
    "we have @xmath147 sec@xmath148 so we find that gives @xmath149 sec .",
    "note that if one took the ratio in to be 10 orders larger ( i.e. @xmath150 ) this would yield @xmath151 sec .",
    "in other words the time scale for the length of this inflation is set by @xmath58 in and independent of @xmath119 and @xmath132 in .",
    "because @xmath58 in is so large one does not need a very long time , @xmath152 , in order to inflate the universe by many order of magnitude .",
    "in contrast to the above mechanism of inflation , which is driven by near - planck scale physics , the standard picture of inflation is that it is driven by physics at the grand unified scale i.e. by a grand unified phase transition . in this standard scenario inflation",
    "is thought to go from @xmath153 sec . until @xmath154 sec . or @xmath155 sec . thus for inflation driven by a phase transition at the grand unified scale one has @xmath156 sec .",

    "we take @xmath160 @xmath161 . in this range of time",
    "@xmath13 increases exponentially from planck size to about @xmath162 following the equation . because of an extremely large value of the hubble constant the lifetime of this inflation is very small .",

    "in fact the change in @xmath2 takes place after the eight decimal places and thus does not appear in the plot.__,width=566 ]    in we show two plots of @xmath164 from for the early , inflationary part of . in this figure",
    "we have set @xmath165 and two different values of @xmath132 are shown .",
    "this value of @xmath119 is justified in a subsequent section . from the two different values of @xmath132 we see",
    "that this parameter controls when inflation starts but it does not influence how long inflation last , which in this model is @xmath166 sec .      the scale function",
    "@xmath13 given in will leave the regime where the very early universe approximation in is valid , and then at some time will reach the point where @xmath167 . after this intermediate stage @xmath13 from will continue to increase until the regime is reached where @xmath127 . in this limit",
    "gives @xmath168 furthermore if the above condition is satisfied in a manner that @xmath169 , one finally finds @xmath170 this is the usual @xmath171 power law expansion for a radiation dominated universe .",

    "we consider @xmath158 and in ( b ) @xmath159 . as",
    "before we take @xmath172 and time changes after eight decimal places in ( b ) .",
    "both figures show that in these intermediate values of @xmath13 the inflationary behavior naturally makes a transition to an ordinary radiation dominated era for @xmath173 .",
    "these figures nicely capture the end of inflation and the beginning of ordinary radiation domination.__,width=566 ]    in we show two plots of @xmath117 vs. @xmath2 from which shows the beginning of the transition from exponential inflation to @xmath171 power law inflation . again in this figure we have set @xmath165 and have the same values of @xmath132 as in . again",
    "the two different values of @xmath132 control when inflation starts but they do not influence its duration .      in this subsection",
    "we want to investigate possible values of the integration constants @xmath119 and @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath119 can be set from the late time energy density of radiation . from @xcite",
    "one finds that @xmath174 which is the ratio of the radiation energy density to the critical energy density . using the value of the critical energy density ( @xmath175 ) we get @xmath176 for the present radiation energy density . equating this with @xmath177 and taking @xmath178 as the present scale factor of the universe yields @xmath165 .",
    "thus the amplitude of is @xmath179 . since for our inflationary phase scale factor @xmath13 given by",
    "we require @xmath125 ( which because of the @xmath180 power can translate to @xmath181 ) we see that in this picture inflation stops at a scale of @xmath182 rather than @xmath183 . however given the uncertainty in when exactly inflation ends this is not a fatal problem .",
    "the scale of the universe is still inflated by the same orders of magnitude  it just starts inflating a smaller scale and ends at a smaller scale .    moving on to the constant @xmath132 one can see from figs . 1 and 2 that this constant sets the time scale for when inflation starts .",
    "in plots 1(a ) and 2(a ) where @xmath132 is chosen to be @xmath184 we find that inflation starts at @xmath2 a few times larger than the planck time @xmath157 . from the figures we see that for @xmath158 inflation starts at @xmath185 to @xmath186 . on the other hand from plots 1(b ) and 2(b ) we see that for @xmath159 inflation starts at about @xmath187 sec .",
    "this start time corresponds to the standard picture where inflation is driven by a grand unified phase transition . note that even though @xmath132 can shift the starting time of inflation , it can not control the duration which is fixed at @xmath188sec",
    "in the previous section we sketched a model for inflation driven by hawking radiation of frw space - time which has a natural  turn off \" or graceful exit from inflation .",
    "we now offer speculation that this model of inflation driven by hawking radiation may also have a natural  turn on \" or entrance to inflation . as already noted the process for inflation suggested here",

    "the hawking radiation of frw space - time will be a weak / minor effect just as hawking radiation is weak / minor effect at the beginning ( i.e. early stage ) of black hole evaporation . during inflation ( i.e. the very early stage ) described in the section above the frw hawking radiation effect",
    "is dominate , just as during the end ( i.e. very late stage ) of black hole evaporation the hawking radiation is dominate .    during the very late stages of evaporation of a black hole there are speculations that quantum gravity effects will turn off hawking radiation .",
    "one particularly concrete example of this is in the non - commutative geometry scenario @xcite where , as the planck scale is approached , space - time become non - commutative @xmath189=i \\theta ^{\\mu \\nu } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath190 is an anti - symmetric rank 2 tensor which has the dimensions of distance squared . as a result of this non - commutativity black holes can not evaporate to arbitrarily small size , but due to the implied uncertainty relationship between spatial coordinates ",

    "detailed analysis @xcite shows that as a black hole evaporates in the non - commutative space - time characterized by it reaches some maximum temperature after which the black hole temperature will decrease as the black hole continues to evaporate . at some point",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole goes to zero , the evaporation process stops and one is left with a non - radiating remnant @xcite . applying this picture to the frw hawking radiation model of inflation",
    "one would find that in the very early universe , as during the late stages of black hole evaporation , the size of the universe would be small and the frw hawking temperature would be zero . thus at this early stage there would be no inflation since the frw hawking radiation would be  turned off \" .",
    "the universe would expand  normally \" according to a power law like . at some point the universe would reach a size large enough not to be dominated by the uncertainty relationship coming from the noncommutative space - time relationship of . at this point",
    "the frw hawking radiation would  turn on \" and drive inflation until the universe transitioned from the regime @xmath125 to the regime @xmath127 .",
    "when the universe entered this regime ( i.e. @xmath127 ) it would undergo power law type of expansion given in rather than the inflationary expansion of .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a mechanism for inflation based on the particle creation due to hawing radiation in an frw space - time .",
    "this mechanism differs from the model of inflation driven by some phase transition at the grand unified scale .",
    "this can be seen in the different time scales  inflation driven by a grand unified phase transition is thought to start at @xmath153 sec . and",
    "last until @xmath194 sec .",
    ", thus having @xmath195 sec .",
    "because of the large value of @xmath58 in ( or alternatively the small value of @xmath83 in ) the time scale of our proposed mechanism for inflation is @xmath196 sec . which is different than the standard time for inflation",
    ". there are two constant , @xmath119 and @xmath132 , which arise in the solution of the scale factor .",
    "the constant @xmath119 is determined by matching the theoretical late - time energy density ( @xmath128 ) with the observed value of the present day radiation energy density ( @xmath197 ) and the present day value of @xmath178 . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath165 .",
    "we also get a the amplitude of the inflationary period expression for @xmath13 as given in namely @xmath198 .",
    "this means that this model of inflation ends when @xmath199 .",
    "this is six orders of magnitude smaller than the standard picture of inflation which ends at @xmath200 .",
    "however the scale factor in our model still inflates in size by a factor of @xmath143 . in this",
    "picture inflation exits at a smaller scale factor than in the canonical picture .",
    "the other constant @xmath132 simply shifts when inflation starts , but does not control the duration . from figs . 1 and 2 one",
    "can see for @xmath201 inflation starts near the planck time while for @xmath202 inflations starts near @xmath203 sec  the standard starting time in inflation driven by a grand unified phase transition .    because for some values of @xmath132 the starting time of inflation can be near the planck time one should worry , for these values of @xmath132 , about the validity of the calculation of the hawking radiation .",
    "for one , near the planck scale the constants @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 could be different from the present day values .",
    "in particular since @xmath83 in  and therefore @xmath58 in  depend on @xmath204 to the seventh power , having a different value of @xmath204 at these early , near - planck times by even one order of magnitude would greatly change the scale of hawking radiation driven inflation mechanism proposed here . if @xmath204 were one order of magnitude smaller in these very early times the energy scale of the hawking radiation driven inflation would shift to be more in line with that of the grand unified phase transition mechanism for inflation . in this paper",
    "we simply stick to the simplest assumption  that @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206  have the present , constant values even at these early , near - planck times .",
    "we hope later to investigate the possibility that @xmath204 , @xmath205 and/or @xmath206 have different value at these early times .    in this picture of hawking radiation driven inflation",
    "the time scale is set by @xmath83 in .",
    "setting aside this definite scale prediction for a moment - allowing for an arbitrary scale @xmath83 - we note that one might regard , and the resulting scale factor @xmath13 in , as a good phenomenological model for the time development of the size of the universe which naturally includes exponential expansion with power law expansion in a single expression .",
    "the inflation mechanism presented here is the time reversal of black hole evaporation . for a black hole in the _ early stages _ of evaporation via hawking radiation , the radiation is a weak effect , barely changing the mass and space - time of the black hole ; for an frw universe in its _ late stages _ the hawking radiation is a weak effect having effectively no effect on the expansion rate of the universe . for a black hole in the _ late stages _ of evaporation via hawking radiation , the radiation is a dominant effect , which plays a significant role in the change of the black hole s mass and the structure of the space - time ; for an frw universe in its _ early stages _ the hawking radiation is a huge effect and leads to an enormous expansion rate for the universe . in the _ very late stages _ of black hole evaporation",
    "it is postulated that quantum gravity effects will shut off hawking radiation ; for an frw space - time we postulate that in the _ very early stages _ quantum gravity effects will shut off hawking radiation and the associated exponential expansion .",
    "there have been other works that have studied the role of particle creation in the evolution of the universe @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the present proposal is similar to the work of @xcite which views particle creation as an irreversible process from energy transfer and entropy production from the gravitational field to the particles .",
    "the difference in the present work is that we have proposed a very specific particle creation mechanism namely the hawking radiation associated with frw space - time",
    ". the frw hawking radiation gives rise to an effective negative pressure evolution equation for the energy density , @xmath4 , .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 given in leads to a time dependent scale factor @xmath13 given in which has two regimes  one where @xmath125 with the resulting @xmath13 being exponential / inflationary expansion as given in and one where @xmath127 with the resulting @xmath13 being power law expansion as given in .",
    "there is a natural transition from inflationary expansion to power law expansion so that this model for inflation has a graceful exit from inflationary behavior .",
    "finally based on the inverse similarity between black hole evaporation and this frw hawking radiation model of the evolution of the scale factor @xmath13 , where the period of late time black hole evaporation corresponds to early period of the universe ( and visa versa ) , we have given some speculation as to how frw hawking radiation mechanism for inflation may  turn on \" due to non - commutative space - time effects .",
    "thus the frw hawking radiation picture for the evolution of @xmath13 provides not only a graceful exit to inflation as well as a possible graceful entrance .",
    "one final comment - this inflation mechanism has a feedback mechanism which forces the scale factor , @xmath13 , to be uniform .",
    "for example , if one assumed that the scale factor also had a dependence on @xmath207 ( i.e. @xmath208 ) the hawking radiation inflation mechanism would tend to erase this @xmath207 dependence . if , @xmath208 were smaller for some @xmath207 this would imply a higher hawking temperature and more rapid expansion .",
    "this would push those regions of @xmath207 with smaller scale factor , @xmath117 , to expand more rapidly until they were the same as the scale factor in other regions .",
    "if , @xmath208 were larger for some @xmath207 this would imply a lower hawking temperature and less rapid expansion .",
    "this would push those regions of @xmath207 with larger scale factor , @xmath117 , to expand less rapidly until they were the same as the scale factor in other regions ."
