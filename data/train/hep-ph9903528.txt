    "supersymmetric gauge field theories are among the most promising models for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) solves the so - called hierarchy problem , which basically follows from the tremendous scale differences in realistic models including gravity .",
    "after susy breaking , susy models , e.g. the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have over hundred free parameters in general .",
    "most of these new parameters in the mssm are in fact related to the susy breaking , i.e. gaugino masses @xmath3 , soft scalar masses @xmath4 , susy breaking trilinear couplings @xmath5 and susy breaking bilinear couplings .",
    "they are expected to be of the order of 1  tev .",
    "to probe the susy breaking mechanisms is very important in order to produce solid information on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "two types of susy breaking mechanisms , gravity - mediated susy breaking and gauge - mediated susy breaking , have been actively studied in recent years .",
    "the signatures of gravity mediated and gauge mediated susy breaking are quite different .",
    "a specific susy breaking mechanism usually reduces the number of _ a priori _ free parameters from about one hundred to only a few by introducing solid relations among the susy breaking parameters .",
    "this makes the phenomenology of the mssm more accessible for study .    for phenomenology of susy models ,",
    "various aspects have been studied in several regions of the parameter space .",
    "most phenomenological analyses have been done under the assumption that the soft susy breaking parameters are universal , i.e. @xmath6 for @xmath7 , @xmath8 for any scalar and @xmath9 at a certain energy scale , e.g. the planck scale or the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale . from the phenomenological viewpoint ,",
    "the universality assumption is useful to simplify analysis .",
    "actually , the universal parameters can be derived from a certain type of underlying theories , e.g. minimal supergravity .    however",
    ", the universality assumption may remove some interesting degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , there exist interesting classes of models in which non - universal soft susy breaking terms can be derived .",
    "for example , string - inspired supergravity can lead to non - universality for susy breaking parameters at the planck scale @xcite . also , gauge - mediated susy breaking models , in general , lead to non - universality @xcite .",
    "recently phenomenological implications of non - universal susy breaking parameters have been investigated .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite phenomenological implications have been studied for non - universal gaugino masses derived from string models .",
    "guts without a singlet also lead to non - universal gaugino masses @xcite . in ref.@xcite phenomenological aspects in the small @xmath10 scenario",
    "have been discussed , e.g. mass spectra and some decay modes .",
    "some phenomenological constraints reduce the allowed region of the universal susy breaking parameters a lot .",
    "for example , in the large @xmath10 scenario , it is hard to fulfill the constraints due to the requirement of successful electroweak breaking , susy corrections to the bottom mass @xcite and the @xmath2 decay rate @xcite .",
    "these constraints can be relaxed in non - universal cases .    in this paper",
    ", we study phenomenological aspects of susy @xmath0 guts where the gaugino masses come from a condensation of @xmath11-component with a representation * 24 * , * 75 * or * 200*. each of them leads to a proper pattern of non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "we mostly concentrate on the large @xmath10 scenario .",
    "we take into account the full one - loop effective potential of the mssm , in order to calculate the physical spectrum of the mssm , given the initial conditions at the gut scale . in particular , we investigate constraints from the requirement of successful electroweak symmetry breaking , the positivity of stau mass squared and the @xmath2 decay rate .",
    "we take susy corrections to the bottom quark mass carefully into account .",
    "we then find the allowed parameter space for each model and describe the particle spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 susy",
    "@xmath0 guts with non - universal gaugino masses are reviewed . in section 3",
    "we study their phenomenological aspects , i.e. successful radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry , the lsp mass , the stau mass , susy corrections to the bottom mass and the @xmath2 decay .",
    "we also give comments on small @xmath10 cases .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we discuss the non - universality of soft susy breaking gaugino masses in susy @xmath0 gut and the constraints on parameters at the gut scale @xmath12 in our analysis .",
    "the gauge kinetic function is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are indices related to gauge generators , @xmath15 s are chiral superfields and @xmath16 is the @xmath0 gaugino field .",
    "the scalar and @xmath11-compontents of @xmath15 are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15 s are classified into two categories .",
    "one is a set of @xmath0 singlet supermultiplets @xmath19 and the other one is a set of non - singlet ones @xmath20 .",
    "the gauge kinetic function @xmath21 is , in general , given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions of gauge singlets @xmath19 and @xmath25 is the reduced planck mass defined by @xmath26 . since the gauge multiplets are in adjoint representation , one finds the possible representations of @xmath20 with non - vanishing @xmath24 by decomposing the symmetric product @xmath27 as @xmath28 thus , the representations of @xmath20 allowed as a linear term of @xmath20 in @xmath21 are * 24 * , * 75 * and * 200*.    here we make two basic assumptions .",
    "the first one is that susy is broken by non - zero vevs of @xmath11-components @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gravitino mass .",
    "the second one is that the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken down to the standard model gauge symmetry @xmath32 by non - zero vevs of non - singlet scalar fields @xmath33 at the gut scale @xmath12 .",
    "after the breakdown of @xmath0 , the gauge couplings @xmath34 s of @xmath35 , are , in general , non - universal at the scale @xmath12 @xcite as we see from the formula @xmath36 .",
    "the index @xmath37 represents @xmath38 generators as a whole .",
    "the gaugino field acquires soft susy breaking mass after susy breaking .",
    "the mass formula is given by @xmath39 thus the @xmath3 s are also , in general , non - universal at the scale @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "next we will consider the constraints on the physical parameters used at the scale @xmath12 for the analysis in this paper .",
    "+ 1 ) gauge couplings + we take a gauge coupling unification scenario within the framework of the mssm , that is , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42gev .",
    "the relation ( [ gaugecoupling ] ) leads to @xmath43 .",
    "we neglect the contribution of non - universality to the gauge couplings .",
    "such corrections of order @xmath44 have little effects on phenomenological aspects which we will discuss in the next section , although such corrections would be important for precision study on the gauge coupling unification .",
    "+ 2 ) gaugino masses + we assume that dominant component of gaugino masses comes from one of non - singlet @xmath11-components .",
    "the vev of the @xmath11-component of a singlet field whose scalar component @xmath45 has a vev of @xmath46 in @xmath47 is supposed to be small enough @xmath48 such as dilaton multiplet in moduli - dominant susy breaking in string models . in this case ,",
    "ratios of gaugino masses at @xmath12 are determined by group theoretical factors and shown in table  i. the patterns of gaugino masses which stem from @xmath11-term condensation of * 24 * , * 75 * and * 200 * are different from each other .",
    "the table also shows corresponding ratios at the weak scale @xmath49 based on mssm . in the table ,",
    "gaugino masses are shown in the normalization @xmath50 .",
    "note that the signs of @xmath3 are also fixed by group theory up to an overall phase as shown in table 1 .",
    "there is no direct experimental constraint on these signs .",
    "for example , these signs affect radiative corrections of @xmath51-terms and thus off - diagonal elements of sfermion matrices , that is , radiative corrections of @xmath3 to @xmath52 are constructive in the universal case , while in the model * 24 * radiative corrections between @xmath53 and the others interfere with each other leading to @xmath54 reduction . in the other cases , the radiative corrections are larger by @xmath55 than the universal case .",
    "+   + 3 ) scalar masses + for simplicity , we assume universal soft susy breaking scalar masses @xmath56 at @xmath12 in our analysis in order to clarify phenomenological implications of non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath56 is supposed not to be too large compared with that of @xmath3 s in order not to overclose the universe with a huge amount of relic abundance of the lightest neutralino @xcite .",
    "the non - universal gaugino masses @xmath3 and scalar masses @xmath57 may have sizable susy threshold corrections for running of gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "these threshold effects and non - universal contributions of @xmath58 in @xmath59 will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in this section , we study several phenomenological aspects of susy @xmath0 guts with non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "the patterns of the gaugino masses in the models are different from each other as shown in table  i. that leads to different phenomenology in these models .",
    "for example , in the model * 24 * we have a large gap between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 . in the model * 75 * gaugino masses are almost degenerate at the weak scale . in the model * 200 * , @xmath63 is smallest .",
    "some phenomenological aspects have been previously studied in the case with low @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we will study the case of a large value of @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath64 .",
    "we take the trilinear scalar couplings , the so - called @xmath51-terms , to vanish at the gut - scale .",
    "similarly , the case with non - vanishing @xmath51-terms can be studied , but the conclusions remain qualitatively unchanged . also we ignore the supersymmetric @xmath65-violating phase of the bilinear scalar coupling of the two higgs fields , the so - called @xmath66-term .",
    "assuming vanishing @xmath51-terms and a real @xmath66-term , we have no susy - cp problem . ignoring the complex phases",
    "has no significant effect on the results of this work , although they would naturally be very relevant to the problem of cp - violation .",
    "we could fix magnitudes of the supersymmetric higgs mixing mass @xmath67 and @xmath66 by assuming some generation mechanism for the @xmath67-term .",
    "however , we do not take such a procedure here .",
    "we will instead fix these magnitudes by use of the minimization conditions of the higgs potential as shall be shown .",
    "given the quantum numbers of @xmath68 irreducible representation , one can characterize the models as a function of four parameters : @xmath1 , the gluino mass @xmath69 at the gut scale , the universal mass of the scalar fields @xmath70 at the gut scale and the sign of the @xmath67-term @xmath71 .",
    "we will check the compatibility of the model with the experimental branching ratio @xmath2 . since this branching ratio increases with @xmath10",
    ", we will study the four models at the region of large @xmath10 , taking @xmath72 as a representative value and scanning over the gaugino mass and the scalar mass squared term .",
    "we require that the gauge coupling constants unify at the scale @xmath73gev .",
    "successful electroweak symmetry breaking is an important constraint .",
    "the one - loop effective potential written in terms of the vevs , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , is @xmath76 where @xmath77 , \\label{eq : potform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the spin and the number of degrees of freedom . here",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 denote soft susy breaking higgs masses .",
    "we use the minimization conditions of the full one - loop effective potential , @xmath82 so that we can write @xmath83 and @xmath84 in terms of other parameters , that is , the soft scalar masses , the gaugino masses and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the values determined only by use of the tree - level potential , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the corrections due to the full one - loop potential , which are obtained @xmath89 numerically , the most significant one - loop contribution to @xmath88 and @xmath90 comes from the ( s)top and ( s)bottom loops  @xcite .",
    "successful electroweak symmetry breaking requires @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , we require the mass squared eigenvalues for all scalar fields to be non - negative .",
    "in particular , in the large @xmath10 scenario the stau mass squared becomes easily negative due to large negative radiative corrections from the yukawa coupling against positive radiative corrections from the gaugino masses .",
    "these constraints are shown in fig.1 . in the model * 1 * with the universal gaugino mass , requirement of proper electroweak symmetry breaking excludes the region with very small ( @xmath92 gev ) scalar mass and gaugino masses . in the model",
    "@xmath93 the region where radiative symmetry breaking fails is considerably larger than in the model * 1 * because of negative @xmath94 for small @xmath56 . in the model @xmath93 @xmath63 and @xmath60",
    "are quite small compared with @xmath61 .",
    "such small values of @xmath63 and @xmath60 are not enough to push up @xmath95 against large negative radiative correction due to the yukawa coupling .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the model * 75 * large gaugino masses drive the higgs boson mass - squared @xmath96 to very large positive values at the susy scale . this aspect combined with the contribution from the effective potential correction makes @xmath97 small and negative at large gaugino masses . as a result , in the model",
    "* 75 * there are no consistent solutions having large gluino mass @xmath98 gev .",
    "furthermore , around the border to the region with @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 gev , the magnitude of @xmath101 is very small , and the lightest neutralino and the lighter chargino are almost higgsinos .",
    "thus , the region around the border @xmath100 gev is excluded by the experimental lower bound of the chargino mass , @xmath102 gev .",
    "the region with @xmath103 gev leads to large @xmath101 enough to predict @xmath104 gev . in the model * 200 * radiative symmetry breaking works for all the scanned values .    from the experimental point of view ,",
    "a crucial issue is the nature of the lsp , since it is a decisive factor in determing signals of the models in detectors .",
    "one candidate for the lsp is the lightest neutralino @xmath105 . in the large @xmath10 scenario ,",
    "the lightest stau is another possibility .",
    "1 show what is the lsp for the four models .",
    "they also show the excluded region by the current experimental limit @xmath106 gev  @xcite .",
    "the limit on the stau mass excludes the models * 1 * and * 24 * having small scalar masses .",
    "the models * 75 * and * 200 * , on the other hand , always have relatively heavy stau , independent of the susy parameters , and in the latter two models the neutralino is always the lsp .",
    "for the models * 1 * and * 24 * , the content of the lsp is similar and narrow regions lead to the stau lsp .    in our models",
    "the present experimental lower bound of the higgs mass does not provide a strong constraint , because in the large @xmath1 scenario the higgs mass is heavy .",
    "we also consider the constraint due to the @xmath107 decay .",
    "the prediction of the @xmath107 decay branching ratio  @xcite should be within the current experimental bounds @xcite @xmath108 combined with the theoretical uncertainty in the sm prediction ( @xmath109 ) the branching ratio must be between 0.3 and 1.4 times the sm prediction .",
    "as expected , the constraint is very strong for negative mu - term @xmath110   @xcite .",
    "] , because the supersymmetric contributions interfere constructively to the amplitude , causing the branching ratio to exceed the experimental bound .",
    "figs .  1 show excluded regions due to @xmath111 for the four models with @xmath110 .",
    "we have taken into account squark mixing effects .",
    "these excluded regions are similar for the four models . the regions with small gluino masses @xmath112 gev are ruled out due to too large @xmath107 branching ratio in the four models unless @xmath113 tev .",
    "in addition , the model * 75 * has an excluded region with @xmath98 gev due to the unsuccessful electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , in the model * 75 * with @xmath110 only a narrow region for @xmath69 is allowed for @xmath114 tev . in the case with positive mu - term @xmath115",
    "the constraints are much weaker , only some models with small gluino and soft scalar masses are ruled out due to the charged higgs contribution .",
    "the superpartner - loop corrections to the bottom - quark yukawa coupling become numerically sizable for large @xmath10 .",
    "these corrections are significant for precise prediction of the bottom mass .",
    "thus , we also show how these susy - corrections to the bottom mass depend on our models with non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "the threshold effect can be expressed as @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the bottom quark yukawa couplings in the standard model and mssm , respectively .",
    "the dominant part of the corrections is given by @xmath118 , \\label{eq : deltab}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the top yukawa coupling and @xmath120    the sign of @xmath121 is the same as the one of @xmath67 . figs .",
    "2 show for the four models the regions with @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "most of the allowed regions in the models * 1 * and * 24 * lead to @xmath123 for @xmath125 , while most of the allowed region in the model * 75 * leads to @xmath122 . in the model",
    "* 200 * , small @xmath56 leads to @xmath123 , while large @xmath56 leads to @xmath122 .",
    "the large correction to the bottom mass affects the @xmath126 yukawa coupling unification , which is one of interesting aspects in guts .",
    "we assume the @xmath126 yukawa coupling unification at the gut scale and use the experimental value @xmath127 gev . without the susy correction @xmath121 we would have @xmath128 gev for @xmath129 .",
    "the present experimental value of the bottom mass contains large uncertainties : ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , gives @xmath130 while the analysis of the @xmath131 system @xcite and the lattice result @xcite give @xmath132 gev and @xmath133 gev , respectively , which translate into @xmath134 thus , the negative susy corrections , that is @xmath135 , with @xmath123 are favored for @xmath125 . hence most of the region in the model @xmath136 leads to too small @xmath137 to fit the experimental value for @xmath125 .",
    "the susy correction @xmath121 is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in the case with large @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath138 and 55 , some parameter regions in the model * 75 * as well as the model * 200 * become more favorable . because the prediction @xmath128 gev without the susy correction @xmath121 is similar for @xmath129 , 50 and 55 .",
    "finally we show sparticle spectra in the regions allowed by the electroweak breaking conditions and the constraint due to @xmath139 for @xmath125 and @xmath110 .",
    "the whole particle spectrum is fixed by gluino mass @xmath69 , the soft scalar mass @xmath56 and @xmath10 .",
    "the sign of the @xmath67-term @xmath140 has numerically insignificant effect to the mass spectrum . in the case of negative @xmath67-term the experimental upper bound to the @xmath107 decay branching ratio",
    "severely restricts the parameter space . as an example",
    ", we show mass spectra of the four models for @xmath141=(800,400)$ ] and @xmath142 in table  ii .",
    "these parameters correspond to almost smallest mass parameters allowed by theoretical and experimental considerations common in the four models .",
    "most of the non - sm degrees of freedom have masses around 1 tev .",
    "note that the model * 75 * with @xmath143 gev and @xmath144 gev predicts very small @xmath101 and the lightest chargino mass , which is actually excluded by the experimental lower bound . on the other hand ,",
    "the model * 24 * for small @xmath69 predicts a very small mass of the lightest neutralino .    in the models *",
    "75 * and * 200 * the lightest neutralino @xmath145 and the lightest chargino @xmath146 are almost degenerate .",
    "this would potentially create a very difficult experimental setup  @xcite .",
    "the charginos would be extremely difficult to detect , at least near the kinematical production threshold : as the charginos decay practically all of the reaction energy is deposited into the invisible lsp neutralinos . if the charginos decay very close to the interaction point , the photon background would quite effectively hide the signal",
    ". the chargino would be easy to detect only if it is sufficiently stable , having a decay length of at least millimeters .    in the models * 1 * and * 24 * , the lsp is almost the bino .",
    "on the other hand , the wino - like lsp or the higgsino - like lsp can be realised in the models * 75 * and * 200*. in particular , the model * 75 * has the region around @xmath100 gev where the higgsino is very light .",
    "these different patterns of mass spectra also have cosmological implications , which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have assumed universal soft scalar mass at the gut scale in order to concentrate on phenomenological implications of the non - universal gaugino masses , but we give some comments on non - universal soft scalar masses .",
    "certain types of non - universalities can relax the given constraints .",
    "for example , the non - universality between the stau mass and the others is important for the constraint @xmath147 and obviously a large value of the stau mass at the gut can remove the excluded region . for the electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "the non - universality between the higgs masses @xmath148 and @xmath149 is interesting and a large difference of @xmath150 enlarges the parameter region for the succesful electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we give a comment for the small @xmath10 scenario . for small @xmath10 , the stau ( mass)@xmath151 has no sizable and negative radiative corrections .",
    "thus , the constraints @xmath152 and @xmath106gev are no longer serious . in addition",
    "most cases lead to the neutralino lsp .",
    "furthermore , the susy contributions to @xmath153 is roughly proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the constraint due to @xmath154 is also relaxed for small @xmath10 .",
    "we have studied the large @xmath10 scenario of the susy model in which the gaugino masses are not universal at the gut scale .",
    "we find that the gluino mass at the electroweak scale is restricted to multi - tev values due to experimental limits on the @xmath155 decay for @xmath156 . in the model",
    "* 75 * the allowed region is narrow for @xmath69 . we find that in two of the models * 1 * and * 24 * we have neutralino lsp and stau nlsp , while in the models * 75 * and * 200 * the lightest neutralino and the lighter chargino are almost mass degenerate",
    ". this would provide for quite different kind of the first signature for the mssm as is usually assumed within the minimal supergravity scenario .",
    "we have also calculated the susy correction to the bottom mass @xmath121 .",
    "the model * 75 * , as well as the model * 200 * with large @xmath56 , leads to smaller @xmath121 than the others .",
    "we have possibilities that gaugino fields acquire a different pattern of non - universal masses .",
    "for example , there is the case that some linear combination of @xmath11-components of * 1 * , * 24 * , * 75 * and * 200 * contributes to gaugino masses .",
    "it is pointed out that there exists a model - independent contribution to gaugino masses from the conformal anomaly @xcite .",
    "furthermore , soft scalar masses and @xmath51-parameters at the gut scale can , in general , be non - universal .",
    "we leave these types of extension to future work .",
    "* note added : *    after completion of this paper , ref.@xcite appears , where several signals of the @xmath0 guts with non - universal gaugino masses have been discussed for @xmath157 and 25 .",
