    "the fundamental importance of the search for @xmath1 decay is widely accepted ( see , e.g. the _ aps study of physics of neutrinos _",
    "observing the decay would tell us that the total lepton number is not a conserved quantity , and that , consequently , neutrinos are massive majorana fermions . experimental searches for the @xmath1 decay , of ever increasing sensitivity , are being pursued worldwide ( for a recent review of the field , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , interpreting existing results as a measurement of the neutrino effective mass , and planning new experiments , depends crucially on the knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements that govern the decay rate .",
    "accurate determination of the nuclear matrix elements , and a realistic estimate of their uncertainty , is therefore an integral part of the study .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements for @xmath1 decay must be evaluated using tools of nuclear structure theory . unfortunately , there are no observables that could be directly linked to the magnitude of @xmath1 nuclear matrix elements and that could be used to determine them in an essentially model independent way . in the past ,",
    "knowledge of the @xmath6-decay rate and of the ordinary @xmath7 decay @xmath8 values were used to constrain the nuclear model parameters , in particular when the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) was employed @xcite . clearly , when other relevant data become available , and the nuclear model is constrained to reproduce them , confidence in the deduced @xmath1 nuclear matrix elements would increase . recently a set of such data , the occupation numbers of neutron valence orbits in the initial @xmath0ge and final @xmath0se nuclei , were determined in a series of measurements of cross sections for neutron adding and removing transfer reactions @xcite .",
    "a similar series of measurements involving proton transfer reactions also became recently available @xcite .",
    "here we examine in detail how sensitive the matrix elements are to these quantities , and how much the previously determined nuclear matrix elements change when the input of the nuclear model is modified so that occupancies of individual orbits are correctly reproduced . as in the previous calculations @xcite",
    ", we use the qrpa method and its generalizations .",
    "the occupation numbers for orbits with angular momentum @xmath9 ( and any other quantum numbers ) in the initial nucleus , measured experimentally , are simply @xmath10 and the same quantity is determined for the ground state @xmath11 of the final nucleus . here",
    "@xmath12 is the creation operator for a proton in the orbit @xmath13 or a neutron in the orbit @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the corresponding annihilation operator .",
    "the states @xmath16 and @xmath11 are the true ground states with all correlations in them .    theoretically ,",
    "for pure pairing bcs wave functions , the occupation numbers @xmath17 depend only on the amplitudes @xmath18 or @xmath19 that are obtained by solving the gap equations .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath20 are constrained by the requirement that the expectation value of the total neutron and proton numbers are conserved , i.e. , @xmath21 here , and in the following , we use @xmath22 and @xmath23 to label all quantum numbers of the corresponding neutron or proton orbits .",
    "however , in the correlated qrpa ground state the occupation numbers are no longer the pure bcs quantities .",
    "instead , they depend , in addition , on the solutions of the qrpa equations of motion for all multipoles @xmath24 , and can be evaluated using @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26_{00 } | 0^+_{qrpa } \\rangle\\ ] ] is the expectation value of the number of quasiparticles in the orbit @xmath27 .",
    "( here @xmath28 are the creation and annihilitation operators for the quasiparticle with quantum numbers @xmath29 . )",
    "the quasiparticle occupation numbers @xmath30 can be obtained iteratively using the equations of motion of the renormalized quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) and of the selfconsistent rqrpa(srqrpa ) through the renormalization factors @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "note that the occupation numbers @xmath34 are no longer constrained by the same requirement , eq.([eq : bcs2 ] ) , that the particle number is conserved on average , as the bcs occupation numbers are .",
    "the past applications of qrpa to the evaluation of the @xmath1 nuclear matrix elements used standard parametrizations of the nuclear mean field , usually in the form of the coulomb corrected woods - saxon potential fitted globally to a variety of nuclear properties ( typically used parameters are those quoted in @xcite or in @xcite ) . in few papers",
    "@xcite attempts were made to modify the single particle energy input in order to better describe the energy levels of the @xmath35-decay candidate nuclei .",
    "it turns out that , at least in the @xmath36 case , the quantities @xmath37 based on the woods - saxon potential single particle energies , do not agree well with the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the occupancy of the neutron @xmath38 orbit appears to be underestimated .",
    "shortly after the data of ref.@xcite became available , a new publication @xcite appeared , where the neutron single particle energies ( only the valence orbits @xmath39 ) were modified so that the neutron number occupancies of @xmath0ge and @xmath0se , for which the quantities @xmath40 were used , were better reproduced .",
    "the proton mean field energies were also modified so that the one - quasiparticle energies in the odd - z nuclei @xmath41as and @xmath41br were also better described .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite conclude that this modifications result in sizable reduction of the @xmath1 nuclear matrix element for the @xmath0ge @xmath2 @xmath0se transition .    in the present work",
    "we carefully analyze the rle of the constraints represented by the knowledge of the orbit occupancies @xmath42 .",
    "clearly , these quantities reflect presence of correlations beyond pairing correlations described by @xmath40 . as a closest substitute for these correlations we use here @xmath34 . moreover , to describe such correlations",
    ", we use the srqrpa that , as the simple bcs , and unlike the qrpa or rqrpa , conserves the neutron and proton particle numbers on average .",
    "( we describe the method in more detail in the next section ) .",
    "let us stress that the comparison between the measured and calculated occupancies in the experimental refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as in the theoretical paper @xcite , was based on equating the experimental values @xmath43 with the bcs values @xmath37 . as pointed out above this",
    "is not really a justified comparison as far as the qrpa and its generalizations are concerned .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the srqrpa method , and illustrate the effect of qrpa correlations on the occupation numbers . in section iii",
    "we discuss the modifications of the mean field energies for the @xmath44 = 76 system that results in better description of the occupation numbers of valence orbits .",
    "we also show that using the modified mean field energies improves the description of the contribution of low - lying states to the @xmath6 matrix element . in section",
    "iv we present our result for the @xmath0ge @xmath2 @xmath0se @xmath1 nuclear matrix element and show that the mean field adjustment needed in order to better describe the orbit occupancies leads to reduction of the difference between the qrpa and nuclear shell model results @xcite .",
    "analogous modifications are applied in section v to the @xmath4 system with two more protons and four more neutrons then in @xmath45 .",
    "it also results in a noticeable reduction of @xmath46 for the @xmath5se @xmath1 decay .",
    "we describe the contribution of individual orbits to the @xmath1 matrix element in section vi and conclude in section vii .",
    "the standard qrpa method consists of two steps .",
    "first , the like - particle pairing interaction is taken into account by employing the quasiparticle representation . in the second step",
    "the linearized equations of motion are solved in order to describe small amplitude vibrational - like modes around that minimum . in the renormalized version of qrpa",
    "the violation of the pauli exclusion principle is partially corrected .",
    "the drawback of qrpa and rqrpa is the fact that , unlike in bcs , and as mentioned already earlier , the particle number is not conserved automatically , even on average , i.e. , @xmath47 and the same is true for the proton states . naturally , in the limit of negligibly small amplitudes , when the quasiparticle occupation numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eq.([eq : qrpa ] ) are small , the inequality in ( [ eq : ineq ] ) is correspondingly small as well .",
    "however , for realistic hamiltonians the differences between the left - hand and right - hand sides of eq.([eq : ineq ] ) in qrpa is of the order of unity ( an extra or missing neutron or proton ) .",
    "the selfconsitent renormalized qrpa method ( srqrpa ) removes this drawback by treating the bcs and qrpa vacua simultaneously . for the neutron - proton systems , of interest in the present context",
    ", the method was proposed and tested on the exactly solvable simplified models in refs @xcite .",
    "it is a generalization of the procedure proposed earlier in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly describe the basic features of srqrpa . in qrpa , rqrpa and",
    "srqrpa the phonon operators are defined as @xmath50 ~ , \\label{eq : phonon}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the usual variational amplitudes , and @xmath53 is the angular momentum coupled two - quasiparticle creation operator .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath55 amplitudes , as well as the corresponding energy eigenvalues @xmath56 are determined by solving the qrpa eigenvalue equations for each @xmath57 @xmath58 the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 above are determined by the hamiltonian rewritten in terms of the coupled quasiparticle operators : @xmath61 |   0^+_{qrpa } \\rangle \\\\ \\nonumber & & { \\cal b}^j_{pn , p'n ' } = \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\langle 0^+_{qrpa } | [ \\bar{a}^{\\dagger}_{(pn ) j ,-",
    "m}(-1)^m , [ \\hat{h},\\bar{a}^{\\dagger}_{(p'n ' ) j , m } ] ] |   0^+_{qrpa } \\rangle ~ , \\label{eq_abdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting matrices are independent of the angular momentum projection @xmath63 .    in rqrpa and",
    "srqrpa the nonvanishing values of @xmath64 is taken into account by using the amplitudes @xmath65 instead of the standard @xmath54 and @xmath55 , everywhere and also in the qrpa equations of motion .    by doing all of this",
    "an inconsistency appears between the bcs , with the ground state @xmath66 , and qrpa ( as well as rqrpa ) with the ground state @xmath67 . in srqrpa",
    "this inconsistency is overcome by reformulating the bcs equations .",
    "this is achieved by recalculating the @xmath68 and @xmath20 amplitudes . in srqrpa",
    "the state around which the vibrational modes occur is no longer the quasiparticle vacuum , but instead the bogoliubov transformation is chosen is such a way that provides the optimal and consistent basis while preserving the form of the phonon operator , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phonon ] ) .",
    "the modified coefficients of the bogoliubov transformation still fulfill the basic requirement that the so - called dangerous graphs , terms in the hamiltonian with only two quasiparticle creation or annihilation operators , vanish .    in practice ,",
    "the srqrpa equations are solved iteratively .",
    "one begins with the standard bcs @xmath69 amplitudes , solves the rqrpa equations of motion and calculates the factors @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath69 amplitudes are recalculated and the procedure is repeated until the selfconsistency is achieved .",
    "the srqrpa was applied initially to the evaluation of @xmath6 matrix elements in ref.@xcite and to the evaluation of @xmath1 matrix elements in ref.@xcite .",
    "numerically , the double iteration procedure represents a challenging problem . to simplify it , in refs.@xcite",
    "the bare interaction was used , and no attempt was made to fit the odd - even mass differences .",
    "in addition , no adjustment of the particle - particle coupling constant @xmath71 was made , and @xmath72 was used .",
    "consequently , the numerical values disagreed noticeably with the experiment in the @xmath6 case , and with calculations by other authors in the @xmath1 case .",
    "the numerical problems were resolved in ref.@xcite where instead of the g - matrix based interaction the pairing part ( and only that part ) of the problem was replaced by a pairing interaction that uses a constant matrix element whose value was adjusted to reproduce the experimental odd - even mass differences .",
    "this is the procedure that we adopt also here , after showing that within the qrpa the replacement of the g - matrix by a constant pairing matrix element makes little difference ( see below ) .",
    "thus , in the iterative procedure only the chemical potentials @xmath73 and @xmath74 are changed .    adopting this simplification , and using the usual requirement , as in @xcite , namely that the @xmath6 decay rate is correctly reproduced by renormalizing the coupling constant @xmath71 correspondingly , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have shown that the @xmath1 matrix elements evaluated with srqrpa agree quite well with the matrix elements of refs.@xcite .",
    "the requirement of conserving the particle number have not caused substantial changes in the value of the @xmath1 matrix elements in that case .    in table",
    "[ tab : ws ] we illustrate the problem of the particle number nonconservation within qrpa and to some extent also in rqrpa , and its restoration in srqrpa .",
    "the case of @xmath0ge @xmath2 @xmath0se is chosen , with @xmath75ca as a core , and with the @xmath76 and @xmath77 shells ( 9 single particle orbits ) for both neutrons and protons included .",
    "note that in ref.@xcite , as noted above , only the bcs occupancies were considered .",
    "we believe , contrary to the arguments there , that the effect of average particle number nonconservation in the qrpa vacuum need to be considered .",
    "using srqrpa , which does conserve the average particle number , is certainly more consistent when the problem of individual orbit occupancies is addressed .",
    "even though the conservation of the average particle number is almost restored in rqrpa and , as we will show below , the numerical values of the @xmath46 are very similar in rqrpa and srqrpa , we still prefer to use the selfconsistent method . among other things , the violation of the ikeda sum rule , which in the rqrpa is as large as 20% ,",
    "is reduced substantially ( but not eliminated completely ) when srqrpa is employed .    .",

    "the well known opposite tendencies of the pairing and broken pairs contributions is thus clearly visible .",
    "in addition , one can also see that the valence orbits @xmath91 contribute considerably more than the orbits further away from the fermi level , even though the @xmath92 and @xmath93 give nonnegligible contributions .    .",

    "such a plot , however , would be difficult to visualize since it would represent a 81@xmath9581 matrix even with our minimal space of nine orbits . instead , we consider just the three valence orbits @xmath23 ( representing both @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 and @xmath38 , and lump all the other orbits further removed from the fermi level into one combination @xmath99 ( for remote ) .",

    "when following this procedure , but otherwise keeping the same steps as in our previous evaluation of @xmath46 within qrpa , we find that for the @xmath0ge @xmath2 @xmath0se transition the matrix element is smaller by @xmath325% , reducing the previously bothersome difference with the shell model prediction noticeably .",
    "moreover , when we assume that analogous changes in the mean field should be applied also to the @xmath5se @xmath2 @xmath5kr @xmath1 decay , that differs from the @xmath0ge decay by only two additional protons and four additional neutrons , we find similar reduction in @xmath46 as well .",
