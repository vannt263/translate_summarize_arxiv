    "the statistical property of quantum mechanical particles is known in two categories , fermion and boson .",
    "the dynamics of these particles is described systematically in second - quantized field theories . in two space dimension , however , anyonic statistics @xcite is known to be possible .",
    "this observation has come not only from theoretical curiosity but also from experiment such as fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "one may even go further to define fractional statistics based on hilbert space counting independent of space dimension @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of anyon is described in the first quantized theory by introducing statistical gauge potential minimally coupled to the originally bosonic or fermionic theory .",
    "after singular gauge transformation ( to make the singular gauge transformation is meaningful , one has to apply the so - called  hard - core \" boundary condition ) , the statistical gauge potential can be removed and the wavefunction becomes multi - valued instead ( statistical transmutation ) , from which the name anyon stems .",
    "the second quantized theory of anyons is yet to come @xcite .",
    "nevetherless , one can relate chern - simons ( cs ) field theory in two space and one time dimension to the first quantized anyon theory : one can obtain the corresponding anyon equation using the second quantized field theory and heisenberg equation @xcite .",
    "the pure cs gauge action has no dynamical gauge field . by coupling the gauge field to an external source",
    ", one can investigate quantities such as wilson loops .",
    "in fact , the correlators of wilson lines in the non - abelian theory are related with the polynomial invariant of knot theory @xcite . when the gauge field is coupled to a dynamical matter field",
    ", it plays the additional role of statistical gauge potential to the matter field , which is best seen in the abelian cs theory on an infinite plane .",
    "its non - abelian statistical property is also investigated using conformal blocks @xcite .    in quantizing the cs theory ,",
    "some subtleties are noted due to the gauss constraint . by solving the constraint first and quantizing the theory later",
    ", one may lose some information inherent to the quantized theory such as quantum holonomy @xcite .",
    "in addition , restricting the hilbert space to the one with definite particle number states and treating the number operator as a @xmath3-number @xcite arouse controversies @xcite .",
    "on torus , this procedure makes the abelian cs coefficient rational which depends on the number of particles : the theory should pick up a certain coefficient to accommodate the @xmath4 particles . on the other hands",
    ", one can quantize the gauge field first and restrict the hilbert space later according to the gauss constraint ( not necessarily onto the definite particle number states ) .",
    "if one identifies the fundamental domain of the torus with a rectangular unit cell and applies the periodic ( translation ) symmetry in the both direction @xcite , then one can treat the theory field - theoretically and does not need the abelian cs coefficient quantization .    the origin of the above discrepancy ( except the quantum holonomy ) may not be entirely due to the way of gauge field quantization .",
    "one can suspect that this comes from the conflict with the symmetry that the system is allowed to have ( _ e.g. _ translation invariance and/or modular invariance ) , since the gauss constraint ( like in the presence of an external monopole source ) can not be realized arbitrarily in general due to the inherent symmetry of the compact manifold .",
    "this paper is devoted to illuminate the role of the symmetry of the compact manifold ( sphere and torus ) on the cs field theory and its connection to the anyon equation . for this purpose , we start with investigating cs theory on a sphere field - theoretically following the method given in @xcite , which is simpler than the theory on a torus since harmonic one form is absent .",

    "the expression of the constraint and hamiltonian is incorporated with the rotation symmetry , @xmath1 or @xmath0 . the hilbert space restriction due to the rotation invariance",
    "is investigated in detail .",
    "in section iv we present anyon equation for @xmath4-identical particles and for multi - species with the vanishing total charge . the boundary condition for the wavefunction with the rotation symmetry taken care of . in section v we introduce an external magetic monopole source and discuss its ground state and degeneracy .",
    "it is noted that the ground state solution of anyons is not annihilated by the ladder operator of @xmath5 unlike for the monopole harmonics .",
    "section vi is the summary and discussion , where we discuss about the translation and modular symmetry on the torus and its consequences .",
    "the gauge field on a sphere is a singular function in general ( connection on a @xmath6-bundle ) .",
    "therefore , one needs coordinate patches to describe the gauge field on the whole space @xcite .",
    "we introduce two coordinate patches , which are two projected planes from the south and north poles respectively ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) .",
