    "x - ray disk winds from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are revealing new facets of compact object accretion .",
    "for instance , winds carry away a significant fraction of the mass that is accreted onto the compact object .",
    "estimates range from a few percent of the mass accretion rate in the the inner disk , to several times the inflow rate ( see , e.g. , king et al .",
    "this means that mass transfer even in lmxbs may be highly non - conservative in the very phase when the mass transfer rate is expected to be highest .",
    "this impacts binary evolution models , and numerous specific predictions , including e.g. the spin evolution of compact objects in lmxbs ( for a review of spins , see miller & miller 2014 ; for a review of black hole x - ray binaries , see remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; also see fragos & mcclintock 2015 ) .",
    "winds in stellar - mass black holes , in particular , may provide insights into x - ray `` warm absorbers '' and faster outflows from seyfert-1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and quasars .",
    "instrumental sensitivity curves and intrinsic spectral shapes make the study of _ low - ionization _ gas in warm absorbers relatively easy .",
    "this readily - detected gas could arise via irradiation of the `` torus '' ( e.g. kriss et al .",
    "1996 ; also see lee et al .",
    "2001 ) ; it may not directly probe the physics of the inner accretion disk .",
    "however , highly ionized components with potentially different origins have emerged in deep exposures .",
    "the chandra / hetg spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , for instance , contains strong fe xxv and fe xxvi ( he - like and h - like ) absorption lines .",
    "they are blue - shifted by @xmath3   km / s , require a column of @xmath4 , and imply a kinetic power that is about 10% of the radiative luminosity ( young et al .",
    "the inferred launching radius is @xmath5 , putting this component within or interior to the broad ( emission ) line region ( blr ) .",
    "these wind properties are remarkably similar to those measured in , e.g. , gro j1655@xmath040 ( miller et al .  2006 , 2008 ;",
    "kallman et al .",
    "2009 ; neilsen & homan 2012 ) .",
    "connections like this may underlie emerging relationships between the kinetic power of winds and accretion power , that span the black hole mass scale ( king et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "most importantly , perhaps , disk winds may reveal the fundamental physics of disk accretion , making contact with simulations in a way that continuum emission from the disk can not .",
    "studies have shown that disk winds and jets in x - ray binaries are anti - correlated ( miller et al .  2006b , 2008",
    "; neilsen & lee 2009 ; king et al .",
    "2012 , ponti et al .  2012 ) .",
    "there is actual evidence of absence : jets are truly quenched in disk  dominated soft states ( russell et al .",
    "2010 ) , and winds are not absent owing only to ionization effects ( miller et al .",
    "viable explanations for this dichotomy include changes in the inner accretion disk ( perhaps related to the onset of an advection - dominated accretion flow ) , and/or changes in dominant magnetic field component above the disk ( e.g. poloidal or toroidal ) .",
    "more directly , some winds may be powered by magnetic forces , which points to the underlying role of magnetic fields in mediating mass and angular momentum transfer within the disk ( miller et al .  2006a , 2008 ) .",
    "constraints on wind launching radii are central to understanding how the winds are driven , and how much mass and power they carry .",
    "this requires photoionization modeling of the absorbing gas . in most cases ,",
    "the gas density is not known , and radii must be deduced via @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the ionizing luminosity , @xmath8 is the launching radius , @xmath9 is the equivalent hydrogen column density , and @xmath10 is the ionization parameter ) .",
    "this assumes that @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 , and in this sense it is an upper limit . in rare cases , the gas density can be measured directly , and wind radii can be derived from @xmath13 . in the black hole gro j1655@xmath040 ,",
    "the ratio of fe xxii lines at 11.87     and 11.92     gives a density of @xmath14 .",
    "( miller et al .  2006a , 2008 ) .",
    "in the black hole candidate maxi j1305@xmath0704 , these line ratios imply a density of @xmath15 ( though that wind may not escape the system ; miller et al .",
    "it is likely reasonable to assume that other winds with numerous similarities to e.g. gro j1655@xmath040 may be equally dense , but high line - of - sight column densities have prevented the detection of fe l - shell lines in prominent sources including 4u 1630@xmath0472 , h  1743@xmath0322 , and grs 1915@xmath1105 .",
    "recent studies of a large population point toward an accretion disk wind origin for the blr in agn ( tremaine et al .",
    "2014 ) . assuming that keplerian velocities dominate the width of these optical and uv lines , radii of @xmath16 are obtained .",
    "this range is commensurate with wind radii inferred in stellar - mass black holes , again pointing to a connection .",
    "however , disk winds in black hole x - ray binaries have not previously been detected in emission , preventing a similar dynamical constraint on the launching radius .",
    "this complicates most attempts to understand the wind driving mechanism and the total mass outflow rate , and hampers a clear association with stellar - mass disk winds and the broad line region .",
    "the best disk wind spectra have been modeled in an approximate fashion .",
    "some analyses have attempted a line - by - line treatment with gaussian absorption functions ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2006b , kubota et al .",
    "2007 , neilsen & lee 2009 , ueda et al .",
    "other efforts have made use of single - zone absorption models generated with , e.g. , xstar ( e.g. kallman & bautista 2001 ; kallman et al .",
    "2009 ) or cloudy ( e.g. ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) . while this procedure is far more physically self - consistent than line - by - line fitting , and",
    "while it has likely captured the broad characteristics of disk winds correctly , it has not yielded statistically acceptable fits .",
    "it is likely that the spectra contain additional information that has yet to be exploited .",
    "importantly , only one prior effort has included re - emission from the wind ( see miller et al .",
    "2014 , concerning maxi j1305@xmath0704 ) , which must occur whenever there is absorption .    in this work , we re - examine the best disk wind absorption spectra from _",
    "chandra_/hetg observations of stellar - mass black holes .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the fe k band , wherein the most highly ionized gas  likely originating closest to the black hole ",
    "is contained .",
    "if stellar - mass black hole outflows are similar to seyfert warm absorbers , then this range also carries the bulk of the mass flux ( crenshaw & kraemer 2012 ) . in order to best understand the atomic and velocity structures present in the first - order heg spectra",
    ", we also consider the third - order spectra , which deliver three times higher spectral resolution . indeed , the third - order spectra are only a factor of a few lower in resolution than anticipated spectra from _ astro - h _",
    "( takahashi et al .  2010 , 2014 ) .",
    "we employ a new version of the xstar photoionization package to model both first- and third - order data ; its spectral resolution is 20 times higher than prior versions , and it includes updated atomic data important to the fe k band .",
    "last , we allow for ( re-)emission from the wind , with gas parameters closely tied to corresponding absorption properties .",
    "we require observations with extremely high sensitivity in the fe k band in first - order hetg spectra ; this also ensures the best possible sensitivity in third - order spectra .",
    "however , for a combination of astrophysical and pragmatic reasons , hetg observations of stellar - mass black holes with strong signatures of disk winds are relatively rare .",
    "disk winds appear to be equatorial ( miller et al .",
    "2006a , b ; king et al .  2012 ; also see ponti et al .",
    "2012 ) , reducing the number of sources in which these outflows can be observed .",
    "cygnus x-1 has been observed extensively with the hetg , and it displays a complex absorption spectrum ( see , e.g. , schulz et al .",
    "2002 ) ; however , this source and other high - mass x - ray binaries are not considered as the massive companion wind contaminates any signatures of a disk wind .",
    "cir x-1 was also omitted from consideration because its wind features ( brandt & schulz 2000 ) are plausibly tied to its companion .",
    "igr j17091@xmath03624 displayed a particularly fast and powerful disk wind ( e.g. king et al .",
    "2012 ) , but its low flux does not permit a deeper analysis .",
    "modest sensitivity is also a general feature of neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ; in the best cases , blue - shifted absorption is sometimes detected ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2004 , miller et al .",
    "2011 ) , but blue - shifts are tentative in other sources and spectra ( e.g. 4u 1624@xmath0490 ; see xiang et al .",
    "the hetg spectra of maxi j1305@xmath0704 contain strong wind absorption features and even re - emission at long wavelengths ( miller et al .",
    "2014 ) , but the observation did not deliver reliable high - resolution spectra in the fe k region owing to a pointing offset .",
    "the set of high - inclination black holes with very high flux levels and multiple observations of disk winds is limited to four sources : 4u 1630@xmath0472 , gro j1655@xmath040 , h  1743@xmath0322 , and grs 1915@xmath1105 .",
    "even among these , not every spectrum has excellent sensitivity .",
    "we selected the observation of each source wherein the lines were best defined ( e.g. where the fe xxv and fe xxvi line fluxes divided by their respective errors is maximal ; this is distinct from the highest column density , which would still give lines with large errors at low flux or in a short expsoure ) . for gro j1655@xmath040 ,",
    "h  1743@xmath0322 , and grs 1915@xmath1105 this was possible using published measurements ( e.g. miller et al .",

    "this signals that a single absorbing zone is not an adequate description of the spectrum .",
    "indeed , within miller et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , it is noted that the observed fe xxv and fe xxvi lines can not arise in exactly the same gas .",
    "a combination of zones with different ionizations and velocities can certainly create this disparity , however .",
    "the shifts measured via single gaussian models for the fe xxv and fe xxvi lines in the selected observation of grs 1915@xmath1105 are also inconsistent ( see ueda et al .",
    "the fe xxv line shows a red - shift , possibly indicating a contribution from the intercombination line .",
    "in contrast , the fe xxvi line shows a blue - shift .",
    "this also signals a need for multiple velocity components .    at the time of writing , the selected spectrum of 4u",

    "however , it is included in a study that finds no evidence of jet - based emission lines in this source ( neilsen et al .",
    "2014 ; also see diaz - trigo et al .",
    "all _ chandra_-specific data reduction and processing tasks were performed using ciao version 4.6 , and corresponding calibration files .",
    "since the heg has more collecting area than the meg in the fe k band , we have only made use of heg spectra in this work .",

    "complete higher - order data are not provided through the `` tgcat '' facility , so full obserations were obtained from the _ chandra _ archive .",
    "calibrated spectral files are provided through the archive , but response files must be generated by the user .",
    "response files for the third - order redistribution matrix files were generated using the tool `` mkgrmf '' , and these files were then used to help construct ancillary response files using `` fullgarf '' .    in order to achieve the best possible sensitivity , the ciao tool `` add_grating_orders '' was used to combine opposing grating orders into a single spectrum .",

    "the gratings redistribution matrix files are effectively the same for opposing orders .",
    "we have relied on the heg third - order data , as it provides the highest possible spectral resolution .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the heg second - order provides spectral resolution that is twice as high as that available in first - order spectra .",
    "depending on the sensitivity of the data , that resolution is only on the edge of being able to separate the components of the fe xxvi @xmath20 line , for instance .",
    "future work on these and other sources can make use of the heg second - order spectra .",
    "in contrast , the meg second - order spectra are suppressed in the hetg , in order to facilitate order sorting .",
    "all of the observations considered in this work were obtained by running the acis - s array in `` continuous clocking '' mode , in order to prevent photon pile - up . in this mode ,",
    "imaging information along the narrow axis of the array is sacrificed in order to reduce the frame time from 3.2  s to just 2.85  ms .",
    "since the acis chips are medium - resolution spectrometers , accurate order sorting can still be achieved despite the loss of imaging information .",
    "the zeroth order image lands on the s3 chip , and a sufficiently high incident flux would cause frames from this chip to drop from the telemetry stream . in each of the observations , then , a `` gray '' filter was applied around the zeroth order position , so that only one in 10 or one in 20 incident zeroth order photons is recorded .",
    "this enables tracking of the aimpoint and the construction of the wavelength grid in the dispersed spectra , while preventing frame loss .",
    "this mode is capable of handling incredibly bright sources without suffering photon pile - up .",

    "it was previously noted that the absence of strong , narrow emission lines indicates that the disk winds in these high inclination sources must be equatorial : if the gas were distributed in a more spherical manner , gas above the line of sight would contribute _ prominent _ emission ( miller et al .",

    "this range acknowledges plausible uncertainties while demanding a minimum contribution from the emission component .",
    "basic assumptions about the gas geometry further informed the manner in which the spectral models were constructed .",
    "the absorption lines are clearly blue - shifted ; else they could not be described as disk winds .",
    "the photoionized absorption components were therefore bounded from below to have either zero velocity shift , or a blue shift .",
    "the photoionized emission lines are likely come from the full cylinder in which the disk wind arises ; in this case , velocities should cancel and the emission should have zero net velocity shift ( but a significant velocity width ) . if the far side of the cylinder ( with respect to the central engine ) contributes preferentially for any reason , the emission would have a net red - shift .",
    "figures 1 and 3 suggest that any emission is strongest to the red of the ( blue - shifted ) absorption components . based on these expectations , we bounded the emission components to have a red - shift between zero and the absolute value of the observed blue - shift in the same component ( e.g. @xmath43 ) .",
    "note that when these conditions were relaxed , emission components were not found to be blue - shifted , and absorption components were not found to be red - shifted .",
    "rather , this step merely permitted a degree of simplicity in constructing models .",
    "a particular detail of the photoionization model implementation had to be determined via numerous fitting experiments .",
    "a priori , it is not clear if the photoionized emission spectrum from points around the wind cylinder might also be affected by local or ambient wind absorption .",
    "numerous trials revealed that vastly improved fits are obtained when the emission spectrum is not obscured .",
    "last , we allowed for a narrow gaussian emission line at 6.4  kev , consistent with emission from neutral or nearly - neutral fe , to describe any remaining illumination of distant or ambient cold gas .",
    "reflection from the outer disk , for instance , might be one means by which such a feature could be generated .",

    "if this is correct , then emission should be seen from the disk wind in sources that are viewed at low or moderate angles , and any absorption should be very weak . to test this , we examined archival hetg spectra of gx 339@xmath04 and xte j1817@xmath0330 in disk  dominated high / soft states .",

    "moderately complex x - ray absorption spectra have previously been detected in gx 339@xmath04 ; however , the observed lines do not vary with the continuum , and it is likely that such lines originate in the ism ( see , e.g. , juett et al .  2006 , pinto et al .",

    "the prime difficulty with this test is that gx 339@xmath04 and xte j1817@xmath0330 are _ very _ soft in the high / soft state , delivering little sensitivity in the fe k band compared to 4u 1630@xmath0472 , gro j1655@xmath040 , h  1743@xmath0322 , and grs 1915@xmath1105 . the spectra appear to generally lack the signal required to confirm or reject emission from a disk wind .",

    "the detection of multiple components in each spectrum  some with much higher outflow speeds than identified before  has served to increase the mass outflow rate and kinetic power for the winds in each systems over prior estimates ( see table 12 ; also see king et al .",
    "apart from the small launching radii now implied by two aspects of our modeling , the larger outflow rates also point to the need for magnetic processes  not just thermal driving  to expel the winds ( miller et al .",
