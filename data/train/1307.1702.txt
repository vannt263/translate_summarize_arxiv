    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are the most massive and most homogeneous class of galaxy observed in the universe .",
    "their large stellar luminosities and unique position at the centres of galaxy clusters make them easily identified from cluster surveys and observed out to high redshift . occupying the dense regions in cluster cores , the formation of bcgs",
    "can be explained by dynamical friction induced major merging ( white 1976 ; ostriker & hausman 1977 ) .",
    "the same general picture subsequently emerges from simulations which show that bcgs could form through dissipationless merging of similar - mass systems ( e.g. dubinski , mihos & hernquist , 1999 ) .",
    "more generally , work on elliptical galaxies from semi - analytic simulations indicates that they originate from an early period of rapid star formation and major merging at @xmath4 with subsequent mass assembly becoming dominated by non - dissipative ( dry ) minor merging ( e.g. khochfar & silk 2006 )  a conclusion which fits reasonably well with the `` downsizing '' behaviour results from deep optical / ir surveys ( e.g. cirasuolo et al .",
    "2010 ) . since bcgs are formed in the first density peaks to collapse their evolution is easily followed in large @xmath5cdm cosmological simulations of structure formation .",
    "based on the semi - analytic modelling of the dark matter millennium simulation , for example , de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) predict that bcgs have only @xmath6 of their stellar mass assembled by @xmath2 and should be undergoing many mergers between @xmath7 , approximately quadrupling in stellar mass over this time period .",
    "the recent simulations of laporte et al .",
    "( 2013 ) predict a somewhat smaller stellar mass growth for bcgs by both major and minor mergers , with mass growth of a factor of 1.9 during the time between @xmath8 and a further factor of 1.5 since @xmath9 .",
    "observational studies of the merging rates in the centres of clusters concentrate on samples at low redshift , concluding that major mergers of bcgs are a rare occurrence and reporting a dominance of small companion galaxies close to the bcgs in cluster cores ( edwards & patton , 2012 ; liu et al . , 2009 ; mcintosh et al . 2008 ) . however , other authors point out that bcgs at low redshift continue to grow from major merging ( e.g. brough et al .",
    "2011 ) .    the close relationship between the complex intracluster environment and the central bcg is well established ( e.g. edge 1991 ; collins & mann 1998 ; brough et al .",
    "2005 ; stott 2008 , 2012 ) . but",
    "despite the obvious consequence of bcg growth in mass via the merging processes in the centres of clusters , observationally the problem remains a vexing issue .",
    "the claim by aragn - salamanca , baugh & kauffmann ( 1998 ) of evolution in the stellar mass using the observed near - ir brightness of bcgs was shown to result from optical selection bias ( burke , collins & mann , 2000 ) .",
    "subsequent work indicated little evolution of bcg stellar mass in both optically selected clusters out to @xmath10 ( whiley et al .",
    "2008 ) and also for bcgs based on x - ray cluster selection reaching to @xmath11 ( collins et al .",
    "2009 , stott et al .",
    "the evolution measured for the bcgs in x - ray clusters as far back as @xmath2 is surprisingly small , with these systems already having of @xmath12 of their final mass and @xmath13 of their final scale - size ( stott et al .",
    "2011 ) compared to their present day counterparts . on the other hand lidman",
    "( 2012 ) claim to measure a stellar mass growth of a factor of 1.8 over the same epoch based on 12 bcgs from the spitzer - based sparcs survey .",
    "this result is significantly different from the x - ray based clusters despite the substantial overlap in redshift of the samples , and while the sparcs bcg data are still a factor 1.5 heavier than the predicted masses of de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) they are in better agreement with the bcg growth rates from the most recent simulations ( laporte et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "independently of these considerations , it is becoming increasingly clear that to make any meaningful comparison between observed and predicted bcg evolution it is essential to take into account the stellar mass growth of the diffuse intracluster light ( icl ) which extends well beyond the stellar profile of the bcg in most cases but remains almost degenerate with the underlying surface brightness profile of the bcg in the inner @xmath14kpc . at low redshift both observations",
    "( e.g. gonzalez , zaritsky & zabludoff , 2005 , 2007 ; zibetti et al . , 2005 ; toledo et al . , 2011 ) and simulations ( conroy et al . , 2007 )",
    "find that the light from the icl and bcg combined contributes somewhere between @xmath15 of the total cluster starlight , with the individual icl contribution similar to or even dominating ( up to @xmath16 ) the contribution from the bcg .",
    "furthermore the results of burke et al . (",
    "2012 ) show that whatever may be happening to the bcg as a result of mergers , the icl component is built up relatively recently , increasing by as much as a factor 4 between @xmath3 and the present .",
    "we return to this issue later in the paper .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of bcg assembly using @xmath17 ` snapshots ' to estimate the instantaneous number of major and minor mergers onto bcgs from a sample of 14 high - redshift x - ray luminous clusters , and then compare our results to those of low redshift studies and simulations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  [ data_s ] contains the details of the sample studied ; in section  [ method_s ] the methods and corrections used are described ; in section  [ results_s ] the numbers of bcg companions and the mass increases from their accretion are presented ; the results are discussed in section  [ discussion ] and conclusions drawn in section  [ conc_s ] . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath18 = 70 km s@xmath19mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 = 0.3 , @xmath21 = 0.7 .",
    "we construct a sample of 14 x - ray selected galaxy clusters at @xmath0 , all of which have @xmath22-band imaging data from _",
    "hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ or _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2)_. the high spatial resolution of the @xmath17 enables bcg companions and galaxy separations to be resolved to a few kpc at @xmath3 .",
    "the majority of the sample is drawn from that of stott et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which are all x - ray selected clusters , and was supplemented with 2 additional x - ray luminous clusters in the same redshift range ( rcs j2319.9 + 0038 , gilbank et al . , 2008 ; and rx j1716.4 + 6708 , gioia et al . , 1999 ) with similar @xmath17 @xmath22-band data .",
    "the clusters in the sample have images taken with either the f850lp or f814w filter , both of which correspond to observed frame @xmath22-band or rest frame @xmath23-band at the redshift of our sample .",
    "the data are downloaded from the @xmath17 archive in pre - reduced form .",
    "the details of the clusters in this sample are shown in table  [ clusters ] and figure  [ bcgs_50kpc ] shows the central 100kpc region surrounding all 14 clusters .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ mass_frac_tab ]      edwards & patton ( 2012 ) study a sample of 91 bcgs at @xmath24 in clusters of masses @xmath25 with imaging in the @xmath26-band and carry out a similar analysis to that described here , counting companions within 30 and 50kpc apertures and using a control sample of ellipticals of similar brightness to estimate contamination . using similar dynamical friction arguments they calculate the dynamical merging timescales for the companions in the same manner as described here and conclude that for a 50  kpc aperture @xmath270.14 before background correction and @xmath28 after correcting .",
    "these are somewhat smaller than our values reported here , namely @xmath291.14 and 6.45@xmath301.15 respectively .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath31 values is shown in figure  [ ep_comp ] .",
    "this figure highlights the excess of companion galaxies to bcgs at @xmath3 , with each mass ratio bin containing more than twice the number of companions compared to @xmath9 .",
    "sample presented here is shown in black , the results of edwards & patton at @xmath32 are shown in red and the predictions from the simulations of laporte et al .",
    "( 2013 ) at @xmath33 are shown in blue .",
    "the magnitude gaps of -0.75 , -1.75 , -2.5 and -3.25 correspond to luminosity ratios of 1:2 , 1:5 , 1:10 and 1:20 respectively.,width=302 ]    in a similar way to the results presented here , edwards & patton find there are a greater number of companions with larger luminosity ratios ( 20:1 ) than smaller luminosity ratios ( 2:1 ) at @xmath9 and in fact find companions of luminosity ratio of 2:1 or smaller to be rare .",
    "this leads them to emphasise the role of minor merging in the build up bcgs since @xmath9 with an estimate that the masses of bcgs increase by @xmath3410% between @xmath9 and @xmath35 from the accretion of their companions .",
    "other observational studies reach similar conclusions : liu et al ( 2009 ) examine 515 bcgs at @xmath36 and find @xmath37 for companions with luminosity ratios less than 1:4 and within 30 kpc of the bcg .",
    "liu et al . also find 18/515 of their bcgs to be undergoing major mergers and suggest that bcgs should have increased their masses by 15% from major dry mergers since @xmath38 .",
    "mcintosh et al . (",
    "2008 ) study a sample of bcgs at @xmath39 and find only 38/845 to be undergoing major mergers ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "they predict that massive haloes are growing by @xmath41 per gyr by major mergers . our high redshift sample on the other hand shows larger total luminosities for the 2:1 companions than the 20:1 sample , indicating that major merging is more important for the stellar mass buildup of high redshift bcgs than nearby bcgs .    in summary , results from the literature",
    "find a significantly lower number of bcg companion galaxies in low redshift clusters than are observed here for higher redshift systems .",
    "of course the dynamical timescale argument in section  [ timescale ] provides a plausible explanation for this behaviour ; table  [ tf_tab ] indicates that all of the bcg companions within 50 kpc and with mass ratios less than 20:1 should have been accreted by the bcg in the 3.4 gyr between @xmath10 and @xmath9 and this is consistent with the relatively low numbers of companions found in the @xmath42 studies .",
    "laporte et al . ( 2013 ) simulate the evolution of bcgs through their merging history using dark matter haloes initially extracted from the millennium simulation ( springel , 2005 ) and re - simulated using a zoom - in method developed by gao et al .",
    "they populate the dark matter haloes with stellar particles which are distributed to match the scale - sizes observed for quiescent galaxies at @xmath33 and run their simulation from @xmath43 .",
    "the number of companions at each luminosity ratio is compared with our data in figure  [ ep_comp ] .",
    "on average the predicted instantaneous merger rate over the mass ratios 1:12 ; 1:35 ; 1:10100 at @xmath33 are a factor 1.5 larger than our observations in the same ratio bins , however our sample has an upper limit of @xmath44 in redshift .",
    "although we have no real observational constraint on how the merger rates change with time between @xmath45 and the uncertainties are large , it is noteworthy that the implied number of mergers during the cosmic time between @xmath46 is consistent with the major merger rate ( @xmath47gyr@xmath19 ) predicted for the most massive galaxies in @xmath48 simulations ( see hopkins et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "turning to the bcg stellar mass growth , the laporte et al .",
    "( 2013 ) simulations predict stellar mass growth factors of 1.5 ( @xmath49 ) ; 1.9 ( @xmath50 ) ; 2.6 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "their simulated cluster and bcg masses at @xmath3 are shown in comparison with those of the clusters and bcgs in our sample in figure  [ mass_comp ] . from this figure",
    "it can clearly be seen that there is good overlap between the simulations and our observed clusters , reinforcing a valid comparison between the samples .",
    "their predicted mass increase of 1.9 between @xmath50 agrees well with the mass increase measured here under the reasonable assumption ( already demonstrated ) that all our companions merge by @xmath9 . however",
    "a mass increase factor of 2.6 between @xmath52 is outside of the errors on the mass increase found here ( @xmath53 = 1.83 @xmath30 0.43 ) .",
    "this appears to be a problem for the mass increase factor of 1.5 predicted for @xmath54 as the low redshift studies discussed in section  [ comparison ] estimate the growth to be at the 10% level over a similar redshift range .",
    "the results of laporte et al .",
    ", however , show improved agreement with observations of bcg mass growth at larger redshift over the simulations of de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) , who predict an increase of @xmath55 times in mass for bcgs since @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is clear from figure  [ mass_comp ] that the problem for simulations of large bcg masses at high redshift is still apparent .      the estimated number of mergers since @xmath3 has direct bearing on the question of whether bcgs have evolved in mass over the same period . as mentioned in the introduction , the mass growth of bcgs measured by some authors since @xmath3 is negligible , whereas others find significant evolution .",
    "the growth factor via mergers of @xmath56 reported here is consistent with the stellar mass growth estimate of 1.8 for bcgs between @xmath57 reported by lidman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) but somewhat contradictory to collins et al ( 2009 ) who find 90% of bcg stellar masses in place by @xmath58 , and stott et al ( 2010 ) who find bcgs at @xmath3 on average have 95% of the stellar mass of those measured locally ; both these studies use cluster a sample which largely overlaps with that used here .",
    "if we believe the lower bcg mass growth estimates then it is necessary to ask whether accreted mass from companions ends up in the extended cd halos or as part of the icl surrounding the bcgs , rather than merging centrally onto the bcg itself .",
    "burke et al . ( 2012 ) show that the icl contains @xmath344% of the total cluster light at @xmath3 , a fraction which increases to as much as 40% in clusters nearby ( rudick , mihos & mcbride 2006 , 2011 ; gonzalez et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore burke et al .",
    "( 2012 ) estimate that on average the icl contributes more ( observed frame ) @xmath59-band light than the combined stellar emission within a 50  kpc radius of their bcgs at @xmath2 ( see their table 3 ) ; providing strong evidence for substantial amounts of light at large radii .",
    "laporte et al .",
    "( 2013 ) do discuss the stripping of galaxies and the amount of mass from mergers which ends up in the diffuse component surrounding the bcg .",
    "from their simulations they find between @xmath60 of the total merging mass ends up as a `` diffuse '' stripped component .",
    "this suggests a scenario where the smallest companion galaxies , which have the longest merging timescales , have their stellar mass slowly stripped as a result of their slow spiral onto the bcg .",
    "the drawn - out merger times means that there is ample opportunity for the stars in these small galaxies to be stripped and form the diffuse intracluster light .",
    "however , the fraction of the stripped material estimated by laporte et al .",
    "( 2013 ) is smaller than typical estimates of the icl fraction and there is not enough mass in the companions less than 1/20 of the bcg mass measured in this study ( but excluded from our analysis ) to account for the large icl fractions observed in nearby clusters ( e.g. , mihos et al . , 2005 ;",
    "rudick et al . , 2006 ; gonzalez et al .",
    ", 2005 ; 2007 ; krick et al . , 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , the high resolution n - body simulations of conroy et al . ( 2007 ) and puchwien et al .",
    "( 2010 ) predict that @xmath61 of the matter accreted onto bcgs from mergers should eventually end up distributed in icl in order to reproduce the distribution observed in nearby clusters .",
    "furthermore , the simulations of murante et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that 50% of the light in the icl at the present day should have been formed through interactions of cluster galaxies with the bcg .",
    "the simulations of the icl by rudick et al .",
    "( 2011 ) predict a fairly steady buildup of the icl between @xmath62 ( see figure  4 of rudick et al . , 2011 ) ,",
    "increasing to anything between @xmath63 of the total cluster light by today .    therefore it may reasonably be expected that a smaller fraction of the accreted mass from companion galaxies than is predicted by laporte et al . and measured in this paper , contributes to the bcg mass growth , with the majority of accreted mass eventually residing in the icl . in this case , the bcg mass increase from accreted companions reduces from a factor 1.8 ( i.e. mass growth of 180% ) to more like @xmath64 ( i.e. mass growth of 50%90% ) , while the icl sees a many fold increase in its stellar content between @xmath7 .",
    "more detailed simulations of the bcg + icl growth at @xmath3 would help to clarify these issues as would more observational work using homogeneously selected cluster samples in the redshift range between @xmath65 and at redshifts higher than @xmath66 .    finally , one potential caveat to the bcg evolution work is that the mass estimation from observational measurement almost always assumes that light observed in near - ir wavebands traces stellar mass . in their simulation of bcg mass assembly ,",
    "tonini et al .",
    "( 2012 ) predict that the use of updated stellar population synthesis models with more detailed treatment of the agb component can provide reconciliation between the observed no - evolution results and predicted masses of bcgs from simulations . despite the large scatter in the predictions ,",
    "this claim should be testable via the optical to near - ir colours of bcgs at @xmath67 .",
    "in this paper we examine the numbers of mergers for 14 bcgs in the redshift range @xmath68 using @xmath17 images by counting the number of companions to bcgs within 50  kpc apertures to a consistent magnitude limit . based on these snapshot measurements , bcgs over this redshift range exhibit a wide range of merging activity with an average @xmath69 companions between luminosity or mass ratios 1:11:20 after background correction ; a number which is significantly larger than similar studies of bcgs at @xmath70 .",
    "the calculated short merging timescales of the companion galaxies provides an explanation for the smaller number of companions at low redshift and suggests that the majority of the bcg companions at @xmath3 are accreted by @xmath9 .",
    "we also estimate the mass growth of the bcgs resulting from the accretion of its companions .",
    "we find that major and minor mergers contribute in about equal measure to the mass build of bcgs since @xmath3 .",
    "the factor by which bcgs are estimated to grow in stellar mass from the accretion of their companions since @xmath3 is @xmath71 , which is close to the predictions of recent simulations of bcg merger history .",
    "if material becomes stripped adding to the build up of the icl rather than merging onto to bcg over the same period then the real growth of bcgs from mergers could be substantially smaller .",

    "<S> hierarchical assembly within clusters of galaxies is tied directly to the evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , which dominate the stellar light in the centres of rich clusters . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the number of mergers onto bcgs in 14 x - ray selected clusters over the redshift range @xmath0 using hst imaging data . </S>",
    "<S> we find significant differences in the numbers of companion galaxies to bcgs between the clusters in our sample indicating that bcgs in similar mass clusters can have very different merging histories . within a 50  kpc radius around the bcgs </S>",
    "<S> we find an average of @xmath1 companion galaxies with mass ratios ( companion : bcg ) between 1:1 and 1:20 . </S>",
    "<S> the infalling companions show a 50/50 split between major ( 1:1 - 1:2 ) and minor ( 1:31:20 ) mergers . when compared to similar work using lower redshift clusters , </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that both major and minor merging was more common in the past . </S>",
    "<S> since the dynamical timescales for merging onto the bcg are relatively short compared with the look - back time to @xmath2 our results suggest that the bcg stellar mass may increase by as much as 1.8 times since @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . however the growth rate of bcgs will be substantially less if stripped material from nearby companions ends up in the diffuse intracluster light .    </S>",
