    "statistical analyses of large samples of galaxies belonging to rich galaxy clusters reveal a gradual trend of the quenching of star formation in galaxies at decreasing radial distance from the centres of clusters .",
    "this is generally interpreted as the overwhelming influence of the gravitational field of the dark matter associated with the cluster , added to the effect of the hot gas in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , that serves to progressively deprive the galaxies of the fuel for star formation through tidal and other stripping processes .",
    "thus , the core of a cluster is generally thought to be the site of the most dramatic transformation in the evolution of a galaxy . as a result ,",
    "the central regions of galaxy clusters end up being dominated by passively evolving red elliptical / lenticular galaxies , while their blue star - forming counterparts prefer the sparsely occupied regions away from clusters .",
    "however , over the last few years , a growing number of galaxies , with an unusually high rate of star formation , have been discovered on the outskirts of rich galaxy clusters .",
    "these galaxies , often spotted close to or outside the virial radius of clusters , are seen to possess tidal features , and signs of morphological distortions that appear to be induced by close interactions .",
    "a majority of these galaxies have been discovered beyond a redshift of @xmath10 @xcite , since at these redshifts , the regions beyond the virial boundaries of clusters often fit on to current wide - format imagers .",
    "good examples of these are the infalling galaxy c153 in abell  2125 ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which exhibits comet - like tails of x - ray emitting gas , or the flagrantly star - forming galaxies on the outskirts of abell  2744 ( @xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , where enhanced star formation is detected in a string of early - type dwarfs outside the virial radius .",
    "it is not yet known whether such galaxies are common at lower redshifts , since surveys away from the cores of nearby clusters are not common .",
    "infalling galaxies like ngc  4472 , at 1.2  mpc from the core of the virgo cluster ( @xmath13 ) , show evidence of extended streams of hot x - ray emitting gas , and a shock front in the x - ray observation @xcite .",
    "this is accompanied by star formation in tidal streams of stripped cold gas from its dwarf companion ugc  7636 @xcite .",
    "similar systems are seen elsewhere in virgo @xcite , and in abell  3627 ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the abundance of h@xmath15 and hii emission indicate rapid star formation .",
    "some of these galaxies are plunging towards the cluster core on their own , while others like those comprising j0454 ( @xmath16 ) are merging with the cluster as a galaxy group @xcite . in the absence of systematic studies ,",
    "it is not clear how common such starburst galaxies are away from the cores of clusters , and indeed how important this phenomenon is in the grand scheme of galaxy evolution .",
    "one would like to know , for instance , whether their occurrence is related to the properties of the clusters , the structure of the surrounding cosmic web or the properties of the galaxies themselves .",
    "earlier studies have suggested that evolution of galaxies in clusters is mainly driven by processes such as ram - pressure stripping , where a galaxy falling into cluster loses its gas content through interactions with the hot icm , thus being deprived of star formation by the time it reaches the cluster core .",
    "major mergers between galaxies are uncommon even in cluster cores @xcite , and galaxy - galaxy interactions @xcite are in general thought to be unimportant in cosmological models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the observed radial gradient in star formation and other galaxy properties ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "it has been shown elsewhere that filaments of galaxies @xcite and outskirts of clusters @xcite are such favourable sites .",

    "thus , one of the most crucial links required to fully understand galaxy evolution is to find how do the galaxies in cluster cores become passive while those in the field remain star - forming .",

    "the local conditions on the outskirts of clusters , i.e. small relative velocities between pairs of galaxies , and higher galaxy density with respect to the field , seem to favour interactions among galaxies , and may lead to the observed enhancement in the sfr of galaxies in these regions .",

    "these observations are currently very difficult , and with no advanced x - ray observatory in the horizon , indirect ways of understanding the role of filaments in the evolution of cosmos , by studying the effect of the filamentary environment on the galaxies are necessary @xcite .    by employing semi - analytic modelling",
    ", @xcite showed that galaxies with similar local density but different ` global ' environment ( different positions on the cosmic web ) , have subtle but non - negligible differences in their sfr and colours .",
    "they attribute this result to the coherent motion of galaxies approaching the clusters through large - scale filaments @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed an interesting scenario , whereby galaxies in a small galaxy group crossing a cluster may be pulled towards each other , thus increasing the local galaxy density by an order of magnitude , and the probability of galaxy - galaxy interactions by about a factor of 100 ( density squared ) .",
    "[ d3 ] provides some evidence in support of this scenario ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for galaxies at @xmath89 from the cluster centre ,",
    "the mean projected distance to the three nearest neighbours within @xmath90 km s@xmath5 of the starburst galaxies is @xmath91  mpc in 78% of the cases .",
    "however , for all other cluster galaxies in the same radial range , this is true only about 66% of the time , suggesting that at a given cluster - centric distance , starburst galaxies are more likely to be in a relatively denser environment .",
    "this is worth verifying in larger samples as they become available .",
    "type  i ( straight ) filaments exist between close ( @xmath92 5 - 10 mpc ) cluster pairs @xcite .",
    "however , the majority ( @xmath93 50% ) of the filaments in the cosmic web are of type  ii ( warped ) .",
    "some attempts have also been made to understand the density profile of type  i filaments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see edwards et al .",
    "their relatively shorter length @xcite and higher matter density may imply that the probability of galaxy - galaxy interactions occurring amongst galaxies on these filaments is higher than on their counterparts .",
    "[ type ] favours this scenario .",
    "it shows that @xmath94 of the ( morphologically classifiable ) filaments feeding the comparison ( cn ) clusters are of type  i ( straight ) , as compared to @xmath4647% in the sb clusters .",
    "this is also in sync with the results of @xcite , who showed that in the cold dark matter universe , more massive structures are more strongly clustered than their less massive counterparts .",
    "hence , the unrelaxed sb clusters ( @xmath95 km s@xmath5 ) are more likely to have a straight filament connecting them to a nearby companion cluster .",
    "we note that the detection of a significant fraction of our filaments remains uncertain because of low galaxy ( @xmath96 ) densities , so the quantities mentioned in this section may only be considered representative and not precise .    on a final note ,",
    "we suggest that sb clusters are most likely dynamically unrelaxed clusters , presently being assembled via galaxies falling in through straight filaments .",
    "the occurrence of starburst galaxies on the periphery of these clusters is a direct consequence of the way local conditions ( galaxy density and relative velocity ) are affected by the global layout of the cosmic web .",
    "compared to galaxies at @xmath72 , distant galaxies are more gas - rich .",
    "hence it would not be an exaggeration to say that such events of spectacular starbursts would be more commonly seen at higher redshifts .",
    "confirmation of this , however , can only result from the study of an unbiased list of high redshift clusters , sampled upto their infall regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see coppin et al .",
    "2011 for recent observations of star formation related fir emission on the outskirts of clusters at @xmath97 ) .",
    "once such data are available , one can ask whether the excess of star - forming galaxies observed in clusters at higher redshifts , the well known ` butcher - oemler effect ' @xcite is linked to the occurrence of starbursts in infalling galaxies , which appear to be nearer the cluster centre in projection @xcite . for a sample of x - ray - luminous clusters at @xmath98 , @xcite showed that the galaxy population in the cluster cores are the same at all epochs , but higher redshift clusters have a steeper gradient in the fraction of blue galaxies when the regions outside the core ( @xmath99 ) are considered .",
    "such colour - based studies , however , may have inherent problems due to the non - negligible fraction of galaxies that deviate from the normal correspondence between photometric colours and spectroscopically derived sfr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for instance ) .",
    "another interesting idea to explore , though relatively more plausible in simulations , is finding the likelihood of detecting a starburst  galaxy on a filament feeding a cluster along the line of sight",
    ". such a galaxy will appear near the centre of cluster , yet showing physical and intrinsic properties as that of its counterparts far away from the cluster core ( for instance see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    it would be very interesting to study the intermediate mass / dwarf ( @xmath100 ) galaxies , in the infall regions of the sb clusters , which may be harassed even more easily by their relatively massive counterparts .",
    "one needs to perform a detailed morphological analysis of the starburst galaxies , such as those studied in this work . considering galaxy - galaxy harassment to be the dominant environmental mechanism affecting the star formation properties of galaxies on cluster outskirts , one expects to see signatures of tidal interactions with neighbouring galaxies in visible or other short wavelength data @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the spatial resolution of the sdss photometry , used in this work , is not suitable for this , which we leave for future follow - up .",
    "using the integrated sfr ( and sfr/@xmath0 ) derived by b04 for galaxies in the sdss dr4 , the star formation properties of galaxies ( @xmath101 ) in the nearby ( @xmath102 ) abell clusters were analysed .",
    "the main results are summarised below :    * star formation activity in galaxies on the outskirts of some clusters is enhanced near their periphery ( r@xmath2 ) and further into the clusters at @xmath103r@xmath2 . in agreement with several other observational and simulations studies , we find that this enhancement in the sfr of galaxies on the clusters periphery is most likely due to enhanced galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "* starburst galaxies on cluster outskirts inhabit relatively denser environments , compared to other cluster galaxies at similar distances from the cluster centre . *",
    "clusters with evidence of enhanced star formation activity on their periphery are likely to be dynamically unrelaxed , and fed by straight and well - defined supercluster filaments . *",
    "the infalling galaxies ( @xmath104 ) in our clusters are a mix of galaxies that have passed through the cluster core at least once ( the ` backsplash ' population ) , and those which are falling into the cluster for the first time .",
