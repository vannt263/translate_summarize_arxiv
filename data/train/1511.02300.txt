    "typical object detection predicts the category of an object along with a 2d bounding box on the image plane for the visible part of the object . while this type of result is useful for some tasks , such as object retrieval , it is rather unsatisfying for doing any further reasoning grounded in the real 3d world . in this paper , we focus on the task of amodal 3d object detection in rgb - d images , which aims to produce an object s 3d bounding box that gives real - world dimensions at the object s full extent , regardless of truncation or occlusion .",
    "this kind of recognition is much more useful , for instance , in the perception - manipulation loop for robotics applications . but",
    "adding a new dimension for prediction significantly enlarges the search space , and makes the task much more challenging .",
    "the arrival of reliable and affordable rgb - d sensors ( , microsoft kinect ) has given us an opportunity to revisit this critical task .",
    "however navely converting 2d detection result to 3d does not work well ( see table [ fig:3ddetection ] and @xcite ) . to make good use of the depth information , sliding shapes @xcite was proposed to slide a 3d detection window in 3d space .",
    "while it is limited by the use of hand - crafted features , this approach naturally formulates the task in 3d .",
    "alternatively , depth rcnn @xcite takes a 2d approach : detect objects in the 2d image plane by treating depth as extra channels of a color image , then fit a 3d model to the points inside the 2d detected window by using icp alignment . given existing 2d and 3d approaches to the problem",
    ", it is natural to ask : * which representation is better for 3d amodal object detection , 2d or 3d ? *",
    "currently , the 2d - centric depth rcnn outperforms the 3d - centric sliding shapes .",
    "but perhaps depth rcnn s strength comes from using a well - designed deep network pre - trained with imagenet , rather than its 2d representation .",
    "is it possible to obtain an elegant but even more powerful 3d formulation by also leveraging deep learning in 3d ?    in this paper , we introduce deep sliding shapes , a complete 3d formulation to learn object proposals and classifiers using 3d convolutional neural networks ( convnets ) .",
    "we propose the first 3d region proposal network ( rpn ) that takes a 3d volumetric scene as input and outputs 3d object proposals ( figure [ fig : regionproposenet ] ) .",
    "it is designed to generate amodal proposals for whole objects at two different scales for objects with different sizes .",
    "we also propose the first joint object recognition network ( prn ) to use a 2d convnet to extract image features from color , and a 3d convnet to extract geometric features from depth ( figure [ fig : objectrecognet ] ) .",
    "this network is also the first to regress 3d bounding boxes for objects directly from 3d proposals .",
    "extensive experiments show that our 3d convnets can learn a more powerful representation for encoding geometric shapes ( table [ fig:3ddetection ] ) , than 2d representations ( hha in depth - rcnn ) .",
    "our algorithm is also much faster than depth - rcnn and the the original sliding shapes , as it only requires a single forward pass of the convnets in gpu at test time .",
    "our design fully exploits the advantage of 3d .",
    "therefore , our algorithm naturally benefits from the following five aspects : first , we can predict 3d bounding boxes without the extra step of fitting a model from extra cad data .",
    "this elegantly simplifies the pipeline , accelerates the speed , and boosts the performance because the network can directly optimize for the final goal .",
    "second , amodal proposal generation and recognition is very difficult in 2d , because of occlusion , limited field of view , and large size variation due to projection .",
    "but in 3d , because objects from the same category typically have similar physical sizes and the distraction from occluders falls outside the window , our 3d sliding - window proposal generation can support amodal detection naturally .",
    "third , by representing shapes in 3d , our convnet can have a chance to learn meaningful 3d shape features in a better aligned space .",
    "fourth , in the rpn , the receptive field is naturally represented in real world dimensions , which guides our architecture design .",
    "finally , we can exploit simple 3d context priors by using the manhattan world assumption to define bounding box orientations .",
    "while the opportunity is encouraging , there are also several unique challenges for 3d object detection .",
    "first , a 3d volumetric representation requires much more memory and computation . to address this issue",
    ", we propose to separate the 3d region proposal network with a low - res whole scene as input , and the object recognition network with high - res input for each object .",
    "second , 3d physical object bounding boxes vary more in size than 2d pixel - based bounding boxes ( due to photography and dataset bias ) @xcite . to address this issue",
    ", we propose a multi - scale region proposal network that predicts proposals with different sizes using different receptive fields .",
    "third , although the geometric shapes from depth are very useful , their signal is usually lower in frequency than the texture signal in color images . to address this issue",
    ", we propose a simple but principled way to jointly incorporate color information from the 2d image patch derived by projecting the 3d region proposal .",
    "deep convnets have revolutionized 2d image - based object detection .",
    "rcnn @xcite , fast rcnn @xcite , and faster rcnn @xcite are three iterations of the most successful state - of - the - art . beyond predicting only the visible part of an object",
    ", @xcite further extended rcnn to estimate the amodal box for the whole object .",
    "but their result is in 2d and only the height of the object is estimated , while we desire an amodal box in 3d .",

    "given a 3d space , we divide it into an equally spaced 3d voxel grid .",

    "but there are several unique challenges in 3d .",
    "first , because of an extra dimension , the possible locations for an object increases by 30 times .",
    "this makes the region proposal step much more important and challenging as it need to be more selective .",
    "second , we are interested in amodal detection that aims to estimate the full 3d box that covers the object at its full extent .",
    "hence an algorithm needs to infer the full box beyond the visible parts .",
    "third , different object categories have very different object size in 3d . in 2d , a picture typically only focuses on the object of interest due to photography bias .",
    "therefore , the pixel areas of object bounding boxes are all in a very limited range @xcite . for example",
