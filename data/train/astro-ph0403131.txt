    "circumstellar disks are common around stars at ages of a few million years .",
    "rotationally supported disks are a natural outcome of the star formation process , because of the need to conserve angular momentum during the collapse of the natal molecular core .",
    "in addition , disks are central to current theories of planet formation .",
    "these young disks are composed of gas and dust , with estimated masses as large as several percent of the stellar mass . by virtue of their large optical depths",
    ", they can be easily detected and have been intensively studied .    over the span of @xmath4510 myr",
    ", these primordial disks are thought to dissipate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on the observed decline of ir excesses , which originate from warm dust in the inner disk . at older ages , planetesimals and planets comprise the remaining circumstellar population .",
    "collisions between the planetesimals produce dust grains , which form a `` second - generation '' disk . the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) discovered the first example of a such dusty debris disk around vega @xcite .",
    "overall , volume - limited far - ir surveys have found that about 15% of main - sequence stars have debris disks .",
    "such disks have a small amount of dust , little evidence for gas , low characteristic temperatures indicative of grains at tens of  au separations , and a dearth of warm material in their inner regions .",
    "these attributes make debris disks physically distinct from primordial disks and lead to much weaker observational signatures .",
    "loss processes for the dust in debris disks act quickly compared to the age of the host stars , and the debris must be continually replenished .",
    "thus , studying debris disks over a wide range of ages can provide insight into their evolution and physical origin .",
    "most studies have focused on stars with ages of @xmath8200  myr , a reflection of the fact that most nearby stars are old .",
    "the last few years have seen the discovery of many stars which are both young ( @xmath9100  myr ) and close to earth ( @xmath10  pc ) .",
    "these stars have largely been found in kinematically associated moving groups , by combining accurate space motions with evidence for youthfulness ( e.g. , li abundances , x - ray emission , and chromospheric activity ) .",
    "they include the  pic  ( @xmath3820  myr ; @xcite ) and the local association ( @xmath320150  myr ; @xcite ) moving groups .",
    "these are important systems for disk studies as they span an age range which is poorly studied .",
    "in addition , this timescale is associated with assemblage of terrestrial planets in our own solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , so understanding disk properties at this epoch can illuminate the overall physical context for planet formation .",
    "given the cold characteristic temperatures of the dust ( @xmath340100  k ; e.g. , @xcite ) , sub - mm continuum observations of debris disks are valuable .",
    "the emission is optically thin and hence can be used to estimate the disk masses , with the caveat that large bodies are missed .",
    "previous sub - mm studies have focused on stars already known to have strong ir excesses @xcite , with the most outstanding examples being spatially resolved at sub - mm wavelengths (  pic , @xmath11  eri , fomalhaut , vega ) .",
    "much less has been done in the way of `` blind '' searches of stars in a given age range to understand their sub - mm disk frequency and properties . @xcite",
    "have recently surveyed the secondary stars of binaries with o and b - type primaries , a sample originally identified by . by virtue of the primary stars being on the main sequence ,",
    "the systems are @xmath12100  myr old .",
    "previous searches for dust around this sample had relatively poor sensitivity .",
    "of particular interest is the suggestion by wyatt  et al .",
    "that some stars may harbor very cold ( @xmath1240  k ) disks , which would be missed by previous far - ir searches and only detected in the sub - mm . however , one limitation of the lindroos sample is that most of the systems are fairly distant , which impacts the resulting disk sensitivity of sub - mm observations .    in this letter , we present an 850  search for cold dust around young stars in the  pic  and local association moving groups . unlike most previous sub - mm studies ,",
    "our sample was chosen solely on the basis of stellar age .",
    "our sample includes three m  dwarfs ( gj  182 , 799 and 803 ) which @xcite identified as the youngest of the nearby m  dwarfs , based on the stars pre - main sequence location on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the majority of debris disks from ir studies have been identified around a , f , and g - type dwarfs , simply due to observational sensitivity bias ( e.g. , compilations by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the loss processes for circumstellar dust depend on the host star luminosity and gravity .",
    "therefore , studying debris disks over a range of stellar masses may also advance our understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "sub - mm observations were made from december  2002 to november  2003 using the scuba bolometer array @xcite at the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",

    "we also observed gj  803 with scuba on november  1213 , 2003 in jiggle - mapping mode .",
    "the weather was stable during the observations with 850  zenith optical depths ranging from 0.26 to 0.29 .",
    "pointing was checked every 12 hours using neptune and was accurate to an rms error of 2 .",
    "flux calibrations were performed by observing uranus and neptune at the start of each night and were consistent between the two nights to within 10% .",
    "a total of 24  individual maps were made at a range of image rotation angles on the array .",

    "the emission is also consistent with being centered on the star given the pointing uncertainties .    a sensitive search for co  @xmath13  32 line emission from gj  803 was conducted with the b3  dual - channel heterodyne receiver and digital autocorrelating spectrometer ( das ) backend on the jcmt on november  5 , 2003 .",

    "the probability of any background objects to be within an angular distance @xmath39 of a target is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the surface density of background objects above a specified flux level .",
    "we compute the ensemble probability of detecting any background objects in scuba s central bolometer for our entire sample of 8  objects , accounting for the fact that we mapped gj  803 .",

    "our raw 850  sensitivity ( median rms of 1.9  mjy ) is poorer than the @xcite survey of lindroos binaries ( median rms of 1.6  mjy ) . but given the much closer distances of our targets , our dust mass sensitivity is better by around an order of magnitude . in particular , figure  [ agetrend ] shows the following :    1 .",
    "compared to primordial disks around t  tauri and herbig  ae / be stars which have dust masses of @xmath310300  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dust masses for the detected young stars are @xmath410@xmath5 smaller .",
    "this points to very rapid evolution of the circumstellar dust mass within the first @xmath410  myr , likely arising from grain removal ( e.g. , via accretion onto the central star ) and/or grain growth into larger bodies , which would greatly diminish the sub - mm / mm emission .",
    "the upper envelope for disk masses around a  stars exceeds that for later - type stars",
    ". this may reflect the distribution of primordial disk masses ; for t  tauri stars a similar trend is seen , where the upper envelope of primordial disk masses is larger for more massive stars @xcite .",
    "3 .   for stars of @xmath47  myr old , nearly all the detected disks at a given spectral type ( i.e. , stellar mass ) are less massive than the upper limits on non - detections .",
    "this highlights the fact that existing sub - mm measurements are only sensitive to the most massive of the young debris disks .",
    "4 .   the apparent correlation of dust mass with stellar age arises from observational bias : the young stars detected in the sub - mm are at larger distances than the old stars .",
    "however , the decline in the upper envelope of disk masses with age is probably a real effect .",
    "while there are no published sub - mm data in the upper right of figure  [ agetrend ] ( i.e. , old stars with massive disks ) , the existing sub - mm detections of nearby , old stars come from sources known to possess large ir excesses in _",
    "iso _  data .",
    "any old stars with even more massive disks would have been detected by these ir surveys , unless the dust was unprecedentedly cold .",
    "based on the data in figure  [ agetrend ] , the masses of sub - mm detected disks evolve roughly as @xmath48 , with a simple unweighted fit giving @xmath49 .",
    "gj  182 and gj  803 are the first m - star debris disks detected at sub - millimeter wavelengths.10  myr old tw hydrae association @xcite .",
    "hen  3 - 600 has a very large dust optical depth , a significant 1020  excess @xcite , and active gas accretion @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are distinct from debris disks and indicate that the hen  3 - 600 disk is primordial or else in a transitional state . ] the dust lifetime is short compared to the stars ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the dust must be replenished by collisions between planetesimals , either in situ or else from regions farther out .",
    "note that for these low luminosity stars ( 0.10.2  ) , radiation pressure on the grains is negligible compared to the star s gravity , unlike debris disks around a  stars , e.g. ,  pic  where micron - sized and smaller grains are expelled @xcite .",
    "our work shows that most debris disks around low - mass stars probably lie at or below the sensitivity limits of the _ iras _  survey and jcmt / scuba observations .",
    "gj  182 is just at the practical limit for _ iras _  and scuba detection .",
    "gj  803 is the nearest object in our sample , and among the nearest known young stars , which makes detection of its very tenuous dust mass feasible .",
    "the one undetected m  dwarf in our sample , gj  799 , is just as close and young as gj  803 .",
    "gj  799 is known to be a 3binary of comparable magnitude @xcite , which may impact its dust content .",
    "in addition , its m4.5 spectral type corresponds to @xmath500.100.15  , about 34@xmath51 smaller than for gj  182 and gj  803 ( e.g. , see models presented in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the non - detection may simply be due to insufficient sensitivity ; our jcmt data for gj  799 would have to be @xmath34@xmath51 deeper in order to reach the same @xmath52 as for the two detected m  dwarfs .",
    "primordial disks are common around low mass stars @xcite and even brown dwarfs @xcite at ages of a few  myr , and these systems may very well generate debris disks as they age .",
    "spitzer space telescope _ will offer the requisite sensitivity for detecting and studying such disks .",
    "for gj  182 , the 25  excess suggests that dust resides in the inner regions of its disk : 150200  k blackbody grains would lie at 12  au from the star .",
    "given the sparse sampling of the current sed , one can not determine if the dust distribution is continuous throughout the disk , or if there is a gap in the middle regions of the disk ( e.g. , from planet formation ) between the 25  and 850  emitting dust .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , single band excesses near the sensitivity limit of the _ iras _  catalog may not be reliable . though the scanpi detection of gj  182 has s / n  =  4.6 , higher than the s / n  =  24 objects examined by song et al .",
    ", for now we treat the 25  excess of gj  182 as tentative .",
    "more detailed sed measurements , in particular with _ spitzer _ , would be invaluable to characterize this star s disk .    the absence of warm dust in the inner regions of gj  803 ( and perhaps gj  182 , if the 25  detection is spurious ) is naturally explained by an unseen inner companion .",
    "the 40  k temperature characteristic of the sed is too cold to be explained by sublimation or melting of icy grains ( @xmath3100 - 170  k ) . without an inner companion ,",
    "the effect of poynting - robertson drag would cause grains to spiral inward and produce significant mid - ir emission .",
    "such inner holes are typical for debris disk systems .",
    "indeed , the few debris disks with resolved dust emission show morphologies highly suggestive of the dynamical influence of an unseen companion at mean - motion resonances @xcite .    the 40  k characteristic temperature from the sed",
    "fitting means that blackbody grains around gj  803 would be at a distance of 17  au , or an impressively large angular separation of 1.7 .",
    "( for gj  182 , 17  au corresponds to only 0.6 . )",
    "this provides only a rough guide as to the angular separation of any interior companion , since it is difficult to use the seds of debris disks to predict the spatial dust distribution @xcite .",
    "shallow ir adaptive optics imaging from the keck observatory with 0.05  resolution shows no stellar or massive brown dwarf companion , suggesting that an even lower mass companion is present . to date , gj  876 is the only m  dwarf known to have extrasolar planets @xcite ; its two planets have semi - major axes of 0.13 and 0.21  au .    thus the gj  803 inner disk hole may indicate that planets can exist at larger separations around m  dwarfs than known so far and that such planets can form within @xmath310  myr .",
    "furthermore , given the very young age of the system , a planetary companion is predicted to have significant thermal emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence might be detectable with deeper ao imaging .",
    "m  dwarfs are by far the most numerous type of star , so a better understanding of their planet - bearing frequency is needed for a complete census of the extrasolar planet population .",
    "follow - up coronagraphic imaging by @xcite finds that gj  803 has a large , nearly edge - on disk seen in scattered optical light .",
    "this disk is detected from 521  ( 50210  au ) , though the inner and outer extent are not well - constrained .",
    "our sub - mm imaging finds that the 850  dust emission is unresolved .",
    "this is entirely compatible with the large optical disk , given that the grains responsible for scattering may be very cold and/or small , and hence poor sub - mm emitters .",
    "deeper sub - mm mapping is needed for stronger constraints on any extended emission . in general , the proximity and youthfulness of gj  803 , combined with the high sub - mm and optical detectability of its disk , make this system an excellent opportunity to study disk evolution , and perhaps planet formation , in great detail .",
    "the onset and duration of the debris disk phenomenon remain open questions . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", the disk masses might slowly decay over time , or perhaps the mass distribution is bimodal , reflecting `` on '' and `` off '' states for detectability . the gj  803 debris disk offers some insight into this issue . using the _ hipparcos _ catalog , which is nearly complete for early - type m  dwarfs ( m0m2 ) within 10  pc , @xcite found gj  803 was the only object out of a sample of 152  m  dwarfs to possess an ir excess in the _ iras _  fsc .",
    "this is not due to detection bias , as there are many early - type m  dwarfs which have closer distances than gj  803 .",
    "gj  803 is also known to be among the youngest of the nearby m  dwarfs @xcite .",
    "if the appearance of debris disks was an intermittent event , song et al .  should have detected older m  dwarfs with ir excesses at both 60  and 100  , if their disks were like the gj  803 one .",
    "either these older m  dwarfs do not have disks , or their disks are much less massive than gj  803 .",
    "therefore , at least for the case of m  dwarfs , the gj  803 system suggests that the time evolution of debris disks is driven primarily by age , with the youngest stars having the largest disk masses .",

    "<S> we present results from a jcmt / scuba 850  search for cold dust around eight nearby young stars belonging to the  pic(@xmath0  myr ) and the local association ( @xmath1  myr ) moving groups . unlike most past sub - mm studies , </S>",
    "<S> our sample was chosen solely on the basis of stellar age . </S>",
    "<S> our observations achieve about an order of magnitude greater sensitivity in dust mass compared to previous work in this age range . </S>",
    "<S> we detected two of the three m  dwarfs in our sample at 850  , gj  182 and gj  803 ( @xmath2 ) , with inferred dust masses of only @xmath30.010.03  . </S>",
    "<S> gj  182 may also possess a 25  excess , indicative of warm dust in the inner few  au of its disk . </S>",
    "<S> for gj  803 ( au  mic ; hd  197481 ) , sub - mm mapping finds that the 850  emission is unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> a non - detection of the co  32 line indicates the system is gas - poor , and the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of a large inner disk hole ( @xmath317  au = 1.7  in radius for blackbody grains ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are possible indications that planets at large separations can form around m  dwarfs within @xmath410  myr . in a companion paper ( kalas , liu & matthews 2004 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the existence of a dust disk around gj  803 using optical coronagraphic imaging . </S>",
    "<S> given its youthfulness , proximity , and detectability , the gj  803 disk will be a valuable system for studying disk , and perhaps planet , formation in great detail . </S>",
    "<S> overall , sub - mm measurements of debris disks point to a drop in dust mass by a factor of @xmath410@xmath5 within the first @xmath410  myr , with the subsequent decline in the masses of sub - mm detected disks consistent with @xmath6 to @xmath7 . </S>"
