    "for more than a decade semiconductor quantum dots have been in research focus for quantum information processing.@xcite the experimental control over the electron spin in quantum dots has seen enormous progress , with lateral gated gaas structures demonstrating the state of the art.@xcite magnetic@xcite and electric@xcite coherent spin manipulations have been demonstrated , while the electron spin measurement has been achieved using spin to charge conversion techniques.@xcite for the latter , double dots@xcite have proven especially useful exploiting the spin coulomb blockade.@xcite however , the gaas spin qubit seems to have reached its fundamental limit for the coherence which is due to the nuclear spins inherent in all iii - v semiconductors.@xcite    materials composed of atoms without nuclear magnetic moment , such as si and c , seem a natural solution for the problem of the nuclear induced decoherence.@xcite that is why si based quantum dots have recently seen a revived interest .",
    "although the quantum dot technology is not yet as mature as in gaas , several perspective setups are being actively pursued.@xcite we note that a spin to charge conversion was reported recently.@xcite in addition to the absence of nuclear spins , si seems potentially advantageous because of weaker spin - orbit interactions , promising less decoherence , and a stronger @xmath0 factor , allowing spin control at smaller magnetic fields .    on the other hand , the electron effective mass in si is larger than in gaas , so si dots must be smaller at a given orbital energy scale .",
    "in addition , and perhaps more seriously , a major issue for silicon based quantum computation is the valley degeneracy of its conduction band electrons.@xcite in the bulk , the conduction band minima are located at the @xmath1 valleys , that is at @xmath2 , @xmath3 , toward the six @xmath1 points of the brillouin zone , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the lattice constant.@xcite in a ( 001)-grown si heterostructure the valley degeneracy is partially lifted due to the presence of the interface and/or due to strain,@xcite leaving a twofold conduction band minimum , the @xmath6 valleys , which are separated from the fourfold excited valley states by at least @xmath7,@xcite large enough to neglect the upper four valleys.@xcite the remaining twofold valley degeneracy is lifted if the perpendicular confinement is asymmetric .",
    "then the orbital wave functions become symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the single valley states,@xcite which are separated by the energy difference called the ground - state gap@xcite ( or valley splitting ) .    in recent years",
    "the origin and possible control of the valley splitting has been in focus .",
    "measurements in silicon heterostructures reveal a valley splitting of the order of @xmath8.@xcite on the other hand , theoretical estimates of perfectly flat structures propose a splitting about three orders of magnitude larger.@xcite taking into account detailed properties of the interface ( e.g. , roughness ) , experiment and theory come to an agreement,@xcite and additional ( in - plane ) confinement allows the valley splitting to reach values of the order of @xmath9.@xcite in si / sio@xmath10 systems , the splitting can even be tens of @xmath9.@xcite here we assume that the splitting is at least @xmath11 and we can use the effective single valley approximation,@xcite in which only the lowest valley eigenstate is considered .",
    "this choice is strengthened by the fact that electron spins in valley - degenerate dots would not be viable qubits.@xcite    in the single valley approximation , the si dot resembles the fairly well understood gaas one .",
    "the main goal of this article is to carry out a comparison on a quantitative level , providing realistic values for the electron spin relaxation as available for gaas dots.@xcite    the relevant sources of spin relaxation in gaas quantum dots in a magnetic field are the electron - phonon couplings modeled by the piezoelectric and deformation potential theory.@xcite since silicon is not piezoelectric , only the deformation potential mechanism remains . from this point of view , a si dot is closer to ingaas than to gaas , as in ingaas the relative importance of the deformation versus the piezoelectric potential is enhanced due to a larger @xmath0 factor.@xcite however , differently from ( in)gaas , in which transverse acoustic phonons do not contribute to the deformation potential coupling , both transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons cause spin relaxation in si.@xcite in the present work special attention is given to the importance of the transverse phonons and to the role of the dilatation and shear potential constants , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , which parameterize the electron - phonon coupling strengths .    in si ,",
    "the spin relaxation / decoherence rates were computed perturbatively for single dot single electron@xcite and single@xcite and double@xcite dot singlet - triplet transitions . also the spin relaxation due to",
    "the modulation of electron @xmath0 factor by the phonon - induced strain was investigated.@xcite experimentally the rates were measured on quantum dot ensembles@xcite and on a many - electron quantum dot,@xcite and a few electron quantum dot.@xcite we obtain the spin relaxation rates non - perturbatively , using exact numerical diagonalization , for a wide range of magnetic fields and interdot coupling .",
    "our results allow us to discuss regimes beyond the validity of perturbative treatments and to specify the accuracy of common approximations .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "comparing with a recent experiment , we find that ( i ) the results of the experiment indicate that the main spin relaxation channel is the mechanism we study here , and ( ii ) the spin - orbit coupling strength of @xmath14 seems realistic for the si / sige lateral quantum dots .",
    "we also present analytical formulas for the spin relaxation rate in the lowest order of the spin - orbit interactions . comparing with exact numerics",
    ", we demonstrate that these formulas are quantitatively reliable up to modest magnetic fields of 1 - 2 t. we find that a further analytical simplification often adopted , the isotropic averaging of the interaction strengths , leads to a result correct only within an order of magnitude . in sec .",
    "iv.b we deal with the double dot case and demonstrate that here the spin relaxation rate is sensitive to the spectral anticrossings ( spin hot spots),@xcite especially if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the heterostructure . for in - plane fields , the anisotropy of the spin - orbit interactions leads to the appearance of easy passages  magnetic field directions in which the relaxation rate is quenched by many orders of magnitude.@xcite these results are analogous to the gaas quantum dots .",

    "we find it an excellent approximation to the numerics up to magnetic fields of 1 - 2 t. a further simplification , the isotropic averaging , makes the analytical result to differ from the exact one by a factor of the order of 1 .",
    "we showed that in the double dot the relaxation rate is a much more complicated function of the magnetic field and the interdot coupling , the two parameters most directly controllable experimentally .",
    "this is due to the fact that the rate is strongly influenced by spin hot spots , which occur at much lower magnetic fields in the double dot compared to the single dot .",
    "the anisotropy of the spin - orbit interactions leads to the rates dependent on the magnetic field direction with respect to the crystallographic axes . in a double dot , where the rotational symmetry of the potential is broken but the reflection symmetry is preserved , this anisotropy results in the appearance of easy passages  special directions of the external magnetic field which assure a strong suppression of the relaxation rate . from these directions",
    "the ratio of the spin - orbit strengths can be found .",
    "compared to gaas , in si the easy passage position relates directly to the linear spin - orbit strengths without being influenced by the spin - orbit interaction cubic - in - momenta .",
    "finally , we observed that compared to gaas , the spin relaxation rates in si are typically 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller , as a result of the absence of the piezoelectric phonon interaction and generally weaker spin - orbit interactions ."
