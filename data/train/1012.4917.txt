    "half of the elements heavier than iron are produced by rapid neutron captures in a yet unknown astrophysical scenario . after the initial success of @xcite in reproducing observed solar r - process abundances ,",
    "core - collapse supernovae and the subsequent neutrino - driven winds became one of the most promising candidates for the production of r - process elements because their extreme explosive conditions are very close to the ones needed for the r - process ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , galactic chemical evolution models favor core - collapse supernovae , since they occur early and frequently enough to account for the abundances observed in old halo stars and in the solar system @xcite .",
    "although the necessary conditions to produce heavy elements ( @xmath0 ) are identified @xcite ( high entropies , low electron fractions , and short expansion timescales ) , these are not found in the most recent long - time supernova simulations .",
    "when a supernova explodes , matter surrounding the proto - neutron star is heated by neutrinos and expands very fast reaching sometimes even supersonic velocity @xcite .",
    "this neutrino - driven wind moves through the early supernova ejecta and eventually collides with it .",
    "the interaction of the wind with the slow - moving ejecta results in a wind termination shock or reverse shock where kinetic energy is transformed into internal energy . therefore ,",
    "the expansion velocity drops and the temperature ( and thus the entropy ) increases after the reverse shock .",
    "the matter near the proto - neutron star consists mainly of neutrons and protons due to the high temperatures in this region . when a mass element expands , its temperature decreases and neutrons and protons recombine to form alpha particles .",
    "the density also decreases but the triple - alpha reaction combined with different alpha capture reactions are still operating , resulting in heavy seed nuclei @xcite . the evolution once the alpha particles start forming heavier nuclei depends on the neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "the results presented here are based on our hydrodynamic simulations @xcite where the neutron - to - seed ratio is too low for the r - process to produce elements up to the third peak ( @xmath2 ) . in sect .",
    "[ sec : lepp ] the nucleosynthesis obtained from such simulations is discussed . in sect .",
    "[ sec : rprocess ] we have used the neutrino - driven wind simulations with the entropy artificially increased to study the impact of the long - time evolution and nuclear physics input on the dynamical r - process .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the investigatigation of the nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds is done in two steps .",
    "first , the evolution of the supernova ejecta is followed during several seconds with hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "second , the composition is calculated by means of extended nuclear reaction networks which include nuclei from stability to both drip lines , reaching thus regions where no experimental data are available and theoretical predictions are quite uncertain .    the modeling of the supernova ejecta during several seconds after explosion is currently difficult since the supernova explosion mechanism is not yet well understood @xcite and it is computationally expensive to perform long - time , multidimensional , systematic studies for different progenitor stars , as would be desirable in nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "possible ways to overcome this limitation include using parametric steady - state wind models ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and forcing an explosion by artificially changing neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the outflow is rather independent of the details of the explosion mechanism , but depends more on the evolution of the neutron star and on the neutrino emission .",
    "therefore , such approximations are a good basis for nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "although steady - state wind models can not consistently describe hydrodynamical effects ( e.g. , reverse shock or multidimensional instabilities ) , both approaches agree in the wind phase @xcite .    for our nucleosynthesis studies we use trajectories , i.e. density and temperature evolutions , from ref .",
    "the composition is calculated initially by assuming nuclear statistical equilibrium at @xmath3  gk , almost only nucleons and few alpha particles are present .",
    "the evolution of the composition is then followed using a full reaction network @xcite , which includes nuclei from h to hf with both neutron- and proton - rich isotopes .",
    "reactions with neutral and charged particles were taken from the calculations of the statistical code non - smoker @xcite and experimental rates were included ( nacre , @xcite ) when available .",
    "the theoretical weak interaction rates are the same as in ref .",
    "when the conditions of the supernova outflow are favourable for the r - process , i.e. high neutron - to - seed ratio , we use a r - process network after charged - particle reactions freeze out .",
    "this network , which includes photodissotiation , neutron capture , beta decay , and fission , is fully implicit .",
    "therefore , it can be used to study the late evolution when matter decays to stability and the neutron density becomes very low .",
    "most of the recent progress in understanding the origin of elements commonly associated with the r - process is due to observations of ultra metal - poor ( ump ) stars ( see @xcite for recent review ) .",
    "the elemental abundances observed in the atmosphere of these very old stars come from a few events",
    ". these stars generally present a robust pattern for `` heavy '' elements @xmath4 , in agreement with the expected contribution of the r - process to the solar system , but show some scatter for `` light '' elements @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that at least two types of events contribute to the r - process abundances .",
    "qian and wasserburg @xcite argued that supernovae from low - mass progenitors with @xmath6 lead to all `` heavy '' and some `` light '' elements , and that explosions of more massive progenitors , @xmath7 , contribute to the remaining light @xmath1 elements .",
    "the process leading to elements with @xmath1 has been called in the literature the weak r - process @xcite , charged - particle reaction ( cpr ) process , and light elemental primary process ( lepp ) @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as lepp because such name does not make any reference to the specific nuclear reactions or astrophysical environment .",
    "the term lepp was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite which used a galactic chemical evolution model to search for possible astrophysical environments producing the elements such as sr , y , and zr . taking into account the standard s - process and r - process contributions",
    ", they found that non - negligible abundances of several isotopes ( @xmath8sr , @xmath9nb , @xmath10mo , @xmath11ru , @xmath12pd , @xmath13cd ) were still unexplained .",
    "they argued that a new `` light element primary process '' may have produced them and they discussed where and how this lepp could occur in order to explain their solar system abundances .",
    "montes et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the lepp observed in ump stars show a hint of robustness of the process and could have contributed to the solar system abundances .    [",

    "our results confirm that no heavy r - process elements can be synthesized in such explosions , however the lepp can be realized based on the simulations and for a range of realistic conditions . by comparing models 15 m and 15m(s ) , we explore the known dependence of the nucleosynthesis on the entropy and expansion timescale @xcite .",
    "the third wind parameter is the electron fraction which is given by the neutrino properties determined by neutrino interactions and transport .",
    "therefore , the exact calculation of the electron fraction remains a very challenging open problem @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : neut2col ] shows the electron neutrino and antineutrino energies for different supernova models .",
    "the antineutrino energy has decrease as the neutrino reactions and transport have been improved leading to proton - rich winds in the most recent simulations as shown by the @xmath15 contours .",
    "this motivated our exploration of the impact of the electron fraction on the production of the lepp elements .",

    "[ fig : prich ] shows that the lepp pattern ( dots obtained from observation as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is reproduced in proton - rich winds .",
    "moreover , we found that this abundance pattern is quite robust under small variations of the evolution of @xmath15 and of the wind parameters ( e.g. changes of 20% in the entropy ) .",
    "however , elements heavier than iron - group nuclei can be produced only when the neutrino fluxes are high enough to allow a successful @xmath19p - process @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : prich ] shows the production factor for various isotopes ( see @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "although there is no overproduction ( i.e. production factors are below dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : prich ] ) and the elemental abundances nicely reproduce the observed lepp pattern in ump stars , almost only neutron - deficient isotopes ( p - nuclei ) are produced .",
    "therefore , proton - rich conditions can explain the lepp elements observed in ump stars but not the missing isotopic abundances in the solar system @xcite .",
    "an exciting possibility of proton - rich winds is the synthesis of the light p - nuclei , since mainly neutron - deficient isotopes are present in the wind ejecta @xcite .     at 1s to @xmath20 at 10s following @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows the corresponding production factors which are well below the overproduction limit marked by the dotted line and that almost only p - nuclei are synthesized .",
    "the isotopes marked with circles are not produced in enough quantities in the model of ref .",

    "the right panel shows the corresponding production factors which are well below the overproduction limit marked by the dotted line and that almost only p - nuclei are synthesized .",
    "the isotopes marked with circles are not produced in enough quantities in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite and are expected to be produced by the lepp.,title=\"fig : \" ]    when the electron fraction is assumed to evolve towards neutron - rich conditions , the lepp pattern can be also reproduced but it is very sensible under variations of @xmath15 or of the wind parameters .",
    "this scenario may contribute to the lepp elements found in the solar system abundances because neutron - rich isotopes are produced .",
    "however , we find an overproduction around @xmath21 that was already pointed out in previous nucleosynthesis studies based on supernova simulations ( see e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "this overproduction problem and the fact that most recent supernova simulations @xcite favor proton - rich winds could suggest that neutron - rich winds are rare events .",
    "observation of isotopic abundances in ump stars are very promising to constraint the neutron richness of the neutrino - driven wind and thus the evolution of the electron fraction and the neutrino properties in supernovae .",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of r - process abundances to the combined effects of the long - time dynamical evolution and nuclear physics input and provide a link between the behaviour of nuclear masses far from stability and features in the final abundances .",
    "the trajectory for this study is also from the neutrino - driven wind simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite where no heavy r - process elements can be synthesized @xcite . therefore , we need to artificially increase the neutron - to - seed ratio ( by increasing the entropy by a factor two ) in order to produce the third r - process peak .",
    "this allows us to study the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in a typical high - entropy neutrino - driven wind in a more consistent way than with fully parametric expansions @xcite or with steady - state wind models ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , which can not consistently explore the interaction of the wind with the slow supernova ejecta that results in a reverse shock .",
    "the evolution of temperature and density during the alpha - process determines the neutron - to - seed ratio and thus the possibility of forming heavy elements .",
    "however , the dynamical evolution after the freeze - out of charged - particle reactions is affecting the final abundances . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rs_td ] we present the three trajectories used for our calculations .",
    "the trajectory labeled as `` unmodified '' correspond to the hydrodynamical simulations with the entropy increased and the reverse shock as in the simulations .",
    "we change the position of the reverse shock to investigate the effect of the variation of the dynamical evolution during the r - process , keeping the same initial neutron - to - seed . in the trajectory labeled as @xmath22",
    "gk the reverse shock is at high temperatures , while in the one labeled as `` no rs '' there is no reverse shock .",
    "the abundances resulting from these three evolution are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rs_td ] , compared to the solar abundances shown by dots .",
    "notice that the long time evolution has a big impact on the position of the peaks and on the troughs .         when the reverse shock is at high temperatures the evolution proceeds under a @xmath23@xmath24 equilibrium which lasts until neutrons are exhausted .",
    "this equilibrium evolution is similar to the classical r - process @xcite and it is also known as hot r - process @xcite . if the evolution proceeds at low temperatures ( @xmath25gk ) , there is a competition between neutron capture and beta decay .",
    "this non - equilibrium evolution correspond to the cold r - process introduced in ref .",
    "figure  [ fig : rs_tau ] shows the evolution of timescales for the three relevant processes : neutron capture , photodissociation , and beta decay .",
    "the main difference between hot ( left panel ) and cold ( right panel ) r - process is that in the latter photodissociation is negligible .",
    "therefore , the r - process path can move farther away from stability reaching nuclei with shorter half - lives and leading to a faster evolution and an earlier freeze out .",
    "moreover , neutron separation energies have less impact on the final abundances because they enter only through the neutron capture cross section .",
    "notice that photodissociation depends exponentially on the neutron separation energy .",
    "the importance of the different nuclear physics input depends thus on the dynamical evolution , therefore all our studies are performed with the equilibrium and non - equilibrium evolutions @xcite .",

    "the presence and position of peaks and trough in the abundances depends on features of the two neutron separation energy ( @xmath26 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2npath ] .",
    "when @xmath26 abruptly drops for increasing @xmath27 , matter accumulates leading to the formation of peaks .",
    "while in regions where @xmath26 is flat or presents a saddle point behaviour , several neutron captures occur almost instantaneously leaving a trough in the abundances .",
    "this feature of the two neutron separation energy is present in all mass models before @xmath28 as nuclei change from deformed to spherical . in the equilibrium evolution , where photodissociation is very important , this leads to the formation of a big trough in the abundances at the moment neutrons are almost exhausted , i.e. when @xmath29 . afterwards ,",
    "as matter decays to stability , neutron capture can fill up this trough or make it bigger as it occurs in the abundances based on etfsi - q .",
    "our results shown in fig .  [ fig : abundmm ] present also some behaviours that are characteristic of every mass model . in etfsi - q",
    "the quench before @xmath30 leads to a slow down of the evolution and to a delayed freeze - out .",
    "moreover , the fluctuation of @xmath26 before @xmath28 in this mass model makes the trough around @xmath31 bigger due to neutron captures when matter moves back to stability .",
    "results based on frdm are clearly affected by the anomalous behaviour of @xmath26 before @xmath32 , which produces the accumulation of matter and thus the formation of peaks around @xmath33 even in the non - equilibrium evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abundmm ] ) .",
    "the abundances at freeze - out present a lot of fluctuations while the final ones , after decay to stability , are smooth like the solar system abundances . in the classical r - process calculation ( waiting point approximation )",
    "this is explained by beta - delayed neutron emission ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in dynamical r - process calculations also neutron captures contribute to redistribution of matter .",
    "the neutron captures become very important after freeze out , when only few neutrons are available and nuclei compete to capture them .",
    "we find that the rare earth peak is due to neutron captures when matter moves back to stability , as suggested in ref .",
    "this implies that the freeze out can not be very fast because neutrons are still needed to form this feature which is present in the solar r - process abundances .",
    "finally , we found that the main contribution of the beta - delayed neutron emission is the supply of neutrons . in our equilibrium evolution",
    "there are almost no difference in the abundance calculated with and without beta - delayed neutron emission .",
    "since temperature are high , photodissociation prevents the path to reach the regions far from stability where the probability of emitting neutrons after beta decay is higher .",
    "in contrast , in the non - equilibrium evolution the neutron density is significantly smaller when no beta - delayed neutron emission is assumed .",
    "the evolution of the neutron - to - seed ratio is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : betan ] for the calculations with and without beta - delayed neutron emission .",
    "the significant smaller neutron - to - seed ratio , when non beta - delayed neutron emission is considered ( green line ) , leads to less shift of the third peak after freeze - out but also inhibits the formation of the rare earth peak ( right panel in fig .",

    "recent long - time supernova simulations do not produce r - process elements because the wind entropy is too low and the electron fraction high , even staying proton rich during several seconds @xcite .",

    "neutron - rich winds are necessary to explain the lepp isotopes found in the solar system abundances , but they do not lead to a robust pattern and overproduced nuclei around a=90 .",
    "this suggests that only a small fraction of the supernovae or of the mass ejected by them can be neutron rich .",
    "future observations of isotopic abundances in ultra - metal poor stars could constrain the evolution of the electron fraction in the neutrino - driven winds and thus the neutrino properties ( energy and luminosity ) .",
