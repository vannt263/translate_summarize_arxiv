    "the notion of parallel transport plays an important role in physics .",
    "elementary particles and the fields whose point - like excitations describe them , may be thought of as carrying representations of lie algebras .",
    "to describe the dynamics , vector fields at nearby points must be compared , and parallel transport provides a self - consistent way of doing so .",
    "when the particles are charged , parallel transport requires the existence of a connection on a fiber bundle constructed on space - time .",
    "this connection is called a gauge field , and all interactions of particles can be described by these gauge fields .",
    "the dynamics of gauge fields are described by nonlinear ( yang - mills ) theories , and it is expected that in the strong coupling regime there are extended objects , such as strings , or flux tubes in the theory .",
    "so it is worthwhile to consider parallel transport of string - like objects .",
    "there is an immediate obstacle to parallel transporting ` charged ' flux tubes . for particles ,",
    "parallel transport involves carrying a vector ( in some lie algebra ) along a specified curve in space - time .",
    "consider an infinitesimal curve of length @xmath0 and tangent @xmath1 then parallel transport is a group action , where the vector is acted upon by a group element of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the connection .",
    "now , curves can be joined end to end , infinitesimal curves can be joined to produce a finite curve .",
    "joining curves is the same as composition of the corresponding group elements , and thus it becomes possible to define the parallel transport of a vector along any finite curve in terms of group elements .",
    "so given a starting point and a connection , a curve can be uniquely identified with a group element by taking the path ordered exponential of the gauge field @xmath4 along that curve .",
    "this identification is called the holonomy of the curve .",
    "this procedure can not be generalized to extended objects except trivially .",
    "that is , suppose i could associate an element of some group to the infinitesimal parallel transport of a string , a sort of ` surface holonomy ' . for simplicity ,",
    "let me take the string to be infinitesimal as well .",
    "now let me try to construct the parallel transport of a finite string between two finitely separated configurations , say with the same end points .",
    "i should break up a surface bounded by these two configurations into infinitesimal surface elements , bounded by infinitesimal portions of ` intermediate ' configurations of the string . since i know the surface holonomy of each little area element , can i compose them to get the holonomy for the entire surface ?",
    "the answer is no , for the simple reason that there is no canonical way of ordering surfaces .",
    "so the infinitesimal areas may be composed in any order one likes , and each different ordering will give a different holonomy for the whole surface . unless , that is , the holonomy for infinitesimal surfaces is either trivial ( identity ) or abelian  @xcite .",
    "one way of defining a surface holonomy is to equate it with the holonomy of a closed loop around the surface , i.e. by taking the path ordered exponential of a gauge field along the boundary of the surface element .",
    "if the gauge field is non - abelian , it follows that surface holonomy defined this way is well defined only if the gauge field is flat , i.e. has vanishing curvature .",
    "the question that remains is whether it is possible to give an alternative definition of the surface holonomy such that it can vanish without forcing the gauge field to be flat .",
    "however there is still the problem that two infinitesimal squares can be composed in two ways , along a common edge , and at a common vertex .",
    "so it seems clear that holonomy for surfaces can not be thought of as elements of a group .",
    "it turns out that categorical lie groups , or lie 2-groups , which naturally have two types of group composition rules , provide an appropriate description of surface holonomy . in this paper",
    "i discuss and relate different approaches to defining a surface holonomy in terms of lie 2-groups .    in  [ defs ]",
    ", the definition of a lie 2-group , or a categorical lie group , is given following  @xcite .",
    "two dimensional parallel transport will be described by these structures .",
    "one - dimensional flux tubes are transported along two - dimensional surfaces , whose geometric composition corresponds to composition of elements in a lie 2-group .    in  [ holonomy ]",
    ", the construction of surface holonomy is briefly described following  @xcite .",
    "separate group elements , or holonomies , are associated to the face and edges of an infinitesimal surface element .",
    "the edge holonomy requires a gauge field , a one - form @xmath4 valued in a lie algebra , while the face holonomy requires a two - form @xmath5 valued in another lie algebra .",
    "the face and edge holonomies are thus elements of two different groups , and combine according to the composition laws of the 2-group when the surfaces are composed .",
    "the total holonomy of the surface vanishes , @xmath6    in  [ twoconn ] , a different approach is employed . instead of thinking in terms of parallel transporting infinitesimal strings ,",
    "fields are transported along strings as well as along paths between nearby string configurations .",
    "in addition to the connection field which transports along a string configuration , a second one - form connection @xmath7 is introduced , rather than a two - form , for transporting between nearby configurations . demanding that such parallel transport be unambiguous leads to an integrability condition involving both @xmath4 and @xmath8 allowing @xmath7 to take any value subject to this constraint produces an effective field theory of two - forms .",
    "the paper ends with some discussions in  [ disc ] about the meaning of surface holonomy and related constructions , given that category theory does not magically create a canonical ordering for surfaces .",
    "parallel transports of fields defined at a point are described by groups .",
    "it is natural to expect that parallel transport of objects defined on curves or ` strings ' will require two groups , one for comparing the values of a field at nearby points of the string , and another group for comparisons between nearby string configurations .",
    "it turns out that the two groups combine to form a categorical group , or a lie 2-group .",
    "a category consists of a set @xmath9 of objects and a set @xmath10 of morphisms from the object @xmath4 to the object @xmath11 for all @xmath12 , and a composition rule @xmath13 on the set @xmath10 such that @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the following two conditions hold .",

    "a lie 2-group is an example of a category in which the set of objects and the set of morphisms are both lie groups , and the composition of morphisms is a homomorphism .",
    "a trivial example of a lie 2-group is a lie group @xmath22 whose elements are now the objects , so that @xmath23 and each morphism takes one element to another is said to consist of the single object @xmath24 then the morphisms are all identity morphisms on @xmath24 ] , @xmath26 it is easy to see that in general the lie 2-group has two types of composition rules .",
    "let the objects be elements of @xmath27 and let the morphisms be elements of some other lie group @xmath28 then each morphism is some @xmath29 which takes @xmath30 to @xmath31 since this is a category , a morphism which takes @xmath30 to @xmath32 can be composed with another which takes @xmath32 to @xmath33 , and the resulting morphism takes @xmath30 to @xmath34 @xmath35 this composition rule makes no reference to the fact that @xmath36 is a group .    on the other hand ,",

    "this is an obvious generalization to categories of composing holonomies along infinitesimal line elements to get the holonomy of a finite curve . in the latter case",
    "the holonomy is the path ordered exponential of one - form connection or gauge field @xmath81 valued in the lie algebra of some group .",
    "the infinitesimal holonomy along a curve of length @xmath0 and tangent @xmath82 is @xmath83 to generalize this to bi - gons , two objects are needed , one for the holonomy along an edge , another for the morphism between edges .",
    "so let me introduce a one - form gauge field @xmath4 valued in the lie algebra of @xmath27 in order to compute the holonomy along an edge .",
    "in addition , let me also introduce a two - form field @xmath11 valued in the lie algebra of @xmath84    then the holonomy along an infinitesimal edge is of the form @xmath85 as before .",
    "i have written an integral because it does not make sense to represent the edges of bi - gons by tangent vectors .",
    "in fact , calculations become easier if a bi - gon is replaced by a triangle with the base being identified as the lower edge .",
    "then the ` integral ' is the sum of @xmath86 terms .",
    "now there is also a contribution from the infinitesimal surface , of the form @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the tensor characterizing the surface , and @xmath89 is its area .",
    "let me write this holonomy as @xmath90 in analogy with the one - form .",
    "if @xmath61 belongs to the top edge of the bi - gon , the morphism to the bottom edge takes @xmath61 to @xmath91 since each ` integral ' is actually an infinitesimal itself , their product can be ignored to the order of the area .",
    "further , @xmath4 and @xmath11 do not belong to the same lie algebra , but the homomorphism @xmath92 induces an obvious map so that @xmath11 can be brought to the same space as @xmath4 and added . just as curves are identified with group elements via a gauge field , this completes the identification of bi - gons with elements of a lie 2-group , via a pair of ` connection ' fields @xmath93",
    "one can take an alternative approach to constructing a surface holonomy , perhaps somewhat closer in philosophy to quantum field theories . in this approach",
    ", briefly described earlier in  @xcite , one introduces two one - form gauge fields , valued in the lie algebras of two groups @xmath38 and @xmath44 rather than a one - form and a two - form .",
    "then instead of surface holonomy , one considers the holonomy between identified points on nearby string configurations .",
    "any surface can be decomposed into a sum of infinitesimal squares , and thus the result of parallel transporting a field along an arbitrary path on any surface is unambiguous if and only if a certain integrability condition holds .",
    "further , it is possible to think of a field theoretic action on which this condition is imposed as a constraint .",
    "the corresponding lagrange multiplier field is a two - form in four dimensions ( a @xmath94-form in @xmath95 dimensions ) , leading to the usual gauge theories of a non - abelian two - form field .",
    "the composition of parallel transports around squares again follow the structure of a lie 2-group .    in this section parallel transport",
    "will always mean that of some field along a curve .",
    "consider an infinitesimal piece of a string , or flux tube , and another one infinitesimally close to the first one .",
    "these are the string configurations .",
    "the pieces are directed , and there is a notion of going continuously from one to the other .",

    "consider fields living on the string .",
    "parallel transport is always integrable in one dimension , so knowledge of the field at any point on the string determines the field at any other point .",
    "thus given a connection on the string , any field is well defined at every point of the string , and can be calculated in terms of its value at some ` zero point ' on the string .",
    "now consider an infinitesimally close string configuration .",
    "again parallel transport along the string determines the field at any point of the string , in terms of its value at the transported zero point .",
    "but now both the field and the connection ( to be used along the string ) must have been parallel transported to the new configuration from the previous one .",
    "this parallel transport between configurations could have been done by any connection , not necessarily the one transporting fields along the string .",
    "so let @xmath4 transport fields along the string , and let @xmath7 transport normal to the string .",
    "also let @xmath4 and @xmath7 belong to the lie algebras of @xmath38 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath7 can live in a subalgebra of the lie algebra to which @xmath4 belongs , but not the other way around , for fields living on the string must remain in the same algebra as @xmath4 for all configurations .",

    "any field is completely determined at all points of the string by parallel transport .",
    "if the string is moved to a nearby configuration , the field can be calculated at every point in the new configuration , without regard to how intermediate configurations were traversed , provided the integrability condition holds .",
    "then transporting fields around squares is unambiguous . and",
    "any surface can be broken up into infinitesimal squares , and thus a field can be unambiguously transported along paths on finite surfaces as well .",
    "the composition of the squares now follows the rules of composition in a lie 2-group , as is easy to see .",

    "this is then the object associated with an infinitesimal surface , and a product of these objects must be taken when composing infinitesimal surfaces .",
    "since there is no canonical ordering for surfaces , the infinitesimal surfaces may be composed in any order one likes , and the product of the corresponding holonomies must give a unique result irrespective of the order .",
    "clearly , this can happen only if the total holonomy is trivial or abelian , i.e. either @xmath126 or the sum lives in an abelian algebra .",
