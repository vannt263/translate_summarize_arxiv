    "in the last few decades , the ultra - cold atomic gases are one of the most intensively studied field in physics both experimentally and theoretically . advantage of the system of ultra - cold atoms is the strong - controllability and versatility . in particular ,",
    "the ultra - cold atoms in an optical lattice ( ol ) paves the new way for atomic quantum simulators to investigate the strongly - correlated systems in the condensed matter physics , the gauge theoretical models in the high - energy physics , etc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , academic theoretical models are realized by the atomic systems in an ol , and possible new phenomena / state in theoretical consideration are to be realized by the atomic systems . in this work , we shall study one of these models , i.e. , the haldane - bose - hubbard model ( hbhm ) in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the haldane mode of fermions in the honeycomb lattice was introduced as a model that has similar states at certain fillings to the state of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite .",
    "it exhibits non - trivial topological properties as a result of the complex hopping parameters .",
    "bosonic counterpart of the haldane model was introduced , and its ground - state phase and low - energy excitations were studied at unit filling @xcite . in the previous work , we studied the hbhm in the honeycomb lattice by means of the extended monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations , and showed that the system has a very rich phase diagram @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the effect of the complex next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping amplitude , which is now experimentally feasible by the recent advance in generating an artificial magnetic flux in the ol @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ordinary superfluid ( sf ) , some exotic sf , which is called chiral sf ( csf ) , forms for sufficiently large nnn hoppings , whereas the bosonic state of the qhe does not form .",
    "this result confirmed the previous works on the hbhm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we found that there appears a co - existing phase of the sf and csf if the pattern of the complex nnn hoppings is changed to that of the model called the modified haldane model @xcite . in the csf and sf+csf phases , topological excitations , vortices ,",
    "play an important role .",
    "we also studied the hbhm in the cylinder geometry and found that some exotic state forms near the boundary .    in this paper , we shall study a system of dipolar hard - core boson in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "effect of the dipole is expressed by the strong nn repulsion @xcite .",
    "we show that interplay of the nn repulsion and the complex nnn hopping generate a very rich phase diagram .",
    "this result partially stems from the quantum uncertainty relation between the particle number and the phase of the boson operator .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the hard - core hbhm and the slave - particle representation for the hard - core boson . for the complex nnn hopping , we consider two cases , one is that of the original hubbard model and the other is called the modified hubbard model . by integrating out the quantum fluctuations of the densities , we derive an effective low - energy model that is bounded from below . in sec .",
    "iii , by the mc simulation of the effective model , we study the phase diagram in detail .",

    "we have reached this conclusion by the calculations of the order parameters , which indicate that both the sf and csf exist in that phase .",
    "calculation of the specific heat suggests that both of the two phase transitions , sf@xmath181sf+csf and sf+csf@xmath181csf , are of second order .",

    "similar results were obtained for the case @xmath13 with @xmath127 . the snapshot and",
    "the correlation functions indicate that there exists a stable configuration in the sf+csf .",
    "in fact as the correlation functions @xmath176 and @xmath177 show , the boson phases rotate about @xmath78 for one lattice spacing in the x - direction and also about @xmath78 for two lattice spacings in the ( x+y)-direction in that configurations . from this observation , _",
    "the sf+csf state breaks the @xmath167 rotational symmetry and as a result it is threefold degenerate_. ( in the present calculation , the periodic boundary condition choses one out of the three states . )",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the energy of the above configuration as the particle density is homogeneous . in the case",
    "@xmath13 , the energy per site per unit density is @xmath182 . on the other hand in the case @xmath12 , for the a - sublattice @xmath182 , whereas for the b - sublattice @xmath183 .",
    "therefore average energy in the case @xmath12 is @xmath184 .",
    "this means that the observed sf+csf phase is stable in the parameter region with an intermediate magnitude of @xmath5 in the case @xmath13 , whereas not in the case @xmath12 .",
    "this explains the difference in the phase diagram of the two cases .",
    "for the case @xmath57 , the phase diagram has a rather complicated structure , and clear identification of some phase boundaries is difficult as the specific heat @xmath64 does not exhibit a consistent behavior for the measure in the various directions in the parameter space . obtained phase diagram is shown fig.[pdj1=23 ] , in which some of the phases are not definitive at present .",
    "this fact indicates that the system has a complicated phase structure because of the frustrations and some phase transitions are of strong first order .",
    "more elaborated numerical methods than the local up - date mc simulation is required to clarify the phase diagram .    .",
    ", width=151 ]",
    "in this paper , we have introduced the extended hbhm that describes the dipolar hard - core bosonic gases captured in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "in addition to the nn hopping and on - site repulsion , there exist the nnn - complex hopping and the nn repulsion . in order to study the case of strong - on - site repulsion , we employed the slave - particle representation and used the coherent - state path integral for the mc simulations . to suppress the multi - particle states in the path integral , we added the @xmath58-term to the action of the effective theory eq.([partitionf ] ) .",
    "we considered two cases for the nnn - complex hopping , the one is that in the original haldane model ( case @xmath12 ) and the other is that in the so - called modified haldane model ( case @xmath13 ) .",
    "we showed that the different phase diagrams appear depending on the nnn hopping .",
    "we first studied the simple case with the vanishing nnn hopping @xmath101 .",
    "there are four phases in the phase diagram including @xmath108-solid , which has the dw properties . in the weak quantum fluctuation case with @xmath57 , the ss forms in a small but finite parameter region in the @xmath108-solid .",
    "next we considered the weak nn hopping case , @xmath104 and @xmath185 .",
    "the phase diagram contains the csf as well as the phase , which we call the sl - csf . in the sl - csf ,",
    "there exist the diagonal sublattice dw order and the off - diagonal csf order .",
    "therefore , it is a new kind of the ss .",
    "we clarified the origin of the sl - csf , i .. e , the its existence stems from the uncertainty relation between the particle number and phase of the boson operator .",
    "furthermore for the case @xmath13 with the small quantum fluctuation @xmath57 , the phase diagram contains the coexisting phase of the sf and csf . in this phase , the boson phase has a certain specific stable configuration as exhibited in fig.[confgsf+csf ] .",
    "finally we studied the case of the relatively large @xmath186 , in which a large frustration exists . for the case @xmath124 , the stable phase diagrams are obtained for both the case @xmath12 and case @xmath13 , whereas for @xmath57 , the phase diagram is rather complicated and different phase boundaries are obtained by calculating the specific heat with increasing and decreasing the value of the chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that there exist strong first - order phase transition line in the phase diagram . the phase diagram in fig.[pdj1=23 ]",
    "was obtained by combining the calculations of the specific heat in both the directions .    in the present paper we considered the dipolar atoms by taking into account the nn repulsions .",
    "it is important to investigate how the nonlocal interaction of dipoles , which decays @xmath187 with the distance @xmath188 , influences the phase diagram .",
    "we investigated the effect of the nnn repulsion like @xmath189 for @xmath190 and found that the instability of @xmath108 solid in the phase diagram presented in fig.[j20 ] appears .",
    "detailed investigation of the effect of the nonlocal interactions is under study , and we hope that results will be reported in a future publication .",
    "as explained in sec.iii.b , the energy unit of this work is @xmath116 with @xmath191 in the present numerical study . from the typical value of the magnetic dipole of atoms",
    ", we can estimate the temperature @xmath53 . for @xmath192cr with @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the bohr magneton , and the lattice spacing of the optical lattice @xmath195 , @xmath196 nm , we have @xmath197nk by using @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum .",
    "therefore the temperature of the system is estimated as @xmath200nk .",
    "then the obtained phase diagrams can be regarded as the ground - state phase diagrams .",
    "it is interesting to study finite - temperature phase transitions of the sf and csf . in the present formalism , temperature of the system",
    "is controlled by varying the value of @xmath43 as it is related to @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath201 . in the previous work on some related models , we investigated the finite-@xmath53 transitions by this methods @xcite .",
    "rough estimation of the critical temperature of the sf , @xmath202 , can be obtained by the following simple consideration .",
    "we consider the case with @xmath101 for simplicity and decrease the value of @xmath43 . from eq.([partitionf ] ) , the system is regarded as a quasi - two - dimensional one , and the finite-@xmath53 phase transition of the sf is described by the o(2 ) spin order - disorder phase transition .",
    "the critical value of the phase transition @xmath203 is estimated as @xmath204 for @xmath108 ( i.e. , @xmath205 ) . from the phase diagram in fig.[j20 ] , the typical value of @xmath4 in _ the sf close to the @xmath108 mott insulator _ is @xmath206 .",
    "therefore @xmath207nk , which means @xmath208nk .",
    "we notice that this critical temperature is still low from the view point of the present feasible experimental setup .",
    "more detailed investigation of the finite-@xmath53 properties will be given in a future publication .",
    "it is interesting to study the present model with finite boundaries and investigate edge states . in the previous paper @xcite for the case @xmath209",
    ", we found that certain specific state forms near the boundaries .",
    "recently some related work studied edge states in gapped state of bosonic gases on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "another interesting system to be studied is the negative @xmath4 case of the hamiltonian in eq.([hbhm ] ) .",
    "this system is closely related to the frustrated quantum spin system , and an interesting ground - state was proposed @xcite .",
