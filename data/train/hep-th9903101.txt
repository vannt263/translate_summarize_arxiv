    "light front quantization has emerged as an important tool in the study of non - perturbative aspects of field theories [ 1 ] . however",
    "a major problem in this approach resides in the infrared behaviour of the continuum theory . recently",
    "this issue was clarified on the basis of a mathematically well defined procedure [ 2 ] . in the early attempts to deal with these infrared problems ,",
    "discretized light front quantization ( dlcq ) [ 3 ] has played an important role .",
    "the popularity of dlcq resides in the easy and conceptually simple treatment of the infrared regularisation : zero modes in the expansion of the fields were simply eliminated and later on understood as the lc - counterpart of the non - trivial ground state of equal - time ( et ) quantization .",
    "the study of critical phenomena in the framework of effective theories requires using a continuum version of the quantum field theory on the light front .",
    "indeed critical points , critical exponents etc ... are accessible only from a complete knowledge of the cut - off dependence of the critical mass , which can only be given by the continuum theory . in dlcq",
    "the limit of infinite periodicity length l can not be achieved in a straightforward manner without further insights both on the handling of zero modes and restoration of covariance and causality in the limiting process [ 4 ] .",
    "our approach [ 2 ] was to propose a genuine continuum treatment ( clcq ) in which fields are treated as operator valued distributions , thereby leading to a well defined handling of ultravioled and light cone induced infrared divergences and of their renormalization .",
    "we focussed in [ 2 ] on the comparison of the critical coupling in the lc and et - framework , showing that the continuum non - perturbative lc - approach is no more complex than usual perturbation theory in lowest order .",
    "the lc - critical coupling is in essential agreement with the rg - improved perturbative result at fourth order .",
    "here we want to report on a detailed comparison between dlcq and clcq treatments of important quantities like pauli - jordan commutator functions , which , due to necessary concision and lack of space , could not be treated therein .    in section 2",
    "we recall the dlcq and clcq fock expansion of the field operators and the resulting pauli - jordan field commutators .",
    "a detailed comparison of their behaviour in terms of the periodicity length @xmath1 ( e.g. intrinsic cut - off @xmath2 ) is made in section 3 where the issue of covariance and causality is also discussed in the limiting process @xmath3 .",
    "some conclusions and perpectives are presented in section 4 .",
    "dlcq was introduced [ 3 ] to resolve the zero mode problem .",
    "this mode is clearly isolated from other modes and its explicit treadtment results in a `` zero - mode constraint '' , the solution of which carries the non - perturbative aspects of the theory . in the particle sector ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed , @xmath1 being the periodicity length , leading to the usual fock expansion . restricting to @xmath4 dimension the particle sector field writes    @xmath5\\ ] ]    with @xmath6 = \\delta_{n , m } \\ \\ , \\ \\",
    "n , m \\geq 1 ; \\ ] ] and @xmath7 the clcq approach relies on the introduction of field operator - valued distributions defined with respect to @xmath8-test functions with compact support [ 5 ] .",
    "apart from formal considerations there exists a fondamental physical argument which demonstrates that it is compelling to treat the field amplitudes in the distributional sense in order to guarantee that the lc quantization procedure by itself is correct .",
    "due to the hyperbolic form of the lc - laplacian , initial field values have to the prescribed on characteristics , i.e. on @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in order to be able to transform this characteristic value problem into a problem with periodic boundary conditions , test functions @xmath11 have to be introduced with the property [ 6 ]    @xmath12    ( see eq . ( 3.20 ) of ref .",
    "[ 6 ] ) .",
    "this is exactly what happens automatically with the test functions defined below .",
    "condition ( 2.2 ) ensures , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] , that the field values on the characteristic @xmath10 become dependent quantities and , as a consequence , the quantization can be performed prescribing boundary values for @xmath9 at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the field can be expressed in a chart independent way as a surface integral over a manifold , thereby showing that the ultraviolet ( uv ) behaviour on the minkowski manifold dictates the uv and ir behaviour on the lc manifold .",
    "this is due to the regularisation properties of the test function which are automatically transfered from the first to the second case .    in this context",

    "its behaviour as a function of @xmath22 is discussed in [ 2 ] : the singular behaviour of @xmath23 in ( 2.2 ) is completely damped out by the behabiour of @xmath20 for @xmath24 , eliminating @xmath25 as an accumulation point .",
    "the ensuing renormalization is independent of the particular choice of @xmath26    we examine first the pauli jordan communator @xmath27 $ ] evaluated at @xmath9 . in the dlcq case on",

    "it is followed by an oscillatory fall - off with an average slope in @xmath44 , corresponding to the straight line of @xmath39 in dlcq . finally for large values of @xmath45",
    "remains oscillating around zero .",
    "hence in both cases the decay zone and the asymptotic region where @xmath46 is null or quasi - null , reflect the elimination of the zero mode , @xmath47 for dlcq and a halo around @xmath48 for clcq .",
    "however it is the presence of the uv - regularisation in clcq which is responsible for the smeared out rise near @xmath10 and small short wave length oscillations for small @xmath49 , at variance with dlcq where no such regularisation is present .",
    "clearly the n - summation can be arbitrarily cutt - off to deal with the uv - divergence but the approach to the continuum is not under control since the limiting procedure of infinite cutt - off and infinite periodicity length compatible with causality is not known . to discuss these points we examine now the commutator for space or time like separation .",

    "clearly for @xmath58 the limit @xmath15 can not be taken before the sum is carried out , as the sinus becomes ill - defined . as shown in appendix a this limit",
    "requires some care . using eq.(a.19 )",
    "one finds    @xmath59 j_0(m\\sqrt{x^+x^-})\\ ] ] @xmath60    hence the causal covariant expression is retrieved in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "however the marginal non causal term in @xmath61 in eq.(3.4 ) originates from the elimination of the zero mode in the infinite sum of eq.(3.2 ) ( for @xmath9 it is just @xmath62 , cf .",
    "eq(2.4 ) ) .",
    "its disappearance as @xmath15 indicates that in the continuum the infrared problems would remain at variance with clcq .",
    "thus in dlcq , @xmath1 has to be kept finite to achieve ir regularisation , at the expense of the appearance of a causality violating term of order @xmath63 . due to the regularisation properties of the test functions , the situation in clcq",
    "is far more satisfactory since the approach provides a well defined handling of uv and ir - divergences and of their renormalization .",
    "it has been shown that dynamical properties of lc - quantized scalar fields whose basic manifestation is in the pauli - jordan commutator function differ essentially if quantized in dlcq or in the continuum .",
    "dlcq on a finite interval yields causality violating terms being proportional to @xmath0 which come in addition to the frame independent result of the continuum theory .",
    "unfortunately this does not mean that the two versions coincide in the limit @xmath15 since in this limit the infrared regularisation of dlcq is lost .    to conclude we want to add a remark concerning the lc - lattice method introduced by destri and de vega [ 7 ] and elaborated by faddeev and coworkers [ 8 ] .",
    "this approach works on a lc - space - time lattice .",
    "the basic building blocks of field dynamics being causal transfer matrices between neighbouring points along light - like directions , problems with causality are avoided by construction in this discretization scheme .",
    "however the main argument in favour of this approach lies in the integrability properties in closest connection to those of the continuum .",
