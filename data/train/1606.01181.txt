    "while many stars were found to have a uniform period increase or decrease , several very intriguing cases of irregular period variations emerged in that study which are difficult to confront with theoretical expectations . in the present study",

    "we have used the available data in the literature since 1889 to build up a collection of as many times of maximum light of as many rrls as possible .",
    "some authors have already published times of maximum for some variables in m5 ( e.g. coutts 1971 , kukarkin & kukarkina 1971 ) , and in these cases we have adopted their values . for other authors , we have used the published photometric data to estimate the times of maximum .",
    "when necessary we have transformed julian days into heliocentric julian days .",
    "the complete collection of the times of maximum for each star is given in table [ tab : maxima ] , of which we show here just a small portion since the full table is only available in electronic form .",
    "to calculate the @xmath2 residuals as described above , we adopted for each studied variable the ephemerides given by af16 in their table 3 , and also listed in columns 3 and 4 of the present table [ variables ] .",

    "the period change can be represented as ,    @xmath35    where @xmath7 is the period change rate , and @xmath15 is the period at the epoch @xmath36 .",

    "we choose as a solution the one that produces the minimum dispersion of all the data sets phased simultaneously .",
    "since the penalty for increasing dispersion depends on the number of data , this method works best for variable stars with many observations , as it can otherwise find many local minima in the grid .",
    "we also note that when a solution with @xmath7=0 was among the 10 light curves with the least dispersion , we adopted this solution , corresponding to a simple period adjustment .",
    "a comparison and a discussion of the grid results with the ones from the @xmath2 method and those obtained by sz11 are given in @xmath12 [ sec : ind_stars ] .",
    "once a period change rate has been calculated , a natural test is to phase the light curve given the new ephemeris .",
    "for the sake of brevity we do not plot all the stars in table [ variables ] but show three representative examples in fig . [",
    "3examples ] . in the lower panels we show the light curve of all available data phases with a constant period ephemeris ( columns 3 and 4 in table [ variables ] ) .",
    "the upper panels show the light curve phase with the period change ephemerides ( columns 5 , 6 and 7 in table [ variables ] ) according to eqs . [ model ] , [ pdee ] and [ pdot ] .",
    "v12 is an rrab star for which the value of @xmath7 found by the @xmath2 and the grid method agree and the new phasing is correct . for the rrab v81 the grid method failed in finding an optimal solution .",
    "the @xmath2 approach finds a period change rate that phases well the available data . for the rrc v62",
    "the grid method did not converge and although the @xmath7 value from the @xmath2 approach improves the light curve phasing , it does not produce a perfectly phased light curve for all the data sets .",
    "we believe this is a reflection of the scatter and uncertainties inherent to the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "the grid method is very sensitive to the dispersion of the light curves involved in the calculation and hence in some instances we could not derive a convincing value of @xmath7 . in table [ variables ] we mark with a colon those values of @xmath7 that we consider to be particularly uncertain .      from the @xmath2 diagrams in fig.[diagsoc ]",
    "it is clear that the majority of the stars display either a linear or a quadratic distribution .",
    "the linear cases imply a constant period whose appropriate value is estimated by requiring that the slope of the line be zero .",
    "the refined ephemerides are given in columns 5 and 6 of table [ variables ] as @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see eq . [ model ] ) .",
    "these linear cases are all labelled @xmath45 in the last column of table [ variables ] and for homogeneity we calculated their @xmath7 by adjusting a parabola to the @xmath2 distribution ; as can be seen in all these cases @xmath7 is not significantly different from zero , hence we conclude that their period has remained constant for the last century . for a few stars whose apparent linear solution depends on a very low number of points , we have adopted @xmath7=0 , but have refrained from performing any further statistics ( e.g. v53 , v94 , v95 , v96 and v100 ) .",
    "similarly , some quadratic solutions based on a low number of epochs are listed in table [ variables ] as a reference but they are not highlighted since a solution can easily change by adopting a slightly different number of cycles , see the explicit examples of v85 and v97 in fig .",
    "[ diagsoc ] .",
    "the boldface highlighted values of @xmath7 in table [ variables ] are our recommended values as they are better estimated and produce a good phasing of the combined light curves . the uncertainties given in parentheses after the @xmath46 results were calculated from the uncertainty of coefficient @xmath47 following eq .",
    "[ beta_0 ] and neglecting the period uncertainty .",
    "the resulting @xmath42 and @xmath7 from the grid approach ( @xmath12 [ pbeta ] ) are listed in column 8 .",
    "the @xmath3 method is a useful independent check on the values found with the @xmath46 method .",
    "however , because it relies on the comparison of the string length of phased light curves , rather than on a standard goodness - of - fit statistic , it is difficult to obtain rigorous estimates of the uncertainties associated with the values of @xmath7 yielded by the @xmath3 method .",
    "such estimates are possible , but require detailed monte carlo simulations that are beyond the scope of this study .    except for a few cases with an unclear solution , mostly due to the scarcity of times of maximum light or , in three cases ( v14 , v28 and v35 ) due to an irregular distribution of the @xmath2 residuals , all the stars studied here show either a smooth period change or the period appears to be constant over the last century .",
    "we found three cases where the @xmath2 residuals are best represented by a cubic equation , implying a secular variation of the period change rate @xmath7 ( v8 , v15 and v80 ) .",
    "we do not confirm the irregular period variations reported by sz11 in at least one third of the stars studied by both teams .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that in long time baseline data sets and for stars with short periods , like rrls , the @xmath2 residuals can easily exceed one or two cycles and then the number of cycles might be miscounted .",
    "we have paid special attention to the proper counting of cycles elapsed since the reference epoch in the adopted ephemerides and we could always , or almost always , make the residuals to be consistent with a linear or a parabolic distribution , which in turn are easier to understand on evolutionary grounds than the stochastic oscillations in the @xmath2 diagrams .    in what follows we compare the resulting values of @xmath7 obtained from the two approaches described in @xmath12 [ omc ] and @xmath12 [ pbeta ] , and subsequently with the results of sz11 . finally , we will highlight and comment on some individual peculiar cases .      in fig .",
    "[ bocbpb ] the @xmath7 values from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 approaches are compared .",
    "we were able to estimate @xmath7 by the two independent methods for 38 stars .",
    "the agreement of the two methods is generally very good , within 0.05 d  myr@xmath41 for 32 stars , between 0.08 and 0.13 d  myr@xmath41 for 3 stars , and there are 3 outliers ; v8 in the plot plus v4 and v25 not shown in the figure . for 26 stars",
    "the @xmath2 diagrams suggest a constant period which could be refined by fitting a straight line and then calculating @xmath23 ( see eq .",

    "depending on the cycle counting , especially in data from around the 1960 s , one could interpret the @xmath2 diagram as having a constant period , in agreement with the result of sz11 , or as having an abrupt period change at that time ( gray and black dots in fig .",

    "it has been pointed out in @xmath12 [ oc - pb ] that data on these stars are sparse , and that they show either prominent blazhko modulations and/or a bump near the maximum light ( af16 ) , hence it is difficult to be conclusive on their secular period behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ examples ] the light curves phased with the two competing results are displayed . in spite that one of the solutions produces a reasonable phasing , we warn that these cases should be considered as marginal until more data become available .",
    "it is clear that as stars evolve across the instability strip , their pulsation period should increase if evolution is to the red and decrease if evolution is to the blue .",
    "however , it is also understood now that evolution is most likely not the only reason for period variations and stochastic variations have also been proposed ( balazs - detre & detre 1965 ) . in fact several authors have found irregular and complicated @xmath2 diagrams ( e.g. sz11 , jurcsik et al .",
    "2001 ) , which indeed would be difficult to reconcile with evolution exclusively .",
    "sweigart & renzini ( 1979 ) suggested that mixing events in the core of a star at the hb may alter the hydrostatic structure and pulsation period and that a small transfer of helium inwards at the semiconvective zone , near the convective core boundary , can be responsible for period changes , either positive , negative , or irregular .",
    "however , we note that at least in the case of m5 , there is no need to claim for irregular period variations since an improper counting of cycles , particularly in long time baseline sets of times of maximum light , may be responsible for those apparent irregularities , with the probable exception of v14 and v35",
    ".    it has been in the interest of several authors in the past to infer evolutionary properties accross the instability strip by searching for preferential directions of evolution as indicated by the secular period changes in rrls .",
    "a preferential period variation through the is , in either direction , seems however to be improbable .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "growing evidence of several stellar populations coexisting in a given globular cluster have been put forward in recent years , both theoretically and observationally as well as on spectroscopic ( carretta et al . 2010 ; gratton et al . 2012 ) and photometric ( e.g. piotto et al . 2007 , sbordone et al .",
    "2011 , alonso - garca et al .",

    "the presence of multiple populations , and their role in the structure of the is at the horizontal branch , have recently been discussed by jang et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and jang & lee ( 2015 ) in connection with the origin of the oosterhoff types dichotomy .",
    "they conclude that rrab - type stars in ooii clusters belong to a second generation with the helium abundance @xmath57 slightly increased and carbon , nitrogen , and oxigen ( cno ) noticeably enhanced which produce more luminous and redder stars , therefore with longer periods ; in ooi clusters the rrab stars are members of the less luminous first generation . however , this scenario , that aims to explain the oosterhoff dichotomy , does not account for the non - preferential distribution of increasing and decreasing periods in a given globular cluster .",
    "thorough and extensive investigations on the secular period change rates , @xmath7 , in a few clusters have been carried out and the averages are not significantly different from zero ; for m3 corwin & carney ( 2001 ) found an overall average of + 0.004@xmath580.335 for 37 rrls and also jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found a small positive value of about + 0.01 for some 54 rrls . for m15",
    "silbermann & smith ( 1995 ) found an average of + 0.06@xmath580.24 for 27 rrls and excluding the double mode or rrd pulsators also smith & wesselink ( 1977 ) found an average of + 0.11@xmath580.36 ; for ngc 4590 kains et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found an average of + 0.02@xmath580.57 for 14 stars ; ngc 7006 wehlau , slawson & nemec ( 1999 ) found + 0.03@xmath580.14 for stars ; for m28 wehlau et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found -0.06@xmath580.29 for 11 stars ; for m14 wehlau & froelich ( 1994 ) found + 0.04@xmath580.43 for 35 stars .",
    "the case with the largest positive average @xmath7 is @xmath59 cen ( jurcsik et al .",
    "2001 their table 6 ) for which we calculate + 0.170@xmath580.561 .",
    "all the above cited uncertainties correspond to the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "the case of ic4499 ( kunder et al .",
    "2011 ) comes a bit as a surprise since the average + 0.29@xmath580.60 from 39 stars ( their table 1 without three extreme cases ) is found despite of not having a very blue hb ( @xmath60=+0.11 ) .",
    "also , in all the above studies no significant differences were found in the average values of @xmath7 for the population of rrab and rrc stars .    on theoretical grounds ,",
    "lee ( 1991 ) demonstrated that in globular clusters with blue hb morphologies , the average rate of period change @xmath7 would become increasingly large but it will be small on average for the rrls in globular clusters with reddest hb s ( see his figure 4 ) .",
    "an updated version of this correlation , provided by catelan & smith ( 2015 ) ( their figure 6.16 ) , supplemented with new theoretical calculations and more empirical results confirms the trend .",
    "however , on empirical grounds the trend of increasing @xmath7 with very blue hb types is driven primarily by @xmath59 cen [ a peculiar cluster with a large star - to - star spread of heavy element abundances as pointed out by catelan & smith ( 2015 ) and valcarce & catelan ( 2011 ) ] , but also by m3 and m28 , and ( to some extent ) m22 .",
    "further studies of secular period variations in globular cluters with ( very ) blue hb types are strongly encouraged , as this would enable a better investigation of the possible connection between period change rates and evolution along the hb .    for m5 several authors",
    "have concluded that the averages of period changes do not show significantly preferential increasing or decreasing periods ( e.g. reid 1996 , coutts & sawyer - hogg 1969 , sz11 ) .",
    "sz11 found an overall average of -0.006@xmath580.162 for 55 stars . from our table",
    "[ variables ] we can see that out of the 76 stars studied , constant periods are evident in 18 rrab and 8 rrc while parabolic or cubic secular variations are observed in 37 rrab and 9 rrc stars . of the remaining four stars , in one ( v93 ) the solution depends on one point , and",
    "the other three are irregular ( v14 , v28 and v35 ) . thus",
    ", 66% of the studied population has secular period variations , and 34% shows periods that seem to have been stable over the last century . according to the @xmath2 results in table [ variables ] , we see that among the rrab stars 23 have @xmath61 , 15 have @xmath62 and 19 have @xmath49 for a total average + 0.026@xmath580.210 . for the rrc stars",
    "6 have @xmath63 , 4 @xmath62 and 8 @xmath49 for an average of + 0.023@xmath580.073 .",
    "thus , we find small positive average values for @xmath7 in the rrls of m5 and there seems to be a small surplus of rrab stars with increasing periods .",
    "furthermore , while it is true that other sources of period change noise , such as stochastic processes , and/or with mixing events in the stellar core , are superposed on evolutionary period variations , it is of fundamental interest to isolate stars with evidence that suggests they are in an advanced stage of evolution , and to determine whether they are subject of systematic larger positive period change rates .",
    "based on their distribution on the log @xmath64 plane , af16 identified a dozen rrab stars likely to be in an advanced evolutionary stage and found them consistently more luminous than the rest of the rrls .",
    "these are the stars v9 , v11 , v16 , v17 , v20 , v26 , v39 , v45 , v77 , v86 , v87 and v90 and are ploted in figs .",
    "[ bocbpb ] and [ bvsb ] with red colour .",
    "we can see that the agreement between the values of @xmath7 found in this work and those of sz11 is very good , except for v17 and v86 that were not included by sz11 .",
    "also we note from figs .",
    "[ bocbpb ] and [ bvsb ] , that there is a clear trend for positive values of @xmath7 in these stars , as expected if they are indeed advanced in their evolution towards the agb . among these evolved stars ,",
    "three stand out for their large positive @xmath7 , v77 ( + 0.340 d  myr@xmath41 ) , v87 ( + 0.369 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v90 ( + 0.114 d  myr@xmath41 ) ( confirmed by the grid results ) , and are the clearest cases of evolved stars displaying large increasing period rates .",
    "we conclude that in this group of rrab stars their period increase rate and their advanced evolutionary stage are connected .    on the other hand , the stars with most extreme positive values of @xmath7 , v8 ( + 0.474 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v25 ( + 0.933 d  myr@xmath41 )",
    "were not noticed by af16 as probable evolved stars , and although v25 has been identified as being a blended star ( arellano ferro et al .",
    "2015a ) , a circumstance that should not affect the @xmath2 diagram , the large period increase rates are well established .",
    "other stars with large positive values of @xmath7 and without other evidences of advanced evolution are v7 ( + 0.474 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v61 ( + 0.266 d  myr@xmath41 ) .",
    "the origin of the period change in these stars may be more connected with stochastic processes and/or with mixing events in the stellar core as described above .",
    "the existence of large negative values of @xmath7 should not be surprising .",
    "depending on the mass and chemical composition on the zahb , the evolutionary tracks can have blue loops into the is ( e.g. caputo et al .",
    "1978 ; jang & lee 2015 ) and enhancement of @xmath57 and cno also causes the evolutionary tracks to appear redder and more luminous ( jang & lee 2015 ) making stars with negative @xmath7 to appear as more evolved .",
    "we remind that , as discussed by silva aguirre et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , approximately 22% of the pre - zahb stars may fall in the is and present rr lyrae - like pulsations and about 76% of them are predicted to have negative @xmath7 values of the order of @xmath65 d  myr@xmath41 although more extreme values , say inferior than @xmath66 d  myr@xmath41 , are possible .    employing the grid of hb evolutionary tracks of dorman ( 1992 ) for [ fe / h]=@xmath67 and masses of 0.60 to 0.66 @xmath68 , jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculated period change rates accross the is to be between -0.026 and + 0.745 d  myr@xmath41 .",
    "these values are in agreement with what we calculated for the majority of the rrls stars in m5 . however , in cases with extreme values of positive or negative @xmath7 , evolution may play only a partial role in the period secular variations , except probably in stars with independent evidence that they are more advanced on their way to the agb .",
    "there are examples in the literature of rrls with very large period change rates which would be difficult to explain exclusively by evolutionary arguments ; the rrab v104 ( -19.796 d  myr@xmath41 ) , the rrc stars v160 ( -10.18 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v123 ( + 5.474 d  myr@xmath41 ) and the rr lyrae - like stars v48 ( + 15.428 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v92 ( + 13.941 d /myr ) in @xmath59 cen ( jurcsik et al . 2001 ) ; the rrab star v29 ( -17.8 d  myr@xmath41 ) in ngc 6981 ( bramich et al .",
    "2016 ) ; the rrc stars v14 ( + 8.26 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v18 ( + 4.0 d  myr@xmath41 ) in ngc 6333 ( arellano ferro et al .",
    "in m5 we find v4 ( 2.31 d  myr@xmath41 ) and v25 ( 0.93 d  myr@xmath41 ) .",
    "other processes must be at play in these cases .",
    "it is thus clear that the rr lyrae instability strip can be populated by stars of different ages , chemical compositions and evolving both to the blue or to the red .",
    "this assertion , combined with the fact that stochastic processes related to the semiconvention zone can also produce variations in the pulsation period , indicate that no systematics trends in the period changes in a given cluster are to be found .",
    "exceptions may be those globular clusters with very blue hb structures , according to theoretical predictions ( lee 1991 , catelan & smith 2015 ) , and efforts towards detail period change analysis in these clusters should be encouraged . after these considerations it is striking to note , however , that there are stars that manage to mantain a stable period for over a hundred years : in m5 we identified 26 of them in the sample of 76 stars studied , i.e. 34% , and that a few stars in this cluster with evidence of advanced evolution indeed show large positive period change rates .",
    "pulsation period changes have been analysed via the times of maximum light for 76 rr lyrae stars in m5 .",
    "archival data were collected from the literature that span up to 118 years for many of the sample stars .",
    "no signs of irregular or stochastic variations were found in the large majority of the stars but instead they have either a remarkably stable period or a secular period change that can be represented by a parabolic @xmath2 diagram . the only exceptions are v14 , v28 and v35 for which their @xmath2 diagrams are irregular and we were unable to find a more simple solution .",
    "the collection of times of maximum assembled in this work is published in electronic format for the sake of possible future analyses .",
    "we have also used an alternative method first introduced by kains et al .",
    "( 2015 ) in which a grid @xmath3 is built to allow the selection of the solution that minimizes the dispersion in the phased light curve .",
    "the values of @xmath7 found by the grid method and those from the @xmath2 approach give very consistent results , generally within @xmath580.05 d  myr@xmath41 .",
    "also the comparison with the values of @xmath7 of sz11 for the stars in common is very good .",
    "other than stellar evolution , the existence of stochastic effects influencing the structure of the star in the is may produce variations of the pulsational period .",
    "this fact , and the existence of multiple stellar generations with a range in chemical compositions in the cluster , make that evolution accross the is occurs both to the red and to the blue and that neither increasing nor decreasing periods are significantly more frequent .",
    "this scenario is consistent with theoretical expectations for globular clusters without blue hb morphologies .",
    "most likely the observed period variations are not the result of a single cause .",
    "nevertheless , in m5 we have been able to isolate a group of likely evolved stars that show systematically positive , and in some cases large , rates of period change .",
