    "ferdinand magellan s expedition was the first that completed the circumnavigation of our globe during 1519 - 1522 , after discovering the _ strait of magellan _ between the atlantic and pacific ocean in search for a westward route to the `` spice islands '' ( indonesia ) , and thus gave us a first @xmath7 view of our planet earth .",
    "five centuries later , nasa has sent two spacecraft of the stereo mission on circumsolar orbits , which reached in 2011 vantage points on opposite sides of the sun that give us a first @xmath7 view of our central star .",
    "both discovery missions are of similar importance for geographic and heliographic charting , and the scientific results of both missions rely on geometric triangulation .",
    "the twin stereo / a(head ) and b(ehind ) spacecraft ( kaiser et al .",
    "2008 ) , launched on 2006 october 26 , started to separate at end of january 2007 by a lunar swingby and became injected into a heliocentric orbit , one propagating `` ahead '' and the other `` behind '' the earth , increasing the spacecraft separation angle ( measured from sun center ) progressively by about @xmath8 per year .",
    "the two spacecraft reached the largest separation angle of @xmath9 on 2011 february 6 .",
    "a stereo secchi cor1-a / b intercalibration was executed at @xmath9 separation ( thompson et al .",
    "thus , we are now in the possession of imaging data from the two stereo / euvi instruments ( howard et al .  2008 ; wlser et al .",
    "2004 ) that cover the whole range from smallest to largest stereoscopic angles and can evaluate the entire angular range over which stereoscopic triangulation is feasible .",
    "it was anticipated that small angles in the order of @xmath10 should be most favorable , similar to the stereoscopic depth perception by eye , while large stereoscopic angles that are provided in the later phase of the mission would be more suitable for tomographic 3d reconstruction .",
    "the first stereoscopic triangulations using the stereo spacecraft have been performed for coronal loops in active regions , observed on 2007 may 9 with a separation angle of @xmath11 ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2008 ) and observed on 2007 june 8 with @xmath12 ( feng et al .",
    "further stereoscopic triangulations have been applied to oscillating loops observed on 2007 june 26 with a stereoscopic angle of @xmath13 ( aschwanden 2009 ) , to polar plumes observed on 2007 apr 7 with @xmath14 ( feng et al .",
    "2009 ) , to an erupting filament observed on 2007 may 19 with @xmath15 ( liewer et al .",
    "2009 ) , to an erupting prominence observed on 2007 may 9 with @xmath16 ( bemporad 2009 ) , and to a rotating , erupting , quiescent polar crown prominence observed on 2007 june 5 - 6 with @xmath17 ( thompson 2011 ) .",
    "thus , all published stereoscopic triangulations have been performed within a typical ( small ) stereoscopic angular range of @xmath18 , as it was available during the initial first months of the stereo mission .",
    "the largest stereoscopic angle used for triangualtion of coronal loops was used for active region 10978 , observed on 2007 december 11 , with a spacecraft separation of @xmath19 ( aschwanden and sandman 2010 ; sandman and aschwanden 2011 ) , which produced results with similar accuracy as those obtained from smaller stereoscopic angles .",
    "so there exists also an intermediate rangle of aspect angles that can be used for stereoscopic triangulation .    however , nothing is known whether stereoscopy is also feasible at large angles , say in the range of @xmath20 , and how the accuracy of 3d reconstruction depends on the aspect angle , in which range the stereoscopic correspondence problem is intractable , and whether stereoscopy at a maximum angle near @xmath21 is equally feasible as for @xmath22 for optically thin structures ( as it is the case in soft x - ray and euv wavelengths ) , due to the @xmath9 symmetry of line - of - sight intersections . in this study",
    "we are going to explore stereoscopic triangulation of coronal loops in the entire range of @xmath23 and quantify the accuracy and quality of the results as a function of the aspect angle .",
    "observations and data analysis are reported in section 2 , while a discussion of the results is given in section 3 , with conclusions in section 4 .     indicated approximately at the beginning of the years , ranging from @xmath24 in april 2007 to @xmath25 in february 2011.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "we select stereo observations at spacecraft separation angles with increments of @xmath26 over the range of @xmath27 to @xmath25 , which corresponds to time intervals of about a year during the past mission lifetime 20072011 .",
    "a geometric sketch of the spacecraft positions stereo / a+b relative to the earth - sun axis is shown in fig .",
    "1 . additional constraints in the selection are : ( i ) the presence of a relatively large prominent active region ; ( ii ) a position in the field - of - view of both spacecraft ( since the mutual coverage overlap drops progressively from @xmath9 initially to @xmath28 during the first 4 years of the mission ) ; ( iii ) a time near the central meridian passage of an active region viewed from earth ( to minimize confusion by foreshortening ) ; and ( iii ) the availability of both stereo / euvi / a+b and calibrated soho / mdi data .",
    "the selection of 5 datasets is listed in table 1 , which includes the following active regions : ( 1 ) noaa 10953 observed on 2007 april 30 ( also described in derosa et al .  2009 ; sandman et al .",

    "this selection covers spacecraft separation angles of @xmath29 , and @xmath1 .    for each of the 5 datasets we stacked the images during a time interval of 2030 minutes in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the euvi images .",
    "during the first 3 years ( 2006 - 2008 ) the nominal cadence of 171   images was 150 s , which yields 8 stacked images per 20 minute interval . later in the mission",
    ", the highest cadence was chosen for the 195   wavelength , but dropped from 150 s to 300 s due to the reduced telemetry rate at larger spacecraft distances , which yields 612 stacked images per 30 minute interval . in one case ( 2010 nov 23 ) the cadence in euvi / a and b are not equal , either due to data loss or different telemetry priorities ( see time intervals and number of stacked images in table 1 ) .",
    "the solar rotation during the time interval of stacked image sequences was removed to first order by shifting the images by an amount corresponding to the rotation rate at the extracted subimage centers .",
    ".data selection of 5 active regions observed with stereo / euvi and soho / mdi .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , > , > \" , ]     the first case is active region noaa 10953 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , where we display the same 100 loop segments that have been triangulated in an earlier study ( aschwanden and sandman 2010 ) .",
    "the spacecraft separation angle is @xmath30 and the almost identical direction of the line - of - sights of both stereo / a and b spacecraft makes it easy to identify the corresponding loops in a and b , and thus the triangulation is very reliable .",
    "note that the height range where discernable loops can be traced in the highpass - filtered images is about @xmath31 solar radii ( or @xmath32 mm ) , which is commensurable with the hydrostatic density scale height expected for a temperature of @xmath33 mk that corresponds to the peak sensitivity of the euvi 171   filter .",
    "this is particularly well seen in the side view shown in the bottom left panel in fig .  2 .",
    "a measurement of the mean misalignment angle averaged over 10 positions of the 100 reconstructed loops with the local magnetic potential field shows a value of @xmath34 ( table 2 ) , similar to earlier work ( aschwanden and sandman 2010 ; sandman and aschwanden 2011 ) .",
    "however , forward - fitting of a nonlinear force - free field model reduces the misalignment to @xmath35 , which implies that this active region is slightly nonpotential .",
    "the remaining misalignment is attributed to at least two reasons , partially to inadequate parameterization of the force - free field model , and partially to stereoscopic measurement errors @xmath36 due to misidentified loop correspondences and limited spatial resolution .",
    "an empirical estimate of the stereoscopic error was devised in aschwanden and sandman ( 2010 ) , based on the statistical non - parallelity of closely - spaced triangulated loop 3d trajectories , which yielded for this case a value of @xmath37 . in summary",
    ", we find that this active region is very suitable for stereoscopy , allows to discern a large number ( 100 ) of loops , minimizes the stereoscopic correspondence problem due to the small ( @xmath30 ) spacecraft separation angle , displays a moderate misalignment angle and stereoscopic measurement error ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this well - defined case will serve as a reference for stereoscopy at larger angles .    .",

    "3 ) , observed on 2007 dec 11 with a spacecraft separation angle of @xmath19 .",
    "note that the views from euvi / a and b appear already to be significantly different with regard to the orientation of the triangulated loops , as seen from a distinctly different aspect angle .",
    "a set of 52 coronal loops were stereoscopically triangulated in this region ( aschwanden and sandman 2010 ) , a mean misalignment angle of @xmath41 is found for a potential field model , and a reduced value of @xmath42 is found for the force - free model ( table 2 ) , while a stereoscopic error of @xmath43 is estimated ( aschwanden and sandman 2010 ) .",
    "thus , the quality of stereoscopic triangulation ( as well as the degree of non - potentiality ) is similar to the first active region , although we performed stereoscopy with a 7 times larger spacecraft separation angle ( @xmath19 ) than before ( @xmath30 ) . apparently , stereoscopy is still easy at such angles , partially helped by the fact that the active region is located near the central meridian ( @xmath44 ) for both spacecraft , which provides an unobstructed view from top down , so that the peripheral loops of the active region do not overarch the core of the active region , where the bright reticulated moss pattern ( berger et al .",
    "1999 ) makes it almost impossible to discern faint loops in the highpass - filtered images .",
    "the top - down view provides also an optimum aspect angle to disentangle closely - spaced loops , which is an important criterion in the stereosopic correspondence identification .",
    "the third case is active region noaa 11010 ( fig",
    ".  4 ) , observed on 2009 jan 12 with a near - orthogonal spacecraft separation angle of @xmath45 . due to the quadrature of the spacecraft , only a sector of @xmath46 east and west of the central meridian ( viewed from earth )",
    "is jointly visible by both spacecraft .",
    "this particular active region is seen at a @xmath8 angle by both stereo / a and stereo / b .",
    "this symmetric view is the optimum condition to discern a large number of inclined loop segments and to identify the stereoscopic correspondence .",
    "we triangulate some 20 loop segments , which appear almost mirrored in the stereo / a and b image due to the east - west symmetry of the magnetic dipole .",
    "a mean misalignment angle of @xmath47 with the potential field model is found , and a reduced value of @xmath48 with the force - free field model .",
    "an estimate of the statistical ( non - parallelity ) stereoscopic error is not possible due to the small number of triangulated loops .",
    "thus , we conclude that stereoscopy is still possible in quadrature . mathematically , the orthogonal projections should yield the most accurate 3d coordinates of a curvi - linear structure , but in practice , confusion of multiple structures with near - aligned projections can cause a disentangling problem in the stereoscopic correspondence identification at this intermediate angle .    the fourth case is active region noaa 11032 ( fig",
    ".  5 ) , observed on 2009 nov 21 with a large spacecraft separation angle of @xmath49 .",
    "stereo / a sees the active region near the east limb from an almost side - on perspective , while stereo / b sees a similar mirror image near the west limb , where confusion near the limb makes the stereoscopic correspondence identification more difficult .",
    "we trace some 15 loop segments , but do not succeed in pinning down a larger number of loops , partially because this active region is small and does not exhibit numerous bright loops , and partially because of increasing confusion problems near the limb .",
    "we searched for larger active regions over several months around this time , but were not successful due to a dearth of solar activity during this time .",
    "we find a misalignment angle of @xmath50 for the potential field , and @xmath51 for the force - free field model , which is still comparable with the previous active regions triangulated at smaller sterescopic angles .",
    "thus , stereoscopy seems to be still feasible at such large stereoscopic angles .",
    "the last case is active region noaa 11127 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , observed on 2010 nov 23 with a very large spacecraft separation angle of @xmath52 , only two months before the two stereo spacecraft pass the largest separation point . at this point , the common field - of - view that is overlapping from stereo / a and b is only the central meridian zone seen from earth ( or the opposite meridian behind the sun ) .",
    "stereo / a observes active region noaa 11127 at its east limb , while stereo / b sees it at its west limb , so both spacecraft see only the vertical structure of the active region from a side view ( see fig .  6 top ) .",
    "this particular configuration is very unfavorable for stereoscopy .",
    "although the vertical structure in altitude can be measured very accurately , the uncertainty in horizontal direction in longitude is very large and suffers moreover the sign ambiguity of positive or negative longitude difference with respect to the limb seen from earth .",
    "consequently , we have reliable information on the altitude and latitude of loops , while the longitude is essentially ill - defined . in order to reduce the large scatter in the measurement of @xmath53-coordinates along a loop , introduced by the near - infinite amplification of parallax uncertainties tangentially at the limb , we restrict the general solution of geometric 3d triangulation to planar loops , by applying a linear regression fit of the @xmath54 coordinates .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "6 shows that we can trace some ( 5 ) loops in the plane of the sky and have no problem in identifying the stereoscopic counterparts in both stereo / a and b images , but the stereoscopic triangulation is ill - defined at this singularity of the sign change in the parallax effect .",
    "the misalignment between the three loop directions and the potential field is @xmath55 , and for the force - free field model is @xmath56 , which indicates that the orientation of the loop planes is less reliably determined .",
    "stereoscopic triangulation brakes down at this singularity of separation angles at @xmath57 , although the stereoscopic correspondence problem is very much reduced for the `` mirror images '' , similar to the near - identical images at small separation angles @xmath58 .",
    "we are discussing now the pro s and con s of stereoscopy at small and large aspect angles , which includes quantitative estimates of the formal error of stereoscopic triangulation ( section 3.1 ) , the stereoscopic correspondence and confusion problem ( section 3.2 ) , and the statistical probability of stereoscopable active regions during the full duration of the stereo mission ( section 3.3 ) , all as a function of the stereoscopic aspect angle ( or spacecraft separation angle @xmath59 in the case of the stereo mission ) .",
    "stereoscopic triangulation involves a parallax angle around the normal of the epipolar plane . for the stereo mission",
    ", the epipolar plane intersects the sun center and the two spacecraft a and b positions , which are separated mostly in east - west direction .",
    "no parallax effect occurs when the loop axis coincides with the epipolar plane , i.e. , when the loop axis points in east - west direction .",
    "thus , the accuracy of stereoscopic triangulation depends most sensitively on this orientation angle @xmath60 , which we define as the angle between the loop direction and the normal of the epipolar plane ( i.e. , approximately the y - axis of a solar image in north - south direction ) .",
    "if the position of a loop centroid can be determined with an accuracy of a half pixel size @xmath61 , the dependence of the stereoscopic error on the orientation angle @xmath60 is then ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2008 ) , @xmath62 thus , for a highly inclined loop that has an eastern and western footpoint at the same latitude , the stereoscopic error is minimal near the loop footpoints ( pointing in north - south direction ) and at maximum near the loop apex ( pointing in east - west direction ) .",
    "in addition , the accuracy of stereoscopic triangulation depends also on the aspect angle ( or spacecraft separation angle @xmath59 ) , which can be quantified with an error trapezoid as shown in fig .",
    "if the half separation angle @xmath63 is defined symmetrically to the earth - sun axis ( z - axis ) , the uncertainty in z - direction is @xmath64 and is in the x - direction ( in the epipolar plane ) @xmath65/2)$ ] . including also a half pixel - size error @xmath66 in the y - direction",
    ", we have then a combined error for the 3d position of a triangulated point as , @xmath67 }   } } \\ .\\ ] ] this positional error is symmetric for small @xmath59 and large stereoscopic angles @xmath68 , and has a minimum at an orthogonal angle of @xmath69 .",
    "the error is largest in z - direction for small spacecraft separation angles , while it is largest in x - direction for separation angles near @xmath70 .    .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath71 in x - direction and spacecraft in z - direction depend on the pixel width @xmath72 and half aspect angle @xmath63.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to compare the relative importance of the two discussed sources of errors we can evaluate the parameters that increase the individual errors by a factor of two .",
    "this is obtained when the orientation angle of a loop segment ( with respect to the east - west direction ) increases from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , or if the spacecraft separation angle changes from the optimum angle @xmath75 to @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 , respectively ) . if stereoscopy at small angles of @xmath78 is attempted , the positional error is about ten - fold ( corresponding to @xmath79 ) , compared with the optimum angle at @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath80 ) . for stereo / euvi with a pixel size of @xmath81 mm , this amounts to an accuracy range of @xmath82 mm .",
    "the previous considerations are valid for isolated loops that can be unambiguously disentangled in an active region , in both the stereo / a and b images .",
    "however , this is rarely the case . in crowded parts of active regions , the correspondence of a particular loop in image",
    "a with the identical loop in image b can often not properly be identified .",
    "we call this confusion problem also the _ stereoscopic correspondence problem _ , which appears in every stereoscopic tie - point triangulation method . in order to quantify this source of error",
    ", we have to consider the area density of loops and their relative orientation . a top - down view of an active region , e.g. , as seen for small stereoscopic angles by both spacecraft for an active region near disk center ( e.g. , fig .",
    "2 ) , generally allows a better separation of individual loops , because only the lowest density scale height is detected ( due to hydrostatic gravitational stratification ) , and neighbored loop segments do not obstruct each other due to the foreshortening projection effect near the footpoints .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "every active region seen near the limb , shows many loops at different longitudes , but at similar latitudes , cospatially on top of each other , which represents the most severe confusion problem .",
    "thus , we can essentially quantify the degree of confusion by the loop number density per pixel , which approximately scales with the inverse cosine - function of the center - to - limb angle due to foreshortening .",
    "in other words , we can define a quality factor @xmath83 for identifying the stereoscopic correspondence @xmath84 of properly disentangled coronal loops , which drops from @xmath85 at disk center to @xmath86 at the limb , where @xmath87 is the center - to - limb angle measured from sun center , @xmath88     of stereoscopic triangulation as a function of the spacecraft separation angle @xmath59 , which is a function of the accuracy @xmath89 of triangulated stereoscopic positions and the stereoscopic correspondence quality factor @xmath84 .",
    "the best quality ( within a factor of 2 ) occurs in the range of @xmath90.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the orbits of the stereo mission reduce the overlapping area on the solar surface that can be jointly viewed by both spacecraft a and b linearly with increasing spacecraft separation angle , so that the center - to - limb distance @xmath87 of an active region located on the central meridian ( viewed from earth ) is related to the spacecraft separation angle by @xmath91 increasing linearly with the separation angle from @xmath92 at the beginning of the mission to @xmath93 at maximum spacecraft separation angle .",
    "the location of an active region at the central meridian provides the best view for both spacecraft , because an asymmetric location would move the active region closer to the limb for one of the spacecraft , and thus would increase the degree of confusion , as we verified by triangulating a number of asymmetric cases .",
    "thus , we can express the quality factor of stereoscopic correspondence @xmath84 ( eq .",
    "7 ) by the spacecraft separation angle ( eq .  8) and obtain the relationship , @xmath94    defining a quality factor @xmath95 for stereoscopic triangulation by combining the stereoscopic correspondence quality @xmath84 ( eq .  9 ) with the accuracy @xmath89 of stereoscopic positions ( eq .  6 ) , which we may define by the normalized inverse error ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , we obtain @xmath97 } } } \\ .\\ ] ] we plot the functional dependence of this stereoscopic quality factor @xmath98 together with their underlying factors @xmath99 and @xmath100 in fig .  8 and",
    "obtain now an asymmetric function of time ( or spacecraft separation angle ) that favors smaller stereoscopic angles .",
    "the stereoscopic quality factor is most favorable ( within a factor of 2 ) in the range of @xmath90 , which corresponds to the mission phase between august 2007 and november 2009 .",
    "the same optimum range will repeat again at the backside of the sun 5 years later between august 2012 and november 2014 .    from our analysis of 5 active regions spread over the entire spacecraft separation angle range we find acceptable results regarding triangulation accuracy in the range of separation angles of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( based on acceptable misalignment angles of @xmath103 , which coincides with the predicted optimum range of @xmath2 , while stereoscopy definitely brakes down at @xmath104 , as predicted by theory ( fig .",

    "all but the first factor depend on the spacecraft separation angle @xmath105 , which is a specific function of time for the stereo mission ( with a complete cycle of 16 years ) . in order to assess the science return of the stereo mission or future missions with stereoscopic capabilities , it is instructive to quantify the statistical probability of acceptable stereoscopic results as a function of spacecraft separation angle or time .",
    "we already quantified the quality of stereoscopy @xmath98 as a function of the stereoscopic angle in eq .",
    "let us define the number probability @xmath108 of existing active regions at a given time @xmath109 with a squared sinusoidal modulation during the solar cycle , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the maximum number of active regions existing on the total solar surface during the maximum of the solar cycle , @xmath112 is the time of the solar minimum ( e.g. , @xmath113 ) , and @xmath114 yrs the current average solar cycle length .",
    "the second effect is the overlapping area on the solar surface that is simultaneously seen by both spacecraft stereo / a and b , which decreases linearly with the spacecraft separation angle from 50% at @xmath115 ( with @xmath116 at the start of spacecraft separation ) to 0% at @xmath117 ( with @xmath118 at maximum separation ) , and then increases linearly again for the next quarter phase of a mission cycle . if we fold the variation @xmath108 of the solar cycle ( eq .",
    "11 ) with the triangular stereoscopic overlap area variation @xmath106 together , we obtain a statistical probability for the number of stereoscopically triangulable active regions .",
    "however , the number of accurate stereoscopical triangulations scales with the quality factor @xmath98 ( eq .  10 ) , where the spacecraft separation angle @xmath105 is a piece - wise linear ( triangular ) function of time @xmath109 according to the spacecraft orbit .",
    "essentially we are assuming that the probability of successfull stereoscopic triangulations at a given time scales with the quality factor or feasibility of accurate stereoscopy at this time .",
    "so , we obtain a combined probability of stereoscopically triangulable active regions of , @xmath119 \\ .\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "9 we show this combined statistical probability of feasible stereoscopy in terms of the expected number of active regions for a full mission cycle of 16 years , from 2006 to 2022 .",
    "it shows that the best periods for solar stereoscopy are during 2012 - 2014 , 2016 - 2017 , and 2021 - 2023 .",
    "after the stereo mission reached for the first time a full @xmath7 view of the sun this year ( 2007 feb 6 ) , the two stereo a and b spacecraft covered also for the first time the complete range of stereoscopic viewing angles from @xmath58 to @xmath70 .",
    "we explored the feasibility of stereoscopic triangulation for coronal loops in the entire angular range by selecting 5 datasets with viewing angles at @xmath29 and @xmath120 . because previous efforts for solar stereoscopy covered only a range of small stereoscopic angles ( @xmath121 ) , we had to generalize the stereoscopic triangulation code for large angles up to @xmath122 .",
    "we find that stereoscopy of coronal loops is feasible with good accuracy for cases in the range @xmath123 , a range that is also theoretically predicted by taking into account the triangulation errors due to finite spatial resolution and confusion in the stereoscopic correspondence identification in image pairs , which is hampered by projection effects and foreshortening for viewing angles near the limb .",
    "accurate stereoscopy ( within a factor of 2 of the best possible accuracy ) is predicted for a spacecraft separation angle range of @xmath124 .",
    "based on this model we predict that the best periods for stereoscopic 3d reconstruction during a full 16-year strereo mission cycle occur during 2012 - 2014 , 2016 - 2017 , and 2021 - 2023 , taking the variation in the number of active regions during the solar cycle into account also .",
    "why is the accuracy of stereoscopic 3d reconstruction so important ?",
    "solar stereoscopy has the potential to quantify the coronal magnetic field independently of conventional 2d magnetogram and 3d vector magnetograph extrapolation methods , and thus serves as an important arbiter in testing theoretical models of magnetic potential fields , linear force - free field models ( lfff ) , and nonlinear force - free field models ( nlfff ) .",
    "a benchmark test of a dozen of nlfff codes has been compared with stereoscopic 3d reconstruction of coronal loops and a mismatch in the 3d misalignment angle of @xmath125 has been identified ( derosa et al .",
    "2009 ) , which is attributed partially to the non - force - freeness of the photospheric magnetic field , and partially to insufficient constraints of the boundary conditions of the extrapolation codes .",
    "empirical estimates of the error of stereoscopic triangulation based on the non - parallelity of loops in close proximity has yielded uncertainties of @xmath126 .",
    "thus the residual difference in the misalignment is attributed to either the non - potentiality of the magnetic field ( in the case of potential field models ) , or to the non - force - freeness of the photospheric field ( for nlfff models ) .",
    "we calculated also magnetic potential fields here for all stereoscopically triangulated active regions and found mean misalignment angles of @xmath127 , which improved to @xmath128 for a nonlinear force - free model , which testifies the reliability of stereoscopic reconstruction for the first time over a large angular range .",
    "the only case where stereoscopy clearly fails is found for an extremely large separation angle of ( @xmath129 ) , which is also reflected in the largest deviation of misalignment angles found ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) . based on these positive results of stereoscopic accuracy over an extended angular range from small to large spacecraft separation angles",
    "we anticipate that 3d reconstruction of coronal loops by stereoscopic triangulation will continue to play an important role in testing theoretical magnetic field models for the future phases of the stereo mission , especially since stereoscopy of a single image pair does not require a high cadence and telemetry rate at large distances behind the sun .",
