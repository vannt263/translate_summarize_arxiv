    "the microscopic description of the vortex lines dynamics at scales that are still much larger than the vortex core size @xmath12 cm , was proposed by schwarz@xcite in the framework of vortex filament method ( vfm ) . in his approach",
    ", the influence of the normal component the dynamics on the quantum vortex lines is accounted through the mutual friction force with the predefined time - independent normal fluid velocity .",
    "it was soon realized that the back - reaction of the vortex tangle on the dynamics of the normal component may be important and several self - consistent methods , coupling navier - stokes equation for the normal component with lagrangian description of the vortex lines dynamics , were proposed@xcite .",
    "these methods are computationally challenging , given the wide range of scales involved in the problem .",
    "such a self - consistent studies were limited to space - homogeneous flows with diluted vortex tangles .",
    "the vfm methods were extended to the wall - bounded flows@xcite and more recently included full biot - savart description of the tangle @xcite . also here , a time - independent mean normal velocity profile , or a snapshot of the turbulent velocity field were imposed to generate the quantum vortex tangle .",
    "depending on the way the quantum turbulence is generated in the channel or pipe , the normal and superfluid components flow in the same direction , or in opposite directions . in the latter case ( the thermal counterflow ) , a relative , counterflow velocity @xmath13 is established in the channel . at sufficiently large values of @xmath13 the quantum vortex tangle is created . as @xmath13 increases , the thermal counterflow passes several stages . at relatively low values of counterflow velocity ,",
    "the normal components remains laminar , while a fully - developed quantum vortex tangle is formed , indicating superfluid turbulence .",
    "this regime was labeled at t1 state @xcite . at higher values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the normal component also becomes turbulent , forming so - called t2 state .    in this paper",
    "we address the back - reaction of the quantum vortex tangle on the normal velocity profile , restricting our study to t1 state of the counterflow in the channel . here",
    "we describe the laminar normal velocity by its mean profile ( neglecting normal velocity fluctuations ) , but allow its evolution , driven by the mutual friction force that couples dynamics of the mean normal velocity with the evolution of the vortex tangle . to be consistent with the nature of the mean profile , the mutual friction force , generated by the vortex tangle ,",
    "is integrated over space and short intervals of time .",
    "such a multi - scale , multi - time approach allows us to follow the coupled dynamics of two components and account for the influence of the vortex tangle on the normal component .",
    "we have found that initially parabolic mean normal velocity profile evolves to a flatter shape , with effect stronger for higher temperature and counterflow velocities . as a consequence",
    ", the vld profile becomes more uniform in the channel core with the peaks pushed towards the wall .",
    "both the global and microscopic properties of the flow change compared to the uncoupled dynamics , although this effect is significant only at high temperatures .",

    "therefore , qualitatively , the mutual friction redefines the effective pressure gradient in the middle of the channel @xmath91 , while near the wall it remains @xmath92 .",
