    "when the temperature in the neutron star envelope is sufficiently low , the cno cycle becomes temperature dependent ; as a result , the ignition of h becomes thermally unstable at low accretion rates @xcite . as a first investigation of the unstable ignition of h when the atmosphere is stratified , we perform several calculations of the burst nucleosynthesis .",

    "we shall first describe the outcome of these one - zone calculations ( eq .",

    "it is immediately clear that there are two very different outcomes for the h ignition . at lower accretion rates , the rise in temperature following",
    "h ignition is sufficient to trigger a vigorous he flash with a decay timescale @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ bursts.f ] , _ middle - left panel _ ) . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "however , the flash is too weak to ignite he . as an interpretation of these results , recall that the ignition curve for the @xmath67 reaction has a turning point at @xmath68 , which terminates the unstable branch @xcite . at the higher accretion rates ( fig .",
    "[ bursts.f ] , right panel ) the ignition of h occurs at @xmath69 , and the local rise in temperature does not trigger unstable he ignition .",
    "in fact , the temperature rise is not even sufficient to initiate convection , as the radiative temperature gradient needed to carry @xmath70 is @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , at lower accretion rates ( fig .",
    "[ bursts.f ] , left panel ) , the ignition of h occurs at @xmath72 , and the rise in temperature will ignite the triple-@xmath73 reaction .",
    "if subsequent h flashes do not ignite the underlying he , then a large layer of nearly pure he will accumulate . because our system is not burning h steadily ,",
    "the temperature in the he layer is colder than if the burning were in steady - state . _ as a result , a large he layer should accumulate . _ to get the thermal structure of an accumulated pure he layer , we integrated equations ( [ heat.e ] ) , with @xmath74 , from the column where h ignition occurred , and set the temperature there to that found in the accumulating model . for @xmath75 and 0.011 , the he ignition column density varies from @xmath76 ( recurrence time @xmath77 ) for @xmath78 varies from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "our one - zone approximation gives a cooling time @xmath81 $ ] , which roughly agrees with the long burst duration .",
    "using a simplified numerical model of an accreting neutron star envelope that allows for differential isotopic velocities , we have undertaken a first study of the effects of sedimentation and diffusion on the unstable ignition of hydrogen and helium on the surfaces of accreting neutron stars , and have investigated the outcome of unstable hydrogen ignition using simple one - zone models .",
    "our principal conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the effect of sedimentation changes the conditions at h / he ignition even for @xmath82 .",
    "2 .   there is a range of accretion rates for which unstable h ignition does not trigger a he flash .",
    "this range depends on the flux from the deep crustal heating and the degree of settling of he and cno nuclei .",
    "we speculate that successive weak h flashes can lead to the accumulation of a large reservoir of he ; this may explain the long bursts observed from some sources .",
