    "the masses of the so called light quarks used in lattice qcd calculations are not light enough for chiral perturbation theory to be a reliable guide to extrapolating the results to the physical quark masses .",
    "for example , in our recent work on determining the parameters of the chiral qcd lagrangian  @xcite , we were unable to test fully the chiral perturbation theory predictions because the dynamical quarks were too heavy and there was a lower limit on the mass of the valence quarks caused by exceptional configurations .",
    "the alpha collaboration have developed  @xcite the twisted clover fermion action , specifically to study the light quark mass region of qcd .",
    "the alpha collaboration  @xcite have used the twisted clover action in numerical simulations within the schrdinger functional formalism .",
    "we report the first computation of hadron spectroscopy using the twisted clover fermion operator with periodic in space and anti - periodic in time boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath0    the operator @xmath1 is the fermion operator that is independent of the quark mass .",
    "the mass term @xmath2 has no additive renormalisation , hence it provides a lower limit to the eigenvalue spectrum of the fermion operator .",
    "the main disadvantages of the twisted clover action are that parity and flavour symmetry are explicitly broken . however , the flavour symmetry breaking looks very different to the mechanism in the staggered fermion formulation  @xcite , so the effects of the flavour symmetry breaking may be less of a problem .    the transformation @xmath3 transforms the action in eq .",
    "[ eq : twistaction ] , when d anti - commutes with @xmath4 as in the continuum , into the standard qcd action @xmath5 where @xmath6 the alpha collaboration  @xcite advocate the following procedure .",
    "the simulations are carried out using the twisted clover operator on the lattice .",
    "the results are then matched to the continuum twisted fermion operator .",
    "the rotations in eq .",
    "[ eq : magictrans ] are then used to rotate back to the standard qcd fermion action in the continuum .",
    "the rotations should reduce the effect of the flavour and parity symmetry breaking on the physical spectrum .",
    "the connection between qcd and twisted qcd could be more complicated , when there is spontaneous breakdown of parity and flavour symmetry , such as in the aoki phase  @xcite . another way to look at",
    "the connection between the twisted and the traditional clover action is to think that the rotations eq .  [ eq : magictrans ] are done on the lattice  @xcite . in this viewpoint",
    "the rotations ( eq .  [ eq : magictrans ] ) are similar to the effect of a preconditioner , except that the connection between the twisted and standard clover actions is not exact , because the transformation in eq .",
    "[ eq : magictrans ] also rotates the wilson term in the operator ,    the formalism for the @xmath7 improvement of the twisted fermion operator has been described in  @xcite .",
    "the parity and flavour symmetry violating parts of the twisted clover action make the construction of the interpolating operators nontrivial .",
    "alpha  @xcite use the twisting rotations in eq .",
    "[ eq : magictrans ] to construct the interpolating operators .",
    "consider a general meson interpolating operator @xmath8 for the wilson / clover action all three meson operators ( i = 1,2,3 ) are equivalent .",
    "the flavour symmetry breaking term in the twisted action breaks the equivalence  @xcite .    for i = 1,2 the generic meson operators are @xmath9 for @xmath10 = 1 ( scalar ) , @xmath4 ( pion ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( second rho operator ) .",
    "@xmath14 for @xmath10 = @xmath15 ( pion ) , @xmath16 ( `` exotic '' ) , @xmath17 ( rho ) @xmath18    the neutral meson operator is proportional to @xmath19 the neutral meson operator has the opposite connection between the gamma matrix and the mixing as for the charged meson operators .",
    "disconnected fermion loops are required to compute the correlators for the neutral meson operator , because the twisted fermion operator does not obey @xmath20  @xcite .    to compute the correlator for the nucleon with an interpolating operator , such as : @xmath21",
    "separate inversions are required for the up and down twisted clover propagators .",
    "these can be rotated back to the clover fermion matrix using eq .",
    "[ eq : magictrans ] , before the nucleon correlator is constructed .",
    "the simulations were performed at @xmath22 on @xmath23 lattice in the quenched approximation . the numerical value of the clover coefficient determined by the alpha collaboration  @xcite was used . the ukqcd collaboration  @xcite found , at the same parameters , evidence for exceptional configurations at @xmath24 , hence we aimed to use the twisted clover action to explore the quark mass region under that limit . for this exploratory study we only used 30 configurations .",
    "ukqcd found  @xcite @xmath25 , so we initially ran at ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 = 0.02 ) , ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 = 0.01 ) , and ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 = 0.005 ) .",
    "we were aiming for @xmath28 , but this @xmath29 value was not close enough to @xmath30 , and the @xmath31 values for the runs @xmath27 = 0.02 , 0.01 , and 0.005 were : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "for all these runs we used the standard stabilised biconjugate gradient algorithm . to increase @xmath31 to be close to @xmath35 we ran at ( @xmath36 , @xmath27 = 0.01 ) and ( @xmath36 , @xmath27 = 0.005 ) . for the inversions with @xmath36 ,",
    "the conjugate gradient algorithm had to be used .    with the low statistics we could only obtain satisfactory fits to the pion correlator .",
    "factorising fits  @xcite were performed to a 2 by 2 matrix , with a basis of fuzzed and local correlators  @xcite .",

    "[ eq : backtoqcd ]  @xcite , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mass from the pcac relation ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ eq : pionfig ] .",
    "the pion mass from the twisted clover simulation with the parameters @xmath41 is @xmath42 % lower than the pion mass obtained from the clover action result at the point where exceptionals become a problem ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the effect of the @xmath4 term on the eigenvalue spectrum of the clover fermion matrix .",
    "consider the eigenvalue equation for a single flavour of the twisted clover action .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fermion matrix of the clover action .",
    "the relation @xmath20 implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath45 are either real , or come in complex conjugate pairs ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the real eigenvalues of @xmath45 are also eigenvalues of @xmath4 , hence the eigenvectors of the clover fermion matrix with real eigenvalues are also eigenvectors of the twisted matrix with complex eigenvalues .",
    "the complex eigenvalues of @xmath45 are not eigenvalues of @xmath4 , so there is no simple connection between the eigenvalues of the twisted clover fermion operator and those of the clover fermion operator .",
    "perturbation theory shows that the first order perturbation  @xcite of the @xmath46 term on the spectrum is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the left eigenvector of the clover fermion operator @xmath45 .",
    "unfortunately the symmetries of the clover operator @xmath45 do not constrain the matrix element of @xmath49 .",
    "the complex eigenvalues of @xmath45 are changed at @xmath50 by the @xmath51 term .",
    "we are using the arpack package to numerically study the eigenvalues of the twisted clover action .",
    "in the quenched approximation , the twisted clover action has allowed us to simulate at lighter pion masses than could be reached by the clover action .",
