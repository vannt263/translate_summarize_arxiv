    "rhombic rare - earth orthoferrites rfeo@xmath0 with r being a rare - earth ion or an yttrium ion are magnetic insulators that provide a classic example of the second order orientation phase transitions .",
    "orthoferrites have two magnetic subsystems : one of the rare - earth ions , and another of the iron ions",
    ". magnetic properties of the subsystems and interaction between them depend on the external parameters , e.g. temperature , field , pressure , etc . , and",
    "a series of phase transition is observed upon the parameter change .    in the temperature interval where phase transitions discussed in this work take place",
    ", the iron subsystem is ordered into a slightly canted antiferromagnetic structure exhibiting a weak ferromagnetic moment @xmath2 .",
    "the rare - earth system is paramagnetic .",
    "for all orthoferrites the antiferromagnetic structure below the neel temperature @xmath3 ( @xmath4k ) corresponds to the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) irreducible representation with magnetic vector @xmath2 pointing along the @xmath8 axis of the crystal and antiferromagnetic vector @xmath9 pointing along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the coordinates are chosen so that @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in orthoferrites with non - magnetic rare - earth ions ( r = la , lu , or y ) the @xmath5 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) configuration persists to the lowest temperatures .",
    "for many other orthoferrites a reorientation transition with the sequence @xmath5 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) @xmath13 @xmath14 ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) @xmath13 @xmath17 ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) is observed . upon cooling",
    "vector @xmath2 starts to rotate away from the @xmath8 axis at temperature @xmath20 .",
    "its continuous rotation towards the @xmath10 axis happens in the ( @xmath21 ) plane between temperatures @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "below @xmath23 , the system stays in the @xmath17(@xmath18,@xmath19 ) phase with @xmath24 .",
    "although the spin reorientation region @xmath25 $ ] has been studied for many orthoferrites by different experimental techniques , not enough is known about the specifics of the rotation .",
    "relevant experimental results are often incomplete , lack accuracy , tend to contradict each other , and do not correspond to either conventional landau theory  @xcite or its suggested modifications .",
    "recently  @xcite the temperature dependence of both @xmath10 and @xmath8 axis projections of the magnetic moment was measured with high accuracy for the single crystal samples of erfeo@xmath0 .",
    "these measurements gave the temperature dependence of the absolute value of the magnetization @xmath26 and its rotation angle @xmath27 with respect to the @xmath8 axis in the @xmath28 $ ] temperature interval at zero external magnetic field .",
    "the results were in very good agreement with the proposed modified mean field model ,  @xcite that emphasized the anisotropy of the rare - earth ions paramagnetic susceptibility .",
    "it was conjectured that this model would be suitable for other magnetic materials with similar phase transitions .",
    "the present study is aimed at the detailed measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath27 behavior in single crystals of ybfeo@xmath0 , that exhibit the same @xmath1 transition , with the purpose of checking this conjecture on another material .",
    "it is shown that the modified field theory of refs",
    ".   works well for ybfeo@xmath0 , even though in this orthoferrite the reorientation happens at an order of magnitude lower temperatures ( @xmath29k ) , than in erfeo@xmath0 ( @xmath30k ) , while the neel temperature remains roughly the same @xmath31k .",
    "measurements were performed on two single crystals of ybfeo@xmath0 .",
    "cubic sample a , weighting 0.0485  g , was made of a single crystal grown by spontaneous crystallization in the melt - solution .",
    "ellipsoid sample b , weighting 0.0715  g , was made of a single crystal grown by the no - crucible zone melting technique with radiation heating .",
    "the results for both samples are very similar .",
    "the temperature was varied in the 2 k to 10 k interval , and both @xmath32 and @xmath33 projections of the magnetic moment were measured by a quantum design mpms-5s squid magnetometer .",
    "the @xmath34 dependence at zero external magnetic field was found through the analysis of magnetization curves analogous to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a],[fig:1b ] . to analyze the data we recall , that the @xmath35 phase diagrams in the vicinity of the @xmath1 transition for @xmath36 and @xmath37 field directions are well known . according to them , as the magnetic field",
    "is swept through @xmath38 inside the @xmath25 $ ] reorientation interval , a first order transition happens for both directions of the field and manifests itself as a jump of magnetization component parallel to the applied field .",
    "first order transitions also happen above @xmath20 for @xmath36 and below @xmath23 for @xmath37 orientations , while no transitions are predicted below @xmath23 for @xmath39 and above @xmath20 for @xmath40 . in a real experiment exact orientation of the field direction",
    "is obviously impossible . a three - dimensional diagram valid for the arbitrary field direction  @xcite shows that for a tilted field a first order transition happens at any temperature and a jump of at least one magnetic moment projection should be observed . in the case of single - domain switching that would produce a rectangular hysteresis loop .",
    "well - developed rectangular loops were indeed observed in experiments on erfeo@xmath0 outside of the reorientation interval .",
    "@xcite inside the @xmath25 $ ] interval ( @xmath41k and @xmath42k for erbium orthoferrite ) they transformed into the s - shaped magnetization curves .",
    "such modification was attributed to the multi - domain state formation , possibly connected to the abrupt change in domain wall mobility .",
    "@xcite    in contrast with the case of erfeo@xmath0 , magnetization curves in ybfeo@xmath0 are s - shaped at all temperatures studied here for both @xmath37 and @xmath36 field orientations .",
    "the width of the magnetization curves for the magnetic field directed along the @xmath10 axis is larger then for the field along the @xmath8 axis . in general , the total width of the loops is considerably larger than in the case of erfeo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite in accord with the phase diagrams discussed above , magnetization curves become straight lines passing through the origin above @xmath20 for the @xmath37 orientation and below @xmath23 for the @xmath36 orientation .",
    "their slope in these regions corresponds to the paramagnetic contribution of the ytterbium ions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1a],[fig:1b ] ) .",
    "importantly , magnetization curves obtained for different samples are very similar .",
    "we extract the @xmath10 and @xmath8 projections of the bulk magnetization at zero external field by extrapolating their observed linear dependence at higher fields , @xmath43  oe , by @xmath44 and extracting the vertical intercept @xmath45 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 obtained through this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note , that while being very small everywhere , the hysteresis of s - shaped loops visibly increases in the reorientation region of ybfeo@xmath48 .",
    "this fact is illustrated by the following measurement .",
    "first , a saturating magnetic field @xmath49oe was applied either along the @xmath50- or along the @xmath51-axis .",
    "then , the field was reduced to zero and the projection of the remnant magnetic moment @xmath52 on the same axis was measured .",
    "two series of measurements , one for @xmath53 and another for @xmath54 were made .",
    "the results for the @xmath55 case are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] . for s - shaped hysteresis loops",
    "the remnant magnetic moment grows with the width of the loop .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates how the small hysteresis observed in the high - temperature symmetric phase @xmath56 grows inside the reorientation region and than drops to zero for @xmath57 .",
    "similar results were obtained for @xmath58 .",
    "this property of hysteresis loops in ybfeo@xmath0 turns out to be useful for the determinations of the critical temperatures @xmath59 : they are clearly marked by the kinks of the curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] and give @xmath60k and @xmath61k .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ]    the shape of the magnetization curves and the presence or absence of hysteretic behavior depends on the quality of the samples , energy of the domain walls , etc .",
    "the observed difference between erbium and ytterbium orthoferrites may result from the order of magnitude difference in the temperature of the reorientation transition .",
    "this question requires a separate study beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the absolute value of magnetization @xmath62 and rotation angle @xmath63 were extracted from the experimental data according to the expressions @xmath64 and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "experimental results presented in fig .  [ fig:2 ] and fig .  [ fig:3 ] show that as the temperature is lowered from @xmath3 to @xmath20 , the magnetization of the crystal gradually grows .",
    "this reflects the build up of the iron moment near @xmath3 and subsequent development of the ytterbium moment along iron moment  @xcite at lower temperatures . in the narrow reorientation region",
    "@xmath25 $ ] the magnetization rapidly grows almost two - fold .",
    "below @xmath23 the magnetization continues to grow .",
    "this supports the result of ref .  , suggesting that the ytterbium moment remains parallel to the iron moment , and does not switch to the antiparallel direction as stated in ref .  .",
    "our experimental results can be explained by the modified mean field theory suggested in refs .  .",
    "as the conventional landau theory ,  @xcite the modified theory assumes that the magnetization of iron subsystem is saturated at @xmath65 .",
    "the free energy of the iron subsystem is taken in the form @xmath66 with minimal assumptions about the temperature dependence of phenomenological constants inside the reorientation region , namely constant @xmath67 , and @xmath68 linearly varying with temperature and going through zero inside the reorientation interval , the minimization of the conventional energy functional ( [ eq:1 ] ) gives  @xcite @xmath69 figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] show that experimental results neither support the constancy of @xmath26 , nor give a @xmath27 dependence consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] )    according to the modified mean field model , paramagnetic susceptibility of ytterbium subsystem should also be taken into account to adequately describe the magnetic behavior of the orthoferrite .",
    "it is assumed , that in the molecular field of iron the rare - earth ion acquires a magnetic moment @xmath70 , while the absolute value of the iron moment @xmath2 remains constant .",
    "@xcite experimentally measured magnetization is the sum of the iron and rare - earth contributions @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath72 of the rare - earth ions is assumed to be anisotropic .",
    "this assumption naturally explains the large change of @xmath62 inside a narrow temperature interval , since rotation of @xmath2 leads to the change of @xmath73 and thus changes @xmath62 as well.@xcite the anisotropy of the rare - earth susceptibility has been reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite the key point of ref .   was the proper account of such anisotropy in the calculation of the rotation angle and absolute value of the magnetization , with the result : @xmath74 since @xmath75 and @xmath76 are measurable magnetizations of the sample at temperatures @xmath23 and @xmath20 respectively , the value of @xmath77 is known and expressions ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) have no fitting parameters .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    according to our measurements , the cubic sample a , for which most of the measurements were done , had @xmath78 k and @xmath61 k. using the values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 at these temperatures we find @xmath79 .",
    "theoretical curves given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] by solid lines .",
    "a convincing correspondence between the theory and experiment is evident .",
    "note , that the analysis of experimental data in terms of the model introduced in refs .",
    "is only valid inside the reorientation region .",
    "however , it is important that inside the region of its validity such analysis is independent of the driving mechanism of the transition , be it the interactions in the iron subsystem , the r - fe interactions , the behavior of the rare - earth magnetic succeptibility , or any other process .",
    "the approach of refs .   only requires the effective anisotropy constant @xmath68 to be a linear function of temperature . since precisely that behavior of @xmath68 was measured in refs .  , and",
    "shows that such behavior follows from the microscopic model of ref .",
    ", the modified mean field theory @xcite can be applicable for a wide variety of orthoferrites .",
    "in this paper we report direct measurements of the magnetization aboslute value @xmath80 and rotation angle @xmath27 during the @xmath1 spin - reorientation transition in ybfeo@xmath0 single crystals .",
    "the results favor the importance of strongly anisotropic rare - earth contribution to the magnetization of the material .",
