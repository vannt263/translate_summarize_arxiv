    "the hubbard model @xcite is one of the most common models for the description of strongly correlated electron systems on lattices . because it contains the motion of the electrons as well as the interaction between two electrons at the same site it is capable to describe charge degrees of freedom as well as magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "due to the rich physical behavior of the hubbard model an analytic solution is not possible except in one dimension @xcite .",
    "one common route to simplify the model for large repulsion @xmath4 is to derive an effective model which does no longer contain charge fluctuations across the charge gap .",
    "processes which change the number of doubly occupied sites ( double occupancies , dos ) are eliminated . for large enough repulsion @xmath4 and at half - filling",
    "the electrons are fixed on their lattice sites . in this mott - insulating phase",
    "the model can be mapped onto a heisenberg model describing only the energetically low - lying spin degrees of freedom . in the immediate vicinity of half - filling the motion and the interaction of doped holes",
    "is described by the extension of the heisenberg model to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "the metallic behavior for small values of the repulsion is beyond the applicability of this mapping @xcite .    in the present work the mapping of the hubbard model to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model",
    "is extended to finite macroscopic doping concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the influence of the doping @xmath2 on the resulting parameters of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is studied for sufficiently large repulsion .",
    "our approach provides a systematic and controlled derivation of the effective coupling constants as function of the doping concentration .",
    "thereby , an important gap between the applicability of the derivation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model and its actual applications is closed .    first , we consider the half - filled case .",
    "the elimination of the charge fluctuations across the charge gap is performed by a self - similar continuous unitary transformation with various types of generators .",
    "besides the magnetic exchange couplings , the resulting @xmath0-@xmath1 model contains the motion and the interaction of holes and doubly occupied sites .",
    "since the mapping starts from a reference ensemble comprising the two spin states with equal weight and without any correlations between the spins on neighboring sites the spin state in the effective model remains unspecified .",
    "the mapping relies on the elimination of processes changing the number of holes and doubly occupied sites .",
    "note that an empty site represents a double occupancy of two holes . in the half - filled case the density of states exhibits two distinct bands for large @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_dos_half ] ) .",
    "the bands display equal weight @xmath5 and they are well separated for large @xmath4 @xcite . thus the states without holes or doubly occupied sites are energetically well separated from the ones with one or more holes or doubly occupied sites . if @xmath4 is decreased the bands approach each other .",
    "as soon as they touch the insulating phase is no longer the appropriate phase and metallic behavior occurs resulting in the breakdown of the mapping to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . @xcite . ]",
    "the density of states exhibits two distinct , equally weighted bands , the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) and the upper hubbard band ( uhb ) @xcite . ]    .",
    "the weight of the hole state is given by @xmath2 .",
    "the two half - filled states both carry the weight @xmath6 . note that the weight of the lower band is larger than the one of the upper hubbard band @xcite . ]",
    "the generic density of states obtained in the doped case is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_dos_dop ] .",
    "the effect of the doping on the density of states consists in shifting the fermi energy into the lower hubbard band for hole doping and redistributing the weight of the bands .",
    "electron doping is completely analogous in shifting the fermi energy into the upper hubbard band .",
    "since we focus here on particle - hole symmetric , bipartite lattices we will consider hole doping without loss of generality .    it is obvious from the comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig_dos_half ] with fig .",
    "[ fig_dos_dop ] that the energetic separation of the hubbard bands is more subtle in the doped case than in the half - filled case .",
    "the bands are shifted depending on @xmath2 _ and _ spectral weight is transferred as well .",
    "the shift of spectral weight is a smoking gun evidence for strongly correlated fermionic systems .",
    "simple counting arguments in the limit @xmath7 tell us the distribution of weight . adding an @xmath8 electron to a site succeeds with probability @xmath9 .",
    "the first term results from the fraction of empty sites ; the corresponding weight is found at low energy because no doubly occupied site has to be created .",
    "the second term results from the fraction of sites occupied by @xmath10 electrons ; the corresponding weight is found at about @xmath11 because a doubly occupied site is created .",
    "together with the sum rule the weights shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dos_dop ] result .",
    "we continue to use the number of doubly occupied sites ( dos ) as criterion to distinguish different sectors of the hilbert space . in order to have a quantitative measure for the energy separation of the sectors with differing number of dos the apparent charge gap @xmath12",
    "is introduced which measures the energy separation of subspaces .",
    "it does not measure the energy gap between two pure states which is the reason why we call this separation of energy scales `` apparent '' .",
    "while the apparent charge gap is not an energy gap in a rigorous sense it is experimentally significant : it quantifies the energy needed in an mott insulator to create a charge excitation irrespective of the spin state of the system .",
    "for instance , the system can be at a temperature which implies a disordered paramagnetic spin state while it preserves the insulating properties .",
    "in the half - filled case the apparent charge gap measures the minimal energy of a doubly occupied site moving in an arbitrary spin background .",
    "the apparent charge gap is reduced for increasing values of the band width @xmath3 .",
    "if the gap vanishes the system is no longer stable against charge fluctuations and the mapping fails @xcite .    obviously , the physical properties of strongly interacting fermionic systems depend considerably on the doping level @xcite .",
    "this fact leads automatically to the question how the validity of the mapping from the hubbard model to a generalized @xmath0-@xmath1 model is influenced by doping .",
    "thus the apparent charge gap has to be determined in dependence on the doping @xmath2 . keeping track of the apparent charge gap we determine the parameter range in which the mapping is still justified .",
    "this range of applicability may not be misinterpreted as phase diagram although it has some similarities @xcite .",
    "for instance , for large repulsion @xmath4 a doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model is still perfectly well defined while it displays metallic behavior .",
    "of course , it is expected that the applicability of a @xmath0-@xmath1 model decreases upon increasing doping @xcite .    in view of the above ,",
    "it is one of our central objectives to derive a diagram showing the range of applicability in dependence on the doping which has , to our knowledge , not been done before .",
    "our findings provide access to the limitations of the use of @xmath0-@xmath1 models in the context of planar cuprates to the extent that they can be described by a single - band hubbard model .",
    "the approach used is based on two conceptual ingredients .",
    "the first is a systematically controlled change of basis by means of continuous unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the second is the choice of a doped reference ensemble without spin or charge order . within the range of applicability",
    "the effective @xmath0-@xmath1 model is derived .",
    "the doping dependence of the effective coupling constants is studied .",
    "the results are given in dependence on the ratio @xmath13 and on the dopant concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the method implemented here uses a self - similar truncation scheme to reduce the amount of proliferating terms in the running hamiltonian .",
    "the truncation is performed according to the range of the processes , that means rather local processes are kept while ones of longer range are neglected .",
    "hence the local processes acquire a non - perturbative dependence on the bare , initial coupling constants of the system .    furthermore , recently introduced modified generators of the cut are implemented to cope with the vast amount of terms arising during the transformation @xcite .",
    "their results are very close to the previously used particle - conserving generator @xcite , but they significantly facilitate the calculation in terms of required memory and cpu time .",

    "we consider the fermionic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "it describes electrons with spin @xmath14 on a lattice site @xmath15 by their creation operator @xmath16 and their annihilation operator @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of two terms describing the single - fermion kinetics ( @xmath18 ) and their interaction ( @xmath19 )    @xmath20    the kinetic part consists of the hopping of an electron with spin @xmath14 from site @xmath15 to site @xmath21 and vice versa . for this process to take place @xmath15 and @xmath21 have to be nearest neighbors as indicated by the bracket under the sum .",

    "the second part of the hamiltonian determines the interaction of the electrons .",
    "this term constitutes a pure on - site interaction . in @xmath19 the operator @xmath26 represents the number operator for the electrons",
    "this indicates that putting two electrons on the same site costs the additional energy @xmath4 .",
    "in the hubbard model there are four possible states per site .",
    "the site may be singly occupied by one electron with spin up or spin down @xmath27,@xmath28 , doubly occupied by two electrons with opposite spin @xmath29 or completely empty @xmath30 .",
    "the last two configurations correspond to charge fluctuations and are referred to as double occupancies ( do ) in this context .",
    "the interplay of motion and interaction of electrons in the hubbard model provides a description of the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "another important field of application of the single - band hubbard model is the physics of high-@xmath31 cuprates @xcite .    for a large hubbard repulsion @xmath4 in the half - filled case",

    "[ fig_dos_half ] , the so - called lower ( lhb ) and the upper hubbard band ( uhb ) . for infinite @xmath4 each site of the lattice",
    "is occupied by one electron which is energetically fixed to its site .",

    "thereby , dos are created but the the physics remains rather local , that means , the charge correlation length stays small .",
    "based on the locality of the important processes one may map the hubbard model onto an effective @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the generalized @xmath0-@xmath1 model conserves the number of dos .",
    "it comprises a part which describes the magnetic degrees of freedom , which is a generalized heisenberg model , and a part which describes the motion and interaction of dos reflecting the charge degrees of freedom . in order to obtain a model conserving the number of dos , processes which create or annihilate dos have to be eliminated .",
    "one systematic way to achieve this objective is the application of continuous unitary transformations to the hamiltonian .    for smaller values of @xmath4",

    "charge fluctuations from this reference ensemble are the empty @xmath30 and the doubly occupied site @xmath29 .",
    "magnetic fluctuations are induced by the application by spin operators , see below .    considering doping we focus on hole doping only because the model at hand is particle - hole symmetric so that electron doping leads exactly to the same results .",

    "non - monotonic behavior of the rod suggests that the intended transformation does not succeed .",
    "there is no strict statement that a successful cut has to have a monotonic rod .",
    "it is well possible that the rod displays local maxima which indicate that some energy eigenstates are re - ordered , see for instance ref .  .",
    "if the cut is performed without approximation any unitary transformation is as good as any other .",
    "but since we have to truncate many terms the upturn of the rod indicates a potential loss of accuracy .",
    "if the total norm of the off - diagonal terms is large there is still a significant transformation to be done .",
    "in the course of this transformation the truncation of terms may introduce significant errors . in return",
    ", a quickly decreasing rod indicates that all coefficients to be eliminated decay fast and significant truncation errors are less likely .",
    "but we like to stress that the behavior of the rod is only an indicator for possible truncation errors which eventually may imply that the intended mapping breaks down .",
    "the faster convergence of the gs - generator is straightforward to understand because the gs - generator comprises only terms which create dos from the reference ensemble or which annihilate them , see eq .   and fig .",

    "the pc - generator aims in addition at eliminating processes starting from two and more dos so that there are even more processes which may decrease the total energy while the number of dos increases .",
    "hence we are not surprised to see that the pc - generator induces a flow of the rod which displays even more pronounced non - monotonic behavior .    from these observations the conclusion to always favor the gs - generator suggests itself .",

    "the gs - generator is quicker to implement and more robust in its convergence , but it achieves less because it decouples only the subspace without any dos . for deriving only an extended heisenberg model",

    "the mott - insulating phase becomes unstable at this very point @xcite .    turning the argument around we use the gap @xmath12 between the lower and the upper hubbard band as quantitative indicator of the energy separation of subspaces with different number of dos .",

    "but in finite dimensions , even without long - range magnetic order one has to expect that the charge gap will generically depend on the spin state .",

    "we eliminate the charge fluctuations by self - similar continuous unitary transformations .",
    "processes that change the number of double occupancies are rotated away .",
    "thereby , we obtain the effective coupling constants as function of the doping @xmath2 and of the ratio @xmath13 where @xmath3 is the bandwidth and @xmath4 the local interaction .",
    "note that the generalized @xmath0-@xmath1 model comprises the magnetic degrees of freedom as well as the kinetics and the interactions of double occupancies .",
    "we extended the concept of the apparent charge gap @xmath12 @xcite from half - filling to the doped system .",
    "this gap is not the true physical gap but it measures the energy separation of subspaces with differing number of double occupancies _ irrespective _ of the spin state .",
    "we argue that as long as @xmath12 is finite the mapping to a @xmath0-@xmath1 model is justified .",
    "a vanishing @xmath12 indicates the breakdown of this mapping . by estimating the parameter where @xmath225 holds we derived a diagram of applicability of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : appli ] . as expected the applicability",
    "is reduced upon doping @xmath2 .",
    "but it levels at intermediate values of doping so that the commonly assumed parameters for the description of high-@xmath158 cuprates lie within the range of applicability . to our knowledge ,",
    "no such result was derived before .",
    "furthermore we find that the coupling constants of the effective model show hardly any doping dependence .",
    "the only coupling which exhibits a significant dependence on @xmath2 is the hopping parameter @xmath215 describing hopping between diagonal neighbors .",
    "relative to its value at half - filling @xmath215 exhibits a strong doping dependence .",
    "but the absolute value of this hopping element remains small .",
    "thus within a wide range of doping the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with constant coupling constants is appropriate . besides the usually considered terms",
    ", the 4-spin ring exchange on each plaquette should be included .",
    "technically we used recently developed types of infinitesimal generators for the continuous unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "they only decouple certain subspaces of the hilbert space which simplifies and accelerates the calculations .",
    "so far , the pc - generator was used which leads to a particle number conserving effective model ; the particles are the double occupancies @xcite .",
    "we extended the gs - generator introduced previously for the ground state of matrices @xcite and of many - body systems @xcite to mixed reference ensembles .",
    "the gs - generator is particularly suited to obtain the purely magnetic heisenberg model since it efficiently decouples the subspace of the reference ensemble from the remainder of the hilbert space . if , however , the dynamics of the double occupancies matters as well , the gs,1p - generator turned out to be a good compromise between efficiency and sufficient decoupling .",
    "this generator decouples the reference ensemble and the states with one double occupancy from the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "we found that the couplings derived from a faster gs,1p - calculation agree very well with the results from a slower pc - calculation .",
    "we expect that these generator or modifications of them will continue to play an important role in the systematic derivation of effective models .",
    "the present analysis for the square lattice can certainly be extended to other types of lattices such as the triangular lattice which has already been analysed by perturbative cuts @xcite , the honeycomb lattice @xcite , or more sophisticated lattices such as the kagom lattice and so on . in this way",
    ", the effects of subleading magnetic exchange processes such as ring exchange can be analysed quantitatively .",
    "another route to extend the present calculation is to also transform the observables , for instance the standard fermionic creation operator . at half - filling",
    ", one will then be able to compute the spectral weight in the upper hubbard band , that means in the subspace with one double occupancy .",
    "but there should be also weight in the subspaces with three and more double occupancies .",
    "to our knowledge , no estimate whatsoever exists for the weight in such trans - hubbard bands .",
    "more generally , the systematic derivation of effective models in other contexts can be tackled by adapting the ideas of the present work .",
    "for instance , the reliable downfolding of interacting fermionic models with many bands to models with a minimum number of bands and hubbard - type of interactions is a long standing field of research @xcite which continues to attract much attention , see for instance refs .  .",
    "we think that continuous unitary transformations provide an promising approch to make systematic and controlled progress in this field ."
