    "gaussian entangled states of two subsystems are well studied in the quantum communication and information literature .",
    "these states are often encountered in quantum communication experiments .",
    "however non - gaussian entangled states are also important in the context of quantum communication .",
    "for example , such a communication system may be constructed in two steps @xcite : ( a ) encoding based on product states of gaussian states , ( b ) decoding based on measurement on this continuous set of gaussian states . during decoding",
    ", one must generate superpositions of input gaussian states , which are essentially non - gaussian states .",
    "thus quantum communication systems may require non - gaussian states .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to achieve a quantum speed - up using only harmonic oscillators and corresponding gaussian operations bartlett : the dynamics of such a system can be efficiently simulated classically .",
    "this , in turn , means that to gain a quantum advantage in this scenario , one needs to use non - gaussian operations .",
    "it has also been shown that the distillation of entanglement from two gaussian entangled states is impossible using only local gaussian operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "thus , both quantum speed - up and distillation of entanglement , which have a close relationship with quantum error correction , require non - gaussian operations .",
    "recently there have been a few proposals to detect entanglement in such non - gaussian states @xcite .    in this work we focus on the problem of preserving non - gaussian entanglement in noisy quantum communication channels .",
    "there have been several proposals based on quantum purification protocols and quantum repeaters to communicate entangled photonic qubits over long distances @xcite .",
    "alternatively , entanglement between distant nodes can be prepared by measurements along a chain of intermediate particles wulidarschneider:04,compagno:04 .",
    "the problem we address here is quite different : rather than setting up remote entanglement between distant nodes , we consider the problem of transmitting entangled field states for a long distance along an optical fiber . specifically , we propose a method that preserves the multiphoton entanglement of a class of non - gaussian states transmitted through an optical fiber .",
    "most optical fibers are known to have minimum loss windows at wavelengths of the order of few microns .",
    "the optical frequencies generally suffer attenuation inside such a fiber .",
    "this loss adds to other decoherence processes which degrade the fidelity of entanglement transmission .",
    "we propose a hybrid approach to control decoherence of optical - frequency non - gaussian states inside an optical fiber .",
    "specifically , we utilize decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) @xcite and quantum dynamical bang - bang ( bb ) decoupling @xcite protection to preserve non - gaussian entanglement . the dfs protection is used against differential dephasing of the two field modes used to construct non - gaussian entangled states .",
    "the bb process is applied in order to deal with the remaining relevant decoherence sources , in particular raman scattering .",
    "this is done by inserting phase shifters at regular intervals along the length of the optical fiber , similarly to the proposal in @xcite where this spatial bb procedure was used to protect single photon polarization states transmitted through optical fibers . in this manner",
    "we provide a novel application of the general hybrid dfs - bb strategy proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ int ] , we introduce a class of non - gaussian states and model their interaction with an optical fiber . in sec .",
    "[ hybrid ] , we describe in detail a hybrid approach to eliminating their decoherence during transmission through an optical fiber . in sec .",
    "[ inhom ] , we provide a numerical estimate of loss of entanglement through a realistic fiber using a boson - boson model of interaction between the field and the fiber .",
    "the simplest examples of non - gaussian states of the electromagnetic field are the single photon states .",
    "other examples are states generated by excitations of a gaussian state @xcite .",
    "another method to produce non - gaussian states uses state - reduction @xcite .",
    "a recent experimental proposal discusses how to generate non - gaussian states by subtracting a photon from each mode of a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xcite .",
    "we consider non - gaussian entangled states @xmath2 of two field modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are bosonic annihilation operators ) , produced by subtracting @xmath5 photons from one of the modes ( say , @xmath3 ) of a squeezed vacuum state @xmath6 , given by , @xmath7 is the complex squeezing parameter and @xmath8 is the normalization constant .",
    "this state is non - gaussian in the sense that its coordinate representation is a non - gaussian function of space - coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13th order hermite polynomial .",
    "note that for @xmath14 , the state becomes gaussian .",
    "the entanglement in this state can be verified by the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite .",
    "we find that the density matrix of the state @xmath15 the eigenvalues of the above matrix can be calculated as @xmath16 existence of negative eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath17 reflects that the state @xmath2 is entangled .",
    "the negativity @xmath18 @xcite of the state @xmath2 can be written as @xmath19 which is the absolute sum of all negative eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the non - zero value of @xmath18 reflects that the state is entangled .",
    "deviation of the value of @xmath18 from zero is a measure of the degree of entanglement .",
    "it is thus clear from fig .  1 that the two modes become more entangled with increasing values of @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the state @xmath22 is transmitted through an optical fiber of length @xmath23 and thereby interacts with the fiber modes , which leads to decoherence of the state .",
    "an optical fiber consists of many dielectric molecules , each of which contains many electronic energy levels .",
    "the interaction of the input field states with the fiber can be reasonably described by a molecule - field interaction hamiltonian .",
    "dominant decoherence mechanisms are phase damping and energy exchange between the field and the molecules .",
    "the exchange processes can be expressed via the following hamiltonian , under the rotating - wave approximation : @xmath24where @xmath25 describes the field operators and @xmath26 describes the molecular operators . here the molecules in the fiber act as the bath , leading to decoherence .",
    "the exact form of the field operators @xmath25 in the above hamiltonian depends upon the model of the interaction .",
    "for example , if the field modes are at near - resonance with the single - photon transition in the molecules , dipole coupling between them leads to @xmath27 .",
    "dipole coupling dominates higher order coupling ( e.g. , quadrupole coupling or magnetic dipole coupling ) , which would lead to multi - photon processes .",
    "thus , at near - resonance , single - photon absorption by the molecules leads to decoherence .",
    "clearly , far from single - photon resonance , higher order processes can dominate . in light of these considerations , we assume that the frequencies of the two field modes are so chosen that two - photon processes may occur in the system , while the cross - section of single - photon processes becomes negligible . specifically , we choose the frequencies of the field - modes to be much smaller than the energy gaps between the ground and first excited electronic states .",
    "there are two different kinds of two - photon processes that may occur in a molecule : annihilation ( creation ) of two photons described by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) , and photon - number conserving processes ( described by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) .",
    "if we assume the molecules are in their electronic ground states ( at low temperature , as discussed later ) , the process of absorption of two photons of two orthogonal modes is disallowed due to certain selection rules @xcite . moreover , as both modes propagate in the same direction through the fiber , doppler shift of the photon frequency causes the absorption processes of two photons in the same mode to be off - resonance @xcite .",
    "thus , we are led to a situation where most of the molecular levels are resonant with the second kind of two - photon transitions .",
    "this means that low - energy scattering of the photons , namely raman ( described by @xmath34 and @xmath38 ) and dephasing processes ( described by the number operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which is equivalent to rayleigh scattering ) , are most likely to occur inside the fiber . in this case , we can write the effective interaction hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation as @xmath41where @xmath26 is the annihilation operator that corresponds to relevant transitions of @xmath42th molecule in the fiber , @xmath43 s are the coupling strengths , @xmath44 is the dephasing operator for the @xmath42th molecule ( the exact form of this will be discussed later ) , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the respective dephasing rates of the two modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we discuss a hybrid approach to suppress these two - photon processes , i.e. , how the effect of the interaction hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) on the state @xmath22 can be eliminated .",
    "we start with the dephasing processes described by the number operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we rewrite the dephasing part of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , @xmath49 , in terms of two collective operators @xmath50as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "note that the two - mode number states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are eigenstates of the operator @xmath55 for all integers @xmath56 .",
    "thus these states form manifolds of decoherence - free subspaces with respect to differential dephasing for a given @xmath57 . in any manifold @xmath58 ( @xmath57 fixed ) ,",
    "any arbitrary superposition of all possible states is also a decoherence - free state @xcite . in this way , in the present case",
    "the state @xmath22 is a dfs under the action of collective dephasing @xmath59 .",
    "note that this protection does not require encoding , in contrast to the usual construction of decoherence - free subspaces @xcite .      as a second layer of protection of the state against other decoherence processes ( described by raman interactions ) ,",
    "we now follow the general hybrid dfs - bb method proposed in @xcite . in the standard",
    "bb decoupling methods @xcite , one uses very short pulses so as to cancel the effective interaction hamiltonian .",
    "thus one ends up with only that component of the total hamiltonian of system and bath which commutes with the bb pulses .",
    "if the pulses are appropriately chosen , entanglement generation between the system and bath states can thus be prevented , and decoherence of the system is prevented .",
    "however , one has to apply the pulses in intervals shorter than the timescale of decay of the bath correlation .",
    "a recent proposal @xcite uses a spatial , rather than temporal version of this idea to overcome decoherence of a single - photon polarization state in optical fibers . ref .",
    "@xcite shows how to replace the short time - dependent pulses with phase shifters at regular intervals .",
    "our approach here is similar except that we deal with non - gaussian entanglement rather than single - photon states , and introduce a hybrid dfs - bb approach . in this way _",
    "entanglement can be transmitted over a long distance in quantum communication systems_.    let us start with the total system - bath hamiltonian in the form @xmath60where @xmath61 are the frequencies of the two field modes , @xmath62 is the free hamiltonian of the molecular bath , and @xmath63 is given by eq .",
    "the frequencies @xmath61 are chosen so that they are off - resonant with single - photon transitions , but possibly resonant with raman transitions in the fiber molecules . here and",
    "below we omit the zero - point energies when writing oscillator hamiltonians .",
    "the initial state is @xmath64 , where @xmath22 is the input non - gaussian entangled state and @xmath65 is the state of the bath ( for simplicity we use a pure - state notation also for the bath ; below we consider the effect of the bath s state more carefully ) . at the time @xmath66  where @xmath23 is the length of the fiber , and",
    "@xmath67 is the average speed of light in the fiber  the total wave function is @xmath68 @xmath69 ( the f subscript stands for free evolution ) . here",

    "i.e. , we have neglected deviations from average fiber homogeneity , @xmath77)^{2}\\rangle $ ] ( we discuss such deviations in section [ inhom ] ) .",
    "the spatial dependence of @xmath78 can come from the bath self - hamiltonian @xmath62 , while that of @xmath63 can come from the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath79 [ eq .  ( [ ham ] ) ] .",
    "therefore:@xmath80moreover , in subsection [ colldep ] below we argue that @xmath62 is effectively a molecular oscillator hamiltonian , so that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is an average frequency in an @xmath83-phonon state .    to eliminate the raman processes dynamically , we propose use of phase shifters , defined by the following operator @xmath84which generates a relative phase of @xmath85 between the two modes",
    "( alternatively we can define @xmath86 as @xmath87 or as @xmath88 ) .",
    "when these phase shifters are incorporated inside the fiber at intervals @xmath1 , the raman interaction part in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) effectively vanishes .",
    "this occurs because of the following identities .",
    "first , it is simple to show , using the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula @xcite that @xmath89and similarly for @xmath90 and @xmath4 .",
    "therefore@xmath91_these identities imply that the raman interaction is effectively time - reversed every _",
    "@xmath92 _ _  due to the action of the phase shifters__. to show the utility of this result note first that @xmath93because the field term of @xmath78 and @xmath94 obviously commute with @xmath95 and because averaging commutes with the phase shifter operation .",
    "now , if we install thin phase - shifters inside the fiber at positions @xmath96 , from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , the evolution will be modified to @xmath99note that in writing this expression we have neglected the variation of @xmath100 inside the phase - shifter ; this will hold provided that the phase - shifter width is much smaller than the distance over which deviations @xmath101 from average fiber homogeneity become significant .",
    "now assume that the _ average _ hamiltonians over two successive segments are equal : @xmath102the better this approximation , the better our hybrid dfs - bb  method will perform ; we address deviations in section [ inhom ] .",
    "in this case , to first order in @xmath103 , and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flip ] ) and ( [ pulse ] ) , we have exact cancellation of @xmath104 between successive segments : @xmath105where the smallness of @xmath103 is the justification for adding the arguments of the two exponentials in obtaining the last line . using eq .",
    "( eq : approxh ) again , this yields the overall evolution operator @xmath106    thus , to first order in @xmath103 ( or the inter - phase shifter distance @xmath107 ) , we have eliminated the raman term @xmath108 , and are left with the dephasing term @xmath109 , as @xmath110 causes no decoherence .",
    "considering @xmath111 , we note that the @xmath112 component yields only an overall phase on the state @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , the dfs corresponding to @xmath112 remains invariant under the action of @xmath86 as @xmath86 obviously commutes with @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the overall evolution operator reduces to @xmath114(where averages can be considered as being evaluated at @xmath23 ) and our remaining task is to eliminate the collective dephasing term ( proportional to @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , it turns out that it is impossible to do this with bb while using only linear optical elements .",
    "fundamentally , the reason for this is that the group generated by @xmath116 ( phase shifters and beam splitters ) is non - compact , which means that it can at most apply a dilation but not a sign change , as required for time reversal in the bb protocol . however , as we argue next , the collective dephasing term nevertheless has no significant effect on the preservation of non - gaussian entanglement .      in the low temperature limit ,",
    "most of the molecules in each segment of length @xmath1 reside in their ground electronic states . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the molecular vibrational states obey maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "the state of the molecular bath can be well described by a density matrix @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the boltzmann probability of an @xmath83-phonon excitation with energy @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath121 is the partition function , and @xmath122 is the @xmath83-phonon excited state .",

    "however , we observe that there are two physical limits where this dependence of @xmath134 on @xmath83 disappears .",
    "namely , if @xmath135 then for @xmath136 we find that @xmath103 becomes @xmath83-independent . in the opposite limit of very weak collective dephasing",
    "we also find that @xmath103 is @xmath83-independent ( there is a physical upper limit on @xmath83 in the gibbs state @xmath137 ) .",

    "note also that in absence of any bb control , the initial state @xmath2 evolves through the interaction hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "this leads to different combinations of the photon numbers in the two modes due to energy exchange with the molecular bath .",
    "thus the initial entanglement is destroyed at a length scale @xmath152 , corresponding to the dissipation time - scale @xmath153 of the molecular bath .",
    "so far we have assumed that the average hamiltonians over two successive segments of length @xmath1 are equal [ eq .  ( [ eq : approxh ] ) ] .",
    "however , due to inhomogeneity inside the fiber , the average hamiltonian differs between segments . in this section",
    ", we show that this fluctuation of the average hamiltonian leads to dissipation of the field and thus sets an upper limit to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we follow and improve the method described in appendix a of @xcite .",

    "these fluctuations lead to losses inside the fiber .",
    "however , in an amorphous silica fiber , the loss due to rayleigh scattering ( i.e. , due to terms containing @xmath164 and @xmath90 ) is much greater than the loss due to other mechanisms ( e.g. , due to raman scattering , i.e. , due to terms containing @xmath165 and @xmath38 ) @xcite . with this in mind",

    "we next extract a distance scale for the phase shifter separations from these considerations .",
    "the result ( [ loss ] ) due to fluctuation given by ( [ fluc_hamilt ] ) leads to an estimate of the spatial separation @xmath1 between two successive phase - shifters . note that for @xmath217 ( i.e. , for diagonal terms of the density matrix ) this fluctuation does not lead to any dissipation ( or loss of entanglement ) , as is clear from ( [ decay_sol ] ) .",
    "but the larger is @xmath218 , the higher is this dissipation . in other words , the largest off - diagonal contribution to",
    "the negativity comes from the terms with latexmath:[$%    estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "if we allow an error probability @xmath220 over the length of the fiber , then a sufficient condition for the present result to be useful is @xmath221rewriting the above using ( [ loss ] ) , we have @xmath222^{-1}\\right ) ^{1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\overset{x\\rightarrow \\infty } { \\longrightarrow } \\frac{v}{2\\omega _ { c}}\\ln [ 1-\\delta ( \\tau _ { l})]^{-1/2 } ,   \\label{limit}\\end{aligned}\\]]where we have used @xmath223 .",
    "the limiting value is attainable by fixing @xmath1 and letting the number of phase shifters @xmath171 become very large ( long fiber ) , with @xmath204 given and fixed .",
    "_ this sets an upper bound on the applicable value of _",
    "_ , which is essentially the ratio of the speed of light in the fiber to the bath high - frequency cutoff .",
    "_ _    in the following , we present a numerical estimate in a realistic situation , e.g. , for an optical fiber with an amorphous silica core .",
    "the inhomogeneity in silica leads to fluctuation as described above and thus decoheres the input fields .",
    "the debye temperature @xmath224 of crystalline silica is 342 k , where @xmath225 is the maximum phonon frequency ( frequency `` cut - off '' ) allowed inside the crystal .",
    "thus , the lifetime @xmath226 of phonons becomes of the order of @xmath216 . on the other hand , in amorphous solids the debye temperature and the lifetime of phonons",
    "are not well defined .",
    "however , at low temperatures @xmath227 , there exist certain empirical relations between them @xcite .",
    "for example , at @xmath228 k , which corresponds to a phonon frequency of @xmath229 hz , the life - time of phonons is of the order of @xmath230 s. we consider this frequency of phonons as maximum frequency @xmath231 allowed inside the fiber at @xmath228k .",
    "it has been shown that long distance distribution of entangled states of two qubits over a noisy quantum channel can be achieved using entanglement purification protocols @xcite .",
    "these protocols can be improved in terms of the requirement of physical resources as well as the error threshold , if one uses quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for an error probability @xmath232 ( which is much larger than the error threshold for fault - tolerant computation using single qubits ) inside the communication channel , quantum purification protocols work well , when combined with quantum repeaters .",
    "although , as explained in the introduction , the setup of our problem is quite different from that of quantum repeaters , for the sake of concreteness we use the threshold figure from that scenario and conservatively consider the case when the maximum error probability @xmath233 allowed through the fiber is @xmath234 .",
    "we consider a multimode fiber of length @xmath235 km .",
    "the time of propagation of the fields through the fiber is @xmath236 s , where @xmath237 , @xmath238 being the effective group index of the field through the fiber . using the parameters discussed above , we find from eq .  (",
    "limit ) @xmath239 mm .",
    "this means that the field sees the phase shifters at a time interval @xmath103 of @xmath240sec which , as required for the bb protocol , is _ much smaller _ than the time - scale for bath dissipation , @xmath241sec .",
    "we show in fig . 2 how the negativity ( [ neg_diss ] ) varies inside the fiber for the parameters discussed here .",
    "we find that the negativity becomes constant after a certain length scale inside the fiber , as discussed before .",
    "this is because , in the presence of bang - bang control , the effective contribution of bath fluctuations to the negativity vanishes at a time - scale when the bath correlation vanishes .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed in detail , how one can preserve entanglement in a class of continuous variable non - gaussian states against decoherence caused by coupling to a bosonic bath .",
    "specifically , we have considered transmission of an entangled state of two bosonic modes through an optical fiber and developed a hybrid approach combing decoherence - free subspaces and bang - bang control to sustain the entanglement .",
    "we described the non - markovian interaction with the bosonic bath consisting of molecules in the fiber and provided a detailed estimate of the relevant parameters to implement our approach in a realistic fiber .",
    "it turns out that to achieve a loss figure of @xmath242 in a 1 km fiber , phase shifters should be placed about 1 mm apart .",
    "this appears to be a technologically feasible requirement .",
    "hence we expect that the method proposed here will become a useful tool in the effort to transmit non - gaussian entangled states over optical fibers .                c. h. bennett , g. brassard , s. popescu , b. schumacher , j. a. smolin , and w. k. wootters , phys .",
