    "quantized vortices are one of the remarkable consequences of bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity in quantum fluids and are found in superfluids @xmath0he and @xmath1he and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of atomic gas . in the context of hydrodynamics ,",
    "quantized vortices often appear and play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena , such as the rotating of superfluid he @xcite , thermal counterflow in superfluid @xmath0he @xcite , and quantum turbulence @xcite .    among the many types of physics of quantized vortices , multiquantum vortices , whose winding number is larger than unity , are an interesting and important subject .",
    "multiquantum vortices have never been realized in superfluid @xmath0he except in some transient states @xcite .",
    "this is chiefly because an @xmath2-charged vortex , whose winding number is @xmath2 , is unstable and easily splits into @xmath2 single - quantum vortices , whose winding number is unity .",
    "atomic becs form another subject in the study of multiquantum vortices . in experiments ,",
    "optical technology enables us to make a multiquantum vortex and visualize the vortex directly @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because of the weak interaction between the atoms , it is relatively easy to perform a theoretical analysis by using the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model and the bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) model @xcite .",
    "thus , the splitting of multiquantum vortices has been experimentally observed @xcite and theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "an @xmath2-charged vortex essentially has unstable modes with @xmath3-fold symmetry and splits into @xmath2 single - quantum vortices .",
    "some studies also discuss multiquantum vortices in two - component becs @xcite .",
    "such vortex splitting instabilities are understood as a dynamic instability in the bdg model @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic instability has been actively studied , independent of these topics , in two - component becs , for example , the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite and the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite . as another type of hydrodynamic instability",
    ", we previously studied instability in uniform countersuperflow , miscible two - component becs with relative superfluid velocity between the two components @xcite .",
    "it is well known that uniform , miscible two - component becs are stable when the intraspecies interaction coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 and interspecies interaction coefficient @xmath6 satisfy the condition @xmath7 @xcite . however ,",
    "when the relative superfluid velocity between the two components exceeds a critical value , the system becomes dynamically unstable , causing a characteristic density pattern and vortex nucleation @xcite .",
    "the nucleated vortices are stretched so as to reduce the relative superflows between the two components .",
    "then , reconnection frequently occurs between the vortices , leading to binary quantum turbulence .",
    "csi has been recently observed in experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss counter - rotating ( cr ) vortices in miscible two - component becs trapped by a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "we consider that the first and second components simultaneously have an @xmath2-charged vortex and a @xmath8-charged one at the center of the becs , respectively .",
    "the winding numbers of the two vortices have the same magnitude but opposite sign .",
    "therefore , the two becs relatively rotate . for the following discussion ,",
    "we denote an @xmath2-charged vortex in the first and second components of the two - component bec as @xmath9-vortex and @xmath10-vortex , respectively .",
    "thus , a cr vortex that is overlapped by an @xmath2-charged vortex and a @xmath8-charged vortex is written as an @xmath11-vortex .",
    "the becs with a cr vortex are expected to be closely related to countersuperflow because the becs with a cr vortex and countersuperflow have similarity , such as relative motion .",
    "counter - rotating binary becs have been theoretically studied in a toroidal trap @xcite .",
    "our work focuses on natures of counter - rotating systems as a vortex in a harmonic oscillator potential .",

    "ii , we formulate a system of two - component becs with a cr vortex in the gp model at zero temperature .",
    "section iii is devoted to a linear stability analysis of cr vortices in the bdg model .",
    "we show that the instability of cr vortices is characterized by countersuperflow instability ( csi ) by numerically solving the bdg equations . in sec .",
    "iv , we reveal the nonlinear development of the instability of cr vortices by numerically solving the time - dependent gp equations .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "we consider miscible two - component becs described by the condensate wave functions @xmath12 in the mean - field approximation at zero temperature , where the index @xmath13 refers to each component ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the wave functions are governed by the coupled gp equations @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the @xmath13th component and the coefficient @xmath17 represents the atomic interaction with @xmath18 and the @xmath19-wave scattering length @xmath20 between the @xmath13th and @xmath21th components .",
    "our analysis supposes the conditions @xmath7 and @xmath22 , indicating that the static , miscible two - component becs are stable @xcite . for simplicity , we set the mass and the @xmath19-wave scattering length of the two components to the same value , namely , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25",
    ". the particle numbers of the two components are also the same : @xmath26 .",
    "the external trapping potential is a harmonic oscillator potential , given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the becs may be treated as a two - dimensional system when we use the  pancake \" trap geometry with @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we separate the degrees of freedom of the wave functions as @xmath30 . when the potential energy in the @xmath31 direction is sufficiently larger than the interaction energy , @xmath32 is approximated by the one - particle ground - state wave function in a harmonic oscillator potential : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a normalization constant and @xmath35 .",
    "then the gp equations are reduced to the dimensionless form @xmath36 with @xmath37 , where the length , time , and wave functions are scaled as @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and the two - dimensional particle number @xmath40 relates to @xmath34 through @xmath41 .",

    "the densities of the two becs must vanish at @xmath54 and @xmath55 because of the vortices and the trapping potential .",
    "note that @xmath56 and the densities have the same function , @xmath57 , because the two becs have the same parameters and the same winding number magnitude .    in this paper ,",
    "the nondimensional interaction parameters are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which causes repulsive interspecies interaction .",
    "for example , the parameters are realized in a system with @xmath60 atoms of @xmath61rb for each component .",
    "the @xmath19-wave scattering lengths are @xmath62 nm and @xmath63 , and also the trapping frequencies are @xmath64 hz and @xmath65 hz .",

    "we investigate the cases of small and large winding numbers of cr vortices .",
    "here , we study the linear stability of the cr vortices in the bdg model . after the formulation of the bdg equations , we first discuss the dynamic instability of @xmath11-vortices for small @xmath2 .",

    ", we do not take into account the thermodynamic instability by neglecting energy dissipation , which causes spontaneous amplification of the collective modes with negative energy . because a solution @xmath79 has its conjugate solution @xmath80 , we present here only the results for @xmath81 without loss of generality .    figure [ fig : bdg2](a ) shows the imaginary part of the frequencies of unstable modes with @xmath78 for the cases of small @xmath2 : @xmath82- , @xmath83- , and @xmath84-vortices .",

    "first , we explain the case of @xmath85 .",
    "this problem is connected to the interaction between vortices in different components in miscible two - component becs .",
    "the interaction between vortices in different components is repulsive ( attractive ) for repulsive ( attractive ) interspecies interaction when the distance between the vortices is large compared to the size of the vortex core @xcite . here , whether the intervortex interaction becomes repulsive or attractive is independent of the sign of the winding number of each vortex since the interaction results from the density nonuniformity through the term @xmath86 in the energy functional",
    "however , our results show that the short - range interaction depends on the signs of the vortex winding numbers .",
    "@xmath82-vortices have an unstable mode with @xmath87 [ fig .",

    "@xmath82-vortices have an unstable mode with @xmath87 , too .",
    "we found also that , for @xmath89- or @xmath90-vortices , there were unstable modes for @xmath91 but not for @xmath88 .",
    "these results mean that the sign of the short - range interaction depends on the signs of the winding numbers of vortices for @xmath88 ; thus , the interaction between a @xmath92-vortex and a @xmath93-vortex is attractive but that between a @xmath92-vortex and a @xmath94-vortex is repulsive for attractive interspecies interaction .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of the unstable mode of a @xmath82-vortex is localized around the vortex cores and its amplification makes the vortex split into a @xmath95-vortex and a @xmath96-vortex .",

    "the mode with @xmath101 has the largest imaginary part and is thus the most unstable .",
    "because the modes with @xmath70 cause the density profiles with @xmath70-fold symmetry , it is expected that a density pattern with three - fold symmetry appears after onset of the instability .",
    "this situation differs from the density patterns that appear in the splitting process of an @xmath2-charged vortex in single - component becs , where an @xmath2-charged vortex splits into @xmath2 single - quantum vortices .",
    "then the @xmath2-charged vortex has unstable modes with @xmath102 that make a density pattern with @xmath70-fold symmetry .",
    "however , the number @xmath70 of the most unstable mode is larger than @xmath2 in the case of the cr vortices .",

    "the amplitude of the most unstable mode is localized around the vortex core and decreases outside of the core as in the case of small @xmath2 .",
    "however , the peak of the amplitude being almost outside of the vortex core differs from the case of small @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the localized modes , in this case , there appear unstable modes with large @xmath111 whose amplitude is distributed broadly outside of the core .",
    "typically , amplitudes of such modes oscillate spatially over a wide range .",
    "we discuss here the relation between the instability of cr vortices and csi . in refs .",
    "@xcite , csi has been discussed in the bulk where condensate densities are uniform .",
    "characteristic aspects of csi are expected to appear in our cr vortex systems because of the relative rotation between the two components .",
    "to explain the nontrivial problem of the angular number @xmath70 of some unstable modes being larger than the winding number @xmath2 of the @xmath11-vortex , we further proceed with the local density approximation .",
    "let us introduce the local wave number vector @xmath112 in polar coordinates , where @xmath113 is the pseudo - wave number in the radial direction .",
    "when the relative velocity @xmath114 is much larger than the critical velocity of csi in uniform systems , the wave numbers @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which are , respectively , parallel and normal to the relative velocity , are characterized by the relation @xcite @xmath117    as a first step of the analysis , we evaluate approximately the instability of cr vortices with the local density of the becs . according to the form of the critical relative velocity of csi in uniform systems",
    ", we define the critical relative velocity @xmath118 in the local density approximation as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the nondimensional intraspecies interaction coefficient , @xmath121 is the density profile of the stationary state , and @xmath122 . equation ( [ eq : critical ] ) and the local relative velocity @xmath123 are plotted for the @xmath83-vortex and the @xmath108-vortex in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity ] . we have shown that an unstable mode has a certain amount of its amplitude even far from the vortex core for the @xmath108-vortex .",
    "this must be interpreted in relation to csi by the fact that the local relative velocity @xmath114 is larger than the critical velocity @xmath118 in the whole region for the @xmath108-vortex [ fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity](b ) ] ; csi can occur locally in the bulk far from the @xmath108-vortex because of the large relative velocity .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath83-vortex [ fig . [",
    "fig : velocity](a ) ] , we have @xmath124 only near the vortex core and the surface of the becs , where the local density approximation is inapplicable in the presence of a large gradient of the density .",
    "the fact that unstable modes are strongly localized in the vortex core in figs .",
    "[ fig : bdg2](b ) and [ fig : bdg10](b ) is consistent with the large difference between @xmath114 and @xmath118 around the center @xmath125 , although we have found that the unstable modes do not appear near the surface .",
    "this argument can be applicable to our system qualitatively , because @xmath126 is much larger than the criterion @xmath127 in a broad area around the density peak for the @xmath108-vortex , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity](b ) . by replacing @xmath115 and @xmath116 by @xmath128 and @xmath113 ,",
    "one obtains the characteristic numbers @xmath129 the former number comes from the maximum value of @xmath130 for unstable modes and the latter is the maximum wave number normal to the relative velocity .",
    "in fact , the former relation , @xmath131 is almost consistent with the maximum number @xmath132 of unstable modes for @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdg10](a ) .",

    "<S> the characteristic behaviors are completely different from those of multiquantum vortices in single - component bose - einstein condensates ; the number of vortices generated by the instability can become larger than the initial winding number of the counter - rotating vortex . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the instability by numerically solving the gross - pitaevskii equations . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dynamics drastically changes when the winding number of counter - rotating vortices becomes larger , which lead to nucleation of vortex pairs outside of the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> the instability eventually develops into turbulence after the relaxation of the relative rotation between the two components . </S>"
