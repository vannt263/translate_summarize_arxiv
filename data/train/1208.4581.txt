    "a number of optical emission lines were measured , and their relative intensities indicated photoionization by a non - stellar continuum attributed to the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . the radio emission and the optical line emitting gas",
    "were found to be strongly linked suggesting interaction between the radio source and its environment .",
    "in addition , shells and dust lanes observed in the optical band ( van breugel et al .",
    "1986 ) provide evidence of a past merger with a gas - rich disk galaxy which possibly triggered the rejuvenated agn activity .",

    "4c+29.30 was cataloged as an infrared point - source by the iras , wise and 2mass surveys ( nasa / ipac infrared science archive ) .",
    "the first detection of the source in the x - ray band occurred during a snap - shot 8ksec _ chandra _ observation ( gambill et al .",
    "the short exposure time and few detected counts prevented detailed spectral analysis .",

    "this observation was followed by our deep 300ksec _",
    "exposure ( siemiginowska et al . 2012 , hereafter paper i ) which clearly revealed diverse x - ray emitting structures , many of which correspond to those in radio or optical bands , and others are intrinsic to the x - ray band .",
    "the soft 0.52kev x - ray image showed northern and southern lobes , hotspots , southern jet , and thermal diffuse emission in the center .",
    "emission in the hard x - ray band ( above 2kev ) was instead dominated by the active nucleus of 4c+29.30 . in paper",
    "i , our discussion focused on the spectral properties of the soft x - ray components , the structure of the outflow , and interactions of the x - ray jet with the interstellar medium .",
    "we emphasized similarities between 4c+29.30 and famous radio galaxies showing jet - ambient medium interactions , i.e. m87 ( e.g. , million et al . 2010 ) , ngc 1275 ( e.g. , fabian et al .",

    "we compare the best fitting _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ models in order to study the origins of possible spectral variability . in section 4 we present the discussion of our results indicating that 4c+29.30 is a strongly absorbed intrinsically x - ray variable agn with seyfert 2 type of activity and a peculiar obscuring geometry , probably due to a geometrically thick torus similar to that reported for several _ swift_/bat selected agn ( e.g. , ueda et al .",

    "swift_/bat data were averaged over 58 months of observations , which potentially might introduce a discrepancy between the _ chandra _ ( or _ xmm - newton _ ) and _ swift_/bat data due to the x - ray flux variability .",
    "_ swift_/bat composite spectra contain fractional counts with gaussian statistic and are background subtracted , which prevents the cstat fitting .",

    "a region of the diffuse emission surrounding the nucleus can be clearly identified in the soft 0.52kev _ chandra _ image ( ` center ' in figure  2 in paper i ) . in paper i , we showed that a thermal bremsstrahlung model provided a better fit to the spectra extracted from this region than a power - law model .",
    "thus , all our models include a thermal bremsstrahlung component with the temperature and normalization allowed to vary .",
    "we modeled the _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ background spectra by fitting appropriate background regions ( figure  [ fig : regs ] ) with a model consisting of a galactic absorption , thermal bremsstrahlung and power - law .",
    "the background model parameters are listed in table  [ tab.mpar ] .",
    "the parameters differ because the _ xmm - newton _ background was collected from a region at the distance @xmath42 from the nucleus .",
    "we considered several models for the nuclear x - ray emission of 4c+29.30 observed with _",
    "chandra_.    _ model 1 .",
    "_ first , we tried a simple parametrization using a cut - off power - law function ( zhighect*zpowerlw in xspec terminology ; in the following we will refer to this component as cpl or ` a power - law ' ) .",
    "the zhighect model is defined as @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we assumed @xmath44 .",
    "the e - folding energy , @xmath45 could not be constrained by our data and we fixed it at 300kev .",
    "we added an intrinsic absorber with a variable column density ( zphabs ) , motivated by the presence of a dust line crossing the nuclear region , as revealed by the hst image ( figure  [ fig : opt ] ) .",
    "we were not able to obtain a good fit with this model .",
    "the plot of the model - to - data ratio revealed residuals in the 57kev band suggesting the presence of an iron k@xmath7 emission line ( figure  [ fig : ratcb]a ) .",
    "these residuals forced the photon index of the intrinsically absorbed ( @xmath46@xmath5 ) continuum to converge to an unusually low value , @xmath47 .",
    "_ model 2 .",
    "_ in model 2 we added a gaussian line ( zgauss ) which reduced the 57kev residuals significantly ( figure  [ fig : ratcb]b ) .",
    "the resulting line was narrow , @xmath48kev , and centered at the rest frame energy of @xmath49kev .",
    "these parameters suggest that the line originates in a neutral material far from the black hole , e.g. , at the outskirts of an accretion disk , or a dusty torus .",
    "the earlier short 8ksec _ chandra _ observation contained too few counts to detect the line or put an upper limit on its ew ( gambill et al .",
    "thus , this is the first detection of the iron k@xmath7 line in 4c+29.30 .",
    "the observed equivalent width of the line ( i.e. relative to the intrinsically absorbed continuum ) was ew@xmath50ev , while the intrinsic one ( i.e. relative to the unabsorbed continuum ) was ew@xmath51ev .",
    "the photon index in model 2 was still unusually low , @xmath52 , and the intrinsic absorption remained strong with @xmath53@xmath5 .",
    "the temperature of the diffuse emission , @xmath54kev , was in agreement with that measured in model 1 ( @xmath55kev ) , but considerably higher than the temperature of the background thermal bremsstrahlung component , @xmath56)kev .",
    "_ model 3 .",
    "_ the detection of the iron k@xmath7 line suggested that the total spectrum may contain a certain contribution of the associated reflected emission .",
    "hence , we considered the reflection model with a slab geometry , pexriv of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) , i.e. a reflection from an accretion disk .",
    "we first assumed that the reflected component is not intrinsically absorbed , contrary to the case of the incident cpl .",
    "this corresponds to a scenario in which the cpl continuum is observed through an obscuring material , e.g. , a dusty torus , while the reflected emission arrives to the observer unobscured . with default settings the pexriv model computes both the incident cpl and the reflected component .",
    "however , in order to apply the intrinsic absorber only to the incident cpl , we leave the cpl component in the model , and choose a setting in which the pexriv model returns only the reflected component .",
    "consequently , the reflection amplitude , @xmath57 , was fitted over a negative range , which physically corresponds to a reflection component with amplitude @xmath58 .",
    "we linked the photon index and the normalization of the pexriv model to those of cpl .",
    "the pexriv reflection does not account for the iron line emission and so we kept the zgauss component explicitly in the model .",
    "the viewing angle , @xmath59 , is not known for our source . however , an upper limit can be calculated based on the jet - to - counterjet flux ratio , @xmath60 , at 5 ghz ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",

    "we fixed @xmath59 at 45@xmath64 , assuming that the jet in 4c+29.30 is well aligned with the axis of the accretion disk .",
    "we fixed the abundances of elements at the solar value .",
    "the resulting data - to - model residuals are presented in figure  [ fig : ratcb]c .",
    "the ionization parameter in the pexriv model converged to zero .",
    "the iron line remained narrow , and centered at the rest frame energy of @xmath65kev .",
    "its observed ew@xmath66ev ( intrinsic ew@xmath67ev ) was lower than in model 2 .",
    "thus , the properties of the iron line and the reflected emission support the hypothesis that both components originate in a neutral matter located far away from the black hole . the power - law component with the photon index of @xmath68 was absorbed with an intrinsic column density @xmath53@xmath5 .",
    "the reflection amplitude yielded an intermediate value of @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature of the soft diffuse emission , @xmath70kev , was significantly lower than that in models 1 and 2 due to the contribution of the reflected component to the soft x - ray band , and slightly higher than ( but consistent with ) the temperature of the background thermal component .",
    "as a final model check we replaced the thermal bremsstrahlung component with an apec model .",
    "we were able to establish only an upper limit on the value of metal abundances , @xmath71 .",
    "it is generally known that low abundances might be an artifact resulting from fitting the mixed temperature plasma where these mixed temperature components can not be spectrally or spatially resolved ( see e.g. kim 2012 in context of abundances in hot ism of elliptical galaxies ) .",
    "this problem with regard to the data of 4c+29.30 was considered in more details in siemiginowska et al .",
    "similarly to their approach we decided to keep the thermal bremsstrahlung component in the model as a good approximation .",
    "_ model 4 .",
    "_ next , we allowed for the second intrinsic absorber altering the reflected component with a column density @xmath72 , in addition to the one modifying the intrinsic cpl emission .",
    "this model , however , converged to model 3 with @xmath73@xmath5 , consistent with zero .",
    "_ model 5 .",
    "_ motivated by the studies of other seyfert 2 type galaxies ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; grandi et al . 2007 ) we tested if a partial covering model ( representative for , e.g. , a patchy torus ) could provide an alternative description of our data .",
    "we assumed that only a fraction , @xmath74 ( allowed to vary between 0 and 1 ) , of the power - law emission is passing through an obscuring matter , while the remaining fraction ( 1-@xmath74 ) arrives to the observer unabsorbed .",
    "this model also converged to model 3 with @xmath75 .",
    "_ model 6 .",
    "_ next , we checked if a certain fraction , @xmath76 , of the intrinsic cpl may contribute to the soft emission below 1kev due to scattering .",
    "we found that the scattered component was not formally required by the data with an upper limit on the scattering fraction @xmath77 , thus model 6 converged to model 3 .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that model 3 accounts properly for the broad band x - ray continuum measured by _",
    "chandra_. in this model , the nuclear radiation described by a cut - off power - law with a hard spectrum , @xmath3 , is heavily intrinsically absorbed by a cold gas with @xmath78@xmath5 .",
    "the reflected radiation arrives to the observer unabsorbed , or significantly less absorbed , than the intrinsic emission .",
    "the upper limit on the absorbing column density of the reflected component is @xmath79@xmath5 based on the model 4 test .",
    "the reflecting material is neutral and located far from the black hole , as suggested by the width and energy of the fluorescent iron k@xmath7 line , and the ionization parameter of the reflected component . when this best fit model is applied to the _",
    "swift_/bat data , we find a normalization constant between the two data sets , @xmath80 .",
    "the right panels in figure  [ fig : ratcb ] show data - to - model ratios ( models 13 ) in the _",
    "swift_/bat energy range .",
    "the figures indicate that the model 3 scenario is favored and we plot the model and its components in figure  [ fig.eeuf]a .      in this section",
    "we apply the best fitting _",
    "model ( model 3 ) to the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "figure  [ fig.ratx]a shows the ratio of the _ xmm - newton _ data to model 3 with parameters fixed at the values fitting best the _ chandra _ data .",
    "a soft excess below 2kev is clearly visible , and is due to the diffuse emission of gas surrounding the nucleus collected from a large extraction region required by the _ xmm - newton _ psf . to account for this difference we thawed the temperature and normalization of the thermal bremsstrahlung component in model 3 ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ) .",
    "the fit in the soft band improved significantly , although certain residuals indicative of emission / absorption lines were still present .",
    "since we are interested primarily in the continuum agn emission , we do not improve further on the soft ( @xmath83kev ) residuals and focus on modeling the spectrum at energies @xmath2kev .",
    "the resulting data - to - model ratios are plotted in figure  [ fig.ratx]b .",
    "the temperature @xmath81 is lower than in the case of the _ chandra _ spectrum ( although consistent within the uncertainties ) and close to the temperature of the thermal component in the _ chandra _ background model . residuals below and above @xmath84kev are still apparent indicating that the intrinsic spectral properties of the nucleus might have changed between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the shape of the residuals suggests that either the intrinsic absorption column varied ( model excess below 4kev ) or the normalization of the power - law varied ( model deficit above 4kev ) .",
    "we test both possibilities .",
    "first we thaw the intrinsic absorption column ( in addition to @xmath81 and @xmath82 ; model 3a in table  [ tab.mpar ] ) and repeat the fit .",
    "we obtain an increased intrinsic column density , @xmath85@xmath5 , with respect to that in the _ chandra _ observation .",

    "the fit resulted in @xmath87 ( 191 d.o.f . ) .",
    "next , we test the hypothesis that the spectral variability is due to the variable normalization of the power - law , @xmath88 ( model 3b in table  [ tab.mpar ] , figure  [ fig.ratx]d ) , while the intrinsic absorption and reflection parameters remain fixed at the values obtained from the analysis of the _ chandra _ data . to correctly account for the constant absolute flux of the reflected component",
    ", we release the condition that the normalization of the reflected component is equal to the normalization of the power - law .",
    "instead , we fix the normalization of the reflected component at the value found in the _ chandra _ data .",

    "we note , however , that this parameter is subject to large errors in the _ chandra _ data .",
    "this spectral variability scenario results in an increased equivalent width of the iron line ( observed ew@xmath90ev , intrinsic ew@xmath91ev ) as compared with the _ chandra _ model 3 .",
    "a combined variability scenario ( i.e. , both @xmath92 and @xmath88 allowed to vary ; 190 d.o.f . ) resulted in parameter values and cstat consistent with those of model 3b .",

    "we tested several spectral models , and concluded that model 3 in table  [ tab.mpar ] provides the best fit to our _ chandra _ data supplemented by the _ swift_/bat data . in this model",
    "the 2200kev x - ray emission of the central agn is decomposed into a strongly intrinsically obscured hard cut - off power - law continuum ( @xmath94 ) , and significantly less absorbed reprocessed emission including a neutral reflection hump and an accompanying neutral narrow iron k@xmath7 line .",
    "the soft 0.52kev x - ray band is dominated by a thermal diffuse emission , and may contain a marginal contribution of a scattered power - law component .",
    "the same model applied to the earlier _ xmm - newton _ data led us to explore two x - ray variability scenarios .",
    "in the first one , the variability is apparent and caused by the variations of the intrinsic column density . in the other , the variability arises due to changes of the normalization of the power - law emission .    the hard x - ray spectrum , renewed nuclear radio activity ( van breugel et al .",

    "2007 ; liuzzo et al . 2009 ) , and weak optical continuum dominated by the host galaxy ( van breugel et al . 1986 ) suggest an analogy between the state of the nucleus in 4c+29.30 and a hard or hard - intermediate spectral state of galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( gbhs ; see e.g. , fender et al .",
    "2004 ; done et al .",
    "the spectral ages of large scale radio structures in 4c+29.30 differ by @xmath95myr .",
    "this timescale , when scaled down by the ratio between the black hole mass in 4c+29.30 ( @xmath11m@xmath12 , section  [ sec : bhmass ] of the present paper ; paper i ) and that of a typical gbh ( @xmath96m@xmath12 ) , is comparable with the time between consecutive outbursts of gbhs ranging from years to decades ( for examples of gbhs with at least two documented activity periods see e.g. , table  1 in remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; figure  2 in done et al .",
    "thus , it is possible that we observed 4c+29.30 at an early stage of its renewed nuclear activity , which could have started as recently as several decades ago , judging by the spectral age of the youngest nuclear radio structures .",

    "<S> the hard ( @xmath2kev ) x - ray spectrum of 4c+29.30 can be decomposed into an intrinsic hard power - law ( @xmath3 ) modified by a cold absorber with an intrinsic column density @xmath4@xmath5 , and its reflection ( @xmath6 ) from a neutral matter including a narrow iron k@xmath7 emission line at the rest frame energy @xmath8kev . </S>",
    "<S> the reflected component is less absorbed than the intrinsic one with an upper limit on the absorbing column of @xmath9@xmath5 . the x - ray spectrum varied between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a scenario invoking variations of the normalization of the power - law is favored over a model with variable intrinsic column density . </S>",
    "<S> x - rays in the 0.52kev band are dominated by diffuse emission modeled with a thermal bremsstrahlung component with temperature @xmath10kev , and contain only a marginal contribution from the scattered power - law component . </S>",
