    "dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , incorporating semiconducting and magnetic properties within a single compound , are very promising materials for spintronics ( and spintronic devices ) and are also important for understanding many fundamental questions such as the origin of ferromagnetism in a semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "the interesting properties of dms arise from the significant role played by magnetic exchange interactions in addition to the interactions widely studied in the conventional semiconductor structures , namely , the electron - electron coulomb and electron - phonon interactions , interactions with strains and random potentials resulting from the defects and inhomogeneous distribution of impurities .",
    "the currently most widely studied dms materials are those based on iii - v semiconductors , in particular mn - doped gaas @xcite . in such materials , if the mn concentration is not too high , mn substitutes ga acting as an acceptor , so doping gaas with mn yields both local magnetic moments and free holes  @xcite .",
    "one of the important lines of research here should be evidently related to the low - dimensional and , especially , two - dimensional structures given the planar character of existing microelectronic devices .",
    "in addition , heterostructures @xmath0-doped by mn will exhibit 2d ferromagnetic behavior , which is qualitatively different from 3d ferromagnetism as there is no continuous phase transition in 2d .",
    "nevertheless , only a limited number of studies dealing with the 2d dms structures have been reported in the literature  @xcite . in refs .   concerning the gaas / algaas heterostructures @xmath0-doped by mn",
    ", the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state was found at rather high temperatures .",
    "however , the hole gas in these heterostructures was not quite two - dimensional since the mobility of charge carriers was so low  @xcite that broadening of the quantized subband levels ( @xmath2300 mev ) exceeded even the depth of the quantum well ( 150260 mev ) in this case .",
    "such low mobility values were the result of a high density of mn , which is responsible not only for the magnetism of the system but is also an acceptor and thus an efficient scattering center .",
    "in addition , the authors of refs .   aimed to provide the highest hole density just in the vicinity of mn ions to maximize the curie temperature @xmath3",
    "the gaas / in@xmath4ga@xmath5as / gaas quantum - well structures @xmath0-doped by mn exhibiting ferromagnetic ordering and a true 2d carrier energy spectrum were obtained by selective doping that ensured a high hole mobility ( more than 2000 @xmath6 at 5 k )  @xcite .",
    "the true 2d behavior in dms heterostructures was also observed in the similar structures elsewhere ; however , in these cases , the fm ordering manifested itself only at the millikelvin range of temperatures  @xcite .",
    "two mechanisms underlying the fm ordering in the 2d gaas / ingaas / gaas heterostructures @xmath0-doped by mn have been proposed in the current literature  @xcite .",
    "the first model @xcite attributes the fm ordering to the indirect interaction of mn atoms by means of holes in a 2d conducting channel .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism is based on the large mean free path of 2d carriers due to their remoteness from the mn layer . in the second model ,",
    "fm ordering arises within the mn layer , possibly mediated by the holes in the layer like in usual dms structures @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant questions is the effect of fm ordering on the temperature dependence of resistivity , in particular , the relation of the fm ordering to the resistance anomaly ( a peak or shoulder ) near @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "several theories have been proposed  @xcite for explaining the resistivity in bulk dms but we are not aware of any theoretical work on transport properties of 2d dms heterostructures .",
    "in addition to magnetism , the disorder plays a significant role in the dms transport properties  @xcite , but again the parameters of the disorder and its effect on transport properties of the 2d dms structures have not yet been thoroughly investigated . in particular , a theoretical analysis providing quantitative agreement with measurements and taking into account disorder effects and peculiarities in the temperature dependence of resistivity is still required .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of spatial disorder of dopant concentration in the @xmath0-layer on the electronic properties of the 2d hole gas and show how at low carrier density , the competition of disorder and nonlinear screening results in the formation of `` metallic '' droplets separated by insulating regions .",
    "we make estimates for the droplet sizes and interdroplet distance , the energy level spacing in these droplet structures and the potential barrier separating neighboring droplets . using these as parameters in a simple model for the resistivity that incorporates the effect of ferromagnetism on interdroplet tunneling",
    ", we obtain a quantitative explanation of the temperature dependence of resistivity in the dms ferromagnetic structure with the 2d quantum well .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section   [ sample - setup ] describes the experimental setup and the samples studied in this paper . in section  [ experiments ] , we discuss the available experimental evidence proving the two - dimensionality of the hole gas and the existence of ferromagnetic correlations in our samples .",
    "the model of nanoscale inhomogeneities of the hole gas is developed in section   [ droplet - model ] . in section  [ sec : resistivity ] , we introduce a simple model for the resistivity that incorporates the effect of energy level quantization in the droplets and ferromagnetic correlation of electrons in neighboring droplets .",
    "section  [ discussion ] contains a discussion of our findings and their implications for the mechanisms of ferromagnetism in the dms heterostructures .",

    "the structure consists of an in@xmath4ga@xmath5as quantum well ( qw ) inside a gaas matrix with a mn @xmath0-layer separated from the qw by a gaas spacer of width 3 nm .",
    "the qw thickness @xmath7 was about 10 nm and the in fraction in it was @xmath8 a carbon @xmath0-layer ( @xmath9 ) was introduced at a distance 1015 nm below the qw just at the top of the buffer layer to compensate the hole depletion of the qw by the ( undoped ) buffer layer .",
    "the quantum well and the surrounding gaas layers were grown by mocvd at @xmath10c while the mn @xmath0-layer and gaas cap layers were prepared by the laser plasma deposition at @xmath11c .",
    "the detailed description of such structures was obtained from x - ray studies reported in ref .  , and the methods of their growth were described in detail in ref .  .",
    "the x - ray results of ref .   demonstrate that the mn layer is slightly smeared forming a ga@xmath12mn@xmath13as region @xmath14 nm thick and with a maximum mn content @xmath15 and not overlapping significantly with the quantum well .",
    "this is also confirmed by the values of hole mobility in the studied structures , which we find to be more than by two orders of magnitude higher than those in traditional bulk mn - doped gaas samples  @xcite .",

    "the two - dimensionality is confirmed by our observation of shubnikov - de haas oscillations and of the quantum hall effect .",
    "we expect that the transport is mostly due to light holes because of the large splitting between the light and heavy hole @xmath29 subbands ( about 90 mev for in@xmath4ga@xmath5as for @xmath30 )  @xcite .",
    "this splitting arises from the biaxial strain caused by the lattice mismatch of gaas and in@xmath4ga@xmath5as and results in light mass behavior of holes ( see ref .   and references therein ) .    to find the actual value of the effective mass in our structures , which is important for calculations of the energy levels in quantum wells and for the adequate interpretation of the transport data , we performed cyclotron resonance and shubnikov  de haas ( shdh ) oscillations measurements ( see fig .",

    "were performed at the toulouse high magnetic field laboratory ( lncmp ) using a long - pulse coil , delivering magnetic fields up to 40 t with a total pulse length of 800 ms .",

    "we have performed measurements using samples with different mn content to understand the effect of disorder and doping on the crossover from the metallic - like to insulating behavior .",
    "this crossover is also affected by the degree of ionization of the mn dopants as we will see below .",
    "samples for transport measurements were prepared by photolithography and have a hall - bar geometry of width 0.3 mm between the hall probes and 1.5 mm between resistance probes .",
    "measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of sample resistance and hall effect were performed in the @xmath34 k temperature range at magnetic fields up to 3 t.",
    "the main purpose of this paper is the quantitative description of disorder and peculiarities of temperature dependence of the resistance @xmath35 in 2d dms structures . in this part of the paper , we summarize and present experimental results needed for this quantitative explanation .",
    "for that , we need first , to recall that the metal to insulator transition occurs in dilute magnetic semiconductors with increase of mn content , to present the data confirming that it indeed takes place in 2d heterostructures , such as our samples , and to provide arguments for its percolative nature ; second , to illustrate the 2d character of the electron energy spectrum in our case ; third , to provide evidence for fm correlations ; and fourth , to present experimental data on peculiarities of @xmath35 related to fm ordering . here",

    "this suggests that we have a set of samples ranging from very insulating to nearly metallic .",
    "note that strictly speaking even the most `` metallic '' samples are not the classical metals since their resistance , although rather low , increases with lowering temperature in the range 40100 k. samples 2 and 3 also show a larger mobility at 5 k compared to 77 k , which is indicative of metallic behavior while sample 1 has lower mobility at 5 k , as should be the case with an insulator .",
    "note also that the resistivity of our samples turns out to be of the same order of magnitude as the value @xmath37 , at which the metal - insulator transition occurs in 2d dms structures  @xcite .",
    "the existence of well pronounced shubnikov  de haas ( shdh ) oscillations in samples 2 and 3 tells us that these two samples are on the metallic side of the percolation transition . in fig .",

    "the inset shows shdh oscillations previously discussed in ref .  . in general ,",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the resistance is determined by both the proximity to the ferromagnetic transition and quantum corrections .",
    "our low - temperature ( @xmath38 ) negative magnetoresistance occurs evidently not due to any spin phenomenon but is related to the destructive effect of the magnetic field on quantum corrections to the sample conductivity related to interference of scattered carriers as was pointed out for bulk dms materials in ref .  .",
    "in fact , in the range 0.040.3 t , the observed conductivity is proportional to @xmath39 as it should be for weak localization corrections in 2d .",
    "in contrast to the results of ref .  , where quantum corrections to conductivity were studied in a similar structure doped by c instead of mn , we did not observe antilocalization . in our case , the absence of antilocalization is due to the hole spin splitting caused by ferromagnetic ordering .",

    "in contrast to samples 2 and 3 , sample 1 is quite insulating , with @xmath40 the resistance @xmath35 exhibits an arrhenius behavior ( activation energy @xmath41 k for @xmath42 k ) with crossover to the hopping regime at temperatures less than 30 k ( see fig .",

    "thus , we have a wide enough set of samples on both sides of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we believe that this transition is of the percolation type because , as we find below , the parameter @xmath48 near the percolation threshold is greater than unity ( @xmath49 is the hole mean free path or scattering length ) . for the above mentioned set of samples",
    ", we will calculate in theoretical part parameters of fluctuation potential ( or disorder ) and the electronic structure in the quantum well , which consists of metallic droplets separated by insulating barriers .",
    "the insulating samples are most interesting as they can give us valuable insights into the mechanism of ferromagnetism in these dms heterostructures and we will concentrate on these samples .",
    "we believe all the studied samples are close to the percolation transition since all of them demonstrate some features of both metallic and insulating behavior .    \\2 . for comparison with the theoretical calculations , we need to prove that the hole gas in our samples has a 2d energy spectrum .",
    "the 2d character of samples 2 and 3 is proved by shdh oscillations , which are observed only when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the sample plane as seen in the inset of fig .",

    "near the percolation transition , a sample consists of `` metallic '' droplets and insulating regions , and in 2d , the hall constant @xmath50 is related to the conductivity @xmath51  @xcite as @xmath52,\\label{eq : hall}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the fraction of the metallic phase , and the subscripts @xmath54 and @xmath55 refer to the insulating and metallic regions . under conditions of finite tunneling between metallic droplets ,",

    "[ fig : resistance - data ] .",
    "the fact that this feature is observed for all samples doped by mn but is absent for sample 5 doped by c instead of mn shows that it has a magnetic origin .",
    "the direct evidence of fm ordering for samples 1 and 4 was through the observation of a hysteresis loop in the magnetization curve  @xcite .",
    "the observation of anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in all mentioned samples  @xcite is yet another evidence .",

    "there are differing opinions on whether the anomaly in @xmath35 or @xmath57 should be accepted as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "while it is justified for the case of bulk metals to associate the temperature , at which the anomaly occurs , with @xmath58 we will show below that in the 2d case , the situation is quite different .",

    "the holes in the 2dhg are provided by mn acceptors distributed in a @xmath0-layer with density @xmath59 , which is spatially separated from the quantum well by a gaas spacer with thickness @xmath60 we thus have two interacting subsystems - the @xmath0-layer , where the mn atoms are a source of holes as well as of magnetism owing to their spins , and the quantum well , where the behavior of the holes is affected by the charge and spin of mn atoms .",
    "in addition , the holes in the 2dhg are known to affect the distribution of magnetization in the @xmath0-layer .",

    ", it has been shown @xcite that the interplay of disorder ( due to random potentials of the charged mn atoms ) and nonlinear screening by the holes can lead to inhomogeneities in the carrier density .",
    "the physical picture of droplet formation and metal - insulator transition is as follows .",
    "charge fluctuations of the ionized mn acceptors create a fluctuating potential for the hole gas in the quantum well .",

    "we put the main emphasis on the two most insulating samples .",
    "the insulating samples are particularly interesting to us for they provide valuable insights into the mechanism of ferromagnetism in the dms heterostructures .",
    "we showed how at low carrier density the interplay of disorder in the spatial distribution of the dopant atoms and screening effects by the holes in the 2d quantum well leads to electronic phase separation in the quantum well .",
    "for this phase , we obtained the typical size of the hole droplets , their mean separation , and their energy levels . unlike conventional nonmagnetic gaas / algaas heterostructures ,",
    "a two - subband model was used here as the carrier density was much larger in these heterostructures .",
    "we introduced a simple nearest - neighbor hopping model for the resistivity of this droplet phase taking into account the discreteness of the energy levels in the droplets and the effect of ferromagnetic correlations between spins on neighboring droplets .",
    "the values of the parameters in the resistivity model were obtained from droplet model where possible .",
    "the ferromagnetic parameters such as the curie temperature were varied to fit the observed data .",
    "a good agreement with the experiments was obtained . to our understanding",
    ", ours is the first theoretical study of the transport properties of 2d dms heterostructures .    an important understanding that emerged from our study concerns the relation between the position of the peak or shoulder in the resistivity data and the curie temperature .",
    "unlike 3d dms systems where such resistance features are found in the vicinity of the curie temperature ( and above it ) , we showed that in 2d dms heterostructures , the peak or shoulder - like features are not completely determined by the curie temperature , and furthermore , the curie temperature is typically substantially larger than the temperature at which such features are observed .",
    "physically , this is because the resistivity changes once the magnetic correlation length becomes comparable to the interdroplet separation .",
    "clearly , the divergence between the curie temperature and the position of the resistivity peak will be stronger for the more insulating samples .",
    "our calculations of the resistivity are independent of the microscopic mechanism of ferromagnetism since @xmath178 and @xmath1 are phenomenological parameters .",
    "nevertheless a study of the dependence of @xmath178 and @xmath1 on sample parameters such as @xmath159 @xmath220 @xmath110 can give us crucial clues .",
    "two main possibilities are that ( a ) the ferromagnetic ordering takes place in the mn layer by some intrinsic mechanism such as the zener indirect exchange mediated by holes in the @xmath0-layer  @xcite , whereas the holes in the 2d transport layer merely respond to the mn spin polarization , and ( b ) the ferromagnetic ordering of mn atoms is mediated significantly by the holes in the 2d transport layer  @xcite . for mechanism ( a ) , the transition temperature will be insensitive to the spacer thickness @xmath110 as well as @xmath77 however , one must be very careful in obtaining the transition temperature information from the resistance data .",
    "the position of the anomaly in resistance , sensitive to both @xmath197 and @xmath58 and @xmath146 is affected by the spacer thickness @xmath60 thus , even if @xmath1 is independent of @xmath221 the position of the anomaly in the resistance data does depend on @xmath110 . a better test of mechanisms ( a ) and ( b ) is possible with the insulating samples . note that as the sample becomes more insulating , the separation @xmath146 of the droplets will increase and the interdroplet tunneling will decrease exponentially with @xmath222 if the magnetism is mediated by the holes in the 2d layer , then @xmath58 which is of the order of the strength of the magnetic interaction will be proportional to the interdroplet tunneling probability , which depends on the carrier density as @xmath223 since @xmath224 .",
    "another clue is provided by the values of @xmath1 , which we extracted from the fits of the resistance data for samples 1 and 4 with our model .",
    "we found that @xmath1 for the more insulating sample 1 was significantly larger than that of sample 4 .",
    "one way to understand this result is by observing that the mn doping density @xmath59 is larger in sample 1 , which implies stronger magnetic interaction of the mn atoms .",
    "this seems to support the possibility ( a ) of an intrinsic mechanism .",
    "`` metallic '' samples discussed here are more likely to have both mechanisms contributing to ferromagnetism .",
    "we have seen that the localization length @xmath102 for the hole wavefunction in the gaas region is of the order of 1 nm in all our samples .",
    "this compares well with the estimated localization length in ref .  .",
    "an rkky mechanism of ferromagnetism in a metallic sample leads to a @xmath225 for mn atoms in the @xmath0-layer that decreases exponentially with the distance to the spacer layer as @xmath226 .",
    "mn atoms lying closer to the quantum well can however give larger curie temperatures .",
    "we thus believe that the insulating samples are ideally suited for resolving the question of mechanism of ferromagnetism .",
    "in addition to resistivity measurements , temperature dependent anomalous hall effect measurements can give us valuable clues to the mechanism of ferromagnetism .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare the values of the curie temperature extracted from our resistivity fits and from the temperature dependence of the anomalous hall effect .",
