    "electron tunneling has provided valuable insight into the physical properties of solid state systems .",
    "measurement of the current through stationary tunnel junctions has been used to elucidate the density of states in superconductors and many - body properties of metals and semiconductors . through much theoretical effort , a satisfactory theoretical description of the tunneling process in condensed matter has been attained .",
    "recently , microfabrication techniques have progressed to the point where it is now possible to make extremely compliant vacuum tunneling electrodes which may not remain mechanically stationary during the tunneling process . in the following work we consider the effect that such motion within an elastic tunneling barrier may have upon electron tunneling characteristics . since , to our knowledge",
    ", previous studies of this question have been phenomenological @xcite , we shall attempt to present a more complete theoretical approach to this problem .",
    "we investigate the characteristics of the tunneling current through a square potential barrier where the barrier is fixed on one side and is allowed to oscillate freely on the other .",
    "the goal of this work is thus to predict the effect of a mechanically compliant electrode , which can recoil from a tunneling process , on the current - voltage characteristics and its first and second derivatives .",
    "mathematically this results in the treatment of a localized phonon representing the movable part of the barrier .    in order to treat this problem in a many body approach which can be extended to more realistic situations than the simplified model considered here",
    ", we use a theory treating translationally non - invariant systems under non - equilibrium situations developed in a series of papers by caroli , combescot , nozires and saint - james @xcite ( hereafter referred to as ccns ) based on the keldysh non - equilibrium perturbation formalism @xcite .",
    "the theory gives a rigorous derivation of an energy dependent transfer term from first principles , thereby extending the first , more phenomenological approach of bardeen@xcite , and it allows for a treatment of the phonon perturbation in the usual diagrammatic theory .    the principle introduced in ref .",
    "can be used to treat a non - equilibrium situation such as occurs in metal insulator metal ( m - i - m ) tunneling .",
    "it consists of making one or more partitions in the system , allowing for a separate treatment of regions in equilibrium .",
    "the separate parts are then joined through an appropriate transfer term . for an arbitrary one - electron potential caroli _",
    "et al_. showed that this method yields an exact treatment .",
    "ccns then derived in ref . the well - known expression for the tunneling current @xmath0 through a rigid square barrier for a quasi - equilibrium situation . even though the series of papers starts with a discrete model , ccns",
    "later make a transition to a continuous representation which we use for the calculations in the present paper .",
    "they then consider electron - phonon interaction effects in two following papers @xcite , but the discussion of the effects remained incomplete since a treatment of real phonons is rather involved .",
    "the reason is that , for many body potentials , the evaluation has to be done more carefully , as renormalizations due to many body effects will always depend on the whole system rather than just pieces of it .",
    "however in special cases such as the one presented here , it can be shown that a simple approximation will work very well .",
    "our physical system consists of a mechanically - compliant cantilevered metal tip of mass @xmath2 , placed a small distance @xmath3 from a stationary bulk metal counter - electrode ( see fig .",
    "the movable tip assembly , which we shall refer to as the `` cantilever '' , is modeled as a spring with hooke s law force constant @xmath4 .",
    "electrical contacts are made to the tip and the counter - electrode .",
    "a voltage @xmath5 is applied across these electrodes and the resulting characteristic of the current @xmath6 is measured as a function of the applied voltage . in our model hamiltonian of the system ,",
    "the metal tip is considered to be a single - mode harmonic oscillator with characteristic frequency @xmath7 . assuming a quasi equilibrium situation of equal fermi energies @xmath8 and the simple case of equal work functions for both sides",
    ", the resulting potential barrier can be approximated by a square barrier with barrier height @xmath9 .",
    "the oscillation of the cantilever simply adds an additional degree of freedom , resulting in a modulation of the barrier width on one side ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . hence our quantum mechanical hamiltonian reads    @xmath10\\text { }   \\label{a1}\\ ] ]    where the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the tunnelling electron and the cantilever respectively , while @xmath13 is the instantaneous displacement of the cantilever from its equilibrium position , and @xmath14 is the corresponding momentum .",

    "is expanded to first order in @xmath13 , which yields @xmath16 $ ] @xmath17 . in order to apply a many body treatment to this problem",
    "we follow the approach of ref . and split the system into two halves by adding an infinite potential barrier in the middle of the unperturbed barrier .",
    "we thus obtain two sub - parts similar to the appendix of ref . with the potential terms @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for @xmath21 for the right hand side medium and @xmath22 @xmath23 for @xmath21 and @xmath24 , for @xmath19 for the left one ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . as in ref . we shall assume that these two resulting sub - parts are semi - infinite in the direction perpendicular to the barrier , while at the same time having a finite cross sectional area @xmath25 on which we impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in second quantized notation the hamiltonian for the right side reads @xmath26 where the @xmath27 the root mean square zero point displacement of the cantilever , and we use @xmath28 .",
    "also the variable @xmath29 labels the coordinate perpendicular to the barrier . in this representation",
    "the wave functions @xmath30 are the @xmath29-dependent components of wave functions @xmath31 which diagonalize the system when the unperturbed barrier is included ; we will discuss their explicit form later .",

    "the unperturbed green s functions for both parts of the system have been calculated in the appendix of ref . and will be used as the starting point for further calculations .",
    "following ref .",
    ", to calculate the current we first obtain a self energy correction for the unperturbed green s functions of our system , which are then used to determine the corrections for the function @xmath34 introduced in ref . , eqs .",

    "( also see below for definitions . )",
    "the first order terms in the s - matrix expansion for the self energy vanish , and so we consider the second order direct and exchange diagrams ( see fig .",

    "a three dimensional calculation for the green s function is used to provide a more realistic situation than the one dimensional model introduced by caroli _",

    "since our system is not translationally invariant we must resort to a dyson equation in coordinate representation for the direction perpendicular to the barrier .",
    "we make the approximation , which will be justified in the following , that only the electronic subsystem on the right will receive any corrections from coupling to the mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "as the calculations for the unperturbed green s functions on both sides are analogous , we will confine ourselves to calculating @xmath39 , the propagator of the right subsystem . ultimately , as shown in ref .",

    "the self energy corrections will be small and the largest contribution to the self energy will come from the second order direct and exchange diagrams ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "higher order diagrams will only contribute as @xmath69 , which in our case is certainly small .",

    "the single mode phonon propagator is defined as @xmath75 the fact that there is no integration over the parallel momentum in the exchange term results from the fact that the electron - cantilever interaction is invariant in the transverse direction .",
    "the direct term from ( [ b5 ] ) is not of any further interest , since it just renormalizes the equilibrium position of the cantilever , and we assume that this correction is already included in the definition of the distance @xmath3 . due to the symmetry in the problem",
    "the wave function @xmath76 of the entire system including the rigid square barrier factorizes as @xmath77 where @xmath78 labels the coordinates in the parallel directions in real space and @xmath79 is just a two dimensional plane wave .",
    "we can use this to perform the frequency summation in ( [ b6 ] ) using the representation for @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "( 28 ) of ref . ) , @xmath80 one further conceptual difficulty in calculating an exchange interaction diagram is that an electron can , in principle , travel from the position of the cantilever through the barrier to the fixed electrode , and back again .",
    "*  * this is why we have to take the propagators of the entire system as indicated in ( [ b5 ] ) and ( [ b6 ] ) .",
    "there is an analogous correction to the left side propagator @xmath42 , since an electron could travel to the oscillator position on the right and back again .",
    "these processes would allow the full semi - infinite propagators @xmath39 and @xmath41 to pick up a dependence on the chemical potential on the left hand side and right hand side , respectively .",
    "for the small barrier transparencies considered here , contributions arising from these processes can be shown to be negligible ( see also sec .",

    "in this appendix we derive the range of validity of the zero temperature calculation and establish qualitatively the changes to our results as finite temperature effects start to compete with and finally dominate the intrinsic losses of the mechanical oscillator . the first zero temperature approximation which entered our calculation from before was in ( [ b10.7 ] ) for the matsubara self energy .",

    "the principle value integral is seen to be zero , since the integral is antisymmetric .",

    "the second integral can be recast into @xmath197\\ ] ] @xmath198 if that is compared to formula ( [ b14 ] ) , one sees that the difference for finite @xmath199 is that the integrals now get a smooth cut - off at @xmath200 as opposed to the @xmath15-function cut - off from before . on introducing a finite quality factor",

    "we can thus choose either ( [ ap6 ] ) or ( [ ap6.5 ] ) as a basis of reasoning , depending on the regime considered . as it turns out , for the conceivable range of oscillator quality factors @xmath110",
    ", the linewidths induced by @xmath110 will be very small compared to the temperature broadening , even for temperatures as small as @xmath202 .",
    "thus , we assume for now that @xmath203 and use formula ( [ ap6 ] ) .",
    "the difference in the behavior for the real part of ( [ ap6 ] ) above from its @xmath204 analog can be seen through partial integration : @xmath205 where the integrated term has vanished at the boundaries . in the limit @xmath206 @xmath207 this way one can see how the @xmath120 result for the real part of ( [ b14 ] ) is recovered .",
    "the corresponding integration of the imaginary part gives : @xmath208   \\label{ap8}\\ ] ] which is seen to have a smoothed out step behavior , being essentially constant for @xmath209 and being more or less zero for @xmath210 as is seen in the corresponding expression in ( [ b14 ] ) , with the only difference that the width of the transition is now the width of the fermi distribution , which is approximately @xmath211 it is possible to determine phenomenologically what effect this will have for the most `` observable '' of the peaks , i.e. the ones in @xmath1 .",
    "the peaks in that function are , as we found , determined by @xmath212 .",
    "it can be seen directly from ( [ ap8 ] ) that the derivative of the imaginary part , which gives the strongest contributions to these features , exhibits a pair of lorentzian peaks at the resonance frequency of @xmath213 . at nonzero temperature",
    "these have a width determined by the fermi distribution , as shown in ( [ ap9 ] ) .",
    "one can also see the change in the behavior of the derivative of the real part of @xmath214 from ( [ ap7 ] ) without having to perform the integral . differentiating with respect to @xmath45 gives @xmath215 this can be viewed as being a sum of two convolutions of opposite sign in @xmath216 between the derivative of the fermi function @xmath217 and the two partial fractions of the second factor .",
    "the result of the convolution of these two peaked functions is to a good approximation again a peaked function , where the width of the resulting feature is the sum of the widths of the convoluted components .",
    "since for the moment we assume that the width of our initial peaks ( due to the quality factor @xmath110 ) is practically negligible compared to the thermal width of the fermi function , the effective width of the peaks will also be given by the thermal width .",
    "if , on the other hand , in an intermediate regime ( low @xmath110 , low @xmath199 ) the two effects start to compete one would have to use ( [ ap6.5 ] ) for a correct treatment .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the effect will just be that the widths will add to give the result .",
    "the second @xmath120 approximation was introduced in ( [ c0 ] ) for the current . in analogy to the reasoning above , one can argue that if the fermi factors are kept the smoothed out cut - off will lead to similar effects , which will enhance the total broadening by an additional factor of about two . in summary , we can conclude that the contributions of the quality factor @xmath110 and the temperature @xmath199 to the total linewidth will be about @xmath218 _ q=\\frac 1q } & \\text{and } & { \\ \\displaystyle\\left [ \\frac{\\delta \\omega } { \\omega _ c}\\right ] _",
