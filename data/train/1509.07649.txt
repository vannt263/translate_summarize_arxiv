    "significance of strong gravitational lensing in cosmology has been recognized quite early .",
    "seminal work of @xcite demonstrating possibilities of independent determination of the hubble constant from time delays between images gave momentum to the development of strong gravitational lensing theory .",
    "however , it has only recently been possible to determine the hubble constant from lensing time delays with the precision competitive with other techniques @xcite .",
    "currently , however , goals and performance of cosmology go far beyond `` the quest for two numbers '' ( @xmath5 and @xmath6  the deceleration parameter ) .",
    "with discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite , understanding this phenomenon has become one of the most important issues of modern cosmology .",
    "because there is still no fully convincing hints from the side of the theory , we are left with a pragmatic approach to model this phenomenon as the so called dark energy  hypothetical homogeneous fluid phenomenologically described by the barotropic equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "this approach provides a particularly suitable link between theory and observations .",
    "namely , it encompasses the case of cosmological constant @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and that of the scalar field . if the scalar field settled in an attractor @xcite , @xmath1 can now be constant ( with the fundamental demand that @xmath10 in order to get the acceleration )",
    " this is the so - called xcdm cosmology .",
    "it contains @xmath8cdm as its special case and indeed all constraints on @xmath1 obtained up to now within xcdm cosmology gave @xmath1 very close to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore now there is no debate whether the universe is accelerating , but rather whether @xmath1 coefficient evolved in time in quite recent epochs ( say at @xmath12 ) .",
    "it is a reasonable question because  as lucidly remarked by linder  if the scalar field stands behind accelerating expansion , it should have evolved since the only other case of the scalar field we know ( the inflaton ) clearly evolved because the inflation ended .",
    "a very convenient parametrization of @xmath13 has been proposed by @xcite : @xmath14 , which is essentially the first - order ( linear ) taylor expansion in the scale factor  the true gravitational degree of freedom in frw cosmology .",
    "we will denote this case as cpl thereafter .",
    "the problem is that if we use all conventional cosmological probes like snia , bao or cmbr acoustic peaks , we are facing the degeneracy ( colinearity ) between @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameters ( stemming from the fact that @xmath13 overall should be negative ) .",
    "standard rulers ( like bao and cmbr ) and standard candles ( snia ) when used to constrain @xmath17 and @xmath1 parameters acted complementarily in the sense that their respective confidence regions in @xmath18 plane were almost orthogonal .",
    "no such complementarity has been proposed so far for @xmath15 , @xmath16 parameters , although it has been noticed by @xcite that strong lensing systems are promising in this respect .",
    "it is one of the most important reasons motivating our work .",
    "earlier attempts to use strong lensing systems for constraining parameters of the cosmological model were based on two approaches .",
    "first was the statistical one based on comparison between empirical distribution of image separations in observed samples of lenses and the theoretical one  using class @xcite , or sqls samples @xcite respectively .",
    "second approach made use of galaxy clusters in the role of lenses @xcite where a single lens ( cluster ) typically generates ca .",
    "100 images of ca .",
    "30 - 40 different sources ( distant galaxies ) .",
    "we use another method which can be traced back to the papers of e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , similarly as with the hubble constant , it is only quite recently when reasonable catalogs of strong lenses : containing more than 100 lenses , with spectroscopic as well as astrometric data , obtained with well defined selection criteria are becoming available .",
    "it is also only recently when our knowledge about structure and evolution of early type galaxies allows us to undertake the assessment of such important factor as mass density profile .",
    "recent works @xcite provided first successful applications of the proposed method in the context of dark energy , although small samples have not allowed for stringent constraints .",
    "this encourages us to improve and develop it further . on a new sample of 118 lenses compiled from slacs , bells , lsd and sl2s surveys we constrain the cosmic equation of state in xcdm cosmology and in cpl parametrization .",
    "moreover we relax the rigid assumption of sis model to general power - law density profile allowing the power - law index to evolve with redshifts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we briefly describe the methodology . then , in section  [ sec : data ] we introduce the strong lensing data used in our analysis .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and concluded in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as one of the successful predictions of general relativity in the past decades , strong gravitational lensing has become a very important astrophysical tool allowing us to use individual lensing galaxies to measure cosmological parameters @xcite . for a specific strong lensing system with the intervening galaxy acting as a lens",
    ", the multiple image separation of the source depends only on angular diameter distances to the lens and to the source , as long as one has a reliable model for the mass distribution within the lens .",
    "moreover , compared with late - type and unknown - type counterparts , early - type galaxies ( etgs , ellipticals ) are more likely to serve as intervening lenses for the background sources ( quasars or galaxies ) .",
    "this is because such galaxies contain most of the cosmic stellar mass of the universe .",
    "this property affects statistics of gravitational lensing phenomenon which leads to a sample dominated by early - type galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here , we encounter a critical issue that still needs to be addressed in a systematic way : such properties of early - type galaxies like their formation and evolution are still not fully understood .",
    "fortunately , a sample of well - defined strong lensing systems is now available and can be used to study the mass density distribution in early - type galaxies .    in principle",
    ", the lens model often fitted to the observed images is based on a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model , in which the projected mass distribution is elliptical @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will take a simpler approach and assume spherical symmetry . for a moment we will refer to the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model instead which will then be generalized .",
    "the main idea of our method is that formula for the einstein radius in a sis lens @xmath19 depends on the cosmological model through the ratio of ( angular - diameter ) distances between lens and source and between observer and lens .",
    "the angular diameter distance in flat friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology reads @xmath20 where @xmath5 is the present value of the hubble function and @xmath21 is a dimensionless expansion rate dependent on redshift @xmath22 and cosmological model parameters are : @xmath23 for @xmath0 cosmology or @xmath24 for the cpl parametrization of evolving equation of state .",
    "more specifically , @xmath25 for @xmath0 cosmology and @xmath26 for cpl parametrization .",
    "provided one has a reliable knowledge about the lensing system , i.e. the einstein radius @xmath27 ( from image astrometry ) and stellar velocity dispersion @xmath28 ( form central velocity dispersion @xmath29 obtained from spectroscopy ) , one can use it to test the background cosmology .",
    "this method is independent of the hubble constant value ( which gets canceled in the distance ratio ) and is not affected by dust absorption or source evolutionary effects .",
    "it depends , however , on the reliability of lens modeling ( e.g. sis assumption ) and measurements of @xmath29 .",
    "hopefully , starting with the lens structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey and the more recent slacs survey , spectroscopic data for central parts of lens galaxies became available allowing to assess their central velocity dispersions .",
    "there is a growing evidence for homologous structure of late type galaxies @xcite supporting reliability of sis assumption .    in our method",
    ", cosmological model enters not through a distance measure directly , but rather through a distance ratio @xmath30 and respective observable counterpart reads @xmath31    from one side this circumstance is a complication , but it also offers an advantage .",
    "namely , as we already mentioned , @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameters are intrinsically anti correlated , which makes it difficult to constrain them . in the @xmath32 ratio ,",
    "however a competition between two angular diameter distances may lead to positive correlations between @xmath15 and @xmath16 as discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "constraints on cosmological models using this method have been obtained e.g. in @xcite .",
    "one objection one might rise towards the proposed method is the rigid assumption of the sis model for the lens .",
    "although there are some arguments that inside einstein radii total mass density follows isothermal profile @xcite , one can expect the deviation from the isothermal profile and its evolution with redshift .",
    "the last point theoretically stems from the structure formation theory ( ellipticals as a result of mergers ) and to some extent has been supported observationally @xcite",
    ".    therefore we have to generalize the sis model to spherically symmetric power - law mass distribution @xmath33 .",
    "first , we recall that location of observed images , hence the knowledge of @xmath27 provides us with the mass @xmath34 inside the einstein radius : @xmath35 where : @xmath36 is the physical einstein radius ( in [ kpc ] ) in the lens plane and @xmath37 is the critical projected mass density for lensing @xcite .",
    "finally we have : @xmath38 if one has spectroscopic data providing the velocity dispersion @xmath39 inside the aperture ( more precisely , luminosity averaged line - of - sight velocity dispersion ) , then after solving spherical jeans equation ( assuming that stellar and mass distribution follow the same power - law and anisotropy vanishes ) one can assess the dynamical mass inside the aperture projected to lens plane @xcite and scale it to the einstein radius @xmath40 where @xmath41 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by combining eq .",
    "( [ lensing mass ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dynamical mass ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 now , our observable is @xmath43 and its theoretical counterpart ( the distance ratio ) @xmath44 is given by eq.([observable ] ) .",
    "fractional uncertainty of @xmath45 ( after calculating all relevant partial derivatives and simplifying terms ) is @xmath46 following the slacs team we took the fractional uncertainty of the einstein radius at the level of @xmath47 i.e. @xmath48  the same for all lenses .    theoretically for a single system one could use @xmath39 , but",
    "because we deal with a sample of lenses , we shall also transform all velocity dispersions measured within an aperture to velocity dispersions within circular aperture of radius @xmath49 ( half the effective radius ) following the prescription of @xcite : @xmath50 . in the literature",
    "it has also been denoted as @xmath51 .",
    "we adopt the convention to denote observed angular einstein radius or effective radius as @xmath27 or @xmath52 with the notation @xmath53 or @xmath54 reserved for physical values ( in [ kpc ] ) of respective quantities . in our analysis",
    "however , we will consider two cases : with @xmath39 and @xmath55 . while using @xmath55 , the equations eq .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ newobservable ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ uncertainty ] ) should be modified by replacing @xmath39 with @xmath29 . in principle",
    "( i.e. within the power - law model ) , the use of @xmath39 should work because we rescale to the einstein radius anyway .",
    "however , the use of @xmath29 makes our observable @xmath56 more homogeneous for the sample of lenses located at different redshifts .",
    "one may worry about additional uncertainties introduced into the error budget this way since the measurement of @xmath52 bears its own uncertainty . arguing that fractional uncertainty for the effective radius is at the level of @xmath47 ( like for the einstein radius ) and bearing in mind that in the jrgensen formula @xmath52 is raised to a very small power one can estimate that uncertainties of the effective radius contribute less than @xmath57 to the uncertainty of @xmath29 .    then using routines available within cosmomc package @xcite , we preformed monte carlo simulations of the posterior likelihood @xmath58 where @xmath59 in our fits mass density power - law index @xmath3 was taken as a free parameter fitted together with cosmological parameters @xmath60 .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite and further supported by @xcite , that mass density power - law index @xmath3 of massive elliptical galaxies evolves with redshift . on a combined sample of lenses from slacs ,",
    "sl2s and lsd they fitted the @xmath61 data with the linear relation and obtained @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we also performed fits assuming the linear relation : @xmath63 treating @xmath64 and @xmath65 as free parameters together with cosmological ones .",
    "in order to implement the methodology described in section  [ sec : method ] , we have made a comprehensive compilation of 118 strong lensing systems from four surveys : slacs , bells , lsd and sl2s .",
    "the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ) and the boss emission - line lens survey ( bells ) are spectroscopic lens surveys in which candidates are selected respectively from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) data and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) . boss has been initiated by upgrading sdss - i optical spectrographs @xcite .",
    "the idea was to take the spectra of early type galaxies and to look for the presence of emission lines at redshift higher than that of the target galaxy .",
    "candidates selected this way were followed - up with hst acs snapshot imaging and after image processing : subtraction of the de vaucouleurs profile of the target galaxy , those displaying multiple images and/or einstein rings have been classified as confirmed lenses . for our purpose slacs data comprising 57 strong lenses were taken after @xcite and @xcite . and the bells data containing 25 lenses were taken from @xcite .    lenses structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey was a predecessor of slacs in the sense that combined image and lens velocity dispersion data were used to constrain the structure of lensing galaxies .",
    "however , it was different , because lenses were selected optically ( as multiple images of sources with identified lensing galaxies ) and then followed - up spectroscopically . therefore , in order to comply with slacs and bells , we took only 5 most reliable lenses from lsd : cfrs03.1077 ; hst 14176 + 5226 ; hst 15433 + 5352 after @xcite , q0047 - 281 after @xcite , and mg2016 + 112 after @xcite .",
    "at last the strong lensing legacy survey ( sl2s ) is a project dedicated to finding galaxy - scale lenses in the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) .",
    "the targets are massive red galaxies and an automated ringfinder software is looking for tangentially elongated blue features around @xcite .",
    "if found they are followed - up with hst and spectroscopy .",
    "the data for a total of 31 lenses we include here were taken from @xcite .",
    "our sample is presented in table  1 .",
    "it contains all relevant data necessary to perform cosmological model fits according to our methodology presented in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the einstein radius derivation method is more or less consistent across different surveys considered here . after subtracting de vaucouleurs profile of the deflector ,",
    "the einstein radii were measured by fitting model mass distributions to generate model lensed images and comparing them to the observed images .",
    "the mass distribution of the main lenses was modeled as singular isothermal ellipsoids ( sie ) , while in several systems , an external shear component was also added to describe the lensing effect of nearby groups or clusters . even though individual uncertainties of this procedure are different depending on the survey and on whether the image was taken from the earth or from space ( hst )",
    "there is a consensus that in average the relative uncertainty of the einstein radius is at the level of @xmath47 .",
    "apertures for slacs and bells were taken as @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively according to the source papers .",
    "for lsd and sl2s lenses we have assessed the aperture size from the sizes @xmath68 of the slit reported in source papers .",
    "the last column gives the velocity dispersion within a half effective radius calculated according to jrgensen formula .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the scatter plot of our lensing systems .",
    "one can see that inclusion of the sl2s lenses resulted in a fair coverage of lenses and sources redshifts .",
    "[ fig2 ] presents histograms of lens and source redshift with the contribution of respective surveys over - plotted in the same color convention as in fig .",
    "different surveys have the following median values of the lens redshifts : slacs  @xmath69 , bells",
    " @xmath70 , lsd  @xmath71 and sl2s  @xmath72 .",
    "the above values refer to lenses used by us .",
    "sl2s survey  an ongoing one  is particularly promising for the future since it already reached the maximum lens redshift of @xmath73 .",
    "although the lens redshift @xmath74 and source redshift @xmath75 both cover a wide range in our sample , distance ratio @xmath76 is still confined to a very compact range of values , which leads to poor constraining power for @xmath17 parameter @xcite . therefore in this paper , we fix @xmath17 at the best - fit value @xmath77 based on the recent planck observations @xcite .",
    "this disadvantage of our method , i.e. the necessity of taking a prior for the matter density parameter , is to a certain degree alleviated by the benefit of being independent of the hubble constant which cancels in the distance ratio . consequently @xmath5 and its uncertainty do not influence the results .",
    "performing fits to different cosmological scenarios on the @xmath78 strong lensing sample , we obtain the results displayed in table  2 .",
    "the marginalized probability distribution of each parameter and the marginalized 2d confidence contours are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig6 ] .",
    "we started our analysis with dark energy phenomenon modeled by barotropic fluid having constant equation of state coefficient @xmath1 and we considered two cases of mass density profiles in lenses : a non - evolving power - law density profile and an evolving one ( denoted in table  2 as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively ) . power - law exponents @xmath3 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 were treated as free parameters to be fitted .",
    "first , we consider fits on our sample taking the aperture velocity dispersion @xmath39 as the lens parameter . in the @xmath0 model where @xmath1 is the only free cosmological parameter and",
    "@xmath3 is the mass density power - law index parameter , we obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in the second case , when the power - law mass density profile was allowed to evolve : @xmath83 , the best - fit values for the parameters are @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "one can see that @xmath1 coefficient obtained from the strong lensing sample is consistent with the @xmath8cdm model ( @xmath9 ) at @xmath87 level",
    ". fits on the @xmath3 parameter also reveal compatibility between our sample of lenses and the previous smaller combined sample from slacs , sl2s and lsd @xcite . in an attempt to constrain cosmology with the cpl parametrization describing an evolving cosmic equation of state , we first consider the case that both @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 are free parameters ( denoted in table  2 as @xmath88 ) . by fitting the cpl model to the full @xmath78 sample with @xmath39",
    ", we get the marginalized @xmath87 constraints of the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 . by fixing @xmath3 parameters at our best - fit values ( denoted in table  2 as @xmath93 ) ,",
    "the best - fit values for the two cosmic equation of state parameters are : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we also show the marginalized @xmath87 and @xmath96 contours of the two parameter in fig .",
    "it can be seen that , comparing to the previous analysis with a smaller sample @xcite , fits for @xmath15 and @xmath16 are significantly improved with a larger strong lensing sample .",
    "working on the sample with the aperture corrected velocity dispersion @xmath55 , we find that the dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) agrees very well with the respective value derived from planck observations combined with bao data ( @xmath99 ) @xcite .",
    "constraints on the mass density power - law index parameters ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) are even more consistent with the previous analysis @xcite especially with @xmath29 taken as the lens parameter . in the case of evolving cosmic equation of state ( cpl parametrization ) , we obtain @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 . by fixing @xmath3 parameters at the best - fit values ,",
    "the fits for @xmath15 and @xmath16 are : @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "one can see fairly good agreement between our results obtained by using distance ratio method for strong lensing systems and the concordance @xmath8cdm model . in order to compare our fits with the results obtained using supernovae ia , likelihood contours obtained with the latest union2.1 compilation @xcite consisting of 580 sn ia data points",
    "are also plotted in fig .",
    "6 . for a fair comparison ,",
    "the matter density parameter @xmath17 is also fixed at the planck best - fit value @xmath77 and the systematic errors of observed distance moduli are also considered in the likelihood calculation @xcite .",
    "we see that 1@xmath108 confidence regions from the two data sets overlap very well with each other .",
    "this means that the results obtained on the sample of strong lenses are consistent with the snia fits .",
    "this consistency at 1@xmath108 level is different from earlier results obtained with smaller sample of lenses @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see from fig  [ fig6 ] that principal axes of confidence regions obtained with supernovae and strong lenses are inclined at higher angles that in previous studies @xcite .",
    "this sustains the hope that careful choice of the sample in terms of lens and source redshifts , would eventually realize an ultimate dream to have a complementary probe breaking the degeneracy in @xmath109 plane ( discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "this will be a subject of another study .",
    "our method based on distance ratio for strong gravitational lensing systems may also contribute to testing the consistency between luminosity and angular diameter distances @xcite . as it is well known , these two observables are related to each other via etherington reciprocity relation .",
    "earlier discussions of this issue can be found in @xcite .            in order to study the systematics and scatter in our method we performed the diagnostics of residuals .",
    "plots of relative residuals @xmath110 as a function of @xmath74 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath29 for the case of @xmath0 cosmology , assuming non - evolving mass density profile in lenses , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ residuals ] .",
    "this figure is representative of similar diagnostics for the cpl case and evolving mass density profile .",
    "one can see that there is no correlation between residuals and the redshifts of lenses or sources , as well as with the einstein radius relative to the effective radius .",
    "however , there is a noticeable anti - correlation ( correlation coefficient ca .",
    "-0.6 ) with the velocity dispersion .",
    "this trend is especially pronounced for lenses with @xmath113 .",
    "if one excluded small velocity dispersion lenses the result would be comparable to other diagnostics discussed .",
    "this effect is probably related to recent finings of @xcite who extended slacs survey into lower mass region and found that elliptical galaxies with smaller observed velocity dispersions are more centrally concentrated . in any case , however there is a considerable scatter left ( at the level of @xmath114 ) .",
    "this scatter could be attributable to individual properties of lenses , like their environment or deviation form the spherical symmetry . from theoretical point of view",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that there exists a transformation of mass distribution in the lens that leaves all observables invariant .",
    "this is so called `` mass - sheet '' degeneracy  a topic which has recently revived in the context of double einstein ring lenses @xcite .",
    "however , from the physical point of view one of the main ingredients of the `` mass - sheet '' degeneracy comes from the contamination of secondary lenses ( clumps of matter along or close to the line of sight ) .",
    "such factors have not been considered in our methodology and their proper inclusion is still challenging .",
    "in conclusion , our analysis demonstrates that strong gravitationally lensed systems can already now be used to probe cosmological parameters , especially the cosmic equation of state for dark energy .",
    "one may say that the approach initiated in @xcite can be further developed .",
    "however , there are several sources of systematics we do not consider in this paper and which remain to be addressed in the future analysis .",
    "let us start with simplified assumptions underlying our method .",
    "the first one is related to the interpretation of observed velocity dispersions . in this paper , we adopted the spherical jeans equation to connect observed velocity dispersions to the masses and we did it assuming that anisotropy @xmath115 parameter was zero .",
    "as shown in @xcite and in more detailed way in @xcite ( the equations generalizing our eq .",
    "[ dynamical mass]-[einstein ] to arbitrary @xmath115 can be found there ) anisotropy parameter is degenerated with the slope @xmath3 .",
    "therefore in our approach power - law index should understood as an effective descriptor capturing both the density profile and anisotropy of the velocity dispersions .",
    "this effect clearly contributes to the scatter in our results .",
    "another issue is the three - dimensional shape of lensing galaxies , the prolateness / oblateness of lensing galaxies can systematically bias the connection between the mass and the velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "this effect also contributes to the scatter at high redshifts and might reveal as a systematic effect at low redshifts .",
    "all these effects are hard to be rigorously accounted in context of cosmological studies like in this paper .",
    "recent results on this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "the other systematic is the influence of the line of sight ( foreground and background ) contamination .",
    "the problem has been recognized long time ago @xcite with a heuristic suggestion that adding an external shear to an elliptic lens model greatly improves the fits of multiple image configurations .",
    "@xcite addressed the question of secondary lenses on the line of sight and concluded that the role of secondary lenses is a strong function of source redshift and can be important in 38% of cases for a source at @xmath116 .",
    "high redshift sources are advantageous from the point of view of dark energy studies and at the same time they are challenging from the point of view of line of sight contamination .",
    "one of the most recent studies @xcite trying to quantify the influence of the matter along line of sight on strong lensing used the technique of simulations of many multiple image configurations using a realistic model of light propagation in an inhomogeneous universe model ( based on the millenium simulation ) .",
    "further progress in this direction has recently been achieved by @xcite in a paper accompanied with publicly available code pangloss .",
    "they used a simple halo model prescription for reconstructing the mass along a line of sight up to intermediate redshifts and calibrated their procedure with ray - tracing through the millenium simulation .",
    "finally , as proposed by @xcite , another approach to constrain the power - law index @xmath3 of lensing galaxies is to assume a self - similar mass profile and combine different strong lens systems to statistically constrain the mass profile , which could be combined with the method considered in this paper to break the degeneracy between @xmath3 and cosmological parameters .",
    "inclusion of this combination into cosmological use of strong lensing systems will be a subject of a separate paper .     as a function of lens redshift @xmath74 , source redshift @xmath111 , einstein radius relative to the effective radius @xmath112 and the aperture corrected velocity dispersion @xmath29 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we assemble a catalog of 118 strong gravitational lensing systems from slacs , bells , lsd and sl2s surveys and use them to constrain the cosmic equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider two cases of dark energy phenomenology : @xmath0 model where dark energy is modeled by a fluid with constant @xmath1 equation of state parameter and in chevalier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization where @xmath1 is allowed to evolve with redshift : @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume spherically symmetric mass distribution in lensing galaxies , but relax the rigid assumption of sis model in favor to more general power - law index @xmath3 , also allowing it to evolve with redshifts @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the @xmath0 cosmology show the agreement with values ( concerning both @xmath1 and @xmath3 parameters ) obtained by other authors . </S>",
    "<S> we go further and constrain the cpl parameters jointly with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting confidence regions for the parameters are much better than those obtained with a similar method in the past . </S>",
    "<S> they are also showing a trend of being complementary to the supernova ia data . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis demonstrates that strong gravitational lensing systems can be used to probe cosmological parameters like the cosmic equation of state for dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they have a potential to judge whether the cosmic equation of state evolved with time or not . </S>"
