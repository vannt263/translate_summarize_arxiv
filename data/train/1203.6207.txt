    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "since the temperature is chosen low the population @xmath169 presents an appropriate quantifier for the complete reduced density matrix .",
    "the figure depicts that the discrepancy error for our modified redfield solution ( solid black line ) indeed stays throughout of the order of ( @xmath153 ) for all coupling strengths @xmath153 ; in contrast , for the rqme ( dashed red line ) the discrepancy error grows in absolute value @xmath170 , indicating the inaccuracy in the @xmath22-nd order elements . in the limit ( @xmath171 ) the discrepancy error should vanish",
    ": this holds true only for our modified redfield solution whereas the redfield solution depicts a finite value which indicates that this @xmath22-nd order ( i.e. , being proportional @xmath172 ) solution indeed is not correct to leading @xmath22-nd order .",
    "the temperature does not play a major role , since all the features in the discrepancy error remain the same up to temperatures of @xmath173 k. therefore , for all values of the weak - to - moderate system - bath coupling strengths our modified redfield solution is able to predict the @xmath22-nd order elements correctly , whereas the rqme fails to do so already for small values of ( @xmath153 ) .     for a damped quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "the ( black ) solid lines correspond to our modified redfield solution , the ( red ) dashed lines present the results for the redfield quantum master equation , the ( green ) dotted - dashed lines depict the results for the lindblad solution , while the ( blue ) crosses represent the exact result using negf .",
    "panel ( a ) is for the temperature of @xmath160 and panel ( b ) corresponds to a temperature of @xmath174 .",
    "the remaining parameters used for the calculation are @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath161 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we study the actual population values for the first few levels as a function of @xmath153 for two different temperature .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) corresponds to a temperature of @xmath160 and [ fig:2](b ) is for @xmath174 .",
    "we have opted to plot these two extreme temperatures because for all intermediate temperatures values the features of the plot remain practically the same .",
    "we compare our modified redfield solution ( black solid line ) with the rqme ( dashed red line ) , negf results ( blue crosses ) and the lindblad master equation ( dotted green line ) .",
    "the lindblad master equation is extensively used in the literature@xcite due to its ease in computation and its preservation of positivity .",
    "although positivity is an essential criteria , the lindblad solution for the damped quantum harmonic oscillator case is the canonical distribution@xcite with no explicit dependence on coupling strength . put differently , the lindblad solution always fails to capture the effects of finite system - bath coupling . on the other hand",
    "the rqme depicts severe deviations from the exact result for small , but finite coupling strengths .    in the extreme low temperature regime",
    "the rqme yields negative populations , note the results for ( @xmath175 ) in panel fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) already for weak coupling strengths , indicating that the validity of the solution holds only in the zero coupling limit .",
    "the steady state solution of the rqme has been critiqued before@xcite for producing unphysical , negative populations .",
    "we can now assess that the reason for its breakdown is rooted in the incorrect @xmath22-nd order diagonal elements .",
    "the modified redfield solution matches the exact solution quite well for system - bath couplings @xmath153 as strong as 0.2 , even at low temperatures . at high temperatures our modified solution yields a most impressive agrement with the exact results , extending over sizable regimes of coupling strengths up to @xmath176 . beyond a coupling strength @xmath177",
    "the modified redfield density matrix is no longer positive definite , which is determined upon examining the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ; this indicates a breakdown of @xmath22-nd order perturbation theory beyond this value .",
    "nevertheless , the presented modified redfield solution provides a decisive and salient improvement over the rqme in that the coupling strengths that can be probed accurately becomes sizable .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated via the exact comparison with canonical perturbation theory and extensive numerics that the redfield quantum master equation is inaccurate for the steady state .",
    "this failure is the result of incorrect second order diagonal elements .",
    "this is in the spirit of remarks made before by fleming _ _ et  al.__@xcite .",
    "their suggestion in overcoming this flaw by the use of the fourth order tensor to improve the second order accuracy is numerically extremely cumbersome .",
    "their suggestion to use instead the davies approximation@xcite in order to obtain the thermal steady state reduced density matrix correct up to second order is not appropriate either .",
    "this is so because in case of the davies approximation the long - time limit can be taken only if we take @xmath114 , so that the product @xmath178 remains constant@xcite .",
    "this in turn immediately implies that the davies approximation is precise only to @xmath58-th order accuracy in the long - time limit , where it agrees with the lindblad solution .",
    "attempts have been made to correctly evaluate the second order diagonal elements using the dyson expansion@xcite : in this context it must be noted , however , because the dyson series is _ _ asymptotically divergent__@xcite , and although the off - diagonals in fact agree , the second order diagonal elements are found _ not _ to match the exact result of dhar _ _ et  al.__@xcite for the damped harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "therefore , since most of the perturbative methods fail to capture the effects of finite system - bath coupling in the long - time limit , we put forward a modified solution to the redfield quantum master equation which reproduces the second order elements exactly .",
    "the derivation is based on obtaining the second order diagonal elements from the off - diagonal ones using an analytic continuation procedure as detailed in sec .",
    "[ subsec:3.2 ] .",
    "the result of this scheme is unique indicating a unique steady state for the reduced density matrix . in order to test the validity of our solution ,",
    "we have compared our modified redfield solution to canonical perturbation theory and demonstrated that our modified solution agrees with the generalized gibbs distribution up to second order in the system - bath coupling strength for a general system that is coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath .",
    "this indicates that even in the weak , but finite , system - bath coupling limit the system thermalizes to a generalized gibbs distribution . as will be elaborated elsewhere our method",
    "is also applicable to systems connected with multiple - baths , thus exhibiting nonequilibrium steady state transport@xcite .    as an illustrative example we tested and compared in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] the reduced density matrix obtained by our modified solution , the redfield formalism , and the lindblad master equation against the exact negf results for a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "we find that our modified solution agrees quite well with the exact result for coupling strengths as strong as @xmath179 , showing a major improvement over the rqme which matches the exact result only in the limit @xmath171 . on the other hand",
    "the lindblad solution for the damped oscillator case always yields the canonical distribution , wrongly indicating that the solution is not affected by the system - bath coupling strength .",
    "the presented modified redfield solution further is numerically very efficient ; this is mainly so because with our scenario the computational complexity scales as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the system hilbert space dimension , as compared to @xmath111 for the redfield formalism .",
    "this fact allows us to describe accurately not only the effects of finite system - bath coupling , but as well as to explore systems with rather large hilbert space dimensions .",
    "a yet unsolved challenge consists in the extension of our scheme to the _ time - dependent _ relaxation of the reduced density matrix @xmath180 and , in this context , also the extension to study the differing relaxation processes that stem from different initial preparation schemes away from the typically used case of a correlation - free initial preparation . assuming bath spectral densities that assure an ergodic behavior , the long - time limit is not affected by the initial preparation , being in distinct contrast to its temporal relaxation .",
    "yet another unsolved objective presents the perturbative , accurate study of multi - time correlations of open system observables , both time - homogeneous thermal and time - dependent nonequilibrium correlations beyond the weak coupling limit .",
    "we would like to thank j. l. garca - palacios and meng lee leek for discussions on the accuracy of the redfield master equation , lee chee kong for helpful discussions on canonical perturbation theory , adam zaman chaudhry on the implementation of the master equation , and bijay kumar agarwalla and lifa zhang for insightful discussions . this work has been partly supported ( j .- s .",
