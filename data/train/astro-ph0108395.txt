    "the determination of the chemical abundance distributions in stars often requires the identification and isolation of a suitable set of absorption lines whose individual line strengths , or equivalent widths , are well - defined and can be measured .",
    "these equivalent widths become the primary datasets upon which the abundance analyses of the stars are based .",
    "for early - type stars that have small values of @xmath1 , defining a set of spectral lines whose equivalent widths can be measured accurately is usually a straightforward task , because their spectra are relatively free of blending lines . as rotational velocity increases and spectral",
    "line - widths broaden , however , a point is reached beyond which it becomes impossible to find adequate sets of unblended spectral lines on which to anchor a detailed abundance analysis .",
    "the distribution of projected rotational velocity , @xmath1 , as a function of spectral type increases from f - g stars , where @xmath1 almost vanishes , to ob stars that typically rotate rapidly .",
    "et al . _ ( 1982 ) studied the distribution of rotational velocities in early - type stars and observed that , among hot stars , early b - type stars show the lowest rotational velocities ; @xmath2 .",
    "however , even at the low end , these values of @xmath1 are high enough to blend the absorption lines to such an extent that prevents line identification and individual equivalent - width measurements . in this case ,",
    "spectrum synthesis can be used to model the blended line profiles and extract elemental abundances .    our previous studies of chemical abundances in ob stars - daflon , cunha & becker ( 1999 ) and daflon _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) , hereafter papers i and ii , respectively - analyzed only those observed targets with sharp lines ( @xmath3 ) as the method adopted to derive elemental abundances was based on equivalent - width measurements . due to this restriction , the final list of ob stars analyzed in these previous papers consisted of about 25% of the total number of observed targets for this project .",
    "however , many of the observed stars with relatively high @xmath1 still have conspicuous features in their spectra that can be compared with broadened synthetic line - profiles and thus provide information about their chemical compositions .",
    "this paper focuses on a subset of the observed sample ob stars having @xmath1 between roughly 60 and 140 @xmath4 with the intent being to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances .",
    "four stars are included from paper i ( hd 205948 , hd 207951 , hd 209339 and hd 239729 of the cep ob2 association ) and 3 stars from paper ii ( hd 227696 and hd 228199 of cyg ob3 and hd 202347 of cyg ob7 ) for which stellar parameters were already derived but an abundance analysis was not done .",
    "in addition to these 7 stars , 5 other stars belonging to the cep ob2 association are analyzed here .",
    "the addition of this set of rapidly rotating stars to those with lower projected rotational velocities analyzed already , enlarges our sample of observations for the current study of chemical abundances of ob stars in the galactic disk as much as possible .",
    "in particular , this completes the sample for the study of the abundance distribution and investigation of possible inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of the gas that formed the main - sequence members ( with spectral types between o9 and b3 and for which an abundance analysis can be done ) of the cep ob2 association .",
    "in addition to their usefulness as probes of the general abundance distributions found in the galactic disk and in ob associations , rapidly rotating b - stars can have their surface abundances altered by rotationally induced mixing . in a recent study ,",
    "heger & langer ( 2000 ) have presented surface abundance predictions for elements sensitive to mixing , such as boron , carbon , or nitrogen , in a set of stellar models of differing mass , rotational velocity , and age .",
    "the members of a typical ob association are all formed in the same place , but at slightly different times ( with age differences of @xmath510@xmath610@xmath7 yrs ) , with differing masses and rotation velocities .",
    "mass , age , and rotation are all variables that play a role in the degree of stellar mixing expected . in this",
    "paper certain elements sensitive to mixing , such as , c , n , and o , are analyzed in cep ob2 and the results can be used to test the rotating stellar models .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in papers i and ii , however , a brief summary of the instruments follows .",
    "the data consist of spectra with a resolution of r@xmath5 60,000 , high signal - to - noise ( s / n @xmath8150 ) , covering the spectral range from 42255285  and obtained with the 2.1 m otto m. struve telescope plus cassegrain sandiford echelle spectrometer at the mcdonald observatory of the university of texas .",
    "additional spectra were obtained with the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope , also at mcdonald observatory , and coud spectrometer having r=12,000 and centered on the region of @xmath9 ( 4340 ) .    in paper",
    "i , an effective temperature scale for ob stars was derived using the reddening - free q parameter from ubv photometry .",
    "the t@xmath10-q calibration , when combined with an analysis of the h@xmath11 line - profiles , has been found to be adequate for the derivation of the fundamental stellar parameters , t@xmath10 and log g , needed to conduct an abundance analysis for the main - sequence ob stars .",
    "the adopted stellar parameters for the studied stars are collected in table 1 .",
    "most of these are from papers i and ii and in this study we add the determinations for 5 rapidly rotating stellar members of the cep ob2 association : hd235618 , hd239681 , hd239710 , hd239745 and hd239748 .",
    "all of the additional stellar parameters presented here were derived following the same approach adopted in paper i. ( see that paper for a more detailed discussion of the method ) . lte plane - parallel model atmospheres were then calculated with the atlas9 code ( kurucz , 1991 ) for solar metallicity and a constant microturbulence velocity of 2kms@xmath12 .",
    "these model atmospheres were adopted for both the lte and non - lte abundance analyses .",
    "as a matter of consistency with our previous studies , we tried as much as possible to use the same sets of transitions of c , n , o , si , mg and al selected in papers i and ii .",
    "however , because of the high rotational velocity of the target stars this was not always possible . in particular , the weak lines of c ii , s iii and fe iii become too shallow in stars with relatively high @xmath1 . as a result of this ,",
    "sulfur and iron abundances were not derived in this study . because of the lack of c ii lines , an attempt was made to derive carbon abundances using c iii lines , as we are interested in complementing the sample for carbon as much as possible .",
    "the only possibility was to use the 3 strong c iii lines in the region centered on 4650 , which were not used in our previous papers because these strong lines are very close to a set of o ii transitions and are generally blended , even for stars that appear to rotate slowly .",
    "the selected spectral regions for this abundance study are gathered in table 2 where , in the first column , we indicate the species that is dominant and whose abundance was adjusted in that particular region .",
    "spectral lines used to construct linelists for the syntheses were taken from the kurucz website ( url cfaku5.harvard.edu/ ) and the line gf - values were taken from the opacity project ( op ) , but also from kurucz , when the atomic data needed was not available in the op database .",
    "lte abundances of carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , magnesium , aluminum , and silicon were determined by fitting synthetic spectra calculated with the program linfor ( originally developed by h. holweger , m. steffen , & w. steenbock ) to the observed spectral regions containing the selected individual transitions .",
    "the synthetic profiles were then broadened for @xmath1 and limb darkening using a linear limb darkening coefficient interpolated from the values from table 2 in wade & rucinski ( 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , the synthetic spectra were broadened by the instrumental profile , while the macroturbulent velocity was set to zero ( as suggested by ebbets 1979 for main - sequence b - stars ) . as done in the abundance analyses of the sample of stars with low @xmath1",
    ", the o ii transitions were used to derive microturbulent velocities as these lines are the most numerous in the sample and , most importantly , span a range in line - strength adequate to constrain the microturbulence . as a first step in this analysis ,",
    "the o ii line profiles were calculated for various values of microturbulence .",
    "the @xmath1s in each case were allowed to vary and the best fit oxygen abundance for each profile was determined by means of a @xmath13-minimization .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the type of diagram constructed in order to estimate the microturbulent velocity : this figure displays the behavior of the o ii lines for the sample star hd239745 , where best fit oxygen abundances ( corresponding to seven spectral regions containing o  ii lines ) are calculated for microturbulent velocities ranging from 2 to 10 kms@xmath12 .",
    "such a diagram is the equivalent of the usual ` abundance versus equivalent width ' plot , where a solution is found when zero slope is obtained . by definition , the solution in figure 1 will be the microturbulence value that yields approximately the same abundance for strong and weak lines : for this star a region of coincidence is found around a microturbulent velocity of 8.0 kms@xmath12 .",
    "once a value for the microturbulence was established for each star , lte synthetic spectra were calculated for all of the spectral regions listed in table 2 . here",
    "again the @xmath1s were left as free parameters and adjusted in each spectral synthesis and an individual projected rotational velocity was derived from each fit .",
    "the derived @xmath1s for the individual fits did not , as expected , differ significantly and the average values are presented in the third column of table 3 .",
    "the average lte abundances for the studied elements , their standard deviations and the number [ n ] of fitted lines corresponding to each species are also found in table 3 .",
    "we stress that the carbon results in this table are for c  iii , while those in papers i and ii are from c ii . for one star in the sample ( the cep ob2 member hd239745 ) , however , it was possible to compare the c ii and c iii abudances as , for this star , the c ii lines at @xmath145143.50 , 5145.17 , and 5151.08were strong enough to be fitted : a carbon abundance of 8.22 provides a good fit for the 3 c ii lines , as well as the c iii line whose abundance is listed in table 3 .",
    "such an agreement between c ii and c iii abundances is not always achieved . in the literature ,",
    "a few studies have pointed out that the c iii lines at 4650  usually provide abundances higher than the c ii lines ( e.g. smartt et al . 1996 , rolleston et al .",
    "a discrepancy is also found from inspection of the results given in gies & lambert ( 1992 ) . in order to investigate systematic differences between c  ii and c iii abundances",
    ", we decided to pursue an analysis of the c iii lines in the stars analysed previously in papers i and ii and for which we published c ii abundances .",
    "the results of the comparison will be discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "the lte abundances obtained follow trends found previously , namely that the elemental abundances in ob stars are , in general , sub - solar .",
    "however , a more detailed discussion must await results that take into account non - lte effects .",
    "non - lte calculations for c , n , o and si have already been presented in papers i and ii and proven to be small for the effective temperature and surface gravity range encompassed by the sample stars .",
    "non - lte synthetic profiles were calculated for each observed profile , and , in this study , new non - lte calculations were added for two additional elements : mg and al .",
    "non - lte synthetic profiles were calculated using model atoms by eber ( 1987  c  iii ) , becker & butler ( 1989  n ii ) , becker & butler ( 1988  o ii ) , dufton _",
    "( 1986  al  iii ) , przybilla _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 mg ii ) and becker & butler ( 1990  si iii ) .",
    "the adopted model atoms contain most of the energy levels belonging to the main ionization stages with the addition of the lower levels of the adjacent stages with relevant populations in this temperature range .",
    "the completeness of the adopted model atoms is essential to guarantee an accurate ionization balance and the correct calculation of the level populations .",
    "the models include a number of permitted bound - bound transitions explicitly calculated , as well as transitions from levels fixed in lte .",
    "the level populations were computed with the program detail , assuming ls - coupling to find the solution for the equations of statistical equilibrium and transfer ; the line profiles were computed with voigt profile functions using the program surface . as a first step here ,",
    "non - lte synthetic profiles were fitted to the observed o ii lines in order to determine the microturbulent velocity in a similar manner as done for the lte analysis and discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "the microturbulence derived from o ii lines for each star was then adopted to calculate the synthetic profiles for the species of the other studied elements .",
    "the left panels in figure 2 show synthetic spectra calculated for the region between @xmath144412 and 4419  for hd239748 . in this spectral region , the main contributions to the observed profiles correspond to the o ii lines at @xmath144414  and 4416 . in the top",
    "left panel five synthetic profiles are shown for different oxygen abundances of log @xmath15(o ) = 8.22 , 8.37 , 8.42 , 8.47 and 8.62 and for @xmath1 of 65 km@xmath12 ( as indicated from the @xmath16-minimization shown in the bottom right panel . ) the best fit oxygen abundance is represented by the synthetic profile with a solid line .",
    "it was derived via a @xmath16-minimization which is shown in the top right panel of this same figure .",
    "the bottom panel illustrates the sensitivity of the profiles to the variation of the projected rotational velocities , @xmath1 , ranging , in this example , between 50 and 80 @xmath4 .",
    "similarly to what was done in the lte analysis , a best fit non - lte abundance and @xmath1 value were obtained for each individually synthesized profile and table 4 lists the average abundances and @xmath1s for each target star .",
    "these are the final abundance results for c , n , o , mg , al and si obtained in this study .",
    "the derived @xmath1 values had a small variation from fit - to - fit with standard deviations typically smaller than 10kms@xmath12 .",
    "moreover , these @xmath1s are very consistent with the @xmath1s derived from the lte syntheses . in order to investigate possible spurious trends due to systematic errors in the adopted t@xmath10 scale ,",
    "the non - lte abundances obtained are plotted as a function of the effective temperatures in figure 3 : no major trends are found .",
    "the derived microturbulences in non - lte are in all cases smaller than those derived in lte , with the average being 2 km s@xmath12 less .",
    "since the microturbulence is an adhoc parameter needed in order to obtain an agreement between the abundances of strong and weak lines , it might be expected that a more realistic non - lte treatment would reduce the need for microturbulence .",
    "this seems to be the case , but just slightly , as the derived microturbulences are still significant .",
    "however , this abundance analysis is based upon one dimensional plane - parallel model atmospheres in lte and assume a constant microturbulent velocity .",
    "these models are still far from being able to represent the atmospheres of early - type stars perfectly and the microturbulence remains a required parameter in these calculations .",
    "the uncertainties in the adopted effective temperatures and surface gravities have been discussed in some detail in paper i , with estimated errors of 4% in t@xmath17 and of 0.1 dex in @xmath18 . the uncertainty in the microturbulent velocity is assigned to be about @xmath19 .",
    "the final abundances are the non - lte results and it is the non - lte calculations that were used to investigate the final abundance uncertainties .",
    "non - lte synthetic profiles were calculated for new model atmospheres generated by adding the uncertainties to the adopted parameters for two stars in the sample .",
    "the elemental abundances derived from profile fitting are also subject to uncertainties in the continuum location as well as the choice of the projected rotational velocity . based on the the variation of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath1 , as shown on the bottom panel of figure 3 , an error of 7%",
    "is adopted due to @xmath1 and 5% due to continuum location .",
    "we note that variations in the linear limb darkening coefficient have negligible effects on both the derived values of @xmath1 and abundances .",
    "the resulting abundance uncertainties , as well as the total expected error ( @xmath20 ) , are listed in table 5 .",
    "the total errors are @xmath5 0.100.25 dex , except for c iii , which has a slightly larger error of @xmath50.3 dex that is dominated by the uncertainty in the effective temperature .",
    "the abundances of silicon and magnesium , based on strong lines , are very sensitive to the choice of the microturbulent velocity .",
    "previous abundances presented in papers i and ii were derived from equivalent width measurements . in order to investigate any systematic differences between abundances based on syntheses compared to those based on equivalent widths , all stars analyzed in both papers",
    "i and ii were re - analyzed using the synthesis techniques presented here .",
    "no significant offsets in the abundances were found , with differences typically less than 0.05 dex : both equivalent width and synthesis based abundances can be compared directly .",
    "it is usual to compare stellar abundance results with the abundances derived from the solar photosphere and meteorites .",
    "the sun has been a reference point for obvious reasons . in this respect ,",
    "several abundance studies of ob stars in the galactic disk have noted the subsolar abundance values obtained for these early - type stars . with regard to this comparison , the non - lte abundance results here indicate the same general pattern . for nitrogen and oxygen the derived target abundances are , in general , below the solar value .",
    "some comments should be made concerning the accepted solar oxygen abundance .",
    "two recent studies derive significantly lower solar o abundances than generally accepted earlier values , with prieto , lambert & asplund ( 2001 ) finding log @xmath15(o ) = 8.69 and holweger ( 2001 ) deriving 8.74 . for the time being , we simply average these recent determinations and use log @xmath15 ( o ) = 8.72 as the reference solar value .",
    "this new o abundance for the sun also brings it closer to o abundances found in the ism , with log @xmath15 ( o ) = 8.43 being the gas phase abundance as quoted by sofia & meyer ( 2001 ) : gas phase ism abundances for many elements are expected to be lower than stellar abundances for gas and stars from similar populations as some material in the ism is in the form of grains .",
    "the lower solar abundances also result in better agreement with b stars in general , although these stars still fall below even this lower abundance .",
    "subsolar abundances are also found for al , with the exception of one star for which a solar al abundance was derived . for mg and",
    "si , it is found that four stars are above , or at , the solar abundance level , while the other stars lie below the solar abundance line .",
    "figure 4 shows the non - lte corrections for mg ii represented by @xmath21(lte - non - lte ) .",
    "these are always negative and can be as large as 0.25 dex . on the other hand , the lte results would represent a very good approximation for aluminum , where the differences between lte and non - lte al iii abundances scatter around zero , with absolute values smaller than 0.08 dex ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the corrections for nitrogen , oxygen and silicon are positive for all studied stars and typically smaller than 0.2 dex .    for carbon",
    "the abundance results are close to the solar value but these abundances need further discussion : for the 8 stars for which it was possible to obtain c abundances ( derived in all cases solely from c iii ) , 4 of them have carbon abundances that are very close ( within 0.05 dex ) to the solar value .",
    "we note that the derived carbon abundances here are in general closer to the solar abundance than other results in the literature , including our own in papers  i and ii . this may be a systematic effect due to the choice of different lines and , in particular , different ionization stages : here strong c iii lines and in papers i and ii the weaker c ii transitions .",
    "non - lte c iii corrections with respect to lte abundances are not very large and range between @xmath22 to + 0.06 dex .",
    "these corrections , shown in figure 4 , are not able to bring the c ii and c iii into agreement .",
    "the non - lte corrections for c ii are typically smaller than 0.1 dex .",
    "a comparison of the c iii and c ii abundances was possible for 8 stars from papers i and ii .",
    "the derived results indicate that the lte c iii abundances are higher . for two stars",
    "we see very large discrepancies between the c iii and c ii results ( both in lte and non - lte ) of the order of 0.70.9 dex .",
    "clearly further work is needed to clarify the situation and this is in progress .    taken together",
    ", the mean non - lte abundances for this sample of b stars still point to a general pattern of sub - solar abundances .",
    "average abundances are [ c / h]= @xmath230.15 , [ n / h]= @xmath240.15 , [ o / h]= @xmath250.14 , [ mg / h]= @xmath260.24 , [ al / h]= @xmath270.21 , and [ si / h]= @xmath280.30 . the overall average abundance for all 6 elements , relative to solar , is [ m / h]= @xmath290.13 , or about a factor of 2 lower in metallicity than the sun .",
    "although subsolar , these abundances are still larger than most of the gas phase ism abundances as summarized recently by sofia & meyer ( 2001 ) .",
    "two elements , n and si , are found to be below the gas phase ism abundances .",
    "we note , however , that even for n in the sun this seems to be marginally the case as well , while si has large abundance uncertainties , as noted earlier .",
    "nine stars of this sample belong to the cep ob2 association , which has already been analyzed chemically in paper i by means of equivalent - width measurements of spectral lines in sharp lined stars .",
    "the mean non - lte abundances for a sample of 8 low @xmath1 stars are @xmath30 ( c)=8.17@xmath310.09 , @xmath30 ( n)=7.62@xmath310.10 , @xmath30 ( o)=8.61@xmath310.10 and @xmath30 ( si)=7.21@xmath310.28 . this study may now be complemented with the present sample , for which it is found to have mean non - lte abundances of 8.37@xmath310.15 for carbon , 7.53@xmath310.17 for nitrogen , 8.47@xmath310.14 for oxygen and 7.28@xmath310.33 for silicon .",
    "the average abundances derived from both samples agree quite well for n , o and si , despite the somewhat higher dispersions obtained for the sample of high @xmath1 stars .",
    "carbon abundances are somewhat larger in this sample than in paper i. however , as discussed before , carbon results in this paper are based on c iii , instead of c ii ( as in paper i ) : part of this difference may thus reside in systematic effects between c ii and c iii . if both samples are combined , then the entire set consists of 17 stars belonging to the cep ob2 association and this represents @xmath5 30 percent of all the stars formed in the cep ob2 association with spectral types between o9 and b3 .",
    "these average abundances are then , relative to solar , [ c / h]= @xmath32 , [ n / h]= @xmath33 , [ o / h]= @xmath34 , and [ si / h]=@xmath35 : all underabundant by roughly the same amount .",
    "the mean abundances confirm the results of cep ob2 being slightly metal poor relative to the sun by about 0.2 - 0.3 dex ( the average underabundance of the four elements discussed here is @xmath36 ) .    with the addition of the sample of high @xmath1 stars ,",
    "the number of cep ob2 stars is twice as large as the number presented in paper i and provides tighter constraints on the chemical distribution in the association .",
    "cep ob2 is believed to be divided into two subgroups of different ages : cep ob2a , with an estimated age of @xmath37 years , extending over a large area within the association , and cep ob2b , with an estimated age of @xmath38 years , associated with the open cluster trumpler 37 ( tr 37 ) .",
    "it might be assumed that those stars assigned as members of tr 37 by garmany & stencel ( 1992 ) belong to the younger subgroup ( hds 205794 , 206183 , 206267d , 207538 , 239724 , 205948 , 239729 , and 239748 ) , while the rest of the sample ( hds 206327 , 239742 , 239743 , 207951 , 209339 , 235618 , 239681 , 239710 and 239745 ) belongs to the older subgroup , cep ob2a .",
    "this assumption can be tested by using the derived stellar parameters to construct a variation of an hr - diagram for cep ob2 . the surface gravity ( as log g )",
    "is plotted versus log t@xmath10 and this is shown in the top panel of figure 5 for all 17 cep ob2 members in the sample .",

    "it is clear from this form of an hr - diagram that the cep ob2 members in this sample do generally segregate into two evolutionary groups , with a set of 10 stars falling very near the zams , and a second , somewhat evolved group of 7 stars .",
    "the earlier assumption of assigning age status based on tr 37 membership is a reasonable one : 7 of 8 stars identified as tr 37 members fall on the zams . using the hr - diagram as the discriminator",
    ", 7 stars should be put into the older group ( cep ob2a : hds 206327 , 207951 , 235618 , 239681 , 239724 , 239742 , and 239743 ) , and 10 stars into the younger group ( cep ob2b : hds 205794 , 205948 , 206183 , 206267d , 207538 , 209339 , 239710 , 239729 , 239745 , and 239748 ) .",

    "the behavior of the n / o abundance ratios are investigated more carefully in the bottom two panels of figure 5 , where the log(n / o ) abundances are plotted versus log g ( middle panel ) and @xmath1 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the abundance ratio of n / o is shown , as the ratio is somewhat less sensitive to stellar parameter uncertainties , while surface gravity is used as a measure of evolutionary state ( see the top panel of figure 5 ) , and projected rotational velocity is used to test for rotationally - induced mixing ( heger & langer 2000 ) .",
    "in general ,",
    "the n / o ratios of stars in both subgroups display small scatter , with log(n / o)= @xmath400.13 , however , two n - rich stars do stand out , especially in the middle panel as having lower values of log g ( and are thus more evolved ) .",
    "these two stars are hd235618 and hd239681 and are cep ob2a members . in the top panel of figure 5 , these n - rich stars are the two most evolved stars falling nearly on the 15m@xmath39 model track and also have two of the largest projected rotational velocities ( bottom panel of figure 5 ) .",
    "it should be remembered , of course , that stars with low @xmath1 could also be rapid rotators viewed nearly pole - on , but stars with high @xmath1 values are rapid rotators , thus hd235618 and hd239681 are rotating rapidly .",
    "this suggests that rotation in fairly massive stars has led to mixing of cn - processed material to the surface .",
    "nitrogen enhancements of nearly a factor of two are indicated . in a simple mixing scheme of only cn - processing , the sum of c plus n nuclei will be conserved ; with an assumed starting abundance of @xmath30 ( c)= 8.35 and @xmath30 ( n)= 7.55 , then an increase to @xmath30 ( n)= 7.80 ( as observed ) , would result in a carbon abundance change of only @xmath41 dex : such a change in c would be lost in the noise of the c - abundance uncertainties ( especially in view of the possible differences between c ii and c iii abundances ) .",
    "heger & langer ( 2000 ) have computed models of rotating massive stars ( m= 820m@xmath39 ) that include surface abundance changes caused by rotationally induced mixing .",
    "they find that surface @xmath42n - abundances can increase by about a factor of 2 ( as observed in two of the cep ob2 members ) , in 1220m@xmath39 stars that have rotational velocities greater than about 200 km s@xmath12 and ages of @xmath525 myr .",
    "the two cep ob2 stars with n - abundances enhanced by about + 0.3 dex have masses close to 15m@xmath39 , and ages of a few myr . with projected rotational velocities of 100 and 140 km s@xmath12 , respectively",
    ", these two stars could easily have true rotational velocities of 200 km s@xmath12 or larger .",
    "a test of the mixing hypothesis could be facilitated by a comparison of boron abundances in a sample of these stars .",
    "both the lte and non - lte abundances of c , n , o , mg , al , and si derived here continue to indicate that young o and b stars in this part of the galaxy have slightly subsolar abundances .",
    "the inclusion of c iii lines in this analysis does , however , yield carbon abundances that are somewhat closer to solar than those abundances derived from c ii lines .    with 9 cep",
    "ob2 members in this sample , plus 8 members with low values of @xmath1 studied previously ( paper i ) , the chemical abundances in this association are now better defined and we have probed the chemical composition of the gas that formed the ob stars of this association with stellar masses roughly between 715 m@xmath39 as much possible .",
    "two distinct age subgroups within cep ob2 can be identified based upon the stellar parameters derived here , with both subgroups having similar elemental abundances .",
    "two n - rich stars are identified in the older subgroup , however , and these two stars are both rapidly rotating ( @xmath43 100 km s@xmath12 ) and rather massive ( m@xmath5 15 m@xmath39 ) .",
    "their nitrogen overabundances compare well to those predicted from stellar models by heger & langer ( 2000 ) that include surface abundance changes brought about by rotationally induced mixing .",
