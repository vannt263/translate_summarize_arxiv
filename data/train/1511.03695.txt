    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) pulse characteristics remain poorly understood even though pulses are the most common structures in grb light curves : there is little agreement concerning the physical mechanisms responsible for producing them .",
    "pulse characteristics are difficult to extract due to a mixture of strong spectral - temporal evolution , instrumental and sampling biases , confusion caused by overlapping pulses , and low signal - to - noise measurements .",
    "understanding pulse behaviors is important , as it is difficult to adequately model grb progenitors and outflow without first understanding the mechanism by which pulses liberate energy , and it is difficult to understand pulse mechanisms without first identifying pulse behaviors .",
    "data driven analysis approaches are providing new insights into grb pulse characteristics .",
    "these approaches have both advantages and disadvantages over standard theoretical modeling techniques : they can identify behaviors ( typically clustering and/or correlations ) that theoretical models are not trying to explain and thus may not recognize , but by asking questions about pulse behaviors they do not necessarily couch these questions in the form of specific theoretical models .",
    "data driven approaches have allowed the identification of important pulse characteristics even as theoretical models have been unable to explain these behaviors .    as an example , consider empirical light curve models , which can be used to provide an accurate representation of grb pulse behaviors in the absence of identified pulse physics .",
    "several empirical models are able to adequately explain the general shapes of grb pulse light curves ( e.g. see the introduction in @xcite ) . among these ,",
    "the simple model of @xcite is useful because it has only four free parameters which allow reasonable fits over the wide range of observed pulse characteristics .",
    "empirical approaches demonstrate that grb pulse light curves can be generally represented by a _ hard - to - soft _ spectral evolution .",
    "pulses are generally hardest at the first instant they appear , and they continue to soften during the pulse rise , past the pulse peak , and through the pulse decay @xcite .",
    "although hard - to - soft evolution is the most common pulse evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) , _ intensity tracking _ pulse evolution has been identified in a smaller number of pulses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate what fraction of pulses exhibit intensity tracking behaviors , since there are many cases where overlapping hard - to - soft pulses appear to have been misclassified as intensity tracking @xcite .",
    "hard - to - soft spectral evolution is so central to grb pulse structure that it can be used as a defining characteristic in rigorous statistical modeling techniques @xcite .",
    "the harder a pulse is , the more pronounced the evolution typically is .",
    "a small percentage of pulses appear to harden during the pulse rise , but these _ intensity tracking _",
    "pulses are typically among the very softest , suggesting that instrumental biases might be in part responsible for the initial soft emission . several of the well - known correlated spectral - temporal grb pulse properties are simply a result of this hard - to - soft spectral decay : rapid hardness evolution produces short duration pulses with short spectral lags while slow hardness evolution produces long duration ones with long lags .",
    "the relationship between pulse asymmetry and hard - to - soft evolution is not as clear as the one between duration , lag , and evolution .",
    "asymmetry is anti - correlated with hardness and correlated with duration across a large batse grb pulse sample such that asymmetric pulses are generally longer and softer than symmetric pulses @xcite .",
    "this implies that asymmetric pulses in general do not undergo a significant hardness evolution , since the softening is mild and occurs over a long time interval .",
    "however , some of the faintest , softest , longest grb pulses are symmetric and undergo very little hard - to - soft evolution , while some asymmetric pulses are quite hard . to further confuse matters , the bright , short pulses in classical short grbs are also symmetric yet very hard ; undergoing a rapid hard - to - soft evolution . without an obvious connection between hard - to - soft evolution and pulse asymmetry , the possibility exists that asymmetry and hard - to - soft evolution are independent or semi - independent pulse characteristics .",
    "grb pulses ( at least those belonging to the long and intermediate grb classes ) exhibit additional intensity fluctuations that overlay the hard - to - soft monotonic pulse component @xcite ; these fluctuations can be seen in the residuals obtained by subtracting the @xcite modeled monotonic pulse shape from the light curve .",
    "these fluctuations , which have the appearance of three peaks separated by two valleys , are more easily observed in high signal - to - noise pulses ; this makes bright pulses look like they have variable , multi - peaked light curves , in contrast to the smooth monotonic light curves of fainter pulses .",
    "when combined with spectral softening , bright pulses appear to be composed of at least three peaks , with the first one ( during or immediately preceding the pulse rise ) generally being the hardest , the second ( and brightest ) one being of intermediate hardness , and the last one ( during the long decay ) being soft .",
    "hard - to - soft evolution and phased non - monotonic intensity fluctuations can be used to help determine if a grb emission episode is composed of a single pulse or of several merged pulses . a single pulse , at least in the energy ranges of batse and fermi , has pulse residual parameters that correlate with the pulse asymmetry .",
    "the residual light curve waves can be fitted by a simple four - parameter empirical model @xcite    this empirical model has several interesting features : 1 ) the basis of the model is a truncated bessel function of the first kind , @xmath0 that begins at the true pulse peak , 2 ) the wave can be modeled by a mirror image of itself in time , with the time - reflected part occurring during the pulse rise and the time - forward part occurring during the pulse decay , 3 ) the pulse decay portion is a time - stretched version of the mirrored part on the pulse rise , and 4 ) most if not all of the pulse residual fit parameters correlate with the pulse asymmetry . at the present time , no physical mechanism is known that can provide these observed model characteristics .",
    "it is the reproducibility of the light curve residual fluctuations , combined with the overall hard - to - soft spectral evolution , which demonstrates that the fluctuations all combine to form a single evolving pulse with a non - monotonic shape .",
    "all pulse light curves seem to undergo multiple intensity increases and decreases",
    ". however , the definition of a pulse being composed of several monotonically rising and falling regions may be a semantic one : a single pulse might indeed be composed of three separate , linked , smaller pulses .",
    "if we do choose to believe that each fluctuation identifies a separate pulse , then the coupling between these fluctuations and the overall hard - to - soft evolution indicates that multiple pulses always combine to form similar , temporally - linked , complex shapes that need to be described by a single smooth hardness evolution .",
    "the grbs used to measure pulse residual fluctuations have thus far all been those observed by batse and fermi s gbm experiment .",
    "since these instruments have spectral responses favoring detection of higher energy photons ( 25 kev to 2 mev ) over lower ones , it is reasonable to wonder whether these residual features are present at lower energies observed by swift , or if they are primarily a high energy phenomenon . to this end",
    ", we examine a sample of single episodic bursts observed by swift .",
    "the swift grbs analyzed here were observed between august 1 , 2005 and september 1 , 2009 , and were selected by eye from a sample having measured redshifts as being those having single emission episodes .",
    "the initial sample contains 30 grbs .",
    "similar to batse , single - pulsed bursts appear to comprise roughly one - third of all swift grbs ( one - quarter if the sample is limited to to long bursts ) .",
    "light curves are composed of 64 ms , mask - weighted , background - subtracted , 4-channel data available from swift .",
    "the swift four - channel data are similar to those used for batse and fermi gbm , but optimized to the swift energy range ( channel 1 @xmath1 kev , channel 2 @xmath2 kev , channel 3 @xmath3 kev , and channel 4@xmath4 kev ) .",
    "the technique used for extracting pulses from grb light curves has been described elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite and references contained therein ) .",
    "intervals in the light curve where pulses may reside are first identified using the bayesian blocks approach of @xcite , followed by a pulse - fitting technique that fits the empirical model of @xcite to each interval using a nonlinear least squares routine @xcite . for batse and fermi gbm data ,",
    "poisson statistics are assumed . for swift data ,",
    "intensity uncertainties are gaussian , and this requires a modification of the bayesian blocks code ( norris 2014 , private communication ) .",

    "similarly , the pulse peak time occurs at time @xmath13 . in obtaining the pulse fit , the start and end time values of each bayesian block",
    "are used to obtain initial estimates of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , while the maximum amplitude occurring during the block is used * to * estimate @xmath7 .",
    "observable pulse parameters are defined from the four free pulse fit parameters .",

    "the pulse _ asymmetry _ @xmath19 is also defined from the intensities at @xmath15 of the maximum value , and it has a value of @xmath20^{-1/2};\\ ] ] it ranges from a value of @xmath21 for a symmetric pulse to @xmath22 for an asymmetric pulse with a rapid rise and slow decay .",

    "it is not intuitively obvious what roles each of these four free parameters plays in the residual fit , we have included examples in which we vary each parameter individually within the fiducial time interval .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1a ( varying @xmath31 ) , figure 1b ( varying @xmath30 ) , figure 2a ( varying @xmath32 ) , and figure 2b ( varying @xmath33 ) . for these residual models",
    "we have assumed that the underlying pulse has an asymmetry of @xmath36 , and that the fiducial timescale is defined to encapsulate a pulse of this asymmetry .",
    "the fiducial values can be converted back to measured values using the following relationships : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath27 and @xmath25 are the real time values corresponding to the start and end of the fiducial duration .",
    "a convenient way to describe the pulse residual amplitudes is to normalize them to the pulse fit amplitudes , because the result is independent of the instrument s signal - to - noise , allowing amplitude comparisons between different instruments .",
    "this produces a relative amplitude @xmath41 defined by @xmath42",
    "we apply these pulse - fitting techniques to our sample of 30 swift grbs having single emission episodes , with our initial hypothesis being that each emission episode represents a single pulse .",
    "we feel justified in making this assumption because the @xcite results suggest that the residual pattern underlies all isolated pulse structures .",
    "this hypothesis is testable ; a pulse exhibiting the residual wave structure should have residual wave properties that correlate with the pulse asymmetry in the manner found previously for batse pulses .",
    "thus , we fit the swift 4-channel grb data using the @xcite model and the techniques described by @xcite , but we increase the ncp prior variable ( a prior value for the number of change points occurring in the light curve ) in the bayesian blocks code @xcite and/or the level of dual timescale peak flux significance @xcite so that only a single fitted pulse is returned for each grb in the sample .    even though the swift grb sample has been selected from what appear to be bright single - pulsed bursts observed during a predetermined time period , many of the light curves are relatively noisy with large uncertainties .",
    "this is not surprising , as grb emission typically decreases at lower energies where background noise increases . as a result",
    ", the four - channel pulse fits are generally not as good as those obtained for batse and fermi gbm data , and two bursts ( grb 080129 and grb 090313 ) can not be fitted using the @xcite pulse model .",
    "the results of the @xcite fits to the other 28 pulses in the swift sample are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we attempt to fit the remaining 28 pulses with both the @xcite model and the @xcite residual fit model .",
    "we use a _ @xmath43 difference test _",
    "@xcite to determine if the fit has been improved with the addition of the @xcite residual fit . in this test",

    "a resulting probability of @xmath48 is obtained for a @xmath44 value having @xmath46 degrees of freedom .",
    "pulse plus residual fits having @xmath49 do not show significant improvement with the additional model parameters and are excluded , while pulse plus residual fits having @xmath50 are significant enough to be retained .    as shown in table 2 ,",
    "only eleven pulses in our swift sample satisfy the @xmath50 criterion : grb 051111 , grb 060206 , grb 060708 , grb 060912a , grb 061004 , grb 061021 , grb 070318 ,",

    "it seems possible that _ all _ grb pulses might be characterized by a pulse model that includes the same residual wave pattern found in the batse data , but that this residual pattern becomes harder to measure for faint pulses . to test this hypothesis on our isolated pulse sample",
    ", we check to see if the residual pattern is easier to identify when pulses are bright .",
    "we use the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath51 defined as the peak 1 s pulse intensity divided by the peak 1 s pulse intensity uncertainty ; these intensities are available for swift in table 1 and for batse and gbm from published online grb catalogs .",
    "the @xmath51 values depend on both instrumental sensitivity and instrumental energy response . in figure 14",
    "we compare our measure of the fit improvement ( @xmath52 $ ] ) to the @xmath51 for each pulse ( a large @xmath53 value represents an improved fit ) .",
    "a spearman rank order test applied to batse pulses ( crosses ) yields a p - value of @xmath54 that @xmath55 and @xmath51 are uncorrelated while a similar test applied to swift pulses ( filled circles ) yields a p - value of @xmath56 .",
    "the trend also appears to hold for the three fermi pulses ( open diamonds ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that the fits improve significantly as the signal - to - noise increases , which is consistent with our hypothesis .",
    "the pulses not substantially improved by the residual fits also support the hypothesis that the residual wave is present in all isolated pulses : these unimproved pulses are typically among the faintest pulses in the sample .",
    "the mean @xmath51 of the pulses whose fits have been improved ( @xmath50 ) is @xmath57 while the the mean @xmath51 of the unimproved pulses ( @xmath49 ) is @xmath58 a student s t - test indicates only a @xmath59 likelihood that these distributions have the same mean .",
    "the characteristics of the wave patterns extracted from the improved swift grb pulse residuals are found to be similar to those of batse grb pulse residuals in that they exhibit similar correlations with pulse asymmetry @xmath19 .",
    "figure 15 demonstrates the relationship between the variability parameter @xmath32 with @xmath19 , figure 16 demonstrates the relationship between the expansion parameter @xmath33 and @xmath19 , and figure 17 demonstrates the relationship between the fiducial residual peak time @xmath30 and @xmath19 .",
    "these correlations show a clear linkage between the shape of the episode s bulk emission and the more rapidly - varying component contained within the episode .",
    "since the peak of the residuals @xmath30 occurs close in time to the fitted @xcite pulse peak @xmath60 , both @xmath30 and @xmath60 correlate with @xmath19 .",
    "since the residual peaks are closely associated with pulse rise and decay , the stretching parameter @xmath33 correlates with @xmath19 . and",
    ", since an asymmetric pulse has a short rise time relative to a longer decay time , it has a large variability and therefore a large @xmath32 to go with a large @xmath19 .",
    "there is no observed correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath19 , nor is there any clear correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath51 .",
    "figure 18 shows that the mean value of @xmath41 is @xmath61 , which indicates that the residual peak intensity @xmath31 is generally @xmath62 of the fitted peak intensity @xmath7 ; this is true for all pulses in which the residuals can be fitted , regardless of the instrument making the measurements .",
    "pulse residuals describing the pulse shape are just as identifiable in symmetric pulses as they are in asymmetric pulses .",
    "this does not mean that symmetric pulses are as easy to observe as asymmetric pulses : the fitted pulse amplitude @xmath7 has been found to correlate with @xmath19 for batse pulses @xcite , indicating that asymmetric pulses are generally brighter than symmetric pulses .",
    "the residual pattern is not only easier to detect in bright pulses ; it is also easier to detect at higher energies , in pulses with intrinsically larger @xmath63 values , and in asymmetric pulses ( @xmath64 .",
    "figure 19 contrasts the characteristics of pulses that have not been improved by the residual fits ( @xmath65 ; in blue ) with the characteristics of pulses that have been improved by the residual fits ( @xmath66 ; in black ) .",
    "improved swift fits generally require higher @xmath51 ratios than improved batse fits . since batse and swift pulses have similar minimum @xmath51 ratios indicative of comparable instrumental sensitivities , this difference between residual intensities most likely results from the different spectral responses of the instruments , and suggests that the residual structures are more apparent at high energies than at low energies .",
    "the left panel of figure 19 demonstrates an anti - correlation between the normalized residual amplitude @xmath63 and the signal - to - noise @xmath51 : faint pulses with small @xmath51 ratios tend to have larger values of @xmath41 .",
    "unimproved pulses near the threshold tend to balance this anti - correlation somewhat ( this is especially true for batse pulses ) by having smaller @xmath41-values .",
    "the right panel of figure 19 demonstrates that symmetric pulses tend to be fainter and rarer than asymmetric pulses ; most of the symmetric pulses in the sample have low @xmath51 ratios .",
    "overall , we find that eleven out of thirty isolated mask - weighted swift grb pulses are improved by the addition of the residual model .",
    "these pulses exhibit complex shapes consistent with those detected in batse and fermi data , compared to 43 out of 50 batse grb pulses and two out of three fermi grb pulses .",
    "when the potential model improvement resulting from the residual fits is considered as functions of @xmath51 ( figure 14 ) , @xmath41 ( figure 19 , left panel ) , and @xmath19 ( figure 19 , right panel ) , it appears that residual curves may be present in all isolated pulses , but are harder to identify in faint pulses .",
    "it also appears that the residual features are harder to identify at swift s lower energies , even though swift and batse have similar instrumental sensitivities : _",
    "a reasonable interpretation is that the residual features are less pronounced at lower energies . _",
    "finally , residuals are easier to extract when pulses have large normalized residual peaks ( @xmath63 ) ; since symmetric pulses seem to have smaller @xmath41 values than asymmetric pulses , this suggests that there might be an observational bias favoring asymmetric pulses .",
    "figures 20 through 25 summarize the hardness evolutions of the eleven swift grb pulses having measurable pulse shapes .",
    "the swift hardness is defined to be the ratio of counts in the 50 to 300 kev energy range relative to the counts in the 15 to 50 kev energy range . in order to explore how",
    "hardness changes with pulse shape , each hardness plot is marked with the five maxima and minima in the residual light curve : the precursor peak ( downward facing red arrow ) , the dip between the precursor peak and the central peak ( upward facing red arrow ) , the central plateau or peak ( downward facing black arrow ) , the dip between the central peak and the decay peak ( upward facing blue arrow ) , and the decay peak ( downward facing blue arrow ) .",
    "these figures demonstrate the same general hard - to - soft evolution that characterizes batse and gbm grb pulses : the pulse rise phase is spectrally harder than the pulse decay phase .",
    "furthermore , there seems to be a relationship between the times at which pulses harden and the three intensity peaks .",
    "for example , two pulses ( grb 061004 and grb 080413b ) and possibly two others ( grb 070318 and grb 091018 ) have hardnesses that start soft and increase ( reaching maximum hardness at roughly the time of the central peak ) before subsequently decreasing in the normal fashion ; it is interesting to note that these three or four pulses are among the softest in the sample .",
    "additionally , many of the pulses either undergo a brief re - hardening near the time of the decay peak : this is easily noticed for hard pulses grb 051111 , grb 060912a , and grb 061021 yet harder to discern for soft pulses .",
    "table 4 summarizes the visual pulse structure as it relates to the maximum pulse hardness for swift pulses .",
    "we wonder if similar coupled spectral and temporal behaviors exist for the previously - analyzed gbm and batse pulses , and therefore we have expanded the time periods of all plots from @xcite to correspond to the fiducial duration .",
    "even though this redistribution of counts might result in low signal - to - noise , we recognize that the hardness evolution may be important over the entire life cycle of a grb pulses , and particularly in the time intervals corresponding to the residual wave features ( for this analysis , we note that the hardness ratio used batse data is the ratio of counts in the 100 kev to 1 mev energy range relative to the counts in the 25 to 100 kev energy range ) . individual pulse results for forty batse pulses having well - measured hardness evolutions",
    "have been obtained for the entire fiducial timescale @xcite .",
    "the hardness - related temporal structures for the two measurable gbm pulses are summarized in table 5 , while the 44 measurable batse pulse properties are shown in table 6 .",
    "tables 4 , 5 , and 6 demonstrate interesting similarities between swift , gbm , and batse grb pulse evolutions : 1 ) hard pulses tend to have hard precursor peaks relative to the central peak , while soft pulses do not , and 2 ) hard pulses typically demonstrate a re - hardening of the decay peak , while soft pulses do not .",
    "these results appear to be generally valid even though the energy ranges of the experiments are different .",
    "thus , the complex pulse shapes uncovered for batse grb pulses are apparently ubiquitous , and span a larger energy range than just of that detected by batse .",
    "we note the rather remarkable result that the hardness evolution seems to differ for hard pulses and soft pulses .",
    "specifically , hard pulses seem more likely to evolve hard - to - soft while soft pulses are less likely to show this behavior .",
    "furthermore , the times at which pulse evolution changes its decay rate appear linked to the times of the precursor peak , the central peak , and the decay peak .    to explore in greater detail the hypothesis that pulse spectral evolution is associated with the residual structures , we examine the hardness evolution of batse pulses by grouping together those with similar maximum hardness ratios .",
    "since the batse pulses in this sample all have different amplitudes , durations , and background count rates , it is difficult to average their time - dependent hardnesses in a reasonable yet unbiased way . the approach we choose is to sum together the 64 ms photon counts found in like parts of the fiducial window for similar pulses , then ratio these in different energy channels to obtain an evolving counts hardness ratio .",
    "figure 26 indicates the resulting typical hardness evolution of the batse grb pulses , sorted into five groups using individual maximum hardness ratios .",
    "hardnesses are taken by dividing the summed high energy counts ( 100 kev to 1 mev ) in each partition by the summed low energy counts ( 25 kev to 100 kev ) .",
    "hardness groups are hr@xmath67 ( dark blue ) , @xmath68hr@xmath69 ( light blue ) , @xmath70hr@xmath71 ( dark green ) , @xmath72hr@xmath73 ( light green ) , and hr@xmath74 ( orange ) .",
    "similar to the arrows shown in figures 20 through 25 , the down - facing arrows indicate the averaged fiducial positions of the precursor peak , the central peak , and the decay peak , while the up - facing arrows indicate the averaged fiducial positions of the gaps in the residual function between the peaks .",
    "_ this figure demonstrates that all grb pulse groups evolve from hard to soft in that they are softer at the end of their fiducial time intervals than at the beginning ; in this sense all grb pulses evolve from hard to soft_. within this general hard - to - soft evolution , it is also true that grb pulse hardness is reinvigorated at the times of the three pulse peaks . in particular , the precursor peak seems to have a profound influence on the subsequent pulse evolution , since the pulses with the largest maximum hardness ratios have the most abrupt hard - to - soft evolutions and are hardest during the precursor peak , while those with the smallest maximum hardness ratios reach these values during the central peak .",
    "there is weaker evidence in figure 25 for a decrease in the hardness decay during the decay peak than there is for the other two peaks .",
    "@xcite have shown that hardness evolution is a function of pulse asymmetry : the short rise phases of asymmetric pulses cause them to have shorter lags than their symmetric counterparts , and lags are indicative of the rate of hardness decay . in this study",
    "we have found that pulses with larger maximum hardnesses also decay faster , suggesting that maximum hardness should correlate with asymmetry .",
    "figure 27 demonstrates that this correlation indeed exists and is in fact fairly robust : a spearman rank order test yields a p - value of only @xmath75 that these parameters are uncorrelated .",
    "since asymmetry correlates with peak hardness , we expect to see that batse pulses grouped by asymmetry should exhibit hardness evolution that is also related to the timing of the three pulse peaks .",
    "figure 28 demonstrates the effects of this grouping in a manner similar to figure 26 , but using @xmath19 as the key parameter rather than maximum hardness .",
    "asymmetry groups are @xmath76 ( dark blue ) , @xmath77 ( light blue ) , @xmath78 ( dark green ) , @xmath79 ( light green ) , and @xmath80 ( orange ) .",
    "the same general hard - to - soft evolution can be seen in the figure , although grouping the pulses by asymmetry may cause the precursor peak to be weaker than it is in figure 26 , but the rapid decay starting from the central peak is more pronounced .",
    "maximum hardness is potentially a fragile classification characteristic , as is depends on how the hardnesses are binned in time ( e.g. bin size , quantity , and bin center time ) . to assure ourselves that the correlation of pulse evolution with hardness is robust , we group the pulses by hardness ( hr@xmath81 ) as measured from the ratio of the published energy fluences ( @xmath82 ,",
    "where @xmath83 represents some combination of batse energy channels ) :    @xmath84    the results , with hardness groups @xmath85 ( dark blue ) , @xmath86 ( light blue ) , @xmath87 ( dark green ) , @xmath88 ( light green ) , and @xmath89 ( orange ) , are shown in figure 29 .",
    "these hardness groupings are entirely consistent with those shown in figure 26 .",
    "the fact that they are also consistent with those shown in figure 28 demonstrates that grb pulse evolution has a similar functional dependence on both spectral hardness and asymmetry .",
    "isolated swift grb pulses , like their batse and gbm counterparts , exhibit three - peaked pulse shapes even though swift observes the sky at lower energies than batse or gbm .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that grb pulse structure , particularly at high signal - to - noise , can not be adequately modeled by simple monotonically increasing and decreasing functions , and spectrally - dependent variations must be treated as an integral part of each pulse .",
    "isolated pulses generally evolve from hard to soft , although re - hardening often occurs coincident with each of the three peaks .",
    "hard pulses are more likely to have a hard precursor peak and exhibit hard - to - soft evolution throughout .",
    "soft pulses are more likely to have a soft precursor peak , causing them to reach maximum hardness at the time of the central pulse peak .",
    "all isolated pulses are capable of having an additional hardening at the time of the decay peak ; this hardening is most often seen as a change in the rate of hardness decay .",
    "_ these results strongly suggest that the commonly - used nomenclature of ` hard - to - soft ' and ` intensity tracking ' pulses is not correct ; all isolated grb pulses exhibit both behaviors simultaneously and to different degrees .",
    "_    the re - hardening of grb pulse spectra coincident with the three temporal peaks suggests that a single - component evolving spectral model might be insufficient for producing characteristics of isolated grb pulses : it is reasonable to suspect that three separate but overlapping evolving components might exist .",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated through modeling that overlapping hard - to - soft pulses produce a composite hard - to - soft pulse exhibiting intensity tracking behaviors at the peaks .",
    "if each of the three pulse components in isolated grb pulses evolves hard - to - soft , then our simple residual model is inadequate for describing these because it assumes that the first and third peaks are mirror images of one another , whereas the hardness evolution of these events would not be time - symmetric . more detailed , physical models are needed to understand the true nature of the underlying complex grb pulse structure .    the standard model for grb prompt spectral emission is kinematic energy injection into a medium via collisionless relativistic shocks ; the preferred mechanism by which radiative energy is thought to be released is in the form of a synchrotron spectrum ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the physical internal shock model of @xcite , naturally accounts for three separate but temporally overlapping emission regions via a forward shock , a reverse shock , and the region containing the contact discontinuity , and this model may provide a physical basis for the underlying physical structures .",
    "the model also predicts that the shock interactions overlap to a considerable extent , which can make them difficult to unambiguously observed separately .",
    "kinematic models such as this one need to be merged with multi - component evolving spectral models , as recent multiple component spectral models ( e.g. @xcite ) , which thus far have not addressed the possibility that spectral evolution might be associated with specific light curve elements within an individual pulse .",
    "@xcite have considered the radiation mechanisms of kinematically evolving synchrotron shocks , but find that the model better explains observed pulse spectral evolution if ( i ) the distribution of shock - accelerated electrons is steeper than generally assumed , ( ii ) the peak energy dependence is reduced by altering microphysics parameters , ( iii ) the lorentz factor undergoes more pronounced initial variations than previously thought , and ( iv ) the relativistic ejection proceeds with a constant mass flux rather than a constant kinetic energy flux .",
    "@xcite indicate that these conditions are hard to justify , but that their ability to test microphysics conditions are limited by existing data .",
    "further modeling is needed to see under what conditions the synchrotron shock model is consistent with observations .",
    "single - episodic models of grb pulse shapes , such as those in which the asymmetric pulse shape is produced by curvature in a relativistic outflow ( e.g. @xcite ) predict neither the multi - episodic shapes nor the spectral rehardenings observed here .",
    "these models likely need significant modifications in order to explain the observations .",
    "complex grb pulses containing many more than three peaks may be simply the result of observing overlapping light curves from several isolated pulses . however , it is also possible that there are types of grb pulses different than those described here .",
    "_ this latter hypothesis can not even be adequately explored without first having a working definition of a ` gamma - ray burst pulse ' such as has been summarized here for isolated grb pulses . _    the results obtained in this study",
    "allow us to make general predications about the spectral evolution of grb - like pulses at other intrinsic energies .",
    "for example , low - energy bursting events have been observed by transient experiments and include xrfs ( x - ray flashes ) and xrrs ( x - ray rich grbs ) : these appear to be low - energy counterparts to grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the correlated behaviors of x - ray flares ( e.g. @xcite ) and optical flares ( e.g. @xcite ) observed in grb afterglows suggest that these are simply late , low - energy grb pulses . _",
    "the correlated pulse behaviors identified in this manuscript suggest that low - energy pulses should exhibit time histories dominated by intensity tracking spectral behaviors , with a soft precursor peak and potentially a soft or non - existent decay peak .",
    "_ we are currently exploring these possibilities in follow - up studies involving x - ray data and optical / infrared observations using etelman observatory at the university of the virgin islands @xcite .",
    "in this paper and two prior ones @xcite we have re - conceived the observational definition of an isolated gamma - ray burst pulse .",
    "we have been able to do this because isolated grb pulses have complex but well - defined and easily - replicated characteristics .",
    "pulse spectral and temporal evolutions are intertwined in a way suggesting that the underlying physics is orderly and reproducible , even though titanic energies are unleashed through each grb in a relatively short period of time .",
    "this study finds that swift grb pulses exhibit the same general characteristics as batse grb pulses : individual pulse light curves are characterized by triple - peaked profiles that generally evolve from hard to soft .",
    "the three peaks ( the precursor peak , the central peak , and the decay peak ) are aligned to coincide with the asymmetry of the pulse shape .",
    "the precursor and decay peaks can exhibit separate spectral evolution from that of the central peak , causing some pulses to follow intensity tracking evolution overlaying the natural hard - to - soft evolution .",
    "the specific form that the evolution takes depends on the maximum spectral hardness of the pulse : hard pulses begin hard , and the overall hardness decays rapidly throughout the pulse .",
    "however , during the decay , a re - hardening can occur as the decay peak intensity increases . pulses of intermediate hardness have precursor peaks having hardnesses similar to those of the central peak which decay at a moderate rate .",
    "soft pulses can begin soft and harden at the central peak , after which the overall hardness decays slowly throughout the pulse .",
    "the hardness of any pulse can remain constant or even increase during the time leading up to the decay peak .",
    "_ as a result , ` hard - to - soft ' and ` intensity matching ' grb pulse definitions no longer appear to be valid , since all isolated pulses show both of these behaviors in ways that depend upon asymmetry and/or maximum hardness .",
    "_    there is a strong interplay between a grb pulse s hardness and the symmetry of its temporal evolution : asymmetric pulses are generally hard and show a strong hard - to - soft evolution .",
    "symmetric pulses are more often soft and exhibit intensity tracking spectral evolution .",
    "a pulse s duration indicates the timescale over which a system is radiating ; this can be due to radiative cooling and/or to the timescale over which kinematic events occur .",
    "a pulse s asymmetry and hard - to - soft evolution indicate that the rate of cooling is changing and/or that the kinematic events have more energy to release initially than at later times . the triple - peaked nature and spectral re - hardening of isolated grb pulses seems to indicate that energy is injected on as many as three separate occasions during the pulse duration .",
    "theoretical models of grb prompt emission need to account for these observed pulse spectrotemporal characteristics .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the helpful comments of the anonymous referee , as these greatly helped to improve the manuscript . this work has been supported by nasa epscor grant nnx13ad28a .",

    "<S> isolated grb pulses are dominated by hard - to - soft evolution ; this is more pronounced for asymmetric pulses than for symmetric ones . </S>",
    "<S> isolated grb pulses can also exhibit intensity tracking behaviors that , when observed , are tied to the timing of the three peaks : pulses with the largest maximum hardnesses are hardest during the precursor , those with smaller maximum hardnesses are hardest during the central peak , and all pulses can re - harden during the central peak and/or during the decay peak . since these behaviors are essentially seen in all isolated pulses , the distinction between `` hard - to - soft '' and `` intensity - tracking '' pulses really no longer applies . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the triple - peaked nature of isolated grb pulses seems to indicate that energy is injected on three separate occasions during the pulse duration : theoretical pulse models need to account for this . </S>"
