    "the existence of vacuum field fluctuations , and the related vacuum energy density of the field , is a striking consequence of quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory in general @xcite .",
    "vacuum fluctuations have observable effects , for example the casimir force , which is usually an attractive force of quantum origin between neutral macroscopic metallic or dielectric bodies placed in the vacuum space @xcite .",
    "casimir forces originate from the change of the field energy associated with the vacuum fluctuations , when one or more boundary conditions such as dielectric or conducting objects , are changed .",
    "a more thoroughly description of quantum vacuum effects can be obtained by considering local field quantities such as the field energy density .",
    "obtaining the energy densities of the field in the vacuum state is relevant also in view of the fact that they are strictly related to atom - surface casimir - polder dispersion interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the vacuum electric and magnetic energy density , as well as vacuum field fluctuations , can become singular in the proximity of sharp metallic boundaries @xcite .",
    "the presence of such surface divergences of the energy density could be relevant also in view of the fact that they should yield significant gravitational effects because the energy density acts as a source term for gravity @xcite .",
    "new effects arise when one or more boundaries are allowed to move .",
    "a known effect is the dynamical casimir effect , that is the emission of real quanta from the vacuum when a boundary is forced to move with nonuniform acceleration @xcite . for a very small mass of a mobile wall , quantum effects relative to its mechanical degrees of freedom such as position fluctuations , may be relevant .",
    "it is thus worth to consider the effect of a mobile boundary , whose mechanical degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically , on a quantum field ; in this case an effective coupling between the wall and the field arises due to the radiation pressure , as well as an effective coupling between the field modes @xcite .",
    "these effects are also related to the growing field of quantum optomechanics , which studies the coupling of optical cavity modes with mechanical degrees of freedom @xcite ; this subject is also relevant for building more sensitive force detectors , to be used for example for the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the effect of vacuum fields on the position fluctuations of a single mirror in the vacuum space , and the role of vacuum friction , has been recently considered @xcite .",
    "we consider in this paper how a moving conducting boundary such as a cavity wall , being treated quantum mechanically , can affect the field fluctuations and the related field energy density inside the cavity .",
    "this effect can be in principle observed because the field energy density can be probed through the casimir - polder interaction with a polarizable body placed inside the cavity . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have investigated this aspect in the simple case of a massless scalar field in a one - dimensional cavity with one fixed and one mobile wall , and we have found a change of the field fluctuations in the cavity , particularly relevant in the proximity of the mobile wall , and of the casimir force between the cavity walls . also , this new effect , in the case considered in @xcite ,",
    "has a size such that it should allow its experimental observation for a sufficiently small mass of the mobile wall , and masses down to @xmath0 kg can be nowadays reached in modern optomechanics experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the results previously obtained for the one - dimensional massless scalar field to the more realistic cases of a one - dimensional electromagnetic field and the three - dimensional massless scalar field .",
    "we give a local description of vacuum field fluctuations in terms of the zero - point field energy density and local field fluctuations , inside a cavity with a mobile wall , both for the one - dimensional electromagnetic field and the three - dimensional scalar field . in both cases the motion of the mobile wall , which is assumed bound to an equilibrium position by a harmonic potential , is described quantum - mechanically and the effects of radiation pressure and of the wall s quantum position fluctuations are included in the formalism .",
    "our description is based on an appropriate generalization , that we introduce in this paper , of the effective hamiltonian obtained in @xcite for the one - dimensional massless scalar case .",
    "for the one - dimensional electromagnetic case , using a formalism based on the green s functions , we obtain the change of the renormalized electric and magnetic energy densities inside the one - dimensional cavity due to the motion of the cavity wall ; we show that , similarly to the one - dimensional scalar results , it is particularly relevant close to the equilibrium position of the mobile wall .",
    "we also discuss their dependence on the ultraviolet cutoff frequency , that is related to the plasma frequency of the mobile wall , and show that , when the cutoff frequency is increased , the energy - density change becomes more and more concentrated near the mobile wall . in the three - dimensional scalar case , we first obtain the renormalized green s function of the scalar field on the interacting ground state , and we then use it to obtain the renormalized field energy density change in the cavity .",
    "we show that , contrarily to both scalar and electromagnetic one - dimensional cases , the peak of the energy density change is not located at the equilibrium position of the mobile wall .",
    "this peak , however , moves towards the mobile wall when the cutoff frequency is increased .",
    "we also discuss the dependence of the change of the field energy density on the mass and oscillation frequency of the mobile wall , and how the new effects we have obtained can be observed through the casimir - polder force on a polarizable body placed inside the cavity in the proximity of the mobile wall .",
    "although our system has some analogy with the dynamical casimir effect , we wish to stress that it is quite different , because in the present case the mobile wall is not moving according to a prescribed law as in the dynamical casimir effect , but it is described quantum mechanically according to the quantum dynamics induced by the hamiltonian of the interacting wall - field system .",
    "finally , we point out that the results we obtain for the three - dimensional scalar field can be also useful for an extension to the three - dimensional electromagnetic field case .",

    "the presence of quantum field fluctuations in a specific configuration , and the consequent observable quantum vacuum effects , can be understood from the modifications of the emission / reabsorption of virtual field quanta under external constraints . when boundaries are introduced , the propagation is modified due to surface interactions , and consequently this perturbs the homogeneity of the corresponding propagator .",

    "a numerical evaluation carried out for different values of the cutoff frequency shows that when increasing the cutoff frequency , the peak approaches more and more the wall s equilibrium position . finally , we wish to mention that our results for the three - dimensional massless scalar field can be the basis for obtaining the field energy densities for the three - dimensional electromagnetic field too , both for transverse electric and magnetic modes , using the relations outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : local - formalism ] .",
    "we have considered the interaction between a moving conducting wall , whose mechanical degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically , and a field .",
    "we have considered the cases of the electromagnetic field in a one - dimensional cavity and a massless scalar field in a three - dimensional cavity , generalizing previous results obtained for the simpler case of a one - dimensional scalar field .",
    "the movement of the wall , which we have assumed bound to its equilibrium position by a harmonic potential , yields an effective wall - field interaction and an effective interaction between the field modes , mediated by the mobile wall .",
    "for the one - dimensional electromagnetic case , using the green s function formalism , we have been able to obtain the electric and magnetic energy densities , exploiting previous results obtained for the scalar one - dimensional case using the law s effective hamiltonian . for the three - dimensional scalar case ,",
    "we have first generalized the law s hamiltonian , originally obtained only for the one - dimensional case , to our three - dimensional case with dirichlet boundary conditions , and then obtained the renormalized green s function in the interacting ground state . for both cases ,",
    "we have evaluated the corrections to the field energy densities inside the cavity in the dressed ground state , and found that they are particularly significant in the vicinity of the movable wall .",
    "we have also found that these effects become more relevant with decreasing mass and oscillation frequency of the movable wall around its equilibrium position .",
    "we have also discussed measurability of these effects , exploiting casimir - polder interactions with a polarizable body placed inside the cavity , and shown that they should be observable by the optomechanical techniques available nowadays .",
    "finally , we point out that our results for the three - dimensional scalar case could also be the basis for obtaining the renormalized electromagnetic energy densities for the transverse electric modes in a three - dimensional cavity with a mobile wall ; obtaining the transverse magnetic modes would require solving an analogous scalar problem with von neumann boundary conditions",
    ". we shall discuss these points in a subsequent paper .",
