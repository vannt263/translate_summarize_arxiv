    "supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite and its extensions ( for reviews see @xcite ) are scenarios that can reconcile the amplitude of the primordial density perturbations with a gut scale symmetry breaking , without any dimensionless parameters that are very small .",
    "an attractive feature of these models is the relative ease with which the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be explained via leptogenesis @xcite , generated by the right handed neutrinos which arise from the inflaton decay @xcite .    in these models",
    "a @xmath5 symmetry plays an essential role in constraining the form of the superpotential that drives inflation @xcite . a hybrid inflation model with a @xmath6 symmetry , named smooth hybrid inflation ,",

    "we discuss a related new inflation model in which the symmetry @xmath7 again plays an essential role , but unlike smooth hybrid inflation , the inflaton rolls away rather than towards the origin .",
    "while the @xmath5 symmetry , as usual , constrains the superpotential responsible for inflation , the @xmath1 symmetry also plays an important role in controlling the reheat process and leptogenesis .",
    "one of our goals in the paper is to realize new inflation in as natural a manner as possible .",
    "this leads us to consider preinflation which is used to avoid fine tuning the initial conditions .",
    "one possible outcome of this double inflation scenario is a spectral index that can vary significantly with scale as suggested by the wmap analysis @xcite .",
    "we also briefly discuss the possibility of reconciling early star formation with a running spectral index @xcite .",

    ", one would expect these masses to be of order @xmath9 gev , where @xmath10 gev is the ( reduced ) planck scale .",
