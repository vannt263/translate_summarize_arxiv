    "the spin hall effect of light ( shel ) manifests itself as the split of a linearly polarized beam into left- and right - circular components when a beam propagates through homogeneous media .",
    "the splitting in the shel , governed by the angular momentum conservation law  @xcite , takes place as a result of an effective spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the shel is sometimes referred to as the imbert - fedorov effect , which was theoretically predicted by fedorov and experimentally confirmed by imbert  @xcite .",
    "generally the transverse shift of the shel is on the subwavelength scale , and it is difficult to be directly measured with the conventional experimental methods . in 2008 , benefiting from the weak measurement technique , hosten and kwiat first measured the transverse displacement of refracted light  @xcite . the shel has been widely investigated in different physical systems , such as high - energy physics  @xcite , plasmonics  @xcite , optical physics  @xcite , and semiconductor physics  @xcite .",
    "the shel holds great potential applications , such as manipulating electron spin states and precision metrology  @xcite .",
    "the shel itself may become a useful metrological tool for characterizing the refractive index variations of nanostructure .",
    "thus , the relationship between shel and nanostructure is important , yet it is not fully understood . to measure the refractive index variations at subwavelength scale , we need to establish the relationship between the shel and the structural parameters of the nanostructure .",
    "it is well known that the shel manifests itself as the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "now a question arises : what role does the structural parameters of the subwavelength nanostructure play in the spin - orbit coupling ?    in this work , we establish a general propagation model to describe the shel on the nano - metal film and reveal the impact of the structural parameters on the shel .",
    "we find that the spin - orbit coupling in the shel can be effectively modulated by adjusting the thickness of the metal film .",
    "it should be noted that the interesting shel on this structure is different from that on pure glass prism  @xcite , metal bulk  @xcite , and layered nanostructure  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we analyze the shel on the nano - metal film theoretically .",
    "our findings indicate that the transverse displacement of the shel is sensitive to the thickness of the metal film and undergoes a large negative value for horizontal polarization .",
    "next , we focus our attention on the experiment ( weak measurements ) . here , the sample is a bk7 substrate coated with a thin ag film .",

    "it is noted that the real parts of the spin - orbit coupling terms @xmath27 denote the spatial shift of the shel  @xcite .",

    "[ fig2](e ) and  [ fig2](f ) ] which are due to the material properties of the metal film .",
