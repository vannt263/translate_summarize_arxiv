    "would scatter with particles in the galactic environment , and therefore not interact with earth , resulting in galactic - scale effects . in the second , dark matter would interact weakly enough to make it through the galaxy , through earth s atmosphere , and also through a few kilometers of earth s surface before scattering with regular matter .",
    "underground detectors like xenon100 @xcite , and others like cdms @xcite @xcite , cresst @xcite , and edelweiss @xcite @xcite , have ruled out areas of the dark matter mass  cross - section parameter space in this region .",
