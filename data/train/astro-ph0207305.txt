    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of bl lac objects can be largely characterized by two broad peaks .",
    "the low and high energy peaks are commonly attributed to synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering , respectively . depending on the relative strengths of the two peaks ,",
    "it is now customary to divide bl lac objects into low frequency - peaked ( lbl ) and high frequency - peaked ( hbl ) sources ( giommi & padovani 1994 ) .",

    "have shown that the typical multiwaveband sed of an hbl can not be produced from the spectrum of an lbl simply by changing the viewing angle alone .",

    "what is the main physical parameter ( or set of parameters ) that control the seds of bl lac objects ?",
    "recent observations of the host galaxies of bl lac objects provide new clues to understanding the physical nature of these systems .",
    "urry et al . ( 2000 ) and scarpa et al . ( 2000 ) systematically studied the morphologies of bl lac objects using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _  and found that there is no significant difference between the host galaxies of hbls and lbls .",
    "most of the hosts are normal , giant elliptical galaxies , with no obvious evidence for ongoing mergers or strong interactions with other galaxies .",
    "urry et al . ( 2000 ) suggest that , if the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) in bl lac objects correlates with the bulge luminosity of the host galaxy , as is the case in nearby , inactive galaxies ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) , the eddington ratios erg  s@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the bh mass in units of @xmath7 . ] in bl lac objects must span a large range .",
    "a number of authors have suggested that the radio power in radio - loud quasars is controlled by the bh mass ( e.g. , laor 2000 ; lacy et al .",
    "2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ; but see ho 2002 ) .",
    "if the host galaxies of bl lac objects obey the bh mass / bulge luminosity relation , then the peak frequencies are evidently not controlled by the bh mass ( urry et al .",
    "this conclusion has been strengthened by the work of falomo , kotilainen & treves ( 2002 ) , wu , liu , & zhang ( 2002 ) , and barth , ho , & sargent ( 2002a , b ) , who have obtained more robust bh mass estimates using the relation between bh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge ( gebhardt et al .",

    "2002 ) .",
    "if bh mass is not the main parameter , what about the accretion rate ?",
    "the importance of the role of accretion rates in bl lac objects was originally recognized by rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , who suggested that optically thin tori may power their central engines . a number of authors have recently revisited this issue in the context of bl lac objects ( ghisellini & celotti 2001 ;    0.265 cm maraschi 2001 ; bttcher & dermer 2002 ; cavaliere & delia 2002 ; cao 2002 ) and more generally radio - loud quasars ( lacy et al .",
    "2001 ) . using a large sample of objects which covers a wide range of nuclear activity , from nearly inactive systems to classical seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars , ho ( 2002 )",
    "shows that the conventional `` radio - loudness '' parameter is strongly inversely correlated with the mass accretion rate .",
    "this paper presents empirical evidence that the seds of bl lac objects depend on the accretion rate .",
    "the sample of bl lac objects is chosen according to the availability of information on ( 1 ) the luminosity of the host galaxy , ( 2 ) the luminosity of one or more emission lines , and ( 3 ) the fitted peak frequency and luminosity of the sed .",
    "the sample is limited mainly by the host galaxy observations .",
    "relatively large ground - based optical imaging surveys of bl lac objects have been performed by abraham , mchardy , & crawford ( 1991 ) , wurtz , stocke , & yee ( 1996 ) , and falomo & kotilainen ( 1999 ) .",
    "more recently , an _ hst _  survey of 132 bl lac objects was completed by scarpa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and urry et al .",
    "whenever possible , we have given preference to the _ hst _  data because of the high resolution and the uniformity of that sample .",
    "emission - line fluxes come primarily from the studies of stickel , fried , & khr ( 1993 ) , rector et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and rector & stocke ( 2001 ) .",
    "finally , we listed published values of the peak frequencies and the corresponding peak luminosities of the seds ; these are obtained by fitting a logarithmic parabola to the multiwaveband , usually non - simultaneous , continuum .",
    "the final sample , listed in table 1 , consists of 43 objects . for convenience ,",
    "distance - dependent quantities assume @xmath8 km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 and @xmath9 .",

    "( 2000 ) , which used @xmath10 as the criterion to separate the two types , contained some hbls with low peak frequencies ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of @xmath0 for our sample .",
    "there is no obvious bimodality in the distribution ; some objects have `` intermediate '' peak frequencies .",
    "for the subsequent analysis , we somewhat arbitrarily choose @xmath11 , roughly in the middle of the distribution , as the boundary between hbls and lbls . with this criterion , our sample has 17 hbls and 26 lbls .",

    "it is nontrivial to measure the thermal , accretion luminosity from bl lac objects because the bulk of their emission comes from nonthermal processes associated with the jet . in this study , we adopt the strategy of using the observed luminosity of the emission lines to estimate the accretion luminosity of the disk .",
    "emission lines themselves , however , are difficult to measure in bl lac objects because they are both intrinsically weak and heavily diluted by the strong featureless continuum .",
    "nevertheless , they have been detected in a number of sources , and our sample was chosen with this application in mind .    in our sample ,",
    "the most commonly detected emission lines are @xmath122800 ,  @xmath123727 , h@xmath13 ,  @xmath125007 , and h@xmath14 . to estimate the _ total _  luminosity due to emission lines , we follow the method of celotti , padovani & ghisellini ( 1997 ) , who compare the luminosity of the observed lines with the fractional contribution these lines make to the total line luminosity , as    0.3 cm    determined from the relative line ratios computed by francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for a composite quasar spectrum . as in celotti",
    "( 1997 ) , we assume that the total line luminosity @xmath15 . the line luminosities are given in table 1 .",
    "with the assumption that the bulk of the line luminosity is photoionized by the accretion disk ( netzer 1990 ) , @xmath16 should be proportional to the total disk luminosity .",
    "we define a `` line accretion rate '' and its dimensionless form as follows : @xmath17 the relation between @xmath12 and the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath18 is given by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we determine bh masses from the absolute @xmath19-band magnitudes of the host galaxies , using the relation determined by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) from a study of active galaxies : @xmath20 .",
    "this relation is quite similar , but not identical , to that given by kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) for inactive galaxies .",
    "the above estimates of the accretion rates may carry significant uncertainties that are difficult to quantify . while the formal errors on the luminosities of individual emission lines are usually quite modest , what is less certain is the conversion to total line luminosity , as this step implicitly assumes that the relative line strengths in bl lac objects are the same as in typical quasars .",
    "thus , our values of @xmath16 , and hence @xmath4 and @xmath12 , are potentially affected by systematic errors .",
    "the values of @xmath12 are additionally affected by the relatively large scatter in the bh mass versus bulge luminosity relation ( @xmath210.59 dex ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ) . despite the potentially large uncertainties on any individual measurement of @xmath4 or @xmath12 , and their inferred accretion rates",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the _ relative _  values of these quantities , such as those deduced for hbls and lbls discussed below , should be more robust .",
    "figure 2 shows that the accretion rates vary over a rather wide range in lbls , whereas they are more restricted in hbls .",
    "the mean values of the accretion rates are @xmath22(rms dispersion ) and @xmath23 in lbls and @xmath24 and @xmath25 in hbls .",
    "these results directly show that the accretion rate may control the seds of bl lac objects .",
    "it is important to note that the distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath12 significantly overlap between hbls and lbls .",
    "this clearly reflects the continuous distribution of peak    frequencies in figure 1 .    with the assumption that the line luminosity traces the disk luminosity",
    ", the distribution of @xmath12 implies that the vast majority of bl lac objects are highly sub - eddington systems . in such a regime , accretion is thought to proceed via an optically thin `` advection - dominated '' accretion flow ( adaf ; see narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 ) . from mahadevan ( 1997 ) , the total luminosity from an adaf is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the accretion efficiency , and @xmath14 is the canonical viscosity parameter . for a reprocessing efficiency @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 is of the same order as the covering factor of the line - emitting clouds ( @xmath36 ) since the total energy emitted by the clouds is simply the energy absorbed by them ( netzer 1990 ) .",
    "an optically thin adaf can only exist below a critical value of the accretion rate @xmath37 ( narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) . for a plausible value of @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "we find @xmath40 for lbls and @xmath41 for hbls .",
    "this indicates that bl lac objects are in the adaf regime , and that lbls typically have significantly higher accretion rates than hbls .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the findings of ghisellini & celotti ( 2001 ) and cavaliere & delia ( 2002 ) .",
    "we note that equation ( 2 ) may not be applicable to some of the lbls with the highest values of @xmath12 because they have @xmath42 ; these objects straddle the ( uncertain ) transition from a standard disk to an adaf ( cf .",
    "cao 2002 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of the peak frequency ( @xmath0 ) and peak luminosity ( @xmath43 ) on @xmath4 .",
    "we find that @xmath43 correlates strongly with @xmath4 ; the pearson s correlation coefficient is @xmath44 , significant at a level of @xmath4599.999% . treating @xmath4 as the independent variable",
    ", a linear regression fit gives @xmath46 an obvious interpretation of the @xmath47 correlation is that the jet power is directly coupled to the mass accretion rate of the disk .",
    "the disk - jet `` connection '' in active nuclei has been discussed in a number of contexts ( e.g. , rawlings & saunders 1991 ; falcke & biermann 1995 ; xu , livio & baum 1999 ; ho & peng 2001 ) , and the present correlation provides additional support for this picture because the peak luminosity of the sed of a bl lac object represents most of the radiated energy from the jet .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is more complex .",
    "the hbl group and the lbl group each seems to define its own sequence . after excluding three strongly deviant points ( 0922 + 749 , 1229 + 643 and 1458 + 224 ) for 0922",
    "+ 749 was obtained from fitting only three points ( sambruna et al . 1996 ) and is therefore quite uncertain .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for 1458 + 224 .",
    "] , hbls appear to show a moderately strong correlation with @xmath48 at a significance of 98% .",
    "the best - fit linear regression gives @xmath49 the peak frequency formally scales with the accretion rate as @xmath50 , but we note that this is somewhat uncertain because of the limited dynamic range in @xmath4 .",
    "for lbls , we have @xmath51 with @xmath52 and a significance of @xmath53 .",
    "this implies @xmath54 , much shallower than in hbls .",
    "bearing in mind the above caveat on the hbls , the different slopes of the @xmath55 relation may indicate differences in the physical processes associated with the jet , as discussed in the next section .",
    "it is interesting to note that hbls and lbls also delineate different loci , separated by a sharp break , when @xmath0 is plotted against the radio luminosity ( costamante et al .",
    "according to xu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the accretion rate through the disk ( @xmath56 ) is related to the mass flux into the jet ( @xmath57 ) by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the height of the disk at radius @xmath19 and @xmath60 is a constant from 1.7@xmath613.4 . from the distribution of @xmath12",
    ", we inferred that both hbls and lbls contain adafs . since the structure of adafs is quasi - spherical , @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "as blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) argued , adafs inevitably lead to outflows .",
    "if energy is extracted from the spin of the bh via the blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) mechanism , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and the bh spin is assumed to be maximal ( armitage & natarajan 1999 ) .",
    "the bz process has been strengthened by a recent observation of fe k@xmath14 line profile in mcg 6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "this energy will be channeled into two parts : the kinetic luminosity @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the lorentz factor of the jet ) and the radiative luminosity @xmath68 ( seen in the comoving frame of the jet ; e.g. , sikora et al .",
    "1997 ) . here",
    ", we explore the possibility that the relative partition of the spin energy determines the shape of the sed .",
    "in particular , we investigate whether the different functional dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath4 for hbls and lbls can be understood in terms of different radiative efficiencies in the jet .",
    "let us assume that the energy density of the random component of the magnetic field is proportional to the energy density of the relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "then , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mean energy and @xmath72 is the number density of the relativistic electrons . with the help of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is",
    "the radius of the jet and @xmath75 is the proton mass , we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 . if the relativistic electrons have a power - law distribution of energies @xmath78 , the emissivity at the peak frequency @xmath79 in the jet comoving frame is given by @xmath80 ( pacholczyk 1970 ) , and it follows that @xmath81 .",
    "the radiative luminosity in the jet comoving frame will then be given by @xmath82 .",
    "the ratio of the radiative to the kinetic luminosity will be proportional to @xmath83 , which suggests that the higher peak frequencies lead to the higher radiative efficiencies .    for hbls",
    ", we consider the limiting case that most of the energy is radiated . by setting @xmath84",
    ", we have @xmath85 , and the observed peak frequency is @xmath86 here , we have assumed that the doppler factor @xmath87 does not vary strongly with @xmath56 .",
    "we see that @xmath0 depends sensitively on @xmath4 for a given @xmath88 . for a typical value of @xmath89 ( kirk , melrose & priest 1994 )",
    ", we get @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "this is consistent with the empirical results for hbls ( eq .",
    "4 ) . despite the apparent agreement , however , we must regard this result with some caution because of the extreme requirement that the bulk of the jet power emerge as radiative energy .",
    "celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) find that most jet sources do not radiate efficiently , although there are some objects with high radiative efficiencies ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) .    since lbls have lower peak frequencies , their radiative efficiencies are lower , and we postulate that in this case the kinetic luminosity dominates over the radiative luminosity .",
    "the maximum energy of the relativistic electrons will be given by the balance between energy loss and gain .",
    "the acceleration timescale is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the mean free path and @xmath94 in the bohm limit ( inoue & takahara 1996 ) .",
    "the timescale for energy loss due to inverse compton scattering of external photons is @xmath95 , where the energy density of external photons @xmath96 ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) .",
    "we thus have @xmath97 , and the peak frequency is @xmath98 where we used @xmath99 . for the bohm limit ( @xmath94 ) or not very efficient acceleration ( e.g. , @xmath100 ) , the relation will be @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "this , too , is roughly consistent with the empirical correlation for lbls ( eq .",
    "5 ) . in this scenario , which is similar to that discussed by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and bttcher & dermer ( 2002 ) , the peak frequencies in lbls are determined by cooling of relativistic electrons due to inverse compton scattering of photons from the disk or reflected off of the broad - line emitting clouds .",
    "finally , we would like to note that our analysis hinges on the assumption that the emission lines in bl lac objects are photoionized by the disk , such that line luminosity reliably traces the accretion luminosity . based on spectrophotometric monitoring of a sample of high - redshift",
    ", high - luminosity active galactic nuclei , prez , penston & moles ( 1989 ) find that the emission lines vary on timescales shorter than expected from photoionization models .",
    "they suggest that the broad - line region in these objects may be anisotropic .",
    "however , the variability behavior of the broad optical line h@xmath14 in bl lac itself appears to support that `` h@xmath14 emission could be powered by thermal radiation from an accretion disk without significantly affecting the shape ot polarization of the optical continuum '' ( corbett et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "if it turns out that a significant fraction of the line luminosity is powered by the jet instead of the disk , then clearly the interpretation of figure 3 needs to be reevaluated .",
    "however , the conclusion that bl lac objects are highly sub - eddington , advection - dominated systems would not change ; in fact , it would only be strengthened because the inferred accretion luminosity would be even lower than we have assumed .",
    "using a sample of bl lac objects with information on their host galaxies and emission - line luminosities , we show that lbls have significantly higher accretion rates and eddington ratios than hbls .",
    "both classes are highly sub - eddington systems that may be accreting via an adaf .",
    "we find that the peak luminosity of the sed correlates significantly with the accretion rate , lending strong support to the idea that the jet and accretion disk are closely coupled .",
    "furthermore , we present evidence that the peak frequency of the sed also correlates with the accretion rate , although the functional dependence between the two parameters appears to be quite different between hbls and lbls .",
    "we argue that these empirical trends can be qualitatively explained by invoking different radiative efficiencies in the jets of the two classes of objects .",
    "hbls , which have lower accretion rates , evidently manage to convert more of their jet kinetic power into radiation .",
    "by contrast , in lbls , which have higher accretion rates , a greater fraction of the jet power remains in kinetic form .",
    "however , the underlying causal connection between the radiative efficiency of the jet and the accretion rate , and the manner in which energy is channeled into relativistic electrons ( ghisellini , celotti & costamante 2002 ) , remain unclear ."
