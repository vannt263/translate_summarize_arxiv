    "if @xmath0 has no map onto a positive dimensional - projective manifold , it is obviously special too . an equivalent geometric definition of specialness of @xmath0 actually requires that @xmath0 satisfies the more restrictive condition of having no meromorphic map onto an orbifold of general type ( see [ var speciale ] for the precise definition and the relevant notions concerning orbifolds ) .",
    "specialness is preserved by bimeromorphic maps and finite lale covers , this last assertion being surprisingly difficult to show .",
    "special manifolds generalise in higher dimensions the rational and elliptic curves , which are obviously exactly the special curves .",
    "the next fundamental examples of special manifolds are indeed those which are either rationally connected or whith zero canonical dimension ( _ i.e. _ with @xmath15 , see example [ ex varietes speciales ] below ) .",
    "however the class of special manifolds is much larger than the union of these two classes , since one shows by classification that a compact khler surface @xmath0 is special if and only if @xmath16 and @xmath17 is almost abelian",
    ". in particular , ruled elliptic surfaces are special and surfaces with @xmath18 are special if and only if they do not map onto any hyperbolic curve after some finite tale cover .",
    "no such simple characterisation is true when @xmath19 .",
    "the central role of special manifolds in classification theory comes from the fact that , as shown in @xcite , any compact khler manifold is canonically and functorially decomposed by its _",

    "special manifolds and general type orbifolds are thus the _ two _ antithetical building blocks from which arbitrary compact khler manifolds are built in _ one single step_. in contrast to general type manifolds , for which no classification scheme seems to be known or even expected , special manifolds are conjectured to have many fundamental properties in common with rational and elliptic curves .",
    "conjecturally indeed , an orbifold version of the @xmath25 conjecture implies that any special manifold is canonically and functorially decomposed , by means of orbifold versions of the rational quotient and of the iitaka - moishezon fibration , as a tower of fibrations whose orbifold fibres have either @xmath15 , or @xmath26 ( a weak version of rational - connectedness , see @xcite ) .",
    "let us stress that the orbifold considerations are essential here ( as in the lmmp , but for different reasons ) , and that apparently there is no possibility to work in the category of varieties without additional structure .",
