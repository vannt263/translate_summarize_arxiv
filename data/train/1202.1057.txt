    "while being well - studied and understood thoroughly , the dimerized quantum heisenberg models with spatial anisotropy have triggered theoretical interests again recently @xcite .",
    "for example , the 3-d spatially anisotropic quantum heisenberg model with a ladder dimerization pattern is used to demonstrate a universal behavior , which is argued to be relevant for understanding the experimental results of the material tlcucl@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "further , the 2-d dimerized spin-1/2 heisenberg model with a spatially staggered anisotropy is of particularly interesting because this model seems to establish an unconventional phase transition @xcite . specifically ,",
    "although it is believed that the phase transition induced by dimerization for this model should be governed by the @xmath0 universality class theoretically @xcite , a recent large scale monte carlo calculation obtains @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are in contradiction to the established @xmath0 results @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the literature @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the critical exponents corresponding to the correlation length and the magnetization , respectively . in order to clarify this issue",
    "further , several efforts have been devoted to study the phase transition of this model induced by dimerization .",
    "for instance , an unconventional finite - size scaling is proposed in @xcite .",
    "further , in @xcite it is argued that , due to a cubic term , there is a large correction to scaling for this phase transition which results in the unexpected @xmath2 and @xmath3 obtained in @xcite .",
    "later , a monte carlo study indeed provides strong evidence to support this scenario of an enhanced correction to scaling @xcite .",
    "in addition to the staggered - dimer spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice , in @xcite it concludes as well that a similar model on the honeycomb lattice , which is depicted in the bottom panel of figure 1 , as well as the herringbone - dimer model on the square lattice ( middle panel of figure 1 ) also belong to the same category of models receiving an enhanced correction . this general picture regarding the correction to scaling for 2-d dimerized quantum heisenberg models",
    "is indeed supported by several related monte carlo studies @xcite .    while all the available monte carlo results provide convincing evidence for the proposal of an enhanced correction to scaling , the good scaling property of the observable @xmath8 for the staggered - dimer model on the square lattice is the most noticeable observation @xcite , where again @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the spin stiffness in the 2-direction and the spatial box size employed in the simulations , respectively .",
    "inspired by this observation , one naturally would like to examine whether for the staggered - dimer model on the honeycomb lattice and the herringbone - dimer model on the square lattice , a similar good scaling behavior will be observed when considering the same observable @xmath8 for these two dimerized models .",
    "although the phase transition induced by dimerization of the staggered - dimer model on the honeycomb lattice has been studied before , a detailed comparison between the scaling behavior of @xmath11 and @xmath8 as well as the relevant investigation of the exponent @xmath12 are not available yet @xcite .",
    "in addition , to examine how the enhanced correction to scaling , due to a cubic irrelevant term as suggested in @xcite , affects the determination of the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath12 for the staggered- and herringbone - dimer models is an interesting topic to explore as well @xcite .",
    "indeed , whether the cubic term will influence the numerical value of the confluent exponent @xmath13 has not explored in @xcite . hence in this study",
    ", we have investigated the phase transitions of the herringbone- and ladder - dimer spin-1/2 heisenberg models on the square lattice , as well as the quantum staggered - dimer model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "in particular , the largest lattice sizes reached here are as twice large as those of the relevant early studies in some cases .",
    "the results for the ladder - dimer model are included here for completeness and comparison purpose , since the enhanced correction to scaling should be absent for this model .",
    "remarkably , as we will demonstrate later , indeed @xmath8 of the staggered - dimer model on the honeycomb lattice shows a good scaling behavior .",
    "consequently , we are able to obtain a value for @xmath6 , in agreement with the established @xmath14 in the @xmath0 universality class , by employing the leading scaling ansatz in our finite - size scaling analysis for @xmath8 . interestingly , while our monte carlo data for all the models studied here , including the herringbone- and ladder - dimer models on the square lattice , are compatible with the recently proposed scenario of an enhanced correction to scaling for the phase transitions considered here , we find that the enhanced correction to scaling manifests itself as amplification of the nonuniversal prefactors appeared in the scaling forms . in other words ,",
    "our data are in consistence with the established results of @xmath15 , @xmath5 , and @xmath16 in the @xmath0 universality class .",
    "we provide numerical evidence to support this proposed scenario of amplification of the nonuniversal prefactors appeared in the scaling forms , by demonstrating that the values of @xmath13 for the herringbone- and staggered - dimer models are compatible with @xmath16 , through a calculation of relevant observables at the corresponding critical points .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , after an introduction , the spatially anisotropic quantum heisenberg models and the relevant observables studied in this work are briefly described , after which we present our numerical results . in particular , the results obtained from the finite - size scaling analysis are discussed in detail .",
    "a final section then concludes our study .",
    "the heisenberg models considered in this study are defined by the hamilton operator @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are antiferromagnetic exchange couplings connecting nearest neighbor spins @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the models which are described by eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) and are investigated in great detail here . to study the critical behavior of these models near the transition driven by the anisotropy , in particular , to determine the critical points as well as the critical exponent @xmath6 ,",

    "@xmath7 is the inverse temperature and @xmath10 again refers to the spatial box size .",
    "further @xmath25 with @xmath26 is the winding number squared in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "in addition , the second binder ratio @xmath28 , which is defined by @xmath29 is also measured in our simulations as well . here",
    "@xmath30 is the @xmath31 component of the staggered magnetization @xmath32 . by carefully investigating the spatial volume and the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath34 as well as @xmath28",
    ", one can determine the critical points and the critical exponent @xmath6 with high precision .",
    "finally the exponent @xmath12 is determined by studying the scaling behavior of the observables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which are measured in this study as well , at the corresponding critical points .",
    "to study the quantum phase transitions of our central interest , we have carried out large scale monte carlo simulations using a loop algorithm @xcite .",
    "further , to calculate the relevant critical exponent @xmath6 and to determine the location of the critical points in the parameter space @xmath33 for the models described by figure 1 , we have employed the technique of finite - size scaling for certain observables .",
    "for example , if a transition is second order , then at low - temperature for the systems considered in this study .",
    "] and near the transition the observable @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath28 should be described well by the following finite - size scaling ansatz @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for @xmath28 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath10 is the lattice size in the 1-direction , @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath6 is the critical exponent corresponding to the correlation length @xmath45 , @xmath13 is the confluent correction exponent , @xmath46 is the energy gap which scales as @xmath47 with @xmath31 being the dynamical critical exponent ( which is @xmath22 for the phase transitions considered here ) , and @xmath48 is the ratio of the lattice size in the 1- and 2-direction .",
    "further , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 appearing above are smooth functions of the variables @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath48 . in practice",
    "one would carry out the analysis close to the critical point so that @xmath51 in eq .  ( [ fss ] )",
    "can be approximated by a constant .",
    "specifically , the following ansatz @xmath54 where @xmath55 is some constant , is frequently used when applying the finite - size scaling technique .",
    "while eq .",

    "additionally , the box size used in the simulations ranges from @xmath58 to @xmath59 ( strictly speaking , @xmath60 for the staggered - dimer model on the honeycomb lattice . here",
    "@xmath61 is the number of spins used in the simulations ) .",
    "notice to eliminate the temperature dependence in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) , one naturally would use large enough inverse temperature @xmath7 in the simulations so that all the considered observables take their zero - temperature values . on the other hand , since eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) is valid for sufficiently low temperature , one can optimize the ratio of @xmath7 and @xmath10 in order to reach a lattice size as large as possible . as a result , we use @xmath62 for each @xmath10 in our simulations so that the temperature dependence in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) drops out .",
    "we have generated some data using lower temperature and these new data points lead to consistent results with those determined by employing the data obtained with @xmath62 .",
    "first of all , let us focus on our results for the staggered - dimer spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]      figure 2 shows the monte carlo data of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath28 with @xmath65 as functions of @xmath33 for the staggered - dimer spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the figure clearly indicates that the phase transition is most likely second order since for all the observables @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath28 , the curves of different @xmath10 tend to intersect near a particular point in the parameter space @xmath33 .",
    "a surprising observation from figure 2 is that , while @xmath11 receives a sizable correction to its scaling ( which has already been shown in @xcite ) , the observable @xmath8 shows a good scaling behavior . specifically , the correction to scaling for @xmath8 is negligible for @xmath66 .",
    "these findings are similar to the scenario regarding the correction to scaling for the same observables , namely @xmath11 and @xmath8 , of the staggered - dimer model on the square lattice @xcite . indeed , from @xmath8 with @xmath66 , we are able to reach a value for @xmath6 compatible with the expected @xmath14 using the leading finite - size scaling ansatz in eq .",

    ", one has to use data with fairly large @xmath10 as indicated in @xcite .",
    "indeed a similar conclusion is reached here .",
    "interestingly , with the observable @xmath11 , while we either arrive at values of @xmath6 statistically different from @xmath4 or can not reach good results when @xmath55 and @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) are included as fitting parameters , compatible results of @xmath6 with @xmath14 can be obtained from the fits with the assumption that @xmath71 is used as a criterion for the fits .",

    "notice @xmath74 is smaller than the expected @xmath16 in the @xmath0 universality class .",
    "one might conclude that , our results are consistent with the scenario outlined in @xcite that the correction to scaling for this model is enhanced due to a cubic irrelevant term , and this term has impact on the numerical value of @xmath13 . finally , from @xmath28 with @xmath75 , a fit using taylor expansion to second order in @xmath52 as well as letting @xmath67 in eq .",

    "in this study , we investigate the phase transitions induced by dimerization for the herringbone- and ladder - dimer spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice , as well as the staggered - dimer model on the honeycomb lattice .",

    "( [ approx ] ) ) , we are able to obtain a value for @xmath6 consistent with the expected @xmath14 in the @xmath0 universality class . to understand this observation for the staggered - dimer model on both the square and honeycomb lattices from field theory aspect , is an interesting and important topic to explore . in particular , whether the cubic term introduced in @xcite is responsible for this unexpected result should be investigated .",
    "further , while it is argued in @xcite that the herringbone - dimer model belongs to the category of models receiving a large correction , and our investigation supports this scenario , we find that the cubic term most likely has little influence on the confluent exponent @xmath13",

    ", the consistence of the @xmath6 , obtained from the fits using a fixed @xmath81 , with @xmath14 as shown in tables 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 , is unlikely a coincidence considering the fact that the conclusion is valid for both the observables spin stiffness and second binder ratio of both the herringbone- and ladder - dimer models .",
    "in addition , the finite - size scaling analysis performed for the determination of @xmath12 suggests that , our data points for all the 2-d dimerized models with spatial anisotropy considered here are compatible with the established results of @xmath5 and @xmath16 in the @xmath0 universality class as well .",
    "finally , the consistence of the @xmath12 , determined from the fits using a fixed @xmath83 , with @xmath5 implies that the observed enhanced correction to both the staggered- and herringbone - dimer models is because of the nonuniversal coefficients @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ beta_nu ] ) .",
    "indeed , in tables 6 , 7 , and 8 , the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 determined from the fits associated with the herringbone- and staggered - dimer models are at least several times larger in magnitude than those of the ladder - dimer model ( this conclusion remains valid when considering the data sets generated using lower temperatures ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the slopes of @xmath87 as functions of @xmath88 when approaching the low - temperature regime ( @xmath89 is the uniform susceptibility ) , as shown in the figure 6 of @xcite , imply that the correction for the staggered- and herringbone - dimer models are large when compared to those of the ladder- and bilayer - dimer models .",
    "this can be considered as a analogy to our results for @xmath35 and @xmath90 , and might be used as another evidence for the scenario that the influence on the scaling due to the cubic term is the amplification of the nonuniversal prefactors appeared in the scaling forms . whether there is a subtlety behind the results for @xmath91 and @xmath90 shown here and the uniform susceptibilities presented in @xcite , or it is just a coincidence should be investigated analytically .",
    "indeed , we have shown that the values of @xmath13 for the herringbone- and staggered - dimer model agree reasonably well with @xmath16 , by studying the scaling behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath82 at the corresponding critical points .",
    "the rapid saturation of the observable @xmath28 to a constant is crucial in leading to a precise determination of @xmath13 for the herringbone - dimer model .",
    "while the accuracy for @xmath13 presented here has not reached the same level of @xmath92 , we have obtained sufficiently good precision for @xmath13 to draw the above conclusions .",
    "our study of calculating the values of @xmath13 through @xmath28 and @xmath80 , at least for the herringbone - dimer model , at the critical points reinforces our proposed scenario that the enhanced correction to scaling manifests itself as amplification of the nonuniversal prefactors appeared in the scaling forms . while we demonstrate strong evidence that for the herringbone- and staggered - dimer models , the exponents @xmath6 , @xmath12 , as well as @xmath13 agree quantitatively with the established results in the @xmath0 universality class , still , our estimates for the numerical value of @xmath13 are of a few percent uncertainties .",
    "further , the exponent @xmath13 is associated with the correction to scaling , and to accurately determine its value is of highly nontrivial .",
    "hence one can not rule out the scenario that indeed the values of @xmath13 is reduced ( slightly ) due to the cubic term .",
    "hence it is desirable to obtain high statistics data points in order to reach a even higher precision determination of @xmath13 for the models investigated here @xcite . in light of this , as well as",
    "the fact that the values of @xmath13 calculated from @xmath93 of the staggered - dimer model are lower than ( and statistically different from ) the expected @xmath16 , a more detailed numerical study ( to determine the confluent exponent @xmath13 ) and a better theoretical understanding , for the critical theories of the phase transitions investigated here will be very useful .",
