    "<S> the total photo - absorption cross section of @xmath0he is evaluated microscopically using two- ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( nnn ) interactions based upon chiral effective field theory ( @xmath1eft ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is performed using the lorentz integral transform method along with the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model approach . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the present study is the consistency of the nn and nnn interactions and also , through the siegert theorem , of the two- and three - body current operators . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the application of the @xmath1eft framework . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the nnn interaction produces a suppression of the low - energy peak and enhancement of the high - energy tail of the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we compare to calculations obtained using other interactions and to representative experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the rather confused experimental situation in the giant resonance region prevents discrimination among different interaction models .    </S>",
    "<S> ,    25.20.dc , 21.30.-x , 21.60.cs , 27.10.+h    interactions among nucleons are governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the low - energy regime relevant to nuclear structure and reactions , </S>",
    "<S> this theory is non - perturbative , and , therefore , hard to solve . </S>",
    "<S> thus , theory has been forced to resort to models for the interaction , which have limited physical basis . </S>",
    "<S> new theoretical developments , however , allow us to connect qcd with low - energy nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> chiral effective field theory ( @xmath1eft )  @xcite provides a promising bridge to the underlying theory , qcd . </S>",
    "<S> beginning with the pionic or the nucleon - pion system  @xcite one works consistently with systems of increasing number of nucleons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one makes use of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry to systematically expand the strong interaction in terms of a generic small momentum and takes the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry into account by expanding in the pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear interactions are non - perturbative , because diagrams with purely nucleonic intermediate states are enhanced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the chiral perturbation expansion is performed for the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1eft predicts , along with the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction at the leading order , a three - nucleon ( nnn ) interaction at the next - to - next - to - leading order or n@xmath2lo  @xcite , and even a four - nucleon ( nnnn ) interaction at the fourth order ( n@xmath3lo )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the details of qcd dynamics are contained in parameters , low - energy constants ( lecs ) , not fixed by the symmetry , but can be constrained by experiment . at present , high - quality nn potentials have been determined at n@xmath3lo  @xcite . a crucial feature of @xmath1eft is the consistency between the nn , nnn and nnnn parts . as a consequence , at n@xmath2lo and n@xmath3lo , except for two parameters assigned to two nnn diagrams , </S>",
    "<S> the potential is fully constrained by the parameters defining the nn interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the full interaction up to n@xmath2lo was first applied to the analysis of @xmath4 scattering  @xcite and later the n@xmath3lo nn potential was combined with the available nnn at n@xmath2lo to study the @xmath5li structure  @xcite . in a recent work  @xcite the nn potential at n@xmath3lo of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the nnn interaction at n@xmath2lo  @xcite have been applied to the calculation of various properties of @xmath6- and mid-@xmath7-shell nuclei , using the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm )  @xcite , up to now the only approach able to handle the chiral nn+nnn potentials for systems beyond @xmath8 . in that study , </S>",
    "<S> a preferred choice of the two nnn lecs was found and the fundamental importance of the chiral nnn interaction was demonstrated for reproducing the structure of light nuclei . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we apply for the first time the same @xmath1eft interactions to the _ ab inito _ calculation of reaction observables involving the continuum of the four - nucleon system . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we study the @xmath0he total photo - absorption cross section .    experimental measurements of the @xmath9 particle photo - disintegration suffer from a recurrent history of large discrepancies in the near - threshold region , where the @xmath0he@xmath10h and the @xmath0he@xmath11he break - up channels dominate the total photo - absorption cross section ( we refer the reader to the reviews of available data in refs .  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latest examples date back to the past two years  @xcite . of particular controversy is the height of the cross section at the peak , alternatively found to be either pronounced or suppressed with differences up to a factor of 2 between different experimental data . with the exception of  @xcite , early evaluations of the @xmath0he photo - disintegration  @xcite showed better agreement with the high - peaked experiments , and , ultimately , with those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inability of these calculations to reproduce a suppressed cross section at low energy was often imputed to the semi - realistic nature of the hamiltonian and , in particular , to the absence of the nnn force . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of nnn interactions leads , indeed , to a reduction of the peak height , as it was recently shown in a calculation of the photo - absorption cross section with the argonne v18 ( av18 ) nn potential augmented by the urbana ix ( uix ) nnn force  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a damping of the peak was also found using the correlated av18 potential constructed within the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom )  @xcite . in both cases , however , the suppression is not sufficient to reach the low - lying data , and in particular those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter calculations represent a substantial step forward in the study of the @xmath0he photo - disintegration . however , they still present a residual degree of arbitrariness in the choice of the nnn force to complement av18 in the first case , or in the choice of the unitary transformation leading to the non - local phase - equivalent interaction in the second case . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the illinois potential models have been found to be more realistic nnn partners of av18 in the reproduction of the structure of light @xmath7-shell nuclei  @xcite . from a fundamental point of view , it is therefore important to calculate the @xmath0he photo - absorption cross section in the framework of @xmath1eft theory , where nn and nnn potentials are derived in a consistent way and their relative strengths is well established by the order in the chiral expansion .    when the wavelength of the incident radiation is much larger than the spatial extension of the system under consideration , the nuclear photo - absorption process can be described in good approximation by the cross section @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the incident photon energy and the inclusive response function @xmath14 is the sum of all the transitions from the ground state @xmath15 to the various allowed final states @xmath16 induced by the dipole operator : @xmath17 in the above equations ground- and final - state energies are denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , whereas @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the isospin third component and center of mass frame coordinate of the _ i_th nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> this form of the transition operator includes the leading effects of the meson - exchange currents through the siegert s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> additional contributions to the cross section ( due to retardation , higher electric multiples , magnetic multiples ) not considered by this approximation are found to be negligible in the @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite nuclei , in particular for @xmath24 mev . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior can be expected from a system of small dimensions like the @xmath0he .    denoting by @xmath25 the full hamiltonian of the system , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the nucleon mass </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath28 is the sum of n@xmath3lo nn and coulomb interactions , and @xmath29 is the n@xmath2lo nnn force , we @xmath30 ) solve the many - body schrdinger equation for the ground state @xmath15 , @xmath31 ) obtain the response  ( [ response ] ) by evaluation  @xcite and subsequent inversion  @xcite of an integral transform with a lorentzian kernel of finite width @xmath3210@xmath3320 mev ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) calculate the photo - absorption cross section in the long wave - length approximation using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma ] ) . following these steps , a fully microscopic result for the @xmath0he photo - absorption cross section can be reached through the use of efficient expansions over localized many - body states . indeed , in the technique summarized by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lit1]-[lit2 ] ) and known as lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method  @xcite , the continuum problem is mapped onto a bound - state - like problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the present calculations are performed in the framework of the _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> ncsm approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method looks for the eigenvectors of @xmath25 in the form of expansions over a complete set of harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis states up to a maximum excitation of @xmath37 above the minimum energy configuration , where @xmath38 is the ho parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence to the exact results with increasing @xmath39 is accelerated by the use of an effective interaction derived , in this case , from the adopted nn and nnn @xmath1eft potentials at the three - body cluster level  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the ncsm approach combined with the lit method was validated by comparing to the results obtained with the effective - interaction hyper - spherical harmonics ( eihh ) technique  @xcite in a recent benchmark calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a complete description of the ncsm approach was presented , e.g. , in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we emphasize some of the aspects involved in a calculation of the effective interaction at the three - body cluster level in presence of a nnn potential . </S>",
    "<S> we use the jacobi coordinate ho basis antisymmentrized according to the method described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ncsm calculation proceeds as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we diagonalize the hamiltonian with and without the nnn interaction in a three - nucleon basis for all relevant three - body channels . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use the three - body solutions from the first step to derive three - body effective interactions with and without the nnn interaction . by subtracting the two effective interactions we isolate the nn and nnn contributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is needed due to a different scaling with particle number of the two- and the three - body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0he effective interaction is then obtained by adding the two contributions with the appropriate scaling factors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that our effective interaction is model - space dependent . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we need both the effective interaction for the @xmath0he ground state ( @xmath40 ) , and the one for the @xmath41 states , entering the lit calculation . indeed , due to the change of parity , the model - space size changes ( @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> with the effective interactions replacing the interactions in the hamiltonian  ( [ hbare ] ) , the four - nucleon calculations proceed as described in the text following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hbare ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we start our discussion presenting the results obtained for the ground state of the @xmath9 particle using two different values of the ho parameter , namely @xmath43 and @xmath44 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this choice for the ho frequencies is driven by our final goal of evaluating the @xmath0he photo - absorption cross section and providing an estimate for its theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the particular case of the @xmath0he nucleus , frequencies in the range @xmath45 mev allow to achieve a good description of both ground state and complex energy continuum , as required in a calculation of response functions with the lit method  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ gsfig ] the @xmath1eft nn and nn+nnn interactions lead to very similar and smooth convergence patterns . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an accurate convergence is reached starting from @xmath52 , as we find independence from both model space and frequency . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath1eft forces are known to present a relatively soft core , the use of effective interactions for both the nn and nnn forces is the essential key to this remarkable result . </S>",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the present results for ground - state energy and point - proton radius with the n@xmath3lo nn interaction are consistent with a previous ncsm evaluation ( @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 fm ) obtained using a two - body effective interaction in a model space up to @xmath52  @xcite and with that obtained by the hyper - spherical harmonic variational calculation of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we have calculated the total photo - absorption cross section of @xmath0he using the potentials of @xmath1eft at the orders presently available , the nn at n@xmath3lo and the nnn at n@xmath2lo . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . in view of the overall good agreement between the @xmath1eft nn+nnn and av18+uix calculations </S>",
    "<S> , the photo - absorption cross section at low energy appears to be more sensitive to change in the @xmath9-particle size , than to the details of the spin - orbit component of the nnn interaction . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , a more substantial role of the nnn force can be expected in the photo - disintegration of @xmath7-shell nuclei , for which differences in the spin - orbit strength have crucial effects on the spectrum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the rather contained width of the theoretical band embracing the @xmath1eft nn+nnn , av18+uix and ucom results within 15 mev from threshold is remarkable compared to the large discrepancies still present among the different experimental data . hence the urgency for further experimental activity to help clarify the situation . </S>"
