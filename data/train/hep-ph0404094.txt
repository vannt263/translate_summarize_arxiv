    "since the discovery of muon in 1937 , the studies of its properties were always very important for the progress of the elementary particle physics .",

    "_  +  , is investigated in the modern experiments .",
    "in particular , the set of data from the pibeta @xmath0 experiment  @xcite at the paul - scherrer institute contains a considerable amount of these decays .",
    "accurate measurements of the process provide interesting information about the structure of weak interactions .    in this paper",
    "we construct an advanced theoretical prediction for the differential distribution of process  ( [ proc ] ) .",
    "our calculations of radiative corrections ( rc ) allow to reduce the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "that makes it possible to perform precision comparisons with the experimental data and potentially look for _ new physics _ or rule out certain extensions of the standard model .    in the limit of small energy loss ( carried away by the neutrinos ) , radiative corrections to the process",
    "were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this limit",
    "the standard decay produces a background to the searches for the neutrinoless decay @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the general kinematics assuming that the energies of the final state electron and photon are above of a certain threshold and the angle between their momenta is not small ( see sect .  [ hcoll ] ) .",
    "level distribution and the notation are introduced in the next section .",
    "then we consider different rc contributions . in conclusions we present some numerical results and estimate the theoretical uncertainty in description of the radiative muon decay .",
    "within the fermi model of four  fermion interaction , the differential width of radiative muon decay was first considered in refs .",
    "accurate formulae including the terms suppressed by the factor @xmath2 were recently presented in ref .",
    "we checked that their results coincide with the relevant contribution , which have appeared in calculations of exact one  loop radiative corrections to the muon decay spectrum  @xcite . at the born level the differential distribution of the electrons and photons of the process  ( [ proc ] ) has the form [ born ] & & = _ 0 , + & & _ 0 = , d = 1 - c , = , where @xmath3 is the fermi coupling constant ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron and muon masses , respectively ; @xmath6 is the muon polarization vector ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron and photon energy fractions in the muon rest reference frame , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; by @xmath11 and @xmath12 we denote the unit vectors in the directions of motion of the electron and photon , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 . functions @xmath16 ,",
