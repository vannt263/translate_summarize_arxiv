    "the most complete kinematical information obtainable for a distant stellar system is the distribution of line - of - sight velocities at every point in the image .",
    "velocity distributions are crucial for understanding the dynamical states of slowly - rotating stellar systems like elliptical galaxies and globular clusters , since velocity dispersions alone place almost no constraints on the form of the potential unless one is willing to make ad hoc assumptions about the shape of the velocity ellipsoid ( @xcite ) .",
    "velocity distributions are also useful when searching for kinematically distinct subcomponents ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity distribution at point @xmath2 in the image of a stellar system , @xmath3 , can be related to the data in different ways depending on the nature of the observations . in a system like a globular cluster , for which the data usually consist of individual stellar velocities ,",
    "the velocity distribution is just the frequency function of stellar velocities defined by those stars with apparent positions near to @xmath2 .",
    "since measured velocities are always in error , the observed and true @xmath0 s are related via a convolution integral . in a distant , unresolved galaxy ,",
    "one typically measures the integrated spectrum of many stars along a line of sight .",
    "the observed spectrum is then a convolution of the velocity distribution of these stars with the broadening function of the spectrograph , and the spectrum of a typical star .    with both sorts of data ,",
    "the goal is to find a function @xmath0 , at some set of points @xmath2 , such that @xmath4  the log likelihood of observing the data @xmath5 given @xmath6  is large . maximizing this quantity over the space of all possible functions",
    "@xmath0 is unlikely to yield useful results , however , since any @xmath0 that maximizes the likelihood ( assuming it exists , which it often will not ) is almost certain to be extremely noisy .",
    "this is obviously true if the data are related to the model via a convolution , since the process of deconvolution will amplify the errors in the data .",
    "but it is equally true if @xmath0 is simply the frequency function of observed velocities , since the most likely distribution corresponding to an observed set of @xmath7 s is just a sum of delta functions at each of the measured velocities .",
    "one is therefore forced to place smoothness constraints on the solution .    but",
    "smoothing always introduces a bias , i.e. a systematic deviation of the solution from the true @xmath0 .",
    "the nature of the bias is obvious when the smoothing is carried out by imposing a rigid functional form on @xmath0 , since the true function will almost certainly be different from this assumed form .",
    "but even nonparametric smoothing generates a bias since it effectively averages the data over some region .",
    "furthermore , because the required degree of smoothing increases with the amplitude of the noise in the data , the error from the bias goes up as the quality of the data falls .",
    "an ideal algorithm for estimating @xmath0 would therefore be one in which the bias introduced by the smoothing was effectively minimized , so that the derived @xmath0 was close to the true function even when the data were so poor that a great deal of smoothing was required .",
    "one way to accomplish this is to make use of prior knowledge about the likely form of @xmath0 .",
    "many studies of stellar and galactic systems have shown that @xmath0 is often close to a gaussian .",
    "this fact suggests that we infer @xmath0 by maximizing a quantity like @xmath8 the `` penalized log likelihood , '' where the penalty functional @xmath9 is large for any @xmath0 that is noisy and zero for any @xmath0 that is gaussian .",
    "a natural choice for such a penalty functional has been suggested by @xcite : @xmath10 ^ 2 dv.\\ ] ] this functional assigns zero penalty to any @xmath11 $ ] , i.e. any gaussian velocity distribution , and a large penalty to any @xmath0 that is rapidly varying .",
    "the limiting estimate as the smoothing parameter @xmath12 tends to infinity is the normal distribution that best corresponds , in a maximum - likelihood sense , to the data .",
    "thus varying @xmath12 takes one from an estimate of @xmath0 that is very noisy but that reproduces the data well , to the `` infinitely smooth '' maximum likelihood gaussian fit to @xmath0 .",
    "when the data are copious and accurate , the degree of smoothing required , i.e. the value of @xmath12 , will be small and the inferred @xmath0 will be close to the true function .",
    "when the data are poor , @xmath12 must be increased to deal with the noise ; however even a very large value of @xmath12 will yield an @xmath0 that is nearly gaussian and that is therefore likely to be close to the true velocity distribution .",
    "regardless of the quality of the data , there will always be a formally optimal choice of @xmath12 that yields a solution that is closest in some sense to the true @xmath0  neither too noisy nor too biased .",
    "here we apply penalized likelihood methods to the recovery of velocity distributions from kinematical data of two sorts : doppler - broadened spectra , and discrete velocities .",
    "there are of course a large number of excellent algorithms already in use for extracting velocity distributions from absorption - line spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "is another approach really needed ?",
    "many of the existing algorithms are essentially nonparametric and hence yield unbiased estimates of @xmath0 when the signal - to - noise ratio of the data is large .",
    "their behavior given data with small s / n is more variable , however , due to the different ways in which they carry out the smoothing .",
    "for instance , in algorithms that represent the unknown @xmath0 via a basis - set expansion , @xmath13 the smoothing is accomplished by truncating the expansion after a finite number of terms .",
    "adding more terms decreases the bias by giving the algorithm more freedom to match the true @xmath0 ; however the level of fluctuations in the solution increases as the bias falls since the high - order terms will always try to reproduce the noise in the data .",
    "the optimal estimate for data of a given quality will therefore contain only a limited number of terms , and if the data are poor , this number will be small ; hence the solution will be biased toward the functional form selected for @xmath14 .",
    "of course one can choose @xmath15 to be the normal distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) but its mean and variance must be specified , and the optimal choices for both parameters will depend in some complex way on the number of terms retained in the expansion and on the level of noise in the data .",
    "worse , one does not have complete freedom in this approach to adjust the smoothing to its optimal level since the basis set is fixed and its terms are discrete .",
    "most of the spectral deconvolution schemes currently in use have continuously - adjustable smoothing and so do not suffer from this latter defect .",
    "however few of these schemes incorporate any prior knowledge about the likely form of @xmath0 and so the solutions they return given noisy data tend to be unphysical , with functional forms that are determined primarily by the mechanics of the smoothing .",
    "( in fact it is a common practice to fall back on parametric methods when the data are poor . ) for instance , both the wiener - filtered algorithm of rix & white ( 1992 ) and the kernel - based algorithm of kuijken & merrifield ( 1993 ) yield @xmath16 in the limit of infinite smoothing . since real velocity distributions",
    "are unlikely to be well approximated by constant functions , the estimates produced by these schemes can be substantially biased .",
    "the approach advocated here is neither better nor worse than the existing ones when the data are of high quality .",
    "however it has an advantage when the data are poor , since even a large degree of smoothing is likely to bias the solution only slightly .",
    "furthermore the amount of smoothing can be adjusted with infinite precision by varying @xmath12 . in practice",
    "it may be difficult to find the optimal choice of @xmath12 given noisy data , but there are bootstrap techniques for choosing @xmath12 that work well in most cases ; and one can always elect to be guided by physical intuition when deciding how smooth @xmath0 should be .",
    "most important , even a gross overestimate of @xmath12 will yield no worse than a gaussian fit to the velocity distribution , which is perhaps the best that can be hoped for when the signal - to - noise ratio or the number of observed velocities is small .",
    "( much of the uncertainty in @xmath0 s derived from absorption line spectra is due to systematic errors such as incorrect continuum subtraction , template mismatch , limited resolution , etc .",
    "these problems afflict every spectral deconvolution scheme and have been treated at length by other authors .",
    "we have nothing new to say about these systematic effects and will simply ignore them  our focus is on the uncertainty in @xmath0 that is generated by noise in the data rather than by systematic errors . )",
    "below we evaluate the performance of penalized - likelihood algorithms for estimating @xmath0 from spectral data (  2 ) and from discrete velocities (  3 ) .",
    "the former sort of data are routinely obtained for distant galaxies and the latter for globular clusters , clusters of galaxies and systems of emission - line objects around galaxies .",
    "the same formalism works equally well in both cases ; essentially all that needs to be changed is the form of the matrix that relates the observable quantities to @xmath0 .",
    "we also show how the cross - validation score can be used to estimate the optimal degree of smoothing from the data .",
    "we then (  4 ) apply the formalism to the recovery of the velocity distribution near the center of the globular cluster @xmath1 centauri using a new sample of stellar radial velocities from an imaging spectrophotometer .",
    "the optical spectrum at any point in the image of a galaxy is made up of the sum of the spectra of its component stars along the line of sight , doppler shifted according to their line - of - sight velocities @xmath7 . if the galaxy spectrum is @xmath17 and the spectrum of a single star ",
    "after convolution with the instrumental response  is @xmath18 , then @xmath19 the convolution of @xmath0 with the template .",

    "we first define a discrete grid in velocity space , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "typically @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mean velocity of the system and @xmath30 is the expected velocity dispersion .",
    "the number of grid points @xmath31 should be large enough that the numerical solution to the minimization problem is essentially independent of @xmath31 , yet small enough that the minimization  which requires a computational time that scales as @xmath32  does not take inordinately long .",
    "we mostly used @xmath33 velocity grid points in what follows . a discrete representation of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ penlik ] ) on this grid is @xmath34 ^ 2 +   \\alpha\\delta^{-5 } \\sum_{j=2}^{m-2}\\left [ -\\log n_{j-1}+3\\log",

    "the convolution can then be represented as a matrix multiplication , i.e. @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 one then varies the @xmath31 parameters @xmath40 until a minimum is obtained ; the use of @xmath41 in the penalty functional guarantees that the solution will remain everywhere positive without the need to impose additional positivity constraints .",
    "minimization was carried out using the nag routine e04jaf and required about one minute on a dec alpha 3000/700 machine .",
    "if the true @xmath0 is a gaussian , the optimal estimates will be obtained from this algorithm by choosing @xmath12 to be very large ",
    "the algorithm becomes essentially parametric in this limit , returning the normal distribution that best approximates the data .",

    "figure 1 illustrates the famous `` bias - variance '' tradeoff of solutions to ill - conditioned problems .",

    "the estimate is nearly correct , with fluctuations of only a few percent around the true @xmath0 . when @xmath12 is increased still more , the solution is driven toward a single gaussian with roughly the same mean and dispersion as that of the true @xmath0 .",
    "all of these estimates for @xmath0 reproduce the input spectrum with acceptable accuracy , but @xmath0 itself is correctly recovered only when @xmath12 is chosen appropriately  a characteristic feature of ill - conditioned problems .",

    "but the optimal @xmath12 produces an estimate of @xmath0 that is again quite close to the true function , and the velocity dispersion derived from the estimated @xmath0 remains close to the true dispersion even when @xmath12 is far from its optimal value .",

    "the mise falls off roughly as @xmath84 for both types of data , almost as steep as the @xmath85 dependence of parametric estimators .",
    "of course the mean error is larger , at a given @xmath12 , for the sample with nonzero @xmath47 ; however an increase in sample size from @xmath86 to @xmath87 produces the same decrease in the mise as a reduction in the measurement uncertainties from @xmath88 to @xmath89 km s@xmath44 .",

    "finally , we note that the theoretical expectation of maxwellian velocity distributions in globular clusters has rarely been tested by direct determination of line - of - sight velocity distributions . for this reason alone",
    ", it seems worthwhile to estimate @xmath0 in @xmath1 centauri .",
    "about 20 stars were removed from the original sample because their fabry - perot line profiles showed contamination by h@xmath12 emission .",

    "the inferred @xmath0 for field 5 is more centrally peaked than a gaussian and has what might be described as a tail or bump at large positive velocities .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this curve as resulting from the superposition of two normal distributions with different means and variances , though such an interpretation seems extravagant given the relatively small amplitude of the deviations .",
    "the choice of the optimal @xmath12 for these estimates presented certain difficulties .",
    "when dealing with random samples drawn from the normal distribution , the value of @xmath12 that minimizes the error in an estimate of @xmath0 would clearly be very large , since an infinite @xmath12 always returns a normal distribution . because the velocity distributions in @xmath1 centauri do appear to be quite gaussian",
    ", we might expect the optimal @xmath12 s to be `` nearly infinite '' and hence difficult to estimate from the data alone .",
    "in fact the ucv score ( eq . [ ucv ] ) was found not to have a minimum at any value of @xmath12 in any of these five sub - samples ; instead the function @xmath98 was always found to asymptote to a constant value as @xmath12 was increased .",
    "a similar result was obtained using the `` likelihood cross - validation '' score ( silverman 1986 , p. 53 ) .",
    "these results certainly do not imply that the distribution of velocities in @xmath1 centauri must be exactly gaussian , since cross - validation is not a precise prescription for determining @xmath12 and often fails to give an extremum .",
    "but it appears that these velocity distributions are close enough to gaussian that the cross - validation technique can not find a significant difference between the estimates made with finite and infinite @xmath12 .",
    "the following alternative scheme was adopted for selecting the optimal @xmath12 .",
    "a crude estimate of @xmath68 can be obtained by replacing each of the measured velocities by a kernel function of fixed width .",
    "if @xmath68 is exactly gaussian , and if the kernel is also gaussian , the optimal window width ( i.e. dispersion ) for the kernel may be shown to be @xmath99 ( silverman 1986 , p. 45 ) .",
    "fixed - kernel estimates of @xmath68 in each of the five fields were generated from the data using this optimal @xmath100 , and compared to estimates of @xmath68 using the penalized - likelihood algorithm with various values of @xmath12 .",
    "these comparisons could not be made precise since the fixed - kernel estimates have a larger bias and do not compensate for the velocity measurement errors .",
    "nevertheless it is reasonable to assume that the degree of `` roughness '' in the optimal kernel - based estimates ought to be similar to that in the penalized - likelihood estimates made with the optimal value of @xmath12 .",
    "the plots of @xmath0 in fig .",
