    "the exclusive break - up of the polarized deuteron by the protons at a deuteron beam energy of 2 gev was studied at saclay @xcite .",
    "the experiment was motivated by the idea to explore the important details of the deuteron wave function at the high internal momenta .",
    "as compared with the series of previous @xmath4 experiments @xcite , this experiment was designed to be sensitive to the ratio between the @xmath5- and @xmath6-components of the deuteron wave function brought by polarization observables .",
    "the sensitivity to the s / d ratio is maximum when the impulse approximation ( ia ) is valid . in this approximation one of the deuteron s nucleon",
    "is a spectator and another one interacts with the beam / target proton . as theory predicts , and it is confirmed experimentally , the ia is valid only when the internal momentum of the deuteron does not exceed @xmath7 200 mev / c .",
    "an attempt of straightforward experimental testing of the deuteron wave function above this momentum could be justified only if other mechanisms beyond of the ia are well under the control .",
    "therefore a good knowledge of other interaction mechanisms is of the great importance in the experiments of such kind .",
    "that is why the theory of the correction to the ia has a history as long as the experiments initiated by this approximation .",
    "chew and goldberger @xcite represented the scattering of the elementary particles by complex nuclei as the multiple - scattering series @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of two - body nn interactions .",
    "the @xmath10 corresponds to the single - scattering and contains the ia term , @xmath11 corresponds to the double - scattering and so on .",
    "analogous development follows from the faddeev equations @xcite .",
    "everett @xcite was the first who scrutinized the double - scattering terms .",
    "he used the spin - dependent nn amplitude from the phase shift analysis ( psa ) corrected so as to allow one nucleon to be off - shell and calculated the loop integrals of the double - scattering graphs , taking the nn amplitudes out of the integral at a fixed point .",
    "golovin et al .",
    "@xcite used the similar method with the up - date nn amplitudes .",
    "another approach was developed by wallace @xcite .",
    "he took an advantage of the glauber cancellation by the high - order terms in multiple - scattering series of those pieces of the double - scattering loop integral , which originate from off - shell states @xcite .",
    "this approach obtained an application by punjabi et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the question about the role of the @xmath12-isobar in the ( p,2p)-reactions often arises when discussing the discrepancies between the experiment data and predictions with the only nn rescatterings .",
    "yano @xcite calculated the contribution of the @xmath12-isobar to the deuteron break - up reaction using feynman diagram approach but the corresponding amplitude was added incoherently to the other amplitudes .",
    "the analysis of the copious and precise data on the polarization parameters in exclusive @xmath13 reaction , obtained at saclay @xcite , requires to deal with the interference between the various amplitudes of the multiple scattering . in this paper",
    "we present such a model .",
    "it is based on the approach of everett and includes the spin and isospin variables .",
    "the model takes into account the double - scattering contribution and also the graphs including the process @xmath14nn , the virtual pion being emitted by the beam / target proton . since the @xmath15nn reaction at these energies goes mainly through @xmath12n in the intermediate state , the graphs considered by yano are also added in a coherently to the other contributions .",
    "furthermore , the pion - nucleon scattering in other partial waves ( s , p , d ) is also considered .    when calculating the nucleon - nucleon rescattering contributions to the deuteron break - up amplitude one needs to transform the nn matrices from nucleon - nucleon center of mass frames to the common laboratory frame .",
    "these transformations depend on the spin basis chosen for the one - nucleon states . usually the canonical or helicity basis",
    "are used which are transformed with unitary two by two matrices depending on a nucleon momentum .",
    "they are so called wigner rotations and one needs to make the four different rotations corresponding to the two incoming and two outgoing scattering nucleons . the covariant basis @xcite transforming independently of the particle momentum by the unimodular two by two matrices is free from this deficiency .",
    "an amplitudes in the covariant basis are usually referred to as the m - functions of stapp .",
    "the covariant formalism of the m - functions developed by stapp @xcite is based on the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the standard pauli matrices . with an each kinematical momentum @xmath19 of the reaction two by two matrices @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 are associated .",
    "the products @xmath22 of these matrices are the elements from which the m - functions are built",
    ". the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 associated with the four - velocity of the i - th particle , serve as the metric tensors of the particle when performing the contraction over this index ( traces , successive processes ) .    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the sections 1 - 3 cover the three main mechanisms involved in the deuteron break - up : impulse approximation , nn double - scattering and @xmath12-excitation .",
    "the polarization observables obtained with the covariant deuteron density matrix are described in the the discussion of the calculation results and summary is given in the section 5 .",

    "so having at our disposal the @xmath5-matrix elements @xmath217 where the subscript @xmath218 means that the momenta are considered in the deuteron at rest frame , we have to obtain the m - function in an arbitrary frame . the only way in this case is the straightforward applying of the common recipe prescribed by the eq.([eq : s = invvfmvi ] ) of the appendix . at first we derive the m - function in the deuteron at rest system : @xmath219 the boost matrix @xmath220 of the nucleon from the rest to the four - velocity @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the unit vector along the momentum , is determined by the eq.([eq : boost ] ) . having obtained the m - matrix in the deuteron at rest frame we applied to the eq.([eq : m in d - rest ] ) the boost transformation @xmath223 corresponding to the deuteron moving along the @xmath151-axis with the four - velocity @xmath224 so that the final m - function looked like ( see the eq.([eq : ml = zminvz ] ) ) @xmath225",
    "let us remind at first how like looks the density matrix of a spinor particle in the stapp formalism @xcite : @xmath226 where the @xmath227 are the spinor indices , @xmath228 is the four - velocity and @xmath229 is the four - vector of polarization of the particle , which is orthogonal to @xmath87 : @xmath230 . in the index - less form it looks like @xmath231    the analog of the expression ( [ eq : nucl den matr ] ) for the vector particle is @xmath232 where @xmath233\\;.\\ ] ] the @xmath5 and @xmath234 are the vector and tensor polarizations with the properties @xmath235 in the index - less form eq.([eq : ro in dir prod ] ) could be written as @xmath236 if the quantization axis is directed along the @xmath237-axis then in the c.m .",
    "frame we have @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the statistical weights @xmath241 of the states with the definite projections of the spin on the quantization axis are normalized so that @xmath242 . then @xmath243 .",
    "if the particle moves along the @xmath151-axis with the velocity @xmath244 , then @xmath5 does not change , but @xmath234 becomes @xmath245 we can represent then the @xmath246 as @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the unpolarized density matrix and @xmath249 are the vector and the tensor polarization matrices , respectively . if the ( target ) proton is unpolarized , the initial density matrix of the @xmath250 system is equal to @xmath251 and the vector and tensor analyzing powers are equal to @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the unpolarized cross section .",
    "the polarization of the fast outgoing nucleon in the @xmath237 direction is determined by the equation @xmath254 where the polarized cross section is equal to @xmath255 the last equation follows from the eqs.([eq : r0+ry+ryy],[eq : s0ay],[eq : s0ayy ] ) . introducing the polarization @xmath256 of this nucleon for the unpolarized deuteron and the depolarization parameters @xmath257 as follows @xmath258",
    "we can write polarization @xmath259 for the vector polarized deuteron beam in the following form @xmath260",
    "let us start with the main parameters of the detecting system of the performed experiment . polarized deuteron beam of the accelerator saturne was incident on a 4 cm thick liquid hydrogen target .",
    "fast protons from the reaction ( @xmath35 ) were selected at the scattering angle @xmath261 by the magnetic spectrometer spes-4 in the coincidence with the recoil protons ( @xmath25 ) detected at the angle @xmath262 in the scattering plane and @xmath263 in the vertical plane ) with a mosaic of @xmath264 and @xmath265 scintillation counters .",
    "two multiwire proportional chambers at 1.5 and 3 @xmath266 from the target provided the recoil proton track position .",
    "six central momentum settings for the proton detected in spes-4 ( @xmath267 1.6 , 1.7 , 1.8 , 1.9 , 2.0 , 2.05 gev / c ) were studied .",
    "the polarimeter pomme located behind the final focal plane of spes-4 was used to measure the polarization of the fast protons . at the chosen @xmath268 and for the momentum @xmath35 of the fast proton , two kinematic solutions are possible for the recoil proton energy @xmath269 , which according to our definition are the high energy ( he s ) and the low energy ( les ) solutions .",
    "the neutron spectator momenta in the deuteron rest frame , denoted as @xmath270 , ranged from 30 to 440 mev / c .",
    "thus the calculation procedure should include scanning over the acceptance of the detecting system . by scanning over the allowed phase space of the detectors",
    ", we intended to obtain a realistic calculation result , which can be directly compared to the data .",
    "this scanning procedure inevitably invokes the necessity for a monte - carlo type event generation , because the number of phase unit volumes amounts to a huge number when the unit volume is defined by the resolution of the measurement .",
    "we would like to show now , taking the @xmath267 1.6 gev / c and he s as an example , some kinematic distributions characterizing different mechanisms of the deuteron break - up in this experiment . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tij td0i ] the two - dimensional distributions of the kinetic energies @xmath271 of the @xmath272 pairs of the final nucleons with two momenta transfer , @xmath273 and @xmath274 , are shown .",
    "note that @xmath275 are equal to the squared masses of virtual nucleon in the nucleon pole graphs .",
    "it is seen that of three final nucleons considered as the spectator in these pole graphs , the neutron ( @xmath30 ) provides the maximal masses of the exchanged nucleon .",
    "the pole graph with @xmath25 as the spectator gives the negative squared masses and we have excluded this graph from the calculation . the distributions of @xmath276 characterize the graphs of the ds mechanism .",
    "@xmath277 ranges from 30 to 200 mev and therefore the ds graph 2(31 ) is the typical fsi graph .",
    "two other pairs of the final nucleons and especially two protons @xmath35 and @xmath25 have much higher relative energies .",
    "however applying of the glauber approach when calculating the ds graphs with these pairs being rescattered @xcite is not justified because the momenta transfer @xmath278 and @xmath279 for these graphs are very high .",
    "thus we have applied for calculation of the ds graphs the expression ( [ eq : ds31 ] ) and two others obtained from it by the cyclic permutation of the final nucleons .",
    "we would like now to return to the problem mentioned in the .",
    "it is the choice of the fermi momentum @xmath280 in the eq.([eq : ds31 ] ) . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : com of fm ] presents the polarization observables calculated with the @xmath281 in the ds graph 1(23 ) and with the @xmath282 in the ds graph 3(12 ) ( the sensitivity of the contribution of the fsi to the choice of fermi momentum is weak and we fixed it to be @xmath281 ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the choice of the @xmath282 for the ds graph 1(23 ) and of the @xmath281 for the ds graph 3(12 ) .",
    "the solid line is obtained with the @xmath282 in the both these graphs .",
    "the improvement in the description of the data in the latter case is evident .",
    "it is important that neglecting of these graphs results in the significant worsening of the data description .",
    "the dashed - dotted line presents the only fsi prediction and we see that it does not provide the suppression of the tensor analyzing power at the high @xmath270 observed in the experiment .",
    "so we can summarize that besides the fsi graph the both 1(23 ) and 3(12 ) ds graphs are required for data description and they should be calculated with @xmath282 as the fermi momentum .",
    "it is the very choice of the ds model , which we have applied in further calculations .",
    "the measured tensor analyzing powers @xmath1 and the calculation results with bonn deuteron wave function are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ayy ] and [ fig : leayy ] .",
    "the main feature of the experimental data is the strong deviation from the ia ( dashed line ) for @xmath283 gev / c .",
    "the full theory including the @xmath12-excitation graphs ( full line ) gives the satisfactory explanation of this deviation , the ds graphs ( dashed - dotted line ) playing the decisive role .",
    "one could expect the more noticeable @xmath12-effects taking in mind that the laboratory kinetic energies of the 23-pair of the final nucleons range from 0.7 to 0.9 gev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tij td0i ] ) , which is exactly the region of the @xmath12 dominance in the @xmath15nn amplitude .",
    "yet the momentum transfer @xmath279 from the target proton to the fast proton detected by the spes-4 is very high and the pion form factor ( [ eq : pinn ff ] ) reduces the common contribution of the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta excitation ] ( with , of course , correspondingly interchanged final nucleons ) .",
    "the vector analyzing power @xmath284 results , shown in figs.[fig : ay ] and [ fig : leay ] , exhibit the similar tendency : significant correction to the ia above 0.25 gev / c by the full calculations .",
    "the surprisingly good coincidence , taking in mind the very small statistical errors of the measured values , of full calculations with the experimental points is achieved at the all spes-4 settings for the both high and low energy solutions .    for the polarization of the fast proton",
    "the data are averaged over the spes-4 settings to obtain more statistics .",
    "however the calculations were performed for each setting .",
    "the experimental data and the calculations are presented in the terms of the proton polarization @xmath256 for the unpolarized deuteron and the depolarization parameters @xmath257 ( see the eq.([eq : vec pol d p1y ] ) ) and are shown in figs.[fig : p0]-[fig : lep0 ] and [ fig : dv ] , respectively . for",
    "he s a good description is obtained for the @xmath256 with the full diagram calculations , whereas it is not the case for les . for the @xmath257 ,",
    "the ia is even closer to the data than the full calculations .",
    "however , considering the large error bars for the @xmath257 , one can say that there is not decisive discrimination between the both calculations .",
    "the above results were obtained with the bonn deuteron wave function @xcite .",
    "returning to the initial idea of this experiment to discriminate between the different deuteron wave functions we have tried also widely used paris deuteron wave function @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bopacom ] the results of the calculations for the both wave functions at 1.8 and 2.0 gev / c settings of the spes-4 are shown .",
    "it is seen that the dependence on the deuteron wave function of the full calculations is weak .",
    "to conclude we would like to remind that the main task of this experiment was the investigation of the deuteron structure in the high internal momentum region .",
    "the polarization data were thought to bring the information on the @xmath5- and @xmath6-component of the deuteron wave function , which would be possible only if the ia would dominate in the reaction mechanism .",
    "the underlying idea of this experiment as well as the analogous ones is that the deviations from the ia , corrected by other presumingly small contributing conventional mechanisms , could be interpreted as the revealing of the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , the polarization parameters , measured at first time in this exclusive experiment with a large accuracy and in a large amount , deviate strongly from the ia at the high internal momenta .",
    "however , the estimations of other traditional reaction mechanisms , the nucleon - nucleon double - scattering being the most significant , were tried and have shown a qualitative agreement to the referred experimental data .",
    "this agreement between the data and the theory is thought to imply that the possible new degrees of freedom in the deuteron structure contribute much smaller than the hadronic degrees .",
    "still definite perfection of the model is necessary for the adequate description of the polarized deuteron break - up data .",
    "investigation of the short range deuteron wave function , if it is at all possible in the deuteron break - up experiments with the hadron probes , will be , by our opinion , the further step only after all discrepancies in theoretical description of polarization observables are overcome .",
    "the author thanks s.belostotski , a.boudard , j .- m.laget and v.nikulin for fruitful discussions and cooperation during performing this work .",
    "he is also very grateful to a.boudard for the warm hospitality at service de physique nucleaire , centre detudes de saclay , where the main part of this work was done .",
    "let us consider the process with the @xmath285 and @xmath286 spinor particles in the final and initial channels , respectively .",
    "we will denote the corresponding amplitude with the indices as @xmath287 let @xmath288 be the boosts of i - th spinor particle moving with the velocity @xmath24 .",
    "then the connection between the @xmath5-matrix and m - function looks like @xmath289 the boost matrix @xmath220 from the rest to the 4-velocity @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the unit vector along the momentum , is equal to @xmath290 where @xmath291    with respect to lorentz transformations , represented by the unimodular matrices @xmath151 @xmath292 where @xmath293 are the complex numbers such that @xmath294 , the m - functions behave as the operators in the direct product of spinor spaces @xmath295 the simplicity of the transformation ( [ eq : ml = zminvz ] ) is the main advantage of the m - functions .",
    "it allows to build the m - functions from products @xmath83 of two by two matrices @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are the four - velocities of the scattered spinor particles completed by the four - velocity @xmath87 of the whole system in the arbitrary frame .",
    "the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the standard pauli matrices , have the different position of spinor indices specified in the following way @xmath296    the simplest m - functions are easy to derive using the dirac bispinors in the weyl representation in the m - function form @xmath297 here @xmath136 is the bispinor index , @xmath298 and @xmath299 is the four- velocity of the particle . let us consider for example the @xmath203nn vertex . in the weyl representation",
    "the @xmath300- matrix looks like @xmath301 and the amplitude of the transition between real nucleons with the production of the pion is equal to @xmath302 or in the index - less form @xmath303    the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath86 is the four - velocity of the i - th particle , serve as the metric tensors for the spin index of this particle in stapp formalism when performing the contraction over this index ( traces , successive processes ) .",
    "so , in contrast to the simple expression of the cross section via the @xmath5-matrix elements @xmath304 the same via the m - functions looks like @xmath305 or in the index - less form @xmath306    at last let us give one of the basis of the m - functions for the nn scattering .",
    "it is convenient to use such functions @xmath97 in the development ( [ eq : m func devel ] ) , that the cross section is equal to @xmath307 . from the eq.([eq : m funct norm ] ) follows that for this purpose one should build the basis orthonormalized with respect to the scalar product @xmath308 the eqs.([eq : bi]-[eq : norms mi ] ) present such a basis @xcite @xmath309 where @xmath310 with @xmath311 and @xmath312\\left[1-(v_2,v_0)\\right ]                                                          \\nonumber   \\\\ \\|{\\rm m}_2\\|^2= & 4\\left[1+(v_1,v_v)-2(v_1,v)(v_v , v)\\right ] \\left[1+(v_2,v_0)-2(v_2,v)(v_0,v)\\right ]               \\nonumber   \\\\ \\|{\\rm m}_3\\|^2= & 4\\left[1+(v_1,v_v)\\right]\\left[1+(v_2,v_0)\\right ]                                                          \\nonumber   \\\\",
