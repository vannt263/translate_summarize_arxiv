    "the metal content of the icm has proved to be a powerful tool to constrain the past supernova history of the stellar population of galaxy clusters , being it directly linked to the total number of supernovae exploded in the cluster ( e.g. , renzini et al .",
    "supernovae also provide a heating mechanism of the icm , via galactic winds that they power , and the relevance of this heating is a much debated topic in recent studies of icm evolution ( e.g. , ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ; wu , fabian , & nulsen 2000 ; lloyd - davies , ponman , & cannon 2000 ) .",
    "so , estimates of the mass of metals in the icm ( @xmath0 ) are precious pieces of information , and the more accurate they are , the more constraining they can be in recovering the past supernova activity and from here the past histories of star formation and heating and evolution of the icm . a quantity strictly related to @xmath0 is the _ average abundance _ @xmath1 .",
    "there are two main possibilities to estimate @xmath2 .",
    "one is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are three - dimensional gas density and abundance distributions ( e.g. , derived from deprojection of observed two - dimensional quantities ) .",
    "the other is an average abundance : @xmath6\\ ,                       z_{\\rm icm}({\\bf x})\\ , d^3{\\bf x } \\over   \\displaystyle{\\int}n^2_{\\rm icm}({\\bf x})\\ ,                      \\lambda[t({\\bf x}),z({\\bf x})]\\ , d^3{\\bf x}},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the cooling function .",
    "this @xmath8 is estimated for example as a fit parameter when modeling the observed x - ray spectrum of the whole icm .",
    "there are a few serious problems with estimating @xmath9 using method .",
    "in fact , for many / most clusters we do not know :     the of the icm distribution ;     the under which we are observing the icm distribution .",
    "so , we can not unambiguously the observed quantities to derive 3-d ones such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , it is well known that deprojection is a very demanding process , sensitive also to :     the properties of the ;     the ( e.g. , finoguenov & ponman 1999 ) .",
    "correspondingly , there are clear advantages with method :     the knowledge of the true shape of the icm distribution is not required and the result is the viewing angles ;     it does instrumental effects and amplification of measurement errors .    ",
    "the average @xmath13 is the that we may have for distant clusters or those for which there are not counts enough for a spatially resolved spectroscopy ( many more of these are likely to be observed / discovered soon , thanks to _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ ) .    unfortunately , method has one problem , whose relevance has not been investigated so far .",
    "average abundances @xmath13 derived from observed x - ray spectra are equal to the @xmath9 only in case of a spatially independent metal distribution .",
    "so , only if @xmath14 constant , then @xmath15 .",
    "recently spatial have been derived for the icm of many clusters from @xmath16 and @xmath17 data ( e.g. , finoguenov , david & ponman 2000 ; irwin & bregman 2001 ; de grandi & molendi 2001 ) .",
    "when such gradients are present , in general @xmath18 , in a way dependent on the spatial distribution of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "here we address the following point : how much discrepant are @xmath13 and @xmath9 ?    our approach to find the answer is to `` calibrate '' the @xmath22 ratio using * many * plausible ( spherically symmetric ) profiles for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "the ingredients entering the estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath9 are the following :    \\1 ) the cooling function @xmath24 over ( 0.510 ) kev ; this has been calculated with the thermal x - ray emission code of j. raymond ( that gives the same results as the mekal model within xspec for @xmath25 kev ) .",

    ".    \\3 ) various @xmath19 and @xmath20 profiles ( figs . 2 and 3 ) . in a",
    "first set _ of models we assume the icm to be in ( non self  gravitating ) hydrostatic equilibrium within a chosen cluster ( dark matter ) potential well , both in the isothermal and polytropic case . in a _",
    "second set _ of models we consider a cooling flow description .",
    "in this first set of icm models we explored :    the `` nfw '' cluster potential well ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) , where the density profile of the gravitating matter is of the form @xmath29 .",
    "isothermal _ and _ polytropic _ icm density profiles are given by : @xmath30 , \\quad \\rho_{\\rm icm}^{\\rm pol}(r)=\\rho_0\\times   \\left[1+{\\gamma-1\\over\\gamma}{\\mu m_p\\over kt_0}(\\phi_0-\\phi)\\right]^ { { 1\\over \\gamma -1}}.\\ ] ] in the polytropic cases the temperature profile is obviously given by @xmath31^{\\gamma-1}.\\ ] ]    the power law models , in which the cluster density profile is given by @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",

    "jones & forman 1999 ) .",

    "both density distributions are then truncated at a radius @xmath40 , with @xmath41 a free parameter .",
    "constraints on the parameter values have been derived from observational results and from the relations @xmath42  @xmath43 ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) , @xmath43  @xmath44 ( evrard et al . 1996 ) and @xmath45  @xmath43 ( xue & wu 2000 ) .",
    "we estimated @xmath46 by adopting the following parameter values :    \\1 ) for the abundance profile @xmath47 , i.e. , we considered a sort of `` cuspy '' profile , as observed in some clusters ( e.g. , de grandi & molendi 2001 ; arnaud , this meeting ) , and @xmath48 , a linear dependence on radius",
    ". the results are almost independent of @xmath49 .",
    "\\2 ) the temperatures are @xmath50 and 10 kev in the isothermal case ; these are central temperatures , in the polytropic case .",
    "this assumption encompasses the values observed for rich galaxy clusters ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath51 in the polytropic case .",
    "this includes the @xmath52 value that gives a `` good '' fit of some observed temperature profiles for icm s described by a @xmath35-model ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "\\4 ) for the power law models @xmath53 and 1.5 .",
    "\\5 ) for the @xmath35-models : @xmath54 and 0.8 , @xmath55 and 10 .",
    "the general trend of the values derived for @xmath46 is that :    @xmath56 @xmath46 always increases for centrally steeper abundance profiles ( i.e. , lower @xmath27 values ) and steeper gas density profiles ( i.e. , higher @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath35 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xmath56 @xmath46 is always @xmath59 , and it assumes the values below :    isothermal case polytropic case    \\a .",

    "@xmath35-models : 1.42.1 1.52.2    @xmath60 the typical range of values for @xmath61 is 1.42 , quite insensitive to variations of density and temperature profiles in the chosen ( large ) range .",
