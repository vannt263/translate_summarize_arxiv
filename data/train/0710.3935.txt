    "one dimensional toy models are widely investigated in statistical mechanics@xcite . from one hand ,",
    "the possibility to get analytical results represents the starting point for analyzing more physical models . on the other hand , due to their high simplicity",
    ", they allow a better understanding of the key mechanisms at the basis of important physical effects . it is the case of the topological non - connectivity threshold ( tnt ) , recently introduced and addressed in @xcite and investigated in other related papers @xcite . in these simple toy models , with a well defined classical limit two key features were introduced , anisotropy and long  range coupling . even if acting in different ways , they are both essential to generate a significant disconnection of the hamiltonian phase space leading to what is known in literature as breaking of ergodicity @xcite .",
    "while anisotropy is a common paradigm in the phenomenological models of ferromagnetism ( usually introduced as on - site anisotropy barrier in microscopic models ) @xcite , long range interactions were re - discovered quite recently , due to the development of powerful and efficient techniques@xcite .",
    "indeed , strictly speaking , a well known model for anisotropy including a @xmath0 term in the magnetic energy@xcite ( @xmath1 being the sum of all magnetic moments within a suitable domain ) exactly matches an all - to - all interacting model close to what we consider here below .",
    "the role of anisotropy in finite spin systems has attracted much attention recently , following the experimental verification of ferromagnetic behavior in finite 1d systems with strong anisotropy @xcite , contrary to common expectation that ferromagnetic behavior is proper of macroscopic systems only .",
    "theoretical works @xcite , attempted to explain such ferromagnetic behavior in finite systems using microscopic models with on site anisotropy , inducing an effective energy barrier and thus leading to large magnetic reversal times and to ferromagnetic behavior due to finite measurement time .    in this paper",
    "we take a different approach modeling both anisotropy and long - range with some suitable spin ",
    "spin interaction toy model as in @xcite but , differently from there , and in order to produce results closer to real experiments , we put the system in contact with a thermal bath . despite its simplicity",
    ", it can be easily fitted to more physical models : for instance spin systems with dipole interaction in 3-d , have both long range and anisotropic spin - spin interactions .",
    "there are many different ways to model a thermal environment , especially when thermalization of a long range system is needed . here",
    "we take the simplest route and assume that the environment is able to produce a gibbs distribution for the system energies .",
    "in @xcite we have found , for isolated anisotropic systems with an easy axis of magnetization ( defined as the direction of the magnetization in the ground state energy configuration ) that the constant energy surface is disconnected in two regions with positive and negative magnetization along the easy axis .",
    "this disconnection occurs below a critical energy threshold which has been called topological non - connectivity threshold .",
    "since the phase space is disconnected we have exact ergodicity breaking and no dynamical trajectory can visit the whole constant energy surface , but is , instead , limited to the region in which it started .",
    "moreover , being defined for all finite @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the number of spins , the ergodicity breaking is not related to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the topological non - connectivity threshold is an example of topological singularity , well studied recently @xcite , and its existence has been pointed out in ising models too@xcite .",
    "also , an experimental test of ergodicity breaking has been proposed @xcite .    even if the connection between ergodicity breaking and anisotropy has been shown to be a general one , independent of the range of interaction among the spins , long range interacting systems behave quite differently from short ones in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this consequence has been studied in @xcite where it was found that the disconnected portion of the energy spectrum remains finite in the thermodynamic limit for long - range interacting systems only , while it becomes negligible , in the same limit , for short - range interacting ones .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "ii , we review and extend the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the microcanonical behavior of long range interacting systems . in sec .",
    "iii we present a detailed calculation of the density of states , using large deviation techniques , for a mean field hamiltonian and we compared it for a generic long range interacting system .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "iv we study the magnetic reversal time in the canonical ensemble .",
    "in particular , we show how the magnetic reversal time for the open system can be obtained from that of the isolated one ( a non trivial result ) .",
    "also , a very simple approximation allows to interpret the @xmath3 as a real energy barrier for many body spin systems at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "our paradigmatic anisotropic model , with an adjustable interaction range , which presents ergodicity breaking for any @xmath2 , is described by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 are the spin components , assumed to vary continuously ; @xmath6 label the spin positions on a suitable lattice of spatial dimension @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the inter - spin spatial separation .",
    "each spin satisfies @xmath9 and @xmath10 parametrizes the range of interactions : decreasing range for increasing @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 corresponds to an all - to - all interacting model ( close to phenomenological anisotropic models ) , while @xmath13 refers to a nearest neighbor interacting spin model .",
    "@xmath14 parametrizes the degree of anisotropy and for @xmath15 the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) does not have a single easy axis .    in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) the constant @xmath16 has been added in order to fix the scale of time and to describe the model as ferromagnetic .    needless to say ,",
    "this is not the most general spin hamiltonian giving rise to a tnt , even if it can be considered the simplest non integrable hamiltonian with a suitable energy threshold above which the phase space is divided .",
    "the minimum energy configuration , with energy @xmath17 , is attained when all spins are aligned along the @xmath18axis@xcite which defines implicitly the easy axis of magnetization .",
    "the phase space for @xmath19 contains only two spin configurations , parallel or anti - parallel to the @xmath18axis .",
    "therefore , the phase space at the minimal energy is disconnected , due to the uniaxial anisotropy and it consists of two points only .",
    "we may ask now when and whether at a higher energy the constant energy surface is connected . to this purpose ,",
    "let us define the tnt energy @xmath3 as the minimum energy compatible with the constraint of zero magnetization along the easy axis of magnetization ( hereafter we call @xmath20 the magnetization along the easy axis ) @xmath21    \\right .. \\ ] ] it is clear that if @xmath22 the phase space will be disconnected for all energies @xmath23 .",
    "we call this situation topological non - connection , and , as will become clear in a moment , its physical ( dynamical as well as statistical ) consequences are rather interesting . indeed , since below the tnt the phase space is disconnected",
    ", no energy conserving dynamics can bring the system from a configuration with @xmath24 to a configuration with @xmath25 , thus indicating an ergodicity breaking ( impossibility to visit the whole energy surface ) .",
    "a useful quantity measuring how large the disconnected energy region is , compared to the total energy range , can be introduced@xcite : @xmath26 in @xcite it has also been shown that the disconnection ratio @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath7 is the dimension of the embedding lattice . since",
    "this point has not been remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us stress here that the existence of a phase transition for @xmath30 can be inferred from the finiteness of @xmath27 in the thermodynamic limit . indeed , for long range systems , in order to define the thermodynamic limit it is convenient to make the energy extensive .",
    "this can be achieved by multiplying the hamiltonian by @xmath31 .",
    "if we define the energy per particle , @xmath32 , we can write : @xmath33 since below @xmath34 the most probable magnetization is for sure different from zero , then the specific energy at which the most probable magnetization is zero will be greater than the minimum energy in the thermodynamic limit , thus implying a phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , let us also notice that when @xmath35 neither the existence nor the absence of a phase transition can be deduced .",
    "an estimate for the tnt was also given for @xmath30 and large @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , it can be shown that@xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the minimal energy for a system of @xmath39 spins .",
    "for @xmath40 the tnt is given by the minimum of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) under the constraint @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 it is given by the minimum , under the same constraint , of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) . for @xmath43 and finite @xmath2 ,",
    "there is a competition between the two different tnts , therefore , in what follows , we will fix the anisotropy parameter @xmath44 .",
    "needless to say this choice does not affect the generality of our results .",
    "due to the disconnection , below @xmath3 the dynamical time of magnetic reversal is infinite while above and close to the energy threshold ( for chaotic systems ) , it was found to diverge as a power law@xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the entropic barrier between the most likely magnetic states . here , @xmath47 is the probability distribution of the magnetization @xmath20 at fixed energy @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 and @xmath50    the divergence found in @xcite also shows that the phase space becomes connected at @xmath3 , a non trivial result , which can not be deduced from the true existence of @xmath3 .",
    "another important result found in @xcite is that , for all - to - all interacting spins ( @xmath51 ) , the exponent @xmath52 .",
    "this is related with the extensivity of the entropy @xmath53 ( here we set @xmath54 ) and explain the huge metastability of such states even for small systems ( say @xmath55 ) and not necessarily close to the threshold @xmath3 .",
    "we numerically checked that , even for other power - law decreasing potentials in the long - range case @xmath56 ,    * a power law divergence at @xmath3 still occurs as given by eq .",
    "@xmath57([taum ] ) ; * reversal time is still proportional to @xmath58 ( same equation ) ; * the exponent @xmath59 .    in order to do that we computed @xmath60 and @xmath61 for different systems using the wang - landau algorithm @xcite .    in fig .",

    "where @xmath65 has been defined as the energy at which @xmath66 ( that is when the probability distribution of the magnetization has a single peak ) . that way all curves have a common origin .",
    "when the isolated system has a chaotic dynamics we computed the magnetic reversal time from the direct integration of the equations of motion and we compare it with the `` statistical '' time @xmath58 as given by eq .",

    "on the other hand , for @xmath76 we have numerical evidence of a slower dependence on @xmath2 : @xmath77 with @xmath78 . in the same fig .  [ fnew3 ]",
    "we show for sake of comparison the critical case @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and the close - to - critical case @xmath81 where we have found @xmath82 .",
    "even if these results indicate that the simple linear relation @xmath52 is valid for long - range interacting systems only , care should be used to extend the results of the case @xmath83 to large @xmath2 since finite @xmath2 effects are huge in this case .",
    "numerical evidence for @xmath78 has also been found in the short range case ( @xmath84 ) but it will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) for a mean - field approximated hamiltonian can be computed analytically , using large deviations techniques @xcite . in particular we will show that @xmath85 for @xmath48 close to @xmath17 .",
    "we will also give numerical evidence that this law still constitutes an excellent approximation of the full hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) and for generic power law interaction @xmath86 .",
    "let us consider the following mean - field hamiltonian :    @xmath87    which can be considered a mean - field approximation of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , for low energy and @xmath12 .",

    "it is easy to see that for @xmath99 then @xmath100 ( we could as well consider @xmath101 of course , and the result would be the same )",

    "( [ se2 ] ) gives eq .",
    "( [ sebis ] ) for @xmath114 .",
    "we compared this analytical result for the mean - field model with the dos computed numerically for the full hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) and different @xmath11 values in fig .",
    "[ fnew4 ] .",
    "the dos has been calculated using a modified metropolis algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "the idea behind is performing a random walk in phase space within an energy range defined by the system temperature .",
    "the probability @xmath115 of visiting a configuration with energy @xmath48 and temperature @xmath116 , obtained keeping a histogram of the energy values found during a metropolis run , is related to the dos through the boltzman factor @xmath117 .",
    "that provides us a conceptually simple way of determining the dos .",
    "however , due to finite run time , @xmath115 will only contain information near @xmath118 and we must combine the results for runs at different temperatures to obtain the complete dos over the entire energy range .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fnew4 ] the entropy per particle , in the long range case , is almost independent of the range of the interaction , also confirming a result obtained in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the theoretical approach gives a very good approximation of the entropy per particle at low energy .",
    "when the energy is increased , the first term in the full hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) becomes important and some deviations appear ( see for instance the upper right corner in fig .",
    "[ fnew4 ] ) .",
    "needless to say the excellent agreement confirms the power law behavior for the dos , eq .",
    "( [ dospl ] ) , even for energy values sufficiently high . as an example in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fnew4 ] , we can see that the power law expression ( [ dospl ] ) holds up to @xmath3 .",
    "since the tnt has been introduced for isolated systems , question arises if and how it can be defined when the system is in contact with a thermal bath . from the theoretical point of view",
    "we might expect that due to thermal noise the magnetization will be able , soon or later , to change its sign at any temperature @xmath116 , thus suppressing the ergodicity breaking found in isolated systems .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , a critical temperature below which the phase space is topologically disconnected for open finite systems does not exist .",
    "nevertheless we are here interested in more practical questions , for instance : will the energy threshold @xmath3 still determine the magnetic reversal time in presence of temperature as it does in isolated chaotic systems ?",
    "can we predict the dependence of reversal time from temperature or any other system parameters , like the number of particles ?    since the system is in contact with a thermal bath we may consider it as a member of a canonical ensemble .",
    "we may properly define the probability density to have a certain energy value @xmath48 at the temperature @xmath116 : @xmath119 .",
    "considering all members of the ensemble as independent objects we may guess that when the average energy @xmath120 is much less than @xmath3 and the probability density @xmath115 sufficiently peaked around its average value , the majority of the members of the ensemble will not cross the barrier , or at least , the probability of crossing it will be small .",
    "on the other hand for mean energy @xmath120 on the order of @xmath121 each member will be allowed to jump , with a time essentially given by the microcanonical expression eq .",
    "( [ taum ] ) .    let us further assume , following the standard fluctuation theory @xcite , that the magnetic reversal times between states with opposite magnetization are determined by the free energy barrier @xmath122 between states at the most probable magnetization and states with zero magnetization :    @xmath123 } { p_t ( m=0 ) } ,    \\label{grifeq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath124,\\ ] ] is the probability density to have magnetization @xmath20 at the temperature @xmath116 . since @xmath125 $ ] is usually a slow varying function of the temperature , we can write @xmath126 the crucial point now , is to obtain such value using the microcanonical results obtained in the previous section , namely :    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the density of states and @xmath129 is the partition function . since @xmath130 for @xmath131 , the ergodicity breaking acts as a cut - off energy of the integral ( [ p0 t ] ) , so that if the average energy is well below @xmath3 we can expect very large average reversal times .    in order to verify that eq .",
    "( [ p0 t ] ) actually gives the magnetic reversal time , we simulated the dynamics of a spin system in contact with a thermal bath in two different ways , the metropolis algorithm @xcite , and using the stochastic differential equations of the langevin type as suggested in @xcite .    in the metropolis dynamics",
    "the change in the spin direction has been taken at each step completely random on the unit sphere while in the langevin approach a small dissipation has been added .",
    "we checked that the results are independent of such dissipation and that the two approaches give the same results .",
    "obviously , both approaches can give directly the distribution function : @xmath132 , but we prefer here the direct calculation of the density of states and thus the possibility to get @xmath133 for any temperature@xcite , with less numerical effort and greater reliability . as for the reversal time it is quite obvious that an arbitrary multiplicative factor should be considered when the two different approaches are compared ( the unit of time in the metropolis approach is given by a random spin flip ) .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fau3 ] where the average reversal time ( obtained with the metropolis dynamics ) _ vs _ the rescaled temperature @xmath134 has been considered for different @xmath135 and @xmath2 values as indicated in the caption . as one can see the agreement between the integral ( [ p0 t ] ) ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fau3 ] ) and the numerical results ( full circles ) is excellent over 4 order of magnitude .",
    "it is worth of mention that no parameter fitting , other than a multiplicative constant has been used .",
    "it is also remarkable that a small variation in the temperature scale ( about a factor 2 ) generates a huge variation of the average time ( roughly 3 - 4 orders of magnitude ) .",
    "this signals an exponential dependence by the inverse temperature .",
    "nevertheless a simple temperature dependence can not be found in general , even if all curves in fig .",
    "[ fau3 ] can be fitted by the function @xmath136 , with @xmath137 and @xmath138 fitting parameters .",
    "the exponential @xmath139 dependence can be understood in the limit of low temperature .",

    "[ fau5 ] where the integral ( [ p0 t ] ) has been calculated for very low temperature and compared with the true exponential law . as one can see asymptotically they are very close over many order of magnitude .",
    "( [ arr55 ] ) represents the central result of this paper .",

    "if we consider the path followed by the magnetization , as a random path of a brownian particle between two potential wells separated by a potential barrier @xmath159 , according to kramer s theory @xcite the average transition time between the two wells follows the arrhenius law :    @xmath160 therefore it is clear that the disconnected energy region @xmath161 can be thought of as the real potential barrier felt by the magnetization .    in same way",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath162 has the physical meaning of the specific energy barrier .",
    "it is interesting to note that the condition @xmath163 is not too restrictive , at least for long - range systems . indeed , taking into account that for large @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath164 only at criticality ( @xmath165 ) it does not depend on @xmath2 ( and @xmath166 ) , while generally it grows with the number of particles .",
    "this is not at all surprising for a long range systems ; indeed , if we make the energy of the system extensive , ( multiplying the hamiltonian by @xmath31 ) , we have @xmath167 , which is finite for any interaction range .",
    "last , but not least , let us remark that the model given by hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) at criticality ( @xmath168 ) is very interesting .",
    "indeed , for @xmath168 the parameter @xmath27 ( the ratio between the disconnected portion of energy space compared to the full one ) goes to zero in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the difference with the short range case is that it goes to zero logarithmically , instead of a power law : @xmath169 .",
    "this simply means the existence of an effective phase transition for finite systems at criticality .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that signatures of the topological disconnection persist when a long range interacting spin system is put in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "more precisely for temperature sufficiently low we recover the arrhenius law for the magnetization reversal time @xmath170 similar to the reversal time for a brownian particle jumping across a potential barrier @xmath171 .",
    "in other words the magnetization behaves as a stochastic variable and the potential barrier is exactly given by the energy distance between @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "this proves the exponential dependence of the reversal times from the number of particles and _ stable _ ferromagnetism even for small systems with long range interaction and room temperature .",

    "<S> topological phase space disconnection has been recently found to be a general phenomenon in isolated anisotropic spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> it sets a general framework to understand the emergence of ferromagnetism in finite magnetic systems starting from microscopic models without phenomenological on - site barriers . </S>",
    "<S> here we study its relevance for finite systems with long range interacting potential in contact with a thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , even in this case , the induced magnetic reversal time is exponentially large in the number of spins , thus determining _ stable _ ( to any experimental observation time ) ferromagnetic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the explicit temperature dependence of the magnetic reversal time obtained from the microcanonical results , is found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> also , a simple and suggestive expression , indicating the topological energy threshold at which the disconnection occurs , as a real energy barrier for many body systems , is obtained analytically for low temperature . </S>"
