    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) allow us to study the basic energetic processes of young , rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "it is still unclear how the rotational kinetic energy of these objects is converted into a relativistic particle outflow .",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ s unprecedented spatial resolution has revealed that the winds from young , energetic pulsars can lead to highly structured pwne . in some cases",
    "these pwne take the form of an equatorial outflow with polar jets , where the best example of this is the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "these torus plus jet nebulae , of which there are roughly a half - dozen examples , are particularly interesting because a ) they allow us to study the interaction of the pwn with its surrounding environment ( the location of the bright torus is generally believed to mark the inner termination shock of the pulsar wind ) and b ) the well - defined morphology of the pwn can constrain the geometry of the pulsar .",
    "this is crucial for testing models of high - energy pulsations , such as the outer - gap model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the polar - cap model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "+ 3651  revealed that although it is dim , it is young and energetic ( characteristic age @xmath19kyr , @xmath20ergs s@xmath9 , assuming moment of inertia @xmath21 g @xmath6 ) , and a likely counterpart to the _ asca _ x - ray source ax j2021.1 + 3651 and the egret  @xmath0-ray  source gev j2020 + 3658 .",
    "this discovery bolsters the idea that many of the galactic unidentified egret  sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are young energetic pulsars that were not detected in large - scale radio pulsar surveys .",
    "while the spin properties of psr  j2021 + 3651  are very similar to those of the known @xmath0-ray  pulsars vela ( psr  b0833@xmath745 , @xmath22ms , @xmath23ergs s@xmath9 ) and psr  b1706@xmath744 ( @xmath24ms , @xmath25ergs s@xmath9 ) , the 12kpc distance inferred from its dm ( which places it on the far edge of the outer spiral arm ) using the ne2001 electron model of the galaxy @xcite would make it much more @xmath0-ray  efficient than either vela or psr  b1706@xmath744 .",
    "in fact , it would have to be even more @xmath0-ray  efficient than the much - less energetic @xmath0-ray  pulsars geminga and psr  b1055@xmath752 ( assuming the ne2001 dm distance to psr  b1055@xmath752 of 0.72kpc ) .",

    "also overlaid are black contours of the same image smoothed with a @xmath38 gaussian and scaled to bring out what are possibly faint jets along the axis of the nebula .",
    "we estimate 62@xmath3932 counts may be coming from these putative jets .",
    "the nebula appears symmetric about the minor axis , but the point source is clearly offset from the major axis of the nebula .",
    "the overall morphology is suggestive of the torus plus weak jet morphologies of the crab and ( likely ) vela nebulae @xcite .",
    "we discuss the geometry of the pwn further in  4.4 .",
    "the spectra of the pwn and point source can be measured individually using _",
    "chandra s _ excellent spatial resolution .",
    "we fit the spectrum of the nebula and point source using ciao s _ sherpa _ environment ( version 3.0.1 ) and xspec ( version 11.2.0 ) . to isolate the nebula , we used a circular annulus centered on the point source and extending from a radius of 1.6@xmath7100 pixels ( @xmath40 per pixel ) and a circular region from an apparently flux - free area of the s3 chip to estimate the background .",
    "we find that the nebula has a hard spectrum ( see figure  [ specfig ] ) that is well fit ( reduced @xmath41 for 27 degrees of freedom ) by an absorbed power - law model with hydrogen column density n@xmath42  @xmath6 , photon index @xmath4 , and a 0.3@xmath710kev absorbed flux of @xmath43 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 ( 90% confidence intervals ) .",
    "the best - fit black - body model gives reduced @xmath44 for 27 degrees of freedom , a comparatively poor fit to the data .    to isolate the point source , we used a circular extraction region of radius 1.6 pixels , and a surrounding annulus of width 1.5 pixels to subtract the nebular background . because the energy dependent psf extends significantly past 1.6 pixels at this location , we corrected for this by using  mkpsf \" to generate model psfs at several energies between 0.5@xmath76kev from which we estimated the source minus background enclosed energy fraction .",
    "we then fit a linear function to these points which we used to correct the effective area model used in the spectral fit .",
    "based on the observed count rate , we estimate a negligible pile - up fraction of @xmath10.6% using heasarc s webpimms tool .",
    "we find that there is very little emission from the point source above 3kev .",
    "its spectrum is adequately fit ( reduced @xmath45 for 9 degrees of freedom ) by an absorbed black - body model , where we have fixed n@xmath46 to the value obtained by fitting the pwn s spectrum .",
    "the best - fit black - body model and 90% confidence region is @xmath47 @xmath48kev with an absorbed flux of @xmath49 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 ( 0.3@xmath710.0kev ) .",
    "since @xmath47 and n@xmath46 are highly covariant , we also made a joint fit of an absorbed black body for the pulsar and an absorbed power law for the nebula , tying the n@xmath46 of both models together .",
    "this gave values and errors that were essentially the same as those from the individual fits .",
    "since we expect non - thermal emission from the magnetosphere of the pulsar , we also fit a black - body plus power - law model to the point source , fixing the photon index at a typical value of 1.5 .",
    "this did not improved the fit ( reduced @xmath50 for 7 degrees of freedom ) , but the temperature and flux of the black - body component were left relatively unchanged .",
    "this suggests a maximum non - thermal absorbed flux of @xmath51 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 ( 0.3@xmath710.0kev ) .",
    "the total flux measured here is a factor of four smaller than seen by _ asca _ @xcite .",
    "we note that the _ asca _ extraction region has a radius of @xmath14@xmath52 , and thus includes areas well outside the @xmath53-wide field of view of the quarter array used here . a highly smoothed image of the _ chandra _ data suggests there may be additional diffuse emission that could extend well beyond the chip .",
    "furthermore , examination of the _ asca _ image suggests there may be additional point sources or structures within the _ asca _ extraction region that are not within the _ chandra _ field of view .",
    "however , despite the flux discrepancy , the derived n@xmath46 , nebular photon index and point source @xmath47 are consistent with the _ asca _ measurements of the source .      to search for x - ray pulsations from psr  j2021 + 3651 , we also obtained _ chandra _ acis - s data in continuous - clocking mode , which provides an effective time resolution of 2.85ms by sacrificing one dimension of spatial resolution .",
    "the roll angle of the telescope placed the 1 dimensional image at an angle of @xmath162@xmath54 ( n - e ) .",
    "the events were filtered for good time intervals and periods of high background , leaving 20.8ks of integration time .",
    "we corrected the read - out times to intrumental times of arrival by removing telescope dither , motion of the detector with respect to the telescope , and the average lag between the readout time and the true times of arrival of the photons .",
    "the events were then barycentered using the jpl de405 ephemeris @xcite .",
    "given prior knowledge of the point - source spectrum from our imaging observations , we produced an event list with a 0.5@xmath73kev energy cut and a 3-pixel - radius extraction region .",
    "we also produced event lists for a number of other energy cuts and a range of extraction regions and then dithered the events by adding random deviates in the range 0@xmath72.85ms to remove windowing effects .",
    "the event lists were folded at the predicted spin frequency of 9.64094861hz according to the contemporaneous radio timing ephemeris ( see  3 ) , which revealed a likely periodic signal ( see figure  [ xraypulsefig ] ) .",
    "the signal shows up for a range of extraction region sizes and energy cuts , but has a maximum signal strength for an extraction region of radius 3 pixels with a 0.5@xmath73kev energy cut . performing a variant of the h - test @xcite , using _",
    "unbinned _ events , we find an h - test score of @xmath5511.4 , which corresponds to a chance probability of @xmath11 for a single trial .",
    "this has an equivalent gaussian sigma of 3.7@xmath56 .",
    "searching to a maximum harmonic of 20 , the h - test finds the largest significance when two harmonics are summed .",
    "although this signal is not a certain detection of pulsations from psr  j2021 + 3651 , it is intriguing .",
    "if real , these pulsations indicate a pulsed fraction of @xmath137% , where we define pulse fraction to be the ratio of the number of counts above the 1-@xmath56 upper limit on the lowest bin in the light curve ( see figure  [ xraypulsefig ] ) to the total number of background - subtracted counts ( in this case , most of the background is from the nebula ) . from the point source count - rate of our imaging observations",
    ", we estimate that @xmath1190 of the counts in the light curve are from the pulsar and that the rest are from the nebula and other background .",
    "we discuss the pulse shape in  4.2 .",
    "since the discovery of psr  j2021 + 3651  in 2002 february , we have been making roughly monthly radio timing observations of the pulsar at 20 cm using the arecibo radio telescope and multiple wideband arecibo pulsar processor digital correlator backends ( wapps , for details see dowd , sisk , & hagen 2000 ) . each wapp was configured for 100mhz of bandwidth , with 512 lags and 200@xmath18s samples . whenever possible , we used three wapp backends , typically centered at 1170 , 1420 , and 1520mhz .",
    "psr  j2021 + 3651  is significantly scattered ( see figure  [ profiles.fig ] ) . fitting the profiles with a gaussian convolved with a one - sided exponential ( @xmath57 ) we find a frequency dependence of @xmath58 that is well fit by a power law of index @xmath59 .",
    "this is consistent with a pure komolgorov spectrum ( i.e. @xmath60 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the measured frequency dependence",
    ", we find @xmath14ms at 1ghz ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "pulse profiles from each epoch were cross - correlated with a representative high signal - to - noise template to generate times of arrival ( toas ) . using tempo we fit these toas to a multi - parameter rotational model of the pulsar .",
    "the position of the pulsar was fixed at the _ chandra _ x - ray position .",
    "our timing analysis reveals that a glitch occured between mjds 52616 and 52645 .",
    "we can connect phase across it by fitting an instantaneous jump in frequency and frequency derivative ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , which are comparable to those seen in the largest glitches of the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "there is only marginal evidence for a glitch decay in the data , which is not surprising given that the typical timescale for such a decay is on the order of days to weeks @xcite and is therefore not resolved by our sparse monitoring .",
    "the pre- and post - glitch rotational ephemerides of psr  j2021 + 3651  and the complete set of glitch parameters are presented in table  1 , along with derived quantities .",
    "the post - fit timing residuals show significant systematics when only the frequency and first frequency derivative are fit ( see figure  [ timfig ] ) .",
    "we find that the residuals can be rendered featureless by including a frequency second and third derivative into the fit .",
    "alternately , the residuals can be rendered featureless by allowing tempo to fit for position .",
    "however , the pre- , post - glitch , and _ chandra _ positions are inconsistent , suggesting that timing noise dominates the residuals rather than an incorrect position .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the dm distance of psr  j2021 + 3651  is quite large ( @xmath112 kpc using the ne2001 electron density model of the galaxy , see * ? ? ? * ) and would place psr  j2021 + 3651  on the outer edge of the outer spiral arm of the galaxy .",
    "this large distance leads to a very high inferred @xmath0-ray  efficiency ( @xmath63 in the 100mev@xmath710gev range , assuming 1-sr beaming ) .",
    "@xcite note that the electron density model is seldom off by more than 50% when predicting distances , except when the line of sight intersects a particularly dense scattering screen .",
    "we find a scattering measure sm = @xmath64kpc m@xmath65 towards psr  j2021 + 3651 , where @xmath66ms sm@xmath67 @xcite , that is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by the ne2001 model ( although psr  j2021 + 3651  is in the direction of the cygnus region and pulsars in that direction are often highly scattered ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of a clump of scattering material along the line of sight not accounted for by the ne2001 model .",
    "however , small clumps of material that only change the dm by 10@xmath720pc @xmath16 ( @xmath68% in the case of psr  j2021 + 3651 ) can change the sm by a factor of a hundred . hence , the large sm does not by itself imply a significantly closer distance . in order for the distance to imply a much smaller @xmath0-ray  efficiency ,",
    "a significant source of dispersion ( @xmath1200pc @xmath16 ) unaccounted for by the model is necessary .",
    "such a dm enhancement could come from an ultra - compact hii region or an ob association .",
    "an examination of the midcourse space experiment 8.3@xmath18 m ir data ( available from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ) and preliminary radio imaging with vla data we have obtained ( work in preparation ) show no evidence for an ultra - compact hii region .",
    "the ob association cyg 1,8,9 lies in the direction of psr  j2021 + 3651@xcite , however there is currently no evidence that this is significantly contributing to the amount of ionized gas along the line of sight or that the pulsar was born in this association .",
    "since the dm distance places psr  j2021 + 3651  at the very outer edge of the galaxy one would expect our spectral fit to give an n@xmath46 consistent with the total column density in this direction .",
    "the x - ray absorption found here , n@xmath42",
    "@xmath6 , is lower than the total galactic hi column density in the direction of psr  j2021 + 3651 , @xmath69  @xmath6 , estimated using the ftool _ nh _ ( which uses the hi map of * ? ? ?",
    "this argues for a distance somewhat closer than the predicted dm distance , but not closer by factor of a few .",
    "hence a distance of @xmath18kpc is quite plausible , but a distance of less than 5kpc , as required to make the @xmath0-ray  efficiency similar to that of psr  b1706@xmath744 ( @xmath70 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is hard to justify given current observations of the region .",
    "we adopt a nominal distance of 10kpc to use in scaling quantities ( @xmath71kpc ) that depend on distance .",
    "we find a black - body temperature of @xmath3kev for the point source , similar to that found for the vela pulsar ( @xmath72kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and psr  b1706@xmath744 ( @xmath73kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "accounting for the effects of gravitational redshift , this corresponds to a surface temperature @xmath74kev for the canonical neutron - star radius of 10 km and mass of 1.4m@xmath75 .",
    "the point source has an unabsorbed flux @xmath76 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 in the range 0.3@xmath710.0kev . scaling the luminosity to a distance of 10kpc , @xmath77 erg s@xmath9 ( 0.3@xmath710.0kev ) .",
    "one can calculate the ratio of the black - body emission radius @xmath78 and the distance to the source using the bolometric flux @xmath79 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 and the stefan - boltzman law . correcting for gravitational redshift",
    ", this gives @xmath80 , where @xmath81/10 km .",
    "for any reasonable distance , the simple black - body model suggests that the emission is coming from hot spots on the surface , rather than from the entire surface .",
    "this is not unreasonable , as some high - energy emission models predict hot spots due to back - flowing particles .    using the non - magnetized neutron - star hydrogen and iron atmosphere models of @xcite , which assume a neutron - star radius of 10 km and a mass of 1.4m@xmath75 , changes the temperature significantly .",
    "fixing the n@xmath46 to the value derived from the nebular fit , for a hydrogen atmosphere we get a best - fit value of @xmath82 @xmath83kev ( which is similar to the hydrogen atmosphere fit of the vela pulsar , @xmath84kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a flux of @xmath85 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 ( 0.3@xmath710.0kev )",

    "the implied distance here is @xmath113kpc , which is roughly consistent with the emission coming from the entire surface .",
    "based on the soft spectrum of the point source , one would expect pulsations to be due primarily to thermal emission .",
    "the profile found by folding the x - ray events of our continuous - clocking data with the radio ephemeris shows a somewhat narrow ( duty cycle @xmath10.3 ) peak and interpulse , which is possible for thermal pulsations given the right geometry .",
    "if we are seeing emission from hot spots at both poles then it is possible to get two sinusoidal peaks separated by a plateau of emission @xcite .",
    "in fact , the geometry inferred from the pwn ( see  4.4 ) is consistent with the pulse profile seen here .",
    "as noted in  2.2 , a non - thermal component is also allowed by the spectrum .",
    "the possible pulsations might be a combination of pulsed thermal and magnetospheric emission , but the number of pulsed counts ( @xmath169 ) is too large to consist solely of magnetospheric emission .",
    "all the known @xmath0-ray  pulsars have also been detected as x - ray pulsars with non - thermal emission components to their spectra @xcite .",
    "we note that a lack of x - ray pulsations would not preclude psr  j2021 + 3651  from being a @xmath0-ray  pulsar .",
    "for instance , x - ray pulsations in psr  b1706@xmath744 are relatively difficult to detect even though psr  b1706@xmath744 is a well - established @xmath0-ray  pulsar .",
    "thus , psr  j2021 + 3651  remains an excellent @xmath0-ray  pulsar candidate .",
    "we found that the spectrum of the nebula is well fit by an absorbed power - law model with n@xmath42  @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "the photon index @xmath88 is roughly consistent with what is observed from the pwn of other similar pulsars like vela * ? ? ? * and psr  b1706@xmath744 ( @xmath89 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is somewhat higher .",
    "the relationship of @xcite between the photon index of the nebula and the spin - down energy of the pulsar ( equation 3 of that paper ) gives @xmath90 , which is marginally consistent with the @xmath88 measured here .",
    "the unabsorbed nebular flux of g75.2 + 0.1  is @xmath91 erg @xmath6 s@xmath9 in the 0.3@xmath710.0kev range .",
    "this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity in the same energy range of @xmath92 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "for the same energy range , we calculate an x - ray efficiency ( @xmath93 ) of @xmath94 from the combined point - source and nebular luminosities .",
    "this value fits well with the claimed relationship between the spin - down energy of a pulsar and its nebular x - ray efficiency ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even if the distance is as close as 3kpc",
    ". however , note that this is only for the bright inner nebula .",
    "if there is significantly more flux coming from diffuse emission ( as suggested by the _ asca _ data and in analogy with the vela nebula , see below ) then the efficiency will be higher .",
    "the generally accepted view of young pwne ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) is that they are synchrotron bubbles blown at the center of an expanding supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "high - energy electrons and positrons , along with magnetic field , are continuously injected into the bubble by the pulsar .",
    "given that the characteristic age of psr  j2021 + 3651  is much larger than the typical time scale for a snr entering the sedov phase , it is likely ( although not certain since characteristic ages can be off by an order of magnitude or more ) that the outer edge of the bubble ( at radius @xmath95 ) is expanding subsonically into the shocked supernova ejecta .",
    "the bubble is bounded at the inner edge ( at radius @xmath96 ) by the termination of the ultra - relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "the physical size of g75.2 + 0.1 s inner nebula is @xmath97pc .",
    "as psr  j2021 + 3651 s spin - down energy is within a factor of two of that of the vela pulsar , one might naively expect the sizes and morphologies of their nebulae to be comparable . scaling the @xmath98 radius of g75.2 + 0.1 s inner nebula to that of the vela pulsar s inner nebula , which has a radius of 52@xmath997 @xcite and whose distance is well known ( 290pc , dodson et al .",
    "2003 ) , places g75.2 + 0.1  at a distance of @xmath11.5kpc , which seems unreasonable given the dm .",
    "in fact , g75.2 + 0.1  would have to be a few times larger than the vela nebula to put it at a distance that seems at all reasonable based on its dm .",
    "however , since the vela inner nebula is only the central part of a much larger and more luminous nebula , a better comparision between the sizes of these two objects could be made if the true extent of g75.2 + 0.1  is determined in a deeper observation with a larger field of view .",
    "the bright inner nebula of vela and g75.2 + 0.1  may be directly downstream of the termination shock of the relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "the location of the termination shock depends primarily on the energy output of the pulsar and the pressure in the nebula .",
    "the pressure in the nebula depends upon the total energy input during the pulsar s lifetime and the losses due to adiabatic and synchrotron processes ( possibly complicated by the passage of the snr reverse shock ) .",
    "the total energy input is highly dependent on the initial spin period , which is unknown and could range from @xmath110@xmath7100ms @xcite .",
    "we currently do not know the full extent of g75.2 + 0.1 , which is likely much larger than the inner nebula seen here . while it is true that the pressure in the pwn should be balanced by the pressure in the surrounding snr , we know neither the age ( as the characteristic age is a poor estimate of the true age for young pulsars ) nor the size ( since we have not observed a shell ) of the potential remnant .",
    "therefore , although the vela pulsar is twice as energetic as psr  j2021 + 3651 , it is entirely possible that g75.2 + 0.1  is several times larger than the vela nebula .",
    "the size of the torus places an upper limit on the termination shock radius @xmath96 . in analogy to eqn . 1 in @xcite",

    "* ) we can estimate the post - shock magnetic field to be    @xmath100 g    where @xmath101 is the measured location of the torus , @xmath102 is the ratio of the magnetic energy to the total energy in the post - shock flow and @xmath103 is a geometrical factor allowing for non - spherical outflow .",
    "note that the pwn of psr  b1706@xmath744 ( which has a virtually identical @xmath104 to psr  j2021 + 3651 ) is both much fainter and smaller than g75.2 + 0.1 .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field in psr  b1706@xmath744 s nebula is smaller but the density of synchrotron emitting particles is larger .",
    "psr  b1706@xmath744 is a known tev source @xcite , this suggests psr  j2021 + 3651  may be an excellent target for ground - based cerenkov detectors .",
    "our g75.2 + 0.1  image is rather sparse and poisson - limited , and so a unique model for its morphology can not be defined .",
    "nevertheless , the axisymmetry of g75.2 + 0.1  suggests that the morphology may be best described as that of a torus , with possibly weak jets directed along the axis of symmetry ( see figure  [ pwnfig ] ) . to investigate the question of g75.2 + 0.1 s morphology quantitatively , we spatially fit the pwn using the relativistic torus fitting described in @xcite . since g75.2",
    "+ 0.1  appears to have a double ridge , our fiducial model is similar to that of the vela pulsar pwn : twin tori of radius @xmath101 , symmetrically spaced by distance @xmath105 on either side of the pulsar spin equator .",
    "the torus axis is at position angle @xmath106 ( n - e ) and inclination @xmath107 to the line of sight .",
    "the bulk flow velocity down - stream from the termination shock is @xmath108 and a ` blur ' parameter @xmath109 is applied to account for the unmodeled post - shock synchrotron cooling length .",
    "a uniform background and a detailed point source model computed for the pulsar spectrum and chip position are also included .",
    "the 3-d model is projected to the plane of the sky , a poisson - based figure of merit is minimized to find the best - fit parameters and the statistical errors on these parameters are estimated by refitting many poisson realizations of the best - fit model , each with the same number of counts as seen in the data .",
    "the derived parameters from the fit are summarized in table  [ fit.tab ] .",
    "the errors quoted are statistical 1-@xmath56 values only .",
    "systematic errors due to unmodeled features are difficult to quantify",
    ". one estimate of their magnitude can be made by excluding an elliptical zone about the pulsar , extended along the symmetry axis where an unmodeled polar jet might be present .",
    "re - fitting the model to the surrounding data , we obtain values within 1.5  @xmath56 of the original fit for all parameters , except @xmath108 which now is @xmath110 ; @xcite note that for this parameter the statistical errors tend to be small and dominated by systematic uncertainties for edge - on tori . in this particular case ,",
    "the value of @xmath108 is likely being dominated by the bright clump to the south - west of the pulsar .",
    "we have also fit a single torus ; again the geometrical parameters are quite similar , although a larger blur parameter @xmath111 is required to cover the broader torus .",
    "the fit statistic for the model is of course larger than that of the 2-torus model , by an amount similar to that corresponding to 1-@xmath56 excursions in the individual fit parameters .",
    "unfortunately , this does not alone show that the double torus is a significantly better model ; we can not apply an f - test , since the fit statistic is not @xmath112 .",
    "clearly a deeper image is needed to draw firm conclusions , but we can discuss the geometrical implications of the fit angles .",
    "the large @xmath107 implies that we are viewing the pulsar near the spin equator . in the outer magnetosphere picture of @xcite",
    "this is indeed where we expect to see @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "more particularly , figure 4 of that paper shows that for @xmath113 and magnetic impact angle @xmath114 modest ( to allow detection of the radio emission ) , we expect two @xmath0-ray pulses separated by @xmath1180@xmath115 , with the first lagging the radio peak by @xmath110@xmath115 .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite found apparently significant pulsations folding the @xmath0-ray photons from this source near the extrapolated @xmath116 for two viewing periods ; the light curves show two narrow peaks separated by 0.5 in phase .",
    "it is important to note that for @xmath107 near 90@xmath115 , such a light curve is also naturally expected in the two pole model of @xcite and may be possible in polar - cap models @xcite .",
    "the separation of the two tori suggest bright emission at spin axis angles @xmath117 , as viewed from the pulsar .",
    "if these represent enhanced e@xmath118 flowing radially from near the magnetic poles then we might infer a magnetic inclination @xmath119 .",
    "this would imply an impact parameter @xmath120 .",
    "polarization sweep measurements could test this picture .",
    "the unscattered pulse half - power width @xmath133@xmath115 of psr  j2021 + 3651  is substantially wider than the @xmath121 width expected for a core component , but is similar to the @xmath122 width for an outer cone @xcite .",
    "of all the fit geometrical parameters , the most robust is the fit pa of the symmetry axis @xmath106 .",
    "although difficult to measure , given the large dm and expected substantial faraday rotation , the absolute position angle at the polarization sweep maximum would provide an interesting check of the inference that this represents the pulsar spin axis .",
    "we have used the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ to observe the young and energetic pulsar psr  j2021 + 3651  and have detected a new pwn , g75.2 + 0.1 , as well as an embedded point source near the radio timing position of the pulsar .",
    "the morphology of g75.2 + 0.1  is perhaps best decribed as an equatorial torus , and we have derived geometrical parameters for the orientation of the system by spatially fitting the nebula .",
    "spectral fitting of the nebula shows that it is similar to the nebulae of other energetically - similar pulsars .",
    "spectral fitting of the point source shows that it is well fit by an absorbed black - body model or a black - body plus power - law model .",
    "radio timing observations of psr  j2021 + 3651  have revealed a glitch similar to the largest glitches seen in the vela pulsar .",
    "analysis of countinuous - clocking data from _ chandra _ indicates that there may be weak x - ray pulsations from the source ( pulsed fraction of @xmath137% ) at the period predicted by the radio ephemeris .",
    "psr  j2021 + 3651  remains the most likely counterpart to the high - energy egret  @xmath0-ray  source gev j2020 + 3651 ( which is the 10th brightest @xmath0-ray  source above 1gev ) .",
    "it is an excellent @xmath0-ray  pulsar candidate for the agile and glast missions , although a contemporaneous ephemeris will be essential , given the large amount of timing noise the pulsar exhibits .    deeper observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are needed to clarify the morphology of g75.2 + 0.1  and to confirm the presence of pulsations .",
    "such observations are also able to confirm whether the faint outer jet hinted at here is real . currently , there only about a half dozen pwne with torus plus jet morphologies , with the crab and ( likely ) vela nebulae as the best examples . with a deeper observation , g75.2",
    "+ 0.1  may prove to be the third best example .",
    "further work by our group will also include analysis of radio polarization data we have taken with arecibo .",
    "these data may help bolster the geometrical interpretation described here if the swing of the polarization angle across the pulse is measurable .",
    "proper - motion measurements could check if psr  j2021 + 3651  is moving along the axis of the nebula , which is the case for both vela and the crab .",
    "however , measuring the proper motion of psr  j2021 + 3651  ( which will likely be small since the distance is likely large ) will be very difficult both through radio timing because of timing noise or through vlbi because the radio source is very faint .",
    "we are also analyzing vla observations ( in a , c , and d arrays ) of the source region to look for a radio pwn and/or snr .",
    "this is important for characterizing the surrounding medium , which has an important effect on the morphology of the pwn and its size .",
