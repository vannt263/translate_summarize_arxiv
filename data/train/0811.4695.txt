    "recently , condensed matter many - body systems have been viewed in the light of quantum information .",
    "for example , the entanglement inherent in them has been investigated @xcite .",
    "one can , however , ask a different question : how does information placed on one part of a many - body system _ pass through _ such a system ?",
    "aside its fundamental interest , this question may lead to mechanisms for moving information over small distances .",
    "the idea is to use a finite many - body system such as a spin chain ( a chain of perpetually interacting stationary spins  a one dimensional magnet ) as a data - bus @xcite .",
    "many - body dynamics transports information placed on a spin at one end of the chain to the spin at its other end with a certain efficiency .",
    "this is an  all solid - state \" bus whose spins and interactions , except for those at its very ends , are never controlled .",
    "applications could be in moving information between quantum registers or for moving classical bits in nano - scale spintronics .",
    "this area , reviewed in @xcite , has mainly focussed on perfecting the information transfer ( information transmission ) by clever means ",
    "special couplings @xcite , encoding @xcite , pulsing @xcite , memory @xcite etc .",
    "an interesting question from a condensed matter angle is how the above process of information transmission varies with the  phase \" of the spin chain . by ",
    "phase \" we mean both the form of the spin - spin interactions and the relevant ground state resulting from that interaction . in this context , only one study has been performed , which involves spin-1 chains @xcite .",
    "additionally , gapless phases have been shown to be generically bad for a  slow \" information transmission process that can take place between two spins coupled weakly to a many - body system @xcite . the same slow information transmission process between spins coupled weakly to an anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) chain has also been studied @xcite . however , there is no investigation yet of information transmission as a function of the phases of the simplest , namely the spin-1/2 chain , when all spins are coupled equally strongly so that information transmission is fast . instead",
    ", a majority of the work has simply assumed a fully polarized ( symmetry broken ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) initial state of the spin chain @xcite .",
    "here we study the process of information transfer through all phases of a @xmath0 xxz heisenberg - ising chain which models a range of realistic materials and , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , is the most important paradigm in low - dimensional quantum magnetism . using finite chains ( the case relevant for information transmission ) and exact diagonalization",
    ", we identify the point in the phase diagram which provides the optimal data - bus in absence of any encoding , engineering , control etc .",
    "interestingly , this turns out to be the  isotropic \" afm phase which is the most interesting phase @xcite of the xxz model . here",
    "the ground state has complete su(2 ) symmetry and contains significant  quantum \" correlations or entanglement .",
    "this phase is , perhaps , also the most common , as it appears in the ubiquitous hubbard model at strong repulsion and half filling .",
    "additionally most solid - state spin chains such as the famous kcuf@xmath1 @xcite , engineered atomic - scale spin chains @xcite and doped fullerine sc@xmath2c@xmath3 chains @xcite are naturally afm .",
    "this study is an example of non - equilibrium dynamics in many - body systems , currently a topic of intense activity @xcite .",
    "our dynamics is induced by suddenly coupling a single spin ( the one bearing the information ) with one end of a finite spin chain . for a range of phases ,",
    "certain spin correlation functions behave curiously during this dynamics so that the initial state of the added spin _ hops _ through the chain _ skipping alternate sites_. additionally , information transmission exhibits contrasting behavior in the fm and afm parts of the so - called xy phase and has a sharp jump at the boundary of the xy and fm phases .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we show that entanglement distribution through an arbitrary channel is equivalent to the process of transferring a quantum state through the channel . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce our model , i.e. , @xmath4 hamiltonian , and in section [ sec4 ] we consider the entanglement distribution via whole phase diagram of a @xmath4 chain .",
    "this is followed by an explanation in section [ sec5 ] . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we characterize the effect of the channel . in section [ sec7 ] and section [ sec8 ] , the thermal fluctuations and interactions with a bath",
    "are investigated respectively .",
    "classical communication through this system is the subject of section [ sec9 ] , which is followed by considering the information flow  inside the chain \" in section [ sec10 ] . in section [ sec11 ] , we give some potential physical realizations which might test our results , while we summarize our results in section [ sec12 ] .",
    "in order to transfer information from one place to another we have to transfer a state ( say the state of a spin ) which encodes some information . in particular , when we are thinking about quantum information transmission , to quantify the quality of transmission , we compute the fidelity between the sent and the received state .",
    "since this fidelity is dependent on the initial state it is preferable to take the average value of the fidelity over all possible equi - probable initial states .",
    "this average fidelity makes it possible to compare transmission quality of different channels and different schemes of information transmission . to send quantum information from sender to receiver",
    "one can think about two different strategies . in the first strategy , which is called `` quantum state transferring ''",
    ", the quantum state is sent through the channel directly . because of the interaction between the channel and quantum state they become entangled and state transferring is imperfect in the sense that the fidelity between the received state and the initial state is less than one . on the other hand ,",
    "instead of using state transferring one can use teleportation for sending quantum information .",
    "teleportation is based on a shared entangled pair between sender and receiver which plays the role of the resource @xcite . in this second strategy of sending quantum information ,",
    "the sender generates a maximally entangled pair , keeps one part , and send the other one to the receiver through the channel .",
    "this shares an entangled pair between both sides of the channel and teleportation between sender and receiver can be used for information transmission .",
    "however , this fact that the entanglement of the shared pair is not maximal makes the teleportation imperfect .",
    "the importance of the second strategy is that we just send one part of the singlet state through the channel and it is not necessary to study the effect of the channel on an arbitrary state .",
    "what we show in this section is that the average fidelity in both strategies are the same .",
    "this was already shown in @xcite using a different technique for arbitrary dimensions of the hilbert spaces and here we prove it again , just for qubits , using a much simpler language .",
    "let s start with the state transferring .",
    "in this case quantum state goes through the channel .",
    "an arbitrary quantum channel @xmath5 is completely determined by a set of kraus operators @xmath6 such that the output of the channel is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the input state of the channel , @xmath9 is the output state received by the receiver and @xmath10 stands for  state transferring \" . here",
    "we start from the most general form of a qubit state @xmath11 as the input . after interacting the pure input state @xmath12 with the channel the output state @xmath13 ( given by eq .",
    "( [ kraus ] ) ) is generally a mixed state .",
    "fidelity between the received and the sent state is easily computed as @xmath14 which is dependent on input parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 . to get an input independent quantity we average the fidelity over all possible input states , i.e. the surface of the bloch sphere , with uniform weight . with a straight forward computation we end up with @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "now , we try to use the teleportation strategy for sending quantum information . to achieve this strategy",
    "we prepare a pair of singlet state @xmath19 then we keep one part of the pair in the sender and send the other part through the channel @xmath5 . since the first part in the sender does not interact with the channel the whole effect of the channel",
    "is explained by @xmath20 generally , the output state @xmath21 is not a maximally entangled state so when it is used as the resource of the standard teleportation scheme @xcite it gives an imperfect teleportation in the sense that the final achievable fidelity is less than one .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that teleporting @xmath22 with using noisy resource @xmath21 generates the following state as the output of the teleportation .",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for  teleportation \" , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are pauli matrices ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "similar to the first strategy , fidelity of the received and the sent state is defined as @xmath28 and average fidelity for input states is easily computed over the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "the average fidelity of teleportation scheme is @xmath29 the parameter @xmath30 is called _ singlet fraction _ and as it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ fav_tp ] ) that it completely captures the quality of the transmission .",
    "it is also clear from eq .",
    "( [ fav_tp ] ) that to have an average fidelity above 2/3 , which is accessible to the classical teleportation , singlet fraction should exceed 1/2 . using the form of @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ kraus2 ] ) and expanding the singlet as eq .",
    "( [ singlet ] ) one gets @xmath31 . substituting this value in eq .",
    "( [ fav_tp ] ) shows that @xmath32 .",
    "getting identical average fidelity in both strategies is a very important result in quantum communication which shows the average effect of a channel can be captured just by transferring one part of the singlet state through the channel and computing the singlet fraction .",
    "however , sharing an entangled pair between sender and receiver has an advantage , namely that after a few transmissions the total ( generally noisy ) entanglement can be converted by local actions @xcite to nearly a pure singlet .",
    "this can be used to transmit any state near perfectly using quantum teleportation .",
    "so , because of the importance of the amount of entanglement shared between the the sender and receiver , and its above proven equivalence to the more straightforward transmission of quantum states , we mainly focus on the entanglement distribution through the phase diagram of the @xmath4 hamiltonian .",
    "we consider a spin chain as a channel for information transferring and we study the property of each phase of the chain on the quality of information transmission .",
    "we take one of the most well known models in condensed matter physics , namely @xmath4 spin chain .",
    "the hamiltonian of the open xxz chain of length @xmath33 is @xmath34 with @xmath35 being a coupling constant , @xmath36 being the anisotropy and @xmath37 being pauli matrices for site @xmath38 .",
    "this hamiltonian has a rich phase diagram . for @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "this interaction is the fm heisenberg chain widely discussed in the context of quantum communication @xcite .",
    "more interesting regimes exist for @xmath41 and different values of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is the fm phase with a simple separable biased ground state with all spins aligned to the same direction .",
    "@xmath43 is called @xmath44 phase , which is a gapless phase and consist of two different legs , ferromagnetic half ( @xmath45 ) and anti ferromagnetic part ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xmath47 is called _ neel phase _ , where the spectrum is gapped and we get nonzero staggered magnetization . in the limit",
    "@xmath48 it takes the form of neel states ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "though information transmission can be investigated either classically or quantum mechanically we will primarily examine quantum information transmission and devote one section later to classical information transmission in the same systems .",
    "of course , the most natural setting would be sending the state of a single spin through the chain .",
    "however , because of previous `` equivalency '' discussions in section ( [ sec2 ] ) , we will examine the transmission of one part of a two spin maximally entangled state of the form ( [ singlet ] ) while a spin chain channel ( spins 1 to @xmath33 ) is in its ground state of some hamiltonian @xmath50 . at time @xmath51 , the interaction of the @xmath52th and the @xmath53st spin is suddenly switched on while @xmath54 is kept isolated from the rest .",
    "the ensuing dynamics transports the initial state of the @xmath52th spin through the chain to the @xmath33th spin with some efficiency , so that after a while @xmath54 will be entangled with @xmath33 .",
    "as the singlet has the same representation in any bases , the above entanglement transfer already subsumes within it  state transfer in arbitrary basis \" and is thus very general .",
    "the reader may naturally question how general the above physical setting ( couplings etc . ) of transferring entanglement through a spin chain channel is .",
    "indeed one could have taken weaker or stronger or different couplings at the sending and receiving ends .",
    "however , weaker couplings generally lead to  slow \" transfer schemes which will be susceptible to decoherence .",
    "on the other hand , if we really do have stronger couplings or different couplings available at our disposal , we could just use them for the whole chain for faster and potentially better transfer , rather than using those special couplings only at the ends .",
    "so we think that the most natural question to investigate is to simply place a spin encoding the unknown state to be transmitted at one end of the chain , and couple it with the same coupling as present in the rest of the chain ( which , as we know from the previous section , is equivalent to the type of entanglement transmission considered by us ) . in any case , without putting some restrictions on the coupling model at the ends , there is too much freedom in the problem , and it may not be possible to give a precise answer to the effectiveness of a phase to transfer quantum information . moreover , also note that we are not considering the generation of entanglement from inside the spin chain , which is an altogether different problem @xcite , but merely the _ transmission _ of entanglement through the chain .",
    "note that for our scheme we require the chain initially in a unique ground state @xmath55 and this may have to be selected out by applying an arbitrarily small magnetic field ( for odd @xmath33 afm chain and the fm chain ) .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath52th and the @xmath53st spins ( the interaction turned on at @xmath51 ) of the channel is assumed to be of the same form and strength as the rest of the interactions , namely @xmath56    with the @xmath57 singlet , the total length of the system considered is thus @xmath58 with the initial state being @xmath59 and the total hamiltonian being @xmath60 so that @xmath54 never interacts with the rest . also note that @xmath61 is simply a hamiltonian of a single spin chain @xmath62 of length @xmath63 .",
    "as the aim is entanglement distribution , we are interested at the times that the entanglement between spins @xmath54 and @xmath33 peaks . by turning on the interaction between spin @xmath52 and spin @xmath53 of the channel the initial state evolves to the state @xmath64 and one can compute the density matrix @xmath65 where the meaning of @xmath66 is the trace over whole of the system _ except _",
    "sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( we fix @xmath69 in this paper )",
    ". the general form of a two spin density matrix @xmath70 in @xmath4 systems in the computational ( @xmath71 ) basis are @xcite , @xmath72 where all the elements of the matrix are real and they can be written in terms of one and two point correlations , @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( for all @xmath75 ) is the heisenberg picture of @xmath76 and @xmath77 means expectation value according to the initial state ( [ init0 ] ) .",
    "the concurrence as a measure of entanglement @xcite for this general density matrix ( [ general_form ] ) is @xmath78 which is a function of time dependent correlators and expectation values .",
    "noteworthy , is that for @xmath79 , when the initial state of the channel is _ not _ symmetry broken , then symmetry considerations and the fact that @xmath52 and @xmath54 are initially anti - correlated in a singlet , imply that the entanglement between @xmath54 and @xmath68 can be written as latexmath:[\\[\\label{ent_conc }     e_{0'j}=max ( 0 ,    which is solely written in terms of the two - time correlation functions of the spin chain @xmath62 .",
    "it should be noticed that though two point correlations of the @xmath4 hamiltonian have been studied intensively in the literature and their asymptotic behavior is known , the correlations here are different since they are computed in terms of the initial state ( [ init0 ] ) which is not the ground state of @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , if one ignores ( traces out ) spin @xmath54 , our study can be regarded as an analysis of two time correlation functions during the non - equilibrium dynamics that ensues when the interaction of a spin in a random state with one end of a spin chain is switched on .",
    "singlet fraction of the state @xmath81 , which was shown that is directly related to the average fidelity of state transferring , can be computed also from @xmath81 easily @xmath82     and @xmath39.,width=264,height=188 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have plotted both entanglement and singlet fraction of @xmath81 in terms of time for a particular point in the phase diagram , namely @xmath39 . as it can be seen from figure , singlet fraction always oscillates while the entanglement just peaks at certain times which we call optimal time @xmath83 .",
    "when entanglement peaks , singlet fraction also has a peak which shows that final state is more similar to singlet than other bell states .     for different lengths ( j=1 ) .",
    "inset shows the optimal time @xmath83 that the peak happens during the evolution .",
    "b ) singlet fraction @xmath84 at @xmath83 in whole phase diagram.,width=264,height=188 ]    the time that one can afford to wait for the entanglement between @xmath54 and @xmath33 to attain a peak is restricted by practical considerations such as the decoherence time , required speed of connections in a quantum network etc .",
    "so we restrict ourselves to the first peak of the entanglement in time . to compare the performance of different phases of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_ch ] ) in transferring the entanglement , we have plotted the amount of entanglement in its first peak ( @xmath85 ) in terms of anisotropy @xmath36 for the chains with different lengths in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and the associated singlet fraction at the same time in fig .",
    "one interesting feature is that the entanglement transmitted dips on the xy side of @xmath86 and sharply rises on its fm side which captures the first order phase transition at this point ( that such a change in behavior is seen despite the finite size is interesting ) .",
    "in addition , this transition is also marked by a steep rise in the time required to reach the first peak in entanglement .",
    "this is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , which also shows that the speed at which entanglement is propagated increases monotonically in the @xmath44 regime as one goes from @xmath86 to @xmath53 .",
    "this fact is commensurate with the spin wave velocity increasing with @xmath36 as @xmath87 in this regime @xcite which we will discuss it in more detail later . in the xy phase we can recognize two distinct regimes . in its fm sector ( @xmath45 )",
    "entanglement falls rapidly by decreasing @xmath36 , while in its afm sector ( @xmath46 ) the entanglement is always good and increases by increasing @xmath36 .",
    "after @xmath39 , when the transition from the @xmath44 to the neel phase happens , the entanglement starts falling with increasing @xmath36 , as the ising term @xmath88 dominates which , by itself , does not transfer entanglement .",
    "note also a subtle feature that even outside the @xmath44 regime , for @xmath89 , entanglement falls much slower with @xmath90 than for @xmath42 . in general , afms are thus better , even with similar degrees of anisotropy .",
    "[ fig2]a also shows that the isotropic afm heisenberg interaction ( @xmath39 ) not only is the best for transferring the highest amount of entanglement in the entire phase diagram , but also it has the highest speed in the @xmath44 phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , where singlet fraction @xmath84 has been plotted in the entire of phase diagram , in the @xmath91 phase ( @xmath42 ) singlet fraction is always less than 1/2 which shows despite the fact that entanglement is non - zero , quantum communication has no benefit over classical communication .",
    "same thing will happen in the neel phase when @xmath84 becomes less than 1/2 for quite large @xmath36 s .     for both fm ( @xmath92 ) and afm ( @xmath93 ) in terms of length @xmath94 .",
    "b ) entanglement at the first peak versus the length @xmath94 for both fm ( @xmath92 ) and afm ( @xmath93 ) chains when @xmath39.,width=226,height=188 ]    the effect of the length of the chain on the quality of transmission has been shown in fig .",
    "we only concentrate on the best @xmath39 ( isotropic afm ) point , as it is the best point in the phase diagram , and we compare the results with fm chains which have been predominantly studied so far . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we have plotted the time at which the first peak in entanglement for different lengths .",
    "it is clear that the speed of entanglement transmission through the afm ( @xmath41 ) chain is higher than fm ( @xmath40 ) chain independent of the length . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b the amount of entanglement in the first peak has been compared for both the afm and fm cases , from which it is clear the the entanglement transmitted in the case of afm chain has a distinctively higher value irrespective of length .",
    "note also a visible even - odd effect on the amount of entanglement transmitted ( and hence on two - time correlations ) which will be interesting to observe in finite chains .",
    "we have shown that in absence of any of the sophisticated techniques for perfecting spin chain communications , which come at a price , and may be hard to implement and also if one wanted to transfer information fast ( i.e , refrain from very weak couplings ) , the isotropic afm is the best channel in the entire phase diagram of the xxz chain .",
    "we now estimate the efficiency with which local processing at the opposite ends of the spin chain and classical communication between them ( a process called entanglement distillation @xcite ) can establish a _ nearly perfect singlet _ for an isotropic afm channel .",
    "for instance by using the recurrence algorithm for distillation @xcite in a chain of length 10 , for which entanglement @xmath95 , starting from 9 impure pairs on average leads to a nearly singlet state with entanglement @xmath96 after 7 iterations , and for a chain of length 20 , for which entanglement @xmath97 , we need to start with 17 impure pairs to get a singlet state with entanglement @xmath98 after 9 iterations .",
    "this perfect singlet can then be used for sending quantum states perfectly through teleportation .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in different phases the spin chains represent different types of quantum channels .",
    "while in the fm phase , it is known to be an amplitude damping channel ( transmits @xmath99 and @xmath100 asymmetrically @xcite ) , the @xmath39 point affects a so called depolarizing channel ( also noted in @xcite ) where @xmath101 is the mixture of the singlet state and the identity .",
    "such @xmath101 is particularly suited for distillation protocols @xcite .",
    "when the phase of the system changes , not only the hamiltonian causing the time evolution varies , but also the ground state , and consequently the initial state ( [ init0 ] ) varies , and we have a different behavior for information transmission through the chain . results of the fig .",
    "[ fig2]a shows a dramatic and discontinuous change of entanglement at @xmath86 which is related to a first order phase transition at this point and two completely different class of ground states of the @xmath44 and the ferromagnetic phase . at point @xmath102 entanglement falls continuously when we go from @xmath44 phase to the neel phase .",
    "this continuous change represents a second order phase transition at this point . beside these two phase transition points",
    "there is a sharp drop of entanglement around @xmath103 which is very peculiar since there is no phase transition at this point . also from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a it is clear that the optimal time which one has to wait to get a peak goes up drastically for @xmath104 .",
    "this strange property inside the @xmath44 phase is certainly not because of a phase transition .",
    "the reason of this slow dynamics and bad transmission is hidden behind an intrinsic property of the spin chain namely , the spin wave velocity .",
    "field theoretic techniques have been used to capture the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions in spin chains @xcite . for the general @xmath4 hamiltonian , it fails to get all prefactors and exact solutions , but it is able to get the qualitative behavior of correlations successfully in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "correlation functions in our problem are different from those obtained by field theory in at least two ways .",
    "first of all , we consider very finite chains , since the idea of using spin chains as quantum channels is valuable only for a finite distance .",
    "secondly , all the dynamical correlations which are computed asymptotically are associated with the ground state of the system while in our problem correlations are computed for the initial state ( [ init0 ] ) which is _ not _ the ground state . despite these differences ,",
    "we still can use some well known results of the field theoretic techniques .",
    "for example , the dynamical correlation functions in the @xmath44 phase ( @xmath105 ) in the asymptotic thermodynamical limit have the following form @xcite : @xmath106 where @xmath75 and @xmath107 moreover , @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) is the spin - wave velocity ( this quantifies the propagation velocity of excitations in the chain ) which has the following form @xmath109 unfortunately , the above asymptotic forms of @xmath110 , valid for @xmath111 , are _ singular _ specifically at @xmath112 , which is the regime relevant to optimal quantum communication from @xmath68th to the @xmath38th site ( i.e. , when the information , possibly traveling at a velocity @xmath108 reaches its destination ) .",
    "so one can only use some aspects reliably from the above formulae .",
    "one of this is the velocity @xmath108 of propagation of the correlations ( and hence information ) .",
    "( for infinite chain ) and @xmath83 ( for a chain of length @xmath113 ) versus @xmath36 . ,",
    "width=226,height=188 ]    in fig .",
    "[ spin_wave ] we have plotted @xmath114 ( which is for an infinite chain ) and @xmath83 ( for a chain of length @xmath113 ) in terms of @xmath36 . as fig .",
    "[ spin_wave ] clearly shows , both of these quantities behave in a _ strikingly similar _ way ( the gap between two curves is not important since one can multiply them by some constants ) . as a consequence , for @xmath104 the propagation velocity is very slow , and one has to wait a long time to receive some information at the other side of the chain .",
    "this very slow dynamics also means that we will get a sharp fall in the entanglement as well as all other quantities which propagate through the chain unless we are willing to wait for very very long times .",
    "as far as the question of why the isotropic ( @xmath39 point ) is the best point in the phase diagram in terms of a maximum of entanglement , recall that entanglement is given in terms of some dynamical correlation functions as in eq .",
    "( [ ent_conc ] ) .",
    "remember though , that these correlations are _ not _ evaluated for the ground state , so can not be strictly substituted by the known dynamical correlation functions to get any quantitative information , but perhaps only a qualitative picture , as we discuss .",
    "one can see from eq.([eta ] ) that the @xmath39 point is the best for the propagation of correlations along the @xmath115 direction . at points with @xmath116 the @xmath115 component of correlations",
    "does not propagate as well as the @xmath117 component , and , in fact , near to @xmath86 it is expected not to propagate at all ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "thus the term @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( [ ent_conc ] ) for entanglement , which is positive , contributes more and more as we approach @xmath39 and gives a higher entanglement .",
    "it is true that as we approach the isotropic point from @xmath116 side , the @xmath120 rises ( i.e. , propagation of correlations in the @xmath117 direction deteriorates somewhat ) .",
    "however , it must be that the gain from the better propagation of correlations in the @xmath115 direction more than compensates for the deterioration of the propagation of correlations along the @xmath117 direction .",
    "the reason is that @xmath121 changes from @xmath122 to @xmath53 ( huge gain ) , while @xmath120 only goes from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "as far as the intriguing dip after @xmath103 is concerned , we are not yet in a position to explain it .",
    "it seems that the behavior expected at @xmath123 where both the velocity of correlations and their propagation quality along the @xmath115 direction are worst , starts to happen quite a bit _ before _ the actual point .",
    "as it is clear from fig . [ fig3]b in the case of afm chain , entanglement has a zig - zag behavior when @xmath94 varies while it behaves uniformly for fm chains .",
    "this even - odd effect for afm chains has a fundamental reason . in even chains",
    "when @xmath79 the total magnetization of the ground state is always zero and because of the rotational symmetry in the ground state one can exchange all @xmath124 s and @xmath125 s while the ground state remains unchanged .",
    "in other words , in even chains for @xmath79 we always have @xmath126 this symmetry , which is absent in fm chains and also in each of the doubly degenerate ground states of the odd chains , has a profound effect on the transmission characteristics of the chain . in even chains ,",
    "the effect of the chain is completely recognized by the kraus operators @xmath127 .",
    "where , @xmath128 are positive and their summation is equal to 1 so , one can explain the effect of this channel such that it applies one of the pauli operators ( including identity ) with some probability to the input state .",
    "obviously , these probabilities are dependent on the length @xmath94 , time @xmath129 and anisotropy @xmath36 . so using the above kraus operators we get the following form for the state @xmath101 @xmath130 where , @xmath131 are bell states .",
    "thus it means that @xmath101 is diagonalaized in the bell basis .",

    "surprisingly the best point in the phase diagram is not the case of @xmath39 and it moves down inside the neel phase .",
    "the reason of this interesting phenomena comes from the velocity of dynamics . since the evolution in the neel phase is faster ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) and entanglement peaks earlier , decoherence has less opportunity to interfere and shows its destructive effect .",
    "we now comment on the classical information transmission through spin chains , which may be interesting for spintronics . to quantify the amount of classical information which each channel can transmit concept of the classical capacity has been introduced .",
    "the classical capacity of the channel @xmath5 ( introduced by the kraus operators ( [ kraus ] ) in a very general case ) gives the maximum amount of classical information that can be reliably transmitted per channel use . in calculating the classical capacity",
    "it is necessary to perform a maximization over multiple uses of the channel @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the classical capacity of the channel @xmath5 which can be achieved if the sender is allowed to encode the information on codewords which are entangled only up to @xmath156-parallel channel uses .",

    "the classical capacity is an extremely hard task since it needs a very difficult maximization .",
    "but recently the classical capacity of the depolarizing channel has been computed @xcite and it was shown that this capacity can be achieved by encoding messages as products of pure states belonging to an orthogonal basis , and using measurements which are products of projections onto this same orthogonal basis . so due to the fact that entanglement does not increase the capacity of the depolarizing channel all maximization shrinks to compute the single shot capacity @xmath164 as the real capacity of the channel .    as we discussed in section ( [ sec4 ] ) , for even chains",
    "@xmath4 hamiltonian is a pauli channel . at isotropic point ( @xmath39 ) it is a depolarizing channel , which @xmath164 is the real capacity and entangled inputs do not increase it .",
    "this motivates us to study _ single - shot _ classical capacity of the @xmath4 hamiltonian for _ pure orthogonal _ input states .",
    "however the single - shot capacity which is computed over pure orthogonal input states is not necessarily the real capacity of the channel ( except at the point @xmath39 ) but at least it gives us a lower bound of the classical capacity . to have the form of pauli channel",
    ", we also restrict our study just to the even chains .",
    "we start with the most general form of the orthogonal pure qubit states @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 . for input ensemble",

    "when each of these states goes through the channel we get @xmath172 where in the above equation @xmath128 are dependent on time @xmath129 and anisotropy @xmath36 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath173 and @xmath174 are equal and independent of @xmath16 .",
    "thus the second term in the holevo information ( [ holevo_bound ] ) is @xmath175 , which is independent of @xmath168 and @xmath170 and it is just dependent on @xmath15 .",
    "we can easily maximize the first term in the holevo information ( [ holevo_bound ] ) for all values of @xmath15 by choosing @xmath176 such that @xmath177 so to maximize the holevo information @xmath178 one should just find @xmath179 such that minimize @xmath173 .",

    "important point is that the optimal input ensemble is independent of phase @xmath16 which gives us a lot of degrees of freedom for input states .",

    "makes the total system look like a series of strongly entangled pairs next to each other ( with weaker links between ) and this is shown for the @xmath191 case in step 1 of fig . [ fig_ver_5](a ) .",
    "when the system evolves , the state of the system takes the form of step 2 in fig . [",
    "fig_ver_5](a ) and after a while it goes to the form of step 3 in fig .",

    "so despite a finite ( but small ) overlap between the state shown in fig .",

    "quantitatively , all moments of hamiltonian are conserved @xcite during the evolution : @xmath195 , so energy ( @xmath196 ) and its variance ( @xmath197 ) are constant during the evolution .",
    "it means that only states with energy expectation @xmath198 for which @xmath199 , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig_ver_5](a ) can contribute in evolution , while those as in fig .",
    "[ fig_ver_5](b ) can not play a role .",
    "note also that this curious phenomena , when recast in terms of two - time correlations , states that @xmath200 should be less than @xmath201 only for the even sites @xmath68 . thus is potential physical systems where such dynamical correlations is measurable , the hopping mode of transfer should be testable .",
    "we now mention some systems in which our results can be potentially tested , though there is some way to go for some of these systems , as local addressing of the spin to be suddenly coupled to the chain may be required .",
    "recently there has been extensive interest in finite spin chains such as fabricated afm nano - chains @xcite , and especially even - odd effects in such systems @xcite .",
    "this can be one potential system where recently developed sensitive magnetometers @xcite can perhaps be used for verifying the correlations and hence entanglement .",
    "perhaps an stm tip encoding the spin to be transmitted can be brought close to one end of a finite array .",
    "finite chains of doped fullerines in nanotubes @xcite ( such as afm sc@xmath2c@xmath3 @xcite ) is the other alternative for developing this idea .",
    "spins in such systems have already been measured , and perhaps local electrical gates can give local control to couple in the input qubit @xcite .",
    "optical superlattices with atoms can realize an ensemble of finite spin chains @xcite as well as the switching on their interactions @xcite .",

    "the @xmath57 singlet and the finite chain ground states can be created in the cells of sizes @xmath202 and @xmath33 respectively as ground states ( in fact , the former has already been accomplished @xcite ) .",
    "next , again through global methods , the barriers between the @xmath202 site cells and the @xmath33 site cells to their right have to be lowered ( simultaneously the barrier between the two sites of the cell of length @xmath202 has to be raised ) , so as to form superlattices with cells of size @xmath204 each .",
    "the subsequent dynamics will then exactly be as we have predicted and can potentially be verified through global time of flight correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "one can use ion traps where small spin systems are being realized @xcite , as well as implementing spin chains with trapped electrons @xcite where initializing individual spins and controlling the interaction at one end are both simple .",
    "nmr is another fruitful avenue for testing communication through spin chains @xcite .",
    "we have studied the transmission of both classical and quantum information through the all phases of the @xmath4 hamiltonian .",
    "this quantifies the ability of each phase for information transmission .",
    "we found that in the absence of noise and thermal fluctuation isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian ( @xmath39 ) is the best point of the phase diagram for information transmission , both in terms of its amount , as well as its speed .",
    "the speed of propagation of the information , despite our finite open - ended case , fits strikingly well with the spin wave velocities known from continuum limit field theoretic studies of the xxz spin chain . when decoherence and thermal fluctuations are taken to account , the best point of the phase diagram moves to the neel phase , which due to a faster evolution , is less sensitive to these sources of noise .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the transmission through an even chain is characterized by the pauli channel which has benefits in terms of immediate applicability of entanglement distillation .",
    "we also studied the transmission of classical information through this channel .",
    "optimal states for single - shot classical capacity were identified and we realized that even when system is so noisy , such that quantum information is completely destroyed , some classical information can be transferred .",
    "studying the entanglement propagation through the chain showed that entanglement skips odd numbered sites and manifests as a curious behavior of two time correlation functions during the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "it remains an open problem to explain well the mysterious behavior of the dynamics which entanglement suddenly drops around the point @xmath103 .",
