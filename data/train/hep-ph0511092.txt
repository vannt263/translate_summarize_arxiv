    "the main goal of the ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions programme is to create in terrestrial laboratories a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the existence of this phase , where quarks and gluons are deconfined , i.e. can freely move over several hadronic distances , is a definite prediction of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) . in the search for qgp ,",
    "signals in nucleus - nucleus collisions at different nucleon - nucleon centre of mass ( @xmath2 ) energies have been studied : from few gev at ags to several hundreds of gev recently attained in au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "one of the main results is the surprising success of the statistical - thermal models in reproducing essential features of particle production @xcite .",
    "this model succeeds also in describing particle multiplicities in many kinds of elementary collisions @xcite , suggesting that statistical production is a general property of the hadronization process itself @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) supplemented with the hydrodynamical expansion of the matter , to a large extent , also reproduces transverse momentum spectra of different particle species @xcite .",
    "hence , the shm model proves to be a useful tool for the analysis of soft hadron production and particularly to study strangeness production , whose enhancement has since long been proposed as a signature of qgp formation .",
    "furthermore , anomalies in the energy dependence of strangeness production have been predicted @xcite as a signature of deconfinement and have been indeed observed experimentally @xcite .    in a recent paper of ours  @xcite",
    ", we have studied these topics in detail comparing different versions of the statistical model .",
    "more recently , new experimental results  @xcite of hadronic multiplicities at top sps beam energy - i.e. 158 , corresponding to @xmath3 gev - with light ion collisions ( c - c and si - si ) , as well as in pb - pb collisions at beam energies of 20 and 30 - corresponding to @xmath4 and 7.5 gev respectively - became available .",
    "the pb - pb data has been recently analyzed @xcite within a version of the statistical model including a light - quark non - equilibrium parameter , @xmath5 . in the present work ,",
    "we study the energy and system size dependence of chemical freeze - out by performing a systematic analysis of the available data within a more essential framework of the shm , including only the strangeness under - saturation parameter @xmath6 . with the updated data sample",
    ", we also test a two - component version of the shm , where particle production stems from the superposition of fully chemically equilibrated fireballs and single nucleon - nucleon collisions ; we also briefly address , once again , the issue whether the non - equilibrium factor @xmath5 is allowed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief discussion on the shm is given in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .",
    "3 the experimental data selected for the analysis and the results of the analysis in our main and alternative schemes of the shm are given . in sect .",

    "a general discussion of our results and the observed deviations from the data is given in sect .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the statistical hadronization model has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize its founding concepts and discuss the issue of full - phase - space versus midrapidity analysis .",
    "the main idea of the statistical hadronization model is that hadrons are formed in statistical equilibrium within extended excited regions called _ fireballs _ or _",
    "clusters_. several fireballs or clusters are produced in a single collision as a result of a dynamical process , each having a definite total momentum , charges and volume .    in principle , the overall particle multiplicity should be calculated by adding those relevant to single clusters and folding with the probability distribution of volumes , masses ( being lorentz invariants , they are independent of clusters momenta ) and charges . unfortunately this calculation is not possible within the shm alone , because fluctuations of volumes , charges and masses of clusters , being governed by the previous dynamical process , are not known . however ,",
    "if they happen to be the same as those relevant to the random partitioning of one large cluster - defined as _",
    "equivalent global cluster _",
    "( egc ) - having as volume the sum of all clusters rest frame volumes - the overall particle multiplicities turn out to be simply those the egc @xcite , which has charges equal to the sum of single clusters charges in compliance of conservation laws .",
    "the straightforward consequence of such an assumption is that , in order to calculate full phase space mean multiplicities , one can use a simple single - cluster ( i.e. the egc ) formula .",
    "of course , this is just a phenomenological simplifying assumption and it should _ not _ be expected to be fully true ; deviations from this simple picture should show up as second - order deviations between data and model .",
    "it is very important to emphasize that the egc picture takes advantage of the independence of particle multiplicity ( as well as any other lorentz scalar ) on clusters momenta and , consequently , on any dynamical charge - momentum correlation .",
    "this means that the hypothesis of single egc calculation may hold even if clusters with large baryon number ( and density ) are likely to have large rapidity .    to show this in simplest terms ,",
    "let us consider events with @xmath7 clusters and let @xmath8 the probability of having the @xmath9 cluster with charge @xmath10 at rapidity @xmath11 .",
    "the overall average particle multiplicity of the species @xmath12 reads : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average multiplicity of the species @xmath12 for a particular charge and rapidity configuration .",
    "now , being a lorentz scalar , @xmath15 can only depends on charges , hence in fact @xmath16 .",
    "therefore : @xmath17 where : @xmath18 thus , in order to reduce to the simple egc case , we have to introduce some hypothesis on the form of the _ marginal _ distribution of charges @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ special ] ) and we do not need to deal anymore with the full distribution of charges and rapidities @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) ; charge - rapidity correlations have disappeared .    in a different approach , used in several works ,",
    "the formulas of the statistical model are assumed to apply only to the _ average _ ( with respect to all kinds of fluctuations ) fireball at midrapidity .",
    "the charge probability distribution @xmath21 of a fireball at rapidity @xmath22 is obtained from the general @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) by integrating over all rapidities : @xmath23 thus , in order to perform a statistical model fit , one would need to assume only that charge fluctuations at midrapidity , i.e. @xmath24 , are not too large , which is apparently a less restrictive requirement than that needed to ensure the validity of the egc approach . in order to estimate the parameters of the average central fireball , the idea is then to use particle yields and ratios measured at midrapidity rather than in full phase space .",
    "however , these yields do not single out the production from the central fireball as also nearby clusters contribute to them and , if they have quite different mean charges , one would not get the desired result . moreover , if a single cluster was formed at rest in the centre - of - mass frame , a cut on a midrapidity window ( @xmath25 ) would introduce a bias in the estimation of thermal parameters because rapidity distributions are narrower for more massive particles ( see e.g. discussion in ref .",
    "the general effect would be an increase in the fitted temperature and strangeness under - saturation parameter @xmath26 , what is indeed the case in an analysis at sps using midrapidity densities @xcite .",
    "in fact , narrower rapidity distributions for more massive particles have been measured up to top sps energy ( @xmath27 gev ) . for this approach to yield consistent results",
    ", one would need a distribution of clusters with an approximately uniform charge and energy densities over a sufficiently large rapidity region , i.e. larger than the typical width of single cluster s particle rapidity spectrum . to show this , we start by writing the rapidity spectrum of a particle as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density of clusters at rapidity @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the primordial rapidity spectrum of particles emitted from the cluster with rapidity @xmath30 . changing the integration variable to @xmath32 ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath33 if @xmath34 is approximately constant over a rapidity range ( around @xmath22 ) sufficiently larger than the width of @xmath31 , and so are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then : @xmath37 hence the rapidity density turns out to be proportional to the number of particles emitted from the average cluster at rapidity @xmath22 .",
    "this condition also implies that the measured @xmath38 is approximately constant over the same range .",
    "however , this necessary condition is not met at centre - of - mass energies @xmath2 up to 20@xmath0 gev , as measured rapidity distributions have a width not much larger than those from a single cluster at the kinetic freeze out .",
    "for instance , for pions at top sps energy , the expected dispersion of the central cluster s rapidity distribution at a kinetic freeze - out temperature of @xmath39 mev , is about 0.8 while the dispersion of the actual distribution is @xmath40 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the measured width at @xmath41 at rhic is @xmath42 for pions @xcite and antiparticle / particle ratio is apparently stable over a rapidity window of about 2 units around midrapidity @xcite .",
    "these two observations indicate that extracting the characteristics of the average source at midrapidity by using midrapidity ratios is indeed possible at centre - of - mass energies @xmath43 gev .",
    "then , we conclude that the use of full phase space multiplicities is better suited over the energy range of ags and sps , that we are examining in the present work , whilst midrapidity particle ratios can be used at rhic energies to determine the characteristics of the central source . even though a statistical model fit to full phase space multiplicities at rhic in principle may be attempted , provided that the egc condition applies , the presently available data set is not sufficient to make a reliable assessment .",
    "the experimental data set consists of measurements performed by na49 collaboration in p - p ( all inelastic reactions ) , c - c ( 15.3% most central ) , si - si ( 12.2% most central ) collisions at beam momentum of 158  as well as pb - pb collisions at beam momenta of 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 , 40@xmath0 , 80@xmath0 and 158(corresponding to @xmath44 6.2 , 7.5 , 8.7 , 12.3 and 17.2 gev , respectively ) . the pb - pb data set corresponds to 7% most central events except at top energy , where only 5% thereof was selected .",
    "we also refit measurements in au - au collisions at 11.6of beam momentum ( corresponding to @xmath45 gev ) by using the new hadronic data set input @xcite .",
    "the analysis is performed by searching the minima of the @xmath46 : @xmath47 in which @xmath48 is the full phase space of the @xmath9 hadron species and @xmath49 is the sum in quadrature of statistical and systematic experimental error .",
    "the theoretical multiplicities are calculated by adding the primary multiplicities to the contribution from secondary decays . in order to make a proper comparison with the data ,",
    "the decay chain is stopped so as to match the experimental definition of measured particle . for sps data ,",
    "weakly decaying particles are considered as stable , except @xmath50 and @xmath51 at 20@xmath0 and 30 , whereas for ags au - au collisions , weak decays of hyperons and k@xmath52 are performed .",
    "the final experimental and theoretical multiplicities used in our analysis are shown in tables  [ smallmult ] , [ 203040mult ] and [ 80158rhicmult ] .",
    "we have performed the analysis with two independent programs , hereafter referred to as analyses a and b , to cross check the results and to assess the stability of the fits .",
    "we find only small discrepancies between the different analyses , mainly owing to a different method of treating hidden strangeness , branching ratios and a slightly different particle input .",
    "the effect of uncertainties in masses , widths and branching ratios have been shown to be negligible @xcite and the difference in results between the two analyses arises solely from the different selection of the included hadronic states .",
    "the observed differences in the fit parameters between a and b are of the order of the fit errors and they may be considered as an estimate of the systematic error due to uncertainties in the implementation of the model .",
    "we give two different errors for the fitted parameters and derived quantities in table  [ fit ] , the first being the error coming out from the fitting program ( inferred from the analysis of the @xmath53 level contours ) while the second one is the error rescaled by a factor @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we deem that the latter is a more realistic uncertainty on the parameters because of the `` imperfect '' @xmath56 values ( for further details , see  @xcite ) , and thus the rescaled errors are used in all plots in this paper .",

    "the quality of the fits can be regarded as satisfactory overall , although not really good from a statistical point of view ( except in au - au and c - c collisions ) as @xmath68 s are generally of the order of 2 - 3 .",

    "this volume effectively introduces a repulsive hard - core interaction in the hadron gas equation of state , yet it is an unknown quantity and one has to make some assumptions to develop calculations . if it was the same for all hadrons , there would be no corrections to the intensive parameters , as the ratio between different species would be the same ( this can be seen from eq .",
