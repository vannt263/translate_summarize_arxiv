    "recently , the opposite deformations between proton and neutron densities in c isotopes were theoretically suggested @xcite by the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) : the proton density has an oblate deformation , while the neutron density has a prolate deformation , and the symmetry axis of proton is perpendicular to that of neutron in @xmath4c and @xmath0c . based on this picture , the author also gave a qualitative explanation @xcite for unusually small electric transition strength @xmath5 in @xmath0c , which is derived from life time measurement @xcite . according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "the 2@xmath6 state is a rotational excited state , and the rotational axis is perpendicular to the neutron symmetry axis . in this excitation mechanism ,",
    "the proton transition strength is reduced due to the difference of deformation between the proton and neutron distributions mentioned above , and therefore , the @xmath1 transition is dominated by the neutron excitation .    in order to search for the possible difference of proton and neutron contributions to excitation of the @xmath7 state in @xmath0c",
    ", inelastic scattering experiment of @xmath0c on @xmath2pb target was performed @xcite applying the coulomb - nuclear interference method .",
