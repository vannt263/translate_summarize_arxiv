    "entanglement in quantum mechanics intuitively implies some form of non - locality , and the locality issue is usually discussed in terms of the notion of local realism .",
    "although a precise mathematical definition of local realism appears to be absent , it is customary to use noncontextual and local hidden - variables models as a concrete realization of local realism . in the present paper",
    "we follow this tradition , and we use the hidden - variables model that belongs to the same class of models as in the original paper of bell  @xcite which is noncontextual and local ( i.e. , a noncontextual model applied to only far apart parties ) as classified by mermin@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to propose a very simple test of local realism in addition to the well - known chsh inequality  @xcite .",
    "this criterion is based on the fact that _ non - contextual and local hidden - variables models in @xmath10 , namely , local realism can describe only separable quantum mechanical states_. this criterion is quantified by , @xmath11=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for arbitrary two projection operators @xmath3 and @xmath12 . a decisive test of local realism",
    "is then given by the deviation of @xmath5 from @xmath6 .",
    "we suspect that this fact itself has been known , but , to our knowledge , no systematic use of this fact as a practical test of local realism has been attempted in the past ; to substantiate this statement , we later discuss the early experiment by aspect and his collaborators in 1981  @xcite .",
    "we are going to first derive the above fact directly by an analysis of local hidden - variables models . here",
    "the linearity of the probability measure , which is fundamental to born s probability interpretation of quantum mechanics , is crucial .",
    "then we argue that the same result is inferred from a combination of ( the contraposition of ) gisin s theorem in quantum mechanics  @xcite with the well - known bell s theorem in hidden - variables models ; this implies that the linearity of the probability measure is implicitly assumed in the derivation of bell - chsh inequality@xcite .",
    "we here recall that the basic operational rule of the hidden - variables model is to translate a quantum mechanical statement into the language of the hidden - variables model and then after the manipulations allowed in the hidden - variables model , translate the final result back into a statement of quantum mechanics which may be tested by experiments .",
    "our relation @xmath6 in ( 1.1 ) and the well - known chsh inequality @xmath1  @xcite , both of which are stated in quantum mechanical language , are the consequences of local realism in this sense .",
    "we start with the assumption that the correlation for two projection operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 belonging to systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , is expressed in @xmath0 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 assume the eigenvalues of projectors , namely , @xmath15 or @xmath20 .",
    "this specific hidden - variables representation was mentioned by bell in his original paper  @xcite ; he argued that this representation is included in the more conventional one @xmath21 if one writes @xmath22 and recalls the fact that the @xmath23 dependence of the other factors in ( 2.2 ) is arbitrary .",
    "the converse is also true since one recovers the more conventional representation ( 2.2 ) from ( 2.1 ) by setting @xmath24 the representation ( 2.1 ) is convenient for our purpose .",
    "the representation ( 2.1 ) is noncontexual in the sense that @xmath25 is independent of the choice of variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the state @xmath26 .",
    "also @xmath18 is independent of the partner @xmath19 , and vice versa .",
    "as for the @xmath27 dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we follow the concrete examples in @xmath28  @xcite ; on the other hand , in the original model of bell in @xmath0  @xcite the @xmath27 dependence is included in hidden - variables .",
    "it is confirmed that this difference does not modify our analysis and conclusion .    in defining clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality for two spin systems",
    "@xcite , it is natural to consider the quantum mechanical operator @xmath29 introduced by cirelson  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for the pauli matrix and @xmath32 are 3-dimensional unit vectors .",
    "this operator is bounded by @xmath33 the hidden - variables representation is then defined by @xmath34 with dichotomic variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 which assume the eigenvalues of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , namely , @xmath39 .",
    "this is based on the spectral decomposition such as @xmath40 with projectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral decomposition implies @xmath43 with a unit vector @xmath44 for non - collinear @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; note that this operation is consistent with assumed _",
    "locality_.    if one moves to the hidden - variables representation from the last expression in ( 2.6 ) , one obtains the standard chsh relation  @xcite , @xmath1 , @xmath47 by noting , @xmath48 for dichotomic variables such as @xmath49 , while if one moves to the hidden - variables representation from the first expression in ( 2.6 ) one _ can not prove _ @xmath1 in general  @xcite and thus only the general quantum mechanical bound @xmath50 as in ( 2.5 ) . to achieve the conventional chsh inequality @xmath1 uniquely , one needs to satisfy the linearity of the probability measure @xmath51 for any @xmath37 including @xmath37 replaced by the unit operator @xmath52 and for any non - collinear @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the hidden - variables representation ; similarly , the relations with @xmath53 and @xmath45 interchanged .",
    "quite apart from chsh inequality , this linearity of the probability measure ( 2.11 ) , which is fundamental to the formulation of born probability interpretation and leads to the density matrix representation  @xcite , is a natural requirement ; the known concrete hidden - variables models in @xmath28  @xcite satisfy the relation , @xmath54 when this is regarded as a relation in @xmath28 since these models reproduce quantum mechanics , and thus the hidden - variables model in @xmath0 should naturally satisfy the relation ( 2.11 ) if it should reproduce some essential aspects of quantum mechanics .    this requirement ( 2.11 ) imposes a strong condition on hidden - variables models : @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57d\\lambda_{1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relation ( 2.13 ) shows that the weight factor @xmath58 in ( 2.15 ) defines a @xmath28 noncontextual hidden variables model for @xmath36 . note that the relation for _ each _",
    "@xmath59 @xmath60 does not hold for non - collinear @xmath45 and @xmath46 due to the well - known argument of von neumann  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the relation ( 2.14 ) , which is defined by a difference between ( 2.11 ) and ( 2.12 ) , shows that the non - negative @xmath61 in ( 2.15 ) defines a @xmath28 hidden variables model for the same presentation @xmath36 ; namely , @xmath35 parameterizes the functional form of the weight factor @xmath62 .",
    "this shows that @xmath28 hidden - variables model defined by @xmath36 allows a continuous number of weight factors",
    ". it may be natural to assume that the weight factor is uniquely defined for a given representation @xmath36 , which is the case of the models of bell  @xcite and kochen - specker  @xcite in @xmath28 , or at least one may ask no continuous degeneracy of the weight factor . in this case , one concludes that @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 stand for weight factors for @xmath28 models , which satisfy the linearity of probability measure ( 2.12 ) , such as given by bell and kochen - specker .",
    "the factors @xmath58 and @xmath61 in ( 2.15 ) then become equivalent as a weight factor for @xmath36 .",
    "any @xmath0 non - contextual and local hidden - variables model , when the linearity of probability measure ( 2.12 ) is asked , is thus represented by a factored product of @xmath28 models  @xcite , @xmath66 this relation , when translated into the language of quantum mechanics , implies @xmath67 the relations ( 2.18 ) and ( 2.19 ) show that non - contextual and local hidden - variables models in @xmath0 ( local realism ) can describe only the separable pure quantum states  @xcite .",
    "this analysis goes through using projection operators  @xcite and thus it is valid for a general @xmath0 system such as a two - photon system .",
    "we have thus established @xmath6 in ( 1.1 ) as a prediction of local realism .    the above conclusion ( 2.18 ) is compared with ( the contraposition of ) ordinary gisin s theorem which states that @xmath68 for arbitrary @xmath32 implies separable states if one considers only the pure states in @xmath0  @xcite ; we emphasize that gisin s theorem is a quantum mechanical statement and gisin s theorem by itself has nothing to do with hidden - variables models . on the other hand ,",
    "the well - known bell s theorem states that the noncontextual and local hidden - variables model gives rise to @xmath68 for arbitrary @xmath32 .",
    "these two statements put together are consistent with our relation ( 2.18 ) , and this agreement implies that the derivation of bell - chsh inequality implicitly assumes the linearity of the probability measure ( 2.11 ) , on which the quantum mechanical gisin s theorem also crucially depends .",
    "we tentatively call ( 2.18 ) as _ a hidden - variables version of gisin s theorem _ , since it was derived in hidden - variables models . note that we here consider only the pure states in the sense of @xmath0 .",
    "the relation ( 2.18 ) , which is equivalent to ( 2.19 ) , does not lead to any difficulty in connection with `` contextuality '' noted by mermin  @xcite ; for example , the valuations ( which assign eigenvalues to operators ) @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are spin operators of the system 1 and 2 respectively , are regarded as valuations of 3 commuting operators in  @xcite , but these correspond to the valuations of non - commuting operators @xmath74 ,  @xmath75 ,  @xmath76 , in the context of ( 2.18 ) and thus can not be used in the argument of contextuality .",
    "we can categorize three different cases : + ( i ) quantum mechanics .",
    "we can define @xmath77 which assumes values @xmath78 .",
    "+ ( ii ) bell - chsh inequality .",
    "we have a prediction of a noncontextual and local hidden - variables model ( local realism ) @xmath79 and the emphasis here is that this is valid for _ any state _ @xmath26",
    ". we can thus test if a given state is described by local realism . + (",
    "iii ) a hidden - variables version of gisin s theorem .",
    "a noncontextual and local hidden - variables model ( local realism ) describes only separable states and thus predicts @xmath80 and the emphasis here is that this is valid for _ any choice _ of @xmath53 and @xmath45 , including @xmath81 by asking the relation ( 3.3 ) for any choice of @xmath53 and @xmath45 , one can test if a given state is described by local realism .",
    "we here recall the well - known fact in quantum mechanics that @xmath82 for any separable state @xmath83 .",
    "this is because @xmath84 since @xmath85 is linear in all the variables , for example , @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the linear function @xmath85 becomes maximum or minimum at the boundary of the domain , and one can check four corners @xmath90 and find @xmath82 .",
    "the separable state thus implies @xmath91 , and its contraposition states that @xmath92 implies inseparable ( entangled ) states . on the other hand ,",
    "gisin s theorem states that @xmath91 for all the possible @xmath32 implies a separable state .",
    "all of these statements are quantum mechanical ones .",
    "the noncontextual and local hidden - variables model ( local realism ) implies + @xmath93 for all the states .",
    "our criterion @xmath6 of local realism asks that all the quantum states be separable .",
    "we can thus test local realism .    due to",
    "( 3.5 ) , ( iii ) automatically implies ( ii ) , while ( ii ) for any @xmath32 implies ( iii ) due to gisin s theorem . in the analysis of actual experiments ,",
    "however , we have only very limited combinations of parameters @xmath32 , thus the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) generally give different constraints . in the case ( ii )",
    ", one can judge if local realism is consistent with inseparable states by looking at the inequality , while in the case ( iii ) one can judge if local realism is consistent with inseparable states by looking at the equality .",
    "practically , a test of the single chsh inequality ( 3.2 ) corresponds to the test of our criterion with 4 relations in ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) .",
    "our criterion thus tests the more detailed predictions for the same experimental setup .",
    "if one uses only a part of ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) , our criterion can in principle test local realism on the basis of a less number of experimental setups than required for the test of chsh inequality .    the difference between gisin s theorem and our hidden - variables version is also stated in the following way : in quantum mechanics , the pure states in @xmath0 are classified into two categories , namely , for a given @xmath29 , those states which satisfy the condition @xmath1 and the rest which do not satisfy the condition , and those states which do not satisfy the condition are inseparable .",
    "next we vary @xmath29 , and we apply the same criterion to those states which satisfy @xmath1 for the original @xmath29 .",
    "the final result of this procedure is that only those states which satisfy @xmath1 for arbitrary choice of parameters in @xmath29 are separable . in comparison ,",
    "any noncontextual and local hidden - variables model in @xmath0 describes only the pure separable states .",
    "when the analytical expression of a state is given , the condition ( 3.3 ) thus simply states that the state is literally separable , namely , any state @xmath94,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 and @xmath96 stand for the eigenstates of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , with @xmath99 can not be compatible with local realism .",
    "and @xmath100 are real and positive with @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 , @xmath103 and similarly for @xmath104 and @xmath105 by choosing y - axis in the direction of two separated parties .",
    "we performed numerical tests for three cases , namely , a : @xmath106 , b : @xmath107 , c : @xmath108 .",
    "the lines with filled circle , square and diamond respectively indicate @xmath109 in the case of a , b and c. the dashed lines stand for chsh inequality ( 3.2 ) , @xmath110 .",

    "this figure shows that an inseparable pure state can satisfy chsh inequality @xmath93 for a certain parameter domain of the inseparable state . for such parameters ,",
    "chsh inequality can not decide if the given state is inseparable or not .",
    "the choice of parameters in the case b is a well - known example that chsh inequality is maximally violated , but one still sees that there exists a parameter domain , as is indicated by the line with square in fig.1 , for which chsh inequality holds .",
    "note that this is consistent with ordinary gisin s theorem .",
    "similar analysis is performed for a hidden - variables version of gisin s theorem in fig .",
    "2 . to quantify the prediction of local realism ( 2.18 ) , we plot @xmath112 for the same set of parameters as in fig.1 .",
    "this @xmath5 is equivalent to ( 1.1 ) .",
    "we plot @xmath5 for ( 3.3 ) and @xmath111 for the first relation of ( 3.4 ) , respectively .",
    "one sees that our criterion in ( 1.1 ) can differentiate local realism from quantum mechanics for all the given parameter ranges using a less number of experimental configurations .",
    "this illustrates that our criterion is more effective than chsh inequality in negating local realism .",
    "the experimental setups close to the test of our criterion in ( 1.1 ) have in fact been used in the past by freedman and clauser in 1972  @xcite and aspect , grangier and roger in 1981  @xcite .",
    "those experiments are based on the measurement of the transverse linear polarization of the photon , while our analysis so far is based on two - spin systems . to rewrite our relations so that they are used for the photon measurement",
    ", we define the projection operator such as @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",
    "the projector @xmath3 in the transverse direction is then identified with the photon linear polarizer in the direction @xmath53 .",
    "we then obtain the expression @xmath5 defined in ( 1.1 ) . in terms of measured quantities in  @xcite , @xmath115 is written as @xmath116=(0.971 - 0.029)(0.968 - 0.028)0.984 \\cos2\\varphi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 stands for the angle between @xmath53 and @xmath45 .",
    "( note that for the maximally entangled state in quantum mechanics , we have @xmath118 for the spin , while we have @xmath119 for the photon . )",
    "the quantities @xmath120 and @xmath121 are defined in eq.(2 ) of  @xcite , and the numerical factors which appear in front of @xmath122 are also given in  @xcite .",
    "for the ideal measurement , the coefficient of @xmath122 in ( 4.2 ) is unity .",
    "see also refs .",
    "we show this quantum mechanical prediction in fig.3 together with the prediction of local realism .",
    "fig.3 shows that our criterion in ( 1.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) is very effective to test the deviation of local realism from quantum mechanics .",
    "it should be emphasized that the authors in  @xcite have not discussed figure 4 in their paper , which corresponds to fig.3 in the present paper , as a decisive test of local realism ; instead they discussed only chsh inequality as a test of local realism .",
    "this may show that our criterion ( 1.1 ) is not universally recognized as a decisive prediction of local realism .",
    "we have illustrated the practical advantage of our criterion in ( 1.1 ) over chsh inequality using the past experimental setups .",
    "it is rather surprising that , to our knowledge , no systematic use of the extremely simple quantities ( 1.1 ) and ( 4.1 ) as a decisive test of local realism has been attempted in the past .",
    "recently , more and more sophisticated tests of bell - chsh inequalities have been performed  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to look at those experiments from the point of view of our criterion ( 1.1 ) ; since our criterion is mathematically much simpler , it may avoid some of the technical complications involved in the test of bell - chsh inequalities .",
