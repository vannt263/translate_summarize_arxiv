    "the quantum nature of gravity is not yet cleared in spite of endeavor of many researchers . an old idea on this issue",
    "is that gravity emerges as quantum effects of matter fields @xcite .",
    "originally , in such an induced gravity scenario , the newton constant is naturally obtained from the one - loop calculation with a cutoff of the planck scale . in this case , the induced cosmological constant becomes a huge amount if no special choice of the matter - field content is considered .",
    "we will consider a calculable model for induced gravity in the present paper .",
    "for this purpose , we first fix the choice of matter species to cancel the uv divergences . next we should consider the mass spectra of the fields , which affect the finite contribution to the induced newton constant and the cosmological constant .    to obtain the suitable mass spectra",
    ", we use the method of dimensional deconstruction @xcite and its generalization @xcite . in the generalization of the deconstruction model based on a graph ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the graph laplacian and the adjacent matrix gives the mass spectrum of the particle .",
    "thus we can easily control the induced quantities at one - loop level in such a model @xcite .",
    "we also study self - consistent static solutions for a static einstein universe in a graph - based induced gravity .",
    "we have considered self - consistent einstein universe at finite temperature in @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we use the calculation method with the spectral density function of the graph and search for the static solution supported by the degenerate pressure of the fermion at zero temperature .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we will examine the uv - divergences in field theory with the heat kernel method . the way to construct suitable models using the knowledge of the graph structure",
    "is shown in  3 . in  4 , divergences in the effective gravitational action are regularized for a static einstein space .",
    "it is shown that the technique with the density function to evaluate the effective action for an einstein space in  5 . in  6 , strongly - degenerate fermions and a self - consistent solution in our model is studied .",
    "we give a summary and future prospects in the last section .",
    "induced gravity has been studied by many authors @xcite . in terms of the heat kernel method @xcite",
    ", the one - loop effective action can systematically be expressed as an integral form using schwinger s proper time .",

    "the seeley - dewitt coefficients @xmath6 @xmath7 depend on the background fields and the first few coefficients have been known for several types of wave operators .",
    "the one - loop effective action for the background fields is given by the collection of the contribution of various matter fields to the heat - kernel coefficients .",
    "it is straightforward to see where the uv divergences occur , which we are interested in .",
    "the uv divergences arise from the integration in the vicinity of @xmath8 .",
    "these divergences arise from the first few terms of the heat - kernel expansion .",
    "if we manage to introduce a uv - cutoff scale @xmath9 , the lower bound of the integration on @xmath10 is replaced to @xmath11 . to seek the condition for cancellation of uv divergences from various matter fields , we need only to consider massless fields . in the present paper , minimally - coupled scalar fields , spinor fields , and vector fields",
    "are taken into consideration .",
    "the first seeley - dewitt coefficient @xmath12 , which is a constant value , has been found for such fields .",
    "the value for each mode is : @xmath13 for a scalar mode , @xmath14 for a spinor field , and @xmath14 for a massless vector .",
    "then the effective lagrangian at one - loop level includes the following cutoff - dependent term proportional to @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of minimal scalar degrees of freedom , @xmath17 is the number of two - component fermion fields , and @xmath18 is the number of massless vector fields .",
    "note that the spinor field contributes with a negative sign for its fermionic nature .",
    "the expression ( [ 4div ] ) corresponds to the cosmological constant or dark energy , if we treat it as a cutoff - regularized theory .",
    "the less divergent term comes from the coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficient for each mode is : @xmath20 for a scalar mode , @xmath21 for a spinor field , @xmath22 for a massless vector field , where @xmath23 is the scalar curvature of the spacetime .",
    "thus the coefficient @xmath19 leads to the induced einstein - hilbert term .",
    "the effective lagrangian at one - loop level includes the following cutoff - dependent term proportional to  @xcite @xmath24    now we find that , to cancel the quartic and quadratic divergent terms , which diverge as @xmath25 , we should choose @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",

    "if the massless matter content satisfies the condition ( [ cond ] ) , there is no quartic nor quadratic divergence and also no induced gravitational action because of absence of mass scales .",
    "thus we should consider massses of the fields to yield the finite contribution of quantum effects .",
    "nonetheless , for cancellation of uv divergences , the condition ( [ cond ] ) is still necessary .    the algorithm to include the masses",
    "is very easy in the schwinger time integration .",
    "we only attach the following to the integrand for each field @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass - squared matrix for spin-@xmath37 field .",
    "in addition we need some interpretations in this trick . for massive spinor fields ,",
    "we replace @xmath38 spinor fields to massive @xmath39 dirac fields . for massive vector fields ,",
    "we replace @xmath40 massless vector fields as transverse modes and @xmath40 scalar modes as longitudinal modes to @xmath40 massive vector fields .",
    "now we find the additional quadratic divergence is proportional to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass - squared matrix of @xmath43 massive scalar fields , @xmath44 is that of @xmath39 massive dirac fields , and @xmath45 is that of @xmath40 massive vector fields .",
    "finally , the condition for cancellation of the quartic and quadratic divergences is concluded as follows .",

    "moreover , massive fields must have mass matrices which satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we construct the field theory with suitable mass matrices which satisfy the uv - finite condition expressed in the previous section .",
    "now we remember the concept of dimensional deconstruction @xcite , which is equivalent to considering a higher - dimensional theory with discretized extra dimensions at a low - energy scale .",

    "for scalar fields , we assign a scalar field @xmath82 to each vertex @xmath55 of @xmath52 .",
    "a difference can be defined on each edge @xmath83 as @xmath84 thus a mass term for scalar fields can be constructed as @xmath85    for spinor fields , the mass term can be expressed using the incidence matrix @xmath73 .",

    "namely , the left - handed fermions are assigned to the edges while the right - handed ones are assigned to the vertices . the mass - squared matrix for @xmath88 is expressed as @xmath89 while that for @xmath90 is @xmath91 .",
    "the matrices @xmath92 and @xmath93 have the same spectrum up to zero modes .",

    "we found that the casimir regime can been seen .    in the present analysis , we have constructed models using cycle graphs , but we are also interested in the model of general graphs . as future works , trace formula for a regular graph @xcite will be useful .",
    "the universal behavior of the effective action for large @xmath50 and small @xmath31 under the condition of the fixed type of the associated graph , is interesting .",
    "if the construction of the model with dynamical selection of graphs is possible , say , utilizing the higgs - like mechanism assigned at edges or vertices , it can be imagined that many large - scale universe with different newton and cosmological constants would develop once from a single state with a large casimir energy .",
    "anyway , we should investigate some variation of the present model .",
