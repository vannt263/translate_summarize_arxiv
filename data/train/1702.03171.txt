    "the search for signals of physics at the planck scale has become more and more prominent over the past years . since",
    "planck - scale physics is likely to modify the fundamental structure of spacetime and of particles one of the most promising signals may be violations of the fundamental symmetries of lorentz and _ cpt _ invariance .",
    "such effects were demonstrated to be present in certain string - theory models @xcite , in loop quantum gravity @xcite , in noncommutative theories @xcite , spacetime foam models @xcite , spacetimes with nontrivial topologies @xcite , and hoava - lifshitz gravity  @xcite .    the standard - model extension ( sme )",
    "provides a general field theory framework incorporating all lorentz - violating operators that are compatible with the gauge group of the standard model and with coordinate invariance @xcite .",
    "all operators are decomposed into field operators of a particular mass dimension and controlling coefficients that govern lorentz violation .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as background fields giving rise to preferred spacetime directions .",
    "the minimal sme contains all such field operators that are power - counting renormalizable , which is a finite number .",
    "the nonminimal sme additionally includes the infinite number of higher - dimensional field operators @xcite .",
    "the fundamental result of @xcite that links lorentz violation to _ cpt _ violation in effective field theory ensures that all _ cpt_-violating operators are contained in the sme automatically . for over fifteen years",
    ", various experimental tests within particle physics and gravity have been carried out producing a great number of constraints on _ cpt _ and lorentz violation  @xcite . in particular , lorentz - violating nonminimal models have also been proposed to look for unusual electromagnetic interactions between fermions and photons @xcite and in the electroweak sector  @xcite .",
    "modified particle decays especially provide excellent tests of lorentz invariance , which was pointed out even before the sme existed @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent of these decays is vacuum cherenkov radiation .",
    "this is a cherenkov - type process of an electrically charged , massive particle that can occur in a lorentz - violating vacuum without the presence of external electromagnetic fields .",
    "it resembles ordinary cherenkov radiation that takes place for a charged particle propagating through an optical medium when the particle moves with a velocity exceeding the phase velocity of light in that medium . under such conditions ,",
    "a large number of molecules is polarized nearby the particle trajectory , which then radiate coherently .",
    "a similar process can occur in the presence of a lorentz - violating background field that permeates the vacuum and turns it into an optical medium with a nontrivial refractive index .",
    "vacuum cherenkov radiation has already been studied in several papers . in the context of the sme",
    ", it was investigated predominantly based on lorentz violation in the photon sector .",
    "a  primary interest was to understand vacuum cherenkov radiation in the _",
    "cpt_-odd photon sector , i.e. , within , the ( spacelike ) maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) theory . in the classical regime ,",
    "the process was studied in @xcite where investigations of the quantum level were complemented in @xcite .",
    "having established a profound understanding of this sector , the interest changed to the _",
    "cpt_-even modified maxwell theory . in one of the first papers @xcite , the classical regime was investigated again with quantum - theoretical calculations following in @xcite .",
    "recent interest has grown towards vacuum cherenkov radiation for timelike mcs theory .",
    "studies thereof had been avoided before due to instabilities of that framework @xcite .",
    "the calculations in @xcite were restricted to classical electrodynamics showing that there is no contribution to the decay rate up to second order in the velocity of the radiating particle .",
    "the recent article @xcite now also includes the behavior in the quantum regime .",
    "furthermore , @xcite extends our knowledge of vacuum cherenkov radiation of pions producing a novel lower bound of @xmath8 for lorentz violation in the pion sector .",
    "another recent article @xcite even generalizes the calculations performed for pointlike particles in @xcite by taking into account a partonic description of these particles .",
    "last but not least , gravitational cherenkov radiation was investigated in @xcite .",
    "this process is the counterpart in gravity that occurs when the velocity of a massive particle or a photon exceeds the phase velocity of gravity . under such circumstances",
    ", the particle loses energy by emitting gravitational waves .",
    "the needed requirement can be fulfilled in a lorentz - violating gravitational framework .",
    "it shall be mentioned , as well , that vacuum cherenkov radiation has been studied beyond the sme .",
    "the authors of @xcite do not work in the context of effective field theory .",
    "instead , they impose a modified energy - momentum conservation law , which they apply to vacuum cherenkov radiation . a different point of view is taken in @xcite . in their papers , the authors follow a philosophy that differs from the basic principles of the sme .",
    "their intention is to find a modified dispersion relation directly that yields decay rates for vacuum cherenkov radiation and photon decay that have the same characteristics as results based on the sme .",
    "to do so , they claim a generic class of isotropic modifications of photon dispersion relations and they compute the decay rates solely on the basis of this modified kinematics .",
    "the result is compared to the decay rates obtained for the isotropic _",
    "cpt_-even modified photon theory and the spacelike case of mcs theory .",
    "furthermore , limits are set on the scale where lorentz violation is supposed to break down .",
    "note also that there is a framework that is called the `` lorentz - violating extended standard model '' by its founding father anselmi @xcite . despite its name",
    ", it should not be confused with the sme .",
    "the framework comprises an energy scale @xmath9 that is associated to lorentz invariance breaking .",
    "it introduces lorentz - violating contributions into the standard model but it crucially differs from the sme in its footing and spirit . in @xcite , vacuum cherenkov radiation is considered for particular lorentz - violating contributions that include higher - dimensional operators .",
    "the authors find that cosmic - ray data are consistent with a scale @xmath9 that is much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "finally , the author of @xcite uses a logarithmic deformation of the schrdinger equation that is supposed to follow from a nontrivial vacuum structure .",
    "based on this modified quantum mechanics , a modified refractive index of the vacuum is derived .",
    "the latter is then employed to make certain observations with regards to the properties of vacuum cherenkov radiation .",
    "what is still missing to date is an extended study of vacuum cherenkov radiation ( and other modified particle decays ) in theories with lorentz invariance broken in the fermion sector of the sme .",
    "the current article is supposed to improve our understanding of this physical situation , which deals with the phenomenology of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "we are now ready to reach that achievement as the methodology to studying quantum processes of particles with lorentz - violating fermions was developed in the very recent work @xcite .",
    "we primarily consider spin - nondegenerate frameworks in the fermion sector including the @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 coefficients .",
    "however , to perform certain cross checks and to complete the picture our studies also involve most of the remaining families of coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we will review the basic kinematics of the process and a couple of statements will be made with regards to the ward identity when lorentz - violating fermions are involved . in",
    "we will continue investigating the process within isotropic frameworks .",
    "these studies cover the isotropic @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 coefficients .",
    "the next step will be to apply the developed methods to anisotropic background fields , which is carried out in .",
    "thereby , the @xmath0 coefficients and particular anisotropic cases of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 coefficients will be covered .",
    "all results will be compiled in , followed by a set of novel constraints on certain combinations of controlling coefficients obtained from cosmic - ray data .",
    "last but not least , the most important findings will be summarized in .",
    "calculational details are relegated to .",
    "we use natural units with @xmath10 unless otherwise stated .",

    "[ sec : kinematics ]    an important statement with regards to vacuum cherenkov radiation was made in @xcite .",
    "an occurrence of vacuum cherenkov radiation can be considered from two points of view .",
    "first , if vacuum cherenkov radiation is allowed in a certain lorentz - violating framework this points out that such a theory has instabilities .",
    "the latter can most probably be remedied by taking into account higher - dimensional operators , which would finally forbid the process to occur .",
    "the second point of view is that vacuum cherenkov radiation is , in fact , a physical process that can happen in nature .",
    "the absence of this decay then places constraints on lorentz violation . in this paper ,",
    "the second opinion is followed since all calculations will be restricted to the minimal sme anyhow . however , the first opinion has its justification , as well , and it could be elaborated on in a future work taking into account higher - dimensional operators .",

    "( a.7 ) , ( a.8 ) in the latter reference .",
    "this originates from the nonminimal coupling of the photon to the fermion .",
    "we intend to carry out the calculation at all orders in lorentz violation .",
    "so besides the modified vertex , the modified particle energies and the spinor matrices formed from a spinor and its dirac conjugate are needed , i.e. , expressions of the form @xmath30 .",
    "the particle energies are obtained from the condition of a nonvanishing determinant of the dirac operator .",
    "the spinors can be computed directly by solving the dirac equations with @xmath31 replaced by the particle energies .",
    "since the explicit spinors will not be needed in the matrix element square , it suffices to compute the spinor matrices @xmath30 based on the validity of the optical theorem at tree - level according to the procedure described in @xcite .    at this point",

    "let @xmath32 be the amplitude for a qed process with external on - shell particles and an external photon with four - momentum @xmath33 that is described by the polarization vector @xmath34 . in standard qed , the well - known ward identity holds .",
    "it guarantees that @xmath35 when the polarization vector is replaced by the photon four - momentum @xcite .",
    "the ward - identity itself is a direct consequence of gauge invariance and it follows from the more general ward - takahashi identity for correlation functions involving external lines that are not on - shell .",
    "hence , for @xmath35 to be valid for the vacuum - cherenkov amplitude , in particular , the external fermions must obey their standard dispersion relations .",
    "if this is not the case the ward - identity fails and there will be additional contributions to @xmath36 that involve the lorentz - violating coefficients .",
    "this does not mean that gauge invariance is violated , which is not in the sme .",
    "the point is that the standard step from the general ward - takahashi identity to the statement @xmath37 does not work anymore when there are lorentz - violating external fermions involved .",
    "one would have to take the modified fermion dispersion relations into account .",
    "this is essential when computing the amplitude corresponding to .",
    "the amplitude square involves the sum over the photon polarization tensors @xmath38 formed from the polarization vectors of the physical polarization states @xmath39 . in standard",
    "qed , the sum over the polarization tensors is usually replaced by @xmath40 in amplitudes , which corresponds to dropping all terms that involve at least one photon four - momentum @xmath33 .",
    "this is possible due to the ward identity .",
    "however , since it has just been argued that for lorentz - violating fermions the ward identity , as it is usually stated in textbooks , does not hold anymore , we can not follow this procedure .",
    "instead , we have to construct a set of physical ( transverse ) polarization vectors explicitly form the polarization tensors and insert them directly into the amplitude square .",
    "another possibility is to write the polarization tensors in a covariant way but to not drop the @xmath33-dependent terms in the amplitude square .",
    "the matrix element square can be computed such as in the standard case with the standard spinors replaced by the suitable modified ones .",
    "furthermore , the modified interaction vertex is employed but the photon polarization vectors are taken as standard . without explicitly evaluating the trace in spinor space , the matrix element square can be written as follows :    [ eq : matrix - element - square ] @xmath41    with the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath42 .",

    "the object @xmath47 contains the spinor matrices formed from the spinors @xmath48 of spin projection @xmath49 that contribute to the process .",
    "once the process is energetically allowed for a spin - degenerate operator , both fermion modes will contribute , which is why @xmath50 for spin - nondegenerate operators it is reasonable to assume that only a single of the two spin - nondegenerate fermion modes contributes to the decay rate in case the decay is possible at all .",
    "so the usual summation over particle spins is not implemented . instead of the @xmath51 above , the expression @xmath52 for a particular spin projection @xmath49",
    "must be used in the matrix element square .",
    "[ eq : isotropic - frameworks ]    isotropic frameworks shall be examined first because these are usually the simplest from a calculational perspective .",

    "the corresponding threshold momentum is the minimal incoming momentum to be delivered such that the process is just about to be possible . the decay will then occur along a single line as a decay with a nonvanishing angle @xmath55 always requires more energy .",
    "the same argument was used to show that the cherenkov process never occurs for the isotropic @xmath1 coefficients , which means that the threshold lies at infinity .",

    "all results can be carried over to @xmath88 by changing the sign before every @xmath100 , which means that the mode @xmath112 must be considered .",
    "the threshold energy is then given by with @xmath100 replaced by @xmath113 .",

    "cherenkov radiation will be carried out for the @xmath3 coefficients .",

    "a conservative choice is to take an iron nucleus .",
    "however , this choice is made for the fermion mass only .",
    "since the primary could have also been a proton all bounds are assumed to be on the proton coefficients .",
    "a compilation of the constraints is presented in .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , a subset of the bounds is one - sided and the remaining ones are two - sided . the vacuum cherenkov process is rendered possible if either the velocity of the photon is decreased with respect to the maximum velocity of the fermion or the fermion velocity is increased with respect to the photon .",
    "having a one - sided bound , means that this condition is only fulfilled for a particular sign of the controlling coefficients involved .",
    "another reason for obtaining a one - sided bound is that the constraint may apply to a combination of coefficients that has a fixed sign such as @xmath347 .",
    "second , most of the one - sided bounds are lower ones as vacuum cherenkov radiation only occurs when the corresponding controlling coefficients are negative .",
    "an exception are again the bounds on the nonnegative @xmath347 . however , considering only one of the three coefficients @xmath363 nonvanishing at a time , results in an upper bound on @xmath364 . in principle , the latter is equal to a two - sided constraint on the particular @xmath363 .",
    "third , the first bound corresponds to the bound obtained in @xcite , multiplied by a factor of 3/4 ( and with @xmath365 ) , which is a good cross check for the calculation and the argument .",
    "fourth , the absolute numbers appearing in the constraints for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the @xmath5 , @xmath7 coefficients are the same because for large particle energies , the thresholds correspond to each other .",
    "the kinematics of the process plays a primary role for obtaining the constraints where the decay rate itself is secondary .",
    "fifth , the absolute numbers in the constraints of the isotropic sectors match the corresponding numbers in the anisotropic frameworks .",
    "the reason is that the threshold energies for both sectors are the same when the magnitude of the fermion momentum @xmath99 is replaced by the parallel momentum component @xmath205 and vice versa .",
    "sixth , the bounds on the @xmath5 and @xmath7 coefficients are weak compared to the constraints for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coefficients as the dependencies on the controlling coefficients in the thresholds are different .",
    "last but not least , we deduce that the vacuum cherenkov process is highly efficient for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coefficients .",
    "this follows from either the radiation rate or the decay rate whose inverse corresponds to the life time of the high - energetic proton .",
    "hence , a cosmic ray whose energy lies above the threshold loses this energy excess very rapidly .",
    "uhecr originate definitely from outside of our solar system , probably even from outside of the milky way .",
    "so it is granted that a cosmic ray that is detected on earth has an energy below the threshold , which is why the assumption made at the very beginning is justified .",
    "the only caveat is that for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 coefficients , the process is less efficient as it is suppressed by the square of the lorentz - violating coefficient .",
    "this behavior is mirrored in the threshold momenta leading to much weaker bounds on those coefficients .",

    "lorentz violation is isotropic in a single observer frame only where any observer transformation to a different frame produces anisotropies .",
    "since the bounds are obtained based on a cosmic ray whose energy was measured in the frame of the moving earth , the bounds are valid at leading order in the velocity of the earth . taking the velocity of the earth into account , further nonzero controlling coefficients",
    "would be produced that are additionally suppressed by this velocity . to be able to take those into account ,",
    "the equations for the threshold momenta that were derived in the previous sections will , at least , be generalized partially .    in principle",
    ", these characteristic momenta can be obtained classically .",
    "the procedure was already used for the isotropic @xmath5 coefficients in as a cross check .",
    "it takes the modified group velocity of a massive particle as a basis .",
    "the limiting condition for vacuum cherenkov radiation to occur is @xmath149 , i.e. , the incoming particle has to propagate fast then light . neglecting higher - order terms in lorentz violation ,",
    "the momentum components @xmath65 are replaced by the particle velocity @xmath378 via @xmath379 with the normalized velocity @xmath380",

    "<S> the current work focuses on the process of vacuum cherenkov radiation for lorentz - violating fermions that are described by the minimal standard - model extension ( sme ) . to date , most considerations of this important hypothetical decay were restricted to lorentz - violating photons as the necessary theoretical tools for the sme fermion sector had not been available . with their development in a very recent paper , we are now in a position to compute the threshold energies and the decay rates based on a modified dirac theory . the process is still forbidden for the dimensionful @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 coefficients but it is rendered possible for the dimensionless @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 coefficients . for large initial fermion energies , </S>",
    "<S> the decay rates were found to grow linearly with momentum and to be linearly suppressed by the lorentz - violating coefficient where for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 coefficients this suppression is even quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> the decay rates vanish in the vicinity of the threshold , as expected . based on experimental data of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays , novel constraints on lorentz violation in the proton sector </S>",
    "<S> are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the usefulness of the quantum field theoretic methods recently developed to study the phenomenology of high - energy fermions within the framework of the  sme . </S>"
