    "the cool keplerian accretion disc ( pringle & rees 1972 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ) was found to be inappropriate to explain observed hard x - rays , e.g. from cyg  x-1 ( lightman & shapiro 1975 ) .",
    "it was argued that secular instability of the cool disc swells the optically thick , radiation dominated region to a hot , optically thin , gas dominated region resulting in hard component of spectrum @xmath6kev ( thorne & price 1975 ; shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) .",
    "this region is strictly of two temperatures with electron and ion temperatures respectively @xmath7k and @xmath8k which confirms that cool , one temperature , pure keplerian accretion solution is not unique .",
    "indeed eardley & lightman ( 1975 ) found that a keplerian disc is unstable due to thermal and viscous effects when viscosity parameter @xmath9 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is constant .",
    "later eggum et al . ( 1985 ) showed by numerical simulations that the keplerian disc with a constant @xmath9 collapses .    around eighties , therefore , the idea of two component accretion disc started floating around .",
    "for example , paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) described a geometrically thick regime of the accretion disc in the optically thick limit , while rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) introduced accretion torus in the optically thin limit .",
    "moreover the idea of sub - keplerian , transonic accretion was introduced by muchotrzeb & paczyski ( 1982 ) , which was later improved by other authors ( chakrabarti 1989 , 1996 ; mukhopadhyay 2003 ) .",
    "other models were proposed by e.g. gierliski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , coppi ( 1999 ) , zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , including a secondary component in the accretion disc .",
    "on the other hand , narayan & yi ( 1995 ) introduced a two temperature disc model in the regime of inefficient cooling resulting in a vertical thickening of the hot disc gas . here",
    "the pressure forces are expected to become important in modifying the disc dynamics which is likely to be sub - keplerian .",
    "other models with similar properties were proposed by , e.g. , begelman ( 1978 ) , liang & thompson ( 1980 ) , rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , eggum , coroniti & katz ( 1988 ) .",
    "abramowicz et al . (",
    "1988 ) proposed a height - integrated disc model , namely  slim disc \" , having high optical depth of the accreting gas at super - eddington accretion rate such that the diffusion time is longer than the viscous time .",
    "the model was further applied to study the thermal and viscous instabilities in optically thick accretion discs ( wallinder 1991 ; chen & taam 1993 ) .",
    "shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) initiated a two temperature keplerian accretion disc at a low mass accretion rate which is optically thin and significantly hotter than the single temperature keplerian disc of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "the optically thin hot gas cools down through the bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton processes and could explain various states of cyg  x-1 ( melia & misra 1993 ) . similarly , the  ion torus \" model by rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) was applied to explain agns at a low mass accretion rate . however , the two temperature model solutions by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) appear thermally unstable .",
    "narayan & popham ( 1993 ) and subsequently narayan & yi ( 1995 ) showed that introduction of advection may stabilize the system .",
    "however , the solutions of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , while of two temperatures , could explain only a particular class of hot systems with inefficient cooling mechanisms .",
    "they also described the hot flow based on the assumption of  self similarity \" which is just a  plausible choice \" .",
    "they kept the electron heating decoupled from the disc hydrodynamical computations which merely is an assumption . later on , the solutions were attempted to generalize by nakamura et al .",

    "later mandal & chakrabarti ( 2005 ) modeled two temperature accretion flows around schwarzschild black holes in the general  advective paradigm \" , emphasizing possible formation of shock and its consequences therein .",
    "however , they also did not include the effect of electron heating self - consistently into the hydrodynamical equation , and thus the hydrodynamical quantities do not get coupled to the rate of electron heating ( see also rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2009 ) .    in the present paper , we model a selfconsistent accretion flow in the regime of two temperature transonic sub - keplerian disc",
    "( see also sinha , rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2009 ; a brief version of the present work , but around schwarzschild black holes ) .",
    "we consider all the hydrodynamical equations of the disc along with thermal components and solve the coupled set of equations selfconsistently .",
    "we neither restrict to the advection dominated regime nor the self - similar solutions .",
    "we allow the disc to cool selfconsistently according to the thermo - hydrodynamical evolution and compute the corresponding cooling efficiency factor as a function of radial coordinate .",
    "we investigate that when does the disc switch from the radiatively inefficient nature to general advective paradigm and vice versa .    in order to implement our model to explain observed sources",

    ", we discuss the model equations describing the system and the procedure to solve them .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the two temperature accretion disc flows around stellar mass and supermassive black holes , respectively in  3 and  4 , for both sub - eddington , eddington and super - eddington accretion rates .",

    "note that @xmath91 is indeterminate ( of @xmath92 form ) at @xmath85 .",
    "appendix b discusses the procedure to obtain @xmath91 at @xmath85 .",
    "as the entropy increases inwards in advective flows ( e.g. narayan & yi 1994 ; chakrabarti 1996 ; mg03 ) , there is a possibility of convective instability and then corresponding transport , as proposed by narayan & yi ( 1994 ) .",
    "dynamical convective instability arises when the square of effective frequency @xmath93 such that @xmath94 is the brunt - visl frequency given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the radial epicyclic frequency .      in order to obtain the steady state solution , as of previous work ( mg03 , mukhopadhyay 2003 ) ,",
    "primarily we need to fix the appropriate critical radius @xmath85 ( in fact the energy at the critical radius which is not conserved in the present cases ) and the corresponding specific angular momentum @xmath97 of the flow .",
    "the detailed description of the procedure to obtain physically meaningful values of @xmath85 and @xmath97 , to be determined iteratively , is given in appendix a. as the flow is considered to be of two temperatures , at @xmath85 an appropriate electron temperature @xmath98 also needs to be determined ; also discussed in appendix a. note that one has to adjust the set of values @xmath99 appropriately / iteratively to obtain self - consistent solution connecting outer boundary and black hole event horizon through @xmath85 .",
    "depending on the type of accreting system to model , we then have to specify the related inputs : @xmath100 , @xmath17 , @xmath4 and @xmath32 .",
    "important point to note is that unlike former works ( e.g. chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 , chakrabarti 1996 , mg03 ) here @xmath85 changes with the change of @xmath100 , because the various cooling processes considered here explicitly depend on @xmath100 . finally , we have to solve the eqn .",
    "( [ dvdx ] ) from @xmath85 to inwards  upto the black hole event horizon , and to outwards  upto the transition radius @xmath101 where the disc deviates from the keplerian to the sub - keplerian regime such that @xmath102 ( @xmath103 being the specific angular momentum of the keplerian part of the disc )",
    ". figure [ figlam ] shows how the ratio @xmath104 varies as a function of radial coordinate for different @xmath32 .",
    "note that higher @xmath32 , which corresponds to a lower disc angular momentum ( mukhopadhyay 2003 ) , reassembles the keplerian part advancing with a smaller size of the sub - keplerian disc . on the other hand , for a lower @xmath32 the inner edge of the keplerian component recedes . the fact of moving in and out of the inner edge of the disc reassembles respectively the soft and hard state of the black hole ( e.g. gilfanov et al .",
    "hence it is naturally expected to link with the spin of the black hole .     respectively .",
    "other parameters are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 . ]",
    "however , the important point to note is that there is no selfconsistent model to describe the transition region where @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the transition of the flow from the keplerian to sub - keplerian regime does not appear smooth .",
    "this is mainly because the set of equations used to model the sub - keplerian flow is not valid to explain the cold keplerian flow , unless an extra boundary condition is imposed at the outer edge of the sub - keplerian disc .",
    "however , in the present paper we do not intend to address the transition zone ; rather we prefer to stick with the sub - keplerian flow .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) imposed boundary conditions at both the ends of accretion flows along with at the critical radius to fix the problem , at the cost of more input parameters than the parameters chosen in the present work .",
    "but still the transition of the flow from the keplerian to sub - keplerian regime remains undefined .",
    "later yuan ( 1999 ) discussed how the solutions vary with the change of outer boundary conditions influencing the structure of an optically thin accretion flow .",
    "below we discuss solutions in various parameter regimes to understand properties of the accretion disc around , first , stellar mass ( @xmath106 ) and then super - massive ( @xmath108 ) black holes .",
    "primarily we concentrate on two extreme regimes : ( 1 ) sub - eddington and eddington limits of accretion , ( 2 ) super - eddington accretion . furthermore , at each case of accretion rate , we focus on solutions around nonrotating ( schwarzschild ) and rotating ( kerr with @xmath109 ) black holes .",
    "one of our aims is to understand how the explicit cooling processes affect the disc dynamics and then the cooling efficiency vary over the disc radii .",
    "the cooling efficiency @xmath110 is defined as the ratio of the energy advected by the flow to the energy dissipated , which is @xmath111 for the advection dominated accretion flow ( in short adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) and less than @xmath111 for the general advective accretion flow ( in short gaaf ; chakrabarti 1996 ; mukhopadhyay 2003 ; mg03 ) in general . therefore , @xmath110 directly controls the ion and electron temperatures of the disc . far away from the black hole where the gravitational power is weaker",
    ", the angular momentum profile becomes keplerian and thus the disc becomes ( or tends to become ) of one temperature in the presence of efficient cooling .",
    "we first consider flows around static black holes where the kerr parameter @xmath112 .",
    "figure [ figstl0 ] shows the behavior of flow variables as functions of radial coordinate for @xmath113 ; throughout in the text we express @xmath100 in units of eddington limit .",
    "the sets of input parameters for the model cases described here are given in table 1 .",
    "figstl0]a     table 1 : parameters for accretion with @xmath114 around black holes of @xmath106 , when the subscript ` c ' indicates the quantity at the critical radius and @xmath98 is expressed in units of @xmath115    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in general , an increase of accretion rate increases density of the flow which may lead to a high rate of cooling and thus decrease of the cooling factor @xmath110 .",
    "hence , @xmath110 is higher , close to unity reassembling radiatively inefficient flows , for sub - eddington accretors , and is lower , sometimes close to zero , for super - eddington flows . actual value of @xmath110 in a flow also depends on the behaviour of hydrodynamic variables which determine the rate of cooling processes .",
    "naturally , as the flow advances from the transition region to the event horizon , @xmath110 varies between @xmath116 and @xmath111 .",
    "however , if the black hole is considered to be rotating , the flow angular momentum decreases and thus the radial velocity increases . this in turn reduces the residence time of the sub - keplerian flow hindering cooling processes to complete .",
    "this flow is then expected to be hotter and hence @xmath110 to be higher compared to that around a static black hole .",
    "therefore , the system may tend to be radiatively inefficient , evenif its counter part around a static black hole appears to be an gaaf .",
    "however , this also depends on the value of @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alfacom ] .",
    "a low value of @xmath9 increases the residence time of matter in the disc which helps in cooling processes to complete , rendering a radiatively inefficient flow to switch over to gaaf . this feature may help in understanding the transient x - ray sources .",
    "in all the cases , the ion and electron temperatures merge or tend to merge at around transition radius .",
    "this is because , the electrons are in thermal equilibrium with the ions and thus virial around the transition radius , particularly when @xmath117 . as the sub - keplerian flow advances , the ions become hotter and the corresponding temperature increases , rendering the ion - electron coulomb collisions weaker .",
    "the electrons , on the other hand , cool down via processes like bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emissions etc . keeping the electron temperature roughly constant upto very inner disc .",
    "this reveals the two temperature flow strictly .",
    "important point to note is that we have assumed throughout the coupling between the ions and electrons is due to the coulomb scattering .",
    "however , the inclusion of possible nonthermal processes of transferring energy from the ions and electrons ( phinney 1981 , begelman & chiueh 1988 ) might modify the results . however , as argued by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , the collective mechanism discussed by begelman & chiueh ( 1988 ) may dominate over the coulomb coupling at either a very low @xmath9 or a very low @xmath100 . instead",
    ", the viscous heating rate of ions is much larger than the collective rate of nonthermal heating of electrons , unless @xmath9 is too small what we have not considered in the present cases .",
    "therefore , the assumption to neglect nonthermal heating of electrons is justified .",
    "now the future jobs should be to understand the radiation emitted by the flows discussed here and to model the corresponding spectra",
    ". this will be the ultimate test of the model in order to explain observed data .",
    "we have four coupled nonlinear differential equations ( 6 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 17 ) to be solved for @xmath11 , @xmath118 , @xmath14 , @xmath39 ; equations also involve @xmath21 and @xmath22 . to eliminate @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", we use mass transfer equation ( 1 ) and equation of state ( 9 ) .",
    "therefore , in total we have five differential equations supplemented by an equation of state .",
    "hence , we need five boundary conditions to start integration .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be integrated to obtain @xmath100 already given in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , which is supplied as an input parameter .",
    "similarly , integrating eqn .",
    "( 10 ) we can obtain angular momentum flux @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the specific angular momentum at the inner edge of the disc , to be fixed by no torque inner boundary condition .",
    "note that @xmath121 ( see , e.g. , chakrabarti 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore need the initial values of @xmath11 , @xmath118 , @xmath14 and @xmath39 to solve the set of equations .",
    "when we impose the condition that the flow must pass through a critical radius @xmath85 ( around a sonic radius ) where @xmath80 , @xmath11 and @xmath118 at @xmath85 are related by a quadratic equation of mach number given by eqn .",
    "( 24 ) .    for the continuity of @xmath91 , @xmath83 at @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , from @xmath83 which an algebraic nonlinear equation , @xmath118 at @xmath85 can be computed iteratively ( using bisection method ) , which in turn fixes @xmath11 at @xmath85 as well , provided @xmath14 is known at that radius .",
    "now we need to set appropriate values of @xmath85 and corresponding specific angular momentum @xmath97 .",
    "this is fixed iteratively by invoking the condition that the critical point to be saddle - type .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "first we impose that @xmath122 .",
    "then by fixing the value of @xmath123 we find that if @xmath85 is greater than a certain critical value @xmath124 , then the type of @xmath85 changes from saddle - type to @xmath125-type which matter never can pass through .",
    "figure [ apen]a shows how the type of critical point and then solution topology change with a slight increase of @xmath85 . on the other hand , as @xmath85 decreases from @xmath124 which corresponds to the energy at @xmath85 ( @xmath126 ) increases ,",
    "the sub - keplerian disc decreases in size .",
    "this advances the keplerian disc .",
    "the reason is that increasing @xmath126 corresponds to decreasing @xmath85 and then increasing centrifugal energy ( @xmath127 ) which keeps the flow keplerian until inner region .",
    "however , in principle the solution of the model equations is possible to obtain for any value of @xmath85 from @xmath124 to the marginally bound orbit @xmath128 .",
    "once @xmath129 is fixed at @xmath124 , we have to obtain the best value of @xmath97 . by increasing the value of @xmath123 beyond a certain critical value @xmath130 at a particular @xmath85",
    ", we again find a transition from saddle - type to @xmath125-type critical point .",
    "figure [ apen]b shows how the type of critical point and then solution topology change with a slight increase of @xmath97 . on the other hand , decreasing @xmath123 from @xmath130 will tend the disc to more bondi - type .",
    "now for @xmath130 we again have to obtain a new value of @xmath124 following the procedure outlined above and thereafter corresponding @xmath130 .",
    "this needs to be continued iteratively until a specific combination of critical radius @xmath124 and corresponding specific angular momentum @xmath130 , lying in a narrow range , is obtained which leads to a physically interesting large sub - keplerian accretion disc , when matter infalling from a largest possible transition radius to a black hole event horizon through a saddle - type critical point .",
    "however , in principle the solution of the model equations is possible to obtain for a range of @xmath97 such that @xmath131 .",
    "there is , however , another initial value namely @xmath90 at @xmath85 ( @xmath98 ) to be assigned .",

    "<S> we investigate the viscous two temperature accretion disc flows around rotating black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the global solution of accretion flows with a sub - keplerian angular momentum profile , by solving the underlying conservation equations including explicit cooling processes selfconsistently . </S>",
    "<S> bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and inverse comptonization of soft photons are considered as possible cooling mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the set of solutions for sub - eddington , eddington and super - eddington mass accretion rates around schwarzschild and kerr black holes with a kerr parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the flow , during its infall from the keplerian to sub - keplerian transition region to the black hole event horizon , passes through various phases of advection  general advective paradigm to radiatively inefficient phase and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> hence the flow governs much lower electron temperature @xmath1k , in the range of accretion rate in eddington units @xmath2 , compared to the hot protons of temperature @xmath3k . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the solution may potentially explain the hard x - rays and @xmath4-rays emitted from agns and x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the solutions for two different regimes of viscosity and conclude that a weakly viscous flow is expected to be cooling dominated , particularly at the inner region of the disc , compared to its highly viscous counter part which is radiatively inefficient . with all the solutions in hand , we finally reproduce the observed luminosities of the under - fed agns and quasars ( e.g. sgr  @xmath5 ) to ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( e.g. ss433 ) , at different combinations of input parameters such as mass accretion rate , ratio of specific heats . </S>",
    "<S> the set of solutions also predicts appropriately the luminosity observed in the highly luminous agns and ultra - luminous quasars ( e.g. pks  0743 - 67 ) .    </S>",
