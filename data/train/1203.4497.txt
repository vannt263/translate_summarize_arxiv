    "in flares and coronal mass ejections , coronal electrons can be accelerated above 100 kev @xcite , i.e. , more than three orders of magnitudes higher than the ambient coronal temperature of 100 ev .",
    "the energy is ultimately believed to come from magnetic fields through magnetic reconnection , which occurs throughout the corona .",
    "x - rays and microwaves produced by these energetic electrons are observed in both the chromosphere and the corona .",
    "how energetic electrons are transported from a coronal acceleration site to the chromosphere is a key issue in understanding the dynamics of flares .",
    "recent time - of - flight measurements of hard x - ray emission during solar flares @xcite report relative time delays of arrival at the chromosphere by electrons of different energies propagating from the coronal acceleration site .",
    "the energy dependence of these time delays provides evidence that electrons can propagate along magnetic field lines by free - streaming .",
    "however , hard x - ray observations from above - the - looptop ( alt ) sources @xcite suggest confinement of the energetic electrons above the bright soft x - ray loops for periods several orders of magnitude longer than the ( free - streaming ) transit time across the source . increased detection sensitivity indicates alt hard x - ray emission is likely a common feature of all flares @xcite although there have been fewer detections of alt emission than chromospheric emission because the higher density , and hence emission intensity , in the chromosphere overshadows alt emission . in this case , there must be mechanisms that inhibit the transport of electron heat flux .",
    "it is puzzling why some electrons freely propagate to the chromosphere while some are trapped in the corona after being accelerated .",
    "the physics of how energetic electrons propagate from the corona to the chromosphere , and the contrary , how confinement of electrons happens , remains poorly understood .",
    "the transport of electron heat flux has previously been modeled as conduction mediated by classical collisions @xcite , convection at a subthermal characteristic speed observed in simulations of laser fusion studies @xcite , and turbulent transport limited by anomalous resistivity @xcite , also called anomalous conduction .",
    "recent analytical and numerical studies of the transport of super - hot electron fluxes with energies greater than 10 kev show that the classical conduction model is inapplicable because the mean - free - path of electrons exceeds the characteristic length scales of the system @xcite .    in the turbulent transport scenario ,",
    "anomalous resistivity arises from electron scattering by turbulent wave fields excited by instabilities involving the interaction of the energetic electrons , ambient electrons and/or ions .",
    "one commonly considered mode is the ion - acoustic instability @xcite .",
    "when accelerated electrons propagate outwards , ambient electrons are drawn in as a return current .",
    "their relative drift with ions excites ion - acoustic waves , which scatter the energetic electrons and anomalously enhance resistivity @xcite .",
    "the heat flux carried by the energetic electrons is limited by the saturation of the instability due to ion trapping .",
    "the formation of an anomalous conduction front due to ion acoustic turbulence was considered as a means to confine hot electrons for the production of hard x - rays @xcite .",
    "the model , based on a 1d one - fluid code with a grid spacing of 100 km ( @xmath010@xmath1 ion inertial lengths ) , could not capture processes occurring at electron scales .",
    "however , it was argued that the front propagates at approximately the ion acoustic speed @xmath2 and , with some heuristic analysis , predicted that the front would become thinner than the grid spacing , although this was artificially disallowed to avoid numerical instability .",
    "more recently , the existence of a thermal front , literally defined as a region that links plasmas in thermal nonequilibrium and sustains the temperature difference for longer than the electron free - streaming time , was studied in 1d electrostatic vlasov simulations @xcite .",
    "the main goal was to refute the results of an earlier particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation @xcite in which a conduction front was not seen .",
    "the authors observed the formation of a temperature difference propagating at a speed comparable to @xmath2 and identified the behavior as a conduction front .",
    "the physics of the responsible mechanism was not identified or investigated .",
    "we suspect that front to be an ion acoustic shock and the temperature difference to be a result of shock heating due to its extremely sharp transition .",
    "we observe similar behavior in our simulation , to be presented in section [ result ] .",
    "to gain a better understanding of the problem of energetic electron transport from the corona to the chromosphere , an important question that must be answered is whether thermal conduction is suppressed when the accelerated electrons start to propagate into the immediate surrounding plasma .",
    "our goal in this paper is to answer this basic question .    to study the physics at the electron scale and the nonlinear aspects of the problem",
    ", we perform a 2d pic simulation .",
    "we observe that the transport of energetic electrons is suppressed by a double layer that occurs at the shortest scale in a plasma , the debye length @xmath3 .",
    "a double layer ( dl ) is a nonlinear electrostatic electric field localized within two adjacent layers of equal and opposite net charge @xcite .",
    "it is highly localized to @xmath010 @xmath3 because quasi - neutrality in a plasma can only be violated on @xmath3 scales .",
    "it can be understood as a capacitor in a plasma .",
    "an ideal dl is a unipolar electric field , which corresponds to a monotonic drop in the potential across the structure . in most situations ,",
    "however , the potential can contain dips and bumps at the high or low potential sides , but with a net potential drop across the entire layer . the potential drop @xmath4 can accelerate , decelerate and reflect particles entering from the two sides of the dl .",
    "for example , electrons incoming from the high @xmath4 side will be decelerated ( or reflected ) if their kinetic energy is greater ( or less ) than @xmath4 .",
    "dls can be classified into strong and weak depending on whether @xmath4 is much greater or comparable to the mean energy of the reflected particles on either side of the dl @xcite .",
    "much research interest on dls has focused on their ability to directly accelerate particles in auroral ( ionospheric and magnetospheric ) and astrophysical plasmas @xcite . for particle acceleration ,",
    "the potential across the dl is usually maintained by some external energy source .",
    "mechanisms that have been used in simulations to produce dls include an imposed potential drop or current @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "dls occur as nonlinear waves arising from current - driven instabilities .",
    "the dl observed in our simulation is generated by imposing a large field - aligned temperature jump in the initial state which results in strong currents that drive the dl .",
    "parameters suitable for flare settings are used in our simulations and described in section [ sim ] . in section [ result ] , we present the results .",

    "they , however , reveal important physics down to the kinetic electron scale , the debye length , where dls form .",
    "we expect the dl to continue strengthening in a larger domain that allows the system to evolve for a longer period .    applying our results to the above - the - looptop hard x - ray sources @xcite that show an exponential decay on a timescale of more than two orders of magnitude longer than the electron transit time through the source",

    "there are no signs of decay .",
    "since it is driven by the return current electrons , which exist for as long as some hot electrons are leaking out , the dl can persist until the eventual depletion of all hot electrons in the source region , which should take much longer than the electron transit time through the source due to the strong transport suppression caused by the dl .",
