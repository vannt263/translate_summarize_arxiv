    "this paper is on the study of blow up phenomena that occur in heterogeneous media consisting of a finite - conductivity matrix and perfectly conducting inhomogeneities ( particles or fibers ) close to touching .",
    "this investigation is motivated by the issue of material failure initiation where one has to assess the magnitude of local fields , including extreme electric or current fields , heat fluxes , and mechanical loads , in the zones of high field concentrations .",
    "such zones are normally created by large gradient flows confined in very thin regions between particles of different potentials , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "these media are described by elliptic or degenerate elliptic equations with discontinuous coefficients .",
    "the problem of analytical study of solution regularity for such problems has been actively studied since 1999 , and resulted in series of papers @xcite investigating different cases based on dimensions , shape of inclusions , applied boundary conditions , etc .",
    "the main result up to date can be summarized as follows : _ for two perfectly conducting particles of an arbitrary smooth shape located at distance @xmath0 from each other and away from the external boundary , typically there exists @xmath1 independent of @xmath0 such that _ @xmath2 and corresponding bounds for the case of @xmath3 particles and @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that even though in some referred studies it was mentioned on what parameters the constant @xmath5 in depends upon , the precise asymptotics have not been captured , only bounds for it have been established .",
    "moreover , methods in the aforementioned contributions have their limitations , e.g. some of them use methods that work only in @xmath6d , some deal with inhomogeneities of spherical shape only , and the developed techniques , except one @xcite by the author , were designed to treat _ linear _ problems only , with no direct extension or generalization to a nonlinear case .    in the current paper",
    "an approach for gradient estimates for problems with particles of degenerate properties that works for any number of particles of arbitrary shape in any dimensions is presented .",
    "the advantage and novelty is that the rate of blow up of the electric field is captured * precisely * as opposed to the existing methods and allows for direct extensions to the nonlinear case ( e.g. @xmath7-laplacian ) . in particular",
