    "filtering is a process that removes some unwanted component from a signal .",
    "it is a very important task in signal processing , data analysis and communication systems .",
    "many techniques have been proposed for this purpose .",
    "for instance , we can use simple averaging filters such as a gaussian filter .",
    "it is well - known that this filter can be realized by solving the heat equation .",
    "other more general partial differential equations ( pde ) have been used , with non - linear anisotropic diffusion @xcite , non - linear fractional diffusion @xcite or fractional time - derivative @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that pdes are suitable in signal denoising @xcite .",
    "the denoising applications have to take into account two points .",
    "first , we want to obtain a clean and readily observable signal ( improving signal - to - noise ratio snr ) and secondly , preserve the original shape characteristics ( maxima , minima ... ) of the signal .",
    "this task is complex because it is very important that the denoising has no blurring effect on the images and does not change the location of image edges , @xcite .",
    "for some applications , it is interesting to amplify some features of the signal such as relative maxima or minima in order to enhance its contrast .",
    "usually , these features are flattened by the denoising methods based on averaging techniques . among the denoising methods which preserve characteristics of the initial signal",
    "is the savitzky - golay filter , with which we will compare our new method .    a basic and crude idea to enhance the contrast could be to solve the backward heat equation for a few time steps .",
    "of course , this is an ill - posed pde and we do not advocate this unsafe method but it illustrates the fact that enhancement and denoising are antagonistic operations .",
    "our method is based on a linear pde , with two antagonistic terms : a usual diffusion and a nonlocal fractional anti - diffusive term of lower order .",
    "the diffusion is used to reduce the noise whereas the nonlocal anti - diffusion is used to enhance the contrast .",
    "let us emphasize that we perform _ at the same time _ noise reduction and contrast enhancement .",
    "our method is based on the cauchy problem of the following pde : @xmath0 ( x )   = 0 & t \\in ( 0,t ) , x \\in \\mathbb{r } , \\\\",

    "our model is closely related to a nonlocal conservation law first introduced to describe the morphodynamics of sand dunes and ripples sheared by a fluid flow .",

    "we find again this phenomenon for the equation .",
    "the solution of the linear pde is obtained by convolution with the kernel @xmath25 of @xmath26 .",
    "thereafter , this kernel will be our filter for denoising and enhancement of signals .",
    "the analysis of this kernel shows that the low frequencies are preserved , the medium frequencies are amplified and the high frequencies are eliminated .",
    "it is clear that this kernel depends on the parameters @xmath27 and that the choice of these coefficients will determine the quality of the noise reduction and of the enhancement . in this paper , we discuss the choice of these parameters . + to evaluate the performance of our filter , we discretize the pde by two methods : the fast fourier transform and the finite difference method .",
    "numerical studies of nonlocal equations are rather scarce : among them , we mention @xcite which proves the convergence of a finite volume method to approximate the solutions of a fractal scalar conservation law , that is to say a conservation law regularized by a _ diffusive _ fractional power of the laplace operator and @xcite which analyzes the stability of finite difference schemes for the solution of . in these works ,",
    "the discretization of the fractal operator is performed via an integral formula for @xmath4 similar to the ones appearing in @xcite .",

    "this scheme is explicit because the values of the solution at time @xmath96 are obtained directly from the ( known ) values at time @xmath97 . for the laplacian term",
    ", we use a standard centered finite difference approximation of second order . to discretize the fractal operator @xmath4 , we consider the formulation , which for @xmath111,2[$ ] is a causal variant of .",

    "indeed , when @xmath108 , the term @xmath109 in the discretization is bigger and bigger for increasing @xmath110 , hence @xmath107 ought to be big enough .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "whenever @xmath111 , @xmath109 is negligible for large values and is important only for small values of @xmath110 .",

    ", we set the truncation parameter @xmath113 .",
    "of course @xmath114 is an arbitrary limit to avoid rounding effects for small @xmath112 .",
    "since the equation is implemented using an explicit method , this imposes a cfl condition on the time and space steps which ensures the numerical stability that is to say that the difference between the approximate solution and the exact solution remains bounded when @xmath115 for @xmath116 given .",
    "the stability analysis of the nonlocal scheme is done in @xcite .",
    "this requires a careful study , owing to the anti - diffusive behaviour of the nonlocal term .",
    "indeed , the analysis of the pde shows that for the continuous problem , low to medium frequencies are amplified by the nonlocal term , @xcite .",
    "we come back to this in section [ fft ] .",
    "therefore , the standard von neumann definition of stability must be slightly modified . denoting @xmath117 and @xmath118 , instead of imposing that the amplification factor @xmath119 must fulfill @xmath120 for any frequency @xmath121",
    ", we only impose @xmath120 for @xmath121 above a given threshold .",
    "we obtain the two following conditions on the time and space steps : @xmath122 @xmath123 the first stability condition forces the mesh - size @xmath90 to be small enough in order that the diffusion term should dominate the nonlocal anti - diffusive term for high frequencies , whereas the second stability condition looks like an usual cfl condition for explicit schemes and forces the time - step to be small enough . for more details ,",

    "thus , the time and space steps depend on the choice of @xmath3 and @xmath112 .",
    "we begin by consider an electrocardiogram ( ecg ) signal .",
    "figure [ df1 ] illustrates a comparison between the pde implemented using a finite difference method ( fdm ) and the savitzky - golay smoothing filter .",
    "+ the savitzky - golay smoothing filter also called digital smoothing polynomial filter or least - squares smoothing filter was first described in 1964 by abraham savitzky and marcel j. e. golay .",
    "@xcite . essentially , the savitzky - golay method performs a local polynomial regression on a series of values that is to say it replaces each value of the series with a new value which is obtained from a polynomial fit to neighboring points .",
    "the algorithm is based on the following equation @xmath124\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the number of data points , @xmath126 are ( positive ) constants , @xmath127 is the noisy signal and @xmath23 defines the filtered signal .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is the preservation of features of the signal such as relative maxima , minima and width .",
    "indeed , usually these characteristics are flattened by classical averaging techniques such as moving averages .",
    "figure [ df1 ] shows three plots : the noisy ecg signal , the smoothed signal ( red ) using the pde filter superimposed with the noiseless signal ( blue ) and the smoothed signal ( red ) using the savitzky - golay filter superimposed with the noiseless signal ( blue ) .",
    "as we can remark , for these parameters , the low / medium frequencies are not amplified but the relative maxima and minima are preserved .",
    "the denoising seems correct and the filtering with our numerical scheme and with savitzky - golay seems similar , see better .",
    "we evaluate our approach and we compare it with savitzky - golay in section [ metrique ] .    ;",
    "middle : in red the noiseless signal , in blue the filtered signal with finite difference scheme with @xmath128 and @xmath129 ; bottom : noiseless signal ( blue ) vs. filtered signal using savitzky - golay filter .",
    "[ df1 ] ]    figure [ justdenoisingdf ] illustrates two filtered signals of different types .",
    "we start from the simplest possible example of nonlocal filter denoising applied to a signal @xmath130 consisting of a piecewise constant step function @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath134 corrupted by additive gaussian white noise @xmath135 with standard deviation @xmath136 : @xmath137 the result of the denoising is illustrated in figure [ indicatrice ] .",
    "as we can notice , the noise is very well eliminated and we find again our original signal , the shape of the signal has been preserved .",
    "the result is better than filtering savitzky - golay .",
    "moreover , unlike discrete fourier transform where the contrast is low in the neighbourhood of the discontinuity ( see figure [ indicatricefft ] ) , the dicontinuity / shock is conserved . therefore , the finite difference method is more suitable for this kind of signal .",
    "figure [ dfsmtlb ] shows another example of good denoising .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the choice of parameters @xmath138 and next , we give some numerical results based on fast fourier transform ( fft ) which is an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete fourier transform .",
    "we fix @xmath139 .",
    "so , we can rewrite the kernel in fourier variable as follows : @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "we draw in figure [ fenetre ] the behaviour of the kernel @xmath142 for @xmath143 fixed and for different values of @xmath99 . as @xmath142 reaches it maximum at @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    ", we deduce that @xmath146 if and only if @xmath147 . therefore ,",
    "whatever the choice of @xmath110,2[$ ] , we always have an amplification of medium frequencies .",
    "of course , the magnitude of amplification depends on @xmath138 .",
    "another natural frequency is @xmath148 which represents the neutral frequency and satisfies @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "therefore @xmath152 is the threshold above which dampening will occur .",
    "now , we wish to control both the denoising and contrast enhancement . for that , we follow a simple strategy :    1 .   in a first step ,",
    "we wish to control the frequency range to amplify .",
    "this one can be controlled by the following ratio : @xmath153 .",
    "indeed , this ratio is decreasing w.r.t .",
    "parameter @xmath112 and shrinks from @xmath106 to @xmath154 when @xmath112 varies from @xmath55 to @xmath155 .",
    "hence , to choose a given amplified frequency range , it is enough to fix parameter @xmath112 and the ratio @xmath156 ( which in turn determines @xmath157 ) .",
    "2 .   in this step ,",
    "we want to monitor the denoising , which will start for frequencies above the neutral one @xmath152 .",
    "one can easily check the following equality : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a any positive constant .",
    "therefore , the greater @xmath160 is , the smaller @xmath161 will be , which means that the dampening rate will increase .",
    "hence parameter @xmath160 monitors the denoising intensity , this is coherent because it controls the laplacian term .",
    "3 .   to finish with , we wish to monitor the value @xmath162 in order to control the contrast enhancement .",
    "indeed , the higher @xmath163 is , the better the constrast will be amplified .",
    "parameters @xmath112 and @xmath156 being fixed by item 1 it is enough to adjust both parameters @xmath99 and @xmath160 while keeping the ratio @xmath156 within some bounds in order to preserve the amplified frequency range .",
    "the expression of @xmath163 shows that to have a good amplification of medium frequencies , it is necessary to increase @xmath99 as well as @xmath160 .",
    "this is quite natural since the coefficient @xmath99 controls the anti - diffusive term and has an opposite behaviour to the laplacian term which tends to flatten the signal . in our method ,",
    "contrast and denoising are no more antagonistic .",

    "still , when the snr is low - and it is the critical case - the proposed method is more efficient than the savitzky - golay .",
    "thus , the implementation of our pde based on the fft may not be effective for any type of signal , at least when the snr is high .",
    "alternatively , we may use the finite difference scheme .",
    "results of the filtering are illustrated in figure [ snrmseecgfd ] .",
    "as we can see , the proposed model is always more efficient than the savitzky - golay approach , but for low snr the fft scheme remains best .",
    "finally , regardless the type of signal considered , the fractal conservation law is a good tool of denoising , provided that it is implemented with the right method .",
    "let us briefly explain how snr metrics allow us to optimize the choice of parameter @xmath99 . in figure [ snrmsesinusb ] , we display the behaviour of snr values for different values of @xmath99 .",
    "as we can remark , the denoising will be most efficient for @xmath175 .",
    "hence visualization of the surface ( figure [ sinusoidaleaa ] ) and curves ( figure [ sinusoidalebb ] ) enables us to find easily the parameter @xmath99 for optimal denoising .",
    "our first aim was to introduce a fractal conservation law for denoising and contrast enhancement of signals .",
    "this device permits to reduce considerably the noise and to increase contrasts simultaneously .",
    "the study showed that our filter eliminates the high frequencies and amplifies the low / medium frequencies . in this paper , we also discussed the choice of parameters @xmath176 and @xmath112 .",
    "this equation has been implemented using both a finite difference scheme and the fast fourier transform .",
    "various well - known measuring metrics have been used to compare our method with the savitzky - golay filter .",
    "results showed the good performance of our model .",
    "moreover , the analysis highlighted that , depending on the considered signal , it may be more suitable to use the finite difference scheme or the fft algorithm when the snr is high . obviously , for a sinusoidal type signal , it is preferable to use the fft , whereas for a signal like step functions it is better to implement the fractal equation with finite difference method .",
    "nevertheless , no matter the algorithm used , the fractal consersation law is an interesting and natural method for denoising and contrast enhancement .",
    "these satisfying properties for signal processing encourages us to implement it for image enhancement : this study is in progress .",
