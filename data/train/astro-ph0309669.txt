    "it allows us , by modeling the circulation as a solid body rotation , to investigate the longitudinal dependence of temperature .",
    "radiative fluxes in the atmosphere ( stellar and thermal infrared ) are calculated throught a line by line code in the spectral range 0.39 @xmath1 m .",
    "the following opacity sources were included : rayleigh scattering ; h@xmath2 and he cia absorptions ; molecular species such as h@xmath2o , co , ch@xmath3 , na , k , tio ; h@xmath4 bound - free and h@xmath5 free - free absorptions . clouds were not considered .",
    "we calculated molecular abundances assuming thermochemical equilibrium at each level and a solar abundance of the elements .",
    "our bottom boundary condition is set by the intrinsic flux of the planet .",
    "guillot & showman ( 2002 ) showed that an equivalent intrinsic effective temperature of t@xmath6=400k is required to fit hd209458b s age and radius .",

    "a major effect is the condensation of na on the night side .",
    "the sodium absorption present in the hst observations is a factor of 3 less than predicted by most static models ( charbonneau et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "if the sodium condenses in the night side , half of the limb is depleted in sodium , which might explain the weak hst absorption .",
