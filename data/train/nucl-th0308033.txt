    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) from the nucleon , @xmath0 , has played a central role in the development of our understanding of qcd .",
    "application of the optical theorem to the inclusive cross - section for dis relates it to the forward matrix element of the time - ordered product of two electromagnetic currents .",
    "as qcd is asymptotically free at short - distances , an operator product expansion of the time - ordered product can be performed which allows the total inclusive cross section to be related to the forward matrix elements in the nucleon of twist-2 operators involving the quark and gluon fields .",
    "one particularly nice implication of this is that these forward matrix elements correspond to the moments of the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) in the nucleon , where the pdf s are probability distributions .",
    "recently , it has been realized that the off - forward matrix elements of these twist-2 operators are also of interest  @xcite .",
    "of particular note is the relation between the off - forward matrix elements of the quark and gluon energy - momentum tensors and the fraction of the total angular momentum of the nucleon carried by the quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "away from the forward direction the idea of a generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) has been introduced to provide a somewhat unified description of the scattering processes  @xcite . while the forward limit of the gpd s reproduce the pdf s , weighted integration of the gpd s over bjorken @xmath1 reproduce the form - factors of the twist-2 operators in the nucleon ( for a nice review see filippone and ji  @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational scattering is not a feasible option for the measurement of the matrix element of the energy - momentum tensor , however , deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs )  @xcite provides an experimentally realized alternate process with which to explore the matrix elements of the twist-2 operators over a wide range of kinematics .    a significant experimental effort has been mounted to measure the gpd s through dvcs  @xcite . in general , each gpd has three kinematic arguments , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , e.g. @xmath4 .",
    "elastic dvcs with high energy electrons is determined by a convolution in the variable @xmath1 of the gpd s with @xmath5 , and therefore one can not determine the gpd s directly from such measurements .",
    "however , at lower energies and with polarized beams one can determine the imaginary part of this convolution which gives the gpd s evaluated at @xmath6 , e.g. ref .",
    "soft - pion emission during dvcs @xmath7 may provide a background to the elastic process @xmath8 due to limited detector resolution in some experiments .",
    "the matrix elements and cross section for soft - pion emission during dvcs ( dvcs - pion production ) have been computed by guichon , mosse and vanderhaeghen  @xcite using current algebra .",
    "they find that there are no further unknown strong interaction contributions beyond the gpd s of the nucleon . in this paper",
    "we compute the amplitude for soft - pion emission during dvcs ( dvcs - pion production ) using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we find that at leading order in the chiral expansion , the amplitude for dvcs - pion production is controlled by the pdf s and by additional strong interaction parameters that are not related to the elastic gpd s .",
    "this result disagrees with the result of ref .",

    "these operators , along with pion loop contributions , will contribute to the off forward - matrix elements and will provide the low - energy behavior of the gpd s .",

    "we do not go on to compute the differential and total cross sections , as this can be done straightforwardly and does not add anything to our discussion .",
    "the point is that there are additional contributions to the dvcs - pion production cross section that are not related to the nucleon pdf s ( gpd s ) , as encapsulated by the constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "a similar feature is probably true for any generic dvcs inelastic process , where the pdf s or gpd s of the nucleon can only describe part of the contribution .",

    "@xcite makes the more general statement that @xmath92 , which reproduces the @xmath84 result as @xmath93 .    lets consider the implication of having @xmath92 , as claimed in ref .",
    "specifically , consider the @xmath94 isovector operator @xmath95 , which is not conserved due to interactions with the gluon field , and it is straightforward to show that in the chiral limit @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the gluon field strength tensor , defined by @xmath98 = i g g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] , and we have used the equation of motion @xmath99 . in the effective theory , one finds that @xmath100 given that one can not presently compute the matrix element of @xmath101 , and chiral symmetry alone does not relate @xmath58 to single nucleon matrix elements , we conclude that the assertion of ref .",
    "@xcite is false .",
    "there are a few assertions in ref .",
    "@xcite that have contributed in some part to their error .",
    "first , the non - local operator that arises at the scale of the scattering , @xmath102 , was used in all operator manipulations .",
    "the difficulties in dealing with non - local operators are well - known , and efforts to systematize non - local effective field theory have shown it to be significantly more complex  @xcite than local effective field theories .",
    "a straightforward problem with this can be seen in the fact that @xmath103 and @xmath104 originate from the same non - local operator , but their scale dependence due to strong - interactions are quite different .",
    "second , after re - deriving pole - ology ( something that has been well understood for decades ) a central feature of their soft - pion analysis requires them to work at non - zero quark mass , and they are unable to derive their result working exclusively in the chiral limit .",
    "hand waving arguments , including the unjustifiable neglect of @xmath105 $ ] , are required in order for them to consider the chiral limit .",
    "we believe that these two aspects of the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite are flawed . during the thirty or more years since the techniques used in ref .",
    "@xcite were introduced , significant progress has been made in understanding how to deal with the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "we have used these well - known modern tools in our analysis .",
    "we have explored soft - pion production associated with dvcs . using the transformation properties of the twist-2 operators under the @xmath106 chiral symmetry",
    "we have shown that there are contributions to dvcs - pion production that are not related to the gpd s of the nucleon , even at leading order in the chiral expansion .",
    "this contradicts recent claim in ref .",
    "further , the contribution from nucleon structure depends upon the pdf s and one does not need to consider the gpd s at leading order .",
    "therefore , we conclude that dvcs - pion production does not depend only on the gpd s of the nucleon , and gives rise to a presently incalculable background to extracting gpd s from dvcs in some experiments . however , naive dimensional analysis can be used to make a rough estimate of the unknown coefficients , and hence a rough estimate of the size of the background .",
    "it may be the case that a combined study of one - pion and two - pion emission during dvcs will allow for a determination of the constants @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . however , there are additional contributions to this process coming from operators that contribute to @xmath107 but not to @xmath108 .",
    "a significantly more comprehensive investigation is required in order to ascertain if it is possible to disentangle all contributions at leading order in the chiral expansion .",
