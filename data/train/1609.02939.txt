    "the theories of the expansion of supernovae ( sn ) in the circumstellar medium ( csm ) are usually built in a spherical framework .",
    "unfortunately , only a few sns present a spherical expansion , such as , see @xcite .",
    "the more common observed morphologies are barrel or hourglass shapes , see @xcite for a classification . a possible classification for the asymmetries firstly identifies the center of the explosion and then defines the radius in the equatorial plane , @xmath1 , then the radius in the downward direction , @xmath2 , and then the radius in the upward direction , @xmath3 , see @xcite .",
    "the above classification allows introducing a symmetry : @xmath2=@xmath3 means that the expansion from the equatorial plane along the two opposite polar directions is the same .",
    "a second symmetry can be introduced in the framework of spherical coordinates assuming independence from the azimuthal angle .",
    "the theories for asymmetric sns or late supernova remnants ( snrs ) have therefore been set up , we select some of them .",
    "possible reasons for the distortion of snrs have been extensively studied analytically and numerically by @xcite .",
    "two snrs presenting a barrel morphology were observed and explained in @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations of the interaction of an sn with an axisymmetric structure with a high density in the equatorial plane were carried out by @xcite .",
    "new laws of motion , assuming that only a fraction of the mass which resides in the surrounding medium is accumulated in the advancing thin layer , were developed both in a classical framework in the presence of an exponential profile , see @xcite or an isothermal self - gravitating disk , see @xcite , and both in a relativistic framework in the presence of an isothermal self - gravitating disk , see @xcite .",
    "we now present some maximum observed velocities in sns : the maximum velocity for si ii @xmath46355 vary in [ 15000,25000 ]  km s@xmath5 according to figure 13 in @xcite or in [ 13000,24000 ]  km s@xmath5 according to figure 4 in @xcite . these high observed velocities demand a relativistic treatment of the theory . in this paper",
    "we introduce , in section [ secpreliminary ] , four asymmetric density profiles , in section [ secclassical ] we derive the differential equations which model the thin layer approximation for an sn in the presence of four asymmetric types of medium and a relativistic treatment is carried out in section [ secrelativistic ] for two asymmetric types of medium .",
    "this section introduces the spherical coordinates and four density profiles with axial symmetry for the csm : a hyperbolic profile , a power law profile , an exponential profile and a gaussian profile .      a point in",
