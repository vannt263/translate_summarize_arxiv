    "the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation encodes a vast amount of information about structure formation in the universe and about the values of the cosmological parameters ( white , scott & silk 1994 ) .",
    "a number of groups are now making efforts to map the cmb at resolutions of @xmath2@xmath3  arcmin .",
    "two satellite missions , nasa s map and esa s planck surveyor , are scheduled to be launched within the next decade .    in a substantial fraction of ongoing and planned experiments the detector elements are bolometers .",
    "bolometers are thermal detectors and thus have a response time that depends on a variety of construction and operation parameters @xcite .",
    "time constants of bolometers currently employed on cmb experiments are on the order of 10 msec .",
    "the baseline design for planck s high frequency instrument ( hfi ) bolometers is between 2 and 5 msec .",
    "the bolometer response time puts a practical constraint on the speed with which a bolometric experiment can scan the sky .",
    "scanning too fast decreases the sensitivity of the experiment to structures near the beam resolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the scan speed and the detector s @xmath4 noise knee determine the number of time - ordered pixels over which the noise is uncorrelated .",
    "a faster scan speed allows a more robust characterization of the instrumental noise and better recovery of the sky signal over a larger angular range @xcite .",
    "thus there are important trade - offs between the detector noise level , time constant , beam size and scan speed that must be considered when optimizing the experiment . in the case of the planck surveyor instruments , for example ,",
    "a balance has to be found between the requirements of the low frequency hemt - based instrument ( lfi ) and the bolometric high frequency instrument .",
    "the lfi prefers a fast scan speed because both its detector response speed and @xmath4 noise knee are higher than for the hfi .",
    "however , if the scan speed is too fast hfi s performance at high resolution will degrade .",
    "the window function matrix , and its trace , the window function , quantify the sensitivity of a cmb anisotropy experiment as a function of angular scale .",
    "the full matrix contains information about all possible pixel pairs ; the simpler window function , @xmath5 , reduces this to the rms anisotropy probed by the experiment .",
    "a number of authors have analyzed how the beam size and scan strategy determine the window function ( see white et al .   and references therein ) .",
    "it has traditionally been assumed that the bolometer response time can be neglected . with a window function at hand , algorithms have been developed to asses the accuracy with which a given experiment can extract the cosmological parameters ( jungman et al .",
    "1995 ; bond , efstathiou & tegmark 1997 ; zaldarriaga , spergel & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "all of these calculations assume that the experiment illuminates the sky with a symmetric beam and that the noise in the experiment is uncorrelated , and hence that off - diagonal elements of the window function matrix are unimportant .    in this paper",
    "we analyze how the window function matrix of a bolometric experiment depends on the combination of bolometer response time , beam size , and scan speed . when the detector response time can not be neglected , the effective shape of the beam becomes elongated and the form of the window function matrix becomes a complicated function of the scan strategy and pixelization .",
    "furthermore , the standard techniques used to assess the accuracy with which a given experiment can extract cosmological parameters from the data are no longer strictly valid since they assume that the beam is symmetric .",
    "we overcome the difficulties associated with constructing a window function matrix and assessing the performance of the experiment in the presence of an asymmetric beam by introducing a window function constructed from data points pixelized in the time domain .",
    "we use this ` temporal ' window function matrix to evaluate the window function as a function of the detector response time and to estimate the magnitude of the necessary corrections to the off - diagonal elements .",
    "the discussion focuses on the potential reduction in the window function matrix response near the nominal resolution of the experiment .",
    "our analysis and results will be applicable to any asymmetric beam elongation that decreases the nominal resolution in one direction . as a special application",
    ", we calculate the ability of planck - hfi to extract cosmological information as a function of different values of the instrumental parameters .    in section [ section bolometer time constant ]",
    "we derive the effect of the detector response time on the point source response of the experiment .",
    "we then derive the necessary changes to the zero lag window function ( sections [ section temporal window function ] , [ zero lag window function ] ) and assess planck - hfi s performance ( section [ section single point cosmological parameters ] ) .",
    "in section [ two - point correlation measurements ] we concentrate on the full window function matrix in the presence of the beam asymmetry introduced by the detector response time .",
    "we discuss and summarize the results in section [ section discussion ] .",
    "a bolometer is a thermal detector in which absorbed radiation is converted to heat , causing a temperature change that is proportional to the absorbed energy .",
    "a thermistor is used to measure the temperature change .",
    "the temporal response of bolometers is an exponential ; if the bolometer temperature is @xmath6 at time @xmath7 , then upon a step function increase in input power at time @xmath8 , @xmath9 the time constant @xmath10 depends on the heat capacity of the absorbing medium , on the detector s thermal conductivity to its mounting structure , and on properties of the thermistor @xcite .",
    "the exponential response time @xmath10 is a single - pole low - pass filter in the frequency response of a bolometric experiment .",
    "the filter is given by @xmath11 the amplitude response of the filter has a @xmath12 db point ] at a frequency @xmath13 .    in an observing strategy where the optical beam is scanned across the sky the bolometer time constant can be viewed as a single - pole low pass filter in the spatial domain . since all of the effects we will be discussing are relevant only at small angular scales , we approximate the region of interest on the sky as flat and use fourier transforms on the plane .",
    "if we write @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the spatial wavenumber being probed , and @xmath16 is the angular velocity of the pointing on the sky , we get for the response in @xmath15-space @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angle between the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath19 is a complex filter .",
    "its amplitude response is @xmath20 and its phase is @xmath21 the amplitude response of the filter has a @xmath12 db point at @xmath22 which depends on the instantaneous scan speed @xmath23 . from now on we will implicitly assume that , where relevant , the scan speed is constant .",
    "the approximation of a flat sky is valid for regions smaller than @xmath24 deg@xmath25 . within this approximation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the multipole number of the @xmath28 spherical harmonics .",
    "assume that the optical system of a bolometric experiment produces a symmetric beam @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a measure of the size of the beam ( e.g. , the width of a gaussian beam ) , and @xmath31 locates it .",
    "the position @xmath32 is defined relative to coordinates located on the region of interest on the sky . if the beam is swept across the sky at a constant velocity @xmath16 the point source response is the convolution of the beam and the temporal response of the detector : @xmath33 equivalently , @xmath34 where , to simplify notation , we use @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the fourier transforms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath39 is complex , the resulting response @xmath40 is both attenuated and phase shifted compared to the case @xmath41 . a dimensionless figure of merit that quantifies",
    "the level of attenuation and phase shift is @xmath0 , defined as @xmath42 since @xmath43 is the time it takes the beam to cross a distance equal to its width , @xmath44 corresponds to the case where the time constant is short compared to this crossing time and spatial filtering is negligible .",
    "@xmath45 corresponds to the case where the time constant is much slower than the crossing time and spatial filtering is expected to be significant . in the frequency ( 1/time ) domain , @xmath0 is the ratio between the bolometer time constant low - pass filter @xmath46 and the width of the point source response with @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xcite . for a gaussian beam @xmath49 is at the @xmath50 point of the point source response .    the upper panel in figure [ figure one ] shows the point source response of an initially gaussian beam for a range of @xmath0 values . for a nominal two - dimensional gaussian beam , @xmath51 and @xmath52 as expected , small values of @xmath0 result in a larger effective beam in the direction of the scan .",
    "the shape in a direction perpendicular to the scan direction is not affected .",
    "overall , the larger effective beam size will result in a degraded sensitivity to spatial structures which are on the scale of the nominal resolution .    for values of @xmath53",
    "the spatial filter ( eq .  [ amplitude ] ) can be approximated as a gaussian . when combined with a nominal gaussian beam of width @xmath30 the fourier transform , eq .",
    "[ fourier space ] , can be solved exactly , and one finds that the effective beam in the direction of the scan has acquired an additional gaussian of width @xmath54 .",

    "[ figure one ] shows the effective beam shape and the gaussian that approximates it for @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting 2-dimensional beam is elliptical with a width @xmath57 in the direction of the scan and @xmath30 in a direction perpendicular to the scan .",
    "we now quantify the effect of the enlarged asymmetric beam on the window function of the experiment and its effect on the estimation of cosmological parameters . we ignore the spatial phase shifts of the signal . in most real situations",
    "the phase shift will either be small compared to the beam size or the need to accurately reconstruct the beam location ( for e.g. , making an accurate map ) will force experimenters to determine and correct for it .",
    "we begin with the temporal data stream which consists of data labeled by both position on the sky and time .",
    "the signal at a given time @xmath58 is a convolution of the beam pattern with the underlying sky signal : @xmath59 where we have transformed to spherical harmonics in the second equality .",

    "we defer a more detailed discussion of this result to section [ section discussion ] .",
    "the results in table [ table cosmological parameters ] should be read with some caution .",
    "the forecasts of parameter errors assume a form for the covariance matrix ( more precisely , the fisher matrix ; see section  [ section off diagonal elements ] ) which is appropriate for an experiment with a symmetric beam and uniform , uncorrelated pixel errors .",
    "since in our case the beam is manifestly not symmetric we expect these forecasts to be only approximate .",
    "furthermore , our analysis considers quantities in the time domain .",
    "the relationship between pixel- and time - domain is not completely straightforward in the presence of beam asymmetry ; this is a topic of current research . in the limit of many crossings through the same pixel in many different directions ,",
    "the requirement for an effectively symmetric beam is satisfied , if we consider quantities in the pixel , rather than time , domain . in other cases",
    "it will not be satisfied and care must be taken in interpreting the results in table [ table cosmological parameters ] .",
    "white has noted that it may be possible to get a pixel - domain window function that is narrower than the time stream window function that we use here by certain signal - to - noise weighting techniques .",
    "more generally , it has been noted that the least - squares method of wright , which is a variant of the method originally used to make the cobe / dmr maps ( see also @xcite ) , produces a map containing all of the sky information of the experiment .",
    "the method , as implemented in these references , assumes a known timestream noise matrix @xmath124 and uses it to estimate the temperature at a pixel @xmath89 given measurements of the temperature at @xmath89 taken at different times . with an asymmetric beam ,",
    "individual measurements taken at @xmath89 no longer measure quite the same quantity due to the differing beam orientations .",
    "this can be accounted for at the cost of greatly complicating the matrices used in the solution to the problem .",
    "such a treatment is beyond the scope of this paper . for the results of table [ table cosmological parameters ] we used timestream quantities and",
    "the rms window function @xmath107 .",
    "we will return to the question of beam asymmetry and assess its impact on the window function matrix , and on the ability to extract cosmological parameters , in the following section .",
    "finally , the standard analysis , which leads to the results in table [ table cosmological parameters ] , makes several additional assumptions that need to be highlighted .",
    "the actual likelihood as a function of the cosmological parameters will be highly non - gaussian , but the calculations assume gaussianity ( at least near the peak of the distribution ) .",
    "in addition , the results assume that the removal of foregrounds and systematic effects proceeds without appreciable degradation of the satellite s sensitivity .",
    "the analysis in terms of the zero - lag window function is an approximation that neglects pixel - pixel , or beam - beam correlations .",
    "we now assess whether sweeping an effectively asymmetric beam across the sky significantly affects this approximation .",
    "we first parameterize the relative power spectrum errors @xmath125 in terms of the symmetric beam errors and @xmath126 .",
    "the parameter @xmath126 quantifies the ` average ' ratio in the beam - beam correlations between the symmetric and asymmetric beam cases .",
    "we then assess the magnitude of @xmath126 .",

    "we observe the following properties of @xmath168 . near @xmath175 , i.e. , for very long wavelengths , there is no difference whether the beams are elongated or not . as @xmath169 increases @xmath168 decreases for both values of @xmath167 indicating a smaller off - diagonal elements compared to the symmetric beam case .",
    "there is less attenuation for small @xmath167 as compared to large @xmath167 .    to understand this we note that only those @xmath15 vectors that are directed near the line between the two beams contribute to the angular average performed in eq .",
    "[ eq : angular average ] . since the asymmetric beams are most widened in that direction large @xmath169 s",
    "are effectively smeared ( hence @xmath176 ) .",
    "larger attenuation is obtained at large beam separation because a narrower range of wave vectors , and only those that are aligned in the beam elongation direction , contribute to the angular average . within this range of @xmath169 s",
    "the largest attenuation compared to the symmetric beam case is @xmath177 .",
    "this limiting value is also obtained from eq.[eq : offd : largekr ] with @xmath173 which gives @xmath178 .",
    "case 2 is obtained by taking @xmath179 in eq.[eq : offd ] .",
    "the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fixr ] shows @xmath180 for this case .",
    "similar to case 1 , when @xmath181 we obtain the symmetric beam case , @xmath182 .",
    "for @xmath183 there is no change in @xmath141 as @xmath169 increases , and there is @xmath184 change for the @xmath185 case .",
    "the physical explanation is similar to the reasoning in case 1 .",
    "the beams are narrowest in the direction of their separation . for large @xmath167 only those @xmath169 vectors that are aligned with the narrow dimension of the beam",
    "contribute to the angular average in eq.[eq : offd ] .",
    "hence there is effectively no difference between the symmetric beam case and the asymmetric case .",
    "the large @xmath167 limit as obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : offd : largekr ] is @xmath182 . at small @xmath167 values @xmath15 vectors which are in the direction of the beam elongation",
    "contribute to the angular average . in this case",
    "@xmath168 is smaller compared to either the symmetric case or to the large @xmath167 value .",
    "case 3 is obtained by taking @xmath186 and @xmath187 in eq .",
    "[ eq : offd ] .",
    "the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fixr ] shows @xmath180 for this case . for arguments similar to the ones in the previous cases we expect , and indeed observe , little difference between the two values of @xmath167 .",
    "we also observe an overall attenuation at @xmath188 of @xmath184 .",
    "this agrees with the asymptotic value for large @xmath167 , @xmath189 .    within the approximation @xmath190 the largest reduction in the off - diagonal elements occurred for case 1 , and for large values of @xmath167 . for this case",
    "we continue the analysis for larger values of @xmath159 by numerically integrating eq.[eq : wtautowzero ] .",
    "the result of this numerical integration is shown in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fixr ] .",
    "we find that the analytic approximation is excellent for @xmath191 and that when @xmath192 the magnitude of these particular off - diagonal elements is about 50% of their values in the symmetric beam case .",
    "we emphasize that we are considering here the effect of the asymmetric beam _ relative _ to the symmetric beam case . in case 1",
    "the asymmetric beam causes the greatest relative effect at large separation .",
    "however , the _ absolute _ contribution of these matrix elements to the signal at large @xmath27 will be small because large separations sample mainly small @xmath27 values ( that is , the matrix elements are suppressed for @xmath193 ) .",
    "we thus find that for the @xmath27 range where beam elongation is important , i.e. , large @xmath27 , the matrix elements are not attenuated significantly compared to the symmetric beam case , certainly less than the 50% reduction observed for the most severe case at @xmath194 . based on the arguments of section [ section off diagonal elements ] we expect a similar increase in the relative errors @xmath195 .",
    "the change in the relative error expected for any one of the cosmological parameters will be similar or smaller , and thus the major conclusions of table [ table cosmological parameters ] will not change .",
    "our point source response analysis shows that using a combination of bolometer time constant , scan speed , and beam size such that @xmath196 results in relatively small increase in the effective beam size , less than 16% , and the spatial phase shift is less than 0.2 @xmath30 . because the window function encodes information from the nominal beam dimension as well as from the enlarged one the effect of a smaller @xmath0 is less pronounced on the window function than it is on the point source response in the scan direction . in the gaussian approximation the fractional effective increase in beam size derived from the window function analysis is a factor of two smaller than that derived from the point source response ( eq .  [ new 2d width ] ) .",
    "our analysis of the performance of planck - hfi indicates that choosing @xmath197 will not be detrimental to the ability to extract cosmological parameters .",
    "this is a consequence of hfi s small beam size and high sensitivity .",
    "the hfi , with its nominal @xmath198 which range from 725 to 1800 , will determine the cmb power spectrum with high accuracy over a very broad range of @xmath27 .",
    "a degradation of its performance at high @xmath27 values does not diminish its capability significantly .",
    "it will generally be the case that the ability of any experiment with @xmath199 to extract cosmological parameters will not be affected significantly with @xmath200 , if the universe is any variant of the cdm model .",
    "there are strong arguments for maintaining high resolution capability for a cmb experiment .",
    "we do _ not _ know that the universe is any variant of the cold dark matter model , or indeed that the fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "high resolution will undoubtedly be important to test this latter assumption .",
    "also , the ability to remove foregrounds and to detect point sources relies to some extent on high @xmath27 information and the ability to observe small - scale non - gaussian structures .",
    "if we are interested in achieving the maximum possible resolution , we wish to minimize a quantity like the effective 2-d beamwidth @xmath201 .",
    "on the other hand , other considerations will make a _ smaller _ @xmath0 more desirable .",
    "a fast scan speed increases the scale over which instrument noise is uncorrelated .",
    "such broad temporal and/or angular scales can be used to better characterize the instrument s noise , to increase the @xmath27 range to which the experiment is sensitive , or for a better recovery of the underlying two dimensional sky signal @xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath202 argues that we quickly reach a regime of diminishing returns as @xmath203 . for a given experiment the final determination of @xmath0 depends on a global optimization which includes the expected instrument noise characteristics and the targeted science .",
    "our analysis indicates that @xmath204 provides a range over which the small angular scale performance is not affected significantly , while allowing flexibility in tuning either the bolometer response time and/or the scan speed . for the hfi in particular ,",
    "relaxing the value by a factor of @xmath205 , to @xmath206 , may increase the dynamic range over which the instrument and satellite parameters can be varied .",
    "some experiments may choose to use even smaller values of @xmath0 .",
