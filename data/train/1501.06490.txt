    "we present here the notes of three lectures given by one of us at the international workshop on mathematical structures in quantum physics , held in february 2014 in bangalore at the centre for high energy physics , indian institute of science .",
    "the course considers some aspects of quantum systems with time - dependent boundaries , a very active area both from the mathematical point of view , see for instance the works of yajima  @xcite , dellantonio _ et al _  @xcite and posilicano _ et al _",
    "@xcite , and from a physical perspective .",
    "notable applications arise in different fields ranging from atoms in cavities @xcite to ions and atoms in magnetic traps @xcite , to superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) @xcite , to the dynamical casimir effect in microwave cavities  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the role and importance of boundary conditions at a fundamental level have been stressed in an interesting series of articles , see  @xcite and references therein , where varying boundary conditions are viewed as a model of space - time topology change .",
    "these notes will be organized as follows . in the first lecture , in section  [ sec - interval ] , we will study the problem of a quantum particle moving in a one - dimensional box . in particular we will introduce and describe the problem in a pedagogical way focussing on the mathematical aspects of the physical model .",
    "we will try to give all the mathematical tools needed to a deep understanding of the physics of the problem .",
    "moreover , at the end of the section , we will follow berry  @xcite and show how , quite surprisingly , even an easy spectral problem like this can lead to intricate and rich dynamics . in the following lectures",
    ", we will look at the dynamical evolution with time - dependent boundaries .",
    "in particular , in the second lecture , in section  [ sec - mw ] , we will discuss the case in which the walls of the bounding box are moving  @xcite , while in the last lecture , in section  [ sec - change ] , we will look at the problem of the change of boundary conditions with time  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - conc ] we will draw some conclusions .",
    "interspersed between the lectures we offer a selection of exercises ranging in difficulty .",
    "they are useful to focus the attention on specific points and to test the learning of the reader , therefore we kindly recommend not to skip them .",
    "one of the very first problems involving boundary conditions in quantum mechanics is the study of a non - relativistic particle in a one - dimensional box . indeed , it is one of the exercises sometimes professors give to students just to test their ability .",
    "the problem consists in a massive particle moving freely in an infinitely deep well located , say , at @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 , from which it can not escape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] ) .",
    "we will see that even if the problem is apparently fairly simple , it leads to very interesting results that stress the difference between classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , the very presence of boundaries in general tends to enhance the quantum aspects of the system .",
    "the reason is that in quantum mechanics the behavior at the boundary is constrained by the very structure of the theory and in particular by unitarity .",
    "this is at variance with classical mechanics , where the behavior at the boundary does not derive from fundamental principles , and is usually treated phenomenologically .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the system is described by a hamiltonian operator associated to the kinetic energy of the particle , namely the laplacian , @xmath2 acting on square integrable functions ( remember that @xmath3 is a probability density ! ) with square integrable second ( distribution ) derivative on the interval @xmath4 of the box , @xmath5 . in the mathematical literature @xmath6",
    "is known as the second sobolev space ; it is nothing but the maximal domain of definition of the kinetic energy operator @xmath7 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ham ] ) describes the action of @xmath7 in the bulk of the box . in order to get a well - defined dynamics , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) should be equipped with suitable _ boundary conditions _ , which specify the behavior of the particle at the walls .",
    "namely , the wave functions @xmath8 to which we are allowed to apply @xmath7 must belong to the domain @xmath9 the question that here arises naturally is how to choose these boundary conditions .",
    "this marks the difference between classical and quantum mechanics : in quantum mechanics the behavior at the boundary , encoded in the domain @xmath10 , derives from basic principles .",
    "indeed , in quantum mechanics the conservation of probability leads to the necessity for the evolution to be represented by unitary operators .",
    "but unitarity of the evolution is equivalent to self - adjointness of its generator , as stated in stone s theorem @xcite :    ( stone ) let @xmath11 be a strongly continuous one - parameter group of unitaries on a hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "then there is a unique self - adjoint operator @xmath13 on @xmath12 , called the generator of the group , such that @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .    according to stone s theorem",
    "the operator @xmath7 , that generates the dynamics of the particle , @xmath16 , must be self - adjoint , i.e.  @xmath17 in order to find the domain @xmath10 let us consider @xmath18)$ ] ; then a double integration by part gives ( prove it ! ) : @xmath19 the self - adjointness requirement amounts to finding a maximal subspace @xmath10 of @xmath20)$ ] on which the _ boundary form _",
    "@xmath21 identically vanishes , namely @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .    the more common boundary conditions you can encounter in the literature are :    1 .",
    "_ dirichlet boundary conditions _ :",
    "@xmath24 2 .",
    "_ neumann boundary conditions _ ,",
    "involving the derivative of the function : @xmath25 ( of course , the above conditions must be satisfied by _ both _ @xmath8 and @xmath26 in the boundary form @xmath27 ! )    check that the dirichlet and the neumann boundary conditions make @xmath21 identically vanish , and thus , modulo a check of maximality , yield a good domain @xmath10 of self - adjointness for the kinetic energy operator @xmath7 .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of boundary conditions that includes dirichlet and neumann as limit cases : _",
    "robin s boundary conditions _",
    ", that connect the function with its derivative at the boundary : @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] , and @xmath30 is a reference length .",
    "from  ( [ eq : rob ] ) we recover dirichlet and neumann in the limits @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .    notice that the choice of a domain of self - adjointness @xmath10 is not just a mathematical nuisance .",
    "different domains give rise to different physics !",
    "indeed , the choice of boundary conditions strongly depends on the physical behavior of the walls , as we will now show .",
    "let us concentrate on one wall , e.g.  the left one at @xmath33 , and look at the scattering process of a plane wave arriving from the left with momentum @xmath34 .",
    "after reflection by the wall a plane wave with momentum @xmath35 will arise .        therefore , the wave function will have the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a reflection coefficient .",
    "since we are dealing with an impenetrable box , and we assume that the particle does not stick at the wall , we are forced to require that @xmath38 , so that the only freedom left is in choosing a phase , namely @xmath39 .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath40 , corresponds to a phase @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , while neumann corresponds to the choice @xmath43 for all @xmath42 .",
    "notice that in general the phase @xmath44 has a nontrivial dependence on the wavenumber @xmath42 . the following exercise shows that for a generic @xmath45 in  ( [ eq :",
    "rob ] ) the behavior of the walls depends on the momentum @xmath35 of the impinging particle through a nontrivial phase @xmath44 .",
    "prove that robin s boundary condition @xmath46 corresponds to a momentum dependence of the phase shift @xmath44 given by @xmath47 recover , as a limit , dirichlet and neumann , and show that they are the only phases independent of @xmath42 .",
    "the general theory of self - adjoint extensions and boundary conditions @xcite asserts that all possible boundary conditions that make @xmath7 self - adjoint can be parametrized by @xmath48 unitary matrices @xmath49 in the following way : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the identity matrix .",
    "check that if @xmath8 and @xmath26 satisfy  ( [ eq : bc2])-([eq : bc21 ] ) for the same unitary @xmath49 , then the boundary form  ( [ eq : lambdadef ] ) vanishes , @xmath22 .",
    "robin s boundary conditions  ( [ eq : rob ] ) correspond to ( prove it ! ) @xmath53 and in particular the dirichlet boundary conditions correspond to @xmath54 , while the neumann ones are given by @xmath55 .",
    "more generally , by taking @xmath56 with @xmath57 $ ] we can describe different boundary conditions at the two endpoints , e.g.  dirichlet / neumann ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , and include all cases considered above , when @xmath60 .",
    "but , of course the unitaries  ( [ eq : local ] ) do not exhaust all allowed boundary conditions , since they form only a two - dimensional submanifold @xmath61 of the total four - dimensional manifold @xmath62 . thus , where do all missing boundary conditions come from ?    up to now we have considered only _ local _ boundary conditions , somewhat deceived by the physics depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : walls ] : the two walls did not talk each other .",
    "indeed , the unitary matrices in  ( [ eq : local ] ) are diagonal and do not mix the boundary values at @xmath63 with those at @xmath64 ; we missed all nondiagonal unitaries , describing _",
    "nonlocal _ boundary conditions .",
    "mathematics tells us that unitarity allows also for them .",
    "so what physics do they describe , if any ?",
    "in fact , nondiagonal unitaries are describing a physical situation which is different from that of a box with two walls far apart . in order to interact ,",
    "the two ends of the interval should come close , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] , so that the interval should be bent and the two walls should become the two sides of a junction .",
    "in other words , by changing from a diagonal @xmath49 to a nondiagonal @xmath49 we are assisting at a change of topology : from an interval to a circle .",
    "therefore , the geometry that is able to support all possible boundary conditions in @xmath62 is that of a ring with a junction .",
    "if the junction is impermeable , i.e. there is total reflection at the walls , we are back to the interval , otherwise there is nonzero transmission across the junction , from one wall to the other .",
    "an interesting example is given by the matrix @xmath65 which describes pseudo - periodic boundary conditions ( prove it ! ) : @xmath66 by passing through the junction , the wave function acquires a phase @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath67 we get the famous periodic boundary conditions , and the geometry is that of a circle ; if @xmath68 we get antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the phase @xmath45 encodes the properties of the junction , for example the material it is made of , or its width .",
    "in general , if the unitary @xmath49 has no @xmath69 eigenvalues , the wave function @xmath8 can assume any value at the endpoints of the interval .",
    "only the boundary values of its derivative are constrained in some way . on the other hand",
    ", one eigenvalue equal to @xmath69 corresponds to one constraint on the values of @xmath8 at the ends , as for example in the first equation in  ( [ eq : phiperiodic ] )",
    ". finally , two @xmath69 eigenvalues , i.e.  @xmath54 , correspond to two constraints on the boundary values of the wave function , i.e.  dirichlet at both ends .",
    "prove that the unitary  ( [ eq : uperiodic ] ) has always an eigenvalue equal to @xmath69 .",
    "find its corresponding eigenvector @xmath70 and show that the first equation in  ( [ eq : phiperiodic ] ) is nothing but an orthogonality condition @xmath71 .",
    "( in lecture 3 we come back to the geometrical meaning of this condition . )",
    "let us concentrate now on the textbook case of a particle confined in an infinitely deep well , fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions are dirichlet s : @xmath72 .",
    "the dynamics of the particle is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath73 a separation of variables , @xmath74 , reduces the problem to the solution of the spatial part of the differential equation , that means to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator @xmath7 : @xmath75 the general solution is @xmath76 with @xmath77 ( in principle @xmath42 can be imaginary , but see below ) , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are arbitrary constants that can be fixed ( up to a common phase ) by imposing the dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath80 and normalization @xmath81    prove that the normalized eigenfunctions of @xmath7 , with the dirichlet boundary conditions , are @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and that the eigenvalues , giving the permitted energy levels are @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen ]     in the box at different levels of energy ( dashed lines ) . ]    eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) tells us two important things on the bound states of the particle :    1 .",
    "the energies are quantized ; 2 .",
    "the energy is always strictly positive .",
    "the strictly positivity of the energy is a property of the dirichlet boundary conditions . indeed , with the neumann ones the energy of the ground state is 0 , and , more surprisingly",
    ", it is even _ negative _ with robin s boundary conditions !",
    "prove that the ground state of @xmath7 , with the neumann boundary conditions is @xmath86 and has zero energy , @xmath87 .",
    "then , look at the eigenvalue problem with robin s boundary conditions  ( [ eq : rob ] ) .",
    "the textbook exercise of the quantum particle in a box inevitably ends with the evaluation of the eigenvalues  ( [ eq : energy ] ) and the eigenfunctions  ( [ eq : eigen ] ) .",
    "the result is so simple and intelligible that we all felt a profound satisfaction when we derived it in our first course of quantum mechanics .",
    "the simplicity of the spectrum is deceptive and leads us to think that we fully understand the physical problem .",
    "in particular , we are convinced that the dynamics , which is the solution to the schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : schr_eq ] ) , must surely be as much simple .",
    "in fact , this belief is false , as showed by berry  @xcite : the dynamics is instead very intricate .",
    "let us assume at time @xmath88 that @xmath89 , with @xmath90 given by  ( [ eq : v0 ] ) .",

    "derive equation  ( [ eq : finalsum ] ) and show that @xmath107    if we take a closer look at the expression  ( [ eq : finalsum ] ) we notice that it is a fourier series with quadratic phases .",
    "this series is the boundary value of a jacobi theta function  @xcite , which is defined in the lower complex half plane of @xmath92 , and it has a very rich structure investigated at length by mathematicians . for a full immersion in its deep arithmetic properties see the charming `` tata lectures on theta '' by mumford  @xcite .",
    "a simple property is its quasi - periodicity in the rescaled time @xmath92 ( check it ! ) : @xmath108 thus at integer times @xmath92 the wave function comes back ( up to a phase ) to its initial flat form  ( [ eq : v0 ] ) : these are the _",
    "quantum revivals_. more generally , at rational values of @xmath92 the graph of @xmath109 is piecewise constant and there is a partial reconstruction of the initial wave function @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fractals ] . on the other hand , at irrational times , the wave function is a fractal , with hausdorff dimension @xmath110 , as shown in the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fractals ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath111 can be proved to be a fractal function in space _ and _ time , and to form a beautifully intricate _ quantum carpet _",
    ", with different hausdorff dimensions along different space - time directions @xcite .",
    "in this lecture we will try to answer the following question : what happens if the walls of our box start moving ? which equation will describe the quantum dynamics of the bouncing particle ?",
    "the classical version of this problem was introduced by fermi @xcite in 1949 , and then investigated by ulam @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the confining interval as @xmath112,\\ ] ] so that @xmath113 is the width of the box and @xmath114 its center .",
    "we will suppose that @xmath115 and @xmath116 are regular functions of time , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with @xmath119 so that the interval never shrinks to a point .",
    "from now on we will often omit the dependence on @xmath15 .    as we did in the case of still walls ,",
    "we analyze the dynamics described by the schrdinger equation @xmath120 where the domain of @xmath121 is @xmath122 ( dirichlet s boundary conditions ) . notice that this domain depends on time , so that at different times we work on different spaces .",
    "this means that the time derivative , @xmath123 involves the sum of vectors belonging to different hilbert spaces , since in general @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , we need to take more care in the formulation of the problem and in the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mov_schreq ] ) .    the correct formulation of the problem can be accomplished by embedding the space of square integrable functions on the interval , @xmath125 , in the larger hilbert space @xmath126 on the real line : @xmath127 where @xmath128 denotes the complement of the set @xmath129 .",
    "thus , every wave function @xmath130 can be written as a sum @xmath131 , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 . following this strategy the hamiltonian of the system , representing",
    "the kinetic energy of the particle in the box , in the containing space reads : @xmath134 equipped with the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "notice that the choice of the hamiltonian to be 0 in the component @xmath135 , i.e.  outside the box , is completely arbitrary and immaterial , since we will be interested in the dynamics inside the box , for a particle with initial ( and evolved ) wave function with @xmath136 .",
    "moreover , it is worth noticing that even if the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mov_schreq ] ) appeared to be time - independent , the direct sum decomposition in  ( [ ham ] ) , in the case of moving walls , makes its time dependence clear .",
    "indeed , the direct sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l2sum ] ) depends on time through the functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in other words ,",
    "the restriction to the interval somehow concealed the time - dependence of the hamiltonian , which becomes evident once one enlarges the space .",
    "therefore , the schrdinger equation we are dealing with has a time - dependent hamiltonian on a time - dependent domain .",
    "the attack strategy that we will follow is to find a unitarily equivalent problem where the schrdinger operators act on a _ common fixed domain _ of self - adjointness .",
    "let us consider the transformation @xmath137 that acts as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a reference length .",
    "prove that the transformation @xmath140 is unitary and maps the interval @xmath141 onto the reference interval @xmath142.\\ ] ]    in fact , @xmath140 can be rewritten as a composition of two transformations @xmath143 where @xmath144 are two ( strongly continuous ) one - parameter unitary groups implementing the translations and dilations on @xmath126 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : transf ] .    prove the decomposition  ( [ eq : decomp ] ) .",
    "now notice that the domain  ( [ eq : dld ] ) is mapped onto the fixed domain @xmath145 @xmath146 describing the dirichlet boundary conditions in a fixed box @xmath4 , and the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) is mapped into @xmath147    prove that the unitary transformation @xmath140 yields constant boundary conditions only when the latter do not mix the wave function with its derivative .",
    "henceforth we will denote the wave functions in the frame with moving and fixed walls by @xmath148 with @xmath149 and by @xmath150 with @xmath151 , respectively . by deriving the relation @xmath152 we get the schrdinger equation in the fixed reference frame from the one in the frame with moving walls : @xmath153 notice that now the schrdinger operator contains not only the transformed hamiltonian @xmath154 , but also an additional geometrical term @xmath155 let us compute this geometric contribution step by step . first of all the action of @xmath156 on a test function @xmath8 : @xmath157 then , since @xmath158 we have @xmath159 that is @xmath160 with @xmath161 and @xmath162 the position and momentum operators .",

    "therefore , @xmath232 when @xmath233 , and we arrive at the intelligible result that rapidly alternating free evolutions with two boundary conditions @xmath49 and @xmath211 yield again a free evolution , possibly with different boundary conditions @xmath234 .",
    "unfortunately , life is not so easy : trotter s theorem does not hold , because the intersection of the the domains @xmath235 is too small , being defined by too many constraints ( those of @xmath49 and those of @xmath211 ) .",
    "for example , let us consider dirichlet , @xmath54 , and neumann , @xmath236 , boundary conditions .",
    "in this case @xmath237 and in this domain the kinetic operator @xmath238 is symmetric but not self - adjoint ! in other words ,",
    "our common sense tells us that we should get @xmath238 with some boundary conditions @xmath234 , but we do not know , even heuristically , which ones , because the boundary conditions @xmath49 and @xmath211 fight each other and yield too many constraints !    math again comes to our aid : the right objects to look at are not the operators @xmath239 and @xmath240 , but the _ quadratic forms _ associated to them , that is their expectation values @xmath241 and @xmath242 , measuring the kinetic energy of the particle in state @xmath8 .",
    "the crucial fact is that the quadratic form @xmath243 associated to an unbounded operator @xmath165 makes sense on a domain @xmath244 which is larger than the domain of @xmath165 , namely @xmath245 .",
    "thus the sum of two quadratic forms @xmath246 is well defined on wave functions @xmath247 for which the operator sum @xmath248 is not defined , since @xmath249 .",
    "the extension of trotter s theorem to quadratic forms reads as follows @xcite :    ( lapidus ) let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the quadratic forms associated to @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "if @xmath165 and @xmath166 are self - adjoint and bounded below , and @xmath250 is dense , then trotter s formula  ( [ eq : trotter ] ) holds with @xmath251 the unique operator associated to the quadratic form @xmath252 .",
    "the operator @xmath253 is called the _ form sum _ of @xmath165 and @xmath166 .    in our case , we will see that the domains of the quadratic forms of the kinetic energy @xmath254 involve _ only _ the boundary values  ( [ eq : bc21 ] ) of the wave function @xmath255 and _ not _ the boundary values of its derivative @xmath256 .",
    "this will imply that the sum of the kinetic energies @xmath257 is always the quadratic form associated to a self - adjoint operator @xmath258 , namely @xmath259 for example , in the case of dirichlet and neumann we will see that @xmath260 and @xmath261 , so that @xmath262 : alternating dirichlet and neumann give dirichlet .    summing up",
    ", we get that the limit  ( [ eq : evollim ] ) holds with @xmath263 the form sum of @xmath239 and @xmath240 .      for any @xmath264 , one integration by parts yields @xmath265 where @xmath255 and @xmath256 are the two - dimensional vectors of boundary data defined in  ( [ eq : bc21 ] ) .",
    "prove that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tu0 ] ) holds .",
    "notice that , at variance with our starting point , the last line of  ( [ eq : tu0 ] ) involves only the first derivative of @xmath8 , and thus makes sense on a larger domain .",
    "moreover , by using the boundary conditions  ( [ eq : bc2])-([eq : bc21 ] ) we will trade the boundary values of the derivative for the boundary values of the function in  ( [ eq : tu0 ] ) , obtaining the following expression for the quadratic form associated to @xmath239 : @xmath266 with @xmath267 a quadratic form of the boundary vector @xmath255 .    the form @xmath254 is well defined for any integrable function with square integrable _ first _ ( distribution ) derivative , @xmath268 ( the first sobolev space ) . in order to get the explicit expression of @xmath269 and the precise domain @xmath270 we have to distinguish among three possibilities according to the number of eigenvalues @xmath271 and @xmath272 of @xmath49 equal to @xmath69 .    1 .",
    "[ case : k ] if both the eigenvalues of @xmath49 are different from @xmath69 , such as in the case of the neumann boundary conditions , then @xmath273 is invertible , and the boundary values of the derivative can be expressed in terms of the boundary values of the function : @xmath274 therefore we get @xmath275 and @xmath276 , with no constraints on the boundary values @xmath255 .",
    "[ case:-1 ] if @xmath49 has only one eigenvalue equal to @xmath69 , namely @xmath277 and @xmath278 , then , if we call @xmath70 the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath69 , and @xmath279 its orthogonal , from  ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) we get @xmath280 therefore , @xmath281 + prove equations  ( [ eq : perp0 ] ) and ( [ eq : perp1 ] ) .",
    "[ case : dirichlet ] finally , if @xmath282 , i.e.  in the case of the dirichlet boundary conditions , then @xmath54 , so that @xmath283      now we can use the quadratic form  ( [ eq : quadraticform ] ) to evaluate the limit of the alternating dynamics  ( [ eq : evollim ] ) , according to the recipe  ( [ eq : recipe ] ) . by cooking our equations",
    "we will prove that the boundary conditions @xmath234 are given by the composition law : @xmath284 where @xmath285 is a commutative and associative product on the boundary unitary operators .",
    "the evaluation of the emergent boundary condition @xmath234 in  ( [ eq:2evollim ] ) requires the computation of the sum of the kinetic energies  ( [ eq : sumquad ] ) and the evaluation of the domain @xmath286 again , we distinguish various cases according to the number of eigenvalues",
    "@xmath69 :    1 .",
    "when both @xmath49 and @xmath211 have no eigenvalues equal to @xmath69 , we get @xmath287 with no constraints on the wave - function boundary values @xmath255 . by using the expression  ( [ eq : gammau1 ] )",
    "we obtain ( prove it ! ) @xmath288 2 .",
    "if @xmath69 is a nondegenerate eigenvalue of @xmath49 , and @xmath211 has no eigenvalues equal to @xmath69 , then @xmath289 , with the only constraint @xmath290 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath292 where @xmath293 is a function of @xmath272 , @xmath70 , and @xmath211 .",

    "( [ eq:-1w2 ] ) and find the explicit expression of @xmath293 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath69 is a nondegenerate eigenvalue of both @xmath49 and @xmath211 , that is @xmath294 and @xmath295 , then there are two possibilities : 1 .   if the eigenvectors of @xmath49 and @xmath211 belonging to @xmath69 are parallel , that is @xmath49 commutes with @xmath211 , then @xmath296",
    "thus , the only constraint is @xmath297 and @xmath234 has the previous form  ( [ eq:-1w2 ] ) .",
    "+ find how @xmath293 particularizes in this case to a function of @xmath272 and  @xmath298 .",

    "@xmath300 imply dirichlet s boundary conditions @xmath301 , so that @xmath302 and @xmath303 4 .",
    "finally , in the case @xmath54 ( or @xmath304 ) then @xmath305 , so that @xmath301 and @xmath306    summing up , the emerging boundary conditions are given by the composition law  ( [ eq:2evollim ] ) , where the product @xmath285 is given by the cayley transform  ( [ eq : regular ] ) for @xmath49 and @xmath211 with no eigenvalues @xmath69 ( i.e.  free ends @xmath255 ) . on the other hand , eigenspaces with eigenvalues @xmath69 are absorbing for the product , that is all constraints on the wave - function boundary values @xmath255 are inherited by @xmath234 .",
    "in particular the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath307 play the role of an attractor  ( [ eq : attractor ] ) , and when @xmath49 and @xmath211 have independent constraints on @xmath255 , then their composition  ( [ eq : indipuv ] ) is dirichlet , @xmath301 .",
    "in these lectures we have seen that sometimes examples that are apparently very simple may conceal an unexpected rich structure . and in fact they can help us to build and understand general schemes .",

    "moreover , we hope that the references we have provided will stimulate the interest of the reader to go beyond this notes and to get directly in touch with a so active field . for instance , the generalization to higher dimensions is nontrivial and introduce new savory ingredients , because in such a case the hilbert space of the boundary is infinite dimensional .",
