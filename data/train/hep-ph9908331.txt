    "one of the most difficult and less understood problems in quantum chromodynamics is the treatment of the bound state systems .",
    "there are different sources of difficulties .",
    "for example , it is quite a common observation known in the spectroscopy , that the splitting between the vector mesons does not depend on flavor , say @xmath0 which is true experimentally .",
    "this fact can not be explained in terms of the canonical qcd interaction , which is given essentially by the strong coupling constant .",
    "indeed , if expressed in terms of an invariant mass @xmath1 , eq.(1 ) implies that the @xmath2 is dual to a much larger interval of @xmath1 than the @xmath3 because the @xmath4-quark is heavy .",
    "however , the coupling constant runs as a function of an invariant mass , @xmath5 , and is flavor blind , thus the canonical qcd interaction should be much weaker for the @xmath2 than for the @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that something is missing when described only in terms of the perturbation theory .",
    "the strong coupling constant alone does not provide for strong interactions being _",
    "strong_.    consider the scaling of quantum chromodynamics from high to low energies . in the ultraviolet region ( at the bare cutoff scale @xmath6 )",
    "the strong interactions are given by canonical qcd , which is conformally invariant , in particular this means scaling invariance ( there is no scale in the theory ) in the chiral limit .",
    "moreover a perturbative treatment is possible due to asymptotic freedom . in asymptotic free theories ( qcd )",
    "the coupling constant grows at low - energies and gets strong , that stops the asymptotic freedom at some moderate scale @xmath7 .",
    "this scale appears in the theory when the perturbative renormalization of the coupling constant is performed , and the @xmath8 is the landau pole in the effective running coupling constant provided the renormalization group invariance .",
    "this is called dimensional transmutation , when scaling invariance breaks through the renormalization .",
    "then experiment tells us that this is not the only scale in the theory .",
    "there are at least two more characteristic scales in the hadron physics .",
    "the mass gap of the hadron bound state , say , given by the square root of the string tension , where the nonperturbative phenomenon of confinement takes place and the bound states of quarks and gluons form .",
    "the scalar @xmath9-meson sets up a scale of chiral symmetry breaking - another phenomenon of nonperturbative physics .",
    "the scales are displayed as @xmath10 .    _ to summarize : _ knowing perturbation theory alone is not enough to describe bound states in hadronic physics .",
    "+ other difficulties in the qcd bound state problem are of a more general kind - relativistic nature of quantum field theory .",
    "first , the number of particles in any state is not fixed because of particle creation and annihilation in vacuum .",
    "second , there are states with ( infinitely ) large energies .",
    "an attempt to treat both problems was done in @xcite by using the method of flow equations .",
    "the idea is to find a unitary transformation that transforms the hamiltonian operator to a block - diagonal form , where each block conserves the number of particles .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix can be represented in the particle number space as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are projection operators on the subspaces with different particle number content .",
    "the flow equations @xcite bring the hamiltonian matrix eq.(2 ) to the form @xmath14 where the two blocks of the effective hamiltonian decouple from each other",
    ". it may be simpler then to solve for bound states within one block , say @xmath15 , than to diagonalize the complete hamiltonian , eq.(2 ) , of the original problem .",
    "since , generally , the number of particles in @xmath12 and @xmath13 spaces is arbitrary , one can reduce in this way the bound state problem with many particles to a few body problem .",
    "it turns out that the second question on possible presence of the ultraviolet divergences is solved also by the method of flow equations .",
    "flow equations perform a set of ( infinitesimal small ) unitary transformations , where the flow parameter , which controls the transformation , has the dimension of the inverse of the energy square , @xmath16 . therefore by using flow equations to block - diagonalize",
    "the hamiltonian one eliminates the particle number changing contributions not in one step but rather continuous for the different energy differences in sequence .",
    "this procedure enables one to separate the ultraviolet divergent contributions and to find the counterterms associated with these divergences .",
    "this covers the uv - renormalization for hamiltonians @xcite .    _ to summarize : _ more generally , flow equations perform hamiltonian renormalization in the `` particle number '' and in the `` energy '' spaces in the sense that the effects of the high fock states and the effects of the large energies , respectively , are encoded in the effective low - energy hamiltonian , which operates in the space of the few low fock components . + this program was applied quite successfully to qed to calculate the positronium spectrum @xcite .",
    "the key is the validity of the perturbation theory in the bare coupling constant for the characteristic energy scale of positronium bound state . obviously , it is a bad idea to apply naively the same scheme for qcd .",
    "it is not possible to find the fixed number representation for the hamiltonian in the case of _ strong _ interactions , where one does not have any control over the process of the creation and the annihilation in vacuum of bare quarks and gluons with _ small _ current masses . in the language of flow equations convergence",
    "can not be achieved when calculated in terms of bare parameters .",
    "the way out is suggested by nature itself .",
    "one should consider `` _ confined _ qcd '' . by using flow equations",
    "one constructs then the effective qcd hamiltonian @xmath17 , where current quarks and gluons acquire masses of the order of @xmath18 and become constituent degrees of freedom ( see below ) .",
    "the value of the constituent mass plays the role of the energy gap between the sectors in @xmath19 .",
    "schematically , the block - diagonal effective hamiltonian has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constituent quarks and gluons , respectively ; empty cells denote zero , to the order calculations are done , matrix elements . to this order",
    "the different sectors of the effective hamiltonian , eq.(4 ) , describe approximately , when going down , the bound states of mesons , hybrids , glueballs .",
    "actually , such a description with the fixed number of constituents is quasiclassical and nonrelativistic , and is known from the constituent quark model .",
    "physically , the picture is the following .",
    "the strong confining interaction , acting inside each `` diagonal '' ( particle number conserving ) sector , produces heavy gluon ( quark ) only in the small volume  in the `` bag '' .",
    "no free propagating heavy gluons ( quarks ) are produced .",
    "therefore the `` bags '' do not interact with each other , decoupling in @xmath19 and approximating the hadron bound states .",
    "the matrix elements of the `` off - diagonal '' ( particle number changing ) sectors are governed by the canonical interaction  typically by the coulomb term of the strength equal to the inverse of bohr radius or the current quark mass , @xmath23 is of the order of several @xmath24 . in the presence of the strong confining interaction in the `` diagonal '' sectors the mixing between the sectors",
    "is strongly suppressed .",
    "one can introduce a small parameter , say , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the coulomb interaction , and @xmath27 is the energy difference between the first and the second `` diagonal '' sectors .",
    "perturbation theory with respect to the small parameter , eq.(5 ) , holds between the sectors ( but not inside the sector where the confining interaction is strong ) . by applying flow equations to block - diagonalize the hamiltonian one gets to leading order a closed chain of decoupled equations , which can be solved analytically .",
    "the whole is true provided there is a strong confining interaction in the `` diagonal '' sectors .",
    "_ to summarize : _ in the theory of strong interactions confinement is important to provide the bound states . in the present approach confinement",
    "makes it possible to bring , by flow equations , the qcd hamiltonian to a block - diagonal form with a fixed number of quasiparticles in each sector .",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom ( quasiparticles ) become constituent quarks and gluons , which acquire masses of order @xmath28 .",
    "the block - diagonal effective hamiltonian approximately describes then the different hadronic bound states .",
    "+ the main idea of the approach is to find the representation for qcd hamiltonian with the fixed number of quasiparticles , where the sectors with different particle number content decouple from each other .",
    "there can be some special cases when one should take into account the mixing between the sectors .",
    "in other words the physical state is not given by the pure component of the composite system .",
    "the mixing between the high excited state from the previous sector and the ground state from the next sector of the effective hamiltonian may be possible ( for example , the mixing between some excited meson and the low lying hybrid state ) . in systems with light quarks",
    "the influence of coupled channels can be essential . in the strongly coupled effective meson models one includes the effects from the coupled channels directly by mixing the scalar and pseudoscalar channels ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the effect is about @xmath31 percent .",
    "special consideration is required in the case of the light quarks , where chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) is important . the present approach includes confinement and is like the `` bag model '' or the `` constituent quark model '' , but it does not include csb . by implementing csb in this picture , the scalar @xmath9-meson can be viewed as a bound state of the two constituent quarks and simultaneously manifests the goldstone nature .    _",
    "motivation : _ in order to disentangle the both problems of confinement and csb we consider the pure gluodynamics ( see the next section ) @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this study is to set up a kind of a constituent gluon model , with the confining interaction imposed , to describe glueball bound states .",
    "+ the specific difficulty of qcd is that the canonical qcd lagrangian does not manifest explicitly confinement . as far as the mechanism of confinement",
    "is concerned one can proceed along several ways . to reveal confinement one uses the suitable formulation of qcd : lattice form , or the special choice of the gauge fixing ( for example , maximal abelian projection ) .",
    "another option is to study other than qcd theories , but that have the same infrared behavior as qcd and are confined : super yang mills theory , some toy gauge models ( for example , abelian higgs model ) .",
    "there may appear some unphysical degrees of freedom in these theories .",
    "if one is not interested in the mechanism of confinement , one includes the latter explicitly into qcd .",
    "the simplest way is to use the potential model , successfully tested in phenomenology , where the potential between the color charges is given by a sum of coulomb and confining interactions .",
    "this suggest the definite choice of the gauge for the hamiltonian .",
    "we work in the coulomb gauge , where the coulomb interaction arises from the gauge fixing procedure .",
    "we add then confinement to be able to block - diagonalize to the effective hamiltonian , which describes the bound states .",
    "the coulomb gauge is the natural gauge to get the constituent hadron picture .",
    "the coulomb interaction appears there not as a perturbative ( propagating in time ) one gluon exchange , but rather as a solution of the gauge fixing constrains .",
    "therefore the coulomb term describes an instantaneous interaction , which is consistent with the nonpropagating massive gluon arising in our approach .",
    "note , that the massive gluon mode arises only in the presence of confinement and confinement sets the scale for the gluon mass .",
    "the obvious drawback of the approach is the violation of the gauge invariance by the massive gauge fields .    _ to summarize : _ the coulomb gauge has an appealing property of the simple extension of the model to the confining case and is consistent with the constituent picture for hadrons .",
    "as noted above we applied the method to pure gluodynamics @xcite . in this section",
    "we outline the strategy of this study .",
    "\\1 . _ qcd @xmath32 . _ + the starting point is the canonical qcd hamiltonian ( pure gluodynamics ) in the coulomb gauge @xmath33 : @xmath34 , where physical degrees of freedom are the transverse gauge fields @xmath35 and their conjugate transverse momenta @xmath36 .",
    "_ @xmath37 .",
    "_ + we expand the canonical qcd hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge perturbatively to the second order in the bare coupling constant .",

    "we express the canonical qcd hamiltonian ( section 2 ) in this perturbative fock space , and normal order the result with respect to the trivial vacuum state @xmath38 .",

    "this is the first time when we have introduced an energy scale in the theory  the bare cutoff @xmath6 . to remove the cutoff sensitivity we renormalize the hamiltonian by adding the counterterms associated with these divergences",
    "schematically , the renormalized hamiltonian is written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a set of ( unknown ) counterterm operators , which we define further . , where @xmath46 stands for normal ordering in the ( perturbative ) vacuum ]    \\5 .",

    "_ + to find the explicit form of the counterterms and to scale down the hamiltonian we run flow equations perturbatively .",

    ", where @xmath47 is the flow parameter with the connection to the energy scale @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the initial value corresponding to the bare cutoff @xmath50 introduced by the regularization before ( section 4 ) . ] technically , since the hamiltonian depends on the cutoff scale through the flow parameter , one finds in the given order of perturbation theory ( pt ) the divergent part of the difference between the hamiltonian operators given at the two scales , say @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "one absorbs then these divergences in the counterterms  local operators with the symmetries of the canonical hamiltonian , to provide the renormalization group invariance ( called in the context of hamiltonian renormalization `` coupling coherence '' @xcite ) .",
    "this completes the procedure of renormalization , performed by flow equations , to this order .",
    "one can proceed in this way order by order in pt to find ( all ) the counterterms systematically .",
    "note , that it is enough to find the gradient of the hamiltonian in the energy space to define the counterterms .",
    "renormalization group invariance ( rgi ) insures , that the renormalized hamiltonian preserves the form of the ( original ) canonical hamiltonian , but only the coupling constants and the mass operators ( that are usually classified as relevant and marginal operators in renormalization group sense ) start to run with the cutoff scale .",

    "due to the rgi the `` physical gluon '' stays massless through this perturbative scaling .",
    "we can not proceed with flow equations perturbatively further .",

    "( it is a consequence of the rgi ) .",
    "we denote the resulting renormalized hamiltonian at the scale @xmath8 as @xmath54 .",
