    "it has no spin - orbit partner in the vicinity , as the lowest spin @xmath10 state is @xmath11 .",

    "we also expect that such @xmath12 bound states with large binding energies can be regarded as compact 5-quark states .",
    "the 5-quark picture of @xmath16 has advantages that all five quarks can be placed in the lowest - lying @xmath17 state to form a negative - parity baryon , and also that it requires no spin - orbit partner of @xmath7 .",
    "the property of @xmath7 can therefore be an important clue to new paradigm in hadron physics .",
    "we here study properties of @xmath16 using the lattice qcd formulation .",
    "lattice qcd is nowadays employed as a very powerful tool for nonperturbative analysis directly based on qcd , and expected to cast light on the nature of @xmath7 in a model - independent way .",
    "though several lattice qcd studies on @xmath7 have been performed so far  @xcite , most of them are based on quenched qcd and few lattice qcd studies succeeded in reproducing the mass of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , little has been discussed on the lattice about the possible mixing of flavor - su(3)-octet and -singlet components induced by the symmetry breaking .",
    "several possible reasons for the failure of reproducing @xmath7 in lattice qcd were suggested through these studies , such as missing meson - baryon components due to quenching , exotic ( non-3-quark type ) structure of @xmath7 , or insufficiency of the lattice volume in the simulations . resolving such difficulties requires unquenched lattice qcd calculation on a larger lattice volume with varieties of interpolating operators .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at clarifying the properties of @xmath7 with two - flavor full lattice qcd , adopting the `` octet '' and `` singlet '' baryon operators to construct correlation matrices , which enables us to extract the low - lying spectrum as well as the mixing between octet and singles components in @xmath7 .",

    "the second state , which is less than 100 mev above the ground state , is predominantly flavor octet .",
    "thus we find that the first two negative - parity @xmath0 s have different flavor structures .",
    "they , however , come significantly heavier than the experimentally observed lowest - mass state , @xmath16 .",
    "one naive possibility is that the obtained states do not correspond to the physical @xmath16 , but describe excited @xmath0 states .",
    "in fact , the 2nd and 3rd negative - parity states lie at 1670 mev and 1800 mev , both of which are three - star states in the particle data group classification .",

    "each of these states is classified as a flavor octet p - wave baryon .",
    "we , however , have shown that the lower state is dominated by a flavor - singlet component .",
    "so , the results here predict one flavor - singlet state and one flavor - octet state in the vicinity .",
    "the reason for missing @xmath16 state will be its poor overlap with three - quark operators . in fact , the inclusion of dynamical quarks does not strongly enhance the signals of possible meson - baryon scattering states .",
    "( see the later discussions . )",
    "if @xmath7 is predominantly a meson - baryon molecular state , such overlaps would be naturally small .",
    "the other possibility is , of course , that the lowest and the 2nd - lowest states describe physical @xmath16 and @xmath26 but the masses have been overestimated . considering that our simulation contains two - flavor dynamical quarks ,",
    "the failure of obtaining a light @xmath0 state could be attributed either to ( 1 ) strange - quark quenching , ( 2 ) insufficient lattice volume or ( 3 ) lack of chiral symmetry .",
    "in fact , ( 1 ) seems to make the masses of octet baryons in positive parity channel slightly ( @xmath115 ) overestimated in the present setups  @xcite . on the other hand , the deficiencies,(2 ) and ( 3 ) ,",
    "may cause the lowest state not properly reproduced , supposing that the main component of @xmath7 is a meson - baryon molecular state . in order to check",
    "whether this conjecture is correct , simulations with light dynamical quarks ( @xmath116 mev ) and larger volume ( @xmath117 fm ) will be required .    upon the above conjecture",
    ", we can further consider one interesting scenario that these states both correspond to the physical @xmath16 .",
    "then , the results may support its double pole structure proposed by the chiral unitary approach  @xcite . in our results ,",
    "the lowest two states are almost degenerate at all the @xmath3 s ( lattice spacing ) and @xmath41 s ( quark masses ) .",
    "namely , the obtained two states are the signature of the double - pole resonance , but the mass has not yet been reproduced because of the deficiency stated above .",
    "it is also important to note the missing meson - baryon scattering states . despite that dynamical up and down quarks",
    "are included and the meson - baryon thresholds appear around / below the obtained eigen - energies , we have found no clear signal of the meson - baryon scattering states . this fact is supported by the observation that the effective mass plots under the normal and twisted boundary conditions show no prominent differences .",

    "they are obtained on the @xmath118 lattice with the largest hopping parameter .",
    "thus we conclude that no scattering states appear in the present spectrum . also in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which excited - state nucleon spectrum was systematically and extensively investigated with two - flavors of dynamical quarks , no clear signal of scattering states was found and the importance of multi - quark operators was raised .",
    "a similar situation can be found in the computation of the wilson loops , whose expectation values give us the potential between a ( heavy fundamental ) quark and an antiquark . in the presence of dynamical quarks ,",
    "such an interquark potential should saturate and flatten at some interquark distance , where the confining string is broken and a quark - antiquark pair is created .",
    "however , no one has ever observed successfully such a `` string breaking '' effect in the wilson loop computations  @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the wilson loop itself has poor overlaps with such broken strings .    in the @xmath0 spectrum",
    ", we may similarly conjecture that the scattering states or broad resonances , which are sensitive to boundary conditions , have little overlap with the 3-quark interpolating field operators .",
    "more detailed investigation would be needed for clarification of scattering states purely induced by dynamical quarks .",
    "the flavor structures of the @xmath0 states have been very well clarified using the variational method .",
    "the octet and the singlet components are mixed when the flavor - su(3 ) symmetry is broken . actually , the ground ( 1st - excited ) state is dominated by singlet ( octet ) component , and the contamination by another representation is at most 20% ( 5% when squared ) in our present analysis . from these findings",
    ", we expect that the flavor - su(3 ) symmetry is not largely broken .",
    "a similar conclusion was also derived for the study of the meson - baryon coupling constants in lattice qcd  @xcite .    because the su(3 ) breaking effect seems small , the analyses without su(3 ) mixings adopted so far  @xcite make sense to some extent .",
    "the mixings , however , get larger towards the chiral limit , variational analyses could be essentially needed when we adopt much lighter quarks .",
    "we also find the meson - baryon contents in each state strongly depend on the meson - baryon couplings and their signs .",

    "<S> low - lying @xmath0 baryons with spin 1/2 are analyzed in full ( unquenched ) lattice qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we construct @xmath1 cross correlators from flavor su(3 ) `` octet '' and `` singlet '' baryon operators , and diagonalize them so as to extract information of two low - lying states for each parity . </S>",
    "<S> the two - flavor cp - pacs gauge configurations are used , which are generated in the renormalization - group improved gauge action and the @xmath2-improved quark action . </S>",
    "<S> three different @xmath3 s , @xmath4 , 1.95 and 2.10 , are employed , whose corresponding lattice spacings are @xmath5 , 0.1555 and 0.1076 fm . for each cutoff , we use four hopping parameters , ( @xmath6 ) , which correspond to the pion masses ranging about from 500 mev to 1.1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> results indicate that there are two negative - parity @xmath0 states nearly degenerate at around 1.6 gev , while no state as low as @xmath7 is observed . by decomposing the flavor components of each state , we find that the lowest ( 1st - excited ) negative - parity state is dominated by flavor - singlet ( flavor - octet ) component . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss meson - baryon components of each state , which has drawn considerable attention in the context of multi - quark pictures of @xmath7 . </S>"
