    "the classical theory of nucleated polymerisation@xcite describes the growth of filamentous structures formed through homogeneous nucleation@xcite .",
    "this framework was initially developed by oosawa and coworkers in the 1960s@xcite to describe the formation of biofilaments , including actin and tubulin .",
    "this theory has been generalised to include secondary nucleation processes by eaton and ferrone@xcite in the context of their pioneering work elucidating the polymerisation of sickle haemoglobin , and by wegner@xcite in order to include fragmentation processes into the growth model for actin filaments .    for irreversible growth in the absence of pre - formed seed material and secondary nucleation pathways , in 1962",
    "oosawa presented solutions to the kinetic equations which were very successful in describing a variety of characteristics of the polymerisation of actin and tubulin .",
    "the other limiting case , namely where seed material is added at the beginning of the reaction and where no new growth nuclei are formed during the reaction , is also well known . in this paper",
    ", we present exact results which encompass all cases between these limiting scenarios , extending the results of oosawa for a system dominated by primary nucleation to the case where an arbitrary concentration of pre - formed seed material is present .",
    "we also discuss a range of general closed form results from the oosawa theory for the behaviour of a system of biofilaments growing through primary nucleation and elongation .",
    "we then compare the behaviour of systems dominated by primary nucleation to results derived recently for systems dominated by secondary nucleation .",
    "the theoretical description of the polymerisation of proteins such as actin and tubulin to yield functional biostructures was considered in the 1960s by oosawa@xcite . for a system that evolves through primary nucleation of new filaments , elongation of existing filaments , and depolymerisation from the filament ends , the change in concentration of filaments of size @xmath0 ,",
    "denoted @xmath1 , is given by the master equation@xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are rate constants describing the elongation , depolymerisation and nucleation steps and @xmath6 is the concentration of free monomeric protein in solution .",
    "the factor of 2 in eq .   originates from the assumption of growth from both ends . for the case of irreversible biofilament growth",
    ", the polymerisation rate dominates over the depolymerisation rate ; from eq .",
    ", the rate of change of the number of filaments , @xmath7 , and the free monomer concentration , @xmath6 , were shown by oosawa under these conditions @xcite to obey : @xmath8 combining eqs .",
    "and yields a differential equation for the free monomer concentration@xcite : @xmath9 .    here ,",
    "we integrate these equations in the general case where the initial state of the system can consist of any proportion of monomeric and fibrillar material ; this calculation generalises the results presented by oosawa to include a finite concentration of seed material present at the start of the reaction . beginning with eqs .   and , the substitution @xmath10 followed by multiplication through by @xmath11 yields : @xmath12 =   \\frac{d}{dt}e^{n_c z}\\ ] ] integrating both sides results in : @xmath13 we obtain a separable equation for @xmath11 , which can be solved to yield : @xmath14 integration and exponentiation yields the expression for @xmath6 : @xmath15^{1/n_c}\\ ] ] inserting the appropriate boundary conditions in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath17 fixes the values of the constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 , resulting in the final exact result for the polymer mass concentration @xmath20 : @xmath21^{\\beta } \\label{eq : oosawaseededm}\\ ] ] where the effective rate constant @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "we note that this expression only depends on two combinations of the microscopic rate constants , @xmath28 and @xmath22 .",
    "the result reveals that @xmath22 controls the aggregation resulting from the newly formed aggregates , whereas @xmath29 defines growth from the pre - formed seed structures initially present in solution . in the special case of the aggregation reaction starting with purely soluble proteins , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ,",
    "these expressions reduce to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and eq .",
    "yields the result presented by oosawa@xcite and the single relevant parameter in the rate equations is @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , generalisations of eq .   which include secondary pathways ,",
    "maintain the dependence on @xmath22 and @xmath29 but introduce an additional parameter analogous to @xmath22 for each active secondary pathway@xcite .",
    "an expression for the evolution of the polymer number concentration , @xmath7 may be derived using eq .  .",
    "direct integration of eq .   gives the result for @xmath7 : @xmath34 eqs .   and give in closed form the time evolution of the biofilament number and mass concentration growing through primary nucleation and filament elongation .    ; a lag - phase exists when the initial gradient is not the maximal gradient .",
    "the numbers accompanying each curve are @xmath35 ; eq .   predicts that a lag - phase only exists when this ratio is less than unity .",

    "the time of maximal growth rate , @xmath43 , can be found from the inflection point of the sigmoid from the condition @xmath44 : @xmath45 ( \\mu \\beta^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\lambda_0)^{-1}\\ ] ] such that a lag phase exists only for : @xmath46 using the composition @xmath47 reduces this to the simple condition : @xmath48 in other words , a point of inflection exists if the growth through elongation from the ends of pre - existing seeds , @xmath29 , is less effective that the effective growth through nucleation and elongation of new material , @xmath22 .",
    "this result imples that an increased nucleation rate promotes the existence of an inflection point , whereas an increased elongation rate or an increased level of seeding tends to disfavour its existence . in particular",
    ", we also note that in the absence of nucleation , an inflection point can not exist in the polymer mass concentration as a function of time .",
    "interestingly , the result eq",

    ", we note that a point of inflection can never exist for @xmath7 for simple nucleated polymerisation .",

    "this behaviour can be seen to be a consequence of the fact that under many conditions , the rate equations are dominated by a single parameters that corresponds to the dominant form of nucleation : @xmath22 for classical nucleated polymerisation and @xmath58 for polymerisation in the presence of secondary pathways .",
    "these parameters have the general form @xmath59 where @xmath60 corresponds to the nucleation process and @xmath61 is related to the monomer dependence of this process : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the critical nucleus size for primary nucleation , @xmath64 for fragmentation driven growth and @xmath65 , the secondary nucleus size in cases where monomer - dependent secondary nucleation is dominant .",
    "the dominance of a single combination of the rate constants implies that many of the macroscopic system observables will be correlated since they are dependent on the same parameter .",
    "a striking examples of this behaviour is provided by the very general correlation between the lag - time and the maximal growth rate@xcite , which is manifested in the present case in eqs .   and as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "interestingly the rate equations describe sigmoidal curves both in the presence and in the absence of secondary nucleation processes . for more complex primary nucleation pathways@xcite the polynomial form for the early time solution",
    "is maintained , but higher - order exponents are obtained . in the absence of secondary processes , however , the lag - phase is less marked since the early time rise is a slower polynomial relationship rather than the exponential onset characteristic of secondary pathways@xcite .",
    "this observation implies that the difference between a high - order polynomial and an exponential may not be apparent in experimental data in the presence of noise , and therefore a global analysis of the system under different conditions is required in order to obtain robust mechanistic information@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have provided results for the time course of nucleated polymerisation for systems that are initially in a mixed state and contain both monomeric and fibrillar material .",
