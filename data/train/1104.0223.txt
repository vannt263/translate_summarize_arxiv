    "the existence of a prominent bar in the galactic bulge is now well established from multiple lines of evidence ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale kinematics of the bulge sampled by the brava ( bulge radial velocity assay ) survey @xcite can be fitted with simple cylindrical rotation and little or no classical spheroidal component @xcite , a conclusion also reached ( albeit at lower confidence ) from proper motion surveys @xcite .",
    "our ` bulge ' appears to consist of a peanut - shaped bar , reminiscent of the ` pseudobulges ' defined by @xcite and encountered elsewhere @xcite .    at the same time , this result is puzzling .",
    "the brava data imply that our galaxy has not undergone any significant merger since the epoch at which the disk formed , in contrast with expectations from simulations within @xmath4 cdm cosmological models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , it is well known that stars in the bulge are metal - rich and @xmath5-enhanced , indicating a rapid star formation history typical of classical bulges @xcite . the observation of an abundance gradient for bulge stars @xcite and a correlation between abundance and kinematics",
    "@xcite may also indicate the presence of a classical spheroidal component , although dynamical data @xcite seem to be inconsistent with this .",
    "on the other hand , detailed abundances for subgiants and lensed dwarfs , are more similar to those of the thick disk , in accordance with a pseudobulge formation scenario @xcite .",
    "adding to the complexity , the red clump in the bulge color - magnitude diagram appears doubled at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite carry out a very careful analysis of the photometric properties of the double red clump and conclude that the splitting of the red clump is due to a distance effect and that the bulge may contain an x - shaped structure , extending from the ends of the bar .",
    "so far , the only spectroscopic study of this population has been carried out by @xcite using fabry - perot imaging spectroscopy in baade s window and some adjacent fields , and their results suggest that there is a metallicity gradient with galactic latitude @xcite , as well as dynamical differences , which would be more consistent with the presence of a stream , although it is clear that more accurate kinematics and metallicities are needed to truly understand the nature of this feature .    here",
    "we present the first low resolution survey of a field at @xmath7 @xmath8 ( plaut s window ) specifically targeting the red clump stars .",
    "we analyze the kinematics and metallicity of stars belonging to each peak and derive the metallicity - kinematics trends .",
    "although this is clearly a ` first look ' exploratory analysis , our data imply that the two populations are dynamically and chemically similar and favor the x - shaped bulge hypothesis proposed by @xcite .",
    "the data for this project were kindly provided by the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama  @xcite ) .",
    "this survey is observing three 12 deg@xmath9 fields at 9h , 12h and 15h ra using the aa@xmath10 multi - fiber spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) . at the end of may , 2010 ,",
    "it was found to be impossible to reach either gama field during the last two hours of the night , at sufficiently low airmass .",
    "the survey kindly offered to observe one of the fields containing a double red clump for us .",
    "two 400-fiber configurations were observed for plaut s window ( where the two red clumps are relatively well separated and the extinction is lower ) .",
    "the target stars were selected from the 2mass survey @xcite , in a 2 degree ( diameter ) field .",
    "bulge stars were required to have @xmath11 to exclude disk contamination and to lie between @xmath12 and @xmath13 to probe the double red clump .",
    "magnitudes were dereddened from the @xcite maps .",
    "figure 1 shows the color - magnitude diagram of the target stars .",
    "the two red clumps are identified by applying a gaussian mixture modelling algorithm to the data @xcite , which also assigns to each star a probability of belonging to either peak .",
    "the magnitudes of the two red clumps peaks are in good agreement with those reported by @xcite for this region . by necessity",
    ", we used the same spectroscopic setup as employed for the gama survey ; this covers the entire optical window , from about 3700 to 9000   at a resolution of about 1500 .",
    "although this is somewhat less than optimal for determining stellar radial velocities and abundances , it suffices for our initial analysis of this field .",
    "the data were reduced using the automated pipeline supplied by aa@xmath10 . a total of 714 stars were eventually observed .",
    "the typical signal to noise ratios of these spectra are about 10 at ca h & k , 20 in the mg@xmath2 region and 50 for the calcium triplet wavelength range .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlation against stellar templates using the runz program @xcite which is specifically written for analysis of aa@xmath10 data . among the several templates available in runz we imposed the choice of a k - giant template , if this was not automatically selected by the program . of the 714 targets ,",
    "631 returned a valid radial velocity ( @xmath14 probability that the measured velocity is correct from the height of the correlation peak ) .",
    "typical velocity errors are 1/10 of a resolution element , or 25 km s@xmath15 for the @xmath16 of gama data , but no stars with a velocity error above 2@xmath17 ( 50 km s@xmath15 ) were used for our analysis .",
    "we experimented with a number of techniques to measure metal abundances , including the non - segue stellar parameters pipeline ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and the calcium triplet ( although red clump giants were outside the luminosity range of the calibrations ) .",
    "we eventually found that the most reliable measurements ( when compared with the high resolution abundances measured for giants in plaut s window by @xcite ) were given by using the mg@xmath2 lick index @xcite .",
    "we measured this index and its errors ( based on the ccd noise parameters and the radial velocity errors ) using the lector software .",
    "the typical error in measuring the mg@xmath2 index is about 5% .    in order to derive metal abundances from the mg@xmath2 index , we used fitting functions for cool stars by @xcite .",
    "we assumed @xmath18 which is appropriate for red clump giants based on the padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "temperatures were estimated from the dereddened @xmath19 color , using the @xmath20  color relations by @xcite .",
    "this approach was used by @xcite , among others , to measure the abundance of red giants in m31 , although we found that only mg@xmath2 can be reliably measured in our data .",
    "we derived metallicities for 545 stars in our data .",
    "the typical random error in metal abundance is @xmath21 dex , based on the error in the index measurement , but of course there are systematic errors depending on the assumed values of @xmath22 and @xmath20 . altering @xmath22 by 0.1 at the same temperature",
    "yields a change in [ fe / h ] of around 0.15 dex , while altering t@xmath23 by 100k yields abundance changes of 0.3 dex .",
    "in addition , our data are not on the lick system as no standards were observed , and this may introduce a systematic effect of the order of 0.2 dex in the measurement of metal abundances .",
    "we used some lick standards observed by elodie @xcite to measure mg@xmath2 and find that our abundances tend to be @xmath24 dex too low , which would bring our data in better agreement with high resolution measurements by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the known @xmath5 enhancement of the bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) means that the mg@xmath2 abundance may overestimate the actual [ fe / h ] of the stars , although it is probably a better proxy of the total metal abundance .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial velocity distribution for red clump stars derived from our data .",
    "the mean heliocentric radial velocity for the entire sample is @xmath25 km s@xmath15 ( rms ) , which is equivalent to a velocity of @xmath26 km s@xmath15 ( galactocentric standard of rest ) , consistent with data from the brava survey .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion is @xmath27 km s@xmath15 , which is somewhat larger than what is measured for this galactic latitude by brava , although we are looking at a fainter sample . the intrinsic dispersion and its error were computed following @xcite .",
    "the higher velocity dispersion seems to be due to a low metallicity population that may not be present in the brava data .",
    "stars in the first ( brighter ) peak have a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath28 km s@xmath15 and velocity dispersion of @xmath29 km s@xmath15 , while stars belonging to the second ( fainter ) red clump have mean velocity of @xmath30 km s@xmath15 and velocity dispersion of @xmath31 km s@xmath15 . within the errors , stars in both red clumps",
    "have the same mean velocity and velocity dispersion and therefore appear to have the same kinematics .",
    "this would appear to be at odds with claims for a difference in the kinematics of the two red clumps @xcite , although more sightlines are needed .",
    "application of the gaussian mixture modelling algorithm shows that there is @xmath32 chance that the velocity distribution is bimodal .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov two - sample test yields an 88% chance that the two distributions come from the same parent .",
    "the t - test and f - test show that the two distributions do not have significantly different means or variances .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution in metal abundance for stars in both clumps .",
    "the distribution for all stars has a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath33 .",
    "the distribution is consistent with that observed for red giants in baade s window by @xcite , the high resolution metallicities in plaut s window ( overplotted in the figure ) measured by @xcite and the expectations from the metallicity gradient measured by @xcite , but with a systematic offset ( @xmath24 dex ) probably due to the lack of an absolute calibration based on lick standards .",
    "stars in the first peak have mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath34 with a dispersion of @xmath35 , while stars in the second peak have mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath36 with a dispersion of @xmath37 .",
    "again , the gaussian mixture modeling algorithm returns a distribution consistent with a unimodal distribution . within the errors , stars belonging to each red clump have the same [ fe / h ] abundances .",
    "a k - s test gives a 73% probability for the two clumps to be drawn from the same distribution .",
    "similarly , the t - test and f - test show that two samples do not have significantly different means or variances .",
    "one aim in this work is to compare the kinematics and metallicities of stars belonging to the two red clumps identified in the galactic bulge by @xcite .",
    "our data show that the two populations have the same kinematics and metal abundance , which suggests that the difference in luminosity between the two red clumps is a distance effect . in other words ,",
    "the two red clumps are observed at the two ends of the @xmath38 kpc bar that constitutes the bulge of the milky way .",
    "these data are therefore consistent with the analysis by @xcite , attributing the double red clump to the existence of x - shaped protrusions at the end of the milky way bar ( i.e. , an x - shaped bulge ) .",
    "if these stars lie at the end of a bar , then the metal abundance gradient across the structure is expected to be quite small .",
    "an alternate possibility is that the two red clumps are different in helium content .",
    "helium abundance variations are believed to exist ( from indirect evidence ) in massive globular clusters in our galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "helium enhancement would produce differences in the luminosity of the red clump stars @xcite , but any process capable of producing the necessary helium enhancement would also overproduce metals .",
    "we would presume that populations with different chemical abundances might also have different kinematics .",
    "classical bulges present a number of abundance trends with kinematics , some of which are also observed in the galactic bulge . @xcite",
    "have measured a metallicity gradient with radius .",
    "@xcite find a trend between metal abundance and velocity dispersion in baade s window and two lower ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) galactic latitude fields , arguing for a two component bulge , with a metal - rich system comprising the bar and a metal - poor spheroid or thick disk , the relative contribution from each of these varying with galactic latitude .",
    "we plot the mean velocity ( lower panel ) and velocity dispersion ( upper panel ) as a function of metallicity in figure 4 .",
    "we plot all stars ( black points ) , stars in the first ( brighter ) peak ( red points ) and stars in the second ( fainter ) peak ( green points ) separately .",
    "stars in each group are binned in bins containing the same number of stars after sorting by metal abundance . for each of the groups we consider ( all , stars in the brighter and fainter peaks ) the bins span a non - overlapping range in metal abundance .",
    "stars in both red clumps appear to obey the same relations between metallicity and kinematics .",
    "this confirms that the two populations do not differ in kinematic properties or abundances , which is more consistent with a projection effect and an x - shaped bulge structure .",
    "the data shown in figure 4 show a clear trend for increasing velocity dispersion with decreasing metal abundance .",
    "this is similar to what is found by @xcite in their higher resolution data .",
    "@xcite uses two fields at @xmath39 and @xmath41 and although there are few stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath42 in their data , there is a hint of an increase in the velocity dispersion at lower metal abundances , in agreement with our observations .",
    "@xcite find a flat distribution of metallicity with velocity dispersion ( from proper motion data ) for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath43 , which is not in disagreement with our observations , where most of the increase in velocity dispersion takes place for lower metallicity stars",
    ".    for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath44 the velocity dispersion is in good agreement with that measured for brava m giants and does not depend strongly on metal abundance , which is broad agreement with what measured by @xcite in plaut s window and the two lower galactic latitude fields in @xcite .",
    "however , at [ fe / h ] @xmath3 there appears to be a ( at face value ) smooth transition to a dynamically hot component .",
    "similarly , in the upper panel of figure 4 we see that the metal - rich component appears to have significant mean heliocentric velocity , while at [ fe / h ] @xmath42 one observes a smooth trend towards a relatively static velocity component .",
    "one caveat in this is that the metallicity errors are large , and we can not rule our a bimodal distribution with the ` wings ' of the errors simulating a smoother transition between the two behaviors , although this would require a correlation between metallicity errors , measured radial velocity and velocity dispersion .    the metal rich stars are best interpreted as part of the bar / bulge structure .",
    "their kinematics show evidence of rotational support and bulk rotation and are consistent with data from the brava survey in this region .",
    "the behavior of the more metal poor component , showing high velocity dispersion , and low to zero velocity relative to the sun may be explained by a classical bulge or by inner halo stars . with a mean metal abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath45 these stars appear to be best interpreted ( at least provisionally ) as an inner halo population , although bulges can of course be metal poor as well .",
    "this is consistent with the observations by @xcite and @xcite , albeit for a single sightline .",
    "however , the brava data show no classical bulge component fitting their dynamical model @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that by selecting m giants and using the calcium triplet as their main radial velocity indicator , brava may be biased against lower metallicity stars and therefore preferentially miss the high @xmath17 component .",
    "the properties of galactic globular clusters present an interesting analogy with what is observed here : metal rich clusters , with mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath46 are believed to be associated with the bulge and are supported at least in part by rotation , whereas inner halo clusters have mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath47 their kinematics are dominated by random motions and at most very slow rotation .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the two components we see in our data are analogous to the metal - poor and metal - rich globular clusters , whose properties they appear to share to some extent ( cf .",
    ", @xcite for a similar two - component model for the bulge ) . @xcite and @xcite have argued , on the basis of isochrone fits to bulge globular clusters and field stars , that the bulge formed nearly coevally with the halo .",
    "most globular clusters in the inner halo formed within @xmath48 gyr of each other @xcite .",
    "if this applies to bulge stars as well , it would imply a rapid star formation process , at least for the inner regions ( @xmath49 kpc ) of the milky way    if this is the case , the smooth transition between the metal - rich and metal - poor subsystems , with a ` turn - over ' point at [ fe / h ] @xmath50 may imply that the bulge and halo components are continuous and that there is no clear dichotomy between the two ( modulo the large errors in metal abundance )",
    ". this would be consistent with the brava result that the bulge was formed ( in a dynamical sense ) from secular evolution at high redshift .",
    "as long as the stars also formed rapidly , the observed @xmath5-element enhancements are not in disagreement with this hypothesis .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center/ california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
