    "the alpha - cluster model , proposed by gamov in 1929 , soon was developed by the idea that nucleus behaves as a liquid drop . the nuclear liquid drop model was explicitly formulated by weizscker s formula in 1935 [ 1 ] for calculation of the binding energy .",
    "later the model had been developed by taking into account rotation deformation modes and quantum oscillations .",
    "it was shown that the large body of data on @xmath0-decay is described by a simple cluster model with using a notion of @xmath0-core potential [ 2 ] .",
    "there are also some approaches considering some regular forms alpha clusters might build [ 3 ] .",
    "there are several attempts to incorporate the alpha cluster model into the shell model [ 3,4 ] .",
    "currently the idea of alpha - clustering is actively used in the microscopic studies of the nuclear structure of the light nuclei [ 5 - 7 ] in the framework of the few - body task , as well as in studies of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction [ 8 ] .",
    "there has been also some activity recently to apply an alpha - cluster model to facilitate the description of some characteristics of nuclei like the @xmath0-particle separation energy [ 9 ] or nuclear radii [ 10 ] for wide range of nuclei .",
    "it is well known that the experimental charge radii are well described as depending on the mass number due to the formula @xmath1 fm .",
    "the value of @xmath2 varies within @xmath3 from the light nuclei to the heavy ones . for the stable nuclei with @xmath4 the average value of @xmath5 fm obtained from fitting the experimental values of the radii of the most abundant isotopes [ 10 ]",
    "gives a root mean square deviation @xmath6 of the calculated values of @xmath7 from the experimental values known with an average error @xmath8 fm . at the same time",
    "the calculations show that the radii can be described even with a less deviation @xmath9 by another formula , @xmath10 fm .",
    "therefore the number of protons , or one can say the number of @xmath0-clusters @xmath11 , can be considered as being responsible for charge radii disregarding to the number of excess neutrons .    in this connection",
    "it is interesting to modify the classic alpha cluster model in accordance with the idea suggesting that @xmath0-clusters are the ruling elements of the nuclear structure .",
    "this work is devoted to the task of obtaining some phenomenological formulas to calculate the radii and the binding energies of nuclei in dependence on the number of alpha - clusters and their inter - cluster bonds . unlike the weizscker s formula",
    ", the binding energy of excess neutrons is to be estimated separately .    in the @xmath0-cluster model presented in the work a nucleus",
    "is supposed to consist of a number of proton - neutron pairs , @xmath12-pairs , that are coupled into alpha - clusters [ 11 ] . in case of an odd value of @xmath13",
    "there is one @xmath12-pair on the surface of an alpha - clustered nucleus .",
    "the idea that the last proton and the last neutron in the nucleus with an odd value of z form a @xmath12-pair on the surface of alpha - cluster drop can be supported by the fact that the total spin of the nuclei with @xmath14 in their ground states is equal to the doubled value of the single - particle momentum of the last nucleon .",
    "this gives definite evidence for the existence of strong correlation between the last proton and neutron .",
    "a particular feature of the model is an assumption that the proton and the neutron belonging to one pair have equivalent nuclear single - particle bound state potentials ( the epn requirement [ 12,13 ] ) , which looks reasonable from the point of view of the isotopic invariance of nuclear force . as a result",
    ", this assumption brings about a definition of the difference @xmath15 of the single - particle binding energies for the proton and the neutron of one pair as the coulomb energy of the proton in field of the nucleus .",
    "it can help in estimation of the radius of the last proton position in the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear charge radii are calculated by means of a sum of the square radii of the core and the peripheral @xmath0-clusters weighted by the numbers of clusters in the core and the number of clusters on the nucleus periphery .",
    "this calculational procedure is similar to that usually used in the framework of single - particle potential approaches assumed in shell model [ 10,14 ] .",
    "it has been found [ 15 ] from analysis of nuclei with the equal numbers of protons and neutrons , @xmath14 , that the number of short - range bonds between @xmath11 alpha - clusters is calculated by the formula @xmath16 .",
    "a good agreement between experimental binding energies of the nuclei with @xmath14 and the values of energies calculated with taking into account only the short - range bonds allows one to suggest that that portion of the coulomb energy which comes from the long - range interactions is compensated by the surface tension energy .",
    "this suggests a formula for calculation of the surface tension energy .",
    "thus , on the basis of this model the formulas to calculate the coulomb energy @xmath17 , the nuclear force energy @xmath18 and the surface tension energy @xmath19 of the alpha - cluster nuclear matter have been derived in a consistent way .",
    "it is suggested that the binding energy of excess neutrons for the nuclei with @xmath20 can be calculated by means of a sum of the binding energies of excess neutron - neutron pairs , @xmath21-pairs , as @xmath22 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath23 are approximated by a phenomenological formula in dependence on the number of pairs @xmath24 with using two parameters . in previous work [ 11 ] the experimental values of @xmath23 were used to calculate the nuclear binding energies .    as a result",
    ", the formulas do not contain fitting parameters .",
    "all the quantities used have their own physical meaning .",
    "they are obtained from an independent analysis of such values as @xmath15 , the binding energy of the lightest nuclei or by fitting the experimental binding energies of the excess @xmath21-pairs .    to test the validity of the formulas for calculation of @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 independently of the binding energy of the excess neutrons , the @xmath0-particle separation energy , as well as the deuteron separation energy ,",
    "have been calculated .",
    "agreement between the calculated values and experimental ones has been shown .",
    "a picture given in fig . 1 shows the @xmath12-pair bonds in the nuclei .    the internal binding energy of one cluster is taken equal to that of nucleus @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the distance between clusters is supposed to be constant for all nuclei except nucleus @xmath28 . in the case one",
    "binding is not enough to keep two positively charged clusters close .",
    "adding one more @xmath12-pair causes two new bindings with the pairs of two alpha - clusters with the energy @xmath29 in the nucleus @xmath30 , and the clusters get closer with the distance proper for the alpha - cluster liquid .",
    "the energy of adherence of two clusters @xmath31 is estimated by means of the following equations[11,15 ] for the binding energy @xmath32 of the lightest nuclei    @xmath33    so the values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the energy between the single @xmath12-pair and a @xmath12-pair of the nearby @xmath0-cluster , @xmath38 stands for the binding energy of the proton and the neutron in the single pair .",
    "the binding energy of the other nuclei including @xmath39 are calculated with a good accuracy by means of the following equations for the nuclei with even @xmath13 with mass number @xmath40 @xmath41 and for the nuclei with odd @xmath42 and the mass number @xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath11 denotes the number of alpha - clusters , @xmath16 stands for the number of inter - cluster bonds .",
    "although the idea that every new added cluster causes three new bonds with three other clusters of its close vicinity was discussed before [ 3 ] , the formula to calculate the number of bonds was first obtained in [ 15 ] .",
    "( 1 ) implies that binding energy of a nucleus @xmath40 is determined by the number of clusters and the number of bonds .",
    "the energy of a nucleus @xmath45 is determined by the energy of the nucleus @xmath40 plus the energy of six bonds between the single pair and six pairs of the three clusters which get bound with that pair plus the binding energy of the pair itself .",
    "the values of @xmath32 are presented in table 1 in comparison with experimental values @xmath46 [ 16 ] .",
    "charge radii and binding energies for nuclei with @xmath25 .",
    "radii are given in fm , energies in mev .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * the value is calculated by weizscker s formula ( 6 )    one can see from this table that the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are comparable . to test the formulas for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath49 independently of the energy of excess neutrons ,",
    "the energy of the alpha - particle separation energy , as well as the deutron separation energy , have been calculated . in the table",
    "the experimental values @xmath50 and @xmath51 are followed by the calculated values @xmath52 .",
    "the left part of the table contains values for nuclids of the most abundant isotopes for even @xmath13 or nearest to them for odd @xmath53 .",
    "the right part contains the values of binding energies for the isotopes with large and small number of @xmath54 . since for the nuclei with @xmath55 the experimental values of the energy of excess neutrons ( 24 )",
    "is used , the values of @xmath47 in the cases with a larger number of neutrons are the same as for nuclei with @xmath14 .",
    "there are two specific assumptions in the alpha - cluster model presented here .",
    "namely , ( 1 ) the @xmath12-pair interactions are responsible for building alpha - clusters and their adherence and ( 2 ) the proton and the neutron from a pair have equivalent bound state nuclear potentials . formulas to calculate the radii and binding energies of nuclei have been obtained in the framework of the model .",
    "the deviation of the calculated radii from the experimental values is @xmath56 fm , which is @xmath57 of the magnitude of radius .",
    "the calculated values of binding energies of the nuclei with an integer number of @xmath12-pairs and @xmath21-pairs have deviations from the experimental values comparable with the values due to weizscker s formula and they have less than @xmath58 on average .",
    "the calculations do not take into account the spin - orbit correlations and consequently shell effects stay beyond this consideration .",
    "therefore , the accuracy obtained for the calculated values may provide some evidence on the influence of the shell effects on the values of the charge radii and binding energies for the nuclei in their ground states . the accuracy of several hundredths of fm for the radius and of several mev for the binding energy reveal the possible range of the shell effect influence .",
    "it is in an agreement with the range of applicability of shell model in the various tasks of nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "the obtained values of the coulomb repulsion and the nuclear force energies of the cluster - cluster interaction , which are 1.925 mev and 4.350 mev correspondingly , can be useful in a microscopic description of light nuclei @xmath39 and @xmath59 in the framework of the few - body task .",
    "the obtained formulas to calculate the coulomb radius @xmath60 , the charge radius @xmath7 and the radius of the last proton position @xmath61 by the number of @xmath0-clusters show that for light nuclei @xmath62 and for heavy nuclei @xmath63 .",
    "the empirical values of the coulomb energy @xmath17 for the nuclei with @xmath14 have been obtained .",
    "these values together with the empirical values of the short - range nuclear force energy , @xmath64 , can be useful in studying the heavy - ion induced reactions such as fusion or fission reactions .",
