    "recently , uge@xmath0  @xcite , urhge  @xcite , and ucoge  @xcite were discovered to exhibit ferromagnetic superconductivity .",
    "experimental results suggest that the same electrons are contributing to both ferromagnetism and superconductivity , and thus , in the superconducting phase of these materials , the electrons are considered to condensate into a spin - triplet pair state unlike usual low temperature superconductors , in which electrons are forming non - magnetic spin - singlet pairs .",
    "microscopic explanation of this phenomenon is a challenge in condensed matter physics , but the problem is rather subtle and difficult since we have to treat spin - rotation symmetry breaking and electron - pair condensation simultaneously .",
    "in fact , the mechanism for ferromagnetism alone in itinerant electron systems has not yet been fully understood , although there have been some rigorous developments  @xcite in the hubbard model , which is one of the simplest models of itinerant electron systems . as for electron - pair condensation",
    ", some models have been shown to have pairing ground states  @xcite , but little is known about spin - triplet pairing ground states .",
    "the coulomb repulsion between electrons combined with the pauli exclusion principle can generate ferromagnetism in itinerant electron systems  @xcite , but it is unclear at the present time that the same can also lead to ferromagnetic superconductivity . since the electrons form spin - triplet pairs , it is expected that there appears a kind of effective ferromagnetic interaction between electrons in the ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "thus a model containing ferromagnetic interactions as well as the coulomb repulsion between electrons will be suitable for an investigation as a first step toward understanding microscopic mechanisms for ferromagnetic superconductivity .    in this paper",
    "we propose a model which has fullypolarized ferromagnetic pairing ground states .",
    "the model consists of the electron hopping term , the on - site coulomb repulsion and a short - range ferromagnetic interaction term .",
    "it is possible to consider the model in any dimension , but for simplicity we mainly concentrate on a one - dimensional version here . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "our model is defined on two chains .",
    "the electrons can hop along the chain direction , feeling on - site repulsion , and furthermore the two electrons , one on a bond in a chain and the other on a site in the other chain , feel a ferromagnetic interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) .",
    "it is shown in our model that , owing to the ferromagnetic interaction introduced here , the electrons form spin - triplet pairs , and then the fullypolarized ferromagnetic pairing state is selected by the on - site coulomb repulsion as the unique ground state ( up to degeneracy due to spin - rotation symmetry ) .",
    "it is also shown that the ground state exhibits off - diagonal long - range order associated with local spin - triplet pairs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we set up the model and state the main results . in section  [",
    "s : proof ] we prove the main results . in section  [ s : remarks ] we make some remarks on our model and ferromagnetic pairing states .",
    "we also present models with anisotropic spin - interactions and show that the models exhibit other kinds of spin-1 electron - pair condensation . in the final section we briefly comment on the higher dimensional version of the model .",

    "since the set of all vectors @xmath21 is not orthonormal , the @xmath22-operators do not satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations ( in fact , it is easy to see that @xmath23 if @xmath24 ) , so that we introduce dual operators @xmath25 as follows .",
