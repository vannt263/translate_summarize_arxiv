    "perhaps the greatest advance in particle physics over the past decade has been the discovery of neutrino mass and mixing involving two large mixing angles commonly known as the atmospheric angle @xmath0 and the solar angle @xmath1 .",
    "the latest data from neutrino oscillation experiments is consistent with the so called tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing pattern @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the diagonal phase matrix involving the two observable majorana phases , and there were many attempts to reproduce this as a theoretical prediction @xcite .",
    "since the forthcoming neutrino experiments will be sensitive to small deviations from tb mixing , it is important to study the theoretical uncertainty in such tb mixing predictions .",
    "the question of how to achieve tm mixing has been the subject of intense theoretical speculation . in theoretical models",
    "one attempts to construct the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices in some particular basis .",
    "there are two particular bases that have been used widely in the literature for this purpose , as follows .",
    "the first basis is the flavour basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , while the neutrino mass matrix takes a particular form such that is results in tb mixing .",
    "the second basis is a particular basis first introduced by cabibbo and wolfenstein in which both the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices are non - diagonal , but in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalised by a `` democratic unitary matrix '' involving elements of equal magnitude but differing by a phase @xmath4 .",
    "such a cabibbo - wolfenstein basis is particularly well suited to models of tb mixing based on the discrete group @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however in other classes of models , one attempts to work in the flavour basis and to derive tb mixing purely from the neutrino sector with the charged lepton matrix being diagonal , for example using constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) @xcite .",
    "however , when attempting to derive tb mixing in the flavour basis in realistic models arising from grand unified theories ( guts ) , it is observed that , although tb mixing may be accurately achieved from neutrino mixing , in practice the flavour basis is never accurately achieved , i.e. the charged lepton mass matrix is never accurately diagonal . instead , in such gut models , the charged lepton mass matrix often resembles the down quark mass matrix , and involves an additional cabibbo - like rotation in order to diagonalize it . in such models , then , tb mixing arises in the neutrino sector , but with charged lepton correction giving deviations @xcite .",
    "it turns out that such cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections lead to well defined corrections to tb mixing which can be cast in the form of sum rules expressed in terms of the measurable pmns parameters .",
    "one example is the neutrino mixing sum rule @xmath6@xcite , where @xmath7 is the observable dirac cp phase in the standard parameterisation . since",
    "such sum rules may be tested in future high precision long baseline neutrino experiments , it is of interest to know with what precision they are expected to hold theoretically .",
    "such sum rules as discussed above are strictly only expected to apply at some high energy scale , whereas the neutrino experiments are performed at low energy scales . in order to compare the predictions of such sum rules to experiment",
    "one must therefore perform a renormalisation group ( rg ) running from the high energy ( e.g. the grand unified theory ( gut ) ) scale where the theory is defined to the electroweak scale @xmath8 .",
    "rg corrections arise mainly from the large tau lepton and third family neutrino yukawa couplings , and this leads to large wavefunction corrections in the framework of supersymmetric models .",
    "the running of neutrino masses and lepton mixing angles is very important and has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a mathematica package reap ( http://www.ph.tum.de/  rge/ ) which solves rges and provides numerical values for the neutrino mass matrix and mixing angles was developed .    in this paper",
    "we provide a first numerical study of the deviations from tb mixing due to the effects of both charged lepton corrections and rg running .",
    "we focus on gut inspired models in which the charged lepton corrections are cabibbo - like and in this case they may be cast in terms of sum rules valid at the gut scale . in practice , then , we are interested in the rg corrections to these sum rules which may subsequently be reliably compared to experiment at low energies",
    ". we shall study a variety of neutrino mixing sum rules ( arising from the deviations from exact tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing due to cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections ) and comment on their accuracy and reliability when comparing them to future low energy neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "most of the specific numerical results are inspired by a particular class of gut - flavour models , namely the models in @xcite , which are precisely the type of models in which the sum rules emerge in the first place . in the cases",
    "studied we find rather small corrections .",
    "for example the sum rule @xmath9 becomes renormalized by about @xmath10 for large @xmath11 .",
    "although most of the numerical results are based on a particular gut motivated model , we also analyze a completely different type of model and find qualitatively similar results .",
    "this suggests that our results will apply to more general models based on the minimal supersymmetric standard model , extended to include the see - saw mechanism , with hierarchical neutrino masses .",
    "we emphasize that in this paper we only consider deviations from tb lepton mixing due to the combination of charged lepton corrections and rg running , and that in general there will be other sources of deviations that we do not consider .",
    "for example , exact csd @xcite itself will lead to some deviations since it does not predict precisely tb neutrino mixing due to corrections of order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another example of deviations to tb mixing are the canonical normalization effects discussed in @xcite .",
    "clearly such additional corrections are quite model dependent and a phenomenological study of corrections to the tb mixing in the neutrino sector , in the flavour basis , has been made in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall simply assume precise tb neutrino mixing at the gut scale , and investigate the deviations due to charged lepton corrections and rg running only , ignoring other possible model dependent corrections .",
    "the rg corrections to tb mixing ( but not charged lepton corrections or the resulting sum rules ) were also considered in @xcite .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give our conventions , including the tb deviation parameters that we will use . in section 3 we discuss the see - saw mechanism and show how tb neutrino mixing can be achieved . in section 4",
    "we show how cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections leads to neutrino mixing sum rules .",
    "we also present a numerical model of tb neutrino mixing adapted from a well motivated example of light sequential dominance used in the gut flavour models of @xcite that we shall use in most of the remainder of the paper .",
    "we also show how sensitive these results are to non - cabibbo like charged lepton corrections . in section 5",
    "we numerically study the rg corrections to the various neutrino mixing sum rules which embody the charged lepton corrections to tb neutrino mixing . in section 6 we explore a second type of numerical model adapted from heavy sequential dominance @xcite and show that the results are qualitatively similar to the case of the first numerical model .",
    "section 7 concludes the paper .",
    "the mixing matrix in the lepton sector , the pmns matrix @xmath13 , is defined as the matrix appearing in the electroweak coupling to the @xmath14 bosons expressed in terms of lepton mass eigenstates .",
    "the lagrangian is given in terms of mass matrices of charged leptons @xmath15 and neutrinos @xmath16 as , @xmath17    the change in basis from flavour to eigenbasis is performed by , @xmath18 the pmns matrix is then given by , @xmath19    in the standard pdg parametrization , the pmns matrix can be written as ,    @xmath20    where @xmath7 is the dirac cp violating phase , and @xmath21 contains the majorana phases @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "@xmath32    global fits of the conventional mixing angles @xcite can be translated into the ranges , @xmath33    considering an expansion of the lepton mixing matrix in powers of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath34 about the tri - bimaximal form .",
    "one gets the following form for the mixing matrix to first order in @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath34 @xcite ,    @xmath35      for later convenience , we also define the following parameters which express the deviation of the magnitude of the third row mixing matrix elements from their tri - bimaximal values : @xmath36 , @xmath37    we can also express the @xmath38 parameters in terms of the deviation parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath34 from eq.[dev]as follows , @xmath39",
    "the see - saw mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses . before discussing its simplest form , we first start by summarising the possible types of neutrino mass .",
    "one type is majorana masses of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a left - handed neutrino field and @xmath42 is the cp conjugate of a left- handed neutrino field , in other words a right handed antineutrino field @xcite . introducing right - handed neutrino fields , other neutrino mass terms are possible .",
    "there are additional majorana masses of the form @xmath43 and dirac masses of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a right - handed neutrino field and @xmath46 is its cp conjugate .",
    "the majorana masses of the form @xmath47are strictly forbidden in the standard model , assuming only the higgs doublets are present .",
    "the reason for this is that heavy left - handed neutrinos would disturb the theory of weak interactions with w , z bosons . for the simplest version of the see - saw mechanism",
    ", one can assume that the left - handed majorana masses are zero at first , but are effectively generated after introducing the right handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the right - handed neutrino does not take part in weak interactions with the w , z bosons , and so its mass @xmath48 can be arbitrarily large . with these types of neutrino mass ,",
    "the see - saw mass matrix is given as , @xmath49    in the approximation that @xmath50 ( @xmath48 may be orders of magnitude larger than the electroweak scale ) , the matrix in eq.[m ] can be diagonalised to give the effective left - handed majorana masses , @xmath51    these masses are naturally suppressed by the heavy scale @xmath48 .",
    "taking @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we find @xmath54 which is good for solar neutrinos . a right - handed neutrino with a mass below the gut scale would be required for atmospheric neutrinos .    the fundamental parameters which must be inputted into the see - saw mechanism are the dirac mass matrix @xmath55 and the heavy right - handed neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath48 .",
    "the output is the effective left - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath56 as given by the see - saw formula in eq.[see ] @xcite .",
    "the see - saw mechanism discussed so far is the simplest version and it is sometimes called type i see - saw mechanism . in pati - salam models or grand unified theories based on @xmath57 , type",
    "i is generalised to type ii see - saw , where an additional term for the light neutrinos is present @xcite",
    ".      sequential dominance ( sd ) is an elegant way of accounting for a neutrino mass hierarchy with large atmospheric and solar mixing angles @xcite .",
    "here we review how tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing can result from constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) @xcite . in sd , the atmospheric and solar neutrino",
    "mixing angles are obtained in terms of ratios of yukawa couplings involving the dominant and subdominant right - handed neutrinos , respectively . to understand how tri- bimaximal neutrino mixing could emerge from sd , we begin by writing the right- handed neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath48 in a diagonal basis as , @xmath58 without loss of generality write the neutrino ( dirac ) yukawa matrix @xmath59 in terms of the complex yukawa couplings a , b , c , d , e , f , a,b,c",
    "as @xmath60    for simplicity we assume that @xmath61 .",
    "sd then corresponds to the right - handed neutrino of mass @xmath62 being the dominant term while the right- handed neutrino of mass @xmath63 giving the leading sub - dominant contribution to the see - saw mechanism .",
    "@xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and all yukawa couplings are assumed to be complex .",
    "light sequential dominance corresponds to @xmath67    tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , in which @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 corresponds to the choice , @xmath71 this corresponds to constrained sequential dominance ( csd)@xcite . note that the analytic results for sd and csd are accurate to leading order in @xmath12 @xcite , so these conditions will not give rise precisely to tb neutrino mixing , and so in the numerical studies we shall need to perturb the csd relations in order to achieve accurate tb neutrino mixing at the gut scale , as discussed later .",
    "in this paper we shall consider the case that tb mixing ( eq.[tbm ] ) applies quite accurately only to the _ neutrino mixing _ in some basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is not exactly diagonal @xcite .",
    "this is a situation often encountered in realistic models @xcite .",
    "furthermore in gut models it is often the case that , in the basis where the neutrino mixing is of the tb form , the charged lepton mixing matrix has a cabibbo - like structure rather similar to the quark mixing and is dominated by a 1 - 2 mixing @xmath72 @xcite , @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is a phase required for the diagonalisation of the charged lepton mass matrix @xcite .",
    "the physical pmns oscillation phase @xmath7 turns out to be related to @xmath77 by @xcite , @xmath78 in this paper we assume that the neutrino mixing is accurately of the tb form , @xmath79 the physical mixing matrix is given by eq.[pmns ] using eq.[tbmnu ] and eq.[cl ] .",
    "the standard pdg form of the pmns mixing matrix in eq.[mns ] requires real elements @xmath80 and @xmath81 and this may be achieved by use of the phases in @xmath21 .",
    "it follows that @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are unaffected by the cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections and are hence given by : @xmath85 , [ sumtt ] , [ sumh ] may be expressed in terms of the third family matrix element deviation parameters defined in eq.[xi1 ] as simply : @xmath86    since these relations are all on the same footing , it is sufficient to discuss one of them only and in the following we choose to focus on eq .",
    "[ sum ] . from eq.[mns ] , eq .",
    "[ sum ] may be expanded in terms of the standard mixing angles and phase leading to the so called mixing sum rules as follows : @xmath87 where we have assumed @xmath88 .",
    "this sum rule can be simplified further to leading order in @xmath89 , @xmath90 from eq.[sumh ] @xmath91 , hence to leading order , @xmath92 the last form of the sum rule was first presented in @xcite , while all the forms can be found in @xcite .",
    "we shall later study all three forms of the sum rules @xmath93 , together with some related sum rules which we now discuss .    using the parametrization in eq.[de ] , the sum rule in eq.[gamma3 ]",
    "can be expressed in terms of the deviation parameters @xmath30 , @xmath29 and the dirac cp phase ( @xmath7)@xcite , @xmath94 to deal with issues of canonical normalisation corrections , the following sum rule has been proposed @xcite , @xmath95 this sum rule was claimed to be stable under leading logarithmic third family rg corrections , although , as emphasized in @xcite , it does not include the effect of the running of @xmath27 or @xmath29 , whose inclusion introduces a majorana phase dependence . , and the running of @xmath29 was neglected because it is suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath12 compared to the running of @xmath30 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "such effects will be studied numerically later .      in order to study the rg corrections and reliability of the various sum rules numerically",
    "it is necessary to define the gut scale matrices rather specifically . in most of this paper",
    "we shall consider a numerical example inspired by the gut - flavour models of @xcite , although in section 6 another numerical model will be considered leading to qualitatively similar results .",
    "therefore in most of the remainder of this paper we shall take the right - handed neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath48 to be the diagonal matrix : @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "this is an example with light sequential dominance where the lightest right handed neutrino is dominant @xcite . ignoring rge corrections to begin with",
    ", we find that precise tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) can be achieved with the yukawa matrix : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these parameters also lead to the following values for the neutrino masses : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the low energy pole masses of the quarks are given as follows : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in order to satisfy these values at low energy scale , reap was used to perform the running of these masses from the @xmath116 scale to the gut scale and the resulting quark yukawa matrices @xmath117 and @xmath118 at the gut scale were taken as initial conditions for the running of the neutrino mixing parameters and sum rules from the gut scale to @xmath116 scale .",
    "the above parameter choice approximately satisfies the csd conditions in eq.[csd ] .",
    "however small corrections are used in order to achieve tbm neutrino mixing angles to 2 decimal places .",
    "if the csd conditions were imposed exactly we would find instead @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 which are close to , but not accurately equal to , the tbm values .",
    "this is to be expected since the sd relations are only accurate to leading order in @xmath12 @xcite . since in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying the deviations from exact tb neutrino mixing due to charged lepton corrections and rg running we shall assume the matrices in eq.[cor ] rather than the csd conditions as the starting point for our analysis .    in order to study the effect of",
    "cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections on the physical mixing angles where the neutrino mixing is precisely tri - bimaximal , we shall use the reap package previously discussed . in order to use the reap package it is convenient to work in the basis where the charged lepton yukawa matrix is diagonal .",
    "thus , assuming charged lepton corrections of the form of eq.[cl ] , the neutrino yukawa matrix in the non - diagonal charged lepton basis must be transformed to the diagonal charged lepton basis according to : @xmath123 hence the original neutrino yukawa matrix in eq.[cor ] must be rotated to the diagonal charged lepton basis according to eq.[rot ] .    including the cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections , physical tri - bimaximal mixing only holds when @xmath124 .",
    "however according to the sum rules for @xmath93 , certain combinatioms of mixing parameters sum to @xmath125 for all values of the cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections .",
    "this is illustrated in tables.[tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] where the values of the mixing angles together with the dirac phase and the sum rules @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 at the gut scale are presented for different values of @xmath72 and @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath126 was found to be the most accurate sum rule at the gut scale with a value of @xmath125 exactly at all values of @xmath129 and @xmath77 .",
    "however the error in all the sum rules is less than about @xmath130 in all the examples considered .",
    ".values of the neutrino mixing angles @xmath1 , @xmath27 and @xmath131 together with @xmath7 and the sum rules @xmath126 , @xmath132 and @xmath128 at the gut scale , at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "all the angles are in degrees . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to compare the analytic results to the numerical results in table  [ tab7 ] for the neutrino mixing angles at the @xmath116 scale , assuming that they take the precise tb mixing values at the gut scale and setting all charged lepton corrections to zero , for the lsd model described above .",
    "the results show that the numerical estimate of @xmath135 ( which is equal to zero at the gut scale ) is very accurately reproduced by the analytic approximation ( indeed there is no difference to 2 d.p . ) , and the rg correction to @xmath136 is also well reproduced with the analytic estimate underestimating the correction by only @xmath137 degrees .",
    "however the results also show that there is a significant underestimate of @xmath138 with the analytically estimated value at the @xmath116 scale being less than the numerical value by about @xmath139 degrees , resulting in the analytically estimated values for @xmath126 and @xmath127 being less than the numerical values by about the same amount ( @xmath140 ) . from the point of view of the effects studied in this paper ( for example note the precision of the scales shown in the results in figure  [ fig : sum ] ) an error of @xmath139 degrees is undesirable and we would not wish to compromise the results in this paper by being subject to such unnecessary errors incurred by the analytic approach .",
    "finally we remark that the origin of the discrepancy between the analytic estimates and the numerical results , for the cases where the analytic approach is reliable and applicable , is due to the fact that the analytic estimates are based on the assumption that the yukawa couplings @xmath141 and @xmath142 are fixed at their gut scale values and do not run , whereas the numerical results allow for the co - running of all the yukawa couplings in the matrix ( including the second family yukawa couplings ) , with the leading logs being effectively re - summed .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the effects of charged lepton corrections and rg running on the low energy predictions of theories which accurately predict tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing at the high energy scale . in gut motivated examples the charged lepton corrections are often cabibbo - like and in this case",
    "the effect of charged lepton corrections leads to a range of neutrino mixing sum rules at the gut scale , given by the @xmath93 sum rules in eqs.[sm],[su],[gamma3 ] , as well as the @xmath143 sum rules expressed in terms of the deviation parameters in eqs.[sd1 ] and [ sd2 ] .",
    "we have studied the rg running of such sum rules numerically for a specific numerical example inspired by the gut models in @xcite , corresponding closely to csd with lsd .",
    "our results indicate small but measurable effects for the two examples studied .",
    "for example the @xmath128 sum rule arising from cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections ( due to @xmath72 corrections ) which at the gut scale corresponds to @xmath9 becomes renormalized by about @xmath10 even for large @xmath11 .",
    "we have also considered the effect on charged lepton corrections coming from non - cabibbo - like charged lepton corrections ( due to non - zero @xmath144 ) and confirmed that the sum rule @xmath145 is insensitive to @xmath144 .    even for a particular class of numerical model , such as the gut - flavour inspired lsd model considered",
    ", the numerical results will depend in general on the choice of majorana phases for that model .",
    "we have seen that switching on these majorana phases can alter significantly the running of the tb mixing deviation parameters @xmath146 as well as the sum rules such as @xmath143 .",
    "for example the sum rule @xmath147 which includes the leading logarithmic rg corrections due to the running of @xmath30 and @xmath34 , will have a majorana phase dependence via the running of @xmath29 which was neglected in the derivation of @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "thus , the relative stability of @xmath147 as compared to @xmath145 turns out to be a majorana phase dependent question .",
    "although most of the numerical results are based on a particular gut - flavour motivated lsd type of model , we have also considered similar results for a completely different type of model based on hsd .",
    "overall we have found that the rg running effects are quite small in both cases which suggests that qualitatively similar results will apply to other models based on the minimal supersymmetric standard model , extended to include the see - saw mechanism , with hierarchical neutrino masses .",
    "however , we repeat our caveat in the introduction that in this paper we have only considered deviations from tb lepton mixing due to the combination of charged lepton corrections and rg running , and that in general there will be other sources of deviations that we do not consider . for example , exact csd @xcite itself will lead to some deviations since it does not predict precisely tb neutrino mixing due to corrections of order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another example of deviations to tb mixing are the canonical normalization effects discussed in @xcite . in general corrections to the tb mixing in the neutrino sector , in the flavour basis , are highly model dependent and have been studied phenomenologically in @xcite .",
    "finally we note that all the results in this paper are based on a numerical approach rather than an analytic approach .",
    "we have given three reasons to justify the use of the numerical approach : firstly that analytic results which ignore the effects of phases are not reliable ( for example the @xmath147 sum rule ) ; secondly that analytic results may not be applicable for all cases of interest ( for example hsd with two large neutrino yukawa couplings ) ; and thirdly that the quantitative precision of the analytic approach is not in general sufficient for our purpose here ( in particular we have shown that the rg correction to @xmath0 may be significantly underestimated in the analytic approach ) .",
    "therefore throughout this paper we have adopted a numerical approach , exploiting the convenient reap package .",
    "to conclude , we have assumed precise tb neutrino mixing at the gut scale , and investigated the deviations due to both charged lepton corrections and rg running . in gut - flavour",
    "inspired models the charged lepton corrections are expected to resemble those of the quark mixing matrix , and lead to neutrino mixing sum rules which are valid at high energy .",
    "we have studied numerically a variety of such neutrino mixing sum rules and shown that , in the types of gut - flavour models in which the sum rules emerge in the first place , they are subject to only mild rg corrections ( less than one degree for the cases studied ) in evolving them down to low energy",
    ". however even such small corrections as described in this paper will nevertheless be important when comparing the neutrino mixing sum rules to the results of future high precision neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",

    "<S> in particular we focus on gut inspired see - saw models with accurate tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing at the gut scale , in which the charged lepton corrections are cabibbo - like and give rise to sum rules valid at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> we study numerically the rg corrections to a variety of such neutrino mixing sum rules in order to assess their accuracy and reliability when comparing them to future low energy neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the rg corrections to neutrino mixing sum rules are typically small ( less than one degree ) , at least in the examples studied with hierarchical neutrinos . </S>"
