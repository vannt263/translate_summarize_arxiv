    "<S> we compute the tunneling conductance of graphene as measured by a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) with a normal / superconducting tip . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for undoped graphene with zero fermi energy , the _ first derivative _ of the tunneling conductance with respect to the applied voltage is proportional to the density of states of the stm tip . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the shape of the stm spectra for graphene doped with impurities depends qualitatively on the position of the impurity atom in the graphene matrix and relate this unconventional phenomenon to the pseudopsin symmetry of the dirac quasiparticles in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest experiments to test our theory . </S>"
