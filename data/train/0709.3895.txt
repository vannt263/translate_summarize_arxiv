    "for good reasons it is by now generally believed that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are powered by supermassive black holes ( bhs ) , with typical masses of about @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , this seems to be the only way to generate the enormous energy of order @xmath1 in regions not much larger than the solar system .",
    "accretion of matter by black holes , offers the most efficient power supply .",
    "a few solar masses of gas per year suffice to power the most energetic quasars .",
    "it is known for long that agns often expel enormous energies in two oppositely directed relativistic jets with lorentz factors @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , moderately large lorentz factors ( @xmath3 a few ) have been seen in bh x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , called _",
    "microquasars_. relativistic jets have also been observed in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . how are these remarkable jets formed ? which mechanisms are responsible for the concentrated energy input at their origin ?",
    "most probably processes connected to bhs are involved . among these ,",
    "perhaps the most promising possibility is the energy extraction from a black hole via magnetic fields , since fairly strong magnetic fields are likely to be present in accretion flows on the central bh .",
    "this scenario , which gives rise to a long - range coherence , is the main subject of this talk .",
    "basic questions to be answered are : which forces drive the jets ?",
    "what are the mechanisms that regulate their content , and how are they collimated ?",
    "penrose first discovered that a substantial fraction of a kerr black hole mass can be converted , at least in principle , into the energy of surrounding matter or radiation . however , the penrose process is inefficient under typical astrophysical conditions .",
    "later it was found that external electromagnetic fields can be used to extract rotational energy of black holes . of great influence was a pioneering study by blandford & znajek @xcite which demonstrated the possibility of an electromagnetically driven wind from a rotating black hole , provided the space around the black hole is filled with plasma . in their paper they developed a general theory of force - free steady - state axisymmetric magnetospheres of black holes , and estimated that the power of the wind could be high enough to explain the energetics of radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "this work triggered the so called _ membrane model _ by thorne and collaborators @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this model one",
    "first splits the elegant 4-dimensional physical laws of general relativity ( gr ) into space and time ( 3 + 1 splitting ) . for a general situation",
    "this can be done in many ways ( reflecting the gauge freedom in gr ) since there is no canonical fibration of spacetime by level surfaces of constant time .",
    "( for a stationary bh we shall choose foliations which are adapted to the corresponding killing field . )",
    "relative to these the dynamical variables ( electromagnetic fields , etc ) become quantities on an _ absolute space _ which evolve as functions of an _ absolute time _ , as we are accustomed to from non - relativistic physics .",
    "we shall see , for example , that the 3 + 1 splitting brings maxwell s equations into a form which resembles the familiar form of maxwell s equations for moving conductors .",
    "we can then use the pictures and our experience from ordinary electrodynamics .    in a second more specific",
    "step one replaces the boundary conditions at the horizon by physical properties ( electric conductivity , etc ) of a",
    "_ fictitious membrane_. this procedure is completely adequate as long as one is not interested in fine details _ very close _ to the horizon .",
    "the details of this boundary layer are , however , completely irrelevant for astrophysical applications .",
    "( the situation is similar to many problems in electrodynamics , where one replaces the real surface properties of a conductor and other media by idealized boundary conditions . )",
    "this approach turns the drawback of the boyer - lindquist coordinates , which become singular at the horizon , into an advantage .",
    "the membrane model has the merit that it allows us to understand astrophysical processes near black holes more easily , because things become then closer to the intuition we have gained from other fields of physics , for instance from the electrodynamics of moving bodies . however , this membrane reformulation of regularity requirements at the horizon  in terms of the singular bl coordinates  is clearly artificial .",
    "more importantly , it hides the fact that the key role in the electrodynamic blandford - znajek mechanism is played not by the black hole event horizon , but by its ergo - sphere ( as in the penrose process ) . later i shall present an alternative derivation of the most important results of blandford and znajek , in making use of kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "this foliation is not singular at the horizon , whence no boundary problems arise .",
    "kerr - schild coordinates not only simplify theoretical analysis , but have also successfully been used in some numerical simulations . in recent years",
    "several codes have been developed to study the magnetic energy extraction from bhs .",
    "in particular , various groups have addressed the question how relativistic jets may have formed . in the last part of the lecture",
    "i will briefly report on what has been done and achieved so far in numerical studies of what is now often dubbed the ( generic ) `` blandford - znajek mechanism '' , although only a specific version was originally proposed .",
    "we begin with some basic material on black hole electrodynamics .",
    "let us perform the 3 + 1 splitting of the general relativistic maxwell equations on a stationary spacetime @xmath4 .",
    "most of what follows could easily be generalized to spacetimes which admit a foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but this is not needed in what follows .",
    "similar 3 + 1 decompositions can be carried out for the other equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) .",
    "slightly more specifically , we shall assume that globally @xmath5 is a product @xmath6 , such that the natural coordinate @xmath7 of @xmath8 is adapted to the killing field @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",

    "this is what one calls the decomposition into lapse and shift ; @xmath17 is the _ lapse function _ and @xmath16 the _ shift vector field_. we shall usually work with adapted coordinates @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a coordinate system on @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath20 , and consider the basis of 1-forms @xmath21 one verifies immediately , that this is dual to the basis @xmath22 of vector fields .",

    "these are measured by observers moving with 4-velocity @xmath15 , so - called fidos , for _ fiducial observers_. one easily finds the following algebraic relations : @xmath33    we give also the coordinate components of the various fields : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the levi - civita tensor on @xmath11 .    in terms of the current 4-vector",
    "@xmath36 the electric charge density is @xmath37 . beside the spatial current 1-form",

    "the maxwell equations can be written in 3 + 1 form as ( @xmath41 denotes the exterior differential on @xmath13 ) : @xmath42 these can be translate into a vector analytic form .",
    "( for this as well as detailed derivations , see @xcite . )",
    "all this looks like maxwell s equations for moving conductors .    *",
    "integral formulas *    as is well - known from ordinary electrodynamics , it is often useful to write the basic laws in integral forms .",

    "this term contributes also for a stationary situation , for which ( [ mod:7 ] ) reduces to @xmath48",

    "this process , like similar iterative root - finding processes in other schemes , is time consuming .",
    "a code that is able to perform long - term ( several thousand of @xmath5 in time ) grmhd simulations , has been developed by villiers & hawley @xcite .",
    "it evolves different auxiliary variables from which the primitive variables are easily recovered .",
    "in contrast to some alternative schemes @xcite , @xcite , it is not fully conservative . since bl coordinates are used , the inner boundary condition must lie outside the horizon .",

    "`` conserved '' quantities to `` primitive '' variables has been improved ( see appendix a ) .",
    "a specific common problem is that the magnetic field is advanced in time by an antisymmetric differential operator , and not by a differential operator of divergence form .",

    "there is a ` centrifugal funnel ' that is largely empty of matter , but filled with magnetic field and an outward poynting flux . between the evacuated funnel and the corona",
    "there is a region of unbounded mass flux , referred to as the ` funnel wall jet ' .",
    "it is this part that is the center of attention in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the strength of the jet compared to the amount of accretion on the bh .",
    "the quantification of this is somewhat ambiguous , because matter and electromagnetic fluxes are usually not constant in time or radius , and there is exchange between the two components .",
    "[ mhd : fig.8.1 ]    the numerical results show that for rapidly - rotating bh s the jet plays a significant role in the energy budget .",
    "when @xmath203 , the total jet efficiency is generally several tens of percent , with the matter portion somewhat larger than the electromagnetic part .",
    "the ratio of _ angular momentum _ in the unbound outflow to that deposited in the bh is also a very strong function of bh spin . in the non - rotating case",
    "this is only a few tenths of a percent , but rises to @xmath204 when @xmath205 . for @xmath206 , the highest spin case reported in @xcite , the rate at which the bh spins down due to electromagnetic torques nearly matches the rate at which it acquires angular momentum by accreting matter .",
    "indeed , the angular momentum expelled in the outflow is an order of magnitude larger than the net amount captured . in all cases ,",
    "the electromagnetic portion of the angular momentum carried away is comparable to the matter portion carried in the funnel wall jet .",
    "it has to be emphasized that in the initial state of the simulations there is no magnetic field in the region that eventually becomes the outflow region .",
    "the large scale magnetic field within the funnel and the poynting flux jet rapidly develop as a result of magnetically controlled accretion .",
    "the formation can be described as follows .",
    "when disk material reaches the horizon , strong magnetic pressure gradients are built up which drive the plasma upward . in turn",
    ", this motion drains off the field lines , forming a `` magnetic tower '' .",
    "this was previously seen in non - relativistic simulations using a pseudo - newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the evacuated funnel is the only region that is force - free . ]",
    "( in contrast to earlier expectations ) .    the matter - dominated outflow moves at a modest velocity ( @xmath207 ) along the centrifugal barrier surrounding the evacuated funnel",
    ". the funnel wall jet turns out to be _ accelerated _ and _ collimated _ by magnetic and gas pressure forces in the inner torus and the surrounding corona .",
    "the magnetic field is spun by the rotating kerr spacetime , hence the energy of the poynting flux jet comes from the bh rotation .",
    "below we will address the question whether magnetic forces might provide additional acceleration and collimation on far larger scales than are modeled in @xcite .",
    "hawley and krolik conclude from their numerical studies that while the proximate energy source is the bh s rotation , accretion _ replenishes _ both the bh s mass and angular momentum .",
    "a substantial decrease of the rotational energy of the bh does not appear to be a generic phenomenon .",
    "this is in contrast to the classic bz model . for a detailed discussion ,",
    "i refer to the original paper .",
    "similar results were found before by mckinney and gammie in their axisymmetric simulations @xcite . among other aspects",
    "these also showed that as the hole loses energy and angular momentum , its total mass and angular momentum are replenished by accretion . in @xcite mckinney followed the evolution of the jet till @xmath208 out to @xmath209 , and found that by then the jet has become superfast magnetosonic and moves at a lorentz factor of about 10 .",
    "this may , however , only be a small fraction of the lorentz factor at much larger distances . indeed ,",
    "if a large fraction of the magnetic and thermal energy would go into particle kinetic energy , one would estimate from the simulation that the terminal lorentz factor may reach almost @xmath210 .",
    "this estimate is based on the following fact . for a stationary axisymmetric flow the energy ( momentum ) flux per unit rest - mass flux",
    "is conserved along flux surfaces and can thus be determined from local flow quantities . the relevant formula for this quantity is , using previous notation , @xmath211    since the simulation in @xcite stopped long before the end of the acceleration period , komissarov et al .",
    "have studied numerically the further evolution of the relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "key issues of this investigation are : ( i ) is the magnetic driving mechanism able to accelerate outflows to high lorentz factors with high efficiency over astrophysically extended scales ?",
    "( ii ) can these flows be collimated by purely magnetic stresses ?",
    "since most of the acceleration takes place far away from the black hole , the simulations are carried out in the framework of special - relativistic ideal mhd .",
    "the authors investigate models of the following kind .",
    "the free boundary with an ambient medium is replaced by solid rigid walls on which appropriate boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "this simplification enables higher numerical accuracy . at the inlet boundary",
    ", the injected poloidal current distribution is prescribed through a rotational profile .",
    "the initial configuration corresponds to a non - rotating purely poloidal magnetic field with nearly constant magnetic pressure across the funnel .",
    "moreover , the outflows are initially poynting flux - dominated .",
    "the authors find that these approach a steady state with a spatially extended acceleration region .",
    "furthermore , the acceleration process turns out to be very efficient ; almost 80% of the poynting flux is converted into kinetic energy",
    ". the results also show efficient self - collimation .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , no instabilities or shocks are found in the simulation .",
    "we have already remarked earlier that even for very rapidly rotating black holes the blandford - znajek process can drive magnetized jets .",
    "[ mhd : fig.8.2 ] from @xcite shows clearly that there is no `` meissner effect '' at work .",
    "this is due to the fact that within the ergosphere the plasma unavoidably corotates with the black hole .    )",
    "3 of @xcite ] . ]",
    "[ mhd : fig.8.2 ]    one of the main shortcomings of existing simulations is that the radiation field is completely neglected .",
    "it is likely that radiative and other high energy processes play a significant role in the flow dynamics through radiation force on the outflowing plasma .",
    "moreover , at some point physical resistivity will also have to be included , and the single - fluid approximation will not always hold everywhere .",
    "numerical calculations will be performed in 3d .",
    "most grmhd codes have adopted a _ conservative scheme _ , which means that the integrated evolutionary equations are of the general form @xmath212 here ,",
    "@xmath213 are vector - valued `` conserved '' variables , @xmath214 is a vector of `` primitive '' variables ( rest - mass density , internal energy density , velocity components and magnetic field components ) .",
    "the fluxes @xmath215 and the `` source vector '' @xmath216 depend on @xmath214 .",
    "conservative numerical schemes advance @xmath213 , then calculate @xmath217 once or twice per time step .    while in praxis the map @xmath218 is analytically known , the inverse map @xmath219 is not available in closed form and must be computed numerically .",
    "how this is performed is at the heart of a conservative scheme , since the operation must be accurate , fast and robust .",
    "below we describe these points in more detail , following @xcite .",
    "we use the notation and basic equations introduced in sect .",
    "equations ( [ mhd:6.2 ] ) , ( [ mhd:6.3 ] ) and ( [ mhd:6.7b ] ) can readily be written in the form ( [ ap:1 ] ) in terms of the eight conserved variables @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",
    "as eight primitive variables we use @xmath222 ( the vector @xmath32 is common to @xmath213 and @xmath214 . )    in @xcite it is shown that @xmath223 , where @xmath224 , and @xmath225 can be determined from @xmath213 by solving two polynomial equations .",
    "after that one can easily recover all primitive variables .",
    "this important instability , whose crucial astrophysical implications have been understood astonishingly late , shows up already in linearized theory . for a detailed pedagogical discussion",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in a systematic treatment one",
    "linearizes the basic equations of mhd for small fluctuations of a disk system , consisting of a central point mass and a differentially rotating magnetized disk .",
    "an analysis of the resulting rather complicated dispersion relation leads to the following results . in the non - rotating limit ( homogeneous unperturbed situation )",
    "one finds the familiar alfvn waves and two other mhd modes .",
    "the fast one is often referred to as magnetosonic wave , and represents magnetic and thermal pressure in concert . in the slow mode magnetic tension and gas compression act in opposition . for weak fields",
    "it becomes degenerate with the alfvn mode , while for strong fields it becomes an ordinary sound wave , channeled along the field lines .",
    "there is a simple way to understand this far reaching instability .",
    "consider an axisymmetric gas disk in the presence of a vertical magnetic field , that has no effect on the disk equilibrium .",
    "assume that a fluid element is displaced from its circular orbit by @xmath226 ( @xmath227 vertical direction ) .",
    "using the induction law and simple mechanics one finds the these incompressible planar displacements satisfy the same equation as the separation of two orbiting mass points , connected by a spring ( with a spring constant related to the alfvn velocity ) .",
    "it is quite obvious that this system is unstable ; the separation of the two mass points rapidly increases .",
    "this is the essence of the weak - field magneto - rotational instability .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers of the symposium on gravitation and cosmology , in particular c. laemmerzahl and a. macias , for inviting me and their wonderful hospitality .",
