    "even though macroscopically charged black holes are not expected to be produced in realistic astrophysical scenarios , we can obtain fascinating information on the structure and behavior of einstein equations and general relativity with the study of these objects . here , we used the charged vaidya metric to model time - dependent black holes with an electric charge , and study the behavior of the quasinormal modes in a non - stationary background .",
