    "because the products of hydrostatic silicon burning are trapped deep in the potential well of their parent star , it is only by explosion that the interstellar medium is enriched in intermediate mass and iron peak elements . in core collapse supernovae ,",
    "the neutrino driven shock passes through the silicon and oxygen shells , heating the material and driving at least a portion outward . for thermonuclear supernovae , the degenerate ignition of carbon and oxygen provides both the fuel for silicon burning and the energy required to unbind this material from its parent white dwarf . in both cases , matter is heated rapidly to temperatures sufficient to destroy silicon and expelled outward , to expand and cool adiabatically .",
    "thus , understanding the chemical evolution of the intermediate mass and iron peak elements , and how the formation of these elements affects the supernovae which produce them , requires understanding the behavior of silicon burning under such explosive conditions .",
    "recent calculations of both core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae seem to indicate that , in both cases , silicon burning occurs in material subject to strong hydrodynamic instabilities , prompting two- and ultimately three - dimensional simulations .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for discussion of convection prior to core collapse ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for discussion of core collapse instabilities ; and @xcite , and @xcite for discussion of turbulent flames in thermonuclear supernovae . while it has been possible to perform simulations of silicon burning using large nuclear networks within spherically symmetric models comprised of hundreds of zones , the need to understand silicon burning in these multi - dimensional contexts , with the attendant squaring and cubing of the number of zones , demands more efficient calculation .",
    "this provides an additional motivation for our study , as we seek to leverage our understanding of silicon burning to reduce its computational cost .    in a previous paper , @xcite , henceforth ht96",
    ", we described how the physics of silicon burning is dominated by partial equilibria among groups of nuclei well before complete nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) is established .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of quasi - equilibrium ( qse ) , contending that the solar system abundances of nuclei between neon and the iron peak could be explained by a single quasi - equilibrium group which stretched from magnesium through the iron peak but failed to reach nse .",
    "this mechanism unified the @xmath0- and e - processes of @xcite and reconciled moderately well with the nuclear network calculations of @xcite .",
    "qse is a local equilibrium with respect to strong and electromagnetic reactions , i.e. the exchange of neutrons , protons , @xmath0-particles and photons . in ht96",
    ", we demonstrated that the abundance of a nucleus in qse with @xmath2 , for example , is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the abundances of free neutrons , free protons , and @xmath2 .",
    "the thermodynamic conditions and nuclear properties are contained within the expressions @xmath7 which has been defined for later convenience , with @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the partition function and binding energy of the nucleus @xmath11 , @xmath12 is avagadro s number , @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the density and temperature of the plasma .",
    "it is worth noting that , due to the @xmath16 term , declining temperature favors the more tightly bound nuclei .",
    "furthermore , for the thermodynamic conditions common to silicon burning , the nuclear binding energy , @xmath10 , must be corrected for the effects of coulomb screening ( @xcite ) .    as eq .",
    "[ eq : qse ] demonstrates , the abundance of any nucleus in quasi - equilibrium can be expressed as a function of just three abundances , the thermodynamic conditions ( @xmath14 , @xmath17 ) and the properties of that nucleus , subsumed here within @xmath18 .",
    "thus the evolution of the abundances of @xmath2 and the free nucleons defines the behavior of all the nuclei in qse with @xmath2 .",
    "one can naturally construct similar equations relative to nuclei other than @xmath2 , though for all nuclei within the silicon qse group , all such equations reduce to eq .",
    "[ eq : qse ] .",
    "this expression for quasi - equilibrium , eq .",
    "[ eq : qse ] , is also identical to those defined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , provided the @xmath0-particles , protons and neutrons are internally in equilibrium .",
    "we find that , by the time quasi - equilibrium is established in the vicinity of silicon , these light nuclei consistently have formed their own qse group , with abundances in this light qse group obeying the nse relation ( eq.[eq : nse ] ) .",
    "these light nuclei remain in qse until the bulk of the photodisintegration rates freezeout for @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast to quasi - equilibrium , nuclear statistical equilibrium is a global equilibrium . from arguments based on chemical potentials or detailed balance of reactions ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) , an expression for the equilibrium abundances of all nuclei",
    "can be derived , @xmath20 here @xmath18 is identical to eq .",
    "[ eq : cnse ] , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the free neutron and free proton abundances . thus in nse , the abundances of all nuclei are functions of only two abundances .",
    "substitution of eq .",
    "[ eq : nse ] , evaluated for @xmath2 , into eq .",
    "[ eq : qse ] , reveals that for all nuclei eq .",
    "[ eq : qse ] reduces to eq .",
    "[ eq : nse ] if @xmath2 has reached nse . thus failure of a quasi - equilibrium group to reach nse implies that while the members of the group have achieved equilibrium with respect to the exchange of free nucleons and @xmath0-particles , they have not achieved global equilibrium with the free nucleons .    in ht96 , in order to separate the details of silicon burning from the vagaries of hydrodynamics",
    ", we considered only constant thermodynamic conditions .",
    "further , we limited ourselves to conditions appropriate for hydrostatic silicon burning in the late stages of stellar evolution . while the thermodynamic variations within the core of a star undergoing hydrostatic silicon burning occur slowly , this is certainly not true for convective or explosive silicon burning .",
    "if quasi - equilibrium is to be useful in understanding and simplifying the modeling of silicon burning within a hydrodynamic supernova model , it is necessary to demonstrate that its applicability is not limited to constant conditions . as a representative analytic model for silicon burning occurring as a result of shock heating , we will consider a mass zone which is instantaneously heated by a passing shock to some peak initial temperature , @xmath21 , and density , @xmath22 , and then expands and cools adiabatically . following the approximation introduced by @xcite , the expansion timescale ( equal to the free fall timescale ) is @xmath23 with the time dependence of the density and temperature of this radiation dominated gas given by @xmath24 assuming the adiabatic exponent @xmath25 .",
    "this model provides a strong but simple test of the behavior of quasi - equilibrium under varying conditions .",
    "previous authors , beginning with @xcite , have shown that for explosive burning , the @xmath26 plane is divided into 3 regions .",
    "figure 1 portrays this division for material with @xmath27 , while also showing the remnant helium mass fraction .",
    "the squares plotted in this figure indicate the range of conditions found in the w7 model for type ia supernovae ( see @xcite ) , while the circles show conditions typical for type ii supernovae models ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . in the first region , roughly defined by @xmath28 , cooling due to the expansion halts the destruction of silicon prematurely , resulting in a larger remnant concentration of intermediate mass elements than nuclear statistical equilibrium would suggest . quite naturally ,",
    "this is referred to as _ incomplete silicon burning_. for higher temperatures silicon is exhausted , and nse is reached before the reactions freeze out . for moderately large densities ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "the abundances of the light qse group nuclei are relatively small , allowing these light nuclei to pass through the a=5 - 8 bottleneck and form heavier nuclei as the temperature , and therefore their equilibrium population , drops .",
    "when this occurs , nse persists up until freezeout at @xmath30 , resulting in a _",
    "normal freezeout_. at lower densities the light group nuclei , especially @xmath31 , contain a large portion of the nuclear mass fraction",
    ". this larger nse abundance of light nuclei , coupled with the reduced reaction flow through the bottleneck due to the quadratic density dependence of the rates for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 reactions which bridge this mass gap , prevents the incorporation of all of these light nuclei into heavier nuclei on the timescale of the cooling .",
    "since the same binding energy considerations which favor the iron peak nuclei in nse also favor @xmath0-particles over free nucleons , the light group mass is dominated by @xmath0-particles , hence this is termed _",
    "@xmath0-rich freezeout_. this paper will analyze and demonstrate the applicability of quasi - equilibrium for each of the 3 results of explosive silicon burning detailed above .",
    "we begin with incomplete silicon burning and an example where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "figure 2a displays the ratio of the network abundances to their silicon qse abundances plotted as a function of atomic mass after an elapsed time of @xmath37 seconds .",
    "this figure is reminiscent of the figures discussed in ht96 . as in ht96",
    ", these qse abundances are calculated from the network values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath38 , not on an independant qse - based calculation . in figures 2 , 3 & 5 , the filled triangles , squares and circles mark the core nuclei of the 3 qse group discussed in that paper .",
    "these same 3 qse groups are clearly present here , one composed of the light nuclei , the second centered on silicon and the third containing the iron peak nuclei . one point to note",
    "is the apparent displacement of @xmath39 from the light group .",
    "we believe that this is due to a limitation of our reaction set , which contains many fewer reactions involving @xmath39 than reactions involving @xmath31 .",
    "if the corresponding reactions for @xmath39 , which are important only to the abundance of @xmath39 , were included , @xmath39 would also be in qse with the free nucleons .",
    "clearly quasi - equilibrium is well established early in this calculation .",
    "we then must ask , under what conditions does quasi - equilibrium fail to be a good approximation to the network abundances ?",
    "figure 2b is similar to figure 2a , with an elapsed time of @xmath40 seconds . by this time ,",
    "@xmath17  has dropped to 4.5 and @xmath41 .",
    "the evolution of the qse groups follows the pattern discussed under constant thermodynamic conditions in ht96 , with both the light and iron peak groups converging toward the silicon group .",
    "in particular , the convergence of the light and silicon qse groups reflects the approach of the network abundances to those calculated from nse for the current thermodynamic conditions .    , @xmath42 , and @xmath36 after elapsed time of @xmath43 seconds .",

    " 1 , in equilibrium , decreasing temperature favors the more bound members of a group of nuclei . in this case , decreasing temperature raises the quasi - equilibrium abundances of the iron peak nuclei relative to all other nuclei . over this span of time , though the abundances of the iron peak nuclei are increasing , their qse abundances are increasing more rapidly , moving the iron peak qse group away from equilibrium with silicon . similarly , because of the shift in favor of heavier nuclei , though the network abundance of silicon is declining , the equilibrium abundance of silicon is declining more rapidly , leaving silicon further from equilibrium with the free nucleons . in spite of these movements ,",
    "quasi - equilibrium is still a good approximation , with the abundances in the iron peak group , which comprises 80% of the mass by the time @xmath49 seconds have passed ( corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , having a spread of a few % from quasi - equilibrium , while those in the silicon group ( comprising 10% of the mass ) have a spread of roughly 15% .    , @xmath42 , and @xmath36 after elapsed time of @xmath52 seconds ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",

    "as figure 5c shows , these 2 tight qse groups are linked across more than 30 orders of magnitude difference in quasi - equilibrium by a string of small grouplets with constant n and individual nuclei . as in the previous cases , the continued decline of temperature toward @xmath17=3 breaks qse even within the light and iron peak groups . as comparison of columns 4 and 5 of table  [ tab : arf ] shows , by an elapsed time of .293 seconds , the abundance of @xmath31 is 40% smaller than qse would predict based on the network abundances of free protons and neutrons , with similar errors occurring among the most abundant nuclei in the iron peak group . unlike previous cases ,",
    "while the free proton and neutron abundance decline markedly below @xmath17=3.5 , the large @xmath0  mass fraction ( 8% ) remains virtually unchanged . within the time allowed by the cooling timescale",

    "only those abundances which are large compared to the decline in @xmath179 are unchanged by freezeout",
    ". however , since it is these most abundant nuclei which dominate the energetics of nucleosynthesis , qse ( and future qse based methods ) can provide reasonable estimates of the energy release and other bulk nuclear properties necessary for accurate hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "in addition , though the qse abundances frozen at @xmath17=3 ( column 5 ) underestimate the final abundances of the important @xmath0-rich iron peak nuclei by factors of a few to 10 , these estimates are much more accurate than the corresponding nse abundances ( column 6 ) .",
    "thus , even in the case of @xmath0-rich freezeout , where its predictions are the least reliable , quasi - equilibrium provides estimates of the nucleosynthesis which are adequate for accurate hydrodynamic modeling and much better than those provided by nse .",
    "through these examples we have demonstrated that quasi - equilibrium continues to be a useful approximation during silicon burning even when the thermodynamic gradients are strong .",
    "provided there is sufficient abundance within a qse groups , adjustments within the group happen much faster than reactions outside of these groups .",
    "furthermore these adjustments occur on the timescales of the unbalanced reactions , much more rapidly than reasonable thermodynamic variations . in a recent paper ( @xcite )",

    "@xmath0-rich freezeout _ occurs .",
    "the resultant overabundance of @xmath0-particles and free nucleons obeys quasi - equilibrium , as does the enhancement of more massive iron peak nuclei .",
    "quasi - equilibrium fails in the vicinity of silicon once silicon is exhausted , but the light and iron peak groups which dominate the nuclear evolution continue to obey quasi - equilibrium until the temperature drops to roughly @xmath180 kelvins . though the continued capture of the large abundances of light nuclei does result in significant abundance changes , predictions of abundance based on qse provide good estimates of the largest abundances and hence the energetics and are significantly more reliable than those based on nse . for expansion which occurs more slowly ,",
    "previous authors have contended that silicon burned quickly to nse , and that subsequently the nuclear distribution smoothly followed nse until the nse froze out at roughly @xmath181 .",
    "we have found that while the abundances of the dominant nuclei , the iron peak nuclei , free nucleons and @xmath0-particles , do follow nse rather smoothly , the intermediate nuclei , carbon , oxygen , and silicon , for example , lag behind . as a result the abundances of these nuclei can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude at freezeout .",
    "more importantly for our purposes , though nse fails to properly account for these abundances , quasi - equilibrium remains an accurate estimate for these as well as the more important nuclei .",
    "thus quasi - equilibrium provides estimates of abundances as accurate or more accurate than nse , even in the case of the _",
    "normal freezeout_. taken together , we see that even for simulations which include strong thermodynamic gradients , quasi - equilibrium reliably provides good estimates of the abundances of many nuclear species resulting from silicon burning , and will be a valuable tool as we investigate the nucleosynthesis predictions of multi - dimensional supernovae simulations .",
