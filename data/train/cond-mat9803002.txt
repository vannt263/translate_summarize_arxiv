    "density  functional theory ( dft ) has been very successful in predicting several physical properties of the ferroelectric perovskites , most implementations being performed within the local  density approximation ( lda ) . here",
    "we assess the performance of the alternative hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) scheme for these materials , which have an intermediate ionic / covalent character . in general , dft is particularly convenient and accurate for metals and semiconductors  @xcite , while the hf scheme is very reliable for ionic crystals , and insulators in general  @xcite . in this paper , we address at the hf level some fundamental dielectric properties , such as the dynamical ionic charges and the dielectric constant , in two paradigmatic ferroelectric perovskites : knbo@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 .    the very first hf study of a ferroelectric perovskite , at the _ ab  initio _ level , has been published very recently  @xcite .",
    "the case study was knbo@xmath0 , and several properties of the electronic ground state were investigated , including the broken - symmetry instability of the tetragonal structure of this material . in this same work the berry  phase theory of macroscopic polarization@xcite is implemented within the hf scheme , using first - principles ingredients . perhaps the most interesting result that has emerged is that the calculated hf spontaneous polarization of knbo@xmath0 in its tetragonal phase is 0.34 c / m@xmath1 , quite close to the experimental value@xcite , which is 0.37 c / m@xmath1 , as well as previous lda results@xcite , which are between 0.33 and 0.40 c / m@xmath1 .",
    "although the computed value of the spontaneous polarization is almost identical within lda and hf , we will show that there are significant differences when the dynamical charges of the ions are separately investigated .",
    "these polarizabilities are dominated by covalency effects , which plausibly are described in different ways at the hf and lda levels .",
    "we will then show that , by combining results from both berry  phase calculations and supercell calculations , one has access to the theoretical value of the electronic dielectric constant @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that lda overestimates the value of @xmath2 in any material , whereas it has been only guessed that hf underestimates it , since no calculation was previously available , for any material .",
    "our hf calculated @xmath2 of knbo@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 and mgo are indeed smaller than experimental values .",
    "finally , we will show some results for batio@xmath0 slabs , including both isolated and periodic slabs with different terminations . since most first ",
    "principles schemes are implemented within plane  wave based computational methods , they are very effective for infinite periodic systems but can not treat the isolated slabs .",
    "even the periodic slabs with moderate vacuum separations prove to be a heavy computational burden for plane  wave methods , and only a few such calculations have been performed for ferroelectric perovskites@xcite .",
    "the capability of dealing with a genuinely isolated slab is a virtue of the localized  basis implementation adopted here  @xcite",
    ". we will discuss bulk dielectric properties , surface charge , surface energies , work function , and surface dynamical charges .",
    "we will show how the computed values of these quantities change as functions of the number of atomic layers and the thickness of the vacuum layers separating the periodic slabs . owing to a recently discovered theorem ,",
    "the dynamical charge of a given ion at a polar surface _ can not _ have the same value as in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "the transverse ( born ) charge tensor is defined via the macroscopic polarization @xmath3 linearly induced by a rigid displacement @xmath4 of the @xmath5 sublattice , while the field is kept at zero value@xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the cell volume , and atomic units are used throughout .",
    "the longitudinal ( callen ) charge tensor @xmath8 is similarly defined , but with the sublattice displacement performed in a depolarization field @xmath9 .",
    "the relation between the two dynamical charges is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant in the relevant direction . in general",
    ", the dynamical charge can be very different from the nominal static charge of an ion .",
    "the differences are particularly dramatic when the material has a mixed ionic ",
    "covalent character , such as the materials chosen in the present work  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the @xmath12 as a berry  phase@xcite , while we calculate the @xmath13 using a supercell technique .",
    "the latter approach was introduced by martin and kunc several years ago to compute dynamic charges in semiconductors@xcite , and is still very much in use today in the framework of lda pseudopotential calculations with plane  wave basis sets .",
    "the same supercell technique in the framework of hf calculations with a localized basis set was implemented for the first time in ref . @xcite . since the aim of the present work is to assess the hf values versus lda ones , we only present here results for the cubic structure .",
    "for knbo@xmath0 we use the lattice constant 4.016  .",
    "this is the same value used in the lda study of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the low  temperature experimental data@xcite . for batio@xmath0",
    ", we use the lattice constant 4.006  .",
    "figure 1 shows the structure of these perovskites .",
    "( 14.9,5.5 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 7,5.5 )    we use the crystal95 code , which implements both the hf and lda self consistent scheme with a linear  combination  of - atomic  orbitals ( lcao ) basis set@xcite . in our supercell calculations ,",
    "we displace the sublattice of an atom in the supercell lattice , and compute the planar average of the charge density , potential , and field .",
    "we then perform additionally the macroscopic average defined as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which proves an invaluable tool in the present business .",
    "the output of the supercell calculations provide the longitudinal dynamical charges .",
    "we use both 3fold and 4fold supercells in our supercell calculations , which yield almost identical results .",
    "we refer to the original paper for more details  @xcite .    in our berry  phase calculations , we compute the induced macroscopic polarization @xmath3 in zero field , and thus the corresponding transverse dynamical charges . in order to compare with the lda results and examine the performance of our localized basis set",
    ", we also run the crystal95 code in the lda option for knbo@xmath0 .",
    "our results for knbo@xmath0 dynamic charges are reported in table i.    table i. dynamical charges for knbo@xmath0 +    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we notice that bao@xmath14 planes and tio@xmath15 planes are _ nominally _ charge neutral , in the hypothesis of complete ionicity .",
    "but dynamical charges  particularly in a material having mixed ionic ",
    "covalent character as the present one  are dramatically different from the static nominal ones . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the data in the last two columns of tab .",
    "iii show that bao@xmath14 planes and tio@xmath15 planes are far from being dynamically neutral , both in the bulk and in the surface region .",
    "as observed above , the surface of a centrosymmetric slab is charge ",
    "neutral as far as the _ static _",
    "charge accumulated in the surface region is concerned .",
    "this fact implies  owing to a recently discovered theorem  @xcite  that the surface region must also be _ dynamically _ neutral .",
    "we notice that the dynamical charges in the surface region deviate considerably from their bulk value , although they converge rather fast to it .",
    "a corollary of the dynamical  neutrality theorem , as applied to the [ 001 ] geometry considered here , states the the sum of the dynamical charges in the surface planes must add up to _ one half _ of the corresponding bulk value ( with the appropriate sign )  @xcite .",
    "this sum rule  which can be regarded as the surface analogue of the popular acoustic sum rule for the bulk  @xcite  is very accurately fullfilled by our calculations .",
    "in fact summing over the two outermost surface layers we get @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the two nonequivalent surfaces .",
    "both figures are indeed very close ( in modulus ) to one half of the dynamical charge of a given bulk plane .",
    "we have reported several _ ab  initio _ hf results concerning bulk and surface properties of two important ferroelectric perovskites : knbo@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 .",
    "though some of our results are preliminary , they indeed assess the accuracy of both the physical approximations and the computational implementation .    about the physical approximations ,",
    "comparison of our results with the experiment indicates an overall trend : the hf results are about of the same quality as ",
    "but on the opposite side of  the lda results .",
    "this trend makes hf an appealing method for `` bracketing '' a theoretical prediction : it is well exemplified by the case study of the dielectric constant @xmath2 discussed here for knbo@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , and even for the simpler oxide mgo .    about the computational implementation within a localized basis set ,",
    "we have emphasized its merits by showing some case studies of surface properties , where we can study genuinely isolated slabs in vacuo .",
    "this is at variance with basically all previous first ",
    "principle investigation of surface properties which , for any material , were typically performed within supercell ( _ i.e. _ periodically repeated slab ) geometries .",
    "we are indebted to s. dallolio and r. dovesi for discussions and help in using crystal95 , as well as for providing us with optimized values of the bulk computational parameters .",
