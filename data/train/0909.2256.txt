    "inflation generically predicts a primordial spectrum of density perturbations which is almost precisely gaussian @xcite . in recent years",
    "the small non - gaussian component @xcite has emerged as an important observable @xcite , and will be measured with good precision by the _",
    "planck surveyor _ satellite @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "as observational data become more plentiful , it will be important to understand the non - gaussian signal expected in a wide variety of models , and to anticipate what conclusions can be drawn about early - universe physics from a prospective detection of primordial non - gaussianity .    in this paper",
    ", we present a novel method for calculating the primordial non - gaussianity produced by super - horizon evolution in two - field models of inflation .",
    "our method is based on the real - space distribution of inflationary field values on a flat hypersurface , which can be thought of as a probability density function whose evolution is determined by a form of the collisionless boltzmann equation . using a cumulant representation @xcite to expand our density function around an exact gaussian",
    ", we derive ordinary differential equations which evolve the moments of this distribution .",
    "further , we show how these moments are related to observable quantities , such as the dimensionless bispectrum measured by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we present numerical results which show that this method gives good agreement with other techniques .",
    "it is not necessary to make any assumptions about the inflationary model beyond requiring a canonical kinetic term and applying the slow - roll approximation .",
    "while there are already numerous methods for computing the super - horizon contribution to @xmath1 , including the widely used @xmath0 formalism , we believe the one reported here has a number of advantages .",
    "first , this new technique is ideally suited to unraveling the various contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "this is because we follow the moments of the inflaton distribution directly , which makes it straightforward to identify large contributions to the skewness or other moments .",
    "the evolution equation for each moment is simple and possesses clearly identifiable source terms , which are related to the properties of the inflationary flow on field space .",
    "this offers a clear separation between two key sources of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "one of these is the intrinsic non - linearity associated with evolution of the probability density function between successive flat hypersurfaces ; the other is a gauge transformation from field fluctuations to the curvature peturbation , @xmath2 .",
    "it would be difficult or impossible to observe this split within the context of other calculational schemes , such as the conventional @xmath0 formalism .",
    "a second advantage of our method is connected with the computational cost of numerical implementation .",
    "analytic formulas for @xmath1 are known in certain cases , mostly in the context of the @xmath0 framework , but only for very specific choices of the potential @xcite or hubble rate @xcite .",
    "these formulas become increasingly cumbersome as the number of fields increases , or if one studies higher moments @xcite . in the future , it seems clear that studies of complex models with many fields will increasingly rely on numerical methods .",
    "the numerical @xmath0 framework requires the solution to a number of ordinary differential equations which scales exponentially with the number of fields .",
    "since some models include hundreds of fields , this may present a significant obstacle @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 formalism depends crucially on a numerical integration algorithm with low noise properties , since finite differences must be extracted between perturbatively different initial conditions after @xmath3 e - folds of evolution .",
    "thus , the background equations must be solved to great accuracy , since any small error has considerable scope to propagate .    in this paper",
    "we ultimately solve our equations numerically to determine the evolution of moments in specific models .",
    "our method requires the solution to a number of differential equations which scales at most polynomially ( or in certain cases perhaps even linearly ) with the number of fields .",
    "it does not rely on extracting finite differences , and therefore is much less susceptible to numerical noise .",
    "these advantages may be shared with other schemes , such as the numerical method recently employed by lehners & renaux - petel @xcite .",
    "a third advantage , to which we hope to return in a future publication , is that our formalism yields explicit evolution equations with source terms . from an analysis of these source terms , we hope that it will be possible to identify those physical features of specific models which lead to the production of large non - gaussianities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : computing_fnl ] , we show how the non - gaussian parameter @xmath1 can be computed in our framework .",
    "the calculation remains in real space throughout ( as opposed to fourier space ) , which modifies the relationship between @xmath1 and the multi - point functions of the inflaton field .",
    "our expression for @xmath1 shows a clean separation between different contributions to non - gaussianity , especially between the intrinsic nonlinearity of the field evolution and the gauge transformation between comoving and flat hypersurfaces . in  [ sec : transport ] , we introduce our model for the distribution of inflaton field values , which is a  moment expansion \" around a purely gaussian distribution .",
    "we derive the equations which govern the evolution of the moments of this distribution in the one- and two - field cases . in  [ sec : numerics ] , we present a comparison of our new technique and those already in the literature . we compute @xmath1 numerically in several two - field models , and find excellent agreement between techniques .",
    "we conclude in  [ s : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use units in which @xmath4 , and the reduced planck mass @xmath5 is set to unity .",
    "in this section , we introduce our new method for computing the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this method requires three main ingredients : a formula for the curvature perturbation , @xmath2 , in terms of the field values on a spatially flat hypersurface ; expressions for the derivatives of the number of e - foldings , @xmath6 , as a function of field values at horizon exit ; and a prescription for evolving the field distribution from horizon exit to the time when we require the statistical properties of @xmath2 .",
    "the first two ingredients are given in eqs .",
    " and  , found at the end of  [ ss : sep_universe ] and  [ sec : derivative - n ] respectively .",
    "the final ingredient is discussed in  [ sec : transport ] .      once it became clear that non - linearities of the microwave background anisotropies could be detected by the wmap and _ planck _ survey satellites @xcite , many authors studied higher - order correlations of the curvature perturbation . in early work , direct calculations of a correlation function were matched to the known limit of local non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "this method works well if isocurvature modes are absent , so that the curvature perturbation is constant after horizon exit . in the more realistic situation that isocurvature modes cause evolution on superhorizon scales , all correlation functions become time dependent .",
    "various formalisms have been employed to describe this evolution .",
    "lyth & rodrguez @xcite extended the @xmath0 method @xcite beyond linear order .",
    "this method is simple and well - suited to analytical calculation .",
    "rigopoulos , shellard and van tent @xcite worked with a gradient expansion , rewriting the field equations in langevin form .",
    "the noise term was used as a proxy for setting initial conditions at horizon crossing .",
    "a similar ` exact ' gradient formalism was written down by langlois & vernizzi @xcite . in its perturbative form",
    ", this approach has been used by lehners & renaux - petel to obtain numerical results @xcite .",
    "another numerical scheme has been introduced by huston & malik @xcite .",
    "what properties do we require of a successful prediction ? consider a typical observer , drawn at random from an ensemble of realizations of inflation . in any of the formalisms",
    "discussed above , we aim to estimate the statistical properties of the curvature perturbation which would be measured by such an observer .",
    "some realizations may yield statistical properties which are quite different from the ensemble average , but these large excursions are uninteresting unless anthropic arguments are in play .",
    "next we introduce a collection of comparably - sized spacetime volumes whose mutual scatter is destined to dominate the microwave background anisotropy on a given scale .",
    "neglecting spatial gradients , each spacetime volume will follow a trajectory in field space which is slightly displaced from its neighbors .",
    "the scatter between trajectories is determined by initial conditions set at horizon exit , which are determined by promoting the vacuum fluctuation to a classical perturbation .",
    "a correct prediction is a function of the trajectories followed by every volume in the collection , taken as a whole .",
    "one never makes a prediction for a single trajectory .",
    "each spacetime volume follows a trajectory , which we label with its position @xmath7 at some fixed time , to be made precise below . throughout this paper ,",
    "superscript ` @xmath8 ' denotes evaluation on a spatially flat hypersurface .",
    "consider the evolution of some quantity of interest , @xmath9 , which is a function of trajectory .",
    "if we know the distribution @xmath10 we can study statistical properties of @xmath9 such as the @xmath11 moment @xmath12 , @xmath13^m , \\ ] ] where we have introduced the ensemble average of @xmath9 , @xmath14 in eqs .   , @xmath7 stands for a collection of any number of fields .",
    "it is the @xmath12 which are observable quantities .",
    ".   defines what we will call the exact separate universe picture .",
    "it is often convenient to expand @xmath15 as a power series in the field values centered on a fiducial trajectory , labelled ` fid , ' @xmath16 when eq .",
    "is used to evaluate the @xmath12 , we refer to the ` perturbative ' separate universe picture .",
    "if all terms in the power series are retained , these two versions of the calculation are formally equivalent . in unfavorable cases , however , convergence may occur slowly or not at all .",
    "this possibility was discussed in refs .",
    "although our calculation is formally perturbative , it is not directly equivalent to eq .  .",
    "we briefly discuss the relation of our calculation to conventional perturbation theory in ",
    "[ s : conclusions ] .      by definition , the curvature perturbation @xmath2 measures local fluctuations in expansion history ( expressed in e - folds @xmath6 ) , calculated on a comoving hypersurface . in many models , the curvature perturbation is synthesized by superhorizon physics , which reprocesses a set of gaussian fluctuations generated at horizon exit . in a single - field model",
    ", only one gaussian fluctuation can be present , which we label @xmath17 . neglecting spatial gradients , the total curvature perturbation",
    "must then be a function of @xmath17 alone . for @xmath18",
    ", this can be well - approximated by @xmath19 where @xmath1 is independent of spatial position .",
    "defines the so - called `` local '' form of non - gaussianity .",
    "it applies only when quantum interference effects can be neglected , making @xmath2 a well - defined object rather than a superposition of operators @xcite .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , spatial correlations of @xmath2 may be extracted and it follows that @xmath1 can be estimated using the rule @xmath20 where we have recalled that @xmath2 is nearly gaussian , or equivalently that @xmath21 .    with @xmath1 spatially independent , eq .   strictly applies only in single - field inflation . in this case",
    "one can accurately determine @xmath1 by applying eq .   to a single trajectory with fixed initial conditions , as in the method of lehners & renaux - petel @xcite .",
    "where more than one field is present , @xmath1 may vary in space because it depends on the isocurvature modes . in this case",
    "one must determine @xmath1 statistically on a bundle of adjacent trajectories which sample the local distribution of isocurvature modes .",
    "is then indispensible .",
    "following maldacena @xcite , and later lyth & rodrguez @xcite , we adopt eq .   as our definition of @xmath1 , whatever its origin . in real space , the coefficient @xmath22 in eq .",
    "depends on the convention @xmath23 .",
    "more generally , this follows from the definition of @xmath12 , eq .  .",
    "in fourier space , either prescription is automatically enforced after dropping disconnected contributions , again leading to eq .  .    to proceed , we require estimates of the correlation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we first describe the conventional approach , in which ` @xmath8 ' denotes a flat hypersurface at a fixed initial time .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 denotes the number of e - foldings between this initial slice and a final comoving hypersurface , where @xmath27 indexes the species of light scalar fields .",
    "the local variation in expansion can be written in the fiducial picture as @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "subject to the condition that the relevant scales are all outside the horizon , we are free to choose the initial time  set by the hypersurface ` @xmath8'at our convenience . in the conventional approach , ` @xmath8 ' is taken to lie a few e - folds after our collection of spacetime volumes passes outside the causal horizon @xcite .",
    "this choice has many virtues .",
    "first , we need to know statistical properties of the field fluctuations @xmath30 only around the time of horizon crossing , where they can be computed without the appearance of large logarithms @xcite .",
    "second , as a consequence of the slow - roll approximation , the @xmath31 are uncorrelated at this time , leading to algebraic simplifications .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 formula subsumes a gauge transformation from the field variables @xmath30 to the observational variable @xmath2 . using eqs .   , and",
    ", one finds that @xmath1 can be written to a good approximation @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and for simplicity we have dropped the ` @xmath8 ' which indicates time of evaluation .",
    "a similar definition applies for @xmath34 .",
    ".   is accurate up to small intrinsic non - gaussianities present in the field fluctuations at horizon exit . as a means of predicting @xmath1",
    "it is pleasingly compact , and straightforward to evaluate in many models .",
    "unfortunately , it also obscures the physics which determines @xmath35 . for this reason it is hard to infer , from eq .   alone , those classes of models in which @xmath35 is always large or small .",
    "is dynamically allowed .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "our strategy is quite different .",
    "we choose ` @xmath8 ' to lie around the time when we require the statistical properties of @xmath2 .",
    "the role of the @xmath0 formula , eq .  , is then to encode _ only _ the gauge transformation between the @xmath36 and @xmath2 . in ",
    "[ sec : derivative - n ] below , we show how the appropriate gauge transformation is computed using the @xmath0 formula . in the present section",
    "we restrict our attention to determining a formula for @xmath1 under the assumption that the distribution of field values on ` @xmath8 ' is known . in  [ sec : transport ] , we will supply the required prescription to evolve the distribution of field values between horizon exit and ` @xmath8 ' .",
    "although the @xmath31 are independent random variables at horizon exit , correlations can be induced by subsequent evolution .",
    "one must therefore allow for off - diagonal terms in the two - point function .",
    "remembering that we are working with a collection of spacetime volumes in real space , smoothed on some characteristic scale , we write @xmath37 @xmath38 does not vary in space , but it may be a function of the scale which characterizes our ensemble of spacetime volumes . in all but the simplest models it will vary in time .",
    "it is also necessary to account for intrinsic non - linearities among the @xmath31 , which are small at horizon crossing but may grow . we define @xmath39 likewise , @xmath40 should be regarded as a function of time and scale .",
    "the permutation symmetries of an expectation value such as   guarantee that , for example , @xmath41 .",
    "when written explicitly , we place the indices of symbols such as @xmath42 in numerical order . neglecting a small ( @xmath43 ) intrinsic four - point correlation , it follows that @xmath44    now we specialize to a two - field model , parametrized by fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 . using eqs .",
    " , and  , it follows that the two - point function of @xmath2 satisfies @xmath47 the three - point function can be written @xmath48 where we have identified two separate contributions , labelled ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' .",
    "the ` 1 ' term includes all contributions involving _ intrinsic _ non - linearities , those which arise from non - gaussian correlations among the field fluctuations , @xmath49 the ` 2 ' term encodes non - linearities arising directly from the gauge transformation to @xmath2 @xmath50 after use of eq .  ,",
    " can be used to extract the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this decomposes likewise into two contributions @xmath51 , which we shall discuss in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : numerics ] .      to compute @xmath1 in concrete models ,",
    "we require expressions for the derivatives @xmath52 and @xmath34 . for generic initial and final times , these are difficult to obtain .",
    "lyth & rodrguez @xcite used direct integration , which is effective for quadratic potentials and constant slow - roll parameters .",
    "vernizzi & wands @xcite obtained expressions in a two - field model with an arbitrary sum - separable potential by introducing gaussian normal coordinates on the space of trajectories .",
    "their approach was generalized to many fields by battefeld & easther @xcite .",
    "product - separable potentials can be accommodated using the same technique @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique has been proposed by yokoyama _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "a considerable simplification occurs in the present case , because we only require the derivative evaluated between flat and comoving hypersurfaces which coincide in the unperturbed universe . for any species @xmath27 , and",
    "to leading order in the slow - roll approximation , the number of e - folds @xmath6 between the flat hypersurface ` @xmath8 ' and a comoving hypersurface ` @xmath53 ' satisfies @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the field values evaluated on ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 , ' respectively . under an infinitesimal shift of @xmath57",

    "@xcite to an arbitrary potential .",
    "this contribution vanishes in virtue of our supposition that ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 ' are infinitesimally separated .    to compute @xmath60 it is helpful to introduce a quantity @xmath61 , which in the sum - separable case coincides with the conserved quantity of vernizzi & wands @xcite . for our specific choice of a two - field model , this takes the form @xmath62 where the integrals are evaluated on a single spatial hypersurface . in an @xmath63-field model , one would obtain @xmath64 conserved quantities which label the isocurvature fields .",
    "the construction of these quantities is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for sum - separable potentials one can show using the equations of motion that @xmath61 is conserved under time evolution to leading order in slow - roll .",
    "it is not conserved for general potentials , but the variation can be neglected for infinitesimally separated hypersurfaces .    under a change of trajectory ,",
    "@xmath61 varies according to the rules @xmath65 and @xmath66 the comoving hypersurface ` @xmath53 ' is defined by @xmath67 we are assuming that the slow - roll approximation applies , so that the kinetic energy may be neglected in comparison with the potential @xmath59 .",

    "is invariant under the exchange @xmath76 .",
    "in this section we return to the problem of evolution between horizon exit and the time of observation , and supply the prescription which connects the distribution of field values at these two times .",
    "we begin by discussing the single - field system , which lacks the technical complexity of the two - field case , yet still exhibits certain interesting features which recur there . among these features",
    "are the subtle difference between motion of the statistical mean and the background field value , and the hierarchy of moment evolution equations .",
    "moreover , the structure of the moment mixing equations is similar to that which obtains in the two - field case .",
    "for this reason , the one - field scenario provides an instructive example of the techniques we wish to employ .",
    "recall that we work in real space with a collection of comparably sized spacetime volumes , each with a slightly different expansion history , and the scatter in these histories determines the microwave background anisotropy on a given angular scale . within each volume",
    "the smoothed background field @xmath77 takes a uniform value described by a density function @xmath78 , where in this section we are dropping the superscript ` @xmath8 ' denoting evaluation of spatially flat hypersurfaces .",

    "this is the skewness , which we denote @xmath42 .",
    "a gaussian distribution has skewness zero , and inflation usually predicts that the skew is small .",
    "for this reason , rather than seek a distribution with non - zero third moment , as proposed in ref .",

    "it then ceases to be a probability density in the strict sense .",
    "this does not present a problem in practice , since we are interested in distributions which are approximately gaussian , and for which @xmath42 will typically be small . moreover , our principal use of eq .",

    "however , the second term shows that the centroid is also influenced as the wings of the probability distribution probe the nearby velocity field .",

    "above , if we are in a situation where @xmath105 , the tails of the density function are moving faster than the core .",
    "this means that one tail is shrinking and the other is extending , skewing the probability density .",
    "the opposite occurs when @xmath110 .",
    "these effects are measured by the second term in  .",
    "hence , by expanding our pdf to the third moment , and our velocity field to quadratic order , we are able to construct a set of evolution equations which include the leading - order source terms for each moment .      there is little conceptually new as we move from one field to two .",
    "the new features are mostly technical in nature .",
    "our primary challenge is a generalization of the moment expansion to two fields , allowing for the possibility of correlation between the fields . with this done ,",
    "we can write down evolution equations whose structure is very similar to those found in the single - field case .    the two - field system is described by a two - dimensional velocity field @xmath111 , defined by @xmath112 where again we are using the number of e - folds @xmath6 as the time variable .",
    "the index @xmath27 takes values in @xmath113 . while we think it is likely that our equations generalize to any number of fields , we have only explicitly constructed them for a two - field system . as will become clear below , certain steps in this construction apply only for two fields , and",
    "hence we make no claims at present concerning examples with three or more fields .",

    "it is helpful to pause and notice a complication inherent in eqs .   which was not present in the single - field case . to extract a hierarchy of moment evolution equations from the transport equation , eq .",
    ", we made the expansion given in   and argued that orthogonality of the hermite polynomials implied the hierarchy @xmath101 .",

    "the moment hierarchy would comprise linear combinations of the coefficients .",
    "the problem is essentially an algebraic question of gram ",
    "schmidt orthogonalization .    to avoid this problem",
    "it is convenient to diagonalize the covariance matrix @xmath119 , introducing new variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 for which eq .",
    "factorizes into the product of two measures under which the polynomials @xmath128 and @xmath129 are separately orthogonal .",

    "in addition , we have @xmath136    in order for eq .",
    "to be useful , it is necessary to express the skewnesses associated with the physical variables @xmath137 in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127 . by definition ,",
    "these satisfy @xmath138 after substituting for the definition of these quantities inside the expectation values in eq .",
    "we arrive at the relations @xmath139 the moments @xmath118 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 are time - dependent , but for clarity we will usually suppress this in our notation .",
    "next we must extract the moment hierarchy , which governs evolution of @xmath118 , @xmath140 , @xmath121 and @xmath40 .",
    "we expand the velocity field in a neighborhood of the instantaneous centroid @xmath118 according to @xmath141 where we have defined @xmath142 as in the single - field case , these coefficients are functions of time and vary with the motion of the centroid .",
    "the expansion can be pursued to higher order if desired .",
    "our construction of @xmath126 and @xmath127 implies that the two - field transport equation can be arranged as a double gauss  hermite expansion , @xmath143          =          p_g \\sum_{m , n \\ge 0 } c_{mn } h_m(x ) h_n(y )          =          0 .\\ ] ] because the hermite polynomials are orthogonal in the measure defined by @xmath116 , we deduce the moment hierarchy @xmath144    we define the  rank \" @xmath145 of each coefficient @xmath146 by @xmath147 .",
    "we terminated the velocity field expansion at quadratic order , and our probability distribution included only the first three moments .",
    "it follows that only @xmath146 with rank five or less are nonzero .",
    "if we followed the velocity field to higher order , or included higher terms in the moment expansion , we would obtain non - trivial higher - rank coefficients .",
    "inclusion of additional coefficients requires no qualitative modification of our analysis and can be incorporated in the scheme we describe below .    a useful feature of the expansion in eq .",
    "is that the rank-@xmath145 coefficients give evolution equations for the order-@xmath145 moments . written explicitly in components ,",
    "the expressions that result from   are quite cumbersome .",
    "however , when written as field - space covariant expressions they can be expressed in a surprisingly compact form .",

    "this    expresses the fact that the total probability is conserved as the    distribution evolves . : :    the rank-1 coefficients @xmath149 and @xmath150    give evolution equations for the centroid @xmath118 .",
    "these    equations can be written in the form @xmath151 we remind the    reader that here and below , terms like @xmath152 ,    @xmath153 and @xmath154 represent the velocity    field and its derivatives evaluated at the centroid    @xmath118 .",
    "the first term in expresses the non - anomalous    motion of the centroid , which coincides with the background velocity    field of eq .  .",
    "the second term describes how the wings of the    probability distribution sample the velocity field at nearby points .",
    "narrow probability distributions have small components of    @xmath119 and hence are only sensitive to the local value    of @xmath155 .",

    "these    can conveniently be packaged as evolution equations for the matrix    @xmath119 @xmath159 this equation describes the stretching and    rotation of @xmath119 as it is transported by the velocity    field .",
    "it includes a sensitivity to the wings of the probability    distribution , in a manner analogous to the similar term appearing in  .",
    "hence the skew @xmath40 acts as a source for the    correlation matrix .",
    ": :    the rank-3 coefficients @xmath160 , @xmath161 ,    @xmath162 and @xmath163 describe evolution of    the moments @xmath40 .",
    "these are    @xmath164 the first term describes how the moments flow    into each other as the velocity field rotates and shears the    @xmath165 coordinate frame relative to the    @xmath137 coordinate frame .",
    "the second term describes    sourcing of non - gaussianity from inhomogeneities in the velocity field    and the overall spread of the probability distribution .",
    "some higher - rank coefficients  in our case , those of ranks four and five  are also nonzero , but do not give any new evolution equations .",
    "these coefficients measure the  error \" introduced by truncating the moment expansion .",
    "if we had included higher cumulants , these higher - rank coefficients would have given evolution equations for the higher moments of the probability distribution .",
    "in general , all moments of the density function will mix so it is always necessary to terminate our expansion at a predetermined order both in cumulants and powers of the field fluctuation .",
    "the order we have chosen is sufficient to generate evolution equations containing both the leading - order behavior of the moments  namely , the first terms in eqs .  , and  and the leading corrections , given by the latter terms in these equations .",
    "at this point we put our new method into practice .",
    "we study two models for which the non - gaussian signal is already known , using the standard @xmath0 formula . for each case",
    "we employ our method and compare it with results obtained using @xmath0 . to ensure a fair comparison , we solve numerically in both cases .",
    "our new method employs the slow - roll approximation , as described above .",
    "therefore , when using the @xmath0 approach we produce results both with and without slow - roll simplifications .",
    "first consider double quadratic inflation , which was studied by rigopoulos , shellard & van tent @xcite and later by vernizzi & wands @xcite .",
    "the potential is @xmath166 we use the initial conditions chosen in ref .",

    "we plot the evolution of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which also shows the prediction of the standard @xmath0 formula ( with and without employing slow roll simplifications ) .",
    "we implement the @xmath0 algorithm using a finite difference method to calculate the derivatives of @xmath6 .",
    "a similar technique was used in ref .",
    "this model yields a very modest non - gaussian signal , below unity even at its peak .",
    "if inflation ends away from the spike then @xmath1 is practically negligible .",
    "shows that the method of moment transport allows us to separate contributions to @xmath1 from the intrinsic non - gaussianity of the field fluctuations , and non - linearities of the gauge transformation to @xmath2 . as explained in ",
    "[ ss : sep_universe ] , we denote the former @xmath170 and the latter @xmath171 , and plot them separately in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    inspection of this figure clearly shows that @xmath1 is determined by a cancellation between two much larger components .",
    "its final shape and magnitude are exquisitely sensitive to their relative phase .",
    "initially , the magnitudes of @xmath170 and @xmath171 grow , but their sum remains small .",
    "the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] arises from the peak of @xmath171 , which is incompletely cancelled by @xmath170 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath170 initially evolves in exact opposition to the gauge transformation , to which it is not obviously connected .    in the double quadratic model",
    ", @xmath1 is always small .",
    "however , it has recently been shown by byrnes _",
    "_ that a large non - gaussian signal can be generated even when slow - roll is a good approximation @xcite",
    ". the conditions for this to occur are incompletely understood , but apparently require a specific choice of potential and strong tuning of initial conditions . in figs .",

    "*  5 ) when we choose @xmath173 and initial conditions @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "it is clear that the agreement is exact .    in this model , @xmath1 is overwhelmingly dominated by the contribution from the second - order gauge transformation , @xmath171 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "this conclusion applies equally to the other large-@xmath1 examples discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , although we make no claim that this is a general phenomenon .    in conclusion , figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig3 ] show excellent agreement between our new method and the outcome of the numerical @xmath0 formula .",
    "these figures also compare the moment transport method and @xmath0 without the slow - roll approximation .",
    "we conclude that the slow - roll estimate remains broadly accurate throughout the entire evolution .",
    "non - linearities are now routinely extracted from all - sky observations of the microwave background anisotropy .",
    "our purpose in this paper has been to propose a new technique with which to predict the observable signal .",
    "present data already give interesting constraints on the skewness parameter @xmath1 , and over the next several years we expect that the _ planck _ survey satellite will make these constraints very stringent . it is even possible that higher - order moments , such as the kurtosis parameter @xmath176 @xcite will become better constrained @xcite . to meet the need of the observational community for comparison with theory , reliable estimates of these non - linear quantities will be necessary for various models of early - universe physics .",
    "a survey of the literature suggests that the ` conventional ' @xmath0 method , originally introduced by lyth & rodrguez , remains the method of choice for analytical study of non - gaussianity . in comparison ,",
    "our proposed moment transport method exhibits several clear differences .",
    "first , the conventional method functions best when we base the @xmath0 expansion on a flat hypersurface immediately after horizon exit . in our method , we make the opposite choice and move the flat hypersurface as close as possible to the time of observation . after this , the role of the @xmath0 formula is to provide no more than the non - linear gauge transformation between field fluctuations and the curvature perturbation .",
    "we substitute the method of moment transport to evolve the distribution of field fluctuations between horizon exit and observation .",
    "second , in integrating the transport equation one uses an expansion of the velocity field such as the one given in eqs .",
    ". this expansion is refreshed at each step of integration , so the result is related to conventional perturbative calculations in a very similar way to renormalization - group improved perturbation theory @xcite . in this interpretation ,",
    "derivatives of @xmath111 play the role of couplings . at a given order , @xmath177 , in the moment hierarchy",
    ", the equations for lower - order moments function as renormalization group equations for the couplings at level-@xmath177 , resumming potentially large terms before they spoil perturbation theory .",
    "this property is shared with any formalism such as @xmath0 which is non - perturbative in time evolution , but may be an advantage in comparison with perturbative methods .",
    "we also note that although @xmath0 is non - perturbative as a point of principle , practical implementations are frequently perturbative .",
    "for example , the method of vernizzi & wands @xcite and battefeld & easther @xcite depends on the existence of quantities which are conserved only to leading order in @xmath178 , and can lose accuracy after @xmath179 e - foldings .",
    "numerical calculations confirm that our method gives results in excellent agreement with existing techniques . as a by - product of our analysis",
    ", we note that the large non - gaussianities which have recently been observed in sum- and product - separable potentials @xcite are dominated by non - linearities from the second - order part of the gauge transformation from @xmath180 to @xmath2 .",
    "the contribution from intrinsic non - linearities of the field fluctuations , measured by the skewnesses @xmath40 , is negligible . in such cases",
    "one can obtain a useful formula for @xmath1 by approximating the field distribution as an exact gaussian .",
    "the non - gaussianity produced in such cases arises from a distortion of comoving hypersurfaces with respect to adjacent spatially flat hypersurfaces .",
    "our new method joins many well - established techniques for estimating non - gaussian properties of the curvature perturbation . in our experience , these techniques give comparable estimates of @xmath1 , but they do not exactly agree .",
    "each method invokes different assumptions , such as the neglect of gradients or the degree to which time dependence can be accommodated .",
    "the mutual scatter between different methods can be attributed to the theory error inherent in any estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "the comparison presented in ",
    "[ sec : numerics ] shows that while all of these methods slightly disagree , the moment transport method gives good agreement with other established methods .",
