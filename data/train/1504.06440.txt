    "though quantum entanglement is a concept which has attracted much of the attention of physicists working in various fields @xcite , still , there remains room for further progress on its understanding @xcite .",
    "one of the main open problems is the efficient detection and characterization of multipartite entanglement of density matrices representing open quantum systems undergoing non - unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "all experimentally addressable information about a quantum physical system is summarized in its density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "we focus on a multipartite quantum system , which comprises a finite number @xmath2 of parts @xmath3 numerated by index @xmath4 , each of which has the hilbert space of a finite dimensionality @xmath5 , whence @xmath6 is the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the entire system .",
    "this system assembly of parts , is called entangled ( or inseparable ) if and only if its density matrix can not be caste as a statistical sum @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 various ( @xmath11 ) direct products @xmath12 of the density matrices @xmath13 of pure states @xmath14 of each part .",
    "this condition provides the most general case of entangled systems opposite to a separable quantum system comprised of statistically independent elements , where eq.([eq0 ] ) holds as an equality .",
    "many approaches @xcite have been developed so far aiming to answer the question whether or not a density matrix is separable . concerning exact analytic results , up to now ,",
    "there is no method applicable to the multipartite problem , and we believe that such a solution does not exist at all . an algorithmic solution to the `` decision '' problem @xcite associated with separability has been conjectured to be a np hard problem but valuable progress has been done ( mainly on the bi - separability problem ) in approaches @xcite-@xcite where semidefinite programming is merged with analytic criteria @xcite .    in this work",
    "we provide a geometric point of view on the problem of inseparability that suggests an efficient solution based on linear programming . employing simple geometric arguments we suggest an algorithm that results to a _",
    "unique _ decomposition of the density matrix as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is , what we call in this work , the _ separable component _",

    "the best separable approximation _ of the density matrix @xmath1 . in that same seminal work ,",
    "the uniqueness of the decomposition has been proven for the multipartite case and a strict upper bound on the rank of the component @xmath23 for the biseparable case . in this work",
    "we generalize the latter to the multipartite case , proving that the rank of @xmath17 is upper bounded by a number related to the dimensions of the total system and those of the sub - elements .    on a practical level , we show that linear programming algorithm combined with a simple optimization technique allows one to efficiently find the decomposition of a generic density matrix @xmath24 with the coefficients constrained by the requirements @xmath25 when this limit is reached , the decomposition in eq.([eq1 ] ) yields eq.([one ] ) with @xmath26 : @xmath27 and @xmath28    is known that the linear programming method , in the general case , scales polynomially with the dimension of the vector space where it is applied . employing the fact that @xmath29 in eq.([eq1 ] ) , where @xmath30 is dimension of quantum assembly under study , we show that the proposed algorithm yielding the decomposition eq.([eq1 ] ) scales as @xmath31 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ a ] we introduce the idea of the decomposition eq.([one ] ) and illustrate its uniqueness with a simple geometric picture generalizing the bloch vector representation of a two - level system .",
    "this picture also helps us to analyze some properties of @xmath17 and we conclude this section with a theorem setting an upper limit on its rank . in section  [ b ]",
    "we present a version of an efficient linear programming algorithm allowing one to explicitly find the decomposition eqs.([eq1])-([eq2 ] ) for a generic density matrix . in section  [ c ]",
    "we suggest ideas for characterizing entanglement of the component @xmath17 which naturally reflects the entanglement properties of @xmath1 . in section  [ d ]",
    "we present a physical example which demonstrates the implementation of the technique introduced in previous sections and connects them with known notions in open quantum system dynamics .",
    "we conclude by the discussion in section  [ e ] .",
    "all possible density matrices of a quantum system with a hilbert space of dimension @xmath30 , are comprising a convex set of positive hermitian matrices of unit trace .",
    "this set can be viewed as a manifold in the vector space of hermitian matrices endowed with the a metric  the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the requirement of the unit trace in this representation means that the inner product of a vector representing a density matrix and a vector representing the unit matrix equals to unity .",
    "henceforth we call this manifold `` liouville vector space '' .",
    "furthermore , the density matrix of a pure state has rank one , which implies that the length of the vector corresponding to a pure state , equals to unity .",
    "the density matrix manifold is thus a convex hull at the unit - length length vectors having unit projection on the unity matrix .",
    "a natural basis exists for such a vector space suggested by the @xmath33 properly normalized generators @xmath34 of the unitary group @xmath35 , including the unity @xmath36 .",
    "this basis allows one to cast a @xmath37 density matrix of a quantum system as @xmath38 with @xmath39 $ ] the @xmath40 real vector components .",
    "this geometric picture is in direct analogy to the bloch vector for two - level systems .",
    "the pure quantum states lay at the surface of the unit hypersphere , @xmath41=\\sum_{i=0}^{n^{2}-1}r_{i}^{2}=1 $ ] , but in contrast to the bloch vector of @xmath42dimensional pure quantum states , these states do not cover all the surface of the hypersphere of dimension @xmath43 but are confined at a manifold of lower dimensionality , @xmath44 .",
    "this can be easily understood when the characteristic polynomial @xmath45=\\lambda ^{n}+c_{1}(\\left\\{r_{i}\\right\\ } ) \\lambda ^{n-1}+c_{2}(\\left\\{r_{i}\\right\\ } ) \\lambda ^{n-2}+\\ldots + c_{n}(\\left\\ { r_{i}\\right\\ } ) $ ] of a pure state is considered .",
    "the unit trace requirement ensures that @xmath46 , while the rank @xmath47 requirement implies the constraints @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the set of @xmath30 conditions on the @xmath40 components of the vector representing a pure state , constrains the vector to lay on a restricted manifold of lower dimension @xmath50 at the surface of the unit hypersphere . as a consequence",
    ", the density matrices for quantum systems of dimension @xmath51 do not ` fill ' the whole inner part of the unit hypersphere , but they are laying inside an @xmath52-dimensional body formed as a convex hull of the pure states of the @xmath50 dimensional manifold .",
    "this convex hull plays the role of the bloch ball for higher dimensions of the hilbert space and has been exhaustively studied in @xcite for the case of @xmath53-dimensional systems .",
    "the convex hull is touching the unit hypersphere only for the pure states while its outer hypersurface , which we denote by @xmath54 , is naturally the border between positive and non - positive hermitian matrices of unit trace . therefore @xmath54 consists only of the degenerate density matrices which have at least one zero eigenvalue . in fig.[fig1 ]  ( b ) we symbolically illustrate the convex hull of pure states , such that all density matrices are inside this body .",
    "the situation is similar for the convex hull formed exclusively by the pure product states .",
    "however since the product states is a manifold of measure zero in the set of all states , the convex hull of pure product states is located inside the convex hull of all pure states , apart from the points at the unit hypersphere corresponding to the pure product states . at the same time , the outer surface of the convex hull of product states does not separate positive from negative matrices , and hence it must not exclusively contain degenerate matrices . in fig.[fig1 ]  ( a ) we illustrate the situation symbolically by showing pure product states as points at the spherical surface and the convex hull of these points by a polytope inside the sphere . at the surface and inside the polytope",
    "the states are separable .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "( c ) we illustrate that inseparable states are the mixed states inside the body symbolizing the convex hull of pure states but are outside the polytope symbolizing the convex hull of the product states . in fig.[fig1 ]  ( e)-(f ) we illustrate the geometric meaning of eq.([eq1 ] ) , that each mixed state can be represented as a sum of separable state symbolized by the polytope within a scaled sphere of radius @xmath55 and an entangled state in the body within a scaled sphere of radius @xmath56 .",
    "in the situation where @xmath57 is minimum ( @xmath58 , eq.([one ] ) ) , the corresponding extremum states are at the surfaces of the polytope and the body , respectively , as shown in figs.[fig1 ]  ( e)-(f ) . obviously for a given a state",
    "such a decomposition is unique and the extremum state on the outer surface @xmath54 of the convex hull corresponds to essentially entangled component in eq.([one ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the properties of the essentially entangled component @xmath17 which , as it will be shown now , is a density matrix of rank @xmath59 strictly less than the dimension @xmath30 of the hilbert space of the entire system .",
    "the essentially entangled component belongs to the outer hypersurface @xmath54 of the convex hull of all states , but not every state on @xmath54 is an essentially entangled component ; only some of them which do not contain the separable part ( see fig.[fig1 ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "in addition , the eigenvectors of @xmath60 , @xmath61 of @xmath60 with @xmath62 , are necessarily @xmath20__-entangled _ _ pure states in the sense that these can not be written as direct product of @xmath20 pure states corresponding respectively to the @xmath20 subsystems",
    ". henceforth , we call pure states which are direct products of @xmath20 pure states of the @xmath20 subsystem , @xmath20__-product _ _ states .",
    "consider now the hilbert space @xmath63 of dimension @xmath59 , which is associated with the eigenvectors @xmath61 of @xmath17 .",
    "each state @xmath64 belonging to the hilbert space @xmath63 is apparently a linear combination of the eigenvectors , @xmath65 the vector @xmath64 can be also seen as a result of the action of an element @xmath66 of the unitary group @xmath67 associated with the hilbert subspace @xmath63 at one of the eigenvectors , @xmath68 now , let us consider the convex hull of the states @xmath64 of the subspace , which naturally contains @xmath17 .",
    "the condition that @xmath17 does not have any separable components , @xmath69 , implies that the convex hull does not contain a product state @xmath69 which is possible only if the hilbert space @xmath63 does not contain @xmath70 .",
    "we name a hilbert subspace with such a property an _ essentially entangled subspace _ of dimension @xmath59 and in what follows , with the help of this necessary condition , we find an upper bound on @xmath59 .",
    "the maximum rank @xmath71 of an essentially entangled component @xmath17 for a system of dimension @xmath30 comprised by @xmath20 subsystems each of them of dimension @xmath72 , is @xmath73 .",
    "let us assume that the essentially entangled component @xmath17 is a density matrix of rank @xmath59 , and consider the subspace @xmath63 which is spanned by its @xmath20-entangled eigenvectors @xmath74 .",
    "let us also consider the orthogonal compliment of the subspace @xmath63 , @xmath75 of dimension @xmath76 and arbitrary select a set of mutually orthogonal vectors @xmath77 spanning @xmath75 .",
    "the subspace @xmath63 is not essentially entangled , if there is at least one product state @xmath70 which can be expressed as in eq.([t1 ] ) , @xmath78 where @xmath79 s are complex numbers .",
    "equation ( [ gs ] ) implies that @xmath70 must be orthogonal to every element @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , of the chosen basis in @xmath75 , @xmath82 the maximum number of such conditions equals to the number of parameters defining a product state , which for a @xmath20-product state amounts to @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the maximum rank of an essentially @xmath20-entangled density matrix can not be equal or exceed @xmath83 .",
    "the maximum rank is smaller when we speak not about the essentially @xmath20-entangled component , but about the essentially entangled component which does not contain , not only @xmath20-product , but any product state .",
    "for this case one has to identify the bi - partition of the system that yields the maximum number of parameters characterizing the product state .    in the appendix we provide a more detailed proof of this theorem .",
    "if this theorem is applied to the case of @xmath42 qubits in mixed state , @xmath84 is obtained meaning that that the essentially entangled component can only be a pure entangled state .",
    "this result is in agreement with the results in @xcite where the bipartite case is treated .",
    "we would like to note , that the example studied in section  [ d ] gives some preliminary evidence that @xmath17 is prone to stay very near to pure states ( @xmath85\\approx1 $ ] ) even though @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "one can find the maximum separable and the essentially entangled components of an arbitrary density matrix straightforwardly with the help of the linear programming algorithm applied to the convex hull of general pure states and the `` polytope '' of pure separable quantum states .",
    "the main obstacle on this way is a high dimensionality of the corresponding liouville vector space , which makes intractable the direct approach within any approximation .",
    "in fact , even for the simplest multipartite system of three qubits , the dimensionality ( @xmath33 ) of the density matrix space is @xmath88 , such that even for the rather low - accuracy approximation attributing just @xmath89 points per dimension , one encounters a polytope of already @xmath90 vertices .    here",
    ", we suggest a way to crucially decrease the number of the vertices that enter as samples in the algorithm and , in consequence , the computational complexity of the procedure .",
    "we first notice the fact that the solution of the problem and , in general , any convex decomposition of the form eq.([eq1 ] ) , allows for at most @xmath33 non - zero coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ". this observation can be formally justified by a theorem of carathodory as mentioned in @xcite . in the limit @xmath93",
    "the pure states are the vertices associated with the corners of the facets corresponding to the solution , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( e)-(f ) , while other vertices can be discarded",
    ".    therefore , at first step we may randomly take @xmath94 product states , @xmath94 general states and in order to ensure the algorithmic stability , complement this set by the @xmath40 eigenvectors of the given density matrix .",
    "we find the solution of the linear programming problem , which typically has complexity @xmath95 , and thereby identify at most @xmath96 product states and @xmath97 general states with nonzero coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the linear constraint imposed on the algorithm is the minimization of @xmath98 and the solution provided is a ` local ' minimum , for the given set of vectors fed to the algorithm .",
    "our aim is to find the global minimum value of @xmath98 that is equal to @xmath18 and to this end we create an iterative optimization loop which guides us there .    at the second and subsequent steps ,",
    "we take the product states resulting from the solution of the optimization problem at the former step and by applying to each of them @xmath40 randomly chosen local transformations @xmath99 we generate @xmath100 new product states .",
    "we also generate new entangled states by applying random generic transformations @xmath101 to each of the entangled states obtained at the former step . here",
    "@xmath102 numerates generators of the @xmath35 group while @xmath103 mean generators of the subgroup of local transformation .",
    "random parameters and are normally distributed with width gradually decreasing with the number of the iteration step .",
    "we again solve the linear programming problem for @xmath104 vertices at these two new polytopes and iteratively repeat all the procedure till the result converges .",
    "note that each next step , the presence of the solution of the former step of the loop is essential in order to guarantee an outcome from the linear programming algorithm .",
    "the set of the eigenvectors of the density matrix plays this role for the first step .",
    "numerical inspection shows that the final results of the algorithm i.e. , the product component @xmath16 and the essentially entangled part @xmath17 , eqs.([sep])-([ent ] ) , are always the same for different runs .    the algorithm described above concerns the case of full separability of a state or else , the identification of the essentially @xmath20-entangled component .",
    "the same steps , can be applied if we make a repartition of the initial system and consider @xmath105-separability of the state with @xmath106 . furthermore ,",
    "if the set of separable states is enlarged to include other special classes of pure states e.g. states of the @xmath107 class @xcite , then one can apply the idea of the algorithm for revealing the classification of mixed multipartite entangled state as the one introduced in @xcite for three qubits .",
    "we would like to add here that for the specific case of three qubits in mixed state , a lot of progress has been recently made on the classification of entanglement via analytic criteria and efficient algorithms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "finally it is important to mention that linear programming scales polynomially with the dimension of the vector space under consideration in the general case but not always still a zero - measure of non - polynomial cases may exist . in consequence ,",
    "the same additional ` rule ' has to be applied to the proposed algorithm and the identification of the special cases where the algorithm becomes non - polynomial is an interesting open problem , not resolved in this work .",
    "however , on a practical level even in this case , a small random variation of the initial density matrix brings the problem back to a polynomially complexity .",
    "we may claim that all information relevant to entanglement is contained in the essentially entangled part @xmath17 of the density matrix .",
    "though this is not the main object of this work , we make some simple suggestions for analyzing entanglement properties of @xmath17 employing previous results @xcite about characterization of entanglement for pure states .    for pure quantum states ,",
    "entanglement is directly related to the factorizability at state vectors , and therefore one can characterize entanglement by identifying the orbit of local transformations for a given state .",
    "this orbit can be marked by a complete set of polynomial invariants or alternatively by the coefficients @xmath108 of the tanglemeter @xmath109 of a given state @xcite .",
    "the state defined as @xmath110 \\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle $ ] is the so called canonical state , and this can be reached from the state under study by the action of local operations under the constraint that the population of the reference state @xmath111 is maximized .",
    "in addition to the identification of the orbit of local transformations the tanglemeter generalizes the concept of logarithm to vectors and its coefficients straightforwardly reveal the factorization properties of the state .",
    "entanglement of mixed states can not rely only on one operation of group multiplication but it should also involve the procedure of casting in convex sums . therefore the algebraic structure does not suggest a natural framework for the characterization of entanglement in this case .",
    "construction of an approach to entanglement characterization is a convenience just complementing the exhaustive information contained in the essentially entangled part of the density matrix .",
    "a straightforward way to characterize entanglement of mixed states would be to find the tanglemeters of the eigenstates of @xmath112 .",
    "however , it does not mean that an entangled state corresponding to another orbit can not be detected .",
    "in fact , any pure state which belongs to the essentially entangled subspace @xmath63 spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath17 , is also a legitimate representative of the ensemble of entangled states associated with this density matrix .",
    "one therefore may want to find the `` corners '' of this ensemble of states by identifying the state @xmath113 in @xmath63 closest to the set of product states @xmath114 , followed by identification of a state @xmath115 closest to @xmath114 then , @xmath116 _ etc _ , till @xmath117 , and calculate tanglemeters for these `` corners '' .",
    "tanglemeter coefficients of any state in @xmath63 will therefore be within the borders given by these `` corners '' .",
    "we would like to mention here that the use of the tanglemeter as a method for characterizing multipartite entanglement is not essential here .",
    "one may apply this idea to other measures of multipartite entanglement for pure states as are the entanglement monotones from anti - linear operators introduced in @xcite .",
    "one more option is to find the tanglemeter coefficients distribution function @xmath118 resulting from averaging over the haar measure @xmath119 in the subspace @xmath63 in according with the eq.([t2 ] ) with weight suggested by @xmath17 , the probability to have canonic state with given tanglemeter coeficients .",
    "the number @xmath120 gives the probability density to find an entangled state which belongs to the orbit characterized by the set @xmath121 of the tanglemeter coefficients .",
    "in the case where one of the eigenvalues of @xmath17 is much larger than others , the probability distribution @xmath122 locates near the tanglemeter of the corresponding eigenvector and it can be adequately characterized by a small covariance matrix of the tanglemeter s coefficients .",
    "we now present an illustration of the introduced methods at a physical example of an open system experiencing loss of coherence due to presence of classical noise .",
    "the model comprises three elements : two two - level systems and a three - level system .",
    "the local symmetry group for each of two - level systems is the @xmath123 group , for the three - level @xmath124 group , while for the total assembly the group of transformations ( local and non - local ) is the @xmath125 .",
    "we consider the following physical ingredients of the combined system : an atom in @xmath126-state ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) in a static magnetic field , which parametrically interacts with a two - mode electromagnetic field .",
    "we also assume that each of the field modes allows for two possible polarizations of the photons .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system consists of four parts : + ( i ) the hamiltonian of the first field mode @xmath129 with wavevector @xmath130 and polarizations @xmath131 and @xmath132 , + ( ii ) the hamiltonian of the second mode @xmath133 with wavevector @xmath134 , + ( iii ) the hamiltonian of the atom @xmath135 in the static magnetic @xmath136 field , where @xmath137 the angular momentum vector operator , and + ( iv ) the hamiltonian describing the parametric interaction @xmath138 which results from the second order perturbation theory applied over the dipole interaction @xmath139 .",
    "+ here @xmath140 and @xmath141  are the photon creation operators of the first and the second mode , respectively , corresponding to polarization along the direction @xmath102 , while @xmath142 and @xmath143  are their conjugate photon annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "by @xmath144 and @xmath145 we denote the frequencies of the allowed dipole atomic transition from the state @xmath126 , that are closest to the frequencies of the first @xmath130 and the second @xmath134 photon modes , respectively .  the atomic optical electron radius - vector operator @xmath146 and the angular momentum vector operator @xmath147 enter the hamiltonian as the tensor product and the scalar products with the magnetic field , respectively , while the light velocity , the electron charge , and the planck s constant  are set to unity .",
    "since parametric interaction implies conservation of the total number of photons on the two modes , @xmath148 is an integral of motion for the system and only the hamiltonians @xmath149 and @xmath150 are responsible for the dynamical process of interest",
    ". the relevant part @xmath151 can be re - written in a more convenient way , noting that the @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath152 components of the vector - operator @xmath153 form an @xmath154 subalgebra of the symmetry algebra @xmath155 of the atomic triplet @xmath126 , while the operators @xmath156 and @xmath157 entering @xmath150 as the tensor product of the components of @xmath158 do not belong to this subalgebra and yield other generators of @xmath124 group .",
    "all these operators can be expressed in terms of gell - mann matrices @xmath159 with @xmath160 . moreover , the properly normalized bi - lineal photon operators @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 of the first mode form an @xmath154 algebra , and so do the similar operators of the second mode .",
    "therefore , these can be expressed in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively , with @xmath166 .",
    "summarizing , the hamiltonian @xmath151 can be caste in the form @xmath167 where the parameters @xmath168 depend on the static field , parameters @xmath169 and @xmath170 are governed by the detuning of the photon frequencies from the atomic transition frequencies , and parameters @xmath171 deviate from zero when the photon frequency turns to be dependent on the polarization in the presence of an anisotropicity of the refraction index ( that is when @xmath130 is slightly different for the @xmath131 and @xmath132 polarizations , and similar for @xmath134 ) .",

    "this picture also provides a complementary point of view on the phenomenon of sudden death and revival of entanglement @xcite . with the course of time",

    "[ fig2 ] .    in order to analyze the entanglement properties of the essentially entangled component we first note that for the chosen model system in the vast majority of the time steps , there is a dominant eigenvector @xmath195 for @xmath17 with a corresponding eigenvalue @xmath196 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( d ) .",
    "therefore , for this specific example and assigned parameters , it makes sense just to analyze entanglement properties of @xmath195 , whenever the condition @xmath196 is satisfied , and to conclude from this analysis the entanglement properties of @xmath17 .",
    "naturally , this analysis together with the weight @xmath187 , give all the information necessary to describe entanglement in @xmath197 .",
    "we analyze the entanglement properties of @xmath195 with the help of the method of nilpotent polynomials @xcite . in the appendix we provide an explicit method for deriving the general expression for the tanglemeter of a wavevector describing an assembly of a three - level system and two two - level systems : @xmath198 with @xmath199 being positive numbers and @xmath200 being complex .",
    "the matrix representation of the nilpotent variables ( operators ) @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 is also provided in the appendix .",
    "concerning now the physical meaning of the coefficients .",
    "the coefficients of the tanglemeter even though are not entanglement monotones @xcite in the strict sense , these are invariant under the action of local transformations and the presence of any non - zero term in the tanglemeter ensures the presence of entanglement .",
    "more precisely , the coefficient @xmath204 ensures the presence of genuine tripartite entanglement in the state while the rest of the coefficients are related to bipartite entanglement . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( e)-(h ) we plot those coefficients which are positive , and we observe that these oscillate with time without dissipation . the same holds for the real and imaginary parts of the complex ones not shown on the figure .    with this example , in addition to the death and revival of entanglement , we observe two interesting phenomena which need more case study in order to decide whether are specific to this example or general .",
    "the first is the presence of a dominant eigenvector in the essential entangled component and the second is the oscillations without dissipation of the entanglement characteristics of the essential entangled component .",
    "in this work we have studied a concept related to entanglement of mixed states namely the essentially entangled component of a mixed multipartite state and more important , we have suggested an efficient algorithm for its identification .",
    "the essentially entangled component is the complementary part to the best separable approximation introduced in @xcite and this naturally contains all the entanglement of the density matrix .",
    "we analyze some properties of the essentially entangled components and we suggest methods for characterizing its entanglement content .    our main tool is the accustomed geometric description of mixed quantum states in the spirit of bloch vector representation , which results from the decomposition of a density matrix over the generators of the relevant group . we have shown that pure states are not everywhere on the surface of this hypersphere , in the contract to the bloch vector , and that the convex hull of pure states from a convex `` body '' inside the sphere .",
    "the convex hull of separable states forms a convex `` polytope '' inside the `` body '' of general states . as a consequence",
    "the entangled states inside the body and outside the polytope can be represented as sum of a separable state on the surface of the polytope and an essentially entangled component located on the surface of the `` body '' .",
    "this geometric picture gives the guidance for constructing the algorithm and for analyzing the properties of the essentially entangled component .",
    "the latter being located on the surface of the `` body '' , form there sets of lower dimensions , such that the rank of the relevant density matrix does not exceed a number which depends on the dimensions of the total system , and on its chosen partition .    finally , at a particular example we study the dynamics of an open quantum system and we reconstruct the time trajectory of the decomposed density matrix inside the convex `` body '' .",
    "sudden death and sudden birth of entanglement can be seen as the results of crossing of the of the trajectory of the density matrix with the surface of the `` polytope '' of separable states .",
    "there are some other interesting phenomena appearing in this example but these still need further studies to lead to general conclusions .    concerning possible applications of the results .",
    "the algorithm introduced in this work scales polynomially with the dimension of the system in the general case , and it can be employed to study open questions about entanglement in mixed states .",
    "for instance , this can be applied straightforwardly to address the question of the relative volume of separable states over entangled mixed states as function of the total purity of the system and the total dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "an answer to this question can serve to the evaluation of emerging quantum technologies and their quantum limits .",
    "moreover , the essentially entangled component containing all entanglement properties of the density matrix may also provide new directions to entanglement detection @xcite and entanglement distillation @xcite techniques .",
