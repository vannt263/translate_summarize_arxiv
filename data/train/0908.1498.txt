    "given two independent multivariate iid samples @xmath6 with corresponding lebesgue densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , we are interested in identifying simultaneously subregions of the densities support where @xmath2 deviates significantly from @xmath3 at prespecified but arbitrarily chosen level @xmath7 . for this aim a multiple test of the composite hypothesis @xmath8 versus @xmath9 is proposed , built from a suitable combination of randomized nearest - neighbor statistics .",
    "the procedure does not require any preliminary information about the multivariate densities such as compact support , strict positivity or smoothness and shape properties , and it is valid for arbitrary finite sample sizes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the hierarchical structure of p - values for subsets of deviation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 provides insight into the local power of nearest - neighbor classifiers , based on the training set @xmath12 .",
    "thus our method is of interest in particular if the classification error depends strongly on the value of the feature vector , related to recent literature on classification procedures by belomestny and spokoiny ( 2007 ) .",
    "there is an extensive amount on literature concerning two - sample problems .",
    "most of it is devoted to the one - dimensional case as there exists the simple but powerful `` quantile transformation '' , allowing for distribution - freeness under the null hypothesis of several test statistics .",
    "starting from the classical univariate mean shift problem ( see e.g. hjek and @xmath13idk 1967 ) , more flexible alternatives as stochastically larger or omnibus alternatives have been investigated for instance by behnen , neuhaus and ruymgaart ( 1983 ) , neuhaus ( 1982 , 1987 ) , fan ( 1996 ) , janic - wrblewska and ledwina ( 2000 ) , and ducharme and ledwina ( 2003 ) .",
    "our approach is different in that it aims at spatially adaptive and simultaneous identification of local rather than global deviations . in the above cited literature asymptotic power",
    "is discussed against single directional alternatives tending to zero at a prespecified rate , typically formulated by means of the densities @xmath14 and @xmath15 corresponding to the transformed observations @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the mixed distribution function with density @xmath18 .",
    "note that the mapping @xmath17 coincides with the inverse quantile transformation under the null .    for power investigation of our procedure",
    "a specific two - sample minimax set - up is introduced .",
    "it is based on a reparametrization of @xmath19 to a couple @xmath20 , reducing the composite hypothesis `` @xmath4 '' to the simple one `` @xmath21 '' with the multivariate mixed density @xmath22 as infinite dimensional nuisance parameter .",
    "the reparametrization conceptionally differs from the above described transformation for the univariate situation as it can not rely on the inverse mixed distribution function .",
    "nevertheless it leads under moderate additional assumptions in that case to the same notion of efficiency . in order to explore the power of our method , the alternative is assumed to be of the form @xmath23 for fixed but unknown @xmath22 ,",
    "some suitably chosen ( semi-)norm @xmath24 , a constant @xmath25 and a given smoothness class @xmath26 .",
    "for any @xmath7 the quality of a statistical level-@xmath27-test @xmath28 is then quantified by its minimal power @xmath29 where the infimum is running over all couples @xmath19 which are contained in the set ( [ menge ] ) .",
    "it is a general problem that an optimal solution @xmath28 may depend on @xmath26 and @xmath22 .",
    "since the smoothness and shape of a potential difference @xmath30 are rarely known in practice , it is of interest to come up with a procedure which does not depend on these properties but is ( almost ) as good as if they were known , leading to the notion of minimax adaptive testing as introduced in spokoiny ( 1996 ) .",
    "note that here we have however @xmath22 as an additional infinite dimensional nuisance parameter .    the problem of data - driven testing a simple hypothesis is further investigated for instance by ingster ( 1987 ) , eubank and hart ( 1992 ) , ledwina ( 1994 ) , ledwina and kallenberg ( 1995 ) , fan ( 1996 ) and dmbgen and spokoiny ( 2001 ) among others , the two - sample context by butucea and tribouley ( 2006 ) .",
    "the idea in common is to combine a family of test statistics corresponding to different values of the smoothing parameters , respectively ; see , for instance , rufibach and walther ( 2008 ) for a general criterion of multiscale inference .",
    "the closest in spirit to ours is the procedure developed in dmbgen and spokoiny ( 2001 ) within the continuous time gaussian white noise model and further explored by dmbgen ( 2002 ) , dmbgen and walther ( 2008 ) and rohde ( 2008 ) , all concerned with univariate problems .",
    "walther ( 2010 ) treats the problem of spatial cluster analysis in two dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent section , a multiple randomization test",
    "is introduced , built from a combination of suitably standardized nearest - neighbor statistics .",
    "its calibration relies on a new coupling exponential bound and an appropriate extension of the multiscale empirical process theory .",
    "asymptotic power investigations and adaptivity properties are studied in section 3 , where the reparametrized minimax set - up is introduced .",
    "it is shown that our procedure is sharply asymptotically adaptive with respect to @xmath31-norm @xmath32 on isotropic hlder classes @xmath26 , i.e. minimax efficient over a broad range of hlder smoothness classes simultaneously . the application to local classification",
    "is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the one - dimensional situation is considered separately in section 5 where an alternative approach based on local pooled order statistics is proposed . in that case",
    "the statistic does not depend on the observations explicitly but only on their order which in contrast to nearest - neighbor relations is invariant under the quantile transformation .",
    "section 6.1 is concerned with a decoupling inequality and the coupling exponential bounds which are essential for our construction .",
    "both results are of independent theoretical interest .",
    "all proofs and auxiliary results about empirical processes are deferred to section 6.2 and section  6.3 .",
    "the procedure below is mainly designed for dimension @xmath33 .",
    "the univariate case contains a few special features and is considered separately in section [ sec : d=1 ] .",

    "the idea is to build up a multiple test , combining all possible local statistics @xmath55 .",
    "the typical way is to consider the distribution of the supremum @xmath58 , see , e.g. heckmann and gijbels ( 2004 ) .",
    "the problem is that the distribution is driven by small scales with a corresponding loss of power at larger scales , as there are many more small scales which contribute to the supremum . here",

    "these correction terms in the calibration aim to treat all the scales roughly equally .",
    "although the distribution of @xmath62 under the null hypothesis depends on the unknown underlying distribution @xmath4 , the conditional distribution @xmath63 of the above statistic is invariant under permutation of the components of the label vector @xmath64 . here and subsequently , the index `` @xmath65 '' indicates the null hypothesis , i.e. any couple @xmath19 with @xmath4 .",

    "an adequate calibration of the randomized nearest - neighbor statistics , i.e. the choice of smallest possible constants @xmath60 , requires both , an exact understanding of their tail behavior and their dependency structure .",
    "note that the randomized nearest - neighbor statistics have a geometrically involved dependency structure . even in case of the rectangular kernel @xmath28",
    "it depends explicitly on the `` random design '' @xmath35 which incomplicates the sharp - optimal calibration for multiple testing compared to univariate problems , where the dependency of the single test statistics remains typically invariant under monotone transformation of the design points .",

    "for details we refer to section [ sec : decoupling ] . in the typical case @xmath77",
    "we obtain @xmath78 .",
    "compared to results obtained for weighted averages of standardized , independent bernoullis , the above bernstein type appears to be nearly optimal , i.e. subgaussian tail behavior ( with leading constant @xmath79 ) is actually not present .    via inversion of the above exponential inequality , additive correction terms @xmath60 for adjustment of multiple testing are constructed .",

    "<S> based on two independent samples @xmath0 and @xmath1 drawn from multivariate distributions with unknown lebesgue densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , we propose an exact multiple test in order to identify simultaneously regions of significant deviations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the construction is built from randomized nearest - neighbor statistics . it does not require any preliminary information about the multivariate densities such as compact support , strict positivity or smoothness and shape properties . </S>",
    "<S> the properly adjusted multiple testing procedure is shown to be sharp - optimal for typical arrangements of the observation values which appear with probability close to one . </S>",
    "<S> the proof relies on a new coupling bernstein type exponential inequality , reflecting the non - subgaussian tail behavior of a combinatorial process . for power investigation of the proposed method a reparametrized minimax set - up </S>",
