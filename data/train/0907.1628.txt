    "finding direct evidence for cold dark matter ( cdm ) which may comprise @xmath1 of the cosmological energy density and the missing matter in galactic halos became a  holy grail \" for many experimental searches .",
    "there is also the exciting prospect that the weakly interacting massive particles(wimps ) denoted here by @xmath2 and @xmath3 comprising the cdm hail the new tev scale physics responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking .    in supersymmetry ( susy ) , technicolr and other scenarios beyond the standard model , the wimp masses",
    "are often in the 100 gev - tev mass scale and may manifest via energetic photons emerging from @xmath4 annihilations in overdense regions in our halo .    in some models",
    "the wimps are unstable and their decays produce energetic @xmath0 s .",
    "even long lifetimes consistent with the role of wimps as dark matter can then yield a non - negligible @xmath0 signal .    in the following",
    "we make some general and model dependent statements on the detectability of the these signals via their energy spectra and/or their directionality .",
    "we also address the question of using , at some future time , precise measurements of these signals to perform atomography \" reconstructing of the spatial wimp density distribution .",
    "in certain models ( see e.g ref . by us for decay and by ulio bergstrom , edso and gondolo for annihilation .. ) the wimp decay or annihilate with significant branchings into a photon and another stable particle or narrow resonance : @xmath5 in such cases the photon is almost monochromatic .",
    "more generically the annihilation / decay yields several particles including one ( or more ) photons .",
    "specific examples are the annihilation : @xmath6 or the decay : @xmath7 the @xmath0 signal in such cases is broad : @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( = 1/12 or 1/18 in the above examples ) is the average fraction of the initial mass in a photon . clearly it is a less striking signal than monochromatic @xmath0 s .",
    "yet the quick rise towards a multi - gev peak and subsequent fall to zero , expected here , are distinct from astrophysical signals which usually are monotonically decreasing , often with power like fall - off , and no sharp cut - off .    to date",
    "we have no evidence for wimp annihilation /decay yielding @xmath0 signals .",
    "indeed certain models with ( sommerfeld enhanced ) wimp annihilations accounting for possible deviations from standard astrophysical signals of electros /positrons are constrained by requiring that annihilations as in eq.2 above will not yield a corresponding enhanced photon flux from the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "discovering in future , more sensitive experiments , a monochromatic @xmath0 line in the 100 gev -tev mass range will practically establish wimps .    in the following",
    "we will assume that a monochromatic line or a multi - gev peak were found in the @xmath0 spectrum and tentatively associated with wimps .",
    "we generally expect that the directional distribution of such @xmath0 s will peak to varying degrees in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "conversely precise future measurements of the angular dependence of the wimp associated @xmath0 flux relative to the galactic center and the galactic plane provide a tomographic images of the wimp s density distribution .",
    "such mesurements allow finding @xmath10 , the density distribution of wimp s .",
    "the cases of @xmath0 s originating from annihilations / decays are rather different both phenomenologically and from the underlying physics points of view .    specifically , as we list below :    ( i ) .",
    "both annihilations and decays can occur in scenarios where wimp s are freeze -out remnants of cosmological early annihilations ( at times when the temperature t is about @xmath11 ) .",
    "it is however conceivable that dark matter arises , just like ordinary baryons , after efficient annihilations left only the excess of  matter \" ( say ) . by definition in such",
    " asymmetric \" scenarios we have no wimp annihilation at present .",
    "still if the  charge \" associated with this matter is , just like baryonic charge is not exactly conserved wimp decays are possible .",
    "baryonic decays are very slow ( @xmath12 years ) .",
    "however the situation can be different in  asymmetric \" wimp models .",
    "thus in a technibarionic analog  @xcite with technibaryon mass @xmath13 the decay rate , scaling as @xmath14 , may be @xmath15 years)@xmath16 , generating an observeable @xmath0 signal !    ( ii ) .",
    "wimp decays can occure also in symmetric wimp models such as those with slowly decaying gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "finally in all cases sufficiently strong wimp nuclear interactions allow direct observation via nuclear recoil in underground detectors .",
    "\\(iii ) for wimps decaying ( but _ not _ annihilating ) into @xmath0 s there is an amusing  cosmological echo \" of the  local \" signal from wimps decaying in the halo .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath0 fluxes are given by the line integrals of the density of wimps : @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the spurious similarity of the two fluxes suggests that both are jointly ( un)observeable .",
    "( the hubble expansion dilutes the cosmological flux from high red - shifts by @xmath19 .",
    "also the wimp mass density is @xmath20 gev/@xmath21 at our neighbourhood , falling at distances @xmath22 kpc from the galactic center at least as @xmath23 . )",
    "yet there are quite significant differences in energy spectrum and directional distribution which may allow resolving the two signals .",
    "the local signal originating from decays of halo wimps _ can _ be monochromatic as the doppler broadening due to the virial wimp velocities therein is of order @xmath24 only .",
    "this is not so for @xmath0 s from decays of cosmological wimps which are redshifted by a 1+z factor .",
    "also the cosmological signal is isotropic whereas due to the higher density of wimps towards the galactic center , the flux of @xmath0 s from their decay of is unisotropic , enhanced in the direction of the galactic center . for wimps decaying into @xmath25 bodies with only a peak in the spectrum the effect of the cosmological redshift",
    "is more difficult to ascertain .",
    "still a mild softening of the @xmath0 spectrum from directions further away from the galactic center may indicate the blending in of the cosmological component .",
    "\\(iv ) the signal due to wimp annihilation from any given direction is proportional to the line integral of the @xmath26 of the number density of wimps along that direction .",
    "thus unlike @xmath0 s from decays to which cosmological and haloe wimps make similar contri- butions , annihilating of haloe wimps dominate cosmological wimps by the ratio of wimp densities : @xmath27    further the much stronger variation of the volume emissivity as a function of @xmath28 , the distance from the galactic center generates a more pronounced unisotropy and enhanced flux from the galactic center than in the previouse case of decaying wimps .",
    "( v ) . for the exothermic annihilation process @xmath29 remains generally constant in the threshold region even as the relative velocity @xmath30 tends to zero .",
    "thus the rate of annihilations per unit time and volume ( and resulting volume emmisivity of photons ) which are proportional to @xmath31 is indeed proprtional to the square of the wimp number density as stated above .",
    "however in models with extra , light vectors ( or scalars ) ( termed @xmath32 bosons ) the annihilation of wimps is further accelerated by the  sommerfeld enhancement \" ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it introduces an extra factor of @xmath33 with @xmath34 the analog of the electromagnetic @xmath35 and for virial speeds @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be quite substantial .",
    "( the finite mass @xmath38 of the exchanged bossons provides an infrared cut - off saturating the cross - sections at @xmath39 ) .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement provides yet another preference for annihilations close to the galactic center where the slowest wimps tend to  sink \" to .",
    "simple energtics imply that : @xmath40 hence the velocity tends to decrease towards the galactic center and the sommerfeld enhancement increases therein .",
    "in all the three cases above there is a certain  profile \" @xmath41 of the annihilation rate and the ensuing @xmath0 volume emissivity .",
    "specifically we have @xmath42 for decaying wimps @xmath43 for annihilating wimps , and @xmath44 with @xmath45 the the avarage velocity defined by eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) above , if we have also somerfeld enhancement .",
    "it has been recently argued that while the overall wimp density @xmath46 with @xmath47 the distance from the galactic center is spherically symmetric , the velocity distribution is not .",
    "rather they suggest that the velocity distribution ( and ensuing source profile @xmath48 in case c above ) are modified by the disc and can no longer be spherically symmetric .",
    "the task tackle here is the reconstructing @xmath49 the from the angular distribution of the @xmath0 flux : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 defined in polar coordinates , the vector @xmath54 from us to the source point of interest and the @xmath55 and @xmath56 axes used in defining @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the direction to the galactic center and the ( rotation ) axis of the disc respectively and @xmath47 is the distance from the galactic center .    in principle this can be done also when @xmath57 is not spherically symmetric thereby inducing also an azimuthal @xmath53 angle dependence of the observed @xmath0 flux .",
    "consider first spherical profiles @xmath41 and fluxes @xmath58 depending on @xmath52 only . to map @xmath41",
    "to @xmath58 we integrate @xmath59 with @xmath60 from 0 to infinity along the line of sight to us ( the @xmath61 factor in the volume element @xmath62 cancels with the @xmath63 geometric divergence of the emitted @xmath0 s ) : @xmath64 with @xmath65 kpc our seperation from the galactic center and @xmath66 .",
    ".,width=377 ]    [ fig4 ]    rather than trying to invert that relation to express @xmath41 in termes of @xmath67 we use fig .",
    "1-a and fig .",
    "1-b to illustrate the situations for @xmath68 and for @xmath69 . in the first case and for @xmath70",
    "the fixed r circle is cut by the line of sight at an angle @xmath52 to the g.c.at two points @xmath71 .    in the second case",
    "there is always one such crossing at @xmath72^{1/2}$ ] since the initial mapping of @xmath41 to @xmath67 is linear in @xmath73 , the inverse mapping requires just the jacobian @xmath74 , with @xmath55 held fixed at @xmath75^{1/2}}$ ] , @xmath76 hence , by integrating next over @xmath77 we find that for @xmath78 : @xmath79 and for @xmath69 we have the same expression but with @xmath80 the magnitude .",
