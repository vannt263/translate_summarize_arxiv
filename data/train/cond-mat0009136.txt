    "the problem of magnetization reversal in a fine single - domain grain is of great importance in magnetic recording physics .",
    "characteristic reversal times under strong reversal magnetic field give a physical limitation to both data rates and system signal to noise ratio .",
    "dynamic magnetization reversal depends on the system or magnetic energy relaxation mechanisms .",
    "in addition to energy absorption to the `` thermal bath '' of the host lattice , magnetization reversal can occur by excitation of nonlinear ` spin - wave ' like modes . in the present paper we explore in detail the excitation of these modes in a quasi - single - domain particle .",
    "this magnetization reversal process exhibits features of several problems of nonlinear and solid state physics , such as kinetics of an orientational phase transition and energy transfer in nonlinear systems of oscillators .",
    "therefore the problem is of interest to fundamental science .",
    "dynamic magnetization reversal begins when the external magnetic field reaches and exceeds the so - called ` nucleation ' field and the original remanent state becomes unstable .",
    "typically these dynamical processes in both single and multidomain magnetic systems are solved by integration of the landau - lifshitz equations @xcite with phenomenological damping @xcite .",
    "this form of magnetization dynamics describes a coherent rotation of each discretized subgrain , in which the magnetization magnitude is conserved .",
    "such approximation is fair for small excitations , as in linear ferromagnetic resonance @xcite , or for some particular model cases when an excess of energy directly goes to the thermal bath without excitation of spin waves .",
    "recently we have explored magnetization reversal in quasi - single - domain grain by neglecting phenomenological damping and specifically exploring nonlinear spin - wave like magnetic excitations @xcite,@xcite . by quasi - single - domain we mean grains whose dimension is on the order of the domain wall width or in some cases the exchange length .",
    "similar analysis has also been done on reversal in thin films @xcite,@xcite . in all these cases , according to suhl s speculation @xcite , the switching process should be rapid , governed by nonlinear spin - wave excitations .",
    "recently spin - waves excitated by large magnetization rotations have been observed experimentally @xcite .    by neglecting phenomenological damping ,",
    "the total system magnetic energy is conserved .",
    "these simulations have demonstrated that the excess of zeeman energy is transformed to the exchange , anisotropy and magnetostatic energies by nonlinear spin - wave excitations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed study of magnetization reversal simulations focusing on magnetic interactions in a single grain .",
    "in addition , we describe here a new numerical scheme of solving the landau - lifshitz equations .",
    "typically numerical micromagnetic simulations invoke the three cartesian coordinates of each discretization cube . at each integration time",
    "step the magnetization is modified to satisfy the condition of constant magnitude .",
    "this scheme is preferable to utilization of the natural two - parameter polar coordinate scheme because of singularities . in polar coordinates",
    "there are always two singularities at the poles . in this new scheme",
    "we utilize two coordinates per magnetization sub - cube , however here these coordinates are similar to linear combinations of the transverse magnetization components . using a simple scheme ,",
    "all singularieties are avoided .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the micromagnetic model for our quasi - single - domain grain . in section 3",
    "we describe the implementation of our new numerical model . in sections 4 ,",
    "5 results of simulations are considered in detail .",
    "then we discuss obtained results and draw conclusions .",

    "fig.1 ) coupled cubic subgrains of the volume @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the linear size of sub - cube .",
    "each sub - cube can be characterized as a classical spin :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the vector magnetization of @xmath10th sub - cube , @xmath11 is plank s constant and @xmath12 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",

    "each spin is localized in the center of its sub - cube .",
    "the characterization of each sub - cube magnetization in terms of an effective spin is our choice : the problem we consider is purely classical .",

    "we shall study the problem of time evolution of the normalized total magnetization @xmath36 in the system ( [ hamiltonian ] ) from the initial state when @xmath26 and the averaged magnetization at @xmath37 is oriented `` upward '' in the @xmath35 direction . at the moment",
    "@xmath38 , a strong reversal magnetic field @xmath39 is applied .",
    "the component @xmath40 is negative and the transverse component @xmath41 is taken to be relatively small ( @xmath42 to reduce .",
    "mathematically the question of energy transfer is described in appendix b.",
    "the landau - lifshitz equation without damping in terms of classical spin ( [ classspin ] )  can be written as @xmath43 this equation describe the evolution of coupled spin components @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as time evolves , eqs.([merm - ll]),([efffield ] ) give two system conservations : the net spin of each subgrain is fixed    @xmath46    and the total magnetic energy remains constant .",
    "thus only two independent variables exist for each @xmath31-th site .",
    "it is natural to write down only two differential equations for each spin in terms of spin components or other generalized variables .",
    "the most popular form of `` two - variable '' landau - lifshitz equation is known to be in spherical coordinates .",
    "however the use of spherical coordinates for an arbitrary motion of spin gives a stiff system of differential equations with singularities at the poles .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations of trigonometric functions typically take much longer time than simple arithmetic operations .",
    "this is why the spherical coordinate approach is not usually used in micromagnetic calculations . in practice the direct method of numerical solution of the landau - lifshitz equation",
    "is used ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "dynamic equations for all three variables are integrated with continuum numerical modification so that the eq .",
    "( [ spin2 ] ) is maintained .    in this paper",
    "we present a new scheme for numerical solution of the landau - lifshitz equation ( [ merm - ll ] ) , in which only two variables are utilized and condition ( [ spin2 ] ) is automatically maintained .",
    "we introduce the real and dimensionless variables @xmath47 ( as a generalized coordinate )  and @xmath48 ( as a generalized momentum ) as follows @xmath49 these transformations are exact and can be considered to be a form of classical holstein - primakoff @xcite transformation ( see appendix ) .",
    "schlmann @xcite also presented a classical spin in a similar form .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the exact analog of the landau - lifshitz equations ( [ merm - ll ] ) and can be written in the form    @xmath50    where a dimensionless time @xmath51 is introduced .",
    "corresponding spin derivatives are    @xmath52    it is necessary to mention that eqs.([q1-ll ] ) , ( [ p1-ll ] ) contain a singularity at @xmath53 . to avoid this singularity",
    "we shall use ( [ q1-ll ] ) , ( [ p1-ll ] ) only in the hemisphere @xmath54  with @xmath55 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.2 . following eq.(5 )",

    "@xmath68  we find @xmath69 and@xmath70 and calculate corresponding @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . if @xmath60 , we continue integration of the landau - lifshitz equations with @xmath59 and@xmath74 . in the case",
    "when @xmath75 , the @xmath10th spin trajectory crosses the equator and enters the upper hemisphere . to avoid the singularity in the @xmath59 and@xmath74 coordinates in the upper pole ( see fig.2 ) , the new variables @xmath48 and @xmath47 are introduced by eq.([qp - qp ] ) .",
    "integration of the landau - lifshitz equations using @xmath76 and @xmath47 until the @xmath35-component of the spin changes sign ( @xmath77 ) . at that point",
    "we change back to the @xmath59 and@xmath74 coordinates .",
    "it should be noted that the eqs.([q1-ll ] ) , ( [ p1-ll ] ) , ( [ q2-ll ] ) and ( [ p2-ll ] ) have simple algebraic operations only and therefore numerical integration of these equations do not contain time consuming operations .",
    "a characteristic time scale of the system is @xmath78 .",
    "the role of exchange interaction is defined by the parameter @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the exchange field from the nearest neighbor .",
    "one can write    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the domain wall width , @xmath83 is the linear sample size .",
    "the exchange interaction energy can also be characterized by , so - called , `` exchange length '' @xmath84 .",
    "therefore one can write @xmath85    we shall focus on the case of relatively strong uniaxial anisotropy when @xmath86 ( which is valid for real magnetic recording grains ) . in the zeroth order of this small parameter we can neglect the dipole - dipole interaction in the system .",
    "however as it will be demonstrated in the next section that even relatively small dipole - dipole interaction , which absorbs very small amount of the zeeman energy plays an important role in the magnetization reversal .",
    "the system of landau - lifshitz equations has been numerically solved for @xmath87 .",
    "high - accuracy solutions to these ordinary differential equations were obtained with minimal computational effort by utilizing the bulirsch - stoer method with adaptive stepsize control @xcite .",
    "integration steps  were about four orders less than the characteristic time @xmath88 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ q1-ll ] ) , ( [ p1-ll ] ) , ( [ q2-ll ] ) , ( [ p2-ll ] ) contain relative parameters only . for simulations these parameters",
    "were chosen to correspond to real magnetic recording media .",
    "for example , with @xmath89 erg / cm , @xmath90 koe and @xmath91 oe , the scaled parameters are @xmath92 nm , @xmath93 nm and @xmath94 .",
    "nonlinearities can only be excited were there are deviations in the magnetization state from perfect alignment .",
    "we include this by allowing the system to initially be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we assign randomly a total energy deviation of @xmath95 .",
    "practically we randomly deviate the magnetization of each cell within a fixed limit .",
    "this limit is adjusted to achieve the above total energy deviation . to obtain a true thermal equilibrium the landau - lifshitz equations",
    "are solved , given the above initialization , for a time @xmath96 . at this point",
    "the system is prepared for the application of the reversal field .",
    "first we shall consider the case when the dipole - dipole interactions in @xmath97 ( [ efffield ] ) are neglected .",
    "fig.3a , b show the time dependencies of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the case when the reverse magnetic field has a very small deviation from the anisotropy axis ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "fig.3b is simply an extension of the time axis of fig.3a .",
    "the field magnitude is slightly less than the nucleation field for uniform rotation ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "this field corresponds ( by numerical test ) to the lowest reverse field required to produce nonlinear excitations .",
    "the sample dimension is 16% and 25% greater than the domain wall width and exchange length , respectively .",
    "initially the longitudinal component of magnetization decreases monotonically from @xmath102 to @xmath103 and then at a ` critical ' time @xmath104 , oscillations of @xmath105 occur . in contrast , the net magnitude of magnetization remains practically constant @xmath106until @xmath107 and then abruptly decreases exhibiting irregular oscillations . for times less than @xmath107 the average magnetization simply precesses about the reverse field . for times greater @xmath107",
    "the excitation of nonlinear spin waves becomes pronounced .",
    "these excitations both absorb zeeman energy and reduce the magnetization .",
    "this behavior is typical of nonlinear spin - wave processes whose amplitudes grow exponentially from an initial thermal level .",
    "the decrease in net magnetization becomes observable at virtually a critical time @xmath107  when the magnetic moment of the ( transverse ) excited waves becomes comparable with the net magnetic moment . at the same time",
    "the system nonlinearities restrict the exponential growth .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath105 that occur for @xmath108 primarily correspond to the uniform rotation : the frequency increases with decreasing @xmath105 .",
    "if spin - wave excitations did not occur , oscillations in @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath105 would reflect uniform rotation only and at every instant sum to give constant @xmath106 .",
    "with increasing time the average @xmath105 continually decreases reaching , for this example an asymptotic level in the vicinity of @xmath111 ( at least for times less than @xmath112 ) .",
    "there is no reversal of @xmath113 .",
    "the average magnetization @xmath99 also decreases by about @xmath114 . as time proceeds ,",
    "the spin - wave oscillations exhibit increased chaotic behavior .",
    "fig.4 shows similar time dependences as in fig.3 but for the case of increased angle of the reverse magnetic field from the anisotropy axis ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the field magnitude ( @xmath116 ) also corresponds to the onset of spin - wave excitation .",
    "as expected , the magnetization dynamics is much faster in this case .",
    "we can see the beginning of nonlinear spin - wave excitation at @xmath117 , where the @xmath105 has reduced due to pure rotation to @xmath118 .",
    "the decrease of longitudinal magnetization is more substantial , passing through zero at @xmath119 and reaching about @xmath120 of its nominal value in the opposite direction after @xmath121 .",
    "similar to the case shown in fig.3 , the average magnetization @xmath99 decreases to @xmath122 .",
    "note that the amplitudes of chaotic oscillations of @xmath99  are relatively smaller than in the case of fig.3 ( compare the long time behavior of fig.3b and fig.4b ) . here",
    "most of the zeeman energy is transformed into high frequency exchange - dominant spin - wave modes , which have relatively small magnetic moments .    as discussed earlier",
    ", the total magnetic energy remains constant in these dynamic processes .",
    "in fig.5a , b we plot the evolution of the zeeman , exchange and anisotropy energies ( fig.5b is an extended scale of fig.5a ) .",
    "the reverse angle is intermediate between fig.3 and 4 . initially ,",
    "for times less than @xmath123 ( in this case @xmath124 ) , uniform rotation yields a decrease of the zeeman energy and an increase of the anisotropy energy . at the onset of nonlinear spin - wave excitation",
    "we see , in addition , an increase of the exchange energy .",
    "the wave - like nature of these excitations can be seen in fig.5a in the beating of the exchange and anisotropy energies .",
    "the nonlinear excitation of chaotic oscillations of the magnetization can be thought of as an `` overheating of the magnetic system '' .",
    "the more exchange magnetic modes that are involved in the process , the smaller the averaged magnetization @xmath99 .    fig.6a - d demonstrate the time dependencies of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for various magnetic fields : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . as in fig.5 the field angle is fixed at @xmath129 and relative sizes are unchanged . for this angle",
    "the stoner - wohlfarth nucleation field is @xmath130 . in this case",
    "the onset field for nonlinear spin - wave excitation is @xmath131 = @xmath132 .",
    "there is no reversal below this field as shown in fig.6a .",
    "the magnetization evolution at the onset field is shown in fig.6b ( similar to figs.3,4 ) .",
    "magnetization dynamics for larger fields are shown in figs.6c , d .",
    "a notable features can be seen : the critical time for nonlinear spin - wave excitation increases with increasing field .",
    "the increase of @xmath107 allows for several cycles of uniform rotation to occur prior to the nonlinear spin - wave excitation .",
    "no reversal dynamics was observed  beyond @xmath133 ( in this particular case ) .",
    "essentially as the reverse field is increased beyond the spin - wave onset field , @xmath107 rapidly increases and becomes infinite .",
    "these phenomena also occur for other field angles ( @xmath134 ) .    as indicated in figs.6a - d the asymptotic , long time value of @xmath105 increases with increasing applied field ( i.e. less magnetization reversal occurs ) . in fig.7",
    "we explicitly plot the asymptotic values of averaged @xmath135 and @xmath136 versus applied field .",
    "it should be noted that the excitation of nonlinear spin waves occurs only for a narrow band of applied fields .",
    "fig.8 shows the evolution of magnetization at various sample sizes .",
    "we see that a decrease of the sample size relative to the domain wall width leads to a suppression of magnetization reversal .",
    "this fact is also can be interpreted in terms of nonlinear spin - wave processes . by decreasing the sample size",
    ", we increase the frequencies of the non - uniform spin - wave modes and therefore restrict the number of resonance nonlinear processes that can contribute to a decay of the uniform mode .",
    "analysis for larger sample would require finer discretization .",
    "in this section we show numerical simulations that include the dipole - dipole interactions in @xmath137 ( [ efffield ] ) .",
    "the relative role of dipole - dipole interaction is small because we assume a small magnetostatic parameter @xmath138 . in this case",
    "we can not expect a noticeable absorption of the zeeman energy solely by the dipole - dipole reservoir .",
    "nevertheless , the dipole - dipole interaction plays an important role in the process of energy transfer : it reduces the symmetry of the system and therefore opens new channels of nonlinear spin - wave interactions .",
    "let us compare the results of fig.3 obtained without dipole interaction and corresponding results in fig.9 with the dipole interaction .",
    "the onset time @xmath123 of nonlinear excitation is about the same .",
    "however @xmath98 decreases more rapidly , reverses and reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath139 .",
    "this is in contrast to fig.2 where the asymptotic @xmath98 does not reverse . in this case",
    "the average magnetization @xmath99 decreases to @xmath140 , slightly more than the @xmath122 in fig.3 .",
    "the amplitudes of chaotic oscillations of @xmath99 in this case are much smaller than occur in fig.3 .",
    "the excess zeeman energy is transformed into exchange modes , which have smaller magnetic moments .",
    "plotted in fig.10 is the magnetization dynamics for a larger field angle ( @xmath115 ) . as compared with fig.4 ,",
    "including magnetostatic interactions slightly increases the reversal rate .",
    "the longitudinal magnetization passes through zero at @xmath141 and , similar to fig.4 , reaches about @xmath120 of its nominal value in the opposite direction after @xmath142 .",
    "the average magnetization @xmath99 is decreased to @xmath122 .",
    "fig.5c , d demonstrate typical transformations of zeeman , anisotropy and exchange energies for short ( c ) and long ( d ) time intervals for magnetization dynamics with dipole interactions .",
    "we see faster dynamics of energy transformations than shown in fig.5a , b .",
    "it should be noted that the energy absorbed by dipole interactions is relatively small ( within @xmath143 in relative units ) as expected and therefore not shown .",
    "however the magnetostatic interactions change the balance the exchange and anisotropy energies .    in fig.11",
    "are shown the time dependencies @xmath98 and @xmath99 for various reversal fields . in agreement with fig.6 ,",
    "the reversal dynamics is suppressed with increasing the strength of reversal field but the range of reversal dynamics is much broader .",
    "we did not observe any reversal dynamics at @xmath144 in this particular case .",
    "we believe that the @xmath145 discretization is not a major limiting factor . for the case of @xmath146",
    "subgrains no reversal dynamics was observed at @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "in fig.12 we plot the asymptotic relative change in zeeman energy @xmath148 versus the applied magnetic field for the parameters of fig.11 ( solid dots ) . even though there is less asymptotic magnetization decrease as the field",
    "is increased , the relative change in zeeman energy does increase .",
    "after the onset of nonlinear spin - wave excitation , in this case at @xmath149 , the amount of spin - wave energy that can be excited increases to a maximum value .",
    "in addition ( open dots ) , the change in zeeman energy is plotted corresponding to fig.5 . for the case of no magnetostatic interaction .",
    "the same trend occurs but only over a small interval of field values .",
    "fig.13 shows the evolution of magnetization at various sample sizes . as in fig.8 ,",
    "the decrease of the sample size relative to the domain wall width leads to a suppression of magnetization reversal .",
    "the minimum size for spin - wave excitation remains the same , however differences are seen in the amplitude of the chaotic excitations .",
    "we have also examined the effect of grain size relative to the exchange length at fixed relative domain wall size ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the system evolution is more sensitive to the change of exchange length if the dipole - dipole interaction is taken into account .",
    "the primary effect is that with a smaller relative exchange length the rate of decrease of the average magnetization is faster .",
    "as discussed above , the presence of magnetostatic interactions allows the excitation of additional spin - wave modes that were otherwise degenerate .",
    "these modes are more easily excited if the sample size is large compared to the exchange length .",
    "magnetization reversal occurs by reducing the zeeman energy as the magnetization goes from an initial high energy state to one of low energy ( approximately in the field direction ) .",
    "typically this dynamic process is analyzed using the landau - lifshitz equation with an appropriate phenomenological damping term .",
    "here we have excluded phenomenological damping and shown that substantial , rapid reversal can occur . in this case",
    "the total magnetic energy is conserved , however subject to constraints of sample size and field range , the zeeman energy is reduced by the excitation of nonlinear spin - waves .    in the present study we have specifically focused on a cubic grain sufficiently small to be almost single domain . in this case after uniform rotation over a short time period ,",
    "nonlinear spin waves are excited and the average grain magnetization decreases . for the sample sizes examined here the reduction was from positive saturation ( @xmath151 ) to at most , @xmath152 . due to numerical limitations",
    "we did not examine large grains and it is possible that , with sufficient discretization , almost complete reversal might occur for samples much larger than the domain wall width . in this study we considered only samples with small relative magnetostatic energy contribution .",
    "studies have been performed on high moment low anisotropy thin films , where a large out of plane magnetization reversal torque occurs @xcite,@xcite . in these cases",
    "virtually complete reversal almost always occurs with no phenomenological damping .",
    "the decrease and suppression of magnetization reversal with increasing the reversal field strength initially seem unusual . in the discussion of fig.11 a limit",
    "is suggested as due to the saturation of the spin - wave energy .",
    "however , the problem we consider is a general system of nonlinear oscillators ( nonlinear spin waves ) . in the oscillator problem",
    "one mode ( here corresponding to coherent rotation of the magnetization ) is  initially strongly excited .",
    "one might expect that the system would move towards its most probable state ( thermal equilibrium ) by a chaotic mode mixing . with any large reverse field",
    "we would expect reversal to a new equilibrium state .",
    "however , the observed reversal decreases and suppression can be qualitatively understood as a result of nonlinear spin - wave interactions .",
    "the processes of nonlinear spin - wave decay are defined by several factors .",
    "first , it is necessary that the frequency of the initial mode and some portion of the nonlinear spin - wave spectrum overlap .",
    "second , we require sufficiently strong nonlinear interwave coupling .",
    "these factors determine a threshold amplitude of the decaying wave ( as an effective pumping field ) .",
    "third , the amplitude of initial ( decaying ) wave must exceed a threshold value .",
    "when the reversal field strength is increased , all these three requirements eventually are not met . as suggested in ref.@xcite , increasing the reverse field shifts the spin - wave spectrum away from the uniform precession mode . also as the reversal field is increased nonlinear coupling decreases . at a certain reversal field",
    "the threshold of nonlinear decay will exceed the amplitude of coherent magnetization rotation and the reversal process will be suppressed .",
    "generally speaking , such a suppression of the energy transfer from the excited mode to other modes is a common feature of the theory of hamiltonian systems of nonlinear oscillators ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the most simple and popular example of nonlinear coupled oscillators is the fermi - pasta - ulam chain ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "the numerical scheme we have presented is valuable here primarily because the number of coordinates is reduced by 2/3 .",
    "thus , the computational storage requirement is correspondingly reduced .",
    "however , there is an additional advantage to this formulation .",
    "these coordinates correspond naturally to nonlinear oscillators that describe spin - wave motions .",
    "recently , the problem of thermally agitated reversal has been analyzed  in a micromagnetic grain . using this nonlinear oscillator representation a simple exact solution has been obtained for the first passage time @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "magnetization reversal in a quasi - single - domain grain can occur by nonlinear spin - wave excitation . in this process",
    "an excess of zeeman energy is transfered to uniaxial anisotropy and exchange energies .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction plays an important role even if small ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "the process of magnetization reversal in a fine grain exhibits general features of system of interacting oscillators : energy transfer by nonlinear resonance processes .",
    "this nonlinear process ( diffusion ) is forbidden for either a strong reversal field and/or a small grain size .",
    "we have presented a new scheme to perform numerical integration of the landau - lifshitz equations .",
    "this new scheme utilizes only two variables per discretization cell , but strictly conserves the magnetization magnitude .",
    "comparison with conventional techniques show that both schemes require approximately the same computation time at the same level of accuracy ( the new scheme takes a slightly shorter time ) .",
    "the main advantage of the new scheme is that it utilizes a smaller number of variables ( 2/3 of the total magnetization components ) and therefore requires less memory .",
