    "john nash has proved in 1950  @xcite using kakutani fixed point theorem that any @xmath0-player normal - form game  @xcite has at least one equilibrium . in the game",
    ", each player has only a finite number of actions to take and takes one strategy at action playing .",
    "if a player takes one of the actions in a deterministic way , it is called a pure strategy .",
    "otherwise , if a player takes anyone of the actions following some probability distribution defined on the actions , it is called a mixed strategy . at a nash equilibrium",
    ", each player has chosen a strategy ( pure or mixed ) and no player can benefit by unilaterally changing his or her strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged .",
    "nash equilibrium is arguably the most important concept in game theory , which has significant impacts on many other fields like social science , economy , and computer science .",
    "it is an important theory for understanding a common scenario in game playing .    in a nash equilibrium ,",
    "each player s strategy is completely selfish because the player is only interested in maximizing his own payoff .",
    "only the best action(s ) to each player is accepted by the player , sub - optimal actions are not considered at all . the best action is defined as the one with the highest payoff . as a consequence of the selfishness , even if the payoff of a sub - optimal action is slightly less than the best one , the probability of picking this sub - optimal action by the player is still zero .",
    "however , many cultures teach people to be less selfish in a society .",
    "also , the scenario of less - selfish players may be closer to reality , such as individuals in human societies or animal kingdoms .",
    "our conventional wisdom tells us that if each of us gives away a bit more in favor of others , we could end up with more gains as return .",
    "that is , reduced selfishness leads to better payoffs for the individuals in a society .",
    "for instance , if we , as drivers , respect other drivers sharing the same road and give considerations for each other either voluntarily and/or by following traffic laws , then each of us will end up with a faster , safer drive to his / her destination than the case when everyone is only interested in maximizing his own speed to his destination .",
    "this paper presents both experimental results and theoretical investigation to show that , if the individuals in a society reduce their selfishness by simply accepting sub - optimal actions in some degree , a new equilibrium can be reached where better payoffs and social stability are obtained at the same time .",
    "the first key observation of this paper is that , reducing selfishness can improve payoffs .",
    "when completely selfish players at a nash equilibrium reduce their selfishness , they will shift to a new equilibrium with payoffs possibly better than the original one .",
    "the observations will range from the classic prisoner s dilemma , a hard game used in other game theory literatures , to computer generated games with hundreds to thousands of players .",
    "it verifies the conventional wisdom that reducing selfishness could lead to better payoffs for everyone .",
    "the second key observation is that , reducing selfishness can also improve social stability .",
    "a society of completely selfish individuals can be very sensitive to perturbations , the accuracy at representing individuals utility functions , and communication errors among the individuals in the society .",
    "the smallest change in utility function or the slightest communication error could knock the individuals out of their existing equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , a society of completely selfish individuals can have an enormous number of equilibria .",
    "the number may increase exponentially with the population of the society , the society could end up with one nash equilibrium or another , depending on the initial conditions and sensitive to perturbations . if the individuals reduce their selfishness together , they can reduce their sensitivity to perturbations , inaccuracy in utility functions , and communication errors . at the same time , the number of equilibria tends to drop significantly so that the outcome of the society can be more predictable .",
    "when the selfishness is below a certain level , the society tends to have only one equilibrium and converges to it with any initial conditions .",
    "in particular , this paper gives a mathematical model for describing selfishness .",
    "the level of selfishness is controlled by one parameter of the model to cover the spectrum ranging from complete selfishness to complete selfishlessness . with the parameterized selfishness model ,",
    "this paper offers a generalization of nash equilibrium together with a proof of the existence of an equilibrium given any selfishness level using a fixed point theorem .",
    "it is a generalization because this paper offers a proof to show that a generalized equilibrium at the particular case of completely selfish players falls back to a nash equilibrium . in other words ,",
    "the definition of nash equilibrium is a special case of the generalized one .",
    "it is important to note that the generalization is constructive because it defines a protocol for the players in a game to interact with each other so that an equilibrium can be reached with any selfishness level .",
    "an @xmath0-player normal form game is defined as :    * @xmath0 players @xmath1 ; * each player @xmath2 has a finite set of strategies @xmath3 .",
    "strategies are also called actions .",
    "the cartesian products of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is called the set of the pure strategy profiles ( the set of action tuples ) . *",
    "each player has a utility function defined as a real value function @xmath6 defined on the set of the pure strategy profiles @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 ( a mapping from each action tuple to a real value ) .",
    "if player @xmath2 takes one of the actions from @xmath4 in a deterministic way , it is called a pure strategy .",
    "otherwise , if the player takes any of the actions following some probability distribution @xmath9 defined on the action set @xmath4 , it is called a mixed strategy .",
    "that is , for each action @xmath10 , the player @xmath2 takes this action with a probability @xmath11 .",
    "a set of ( mixed ) strategies @xmath12 , one for each player , is called a ( mixed ) strategy profile @xmath13 .",
    "assume that the @xmath0 players take a strategy profile @xmath13 .",
    "then the payoff of player @xmath2 is defined as @xmath14 the objective of each player is to maximize his payoff .",
    "a strategy profile excluding the one for player @xmath2 is denoted as @xmath15 .",
    "a strategy profile @xmath16 is a nash equilibrium if for all @xmath2 and for all @xmath9 , @xmath17 that is , no unilateral deviation in strategy by any player gives higher payoff for that player .",
    "nash s 1950 pnas paper proves the existence for an equilibrium for any finite @xmath0-player game using kakutani s fixed point theorem .    in the following discussions , without loss of generality , we assume all utility functions are of positive function values , i.e. , @xmath18 , for any @xmath19 .    if player @xmath2 takes an action @xmath10 in response to other players strategies @xmath15 , the payoff is @xmath20 .",
    "the optimal action @xmath21 for the player @xmath2 is defined as the one with the highest payoff , i.e. , @xmath22 obviously , @xmath23    one of the important properties of a nash equilibrium @xmath16 is that only the optimal action(s ) has non - zero probability , i.e. , if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 must be the optimal action for the player @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "player @xmath2 is completely selfish because he only accepts the optimal action for himself .",
    "assume that , at a time instance @xmath26 , the strategy profile excluding the one for player @xmath2 is @xmath27 , the action payoff for player @xmath2 is @xmath28 , for @xmath10 .",
    "based on the above observation , we can define a mathematical model to formulate the construction of the next time strategy @xmath29 for player @xmath2 based on his action payoff @xmath28 at the current time @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , we can construct @xmath29 such that it is proportional to @xmath28 , e.g. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a parameter of a non - negative value .",
    "since @xmath29 should be normalized as a probability , the above formula can be rewritten as @xmath32    in ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) , when @xmath33 , the best action has a non - zero probability while others have probability zero .",
    "that is , the player only accepts the best action , the one with the highest payoff @xmath34 .",
    "it is exactly same as the case of nash equilibrium described before .",
    "if the value of @xmath31 is reduced from the above extreme case , the player @xmath2 starts to accept sub - optimal actions by assigning non - zero probability to them .",
    "the degree of the acceptance increases with further decrease of @xmath31 . at another extreme case ,",
    "when @xmath35 , each action is assigned with the same probability and the player has no preference on any one of the actions .",
    "all of the actions are treated equally and they are sampled uniformly . in this case , the player is completely selfishless . in summary ,",
    "the parameter @xmath31 describes the selfishness level of player @xmath2 .",
    "it covers the spectrum ranging from complete selfishness ( @xmath33 ) to complete selfishlessness ( @xmath36 ) .    in the special case of @xmath33 , the game playing defined by the constructive generalization  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] )",
    "is the same in principle as fictitious play introduced by g.w .",
    "brown in 1951  @xcite . in fictitious play",
    ", each player takes the optimal action(s ) in respond to the strategies of other players .    given a non - negative real value for the selfishness level @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "if the iterative computation defined by ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) reaches an equilibrium , that is , there is a strategy profile @xmath16 satisfying @xmath38 then the strategy profile @xmath16 is called a generalized equilibrium .    in parallel with nash s 1950 pnas paper , the proof of the existence of a generalized equilibrium given any selfishness level is provided below .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown that when the selfishness level is sufficiently high , a generalized equilibrium falls back to a nash equilibrium .    a generalized equilibrium @xmath16 defined by ( [ general - equilibrium ] ) exists for any @xmath0-player normal form game with any selfishness level @xmath31 of a non - negative value @xmath39 .",
    "it is still true even if each player @xmath2 in the game has his own selfishness level @xmath40 , possibly different from the rest .",
    "the set of iterative equations  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) defines a mapping from the strategy profile set to itself . because the set is compact and the mapping is continuous , so a fixed point exists based on brouwer fixed point theorem .",
    "the second part of this theorem tells us that , for any @xmath0-player normal form game , even if the selfishness level is different from player to player , a generalized equilibrium still exists for the game .",
    "it is important to note that ( [ general - equilibrium ] ) defines a system of polynomials if @xmath31 is an integer .",
    "if it is also an even number , then any real value solution to this system , which must also be a positive solution , is also a generalized equilibrium for the game playing .",
    "also , the game playing defined by ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) can be treated as an iterative , direct method to find an equilibrium of the game playing .",
    "it defines a protocol for the players in a game to interact with each other so that an equilibrium can be reached with any selfishness level . following this protocol",
    ", each player only needs to know his own utility function and the strategies of other players at the current time to compute his strategy for the next time .",
    "the strategies of other players can be obtained through either statistical learning or message passing among the players .",
    "when the selfishness level @xmath31 is sufficiently large , i.e. , @xmath33 , any generalized equilibrium defined by ( [ general - equilibrium ] ) can be arbitrarily close to a nash equilibrium and _ vice versa_.    the proof is given in the subsection  [ proof - theorem2 ] in the appendix .    as a consequence , any real value solution to the system of polynomials defined by ( [ general - equilibrium ] ) with a large even number for @xmath31 can be served as a good approximation to a nash equilibrium .",
    "alternatively , the game playing defined by ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) with a sufficiently large @xmath31 can be applied directly to reach an equilibrium which can also be served as a good approximation of a nash equilibrium .",
    "when @xmath33 , from ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) we can see that @xmath29 is no longer a continuous function of @xmath28 . in this case , any mixed strategy can be extremely unstable for the slightest change in @xmath28 caused by the inaccuracy at representing the utility functions , the variation of the utility functions , any perturbation and communication error among the players .",
    "for example , a small variation in the utility function could lead to a dramatic shift of the equilibrium from one point in the strategy profile space to another one .",
    "it is hard for an algorithmic method to converge to an unstable equilibrium purely based on iterations .",
    "even if a game of completely selfish players can reach an equilibrium , it may have an enormous number of equilibria , possibly growing exponentially with the number of the players of the game .",
    "the players could get stuck into one nash equilibrium or another , depending on the initial conditions and sensitive to perturbations . how to reach an equilibrium which gives relatively good overall payoff for the game",
    "becomes a challenging problem ( the overall payoff for a game is defined as the summation of the players payoffs , i.e. , @xmath41 ) .    as a summary",
    ", we can say that complete selfishness of the players in a game may lead to the difficulty for the players to reach an equilibrium .",
    "even if an equilibrium is found , it could also be unstable , sensitive to perturbations , sensitive to inaccuracy or variations in utility functions , and vulnerable to communication errors .",
    "furthermore , the overall payoff of the game may be ignored due to the fact that each player only tries to maximize his own payoff .",
    "it is desirable to improve the overall payoff for a society because it stands for improved individual payoff on average .",
    "also , everyone in the society could benefit from the improved overall payoff if some social welfare system is implemented to redistribute the social wealth .",
    "can we improve the overall payoff and the stability of a game playing by simply reducing the selfishness level of the players in the game ?",
    "both experimental result in the following section and a theoretical investigation in appendix ( subsection  [ theoretical - investigation ] ) will affirm the above question .",
    "the theoretical investigation shows that the game playing defined by the constructive generalization  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) is a variation of a global optimization algorithm  @xcite defined by a multi - agent system .",
    "when the value of the parameter @xmath31 is reduced below a certain threshold , the global optimization algorithm has one and only one equilibrium and converges to it with an exponential rate .",
    "if the equilibrium is also a consensus one among all the agents , then it must be the global optimum , guaranteed by theory . above the threshold",
    ", the number of equilibria of the global optimization algorithm may grow with the value of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "that is , the algorithm becomes less stable with the increase of @xmath31 , but the chance of reaching a consensus increases , however .",
    "the theory suggests that reducing the selfishness level from the extreme of complete selfishness can stabilize the game playing and possibly improve the overall payoff .",
    "the experiments in the next section verifies that the overall payoff for many games is best in a statistical sense at a certain level of selfishness , neither at the complete selfishness one nor at the complete selfishlessness one . applying this to social situations",
    ", it suggests that a society should let some level of selfishness remain in its individuals .",
    "otherwise , nobody has any motivation to pursue better payoffs .",
    "also , it is not recommended to take the other extreme where everyone is completely selfish .",
    "however , how to find the best selfish level for any game remains as an open question .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma constitutes a basic problem in game theory . it is a typical non - zero - sum game in which two players can either `` cooperate '' or `` defect '' the other player . in this game , the only concern of each individual player ( `` prisoner '' ) is to maximize his / her own payoff .",
    "regardless of what the opponent chooses , each prisoner always receives a higher payoff by defecting ; i.e. , defecting is the strictly dominant strategy .",
    "therefore , the only possible nash equilibrium for the game is for all prisoners to defect .",
    "an example payoff matrix of the prisoner s dilemma is given as follows :     &  3,3   &  1,4   + &  4,1   & * 2,2 * +    at the nash equilibrium ( the element in the matrix with a bold font ) , the payoffs of the two players are ( 2,2 ) .",
    "it corresponds to the case when the selfishness level @xmath42 .",
    "when the two players reduce their selfishness level together , their payoffs at equilibria also increase together as shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "those equilibria are found by the constructive generalization  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) with different selfishness levels .    from fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] we can see that when the two players have the same selfishness level and the level is of a high value ( @xmath43 ) , their payoffs are close to those of the nash equilibrium . the moment that the both players reduce their selfishness level , both get better payoffs than those of the nash equilibrium .",
    "when the selfishness level reduces to one ( @xmath44 ) , the payoffs are close to @xmath45 for both , a @xmath46 increases over the one of the nash equilibrium .",
    "the result seems counterintuitive because if one player could update his strategy to improve his payoff , he should go ahead to do it in order to receiving a better payoff .",
    "however , in many cases , all the players in a game are inter - connected .",
    "the gain of one player often leads to the loss of other players .",
    "if everyone yields back a little bit of his payoff as a favor to others , everyone can end up with better payoff as a returned favor from others instead .    to show the power of the constructive generalization at finding nash equilibria , a 2-player game is used with the following payoff matrix :    @xmath47",
    "this game has been used in other game theory literatures as a hard game because it has only one mixed nash equilibrium .",
    "the strategy for the row player is @xmath48 with the payoff @xmath49 .",
    "the strategy for the column player is @xmath50 with the payoff @xmath51 .",
    "this mixed nash equilibrium is extremely unstable .",
    "assume that the two players play the game by taking only the best action .",
    "assume further that the column player could nt represent fraction numbers .",
    "instead , the player uses real values to approximate them , just like the real values stored in most computers .",
    "then , a very slight round - off error for the value @xmath52 , say @xmath53 , could knock the row player off of his nash equilibrium strategy to the new one @xmath54 , which will in turn knock the column player off his nash equilibrium strategy . as a consequence ,",
    "both of them will immediately be knocked off the nash equilibrium and get stuck into a chaotic situation .",
    "therefore , this game is hard for an iteration - based direct method to reach the unique mixed nash equilibrium .    despite of its hardness ,",
    "the constructive generalization  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) as an iteration - based direct method can find a very good approximation to the nash equilibrium . to improve the convergence property of the method , an additional step is added after computing @xmath55 defined by ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) to smooth out its fluctuation .",
    "it is done by keeping some memory of the previous value of @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 where @xmath57 was used in the experiment .",
    "furthermore , to increase the chance for the constructive generalization to reach an equilibrium at a high selfishness level @xmath31 , the value of @xmath31 is progressively raised from a small value , say @xmath58 . when it reaches the value @xmath59 , the payoff for the row player is @xmath60 , a difference around @xmath61 to the payoff 4 of the nash equilibrium .",
    "his strategy ( left ) is very close to the nash equilibrium one ( right ) as shown below : @xmath62 the payoff for the column player is @xmath63 , a difference around @xmath64 to the payoff @xmath51 of the nash equilibrium .",
    "his strategy ( left ) is very close to the nash equilibrium one ( right ) as shown below : @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig-2 ] shows the changes of the payoffs of the two players in relation to the selfishness level .",
    "the payoff of the row player is peaked around @xmath66 with the value @xmath67 , the payoff of the column player is peaked around @xmath68 with the value @xmath69 . at @xmath70 ,",
    "the payoffs for both are @xmath71 , a @xmath72 improvement for the row player and a @xmath73 improvement for the column player over the payoffs @xmath74 of the nash equilibrium .    to illustrate the power of the constructive generalization  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) at stabilizing game playing , a 2-players game with 6 actions for each",
    "is constructed with the following payoff matrix : @xmath75    clearly , this game has six actions for each player and six pure nash equilibria .",
    "let us label the actions for each player as @xmath76 .",
    "if any player picks the @xmath2th action in random , the other will take the same action as the best response . as a consequence , a nash equilibrium is thus found .    with this best - response playing ,",
    "the average payoff for each player is @xmath77 , the variance of the payoff is @xmath78 .",
    "three hundred generalized equilibria are found using the constructive generalization  ( [ construct - new - strategy ] ) with the selfishness levels @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath80 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] respectively . from the figures we can see that the stability of the game playing defined by the constructive generalization improves progressively as the selfishness level @xmath31 decreases . here",
    ", the stability is reversely proportional to the variance of the payoff .",
    "when @xmath44 , the game playing always converges to a unique equilibrium with the payoff=@xmath81 after three hundred runs .",
    "that is , the game playing tends to have only one equilibrium when the selfishness level drops below a certain threshold .",
    "also we can see from the three figures that the average payoff of each player is of the highest value when @xmath82 .    from this example , we can see that the constructive generalization yields the best payoffs for the players in a game at a certain selfishness level .",
    "the stability of the game playing continuously improves as the selfishness level reduces .",
    "that is , reducing the selfishness level can always improve the stability of the game playing .",
    "however , the players in a game can only get the highest payoffs at a statistical sense at a certain selfishness level ( in the subsection  [ theoretical - investigation ] in the appendix , a theoretical investigation is given to offer some explanation ) .    in the following set of experiments , computer - generated societies with a population ranging from hundreds to a thousand",
    "are used to demonstrate the improvement of payoffs and stability by reducing the selfishness level . in each society",
