    "the search for new applications of quantum groups @xcite , other than the theory of integrable models , have diversified to several areas of theoretical physics .",
    "the literature on this subject deals mainly with formulations to build quantum group versions of the lorentz and poincar algebras @xcite , or the use of a quantum group as an internal symmetry in quantum mechanics and field theory @xcite .",
    "although many of these approaches address interesting theoretical questions , they in general remain at a formalism level , with the quantum group parameter @xmath3 playing merely the role of a deformation parameter . as it is well known , in the quantum inverse scattering method and vertex models , the parameter @xmath3 acquires a physical meaning through its relation with planck s constant and the anisotropy of the lattice respectively .",
    "in order to look for the physical role that @xmath3 could play in other areas of physics , in previous papers @xcite we began a study of the thermodynamic properties of quantum group gases , which are the quantum group fermion ( qgf ) and quantum group boson ( qgb ) models .",
    "these models can be interpreted as either fermion or boson gases with interactions fixed by the quantum group . for reasons of simplicity",
    ", we considered for both cases the simplest @xmath0 invariant hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , the qgb model has the interesting property that in two and three spatial dimensions the parameter @xmath3 interpolates within a wide range of attractive and repulsive systems including the free boson and fermion cases .",
    "therefore , the departure from the value @xmath5 , which at the mathematical level implies the noncommutativity of quantum group matrix elements , gives in a simple thermodynamic model , an alternative approach to fractional statistics .",
    "this work is a study on the implications of introducing quantum group symmetries in a thermodynamic system at low temperatures , with particular emphasis in the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "there is , at present , no direct indication that quantum group symmetries are realized in any particular thermodynamic system . at the moment ,",
    "a quantum group gas is a mathematical model which may or may not explain the behavior of real gases in a particular situation . nevertheless , by performing the kind of calculations considered here , questions regarding the possible relevance of quantum groups in a thermodynamic system can be answered .",
    "our starting point is to consider the simplest quantum group , @xmath0 , invariant hamiltonian , and calculate the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding interacting boson gas .",
    "our main motivation resides in finding out about the role that these interactions , which result from the requirement of quantum group invariance , may play at low temperatures .",
    "it would be of much interest , in the author s opinion , if these interactions could fit energy related data obtained from the experiments .    in experimental settings , trapping potentials are well approximated by the potential of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "a noninteracting bose gas in a harmonic potential @xcite is known to exhibit a discontinuity in the heat capacity .",
    "this discontinuity is , however , considerably larger than the one reported in a recent experiment involving a dilute gas of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition , introducing two - particle interactions , has the effect @xcite , for the case of a harmonic oscillator potential , of making the heat capacity continuous , and therefore less agreeable with reference @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider whether the boson interactions , required by the quantum group invariance of the hamiltonian , give a thermodynamic behavior that could fit this and other experimental data .",
    "in addition , we expect these interactions to be weak , and a good agreement should occur for values of @xmath3 close to the standard value @xmath5 .    in this paper , as a first step , we study the qgb model with no external potential .",
    "an obvious question to address is , under which conditions the qgb model exhibits bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . under these conditions ,",
    "what is the behavior of the internal energy and heat capacity at the critical temperature @xmath2 , and what is the dependence , if any , of @xmath2 on @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we answer those questions by analyzing the low temperature behavior of the qgb model with @xmath0 symmetry .    in section ( [ ba ] )",
    "we discuss the general formalism and redefine our model in terms of boson operators .",
    "a more detailed and general discussion is given in reference @xcite .",
    "section [ lt ] contains the main results of the paper .",
    "we calculate the dependence of the heat capacity @xmath1 , internal energy @xmath7 , entropy @xmath8 and equation of state on the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we show , that the boson interactions that arise from the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian , produce a discontinuity , @xmath9-transition , in the heat capacity at the condensation temperature .",
    "the quantum group @xmath0 consists of the set of matrices @xmath10 with elements @xmath11 generating the algebra @xmath12 with the unitary conditions @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath0 transformation @xmath16 matrix and the corresponding @xmath17 matrix    @xmath18    satisfy the algebraic relations @xcite @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we define as @xmath0-bosons the set of fields @xmath25 , satisfying the relations @xmath26    equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) are covariant under the field redefinitions @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath5 , the operators @xmath30 become ordinary bosons @xmath31 .",
    "the operators @xmath30 should not be confused with the so called @xmath3-boson oscillators .",
    "a set @xmath32 of @xmath3-bosons are defined , by the relations @xcite @xmath33=0=[a_i , a_j],\\label{q1}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "several variations of equation ( [ q1 ] ) are common in the literature . by taking two sets of @xmath3-bosons , as defined in equation ( [ q1 ] ) ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the operators @xmath35 provide a realization of the quantum lie algebra @xmath36 @xmath37=\\pm j_{\\pm}\\;,\\;\\;\\;\\ ; [ j_-,j_-]=[2j_3].\\ ] ]    the main distinction between the @xmath30 operators with @xmath3-bosons is that , in contrast to equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) , the algebraic relations in equation ( [ q1 ] ) are not covariant under the action of the @xmath38 quantum group matrices .",
    "several studies on the thermodynamics of @xmath3-bosons , and similar operators called quons @xcite , have been published @xcite . in particular , a system defined by a free hamiltonian in terms of @xmath3-oscillators has been shown to exhibit bec @xcite .",
    "certainly , the work devoted to the thermodynamics of @xmath3-oscillators represents a test on the consequences of modifying boson commutators , according to equation ( [ q1 ] ) and its different versions . on the other hand , the algebraic relations in equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) , with the model discussed in this paper ,",
    "address the implications that result of imposing quantum group invariance in a thermodynamic system .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian written in terms of the operators @xmath30 is certainly the one that becomes for @xmath5 the free boson hamiltonian with two species .",
    "it is simply written as @xmath39 where @xmath40=0 $ ] for @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for a given @xmath43",
    "the @xmath0 bosons are written in terms of boson operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 with usual commutation relations : @xmath46=\\delta_{ij}$ ] as follows @xmath47 leading to the interacting boson hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ordinary boson number operator and the bracket @xmath50 . the grand partition function @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 which after rearrangement simplifies to the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fugacity .",
    "in this section we study the low temperature ( high density ) properties of the qgb gas , which is represented by the partition function in equation ( [ z ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will study the conditions under which bec will occur . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "we write @xmath55 where , as in the ideal bose case , the divergence of the @xmath56 term as @xmath57 has been taken into account by splitting @xmath58 in a single term plus an integration .",
    "the series in the integrand of equation ( [ lnz ] ) diverges for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , giving in this case no transition point . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the series is more convergent than the ideal bose case , and bec is expected to occur .",
    "the average total number of particles is given by @xmath62 where the function @xmath63 expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath64 and integrating we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 and the coefficient @xmath67 becomes , for @xmath5 , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , based on standard notation we rewrite equation ( [ n ] ) as @xmath69 such that @xmath70 . in the @xmath71 limit ,",
    "equation ( [ n ] ) corresponds to the case of an ideal bose gas with two species .",
    "this model will exhibit bose - einstein condensation for those values of the temperature or density such that @xmath72 where the critical temperature @xmath2 and critical density @xmath73 are given by the following equations @xmath74 @xmath75 since for @xmath61 the function @xmath76 , then the critical temperature @xmath2 for this model is larger than the critical temperature @xmath77 for the ideal bose gas . for a given density",
    "the two temperatures are related by @xmath78 giving then @xmath79 . for the internal energy @xmath7 we have",
    "@xmath80 expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath64 leads to the equation @xmath81 with the identification @xmath82 .",
    "figure 1 shows a graph obtained from a numerical calculation of the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "these functions decrease from its maximum value @xmath86 and @xmath87 and remain practically constant for @xmath4 .",
    "1 . the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as defined in the text , for @xmath85 .",
    "the value of these functions decrease from its maximum value at @xmath5 , and remains approximately constant for @xmath4 +   + the heat capacity is written in terms of the internal energy according to the general expression @xmath88 where @xmath89 . for values of the temperature very close to @xmath2 the chemical potential @xmath90 and its derivative @xmath91 , and",
    "therefore if @xmath92 there will be a discontinuity in the heat capacity according to @xmath93 a simple way @xcite to find @xmath94 is by first considering that for a closed system @xmath95 , such that for @xmath96 , @xmath97 so from equation ( [ n ] ) , we obtain @xmath98 at @xmath5 the denominator of equation ( [ mu ] ) becomes the divergent series @xmath99 , and then @xmath100 .",
    "the denominator converges for all values of @xmath61 , showing that the heat capacity exhibits a gap at the critical temperature .",
    "in particular , for low temperatures such that @xmath101 we have that the chemical potential @xmath102 and its derivative @xmath103 , giving for the heat capacity @xmath104 such that after inserting equation ( [ temp ] ) the heat capacity becomes @xmath105 the dependence of the function @xmath106 on @xmath3 will indicate how much the behavior of the heat capacity for this model departs from the ideal bose case .    in order to find the heat capacity for temperatures @xmath96",
    ", we expand the @xmath58 in powers of the fugacity @xmath64 . after performing the elementary integrations , the first few terms read @xmath107 where @xmath108-(1/\\sqrt{2})\\right)$ ] . calculating the average number of particles and reverting the equation",
    ", we find , the fugacity and the internal energy as functions of @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111    fig .",
    "2 . the heat capacity @xmath1 as a function of the temperature for several values of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the gap at the condensation temperature increases with @xmath3 up to a value @xmath112 at @xmath113 and remains constant for @xmath114 .",
    "+ the heat capacity is then given by @xmath115 such that with the use of equation ( [ temp ] ) it becomes @xmath116 according to equations ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) the gap in the heat capacity is then given by the equation @xmath117    figure @xmath118 shows the discontinuity of the heat capacity @xmath1 for different values of @xmath3 , and shows that the gap is more sensitive to small deviations of @xmath3 from the ideal bose case @xmath5 .",
    "the gap increases with the value of the parameter @xmath3 and remains approximately constant for @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in this model , the onset of bec becomes a second order phase transition .    at low temperatures @xmath101 , the chemical potential @xmath119 , giving for the entropy and the equation of state @xmath120 according to figure 1 ,",
    "the entropy has the interesting property that for a given temperature @xmath101 it acquires its maximum value at @xmath5",
    ". this same feature was also found at low temperatures for the case of a quantum group fermion gas @xcite .",
    "then , the interactions introduced by the @xmath0 symmetry are such that they decrease the entropy below the one corresponding to the standard case @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we studied the low temperature behavior of a quantum group gas with @xmath0 symmetry in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our results indicate , that the boson interactions introduced by the quantum symmetry are such that this system exhibits bose - einstein condensation for @xmath61 .",
    "the interaction terms are fixed by the quantum symmetry of the hamiltonian , which are the values @xmath121 and @xmath3 of @xmath38 . for purposes of simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath122 and analyzed the effect of varying @xmath3 . the parameter @xmath3 , which in the boson representation controls the strength of the interactions , plays the role of increasing the condensation temperature , reducing the entropy , and producing a gap in the heat capacity at the onset of the bec .",
    "our results are written in terms of the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 introduced in the text .",
    "these functions decrease rapidly from their respective values @xmath123 and @xmath124 at @xmath5 , and become approximately constant for @xmath4 . therefore , the properties of this model will be more sensitive to those @xmath3 values which are small deviations from the ideal bose case @xmath5 .",
    "a simple numerical check shows that the critical temperature for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , corresponds to @xmath127 .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that the same value @xmath127 fits very well the gap in the heat capacity of a dilute gas of @xmath6 atoms , as reported in reference @xcite , although a realistic comparison with experimental results requires to consider , in addition , an external harmonic potential and the corrections due to a small number @xmath128 of particles",
    ". another interesting feature of this model is that at high temperatures and @xmath129 it behaves as an interacting fermion gas @xcite and , on the other hand , at low temperatures and @xmath61 it exhibits bec .",
    "the system studied in this paper is described by the simplest quantum group invariant hamiltonian , and the calculations were made in the thermodynamic limit and with no external potential .",
    "some recent studies for the case of an ideal bose gas inside a trapping potential , in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ; and with a finite number of particles @xcite show the effect of these corrections on the condensation temperature and heat capacity . therefore , since in our case , the interactions are fixed by the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian , a natural continuation of our work will be to include those corrections such that a more direct comparison to experimental results can be made .",
