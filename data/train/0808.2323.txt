    "recently , there has been much interest in the feasibility of mapping the three - dimensional distribution of cosmic hydrogen through its resonant spin - flip transition at a rest - frame wavelength of 21 cm  ( furlanetto , oh & briggs  2007 ; barkana & loeb  2007 ) .",
    "several experiments are currently being constructed ( including mwa  , lofar  , paper  , 21cma  , gmrt  ) and more ambitious designs are being planned ( ska  ) .",
    "one driver for mapping the 21 cm emission is the possibility of measuring cosmological parameters from the shape of the underlying power spectrum ( ps ; see loeb & wyithe 2008 ) . during the epoch of reionization",
    ", the ps of 21 cm brightness fluctuations is shaped mainly by the topology of ionized regions , rather than by the ps of matter density fluctuations which is the quantity of cosmological interest  ( mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ; santos et al .  2007 ; iliev et al .",
    "2007 ) . as a result",
    ", the line - of - sight anisotropy of the 21 cm ps due to peculiar velocities must be used to separate measurements of the density ps from the unknown details of the astrophysics ( barkana & loeb  2005 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "the situation is expected to be simpler both prior to the formation of the first galaxies ( at redshifts @xmath2 , loeb & zaldarriaga  2004 ; lewis & challinor  2007 ; pritchard & loeb  2008 ) , and following reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; @xmath3 )  when only dense pockets of self - shielded hydrogen , such as damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dla ) and lyman - limit systems ( lls ) survive  ( wyithe & loeb  2008 ; chang et al .",
    "2007 ; pritchard & loeb  2008 ) .",
    "in this paper we focus our discussion on the post - reionization epoch ( wyithe & loeb  2007 ; chang et al .",
    "the dlas which contain most of the neutral hydrogen mass in the universe at @xmath4 are expected to be hosted by galactic mass dark matter halos  ( wolfe , gawiser & prochaska  2005 ) .",
    "a survey of 21 cm intensity fluctuations after reionization would measure the modulation of the cumulative 21 cm emission from a large number of galaxies  ( wyithe & loeb  2008 ; wyithe , loeb & geil  2008 ; chang et al .",
    "2007 ) . regarding the measurement of the 21 cm",
    "ps , this lack of identification of individual galaxies is an advantage , since by not imposing a minimum threshold for detection , such a survey collects all the available signal .",
    "this point is discussed in pen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the technique is also demonstrated via measurement of the cross - correlation of galaxies with unresolved 21 cm emission in the local universe .    studying the 21 cm ps after ( rather than during )",
    "reionization offers two advantages .",
    "first , it is less contaminated by the galactic synchrotron foreground , whose brightness temperature scales with redshift as @xmath5  ( furlanetto , oh & briggs  2006 ) . second , because the uv radiation field is nearly uniform after reionization , it should not imprint any large - scale features on the 21 cm ps that would mimic the cosmological signatures .",
    "in addition , on large spatial scales the 21 cm sources are expected to have a linear bias analogous to that inferred from galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "most previous studies of post - reionization 21 cm fluctuations have assumed that the 21 cm emission traces perturbations in the matter density , and have considered peculiar motions only after a spherical average  ( wyithe & loeb  2008 ; pritchard & loeb  2008 , loeb & wyithe  2008 ) .",
    "the exception is a recent paper discussing measurements of the dark energy equation of state ( chang et al .",
    "since the neutral gas resides within collapsed dark matter halos , galaxy bias plays an important role in setting the 21 cm fluctuation amplitude . in this paper",
    "we derive the 21 cm ps after reionization in the context of the formalism that has been developed to calculate it during reionization  ( barkana & loeb  2005 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ; mao et al .",
    "2008 ) . by framing the derivation this way , the relative merits of cosmological constraints from 21 cm surveys at redshifts before and after reionization can be more easily understood .",
    "in addition , this formalism provides a framework to describe the possible effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background .",
    "we then compute the alcock - paczynski effect  ( alcock & paczynski  1979 ) as an example for the cosmological utility of the post - reionization 21 cm ps . in our numerical examples ,",
    "we adopt the standard set of cosmological parameters  ( komatsu et al .",
    "2008 ) , with values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the matter , baryon , and dark energy fractional density respectively , and @xmath9 , for the dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "the 21 cm ps after reionization is expected to be dominated by the neutral content of galaxies . in a scenario",
    "where fluctuations in the ionizing background can be ignored , the form of the ps could therefore be inferred directly from the galaxy ps ( loeb & wyithe 2008 ) .",
    "however , we also include here the possible influence of a fluctuating ionizing background on the 21 cm ps . throughout our discussion",
    ", we assume the baryonic overdensity @xmath10 to equal the overdensity in dark - matter on sufficiently large scales .      the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuation in a region of igm is @xmath11\\left(1+\\delta\\right)\\left(1-\\delta_v\\right)\\,\\mbox{mk},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the gradient of the peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mean ionization fraction and the fluctuation in ionization fraction , respectively . we have assumed that the spin temperature of hydrogen is much higher than the cmb temperature [ as expected for collisionally coupled gas in collapsed objects , and observed in some dlas  ( curran et al .  2007 ) ] .",
    "thus we may neglect fluctuations in the kinetic and spin temperatures of the neutral hydrogen gas throughout the post reionization epoch . to evaluate the brightness temperature fluctuation we need to compute @xmath15 . with this goal in mind",
    ", we first write the fluctuation in neutral hydrogen fraction as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cosmic mean and local values for the neutral fraction ( mass averaged ) .",
    "next we compute the effect of the ionizing background on the neutral fraction .",
    "two regimes must be considered .",
    "low density regions of the universe contain optically thin , ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "the ionization fraction in this regime is controlled by the balance between the ionization rate owing to the uv background and the recombination rate at the local gas density . given an ionization rate @xmath19 , and a hydrogen density @xmath20 with a neutral fraction @xmath18 , the equilibrium in the optically thin regime is given by the condition @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the case - b recombination coefficient ( osterbrock & ferland  2006 ) .",
    "assuming that the low density regions of the hydrogen density field are unbiased with respect to the underlying dark matter density , we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the perturbation in the intergalactic ionizing background .",
    "note that the neutral fraction in optically thin regions is increased in overdense regions by recombinations , and decreased by the presence of an excess ionizing background .      since optically - thick systems are self - shielded , the effect of the uv background on their ionization state depends on the gas distribution within them .",
    "below we discuss the effect of an ionizing background on the hi content of self - shielded systems .",
    "since most of the hydrogen in such systems is known to be contained within dlas , we focus our discussion on dlas .    the nature of dlas is not understood , although they are thought to be formed by dense , self - shielded gas in galaxies ( wolfe , gawiser & prochaska  2005 ) .",
    "the detailed modeling of dlas is very uncertain , requiring numerical simulations that go beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however we can utilise results of simulations in the literature to estimate the range of possible strength for the influence of the uv background .",
    "the column density distribution of dlas has a power - law form with a feature at @xmath25@xmath26 ( e.g. storrie - lombardi & wolfe  2000 ) .",
    "this feature has been interpreted by a number of authors as being due to the effects of self shielding of dlas in a meta - galactic ionizing background ( e.g. corbelli , salpeter & bandiera  2001 ; zheng & mirada - escude  2002 ) .",
    "zheng & mirada - escude  ( 2002 ) considered the column density distribution of damped ly@xmath0 systems modeled as spherical isothermal spheres .",
    "they solved for the self shielded hi density profile numerically and found that the neutral fraction reaches @xmath27 at the radius where the system becomes optically thick to meta - galactic ionizing radiation .",
    "their results demonstrate that the transition from highly ionized to highly neutral gas occurs over a narrow region which is very small compared with the size of the absorbing system .",
    "moreover , they find that the radius @xmath28 at which the gas becomes self - shielding is proportional to @xmath29 . for a spherical isothermal sphere , the hydrogen mass enclosed within radius @xmath30 scales as @xmath31 and so the hi mass scales as @xmath32 we therefore find that a given perturbation in the ionizing background produces a corresponding perturbation in the mass of neutral hydrogen within the self - shielded system of the form @xmath33    alternatively , the distribution of gas in a dla may be better represented by a self - gravitating disk .",
    "the effect of a meta - galactic background on the ionization structure and starformation has been investigated by a number of authors ( corbelli , salpeter & bandiera  2001 ; schaye  2004 ; susa  2008 ) .",
    "the hydrogen column depth at which the gas becomes self - shielding was shown to be proportional to @xmath34 as in the spherical isothermal case ( susa  2008 ) .",
    "however the exponential profile of the disk models implies that the ionized portion of the gas contains much less mass than in the case of a more extended power - law isothermal profile .",
    "corbelli , salpeter & bandiera  ( 2001 ) compute the column depth of hi as a fraction of the column depth of hydrogen , at different intensities of ionizing background . for a disk with a column density of @xmath35@xmath26 , the fluctuation in hi",
    "mass owing to a fluctuation in the ionizing background is approximately @xmath36 this effect is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of a spherical isothermal sphere .    to evaluate the fluctuation in neutral fraction associated with dlas we assume that the neutral gas is hosted within halos of mass @xmath37 with associated galaxy bias @xmath38 .",
    "we have ) in the denominator is present because this is the fluctuation in neutral hydrogen fraction rather than in neutral hydrogen mass . ]",
    "@xmath39 where the last equality has reduced the expression to lowest order in @xmath10 .",
    "the above estimates of mass fluctuation suggest that the neutral hydrogen content of the igm is modified owing to fluctuations in the ionizing background ( @xmath40 ) by a factor of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant describing the magnitude of the effect . for optically thin regions @xmath43 , while for optically thick absorbers @xmath42 can take a range of values . in the case of an isothermal sphere",
    ", a fluctuation in the ionizing background leads to a fluctuation in the hi mass of a self shielded system that is of comparable magnitude , indicating that the value of @xmath42 in equation  ( [ fluctuation ] ) would be of order unity in this case .",
    "however , in halos with virial temperatures larger than @xmath44k , hydrogen with an isothermal profile would be collisionally ionized , and hence have cooled into a much more concentrated profile . since the host masses of dlas are known to be greater than @xmath45m@xmath46 from clustering studies ( cook et al .",
    "2006 ) , an isothermal profile does not provide a physically plausible model . on the other hand ,",
    "modeling dlas using an exponential disk , as is appropriate for gas rich galaxies implies a much smaller value value of @xmath47@xmath48 .",
    "thus , the effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background on the mass averaged hi density is expected to be small ( @xmath49 )",
    ".    we can now add the effects of fluctuations in ionizing background on the neutral content of optically thin and optically thick absorbers within a region of large scale overdensity @xmath10 .",
    "we have @xmath50\\\\ & & \\hspace{-8mm}\\sim \\bar{x}_{\\rm hi } \\left[1+(b-1)\\delta - c\\delta_{j}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the fractions of hi in the optically thin and optically thick regimes respectively . in the last equality , we assume the case where the optically thin component contains a negligible amount of the cosmic hi . note that we ignore the optically thin component of the hydrogen in the remainder of this paper",
    ". however we point out that the inclusion of this additional component changes only the values of the co - efficients of @xmath10 and @xmath53 in the above equations , but not the form of the expression .      before deriving the fluctuation in neutral fraction",
    "we next need to calculate the dependence of the parameter @xmath53 on scale .",
    "ionizing radiation in the igm has a finite mean - free - path which increases with time following the end of reionization . on scales larger than the mean - free - path ( @xmath54 ) , with associated wavenumber @xmath55 ,",
    "all ionizing photons within a fluctuation were produced by galaxies that were also within that fluctuation . in this case",
    "fluctuations in the ionizing background simply trace fluctuations in the density of galaxies so that the value of @xmath56 is independent of scale .",
    "however , on scales smaller than the mean - free - path , ionizing photons were not produced by galaxies local to the fluctuation . as a result @xmath57 is scale dependent .    to derive this dependence we convolve the real space density field with a filter function to account for the effects of finite mean - free - path and the inverse square dependence of ionizing flux .",
    "the fluctuation in flux at a position @xmath58 becomes @xmath59 for simplicity we assume that all ionizing photons travel one mean - free - path , hence @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this may be rewritten @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the fourier transforms of the ionizing flux field and filter function respectively .",
    "we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for small scales @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 . for large scales",
    "we find @xmath70 as expected from the argument described above .",
    "thus , we get the following dependence for the function @xmath71 , which can now be written in terms of @xmath10 , @xmath72,\\ ] ] where we have explicitly written in the galaxy bias ( noting that it is the galaxy density rather than the matter density which sources the ionization field ) , and defined the function @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a new constant , which from the discussion following equation  ( [ fluctuation ] ) is expected to be smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "this fitting function interpolates smoothly between the limiting behaviour on small and large scales .",
    "we emphasise that this formulation is only valid on scales for which fluctuations in the density field are in the linear regime .",
    "we can now express the fluctuation in the neutral hydrogen content , noting that this depends both on the density of galaxies and on the fluctuations in the ionizing background .",
    "@xmath76\\delta,\\ ] ] similarly , we write the fluctuation in ionized fraction in terms of the local ionized hydrogen fraction ( @xmath77 ) as @xmath78 using the fact that @xmath79 , we then find the ionization fluctuation in terms of the galaxy bias @xmath80\\,\\left[b(1-k(k))-1\\right]\\delta.\\ ] ]      we can now turn to calculating the 21 cm ps .",
    "to lowest order in fourier space , the velocity fluctuation may be written as , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the cosine of the angle between the @xmath83 and line - of - sight unit vectors  ( kaiser  1987 ) , and is close to unity at high redshifts , taking values of 0.974 , 0.988 and 0.997 at @xmath84 , 3.5 and 5.5 . ] @xmath85 . to leading order in @xmath10",

    "our expression for @xmath91 allows the ionization ps and ionization - density cross - ps to be related to the density ps in a very simple way @xmath92p_{\\delta\\delta}\\\\ p_{xx}&=&\\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\rm hi}^2}{(1-\\bar{x}_{\\rm hi})^2}\\left[b(1-k(k))-1\\right]^2p_{\\delta\\delta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , the ionization ps and ionization - density cross - ps are very simply related to each other @xmath93p_{\\delta x}.\\ ] ]    upon substitution of equation  ( [ pion ] ) into equation  ( [ p21 ] ) we obtain an expression for the angular dependence of the post - reionization 21 cm ps @xmath94 ^ 2p_{\\delta\\delta}.\\ ] ] thus , when combined equations  ( [ p21 ] ) and ( [ pion ] ) provide a simple relation between the density ps and the 21 cm ps involving ionization terms , allowing the full 21 cm ps to be utilized in deriving cosmological constraints .",
    "this compares favorably with the reionization epoch , during which either the @xmath95 term alone can be utilized  ( barkana & loeb  2005 ) , or a functional form for the ionization ps must be assumed  ( mao et al .",
    "2008 ; rhook et al .",
    "2008 ) . on large scales fluctuations in the ionization field will be correlated with density fluctuations .",
    "thus fluctuations in ionizing background would be degenerate with the galaxy bias @xmath38 .",
    "however , on small scales there is scale dependence in the function @xmath96 which breaks the degeneracy between ionization and galaxy bias . in addition , the angular dependence of the ps , which is due to gravitational infall and hence is independent of galaxy bias or ionization , breaks the degeneracy between galaxy bias and neutral fraction .",
    "equation  ( [ dlaps1 ] ) is valid on scales for which fluctuations are in the linear regime , and we can assume that galaxy bias is not scale dependent . in the case where @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( i.e. unbiased sources at high redshift , with no modulation by the ionizing background ) our expression for the ps reduces to the form of a uniformly ionized igm , @xmath99 ^ 2p_{\\delta\\delta}$ ]  ( barkana & loeb  2005 ) .",
    "we note that in the absence of a modulation of power due to the ionizing background , equation  ( [ dlaps1 ] ) could have been derived directly from considering the galaxy ps ( once it is realized that effect of a line - of - sight velocity is the same for the optical depth in the 21 cm line and the galaxy number density ) .",
    "= 5.9 in    equation  ( [ dlaps1 ] ) is valid for a single halo mass .",
    "however the dlas reside within halos having a range of masses . to account for this",
    "we define an unknown hi mass weighted probability density function @xmath100 for the galaxy bias . by substituting @xmath91 into equation  ( [ tb ] ) , and integrating over @xmath101",
    "it is easy to show that the ps for an arbitrary distribution of bias is @xmath102 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the mean of the bias distribution @xmath101 . for completeness",
    "we also calculate the spherically averaged ps @xmath104,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , in the case of @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath98 reduces to the form for a uniformly ionized high redshift igm , @xmath107  ( barkana & loeb  2005 ) .",
    "note that although the relation between neutral hydrogen mass and host halo mass is unknown , the ps depends only on the mean of @xmath101 . for later use",
    "we define @xmath108 to be the halo mass corresponding to @xmath103 .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show examples of the dimensionless 21 cm ps after reionization [ @xmath109 .",
    "we assume @xmath110 , use the sheth - tormen fitting function for the bias  ( sheth , mo & tormen  2001 ) , and consider three redshifts , @xmath84 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , at which the mean - free - path for ionizing photons is taken to be @xmath113 , 300 and 100",
    "co - moving mpc , respectively ( bolton & haehnelt  2007 ; faucher - giguere et al .  2008 ) .",
    "there is at least a factor of 2 uncertainty in the value of the mean - free - path .",
    "however our results are insensitive to the exact value because the mean - free - path is larger than the scales accessible to 21 cm ps observations ( owing to the requirements of foreground removal ) at all redshifts except those closest to reionization .",
    "two models are shown to illustrate the effect of the ionizing background on 21 cm fluctuations . in the first we assume a fiducial model for which the ionizing background has no effect on the fluctuations in neutral fraction ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is shown by the dotted curves in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we also show examples of a model in which @xmath114 , a value which is unphysically large but is chosen so as to clearly illustrate the qualitative effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background on the shape of the 21 cm ps . in this model ,",
    "the fluctuations in neutral fraction due to the ionizing background are as strong as ( and hence cancel ) the effect of the galaxy bias on large scales .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates that the fractional modulation of the 21 cm ps is of order @xmath115 , while as discussed in ",
    "[ thick ] , physically plausible values of @xmath115 are of order @xmath48 .",
    "since the fractional modification of the ps is of order @xmath116 , and our results indicate a fractional change in amplitude which is smaller than a factor of 2 at @xmath117 over the redshift range considered , we therefore find that fluctuations in the ionizing background should modify the 21 cm ps after reionization by @xmath118 on the scales and redshifts of interest .",
    "the effect of the ionizing background on the 21 cm ps can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "firstly , we have argued that the ionizing background follows the galaxy density field on large scales . as a result ,",
    "on large scales regions of overdensity ( underdensity ) will have a higher ( lower ) than average ionizing background . in our linear formulation ,",
    "the effect of the ionizing background is degenerate with galaxy bias on large scales , because in the case of @xmath119 , it lowers ( raises ) the contribution to the 21 cm intensity from galaxies with a particular halo mass .",
    "this modification of the 21 cm intensity of galaxies reduces the amplitude of the ps , at all scales @xmath120 .",
    "we emphasise that because the fluctuations in the ionizing background are strongly correlated with density on large scales , they suppress rather than add additional power to the 21 cm ps . the suppression becomes greater for smaller values of @xmath121 . thus at fixed scale the effect of a fluctuating background is larger at higher redshift where the mean - free - path is smaller .    on small scales",
    "@xmath122 , only some fraction of the ionizing bg is produced locally within the fluctuation .",
    "the remainder of the ionizing background is generated within a region which averages over many fluctuations , and so has a mean value that is near that of the background . as a result ,",
    "the suppression of power described above , owing to a correlation between the ionizing background and overdensity , is not as strong on small scales .",
    "our derivation yields the variation of the suppression with scale ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "it should be noted that our formulation ignores the possible poisson contribution to fluctuations in the ionizing background due to quasars .",
    "poisson fluctuations introduce additional power into the 21 cm ps beyond the component associated with the underlying density field of galaxies .",
    "the effect of poisson fluctuations could become important at low redshift ( @xmath124 ) , where quasars contribute significantly to the ionizing background .",
    "we do not consider the possible poisson contribution in the remainder of this paper which focuses on redshifts above the peak of quasar activity ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "we emphasise that our derivation of the 21 cm ps after reionization is only valid on scales where the density fluctuations are in the linear regime .",
    "it should therefore be noted that there are potential complications that arise due to non - linearities in the mass and velocity fields on small scales .",
    "analysis of the galaxy ps derived from n - body simulations has shown  ( seo & eisenstein  2005 ) that the ps can be treated as linear on scales greater than 15 co - moving mpc ( i.e. @xmath126mpc@xmath127 ) at @xmath111 , increasing towards higher redshifts . however ,",
    "weak oscillatory features in the ps , such as the baryonic acoustic oscillations , are suppressed on even larger scales because matter moves across distances on the order of @xmath12810mpc over a hubble time , the normalization of the power - spectrum on 8@xmath129mpc , is of order unity at the present time . ] . as groups of galaxies form , the linear - theory prediction for the location of each galaxy becomes uncertain , and as a result noise is added to the correlation among galaxies and hence to the measurement of the mass ps .",
    "the noise associated with the movement of galaxies smears out the acoustic peak in the correlation function of galaxies in real space ( eisenstein , seo & white  2007 ; seo , siegel , eisenstein & white  2008 ) .",
    "the associated reduction of power in the baryonic acoustic oscillations is found to be in excess of 70% on scales smaller than @xmath130mpc@xmath127 at @xmath111 , corresponding to a length scale of @xmath131 comoving mpc ( seo et al .  2008 ) .",
    "more importantly for experiments that aim to measure the ps shape is the non - linear correction to the ps due to virialised groups of dlas ( e.g. , tinker et al .  2006 ; tinker  2007 ) .",
    "the group velocity dispersion , @xmath132 , introduces the so - called `` finger - of - god '' in redshift space which is unrelated to the peculiar velocity according to linear theory . we can estimate the wavenumber at which this effect becomes important relative to the hubble flow as , @xmath133 . at @xmath134",
    "we find @xmath135mpc@xmath127 . in the future ,",
    "an improvement to our analysis could be made by including the analytic model for the redshift space galaxy two - point correlation function described by tinker  ( 2007 ) .",
    "this model is constructed within the framework of the halo occupation distribution , and quantifies galaxy bias on linear and non - linear scales .",
    "in addition , the model describes redshift - space distortions and clustering on both linear and non - linear scales .",
    "finally , other non - linear effects may arise that are not present in galaxy redshift surveys , owing to internal rotation curve of the neutral hydrogen .",
    "however , the corresponding wave numbers are very large , @xmath136mpc@xmath127 .      before proceeding to discuss the cosmological potential of the post - reionization 21 cm ps , we compute the sensitivity with which it could be detected .    to compute the sensitivity @xmath137 of a radio - interferometer to the 21 cm ps , we follow the procedure outlined by  mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bowman , morales & hewitt  ( 2007 ) [ see also  wyithe , loeb & geil  ( 2008 ) ] .",
    "the important issues are discussed below , but the reader is referred to these papers for further details .",
    "the uncertainty comprises of components due to the thermal noise , and due to sample variance within the finite volume of the observations .",
    "we also include a poisson component due to the finite sampling of each mode  ( wyithe  2008 ) , since the post - reionization 21 cm ps is generated by discrete clumps rather than a diffuse igm .",
    "however we find that poisson noise dominates only when @xmath138 ( see wyithe  2008 ) .",
    "we assume that foregrounds can be removed over @xmath139mhz bins , within a bandpass of @xmath140mhz  ( mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ) [ foreground removal therefore imposes a minimum on the wave - number accessible of @xmath141^{-1}$]mpc@xmath127 ] , and consider a hypothetical follow - up telescope to the mwa which would have 10 times the total mwa collecting area ( we refer to this as the mwa5000 ) .",
    "this telescope is assumed to have an antenna density distributed as @xmath143 within a diameter of 2 km and a flat density core of radius 80 m ( see mcquinn et al .",
    "the antennae design is taken to be optimized at the redshift of observation ( so that the physical collecting area of the array equals its effective collecting area ) , with each of 5000 phased arrays ( tiles ) consisting of 16 cross - dipoles .",
    "an important ingredient is the angular dependence of the number of modes accessible to the array  ( mcquinn et al .",
    "we assume 3 fields are observed for 1000 hr each . for the experiment described ,",

    "specifically , we use @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the `` no wiggle '' form from eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) , and @xmath182^{-1}$]mpc in the high redshift limit . in addition , to account for the possibility of non - linearity in the smooth ps at small scales we restrict our fitting to wave numbers @xmath183mpc@xmath127 ( see   [ discussion ] ) .    the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] for three redshifts , @xmath84 , 3.5 and 5.5 .",

    "the exception is @xmath187 , which we have assumed to be known apriori ( with gaussian errors ) from future observations of quasar absorption spectra .",
    "the assumed uncertainty in @xmath188 corresponds to a factor of @xmath189 improvement over existing measurements  ( wolfe , gawiser & prochaska  2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that the angular dependence of the ps breaks degeneracy between the different parameters , allowing @xmath17 , @xmath190 , @xmath0 , and @xmath155 to each be measured from the fitting .",
    "in addition , the departure from the underlying shape of the ps allows the value of @xmath145 to also be constrained .",
    "we note that by including the uncertainties in the ap effect ( through @xmath0 and @xmath155 ) , our derived uncertainties for non - cosmological parameters ( @xmath108 , @xmath153 and @xmath145 ) include the uncertainty in the underlying matter power spectrum .",
    "an exception is that the uncertainty in the ps amplitude ( which is proportional to the normalization of the primordial ps , @xmath191 ) is degenerate with @xmath17 .",
    "however , since the error in @xmath17 is comparable to or larger than the fractional error in @xmath191 , this does not add additional uncertainty relative to the constraints shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "an important additional uncertainty may also be introduced through the uncertainty in the primordial ps index or through a running spectral index , which we have not considered in this study .    at @xmath192",
    "the neutral fraction constraints are improved over the assumed prior information from the igm .",
    "the mass of the dla hosts is constrained to high precision ( tens of percent , wyithe  2008 ) , with more accurate estimates at lower redshifts .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath145 is constrained to be smaller than a few hundredths ( with minimal redshift dependence ) , although this in not at a level comparable to the physically expected value of @xmath193 .",
    "thus , on scales larger than the mean - free - path , the perturbation due to the ionizing background ( @xmath194 ) is constrained at a level that is smaller than @xmath195 . on scales smaller than the",
    "mean free path , this perturbation is suppressed by @xmath196 .",
    "the cosmological constraints follow from the precision with which the distortion of the 21 cm ps ( as described by @xmath0 and @xmath155 ) can be measured .",
    "we find that distortions owing to the assumption of an incorrect cosmology could each be constrained at a percent level .",
    "= 5.9 in      before concluding we show for comparison ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) the constraints on the parameter set @xmath184 for optimistic high redshift cases ( @xmath197 and 15 ) , where we assume @xmath198 and fluctuations dominated by the density field ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "these cases have fitted parameters @xmath200 , and correspond to the igm prior to the formation of galaxies and ionized bubbles .",
    "the smaller @xmath17 at @xmath201 relative to the pre - reionization epoch is offset by the galaxy bias factor enhancement as well as the growth of structure , and by lower foreground contamination . with respect to constraining cosmological parameters",
    ", we find that the post - reionization 21 cm ps would be competitive with the most optimistic expectations for the 21 cm ps at high redshift .",
    "in this paper we have derived the 21 cm power spectrum ( ps ) following the completion of reionization .",
    "our approach is to derive the ps within the formalism that has been developed to calculate the 21 cm ps during reionization  ( barkana & loeb  2005 ; mcquinn et al .  2006 ; mao et al .",
    "2008 ) . by framing the derivation this way we are able to directly compare the relative merits of cosmological constraints from 21 cm surveys at redshifts prior to and post reionization .",
    "we have derived expressions for the components of the post - reionization 21 cm ps that are due to the density field , the ionization field , and their cross - correlation . as is the case prior to reionization",
    ", we find that these components contribute to the observed ps in proportions that depend on the angle relative to the line - of - sight along which the power is measured .",
    "however , in difference from the situation prior to reionization , we have shown that all components of the 21 cm ps are directly proportional to the ps of the underlying matter fluctuations , with a small but predictable modulation on scales below the mean - free - path of ionizing photons .",
    "we have derived the form of this modulation , and have shown that its effect on the observed ps will be at less than the 1% level for physically plausible astrophysical models of dla systems .",
    "the simplicity of the 21 cm ps after reionization stands in contrast to the astrophysical uncertainty during the reionization epoch , where hii regions dominate the 21 cm signal .",
    "this simplicity will enhance the utility of the 21 cm ps after reionization as a cosmological probe ( loeb & wyithe 2008 ) by removing the need to separate the ps into physical and astrophysical components ( barkana & loeb 2005 ) .    to illustrate the utility of the 21 cm ps after reionization as a cosmological probe",
    ", we have examined the alcock - paczynski  ( 1979 ) test .",
    "our calculations show that the next generation of low - frequency arrays could measure the angular distortion of the ps to around @xmath202 at @xmath134 .",
    "it has previously been shown that the scale of baryonic acoustic oscillations , which constitutes a standard ruler  ( blake & glazebrook  2003 ; seo & eisenstein  2005 ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "2007 ) , can be also be used to independently probe @xmath203 and @xmath159 in 21 cm ps , and hence to measure the equation of state of the dark energy  ( wyithe , loeb & geil  2008 ; chang et al .",
    "2007 ) . with the caveat that non - linear evolution of the 21 cm ps must be quantitatively understood , our simple analysis indicates that the precision achievable via the alcock - paczynski  ( 1979 ) test using the 21 cm ps after reionization could be better than those available via a 21 cm fluctuation measurement of the acoustic scale of baryonic oscillations for a given observing strategy ( shoji , jeong & komatsu 2009 ) .",
    "more generally , our analysis shows that the 21 cm ps after reionization shares the same favorable features as a galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the advantage of using 21 cm fluctuations lies in the fact that individual sources need not be resolved .",
    "this would allow ps measurements using 21 cm fluctuations to be extended to higher redshifts .",
