    "spatio temporal self - organized patterns @xcite can spontaneously emerge in a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "a small perturbation of a homogeneous fixed point can for example amplify , as follows a symmetry breaking instability seeded by diffusion , and eventually yield to a steady state non homogeneous solution .",
    "these are the turing patterns @xcite , recurrently investigated in chemistry @xcite and biology @xcite .",
    "the majority of studies devoted to the turing instability consider two , mutually interacting , species .",
    "more specifically , and following the customarily accepted paradigm , one species activates the production of the other , this latter acting through an inhibitor feedback .",
    "systems of three @xcite simultaneously diffusing species have been also considered and shown to display a rich zoology of possible patterns and instabilities .",
    "patterns can also develop if only one species is allowed to diffuse in the embedding medium , provided the system is composed of at least three coupled species @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is well known @xcite that two species systems where only one species can migrate , can not undergo turing instability .",
    "models however exist which fall within this category @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is of general interest to theoretically explore the possibility of bifurcation patterns of such systems , beyond the classical turing framework .",
    "this paper aims at elaborating along these lines , by considering the generalized concept of stochastically driven patterns .",
    "reaction - diffusion systems are in fact generally studied by resorting to deterministic mathematical models .",
    "the continuum concentrations of the interacting species is hence monitored over space and in time . as opposed to this",
    ", one can develop an individual based description of the scrutinized dynamics , which effectively accounts for the inherent discreteness of the system .",
    "stochastic contributions , stemming from finite size corrections , can thus modify the idealized mean field picture and occasionally return alternative scenarios to interpret available data .    in a series of recent publications , the effect of the intrinsic noise",
    "was indeed shown to create stochastic patterns , in a region of the parameters for which macroscopically ordered structures do not occur .",
    "when the deterministic dynamics predicts a stable homogeneous state , the stochastic component can amplify via a resonant mechanism , giving birth to stochastic turing patterns @xcite .",
    "the effect of finite size fluctuations can be characterized with numerical simulations , but also analytically with a mathematical technique , known as van kampen system size expansion .",
    "this allows to expand the governing master equation , which accounts for the role of demographic fluctuations . at the first order of the expansion ,",
    "the deterministic mean - field model is obtained , while the second order contributions form an equation for the stochastic fluctuations .",
    "working in this context , we will consider a simple birth and death model , with two species , of which one can diffuse .",
    "the reaction rates are assumed to be generic non linear functions of the concentration amount .",
    "conditions for the emergence of stochastic turing patterns are derived . more concretely",
    ", stochastic turing patterns can materialize if the power spectrum of fluctuations has at least a peak for a non zero spatial wave number @xmath0 for @xmath1 , the fourier time frequency , equal to zero .",
    "we will here prove that a non trivial maximum of the power spectrum exists , if the system matches specific conditions that we shall mathematically characterize .",
    "the validity of our conclusions are tested for a simple non linear model , which falls in the general class of models inspected . with reference to this specific case study , we perform stochastic simulations through the gillespie s algorithm and confirm a posteriori the adequacy of the predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will prove that , over a continuum support , the turing instability can not take place for reaction - diffusion models with two interacting species of which only one is allowed to diffuse @xcite .",
    "if space is instead discrete , turing like pattern can in principle take place , but only if the non diffusing species acts as a self - activator .",
    "however , when the condition for the instability are met , the most unstable mode @xmath0 is always located in @xmath2 , a trivial consequence of the imposed discretization . as we shall here demonstrate , accounting for the intrinsic finite size fluctuations allows one to obtain a more complex landscape of possible instabilities . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we introduce the stochastic birth and death model that we shall use as a reference case study .",
    "the model is completely general and the reaction rates are assumed to depend on the species concentration , via generic non linear functions .",
    "then , in section [ s4 ] , we first derive the mean - field deterministic limit : the only request that we shall put forward has to do with the existence of a stable fixed point for the aspatial mean - field system .",
    "we then proceed to derive the fokker - planck equation that describes the fluctuations . from this , in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we calculate the power spectrum of fluctuations , and find the mathematical conditions for having stochastic turing patterns .",
    "we turn in section [ s6 ] to considering a particular non - linear model , to verify the correctness of our predictions .",
    "finally , in section [ s7 ] we sum up and conclude .",
    "let us start by considering two species respectively characterized by the continuum concentrations @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath5 stands for the spatial variable and @xmath6 represents time .",
    "imagine the following general system to rule the dynamics of the concentrations : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the standard laplacian operator and the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 account for the interactions among the species .",
    "as anticipated we are focusing on the specific case study where just one species , specifically @xmath11 , is allowed to diffuse , @xmath12 denoting its diffusion coefficient .",
    "notice that @xmath13 is also function of the spatial variable @xmath5 , as it depends on the concentration @xmath11 , the species which can in turn migrate .",
    "we shall here assume that a fixed point of the homogeneous system exists .",
    "this is a uniform solution @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 constants , such that @xmath18 .",
    "we shall furthermore assume that the fixed point ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) is stable .",
    "in the following we will prove that no turing instability can occur , if just one species can diffuse .    to this end",
    "we consider a small perturbation @xmath19 of the initial homogeneous stationary state , in formulae : @xmath20 since @xmath21 is by hypothesis small we can linearize system ( [ syst_general ] ) around the fixed point and so eventually obtain : @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the time derivative of @xmath19 and @xmath24 is the jacobian matrix defined as : @xmath25 where e.g.  @xmath26 stands for @xmath27 evaluated at the fixed point @xmath28 .",
    "similar definitions apply to the other entries of the matrix @xmath24 .    to solve the above system ( [ eqxw ] ) , subject to specific boundary conditions , one can introduce the eigenfunctions @xmath29 of the laplacian , such that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a suitable ( unbounded ) spectral set",
    ". then we expand @xmath33 where the constants @xmath34 refer to the initial condition .",
    "this is equivalent to performing a fourier - like transform of the original equation .",
    "the function @xmath35 , also called dispersion relation , controls the growth ( or damping ) of the perturbation .",
    "more specifically the solution of the linearized system ( [ eqxw ] ) exists if @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the determinant and @xmath38 a simple calculation yields : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the trace .",
    "since we are interested in the growth of unstable perturbations , we have here selected the largest @xmath41 .",
    "the turing instability occurs if one can isolate a finite domain in @xmath0 for which @xmath42 . in formulae :    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    the right hand side contribution in equation is positive as the homogeneous fixed point is supposed to be stable .",
    "if @xmath47 it is clear that does not admit solutions , the left hand side of the equation being negative . at variance , when @xmath48 we have : @xmath49 equation implies that the relation of dispersion @xmath41 is positive for all values of @xmath50 above a critical threshold @xmath51 .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 grows as @xmath0 does , the instability involving smaller and smaller spatial scales .",
    "it is therefore not possible to delimit a finite window in @xmath0 for which @xmath41 is found to be positive , and , hence , the turing instability can not take place . in conclusion ,",
    "we have here confirmed a well establish fact @xcite : a two species systems where only one species can migrate , can not undergo turing instability .",
    "let us now turn to considering the case where the spatial support is supposed to be discrete .",
    "in practice , this amounts to assume the physical space , in any dimension , to be partitioned in a large collection of mesoscopic patches , where the constituents are assumed to be uniformly mixed .",
    "the diffusion can take place between adjacent patches .",
    "the differential equations that govern the evolution of the concentration are therefore discrete in space , a setting that is for instance of interest when reaction - diffusion models are applied to ecology @xcite .    for simplicity , and without losing generality",
    ", we will hereafter consider the problem in one dimension , assuming the physical space to be segmented in @xmath52 cells , each of finite linear size @xmath53 .",
    "we label @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , the discrete concentrations , that respectively replace their continuum analogues @xmath11 and @xmath13 .    the discrete laplacian operator @xmath57 is defined as : @xmath58 and periodic boundary conditions at @xmath59 and @xmath60 will be assumed throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the transition probability per unit of time that control the migration between neighbors mesoscopic patches . in the continuum limit @xmath62 ,",
    "when @xmath63 .",
    "the discrete reaction diffusion system can be therefore written as : @xmath64    to study the onset of the instability , we operate in analogy with what has been done above and perform a spatio  temporal fourier transform of eqs .",
    "( [ r - d1d ] ) .",
    "the transform of the discrete laplacian @xmath57 reads @xmath65 . proceeding in the analysis ,",
    "one ends up with the following relation of dispersion : @xmath66 where @xmath67 . by imposing @xmath42 one obtains , after a simple algebraic manipulation , the following condition : @xmath68 as it happens for the case of the continuum , no solution of are possible when @xmath69 , namely when the non diffusing species has a self - inhibitory effect . at variance ,",
    "if @xmath70 a finite interval in @xmath0 can be found where @xmath41 is different from zero , and the system can therefore experience a turing instability which is indeed seeded by the discreteness of the spatial support .",
    "the most unstable mode @xmath71 is however found to be @xmath72 , a trivial solution which stems from having assumed a discrete spatial support .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , as expected , @xmath71 diverges to infinity when the size of the patch @xmath53 goes to zero .",
    "starting from this setting , we will work in the context of a stochastic formulation of the generic reaction diffusion system considered above and show that finite size corrections can eventually drive the emergence of turing like patterns .",
    "we will in particular specialize on the case of a model defined on a discrete lattice and assume @xmath69 . under this condition the turing patterns can not develop in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the system that we are going to study is a general two species birth - death model , in which one of the species diffuses .",
    "as already mentioned , we assume the physical space to be partitioned in @xmath52 patches , in the following . ] and label with @xmath73 their carrying capacity .",
    "the integer index @xmath74 runs from @xmath75 to @xmath52 and identifies the cell to which the species belong .",

    "a state of the system is characterized by two vectors , respectively @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the model is completely general : virtually any system composed by two species , one of each diffusing , can be cast in the form introduced above , upon a proper choice of the functions @xmath81 .",
    "we then turn to write down the master equation that governs the dynamics of the system . to this end",
    "we need to calculate the transition probability associated with each reaction : @xmath89 by introducing the following `` step operators '' : @xmath90 the master equation reads : @xmath91 p(\\vec{s},\\vec{q},t ) \\\\ & + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\omega}\\sum_{j\\in\\{i-1,i+1\\}}\\bigg[\\left(\\varepsilon_{s_i}^{+}\\varepsilon_{s_j}^{-}-1\\right)t(s_i -1,s_j+1|s_i , s_j ) \\\\ & + \\left ( \\varepsilon^{-}_{s_i }",

    "a similar plot can be obtained for the co - evolving species @xmath77 .",
    "the solid line stands for the theoretical predictions , which follows the results summarized in the tables annexed above .",
    "a transition from zone i ( one isolated peak ) to zone ii ( two symmetric peaks ) is predicted to occur at @xmath217 .",

    "the simulations are averaged over @xmath219 independent realizations .",

    "fluctuations driven patterns are stochastic in nature : as such they are not stationary , unlike their deterministic analogue .",
    "stochastic patterns continuously decay , while they are recreated by the effect of the noise @xcite . in general",
    ", the noisy nature of the patterns makes them hard to detect by visual inspection .",
    "the emergence of a length scale become often clear only via a fourier analysis .",
    "this is the case for the simple model here investigated for demonstrative reasons : the patterns emerging from one single realization are indeed masked by a large amount of noise ( data not shown ) . similar conclusion are reached in @xcite where stochastic simulations for the schnakenberg kinetics @xcite are carried out just outside the ( deterministic ) region of turing order . on the other hand , patterns can possibly become more distinct depending on the simulated model , the dimensionality of the system ( @xmath220 vs. @xmath221 ) and the structure ( lattice vs. network ) of the embedding space . for the levin - segel model @xcite studied in two dimension @xcite ,",
    "stochastic patterns are quite visible at the naked eye .",
    "similarly , robust and rather distinct patterns are found when a stochastic reaction model of the brusselator type @xcite is defined on a network topology @xcite . also , quasi ",
    "waves patterns found in @xcite for a modified version of the brusselator model with long range couplings , stand out rather clearly from one single realization of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "the search for the necessary ingredients that make stochastic pattern accessible at visual inspection , remains however an important and still open question that deserves to be further addressed .",
    "pattern formation is an important domain of study which finds many applications in distinct contexts of interest , including ecology , biology and chemistry .",
    "the turing instability is one of the mechanisms that can be invoked to explain the emergence of stationary stable , spatially ordered patterns in reaction - diffusion models .",
    "these latter are systems of coupled partial differential equations which govern the time and space evolution of the continuum concentrations of constituents . as such , reaction diffusion models are deterministic in nature .",
    "they omit the stochastic contributions that need to be included when dealing with finite populations and , in this respect , represent an idealized approach to the modeling of the inspected phenomena . the classical , deterministic theory for the turing instability",
    "requires that at least two species diffuse in a domain in which they are confined : the diffusion potentially leads to an instability in following a perturbation of a stable equilibrium of the homogeneous system .",
    "conversely , if just one species is allowed to diffuse the turing instability is always precluded , when the system is defined on a continuum support . working on a discrete lattice , turing patterns in principle develop , but just for a trivial choice of the most unstable wave number and limited to models that assume the non diffusing species to operate as a self - activator .    beyond the deterministic viewpoint , in the last few years",
    "the concept of stochastic turing instability has been introduced in the literature @xcite : discrete systems , made of a large though finite number of constitutive entities , can generate stochastic order on a macroscopic scale , as follows a resonant mechanism which self - consistently amplifies the intrinsic demographic noise . elaborating on this concept",
    ", we considered a general stochastic reaction diffusion model , with just one diffusing species , and showed that stochastic turing patterns are indeed possible also when the non mobile species has a self - inhibitory capability , i.e. a condition for which deterministic patterns are a priori excluded .",
    "general analytical conditions for the existence of the stochastically driven patterns are given .",
    "the predictions are tested numerically working with a simplified model that falls in the general class of systems for which the theory has been developed . the quantitative agreement observed between theory and simulations points to the validity of our analysis , which",
    ", we believe , could open up novel perspectives to tackle the problem of pattern formation beyond the classical deterministic picture .",
