    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments have been unveiling the properties of neutrinos  @xcite .",

    "the mixing angles and the differences between the square masses have been estimated .",
    "however , those observations do not provide a direct measurement of the absolute mass , and do not answer the question of whether neutrino is its own anti - particle ( majorana - type ) or not ( dirac - type ) .",
    "search for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) is a key experiment to reveal un - answered nature of neutrinos  @xcite . the double beta decay ( @xmath5 ) that accompanies the simultaneous emission of two electrons and two anti - neutrinos is a rare process that is an allowed transition in the standard model .",
    "another type of double beta decay that does not emit any neutrinos , @xmath1 , can occur if neutrino is massive majorana particles ( i.e. , it is its own anti - particle ) . in the @xmath1 process",
    ", the full available energy of the decay is carried by the two electrons and the recoiled daughter which has a very small amount of energy compared with that of the electrons .",
    "therefore , while the electron sum energy spectrum in the @xmath5 is continuous up to the available energy release ( @xmath6 ) , in the @xmath1 , the spectrum should have a sharp peak at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath1 would clearly demonstrate that neutrino is not dirac - type but rather is majorana - type particle . in that case ,",
    "physical processes that do not conserve lepton number would be allowed . moreover ,",
    "the absolute mass scale , so - called `` effective majorana neutrino mass '' , @xmath7 can be estimated using the @xmath1 half life @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron mass , @xmath11 is the kinematic phase - space factor calculable with reasonable precision , and @xmath12 is the model dependent nuclear matrix element . here",
    ", the majorana mass is defined as @xmath13 where the @xmath14 s are the mass eigenstates of the neutrino , @xmath15 s are the elements of the mixing matrix between the flavor states and mass eigenstates .",
    "experimentally , the measurement limit of half life is often used as the sensitivity to probe the rare event  @xcite . in a measurement with non - negligible backgrounds ,",

    "high energy resolution and detection efficiency experiment can be realized with crystal detectors containing the isotope of interest .",
    "the detector performance of recently developed low temperature detectors ( ltds ) that operate at sub - kelvin temperatures can perfectly meet the requirements by utilizing state - of - the - art detector technologies with extreme energy sensitivity , such as neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) ge thermistors , superconducting transition edge sensors ( tess ) , or metallic magnetic calorimeters ( mmcs ) @xcite .",

    "the natural abundance of @xmath25mo is 9.8%  @xcite , which is comparatively high .",
    "furthermore , enriched @xmath25mo can be produced by centrifugation method in amount of tens of kilograms per year with a reasonable price .",
    "also , the theoretically estimated half life of @xmath25mo is relatively shorter than that of other @xmath1 candidates  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath5 of @xmath28ca with @xmath29 kev ( despite rather low concentration of the isotope @xmath30 ) can be an irremovable background source in the roi of @xmath25mo .",

    "a patterned gold film was evaporated on one side of the crystal to serve as a phonon collector .",

    "when their energy becomes 20 - 50 k , they can travel ballistically in the crystal @xcite .",
    "the major down - conversion processes of these athermal phonons are isotope scattering , inelastic scatterings by impurities and lattice dislocations , and inelastic scatterings at crystal surfaces @xcite .",
    "these excess phonons eventually change the equilibrium thermal phonon distribution , thereby causing temperature increase .    in the detector setup with the camoo@xmath0 crystal and the gold phonon collector film",

    "the size of the gold film and number of gold wires were chosen based on a thermal model study that considered the efficient athermal heat flow process  @xcite .",
    "consequently the gold film had a diameter of 2 cm , a thickness of 200 nm , and an additional gold pattern of 200 nm thickness on top of the gold film . to increase the lateral thermal conductivity of the gold film .",
    "the detector assembly was installed in a dilution refrigerator in an over - ground laboratory at kriss ( korea research institute of standards and science ) .",

    "the detector with an mmc operates well in the temperature range of 10 - 50 mk .",
    "the signal size increases at lower temperatures since the mmc sensitivity enhanced and the heat capacities decreased .",
    "however , the signals have slower rise and decay times at lower temperatures as thermal conductances become poorer .",
    "larger signal size improves the energy threshold and baseline energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the energy resolution of the detector measured for particle absorption events can be worse than the baseline resolution because of any uncorrelated mechanism that affects the signal size and shape .",
    "examples of such mechanisms include temperature fluctuations due to instrumental instability or frequent event rates , position dependence of signal shapes , or scintillation processes that are associates with phonon generations in an inhomogeneous way .",

    "the signals are normalized for their pulse height , and shifted in time to align the maximum point of signals . ]    the pulse - shape discrimination ( psd ) between @xmath3 and @xmath38 particles can be realized with the mean - time as a pulse shape parameter due to the difference in the rise and decay times of the two types of events .",
    "a similar tendency of psd was reported for other low temperature scintillating detectors  @xcite .",

    "a slowly decaying scintillation mechanism would cause slow generation of phonon in the camoo@xmath0 crystal . @xmath3 and @xmath4 particle events may have different fractions of slow component for phonon generation .",
    "this difference in slow phonon generation at mk temperatures may induce different pulse shapes for @xmath3 and @xmath4 particle events .",
    "because athermal phonon absorption in the phonon collector significantly contributes to the signal size  @xcite , the signals have some degrees of position dependence for their pulse height and shape . in this detector ,",
