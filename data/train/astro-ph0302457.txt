    "the underlying assumption behind the virial black - hole mass estimate is that the motion of the broad - line emitting material in agn is virialized . under this assumption",
    "the width of the broad lines can be used to trace the keplerian velocity of the broad - line gas , and thereby allow an estimate of the central black - hole mass via the formula @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the broad - line region ( blr ) radius and @xmath5 is the keplerian velocity of the blr gas .",
    "currently , the most direct measurements of the central black - hole masses of powerful agn are for 17 seyferts and 17 pg quasars for which reverberation mapping has provided a direct measurement of @xmath4 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan ( 1999 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) respectively .",
    "an important result of these studies is the discovery of a correlation between @xmath4 and the monochromatic agn continuum luminosity at 5100 ( eg .",
    "@xmath6 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . by combining this luminosity based @xmath4 estimate with a measure of the blr velocity based on the fwhm of the h@xmath7 emission line , it is now possible to produce a virial black - hole mass estimate from a single spectrum covering h@xmath7 .",
    "this technique has recently been widely employed to investigate how the masses of quasar black holes relate to the properties of the surrounding host galaxies ( eg .",
    "mclure & dunlop 2001 , 2002 ; laor 2001 ) and the radio luminosity of the central engine ( dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; lacy et al . 2001 ) .    however",
    ", because the h@xmath7 emission line is redshifted into the near - infrared at a redshift of @xmath8 , it is observationally expensive to use h@xmath7 to estimate the black - hole masses of @xmath9 quasars , with the vast majority of current studies concentrating on samples at @xmath10 . in this proceedings",
    "we summarize the evidence presented in mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) which suggests that the combination of 3000 continuum luminosity and mg  ii fwhm can provide a reliable uv virial mass estimator in the redshift range @xmath11 from straightforward optical spectroscopy .",
    "1.1a . shows our analysis of the @xmath12 relation at 3000 using a combined sample of 34 quasars and seyfert galaxies with reverberation mapping measurements of @xmath4 ( rm sample , kapsi et al .",
    "2000 ; wandel et al .",
    "the uv luminosities of the quasars are calculated from the data of neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , while the uv luminosities for the seyfert galaxies are derived from our analysis of archival iue spectra .",
    "the bisector fit is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "1.1a , and is equivalent to : @xmath13^{(0.47\\pm0.05)}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is in units of light - days .",
    "we note here that the slope of the @xmath14 relation ( @xmath15 ) is entirely consistent with that expected for a constant ionization parameter ( 0.5 ) .",
    "furthermore , the scatter around the @xmath14 relation is smaller than that associated with the established relation based on 5100 luminosity ( see mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) for details ) .",
    "the main reason for adopting mg  ii as the uv tracer of blr velocity is that , like h@xmath7 , mgii is a low - ionization line .",
    "furthermore , due to the similarity of their ionization potentials , it is reasonable to expect that the mgii and h@xmath7 emission lines are produced by gas at virtually the same radius from the central ionizing source .",
    "this assumption is directly tested in fig .",
    "1.1b . which shows a plot of mg  ii fwhm versus h@xmath7 fwhm for the 22 objects with reverberation mapping results ( rm sample ) for which it was possible to obtain mg  ii fwhm measurements .",
    "1.1b confirms that the fwhm of mg  ii and h@xmath7 do follow a 1:1 relation .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "firstly , it allows us to directly adopt the @xmath4 estimates from the correlation between @xmath4 and 3000 continuum luminosity . secondly , because the line - widths of mg  ii and h@xmath7 should trace the same blr velocities , we are able to simply substitute the fwhm of mg  ii for that of h@xmath7 in the virial mass estimator      having determined the @xmath16 relation and the 1:1 scaling between h@xmath7 fwhm and mg  ii fwhm , we are now in a position to derive our uv black - hole mass estimator . in fig .",
    "1.2 we show the reverberation mapping black - hole mass estimate versus the new uv mass estimate , which uses the @xmath14 relation to estimate @xmath4 and the mgii fwhm to trace the blr velocity .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "1.2 is the bisector fit to the data , excluding mrk 335 , and has the form : @xmath17 , consistent with a linear relation . in light of this , the dashed line in fig .",
    "1.2 shows the best - fitting linear relation which is adopted as our final calibration of the uv virial mass estimator . in terms of a useful formula",
    "the final calibration of the uv black - hole mass estimator is therefore :      excluding mrk 335 , the mean difference between the reverberation and the uv estimator is : @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "provided the rm sample is representative of broad - line agn , we conclude that the uv black - hole estimator can reproduce the reverberation black - hole mass to within a factor of 2.5 @xmath21 .      in fig .",
    "we show the optical black - hole mass estimator plotted against the new uv black - hole mass estimator for a combined sample of 150 objects , comprising 99 from the large bright quasar survey ( forster et al .",
    "2001 ) , 29 from the radio - selected molonglo quasar sample ( baker et al . 1999 ) and the 22 objects of the rm sample . also shown",
    "is the bces bisector fit to the lbqs and mqs objects which has the form : @xmath22 which , as expected , is perfectly consistent with a linear relation . in fig . 1.3b we show a histogram of @xmath23 for the 128 objects from the lbqs and mqs .",
    "the solid line shows the best - fitting gaussian which has @xmath24 .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that , compared to the traditional optical black - hole mass estimator , the new uv estimator provides results which are unbiased and of equal accuracy .        *",
    "the correlation between @xmath4 and 3000 continuum luminosity is found to display less scatter than the established correlation with 5100 luminosity , and to be consistent with the @xmath25 relation expected for a constant ionization parameter . * combining the @xmath26 relation with the fwhm of mg  ii produces a virial black - hole mass estimator based on rest - frame uv observables which is capable of reproducing black - hole masses determined from reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath20 ) * an application to objects from the lbqs & mqs demonstrates that the new uv black - hole mass estimator produces results which are unbiased , and of equal accuracy to the established optical ( h@xmath7 ) black - hole mass estimator ."
