    "comets are thought to contain the most primitive material left over from the planetesimal building stage of the sun s protoplanetary disk .",
    "their physical and chemical composition provides an important link between nebular and interstellar processes @xcite .",
    "a fundamental goal of cometary research is to understand the origin and nature of cometary nuclei , in order to explore how they link back to the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the most abundant constituent of a cometary nucleus , water , is difficult to detect in ground - based observations due to interference from the earth s atmospheric water vapor .",
    "however , many other molecules in cometary atmospheres can be detected , and these can be used to trace the distribution and kinematics of gas production from a comet . of particular interest are parent molecules ( those sequestered in the cometary nucleus ) , which sublime directly from the nucleus .",
    "measurements of parent molecule production rates can reveal relative abundances in the nucleus itself and therefore provide information about the conditions under which the comet formed .",
    "there are at least two distinct long - term reservoirs for cometary nuclei , the oort cloud and the kuiper belt . measuring the composition from each of the reservoirs",
    "may shed light on their origins in the protoplanetary disk from which they formed .",
    "radio interferometers possessing broad bandwidth coverage coupled with high spectral and spatial resolution can be used to examine spatial differences among parent molecules to probe the heterogeneity in the coma and nucleus ( e.g. , blake et al . 1999 )",
    ". simultaneous sampling of multiple parent molecules can test variations of abundances and abundance ratios associated with changes in the active area ( mumma & charnley 2011 ) .    however , it is not straightforward to determine the composition of a comet without directly sampling the nucleus",
    ". instead , we typically measure the coma emission of parent and daughter species released from the nucleus .",
    "this technique , while powerful , presents at least two problems .",
    "the first is that it is usually difficult to obtain spatial information on multiple species simultaneously , which is critical for the determination of abundance ratios due to the variable nature of comets ( e.g. , outflow asymmetries and jet activity ) .",
    "the second is that the chemical composition in the coma is not necessarily representative of the composition of the nucleus .",
    "for example , chemical reactions in the coma can affect the coma composition ( e.g. , hnc is likely to be formed in situ via chemistry in the inner coma ( mumma & charnley 2011 ) ) .",
    "more seriously , thermal processing of the comet surface is expected to lead to preferential volatile loss , resulting in a gradient in composition with depth beneath the physical surface .",
    "sublimation then proceeds from a range of depths , depending on the volatility of the ices , their permeability to gas flow , and the progression of thermally conducted heat moving into the interior .",
    "the gases escaping from the heated surface may not be representative of the bulk composition of the ices measured deep in the nucleus .",
    "jupiter family comets likely originated in the kuiper belt reservoir , although the precise source region within the kuiper belt remains unclear @xcite .",
    "they have short orbital periods and average residence times in the inner solar system of @xmath10.4 myr @xcite .",
    "volatile loss in previous orbits makes it especially difficult to determine their initial composition from observations of their comae ; they can be very hard to observe because of their usually weak emission , and repeated passes near the sun deplete volatiles from the surface and near - surface of the nucleus .",
    "however , a cometary outburst potentially provides the opportunity to release fresh , minimally altered material from the interior of the nucleus . the unexpected outburst of jupiter family comet 17p / holmes in 2007 provided just such an opportunity to detect and study fresh material from the comet s deeper layers .",
    "in this paper , we present submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of the outburst of 17p / holmes , in which the brightness increased from apparent magnitude @xmath1317 on ut 2007 october 23.3 @xcite to @xmath14 2.0 on ut 2007 october 25.0 @xcite , corresponding to the sudden ejection of ( 2 to 90)@xmath1510@xmath16 kg of material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use simultaneous imaging of hcn and co from the outburst to identify two different components in the molecular emission .",
    "these components exhibit drastic differences in volatile composition as measured by co / hcn , suggesting that one component samples pristine material from deep in the nucleus .",
    "observations of 17p / holmes were made on four consecutive days between 2007 october 26th and 29th using the sma eight antenna interferometer located atop mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the sma operates in the 1.3 and 0.86 mm atmospheric transmission windows which cover rotational transitions from a variety of important cometary volatile species , such as hcn , co and cs .",
    "the sma was used in the compact configuration , resulting in a spatial resolution of 2.5@xmath0 at 349 ghz and 4@xmath0 at 221 ghz , corresponding to 2950 and 4730 km in linear scale at the earth - comet distance of 1.63 au .",
    "the primary beams are 31.2@xmath0 and 49.8@xmath0 fwhm , respectively .",
    "the sma operated in a double - sideband ( dsb ) mode with an intermediate frequency band of 46 ghz which was sent over fiber optic transmission lines to 24 overlapping digital correlator bands ( or `` chunks '' ) covering the 2 ghz spectral window .",
    "phase - switching techniques were used to separate and simultaneously recover both sidebands , resulting in 4 ghz of total coverage ( 2 ghz per sideband ) .",
    "doppler - tracking of 17p / holmes was performed so that the rapidly changing velocity of the comet , as defined by available ephemerides at the time of observations ( specifically , jpl orbital solution # k077/6 , horizons system ) , was compensated for in real time , so the velocity reported here is under the cometocentric velocity frame . at all frequencies ,",
    "simultaneous dust continuum measurements were made using the line - free chunks .",
    "tables 1 and 2 summarize the observational parameters for the continuum and spectral line setups used for each date of observation . in particular , observations on october 26 , 28 , and 29 focused on hcn and either co or cs near 349 ghz , while those from october 27 aimed to detect h@xmath3co , h@xmath3s , ch@xmath7oh and the deuterated species hdo and dcn near 221 ghz .",
    "calibration of visibility phases and amplitudes was achieved with periodic snapshots of the quasar 0359 + 509 at 20 minute intervals .",
    "measurements of uranus provided an absolute scale for calibration of the flux densities .",
    "the derived mean flux densities of 0359 + 509 at the time of the observations were 2.05 jy at 349 ghz and 3.25 jy at 221 ghz .",
    "all data were phase- and amplitude - calibrated using the mir software package.cqi/mircook.html ] continuum and spectral line maps were then generated and cleaned using the miriad software package .",

    "the velocity shift of co 32 is not as obvious on 26th but it does show a similar extension as the hcn residual on 28th .",
    "the volatiles in the narrow - line component likely share the same origin in the outbursting coma of 17p / holmes . the p.a . of the red / blue gradient of",
    "the narrow emission changed gradually from 66 to 30@xmath18 during the period of observations .",
    "although in the same sense , this is a much larger shift than that of the p.a . of the line toward the sun , which only changed from 41.0 to 36.9@xmath18 .",
    "we propose that the ( residual ) hcn , co , and cs emission of the narrow component may come from volatiles released from very small grains of pure ice freshly released from the nucleus . without absorptive dust , the ice warms up at a much slower rate .",
    "co might be released faster than hcn and cs ( presumably a product of cs@xmath3 in the ice ) , accounting for the morphological difference between co and cs ( and the hcn residuals ) .",
    "we hypothesize that the narrow - line component originates from the ice grain halo found in the near - nucleus photometry which is believed to be created by sublimating ice grains around the nucleus due to the outburst ( stevenson & jewitt 2012 ) . based on time - series photometry of 17p / holmes before the outburst , snodgrass et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated a rotation period for 17p / holmes of @xmath67 h. if the change of the p.a .",
    "of the narrow - line component was caused by the rotation of the nucleus , the gradual change from 66 to 30 degrees from 26th to 29th implies a nucleus rotational period of 11.8 h ( clockwise in the plane perpendicular to the line of the sight ) or 12.2 h ( anti - clockwise ) .",
    "we discuss the nature of this narrow - line component further in the discussion section .      here",
    "we investigate the co / hcn ratios within the two components based on the data obtained on 2007 october 28 , which had the finest spectral resolution for both hcn 43 and co 32 . for hcn ,",
    "the parameters of the broad - line component come from the best - fit symmetric outgassing model as described above , by fitting the data avoiding the velocity range from @xmath660.2 to + 0.4 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the best - fit production rate is 8.0@xmath15 10@xmath68  s@xmath9 and the expansion velocity 0.44 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the narrow - line component is retrieved from the residual hcn emission after subtraction of the best - fit symmetric outgassing model .",
    "figure  [ fig : oct28 ] and [ fig : oct28hcn ] show the simulated hcn images and spectra of the two components compared with the data .",
    "as shown in the figures the narrow - line component mainly emits over the velocity range of @xmath660.2 to + 0.4 km / s , which is consistent with the co emission obtained simultaneously .",
    "this indicates that most of the co emission , if not all , must originate from the narrow - line component .    in order to estimate how much the broad - line component contributes to the co emission",
    ", we make use of the emission avoiding the velocity range from @xmath660.2 to + 0.4 km  s@xmath9 , similar to the hcn analysis .",
    "however , since the signal is too weak for the co emission , we integrate the emission with velocity between @xmath660.8 to + 0.8 km  s@xmath9 , again avoiding the velocity range from @xmath660.2 to + 0.4 km  s@xmath9 , which is clearly dominated by the narrow - line component .",
    "figure  [ fig : oct28co ] shows the integrated intensity image , which does not show any significant emission left with the noise level at 0.09 jy  beam@xmath9  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the upper limit of the broad - line component contribution can be obtained by simulating co emission with the same broad - line expansion velocity as determined in hcn emission , i.e. , 0.44 km  s@xmath9 , and matching the 1@xmath56 integrated flux level within the same velocity range .",
    "this is achieved with q@xmath69 = 5.0@xmath1510@xmath58  s@xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig : oct28co ] compares the integrated intensity of the simulated image with that of co data and figure  [ fig : wide ] demonstrates the broad - line components of hcn 43 and co 32 , compared with the data .",
    "the co / hcn ratio in the broad - line component is therefore @xmath10 7 .",
    "note that the upper limit of the co 32 broad - line component contributes 0.3 jy  km  s@xmath9 in the velocity range from @xmath660.2 to 0.4 km  s@xmath9 , which is about 1/6 of the total integrated intensity of co 32 emission .    in order to obtain the co / hcn ratio in the narrow - line component ,",
    "we first simulate hcn emission based on the hcn residual , using the same symmetric outgassing model described above , only with much smaller expansion velocity .",
    "however we only fit on the integrated flux based on the spectra , as we can not reproduce the spatial shift across the nucleus position .",
    "although not ideal , this approach should give a reasonable estimate of the abundance ratio , as long as co and hcn are treated in the same way .",
    "fitting the residual hcn spectra yields a production rate of q@xmath51 = 1.0@xmath1510@xmath68  s@xmath9 and expansion velocity 0.15  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "assuming there is no contribution of the broad - line component to the co line , we find q@xmath69 = 4.5@xmath1510@xmath58  s@xmath9 to match the integrated intensity of 1.75 jy  km  s@xmath9 for co 3 - 2 with an expansion velocity of 0.15  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "this results in a co / hcn ratio of 45 .",
    "if we consider a maximum contribution of the wide component to the co line equal to the upper limit derived above , i.e. , 0.3 jy  km  s@xmath9 , we find q@xmath69 = 3.5@xmath1510@xmath58  s@xmath9 to reproduce the integrated intensity of 1.45 jy  km  s@xmath9 , and a co / hcn ratio = 35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : resid ] shows the narrow - line components of hcn 43 and co 32 , compared with the co data and residual hcn spectra .",
    "since the unknown contribution from the broad - line component dominates the uncertainty of the calculation , we conclude that the ratio of co / hcn in the narrow - line component can be constrained to 40@xmath85 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the co / hcn@xmath70 found for the broad - line component . using the same analysis",
    ", we determine the ratio co / hcn @xmath10 9 for the broad - line component and 45@xmath810 for the narrow - line component on october 26 .",
    "this is consistent with the result on october 28 , despite larger uncertainties due to the fact that the spectral resolution of hcn and co lines carried out on october 26 is a factor of two worse than on october 28 , which creates large uncertainties in how much the broad - line component contributes to the co emission on october 26 .",
    "hcn is the molecule which exhibits the lowest abundance variation from comet to comet ( biver et al .",
    "2002 ; mumma & charnley 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , production rates relative to that of hcn can be used for a comparative study of molecular abundances . from a study of a sample of 24 comets , biver et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that co / hcn varies from @xmath1024 to 180 .",
    "in particular , 4 long period comets show co / hcn@xmath7185 while 4 other comets , including one short period comet , show co / hcn@xmath1040 . however , there is still no obvious correlation between the dynamical class and the chemical composition of comets ( biver et al .",
    "2002 ; crovisier , 2007 ) .",
    "we find in the near - nucleus outgassing of comet 17p / holmes , the co / hcn ratio is much higher in the narrow component than the broad one .",
    "the difference of co / hcn ratios in the two components demonstrates the heterogeneity of the nucleus of this jupiter family comet .",
    "the decrease in the hcn production rates indicates an @xmath72folding time @xmath14 days in the october 26 to 29 period ( table 4 ) .",
    "schleicher ( 2009 ) measured the decline of the production rates of optical species . from their table 3",
    "we find an @xmath72folding time @xmath114 days in the 2007 november to 2007 december period , with an indication that the fading timescale increases as time passes up to their last observation in 2008 march .",
    "interestingly , their cn production rate , @xmath73 = 27.4 on november 1 , is higher than the hcn production rate @xmath74 = 27.1 we derived four days earlier ( october 28 ) when matching the whole flux of hcn 43 emission .",
    "this inequality could be an artifact of the use of the haser model ( which applies to a coma expanding in steady state and which may not accurately describe the outburst coma of 17p ) or it could be an indication that cn has a parent in addition to hcn .",
    "furthermore , the photometer entrance apertures used in the optical measurements , ranging from 24 to 204 arcsec , are different from the primary beams ( 31 arcsec ) used in our observations .",
    "this could also contribute to the difference in production rates derived for the cn and hcn molecules .",
    "what are the two components in the near - nucleus coma of the outbursting 17p / holmes ? as shown from the above model fitting , the hcn emission from the broad - line component can be fit with symmetric outgassing with an expanding velocity about 0.5 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "drahus et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and snodgrass et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that an almost - spherical dust coma expanded around the nucleus of 17p / holmes at 0.55 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "both the expansion velocity and symmetric outgassing pattern of the broad - line component appear to be related to this spherical dust coma releasing dust from the surface of the nucleus .",
    "however , within the dust coma , bright streaks emerged from the nucleus , likely produced by fragments that moved away from the nucleus with velocities of up to 0.1 km  s@xmath9 ( trigo - rodriguez et al .  2007 ; stevenson et al .",
    "gaillard et al .  ( 2007 ) also postulated that the streaks originated from disintegrating cometary fragments .",
    "the images from hubble telescope s wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) also showed a `` bow tie '' appearance , about twice as much dust lies along the east - west direction as along the north - south direction , similar to the morphology we have detected in the narrow - line component .",
    "we find the production rate from the broad - line component of hcn 43 decreased but the whole integrated intensity of the line actually increased from october 28th to 29th , which implies that the narrow - line component should have increased .",
    "coupled with the increase of the mm continuum flux level between the two days , this provides strong evidence for disintegrating cometary fragments continuously supplying the dust and gas near the nucleus .",
    "so we believe the narrow - line component detected in the sma spectral line imaging shown here should associate with volatiles sublimating from the fragments near the nucleus which was the most recently ejected and most pristine in nature .",
    "the main problem with this interpretation is how long these streaks / fragments persisted .",
    "stevenson & jewitt ( 2012 ) presented the near - nucleus photometry over a period of three months following the outburst of comet 17p / holmes and they found a halo consisting of freshly released icy grains persisted around the nucleus and extended to radii of several thousand kilometers , encompassing the emission area we detected . in our interpretation , the narrow - line component likely originated from this halo , with volatiles continuously supplied from the freshly released icy grains .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2009 ) suggested that only clean ice grains , with @xmath1010% impurities , could survive long enough to travel 3500 km from the nucleus before sublimating , which could explain the offsets from the nucleus seen in the narrow - line component as in emission of co , cs and hcn residuals .",
    "the line width of the narrow - line component does not change much with time over the four days of observations , compared to the rapid narrowing of the expansion velocity of the symmetric outgassing component .",
    "this is consistent with the long lifetime of the halo feature found by stevenson & jewitt ( 2012 ) .",
    "the jupiter family comet 17p / holmes underwent a dramatic outburst in 2007 , providing us with a rare opportunity to access fresh material released by the powerful outburst from beneath the thermally - processed surface .",
    "we have observed 17p / holmes with the sma from october 26 through october 29 2007 at a spatial resolution of @xmath13000 km at the comet distance and found peculiar outgassing in the near - nucleus coma .",
    "our key results include the following .    1 .",
    "we find two components in the molecular emission from the near - nucleus coma : one has relatively broad linewidth ( @xmath11 km s@xmath9 fwhm ) , showing a symmetric outgassing pattern with respect to the nucleus position .",
    "the other has a narrow linewidth ( @xmath100.5 km s@xmath9 fwhm ) .",
    "hcn 43 emission has both components , while the emission of cs 76 and co 32 is dominated by the narrow - line component .",
    "the morphologies of the two components are different : the peaks of the broad - line component in the hcn 43 emission are on the nucleus position and do not change with velocity ; the line center of the narrow - line component is red - shifted by 0.10.2 km s@xmath9 ( cometocentric frame ) .",
    "the peaks of the emission shift with velocity across the nucleus position and the position angle of the red / blue gradient changed from @xmath11 to @xmath12 during the four days of observations .",
    "we determine distinctly different co / hcn ratios for each of the components : co / hcn @xmath107 in the broad - line component and co / hcn=40@xmath85 in the narrow - line one .",
    "this different line ratio reflects the heterogeneity of the nucleus of this jupiter family comet .",
    "we determine the @xmath75/@xmath76 ratio=80@xmath816 based on the simultaneous observations of hcn and h@xmath2cn 43 emission , which is consistent with the terrestrial value .",
    "these observations demonstrate the unique power of radio interferometers with high spatial and spectral resolution to map small scale spatio - kinematic differences in emission of primary volatiles in the near - nucleus cometary comae to probe the heterogeneity in the nucleus .",
    "simultaneous observations of multiple primary volatiles are key to understanding and interpreting the outgassing properties of the nucleus . the newly constructed atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array , or alma , will allow to assess the composition of a large sample of comets to examine its relationship with cometary formation region .",
