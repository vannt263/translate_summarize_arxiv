    "let @xmath9 be the hilbert space of pure three - qutrit states .",
    "up to multiplication by a scalar , every three - qutrit state @xmath10 can be considered as a point of the projective space @xmath11 ( @xmath12 will denote a projective space of dimension @xmath13 ) .",
    "separable states of @xmath14 are states that can be factorized as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "the set of separable states is indeed the set of tensors of rank 1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the single - qutrit computational basis and we denote by @xmath18 the three - qutrit basis .",
    "thereby , we write a general three - qutrit state @xmath10 as :    @xmath19    let @xmath20 be the group of stochastic local operation and classical communication ( slocc ) of three - qutrits ( acting on @xmath21 ) , we have @xmath22 .",
    "the group @xmath20 acts transitively on the set of separable states . the corresponding orbit , which is the equivalence class of @xmath23 for the equivalence relation defined by    @xmath24    is also called the highest weight orbit .",
    "its projectivization is the unique smooth orbit @xmath0 for the action of @xmath20 on @xmath21 , more precisely :    @xmath25    we can parametrize this unique smooth orbit @xmath0 using the segre embedding @xcite of three projective planes :    @xmath26    with @xmath27,[y_0:y_1:y_2],[z_0:z_1:z_2])\\\\=   [ x_0y_0w_0 : \\dots : w_j : \\dots : x_2y_2z_2]\\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the monomials are ordered according to the value in base 3 of their indexes , such that @xmath30 iff @xmath31 .",
    "let us introduce the notion of hyperplane to implement our construction .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 , a linear form on @xmath14 defined by the state @xmath7 via the inner product on the hilbert space .",
    "the hyperplane @xmath32 is the zero locus of @xmath5 , i.e. is the set of states @xmath33 such as @xmath34 .",
    "then we construct the hyperplane section @xmath35 , that is the restriction of @xmath5 to @xmath0 .",
    "in other words this hyperplane section is the set of separable states on which @xmath5 vanishes .",
    "let @xmath36 be the linear form defining the hyperplane @xmath4 .",
    "then the hyperplane section @xmath35 will be , according to the segre map ( see eq .",
    "( [ segreeq ] ) ) , the @xmath3-hypersurface of @xmath0 given by    @xmath37    the corresponding @xmath3-hypersurface may be smooth or have singularities . because the variety @xmath0 is @xmath20-homogeneous the singular types of the @xmath3-hypersurface and the @xmath38-hypersurface are the same for any @xmath39 . in other words",
    "the singular type of the @xmath3-hypersurface is a slocc invariant of the state @xmath7 .",
    "therefore it is natural to look at the entangled classes and characterize them in terms of the singularities of the corresponding @xmath3-hypersurfaces . in particular",
    "if we restrict our attention to those @xmath3-hypersurfaces which have only isolated singularities , then we can use classification results from singularity theory .",
    "in particular in the article we show that only a few types of isolated singularities can be obtained by this construction in the case of three - qutrit systems .",
    "we prove :    [ proposition1 ] let @xmath35 be a singular hyperplane section of the algebraic variety of separable states for three - qutrit systems , i.e. @xmath40 , defined by a quantum pure state @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 only admits simple or nonisolated singularities .",
    "moreover if @xmath43 is an isolated singular point of @xmath35 , then its singular type is either @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath8 .",
    "the construction employed by the authors was already used to get a finer grained classification of the four - qubit classification by the first author ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this construction is inspired by a construction due to f. knop @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec . [",
    "sing ] we recall some basic facts about singularity theory to explain how the calculations leading to theorem [ proposition1 ] are performed . then in sec .",
    "[ result ] we prove theorem [ proposition1 ] . in sec .",
    "[ onion ] we look at the hierachy of entangled classes given by singular types . sec .",
    "[ conclu ] is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we first recall the definition of simple singularities of complex analytic functions following arnold s classification of simple singularities @xcite .",
    "arnold s caracterization of simple singularities leads to a pratical way of computing the singular type of those as it was done in @xcite .",
    "we then show how to proceed on two examples .      the segre variety @xmath47 being a rationnal algebraic variety , the @xmath3-hypersurfaces will be defined by complex homogenous polynomials .",
    "the definition ( and classification ) of simple singularities following arnold is given in the more general situation of ( germs of ) holomorphic map @xmath48 .",
    "a point @xmath49 is said to be a * critical * point of a holomorphic function @xmath50 if at that point @xmath43 the derivatives of @xmath50 equal zero .",
    "a critical point is said to be a * nondegenerate * or a * morse critical * point iff the second differential of the function at that point is a nondegenerate quadratic form i.e. iff the hessian matrix of @xmath50 at the critical point is of full rank .",
    "the * corank * of a critical point of a function is the dimension of the kernel of its second differential at the critical point .",
    "let us consider now the set @xmath51 of function - germs at the point 0 @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the group of germs of biholomorphic maps @xmath54 .",
    "this group acts on the space @xmath51 by the rule @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then , the orbits for this action are exactly the equivalence classes of function - germs .",
    "two function - germs at zero are said to be * equivalent * if one is taken into the other by a biholomorphic change of coordinates that keeps the point zero fixed .",
    "we can now define a singularity by :    two critical points are said to be * equivalent * if the function - germs that define them are equivalent .",
    "the equivalence class of a function - germ at a critical point is called a * singularity*.    from the definition , it follows that the corank of a singular point will be an invariant of the equivalence class defining the singularity .",
    "thus a singularity will be nondegenerate or quadratic or of morse type if and only if its corank is zero .",
    "two function - germs @xmath58 and @xmath59 are said to be * stably equivalent * if they become equivalent after the addition of nondegenerate quadratic forms in supplementary variables : @xmath60    this definition allows us to compare degeneracies of critical points of functions of different numbers of variables .",
    "adding quadratic terms of full rank in new variables do not affect the classification of the singular type .",
    "there exists another invariant of singularities usefull to distinguish between singularity types with the same corank .",
    "this invariant is the milnor number , also called the multiplicity of the critical point , and it is defined by introducing the following quotient :    the * local algebra @xmath61 of the singularity of f * is defined to be the quotient of the algebra of function - germs by the gradient ideal of @xmath50 :    @xmath62    with @xmath63 , the gradient ideal generated by the partial derivatives @xmath64 of the function @xmath50 .",
    "the multiplicity of the critical point , i.e. the milnor number @xmath65 of a singular germ @xmath66 , is equal to the dimension of the local algebra of @xmath66 , @xmath67    it can be shown that a critical point is isolated if , and only if , @xmath68 .",
    "simple singularities were defined by arnold as the class of singularities which are stable in the following sense .",
    "a singularity @xmath69 is said to be simple if and only if a ( sufficiently ) small perturbation of the singularity generates only a finite number of non - equivalent classes .",
    "it is clear from the definition that a morse singularity @xmath69 is simple as any funtion @xmath70 ( for a small @xmath71 ) will be either nonsingular or with hessian matrix of full rank .    in his classification of simple singularities",
    "@xcite , arnold proved that being simple is equivalent to the following conditions :    * @xmath68 * @xmath72 * if @xmath73 , then the cubic term in the degenerate direction of the hessian matrix is non - zero * if @xmath74 and the cubic term is a cube , then @xmath75 .    with those conditions arnold obtained the classification of simple singularities into five different types , two infinite series , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and three exceptional ones , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , leading to the well - known classificiation of simple singularities ( table [ table ] ) :    .normal forms of simple singularities [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parameter free family of nurmiev s classification is called the nullcone and contains only nilpotent orbits . geometrically",
    "the nullcone @xmath81 is a variety of dimension @xmath82 given by the zero locus of the three generators of the algebra of slooc - invariant polynomials on @xmath83 . in other words",
    "the states of the nullcone annilhate all three - qutrit invariant polynomials .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion on invariants and covariants of three - qutrit states and also @xcite for an analysis of the nullcone in the four - qubit case .",
    "quantum states slocc - equivalent to @xmath84 are semisimple states and are the most stable states in the sense that perturbing the state @xmath85 will not change the family of that state . from our perspective",
    "this can also be understood from the fact that @xmath86 is a smooth hypersurface and that a small perturbation of a smooth hypersurface will still give a smooth hypersurface . in this respect",
    "the hypersurface having only simple singularities are the next most stable ones .",
    "following arnold s definition of simple singularities , the knowledge of the singular type of a @xmath3-hypersurface provides information about the possible deformations of the singular hypersurface under a small perturbation .",
    "in particular the miniversal deformation of a @xmath8 singularity gives singularities of type @xmath87 and @xmath44 according to the adjacency diagram ( eq ( [ adj ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath88 thus from the entanglement nature of the states corresponding to the normal forms @xmath89 ( resp .",
    "@xmath90 ) , we can infer that a small perturbation of the state will lead to states of type @xmath91 ( resp .",
    "@xmath92 ) , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath84 .",
    "the study of the singular type of the @xmath3-hypersurface can also be reinterpreted in terms of singular locus of the dual variety of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the dual variety @xmath95 is the ( algebraic closure of the ) set of tangent hyperplanes , i.e. @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the tangent space of @xmath0 at @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath98 , the variety @xmath95 is a slocc - invariant hypersurface called hyperdeterminant of format @xmath99 ( see @xcite for the theory of hyperdeterminant in general and @xcite for the @xmath99 hyperdeterminant in particular )",
    ". the hyperdeterminant can be used , as suggested by miyake @xcite , to describe classes of entanglement by looking at the singular locus of this slocc - invariant hypersurface .",
    "the smooth points of the hypersurface correspond to hyperplanes defining hyperplane sections with a unique morse singularity ( the hyperplanes which do not belong to the hypersurface define smooth hyperplane sections , they correspond to states of type @xmath100 , as mentioned above , for a general choice of parameters ) .",
    "then there are two types of singular points : either they form a node component @xmath101 ( the corresponding hyperplane section has several isolated singular points ) or they form a cusp component @xmath102 ( the singular hyperplane section is not a morse singularity ) .",
    "those defintions were introduced by weyman and zelevinsky @xcite and later on used by miyake in the context of entanglement @xcite .",
    "a result of dimca @xcite and parusinski @xcite insures moreover that the multiplicty of a hyperplane ( seen as a point ) of the dual variety equals the sum of the milnor numbers of the corresponding hyperplane section . therefore table [ semisimple ] tells us that , for instance , the state @xmath103 belongs to @xmath104 ( the set of node points of multiplicity @xmath105 ) while @xmath106 belongs to @xmath107 .",
    "therefore our results allows us to describe the stratification induced by the singular point of @xmath95 .",
    "it provides an onion - like structure , following the words of miyake , to describe the three - qutrit entanglement ( see figure [ qutritentanglement ] ) .    in this picture the stratification of the ambiant space by slocc invariant subvarieties can directely be read from the singular locus of @xmath95 .",
    "in this paper we employed the classification of simple singularities to look at the three - qutrit entanglement following the approach of @xcite .",
    "this allows us to identify the nurmiev s normal forms as components of the singular locus of the dual variety of the set of separable states .",
    "this stratification provides an onion - like description of the classes of entanglement for the three - qutrit case . back to the simple singular types which show up in table [ nilpotent ] and table [ semisimple ] ,",
    "it is quite surprising to see that the worst isolated singular point is of type @xmath8 .",
    "it was already the case observed in @xcite for the four - qubit case .",
    "however in the four - qubit case the appearence of the @xmath8-type was expected in the sense that the lie group @xmath108 , of dynkin diagram @xmath8 , plays a major role in the orbit classification of four - qubit entanglement @xcite .",
    "thus in this case the @xmath8 singularity was providing an @xmath109-type correspondence between lie group and singulariy of the same @xmath109 dynkin diagram .",
    "in @xcite this correspondence could be clearly understood from the expression of the @xmath110 hyperdeterminant , i.e. the dual equation of the variety of separable states , which could be written in the form of the discriminant of the miniversal deformation of a @xmath8 singularity . in the case of three - qutrit",
    "the correspondence is more mysterious and a direct relation between the expression of the @xmath99 hyperdeterminant , as calculated in @xcite , and the discriminant of the minversal deformation of @xmath8 is still missing .",
