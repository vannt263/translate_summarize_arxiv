    "the electron energy spectrum is squeezed into the set of landau levels slightly broadened due to the interaction with scatterers . for surface electrons ( se ) on liquid helium , the broadening of landau levels is extremely narrow , usually much smaller than temperature , which is the origin of the unconventional hall effect observed in this system under different experimental conditions  petschlea94,leafozric94,monteswyd99 .",
    "the se can be confined in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels , when the helium surface is curved by capillary forces in the presence of a specially constructed dielectric substrate  @xcite .",

    "there is also an interesting evidence for the self - organized current filaments in the helium microchannels  gladotfoz01 .",
    "the confining potential affects crucially the energy spectrum of electrons subject to the magnetic field @xmath1 , because it removes the degeneracy of landau levels . for example , in 2des the landau spectrum does not depend on the orbit center coordinate @xmath2 , and it is purely discrete @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron momentum along the @xmath5-direction , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the magnetic length and @xmath8 is the cyclotron frequency defined in terms of the free electron mass @xmath9 . in contrast , for the parabolic confining potential @xmath10 , the electron energy spectrum under the magnetic field has a continuous term depending on the electron momentum along the channel  sokstu95 : @xmath11where @xmath12the orbit center coordinate @xmath13 ( here @xmath14 is the typical electron localization length across the channel ) is determined by the interplay of the magnetic field and the confining potential .",

    "the important advantage of these methods is that the electron conductivity along the channel can be quite generally expressed in terms of the electron dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath23 , which allows to track the origin of the strong dependence of the electron mobility on the magnetic field .",
