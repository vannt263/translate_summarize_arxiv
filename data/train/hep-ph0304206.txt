    "energy dependence of multiplicity distribution ( md ) of particles produced in high energy collisions of hadrons and nuclei is important issue of multiparticle dynamics @xcite . though md contains information about particle correlations in an integrated form it provides general and sensitive tool to probe the dynamics of the interaction .",
    "analysis of the multiplicity data from @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions will be thus important part of the physics programme at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . in this new energy domain",
    "some basic questions concerning md remain still open .",
    "current theoretical understanding of the interplay between soft and semihard mechanisms of particle production is insufficient to provide reliable estimates even of the elementary quantity characterizing probability distribution @xmath2 of the @xmath3-particle event - the average multiplicity of particles @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 produced in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "different scenarios vary over a  wide range of values @xcite . notwithstanding such uncertainty ,",
    "large multiplicity of particles makes it feasible to study specific characteristics of md which are relevant to fractal properties of the multiparticle dynamics .",
    "fractality is usually connected with investigations of multiplicity in limited intervals of phase - space and demonstrated as a power - law in resolution dependence of the multiplicity moments @xcite .",
    "such behaviour is characteristic for effects of nonstatistical fluctuations @xcite and/or intermittency @xcite . besides fractality",
    ", there exists evidence in favour of multifractality @xcite in the structure of inelastic events .",
    "some authors brought suggestions @xcite that the property could be expressed in simple thermodynamic terms .",
    "namely , it was shown @xcite that constant specific heat , widely used in standard thermodynamics , reflects multifractal character of various stochastic systems in a reasonable approximation . in hadronic interactions ,",
    "its constancy relative to the q - order number of the multifractal characteristics ( the generalized dimensions ) was indicated in ref .",
    "universality of the multifractal specific heat with respect to various hadron - nucleus reactions was demonstrated @xcite by means of the method proposed by takagi @xcite .",
    "though exploiting similar variables and methods supports multifractal interpretation of data , conclusion about the methodology is far from being unique .",
    "in such situation , alternative approaches to the above aspects of multiparticle production are also needed .",
    "they can be helpful in better understanding of multifractality in high energy collisions and useful in extracting dynamical origin of its basic phenomenological observation - the power law dependence of the corresponding measures with respect to the fractal resolution .",
    "in this paper we employ and further extend our earlier study of md @xcite based on robust characteristics of md such as shannon s _ information _ entropy @xmath6 and its generalization , rnyi s order - q _ information _ entropy @xcite @xmath7 for which @xmath8 . they contain information on the multiplicity moments @xmath4@xmath9@xmath10 in a non - trivial way .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we show how regularities in energy dependence of the shannon entropy provide independent constraint on the energy dependence of @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to multifractal interpretation of observed regularities in terms of the rnyi s order - q entropy .",
    "we use three different monte carlo ( mc ) generators of high energy proton - proton collisions , hijing @xcite , nexus @xcite , and psm @xcite to study energy dependence of md up to the lhc energies . results of mc simulations are reported in section 4 .",
    "summary and discussion of the results is presented in section 5 .",
    "entropy is important characteristic of systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "it seems quite natural to use it in description of high energy multiparticle production processes .",
    "in particular , entropy of md is an effective variable characterizing inelastic collisions with many particles produced .",
    "the simple relation @xcite @xmath11 between the entropy @xmath12 and the average multiplicity @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 is valid with good accuracy for large enough @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is related to the probability @xmath14 by the formula @xmath15 the kno scaling @xcite of md postulates energy independence of @xmath13 what can be expressed according to eq .",
    "( [ s_lnn ] ) as follows @xmath16 last relation implies that all _ information _ about the energy dependence of md is contained in its first moment @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 .",
    "such behaviour was indeed observed in hadron - hadron collisions up to the isr energy range @xcite .",
    "however , beyond this range , the kno scaling of md of charged hadrons produced in @xmath17 collisions was shown to be significantly violated @xcite . the observed scaling violation , i.e. break down of eq . ( [ kno ] ) results via eq .",

    ".  1 . here , due to the charge conservation , @xmath19 is half of the average multiplicity of charged particles .",
    "recently published tevatron data @xcite from @xmath20 collisions are also included in the figure .",
    "the values of the difference ( [ s_lnn ] ) show clear increase with energy and thus confirm violation of the kno scaling observed at lower isr energies .",
    "let us note that increase of @xmath18 can not continue ad infinitum .",
    "it was shown @xcite that this difference is asymptotically bounded by unity from above .",
    "the extremal value of the r.h.s . of the relation ( [ s_lnn ] ) is obtained from the principle of maximal entropy applied to all continuous functions @xmath13 .",
    "if the functions ( [ kno1 ] ) satisfy the conditions @xmath21 valid for all normalized md with given @xmath22 , the extremum is reached for the kno function @xmath23 which corresponds to the geometrical distribution .",
    "the difference @xmath24 is thus bounded from above by the expression which is calculated for the geometrical md .",
    "the bounding values are represented by the curve in fig.1 .",

    "on closer inspection , however , one can see that @xmath32 calculated form e735 data is systematically above the ua5 values .",
    "it is connected with higher tails of the e735 md as compared to the ua5 data .",
    "the discrepancy might be due to the sizable systematic uncertainty in both e735 and ua5 since in both experiments the full phase space md were obtained by computer simulation from data measured in a restricted range of rapidity .    as the bounding value in ( [ bound ] ) tends to unity , the observed monotonous increase of the entropy @xmath36 ,",
    "if valid at higher energies , will also govern the energy dependence of @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 : @xmath37 such asymptotic power law behaviour of the average multiplicity should be contrasted with other approaches to multiparticle production .",

    "let us note that multifractality besides predicting @xmath55 to be decreasing functions of @xmath47 does not , in general , provide any further information about the @xmath47-dependence of the spectrum of the generalized dimensions @xmath55 .",

    "regular behaviour of this type is expected to occur for multifractals for which , in classical analogy with specific heat of gases and solids , the multifractal specific heat @xmath67 is independent of temperature @xcite in a wide range of @xmath47 .",

    "the shift is due to larger values of @xmath32 for e735 data , as already shown in fig .",
    "as pointed in the previous section , the discrepancy in intercepts is connected with systematically larger high multiplicity tails of the data from tevatron when compared to the data from the cern @xmath72 collider .",

    "note that this number practically coincides with the slope obtained from the electron - positron multiplicity data @xcite what is indicated by the full line in fig .",
    "since our study concerns the full phase space and it is performed in a different sense than the usual intermittency analysis , we obtain smaller value of @xmath67 in comparison with the specific heat ( @xmath75 ) determined from multifractal properties of the factorial moments @xcite . while the multifractal specific heat reported in ref .",
