    "two of the most prominent issues to be addressed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking  ( ewsb ) and the nature of dark matter ( dm ) which , according to recent results of the wmap experiment , makes up roughly 20% of the energy density of the observable universe .",
    "the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics , when extended to include massive neutrinos , is extremely successful at describing the observations made at past and present experiments , including many nontrivial precision tests . despite these achievements",
    ", it fails to provide a candidate for cold dm in the form of a stable , weakly interacting particle species , but at the same time predicts a scalar higgs particle which so far has eluded detection at the lep and tevatron experiments .",
    "in addition , the minimal higgs mechanism is theoretically unappealing due to the severe fine tuning required by quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs potential .",
    "it is probably not a coincidence that all of the problems mentioned above , the observed dm relic density @xmath1 and the shortcomings of the standard ewsb scenario , strongly point to a modification and/or extension of the sm at the tev scale which is thus within reach of the lhc experiments .",
    "we take the apparent absence of the sm higgs boson below @xmath2 gev and the cosmological evidence for weakly interacting stable particles at or below the tev scale as a motivation to consider an alternative scenario which relates both issues , namely a supersymmetric formulation of higgsless models in a warped extra dimension in which the properties of the gaugino dark matter candidate are closely tied to the mechanism which produces the electroweak gauge boson masses .",
    "we have introduced the model setup in @xcite including a discussion of the virtues of the lightest neutralino modes as a cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect_model ] we give a short review of the model including the superfield content , the boundary conditions imposed to obtain a realistic light spectrum , and some key properties .",
    "we discuss the parameters which have an important impact on lsp phenomenology at the lhc , and define a set of benchmark points in parameter space . in section  [ sect_lhc ] we discuss promising channels for an observation of missing energy from lsp pair production .",
    "our conclusions are based on the simulation of four parton final states at the lhc with whizard  @xcite .",
    "we propose sets of kinematical cuts and present the corresponding results for a range of model parameters . in section  [ sect_conclusions ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the model  @xcite on which we base the following discussions is an extension of the warped higgsless model proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the 5d gauge group is @xmath3 with the corresponding 5d gauge coupling constants @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the full symmetry is conserved in the bulk and broken by boundary conditions to @xmath7 and thus only @xmath8 survives as an unbroken subgroup .",
    "matter hypermultiplet masses are generated on the ir brane as usual where they are allowed by the @xmath9 symmetry , while the isospin doublets are split by majorana masses and localized kinetic terms on the uv brane where @xmath10 is broken .",
    "since the smallest spinors in 5d are of dirac type , there are four supercharges in 5d @xmath11 susy , which can be related to 4d @xmath12 susy .",
    "however , half of the symmetries are broken by the background , leaving us with usual @xmath11 susy after kaluza - klein expansion .",
    "nevertheless , we assume that full 5d hypermultiplets with corresponding interactions are present in the bulk of the extra dimension in such a way that full 5d susy spectra appear at energies @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding action of hypermultiplets coupled to 5d super yang - mills theory broken by a warped background can be expressed by ordinary @xmath11 chiral- and vector superfields  @xcite . the resulting superfield content with representations and quantum numbers",
    "is summarized in table [ fig_sfields ] .",
    "each hypermultiplet has a bulk mass @xmath14 parameterized in units of the randall - sundrum curvature @xmath15 which acts as a localization parameter for the entire multiplet .    .[fig_sfields ]",
    "the superfield content of the model and corresponding representations and quantum numbers with respect to the bulk gauge group @xmath16 . here",
    ", @xmath17 denotes vector superfields , @xmath18 denotes chiral superfields in the adjoint as they appear in @xmath12 vector multiplets , and @xmath19 the denotes the chiral superfield component of the matter hypermultiplets .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the generation . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sm background @xmath21 is only moderately large .",
    "the classes of diagrams contributing to the signal at this order are shown in figure  [ fig_qqprod ] for initial quarks and in figure  [ fig_ggprod ] for initial gluons .",
    "in addition to the standard cuts @xmath22 $ ] ; @xmath23 $ ] ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 $ ] we introduce the set of cuts shown in table  [ tabcuts ] to further suppress backgrounds .",
    "the cuts on the transverse momentum of the quarks , ii.1 and ii.2 , are efficient in reducing the @xmath26 parton sm background @xmath27 . rather than imposing stronger bounds on the transverse energy of the quarks",
    ", we can use the azimuthal distance distribution .",
    "we introduce a further set of cuts to exploit the larger contribution of top quarks from lsp production which are not back to back , ii.3 . using these cuts ,",
    "we vary the quark bulk masses according to table  [ tab : pn ] , and simulate events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath28 at @xmath29 tev .",
    "the results for the final state @xmath30 are shown in figure  [ missingptsummary ] .",
    "while the masses of the lightest @xmath31 states have the largest influence on the total cross section , the branching ratio of @xmath31 to lsps determines how strong the signal will be for this final state alone .",
    "the impact of contributions from kk gluons is illustrated by the comparison between points p2 and p3 , the latter of which has vanishing lefthanded @xmath32 couplings .",
    "we find that cross sections can be reduced dramatically for exact delocalization .",
    "the remaining contributions are basically due to the production of onshell stop pairs which entails a typical @xmath33 distribution with a cutoff at twice the @xmath18 or @xmath34 momentum given by the kinematical function , @xmath35 which is approximately equal to @xmath36 for @xmath37 .    .",
    "for one set of cuts the results for quarks in the initial state are compared for two different localizations.[missingptsummary],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] . for one set of cuts the results for quarks in the initial state",
    "are compared for two different localizations.[missingptsummary],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] + .",
    "for one set of cuts the results for quarks in the initial state are compared for two different localizations.[missingptsummary],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] . for one set of cuts the results for quarks in the initial state",
    "are compared for two different localizations.[missingptsummary],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]      essentially the same statements are true for this final state , except that the sm background @xmath40 is larger ( in particular in the low @xmath41 region ) , and the signal cross section is smaller due to the large branching fraction of @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , one could use cuts i and only consider the region @xmath43 gev , but the resulting distribution has an unremarkable shape which is hard to distinguish from neutrino production .",
    "thus , this channel alone is not well suited for missing energy observations .      in the previous sections we have considered the leading order contributions to neutralino pair production in association with third generation quarks at the @xmath26 parton level .",
    "there is however another kind of events which might not be easily distinguishable from lsp production in an experiment , namely the production of chargino nlsps or of one chargino nlsp and a neutralino lsp . also , there are regions in parameter space where @xmath44 for the light third generation squarks ( in particular @xmath45 ) , making nlsp production and decay the dominant source of missing energy .",
    "our charginos are close to the lower experimental exclusion bound and decay via @xmath46 .",
    "they are very narrow ( @xmath47 ) due to the offshell intermediate @xmath48 , yet unlike in some models with light gravitino lsp , the corresponding lifetime is still negligible .",
    "the fermion pair has an energy of @xmath49 in the chargino center of mass frame .",
    "depending on how well such processes can be resolved in the experiments , this will be an important channel for the observation of lsp or nlsp production . in the detector",
    ", one might see missing energy with one lepton or comparatively soft jets ( few tens of gevs ) and two @xmath50 or @xmath34 jets , so chargino production events would look similar to the signal discussed above .",
    "we therefore close this section by studying the processes @xmath51 to which the three point couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 and for the latter also @xmath54 can make important contributions , in contrast to neutralino pair production . since the results below are for vanishing ir kinetic terms ( and thus very heavy @xmath48 and @xmath55 resonances ) , these contributions can be both enhanced due to phase space and decreased further above the energy scale at which unitarization sets in . in the case of final states with charginos",
    ", the @xmath33 of the @xmath50 and @xmath34 jets is not exactly equal to @xmath41 any more , but only up to the @xmath33 of the softer jet(s ) from the chargino decay products ( assuming @xmath56 decay into visible particles only ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath57 and chargino boosts in the lab frame is shown in figure  [ fig_chapt ] for chargino pairs and in figure  [ fig_mixpt ] for mixed chargino and neutralino production .",
    "the boost distribution of the charginos can be used to infer how hard the jets or leptons from the chargino decay products are going to be .",
    "the maximum is at around @xmath58 depending on the parameters , leading to rather soft jets , but a significant number of events can reach @xmath59 .",
    "these cross sections are even larger than those for pure neutralino production , but it is subject of further study how well this type of events can be distinguished at the lhc .",
    "the proper treatment of the background to this type of processes would require production of 8 partons in the final state to account for the three body decays of two @xmath60s via offshell @xmath48s , and possibly detector simulations which are beyond the scope of this work . in figure  [ fig_asymcomp ]",
    ", we compare the various final states for two different sets of third generation localization in which the bulk masses of the @xmath61 and @xmath10 charged hypermultiplets are exchanged . in any case ,",
    "nlsp production gives us an equally important source of missing energy .",
    "is shown as an approximation to @xmath41 which will have further contributions from the decay products.[fig_chapt],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] is shown as an approximation to @xmath41 which will have further contributions from the decay products.[fig_chapt],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +   is shown as an approximation to @xmath41 which will have further contributions from the decay products.[fig_chapt],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] is shown as an approximation to @xmath41 which will have further contributions from the decay products.[fig_chapt],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]     for different quark localizations after cuts ii.2 and ii.3 ( all mstw08 ) .",

    "the modified cuts ii.3 are ii.3 without the cut on the azimuthal angular distance to illustrate its efficiency.[missingptleptonic],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] ( predominantly ) from leptonic top decays in the sm ( all mstw08 ) .",
    "the modified cuts ii.3 are ii.3 without the cut on the azimuthal angular distance to illustrate its efficiency.[missingptleptonic],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in the detector , the final states @xmath62 , @xmath63 or @xmath64 as they appear in the processes discussed above , if one or both tops decay leptonically , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 ( e.g. from top pair production ) are not distinguishable except for their kinematics , and all produce missing energy signatures .",
    "both groups can arise from top decays and thus show the typical edge in the @xmath68 or @xmath69 invariant mass , but while the angle in the center of mass between the tops is close to 180@xmath70 in the case of pair production , the neutralinos in the signal process may produce substantial recoil .",
    "one might hope that cuts on the azimuthal angle such as cuts ii.3 favor the signal contribution . to check this",
    "we implement the cuts ii.2 and ii.3 for the visible decay products , @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the sm process @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , we introduce a separation cut @xmath74 for the two @xmath50 quarks which reduces the sm background from initial quarks by half .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ missingptleptonic ] .",
    "apparently , the angular cut in combination with @xmath33 cuts is indeed efficient , reducing the missing energy background from leptonic decays down to @xmath75 .",
    "however , when comparing the signal contributions to this , one has to consider that only a fraction of the top pairs decay purely leptonically .",
    "we have given a short overview over our supersymmetric warped model and an application to the ewsb sector of higgsless models as introduced in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the presence of a realistic cdm candidate and naturally light third generation squark resonances in this model , we have simulated the production of the lsp and nlsp in association with third generation quarks with respect to their missing energy signatures using an implementation in whizard .",
    "indeed , the production of the lightest @xmath31 and @xmath45 resonances is the most important factor in this class of processes at the @xmath26 parton level .",
    "consequently their mass , which depends on the third generation hypermultiplet bulk mass parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 , determines the order of magnitude of cross sections .",
    "since the nlsps are very light in our model , the final states involving @xmath78 and @xmath60 are equally important , the relative strength in each case being determined by the branching ratios of @xmath45 and @xmath31 decays .",
    "while the decay products of the nlsp should in principle be observable as jets or leptons with energies below @xmath79 gev depending on the mass splitting @xmath80 , we have used for simplicity the transverse momentum of the nlsps as an approximation to @xmath41 .",
    "taking into consideration the leading sm background at the @xmath26 parton level , @xmath81 , we find that cuts on the transverse momenta of final state quarks are an efficient means of increasing the signal to background ratio .",
    "depending on the particular decay mode of the tops one is interested in , missing energy from the resulting neutrinos can become the dominant sm background .",
    "we have illustrated this with a short analysis of the purely leptonic decay mode of sm top pair production , and have demonstrated how this contribution can be reduced using @xmath33 and angular cuts .",
    "again , this background drops quickly at large @xmath41 , and allows us to observe lsp production in the region @xmath82 gev .",
    "the strength of the signal strongly depends on the quark localization parameters both in the first and third generation . for the following results we have assumed the cuts ii.2 , restricting the quark transverse momenta to @xmath83 gev . for our benchmark points p1 , p2 featuring one rather light @xmath45 and @xmath31 resonance , we find a signal cross section of @xmath84 fb for the combination of all final states involving @xmath85 at @xmath86 tev",
    "the two points yield essentially the same total cross section and differ only in the relative importance of the various final states .",
    "it drops to @xmath87 fb at @xmath86 tev for p3 with delocalized light quarks . at p4 , which features ir localized third generation hypermultiplets , the kk mode splitting is smaller leading to heavy squarks .",
    "the resulting cross section including all final states is @xmath88 fb at @xmath86 tev .",
    "worse prospects are imaginable for more extreme ir localization in combination with delocalized light quarks .",
    "the production of neutrinos in association with third generation quark pairs contributes a background cross section of @xmath89 fb at @xmath86 tev , but mainly at missing momenta @xmath90 gev which is significantly below the cutoff of @xmath91 at @xmath92 for most of the parameter space . in our discussion",
    "we have not considered more complex backgrounds , detector effects or misattributions of final states in detail .",
    "however we argue that one can apply the discussions from the literature on @xmath31 and @xmath45 production  ( e.g.  @xcite ) to our case , keeping in mind that additional contributions from the kk sector in warped models can enhance signal cross sections significantly .",
    "the production of heavy intermediates with @xmath93 tev suffers severely from reduced parton densities in the large @xmath94 region at center of mass energies below @xmath95 tev as they are scheduled for the first run of the lhc .",
    "for example , after cuts ii.2 and p2 , the cross section @xmath96 drops by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "fortunately , the same is true for sm neutrino production , thanks to the strong @xmath33 cut .",
