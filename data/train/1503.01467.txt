    "a rotating magnet in vacuum is the simplest description of a rotating neutron star , or pulsar .",
    "the magnet loses its energy to magnetodipole radiation @xcite . however , real pulsar magnetospheres are likely filled with plasma @xcite , which supports charges and currents that modify the pulsar spindown . for a long time",
    "it has been realized that plasma - filled magnetospheres open up to infinity due to relativistic rotation @xcite .",
    "the open magnetic flux carries away the spindown luminosity of the star in the form of a pulsar wind .",
    "whereas the origin of spindown luminosity of vacuum rotators has been well - understood due to the availability of the analytic model , the spindown of plasma - filled magnetospheres can only be studied numerically , and progress became possible only recently .",
    "the primary difficulty in computing pulsar magnetosphere structure is in connecting the conditions on the star to the properties of the emerging pulsar wind .",
    "of particular importance is the determination of the twist of magnetic field lines at the stellar surface , or the magnitude of the electric current flowing through the magnetosphere .",
    "early pulsar magnetosphere solutions prescribed the magnitude of the twist , and , as a result , the solutions extended smoothly only to the _ light cylinder _",
    "radius @xcite , the distance from the rotational axis at which a field line rigidly rotating at the frequency of the central object would move at the speed of light , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is pulsar angular frequency and @xmath2 is the period .    in real magnetospheres ,",
    "the magnitude of the magnetospheric current is set self - consistently by the large - scale properties of the magnetosphere .",
    "the rotation of the star twists the magnetic field lines , which sends out a torsional alfvn wave that carries the twist outward . on the way out , the alfvn wave undergoes partial reflections that reach back to the star and modify the surface value of the magnetic field twist , which determines the strength of the magnetospheric current .",
    "it is accounting for this communication by alfvn waves and determining the correct value of the magnetospheric current that was the challenge .",
    "@xcite found an iterative way to determine the strength of the magnetospheric current self - consistently .",
    "they obtained the first solution for an _ aligned _ force - free pulsar magnetosphere that extended out to infinity .",
    "their results were subsequently verified by other groups within force - free and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximations ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as using a particle - in - cell ( pic ) approach @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out the first 3d , oblique pulsar magnetosphere simulations . using the force - free approximation , he found that pulsar spindown luminosity increases with increasing obliquity angle , @xmath3 , the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes .",

    "what sets the spindown luminosity of plasma - filled pulsars remains elusive .",
    "understanding this and constructing a detailed , 3d model of a pulsar wind are the goals of this work .",
    "we start with a discussion of pulsar spindown in the split - monopole approximation and confront it with the numerical simulations in  [ sec : dependence - spin - down ] , discuss the effects of pulsar wind non - uniformity on pulsar spindown rate and develop a toy model of a non - uniform pulsar wind in  [ sec : non - unif - puls ] . we construct an analytic description of aligned and orthogonal plasma - filled pulsar winds in  [ sec : appr - solut - align ] .",

    "it matches the simulated luminosity well .",
    "the non - uniformity of the open magnetic flux plays a crucial role in setting the spindown luminosity of oblique pulsars . ]",
    "our goal is to understand the physics of spindown of plasma - filled pulsars .",
    "the solid blue line in fig .  [ fig : lvsalpha ] shows the dependence of pulsar spindown on inclination ( see @xcite ) . clearly , oblique pulsars have higher spindown rates , but the reason for this increase is unclear . in the widely used and highly successful standard model of the asymptotic pulsar wind , the wind structure is radial and",
    "is that of a split - monopole outflow @xcite .",

    "that the magnetic field lines are predominantly straight suggests that the magnetospheric outflow is nearly radial .",
    "however , as indicated by non - trivial variations of @xmath9 , whose absolute magnitude would be a constant along @xmath11  constant in a split - monopole solution , this does not mean that the solution is well - described by a split - monopole ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : pwindbr ] ) . ]",
    "however , this brings up a problem : the spindown of split - monopole solution is _ independent _ of inclination ! in it , @xmath12 and is time - independent .",
    "in fact , as we will derive below ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : pdip ] ) , the spindown luminosity is set by the rotational frequency of the star , @xmath13 , and the amount of open magnetic flux in the split - monopole solution , @xmath14 where the integral is over both hemispheres and the factor of @xmath15 converts it to a single hemisphere .",

    "the open magnetic flux increases with increasing inclination angle .",
    "this increase accounts for @xmath20 of the enhancement in spindown luminosity of oblique rotators .",
    "the remaining @xmath21 come from the redistribution of the open magnetic flux toward the equatorial plane ( see  [ sec : non - unif - puls ] ) . ]",
    "a natural possibility is that the amount of open magnetic flux depends on the inclination angle , @xmath22 , and this causes the dependence of the spindown luminosity on @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : phivsalpha ] shows that while this is indeed the case to a degree , the dependence @xmath23 is too weak to fully account for the enhancement in spindown rate for oblique pulsars .",

    "but with colour showing scaled radial magnetic field , @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25prefactor eliminates the obvious radial trend : for a perfectly monopolar field , we would have @xmath26  const .",
    "the substantial deviations from constancy of @xmath24 are a strong indication that the radial magnetic field in the pulsar magnetosphere is substantially non - uniform and deviates from the simple monopolar dependence , @xmath27 . ]    as the colour variation in fig .",
    "[ fig : pwindbr ] suggests , the product @xmath28 is not constant in the simulated pulsar wind .",
    "however , the split - monopole model of the pulsar wind and the associated spindown luminosity given by equation   assume that @xmath28 is a constant everywhere , i.e. , apart from @xmath29 changing sign at current sheet crossings , @xmath29 is laterally - uniform ( i.e. , it has no dependence on @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and follows a simple power - law dependence in radius . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : pwindbr ] , this approximation is at best very rough : @xmath29 shows variations away from the expected scaling , @xmath32 , which indicates the presence of a substantial , order unity non - uniformity in the pulsar wind .",
    "can these non - uniformities lead to deviations from the spindown rate given by equation ? in section ",
    "[ sec : veloc - freeze - cond ] we will demonstrate that this is indeed the case .      to describe the asymptotic structure of pulsar wind , we will make use of the fact that the wind structure is accurately described by a 2d distribution of just a single variable , @xmath29 , in @xmath33 plane .",
    "this can be seen as follows . in ideal mhd",
    "/ force - free a pulsar magnetosphere rotates at the stellar angular frequency .",
    "thus , the velocity can be decomposed into motion along magnetic field lines with velocity @xmath34 and together with the magnetic field lines corotating with the star at @xmath35 : @xmath36 due to the ideal mhd condition , the electric field is @xmath37 .",
    "asymptotically far from the pulsar , @xmath38 , the magnetic field is toroidally - dominated , @xmath39 and moves outward at a drift velocity , @xmath40 since at such large distances the wind moves relativistically fast , @xmath41 , we have : @xmath42 using eq .",

    "reduces to the standard split - monopolar expression , eq .  .",
    "note , however , that the real pulsar wind is non - uniform laterally , and this approximation does not capture this nonuniformity .",
    "however , even despite the non - uniformity , the pulsar wind remains very nearly radial .",
    "this means that the radial scaling of @xmath29 is a trivial power - law , @xmath55 .      to make progress , we will approximate the angular distribution of @xmath29 in the open magnetic flux region by that of a dipole @xmath56 inclined at an angle @xmath3 in the @xmath57 , or @xmath58 , plane . as we will see below ,",
    "this is an excellent approximation for near - orthogonal rotators and a reasonable approximation for other obliquities .",

    "@xmath69 this is very close to the @xmath3-dependence that is observed in numerical simulations and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lvsalpha ] with the solid blue line .",
    "therefore , the nonuniformity of @xmath29 , via the magnetic flux concentration toward the magnetic poles ( i.e. , around the direction of @xmath56 ) , causes an _ enhancement in spindown losses _ at high inclination angles ( @xmath70 ) .    the qualitative behaviour given by eq .   has a clear physical interpretation . from eq .",
    "we see that energy flux is minimum near the rotational poles ( @xmath71 ) and maximum near the rotational equator ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "conversely , the spindown losses are maximised when the maximum in @xmath29 lies in the rotational equator and contributes to the spindown most efficiently ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "in other words , the spindown losses are higher than in a pure monopole because of angular redistribution of magnetic flux from the polar to the equatorial regions .    from eqs .   and",

    "this is because most of the spindown emanates near the equatorial plane , @xmath81 , as indicated by the factor @xmath82 in eqs .   and .",
    "thus , for a field line to contribute to spindown most efficiently , it needs to be close to the equatorial plane . as we tilt the pulsar , its magnetic pole , which is the region of enhanced magnetic field , approaches the rotational equator .",
    "this leads to an enhancement in the spindown .    to find out whether this mechanism is at work in the simulated pulsar magnetospheres , we compare the angular distributions of @xmath29 due to a vacuum dipole solution , given by eq .  , and in a simulation of a force - free magnetosphere .",

    "we can incorporate this feature by tilting the solution for the aligned rotator by the inclination angle , @xmath3 , as described in item [ item.i ] .",

    "eventually , for @xmath74 , the solution becomes the orthogonal solution [ see item [ item.ii ] ] without any current sheet .    on a phenomenological level , this suggests that it would be advantageous to mix the tilted solution [ item.i ] with the orthogonal one [ item.ii ] .",

    "similarly , the solution provides a rather good description of the pulsar wind at @xmath8 , for which it only slightly over - predicts ( by @xmath155 ) the width of the magnetic peak . note that the solutions at all inclination angles are qualitatively different from the split - monopole solution , which does not have any non - uniformity in @xmath30 . for the aligned rotator",

    "in this work , we analysed the results of 3d , time - dependent numerical simulations of oblique , plasma - filled pulsar magnetospheres in the mhd and force - free approximations .",
    "oblique plasma - filled pulsars spin down twice as fast as aligned pulsars @xcite , i.e. , the spindown luminosity @xmath49 varies with the inclination angle @xmath3 as @xmath163 the reasons for such an increase are not understood .",
    "could this increase be caused by the changes in the amount of open magnetic flux ? only to a degree",
    ": we found that changes in the open magnetic flux account for about @xmath164% of the increase .",
    "we argue that the other @xmath165% of the increase is due to a _ nonuniform bunching of magnetic field lines toward the equatorial plane_. this redistribution allows the field lines to extract the rotational energy more efficiently , thereby accounting for the rest of the increase in the spindown luminosity .    to illustrate this effect , we constructed a toy model , in which we approximated the angular distribution of the radial magnetic field , @xmath29 , by that of a dipole .",
    "dipole magnetic field strength peaks at the magnetic poles .",
    "as this field distribution rotates with the star , the magnetic field lines become wound up around the axis .",
    "the faster the winding of a field line , the more that field line contributes to the spindown .",
    "since the winding is slowest at the magnetic poles ( there @xmath166 ) and fastest at the equator ( @xmath167 is maximum ) , the field lines near the polar magnetic peak do not contribute much to the spindown .",
    "however , in an inclined rotator , the dipolar peak moves closer to the equatorial plane .",
    "the field lines near the inclined peak contribute to the stellar spindown more efficiently and lead to an increase in the spindown of an oblique rotator relative to the aligned rotator .",
    "we showed that the spindown luminosity in this simple model follows the dependence given in eq .",
    ", which illustrates the importance of magnetic field bunching on the spindown luminosity .",
    "the magnetic field of an actual pulsar is not dipolar .",
    "is there a quantitative way of describing the non - uniformity of magnetic field in the pulsar wind ?",
    "the good news is that it is sufficient to prescribe a single function  a distribution of @xmath29 on a sphere of a sufficiently large radius  in order to fully recover the asymptotic , 3d structure of a pulsar wind . in particular , for an aligned rotator , the distribution of @xmath29 is axisymmetric , and we parametrised it via a single scalar function ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : mhdalignfit ] ) .    at first glance",
    ", the structure of oblique rotators appears to be much more complicated than that of the aligned one .",
    "the good news is that an orthogonal force - free rotator exhibits a rather featureless and simple radial magnetic field distribution , @xmath168 , i.e. , the same as of the vacuum dipole that is put on its side ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : vacdipsol90 ] ) !    now , with these two solutions for the asymptotic pulsar wind  for the aligned and orthogonal plasma - filled rotators  at hand , we combined them into an approximate , two - component solution that describes the simulation results at all inclination angles (  [ sec : semi - analyt - solut ] ) .    that the full solution is a combination of the two components is particularly interesting for the following reason .",
    "the magnetic field in the aligned component of the solution undergoes a jump in the equatorial plane .",
    "however , the field remains smooth in the orthogonal component .",
    "this means that the relative weights with which the two solutions enter the full solution tell us about the strength of the jump in magnetic field strength and therefore the _ strength of the magnetospheric current sheet_.    as the inclination angle increases , the contribution of the aligned solution gradually decreases ( eq .  [ eq : w1 ] ) and the magnetospheric current sheet weakens , i.e. , the jump across the sheet in the magnetic field decreases .",
    "the current sheet completely disappears for a force - free orthogonal rotator , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : brsq_analyticalyaxis_map](d),(h ) .",
    "this suggests that the amount of dissipation in near - orthogonal pulsar magnetospheres might be _ qualitatively _ smaller than at intermediate obliquities .",
    "this might be the reason for lower dissipation in the current sheets found in global pic simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of a jump in the magnetic field in a force - free solution does not mean that the dissipation is entirely absent , as found in both recent 3d mhd @xcite and pic @xcite simulations of oblique pulsar magnetospheres .    whereas force - free and mhd simulations do not include the microphysics of the magnetospheric current sheets and reconnection , they are extremely useful because they can be extended to extremely large distances and give us the full , nonlinear structure of the pulsar wind electromagnetic field that is otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "in particular , they offer us a unique opportunity to determine the smooth structure of the solution outside of the current sheets and compute the spindown luminosity , its angular distribution , and its dependence on the obliquity angle of the pulsar .",
    "for instance , we find that the current sheets in our analytic description the pulsar wind are quite unusual in that the magnitude of @xmath169 undergoes a substantial jump across the sheet . since asymptotically in the pulsar wind the total ( radial plus toroidal ) lab - frame magnetic pressure is tightly related to square of the radial magnetic , @xmath65 , via @xmath170 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : eb ] ) , the lab - frame magnetic pressure also undergoes a jump across the magnetospheric current sheet",
    ".    however , having such a jump is at odds with the expectation that the total pressure ( which is dominated by magnetic pressure outside the sheets ) , must be the same on both sides of the sheet : otherwise , the current sheet would be pushed to the side with a lower pressure until the two pressures came to an equilibrium .",
    "there is a flaw in this argument : since our simulations are relativistic , we need to measure the magnetic pressure in the _ fluid _ frame , which is different than the pressure in the _ lab _ frame because the pulsar wind flows outward at a relativistic velocity , with a lorentz factor @xmath171 relative to the star .",
    "hence , it is the fluid - frame magnetic pressure , @xmath172 , that is continuous across the current sheet",
    ". how can this happen if the lab - frame magnetic pressure is discontinuous ?",
    "this can occur if the fluid elements on the two sides of the current sheet move at _ substantially different lorentz factors _ , @xmath173 , such that even though the lab - frame magnetic pressures are different , @xmath174 , the fluid - frame magnetic pressures are the same , @xmath175 .",
    "thus , that the square of the radial magnetic field , @xmath65 , undergoes a substantial jump , which we find both in our force - free and mhd simulations of oblique pulsar magnetospheres as well as in our analytic model , necessarily implies that the fluid elements on the two sides of the current sheet _",
    "move at a relativistic velocity relative to each other_. this relative motion is independent of the internal physics of the current sheet and is a generic feature of the large - scale geometry , or topology , of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "this might be interpreted as follows : the reconnection in the current sheet is a type of _ driven _ , rather than spontaneous , reconnection .",
    "thus , in order to accurately predict the properties of current sheet reconnection rate , particle acceleration , and emission , local simulations of reconnection need to be constructed for the specific geometry and type of discontinuity across the current sheet in order to properly reflect the driving exerted on the current sheet by the global magnetospheric structure @xcite . in particular , local simulations of _ driven _ reconnection are needed to properly represent the magnetospheric current sheet physics .",
    "our analytic description of the pulsar magnetosphere provides a 3d electromagnetic structure of a pulsar wind near and beyond the light cylinder for both aligned and oblique pulsars .",
    "this is useful for constructing the models of emission from the magnetospheric current sheet and modelling pulsar gamma - ray light curves .",
    "the nonuniformity of the pulsar wind and the deviations of lateral structure from the split - monopole expectation can be included into and will improve the accuracy of the models of pulsar wind nebulae @xcite , supernovae remnants , and magnetar - powered supernovae @xcite and core - collapse gamma - ray bursts @xcite . for all of these systems , if an oblique rotator is a generic situation , the emerging outflow shows smooth , sinusoidal - like variations ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig : brsq_analytical_map ] ) separated by jumps at the current sheets . because of these variations , the energy flux is more strongly concentrated toward the edges of the emerging outflow than in the standard split - monopole approximation for the pulsar wind .    in the magnetar model of core - collapse gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "a pulsar wind focuses into a pair of tightly collimated jets .",
    "if jet emission correlates with its power @xcite , variability of the pulsar wind could translate into periodic gamma - ray variability that is directly observable . in the particularly clean case of an orthogonal rotator",
    ", the emerging pulsar wind shows smooth sinusoidal  like variation at the rotational period of the neutron star that could lead to sinusoidal - like modulation of the high - energy emission . that this signature is not routinely seen in the light curves of long - duration gamma - ray bursts",
    "suggests several possibilities . the central compact object could be a black hole or a ( nearly ) aligned rotator and produce no periodic variability .",
    "if the central object is an oblique rotator , the absence of such variability might be suggestive of an emission mechanism that washes out small time - scale variability of the central engine .",
    "for instance , in sub - photospheric gamma - ray emission models ( e.g. , ) , the emission is formed over a wide range of radii , which means that the emission is sensitive only to large - scale jet structure . how gamma - ray burst emission is produced by inhomogeneous jets warrants further investigation .",
