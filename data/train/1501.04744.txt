    "a compact riemann surface @xmath0 is _ platonic _ if it admits a regular map . by a map ( or clean dessin denfant ) on @xmath0 we mean an embedding of a graph @xmath1 into @xmath0 such that @xmath2 is a union of simply connected polygonal regions , called faces .",
    "a map thus has vertices , edges and faces . a directed edge",
    "is called a _ dart _ and a map is called _ regular _ if its automorphism group acts transitively on its darts .",
    "the platonic solids are the most well - known examples of regular maps .",
    "these lie on the riemann sphere . to be more precise",
    ", we recall how we study maps using triangle groups .",
    "the _ universal map of type _",
    "@xmath3 is the tessellation of one of the three simply connected riemann surfaces , @xmath4 , the riemann sphere @xmath5 , the euclidean plane @xmath6 , or the hyperbolic plane , @xmath7 depending on whether the genus of the surface is 0 , 1 , or @xmath8 by regular @xmath9-gons with @xmath10 meeting at each vertex .",
    "this map is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the automorphism group , and also the conformal automorphism group of @xmath11 is the triangle group @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this is the group with presentation @xmath13 the orientation preserving subgroup of the extended triangle group @xmath14 generated by three reflections @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 as described in  2 .    in general ,",
    "a map is of _ type _",
    "@xmath3 if @xmath9 is the lcm of the face sizes and @xmath10 is the lcm of the vertex valencies .",
    "as shown in @xcite , every map of type @xmath3 is a quotient of @xmath11 by a subgroup @xmath18 of the triangle group @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath18 is called a _ map subgroup _ of @xmath11 or sometimes a fundamental group of @xmath11 , inside @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "thus , associated with a map @xmath19 we have a unique riemann surface @xmath20 . the map is regular if and only if @xmath18 is a normal subgroup of @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "thus , a platonic surface is one of the form @xmath20 where @xmath18 is a normal subgroup of a triangle group and @xmath4 is a simply connected riemann surface .",
    "a _ symmetry _ of a riemann surface @xmath0 is an anticonformal involution @xmath21 and a _ symmetric _ riemann surface is one that admits a symmetry , for example the riemann sphere admits complex conjugation as a symmetry .",
    "we are interested in the fixed point set of a symmetry .",
    "this is given by a classical theorem of harnack which tells us that the fixed point set of a symmetry @xmath22 consists of a number @xmath23 of disjoint jordan curves , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the genus of @xmath0 .",
    "each such jordan curve is called a _ mirror _ of @xmath22 .    on a regular map @xmath19 a special role",
    "is played by the fixed points of automorphisms of the map ( or the riemann surface ) .",
    "these are the vertices , edge - centres and face - centres of @xmath26 .",
    "we call such points the _ geometric points _ of @xmath26 .",
    "as an automorphism preserves the vertices , edge - centres and face - centres , it follows that a mirror must pass through vertices , edge - centres and face - centres .",
    "let us denote a vertex by @xmath27 , an edge - centre by @xmath28 and a face - centre by @xmath29 .",
    "this notation comes from coxeter  @xcite .",
    "if we travel along a mirror we will in succession meet a sequence of geometric points of the map , and if we have a map on a compact surface then this sequence is finite .",
    "this sequence is called the _ pattern _ of the mirror .",
    "we sometimes use the term pattern of a symmetry if the symmetry fixes a unique mirror . in @xcite ,",
    "section 4.5 the patterns of the mirrors of the regular solids are computed and displayed here in table  [ patternspherical ] in  2 .    as an example consider the dodecahedral map on the riemann sphere in figure  [ dodecahedron ] .",
    "the reflection @xmath30 fixes the equator which passes through vertices , edge - centres and face - centres giving the patten @xmath31 , which we abbreviate to @xmath32 , see figure  [ dodecahedron ] .",
    "however well before coxeter , felix klein had discussed this very idea in his famous paper where he introduced the klein quartic .",
    "this corresponds to his riemann surface of genus 3 with automorphism group psl(2,7 ) of order 168 .",
    "associated with this surface is the well - known map of type @xmath33 .",
    "the klein surface is symmetric and in section 13 of his paper klein points out that on his surface a mirror has pattern @xmath34 .",
    "( however in klein s paper ( see @xcite , p465 or @xcite , p322 ) he uses @xmath35 for @xmath36 . )    our aim is to discuss patterns for platonic surfaces in general .",
    "an automorphism of a riemann surface @xmath0 is a biholomorphic homeomorphism @xmath21 .",
    "it is known that if we have a map @xmath19 on a surface @xmath0 , then this induces a natural complex structure on @xmath0 that makes @xmath0 into a riemann surface .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "an automorphism of the map @xmath19 is a automorphism of the riemann surface @xmath0 that transforms the map to itself and preserves incidence .",
    "we let @xmath37 , @xmath38 denote the conformal automorphism group of @xmath0 , and the extended automorphism group of @xmath0 , respectively , where the extended automorphism group allows anticonformal automorphisms .",
    "similarly , we let @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the sense preserving automorphism group of @xmath19 and the full automorphism group of @xmath19 , respectively . we have @xmath41 lies in @xmath37 with a similar remark about the full groups . in most cases ,",
    "these groups coincide although there are cases where the automorphism group of the riemann surface is strictly larger than the automorphism group of the map .",
    "a regular map is called _ reflexible _ if it admits an orientaion - reversing automorphism , ( often this will be a reflection ) and then @xmath42    let @xmath0 be a riemann surface of genus @xmath25 and let @xmath43 be a regular map of type @xmath3 on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath44 be a face of @xmath43 . if we join the centre of @xmath44 to the centres of the edges and the vertices surrounding @xmath44 by geodesic arcs , we obtain a subdivision of @xmath44 into @xmath45 triangles .",
    "each triangle has angles @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and will be called a _",
    "@xmath49-triangle_. in this way , we obtain a triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "note that there are as many @xmath49-triangles as the order of @xmath40 , and the reflexibility of @xmath43 implies that @xmath40 is transitive on these triangles .",
    "let @xmath22 be a @xmath49-triangle on @xmath0 and let @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the reflections in the sides of @xmath22 , as indicated in figure  [ figuretriangle ] .",
    "these reflections satisfy the relations @xmath50 the triangle group @xmath12 $ ] is generated by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 obeying the relations @xmath54 the reflections @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 generate @xmath40 .",
    "however , the relations in ( [ presentation2mn ] ) only give a finite group if @xmath55 and hence in other cases we need at least one more relation to get a presentation for @xmath40 .",
    "the pair of any two successive geometric points on a mirror is either @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( or in reverse order ) .",
    "let @xmath59 be a @xmath49-triangle .",
    "then we see that each corner of @xmath59 either is a vertex , a face - center or an edge - center of @xmath43 .",
    "so we can label the corners of @xmath59 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "each of the pairs @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 corresponds to one of the sides of @xmath59 .",
    "we will call the corresponding sides of @xmath59 the @xmath56-_side _ , the @xmath57-_side _ and the @xmath58-_side_. see figure  [ figuretriangle ] .",
    "let @xmath18 be a mirror on @xmath0 fixed by a reflection .",
    "then @xmath18 passes through some geometric points of @xmath43 .",
    "these geometric points form a periodic sequence of the form @xmath60 which we call the _ pattern _ of @xmath18 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we call @xmath63 of ( [ pattern ] ) a _ link _ of the pattern and call @xmath64 the _ link index_. we abbreviate the pattern ( [ pattern ] ) to @xmath65 .",
    "for example , from the introduction we see that for the dodecahedron the links are all @xmath32 so the link index is 2 . for the klein map we have the same link but",
    "now the link index is 3 . as klein thought of his map as being a higher genus version of the dodecahedron it is interesting to note the similarities in their patterns !    _ as a riemann surface determines a unique map , we can talk about a pattern of a riemann surface .",
    "note that the dual map is also associated with this riemann surface but the patterns for the dual are found by interchanging @xmath27s and @xmath29s . _    we display the patterns for the platonic solids ( the regular maps on the sphere ) in table  [ patternspherical ] .",
    "most of this is from coxeter @xcite  4.5 , except for the easy cases of the dihedron and its dual hosohedron .",
    "note that in table  [ patternspherical ] , the tetrahedron , type @xmath66 or the icosahedron , type @xmath67 have only one pattern listed but for the octahedron , type @xmath68 there are two patterns listed .",
