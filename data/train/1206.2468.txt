    "the fact that these fillings are pairwise non - diffeomorphic follows from proposition  [ ext ] as in part @xmath16 in the proof of theorem  [ sim ] .    finally , for fixed @xmath182 , we show that the stein fillings described above with @xmath188 belong to the same homeomorphism type .",
    "we proved in proposition  [ hom ] that for fixed positive integers @xmath141 and @xmath1 , all the smooth @xmath16-manifolds in the infinite family @xmath189 belong to the same homeomorphism type , independent of the knot @xmath190 .",
    "now we simply claim that the knot surgery performed on @xmath162 to obtain @xmath185 essentially affects the complement of the removed neighborhood of the regular fiber union the @xmath92-sphere section , and hence it does not have any effect on the homeomorphism type of the  remaining \" stein fillings . so the strategy is to start with a homeomorphism of the closed @xmath16-manifolds including the stein fillings , and verify that it will  descend \" to a homoeomorphism of the stein fillings when we remove a piece from each after performing a fintushel - stern knot surgery .",
    "more precisely , first note that in @xmath162 , a tubular neighborhood of the @xmath92-sphere section is disjoint from the cusp neighborhood ( see the proof of proposition  [ hom ] ) including the torus @xmath90 given above .",
    "moreover , the cusp neighborhood intersects with a tubular neighborhood of a regular fiber along two disjoint copies of @xmath191 .",
    "since the initial homeomorphism in proposition  [ hom ] is identity on the complement of the cusp neighborhood , we can delete these configurations , except the two copies of @xmath191 , without affecting our homeomorphism . performing knot surgery on @xmath90 turns these two disk bundles into @xmath192 , where @xmath193 denotes a genus @xmath99 surface with one disk removed .",
    "since any homeomorphism of @xmath194 extends , we can delete these two @xmath195 as well so that the homeomorphism descends to the stein fillings .",
    "* an infinite family of exotic simply - connected stein fillings , * for each positive integer @xmath1 , an infinite family of exotic stein fillings whose fundamental group is @xmath199 , and * for each positive integer @xmath1 , a stein filling whose first homology group is @xmath200 .",
    "recall that , with respect to our notation in section  [ iso ] , @xmath197 denotes the plumbing of @xmath18 with an oriented circle bundle over @xmath22 whose euler number is @xmath201 .",
    "it follows that @xmath197 is a seifert fibered @xmath0-manifold over a genus @xmath35 surface with a unique singular fiber of multiplicity @xmath201 .    for any @xmath202",
    ", an infinite family of simply connected , homeomorphic but pairwise non - diffeomorphic stein fillings of the singularity link @xmath203 is given in theorem  [ sim ] .",
    "similarly , according to theorem  [ sima ] , for any @xmath204 , and for each positive integer @xmath1 , @xmath205 admits an infinite family of homeomorphic but pairwise non - diffeomorphic stein fillings with fundamental group @xmath4 .",
    "the third family of stein fillings is given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , none of the stein fillings in the last two items are homeomorphic to any milnor fiber of the singularity , since a milnor fiber of a normal surface singularity has vanishing first betti number @xcite .",
