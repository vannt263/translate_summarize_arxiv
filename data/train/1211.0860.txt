    "increasing the density of particles in granular matter causes them to undergo a transition from an unjammed state , where the particles can move relatively freely , to a jammed state , where almost none of the particles can move  @xcite .",
    "systems of interest in nature and in industrial applications typically have complicated geometries which strongly affect jamming in them  @xcite , and it is thus important to understand how does confinement influence the jamming of granular matter . here",
    "we investigate the effects of confinement on the jamming transition , and in particular test how does the shape of containers determine how they jam",
    ". most theoretical work so far was done on square systems @xcite .",
    "there are numerous laboratory experiments that deal with non - square systems @xcite .",
    "for example , daniels and behringer conducted an experiment on polypropylene spheres in an annulus @xcite , which is large enough to be considered a rectangle with infinite length and finite width . a different experiment by bi et al .",
    "@xcite consists of shearing a square system such that it becomes a rectangle with the same area and particle density as the original square . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of confinement on jamming by studying these phenomena in kinetically - constrained models in rectangular domains .",
    "the essence of jamming is captured by the various kinetically - constrained models @xcite . for such simple models , and for other related models",
    "@xcite , it is useful to have exact solutions .",
    "two types of kinetically - constrained models which describe granular and glassy materials are spin - facilitated models and lattice - gas models @xcite . in both types of models ,",
    "the system is represented by a grid , such that each site on the grid can have one of two values , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .    in the _ lattice - gas models _",
    ", a site with a value of @xmath5 represents a single particle and a site with a value of @xmath6 represents a vacant region . in each time step ,",
    "one particle and one of the possible directions are chosen randomly with equal probabilities . the chosen particle attempts to move in that direction , and",
    "if the kinetic constraint allows the move , the particle moves to the neighboring site in the chosen direction . for a given initial configuration , some of the particles can move from the start , and some can move only after ( many ) other particles have moved and cleared the way for them .",
    "there may also be particles that will never move , no matter how the other particles in the system move .",
    "those that will never move are called _ permanently frozen _ , and those that can move eventually are called unfrozen .",
    "[ gridex ] for an example .    in the case of _ spin - facilitated models _",
    ", a site with a value of @xmath6 represents a region of low density and high mobility , and a site with a value of @xmath5 represents a region of high density and low mobility . note that this notation is different than the common notation ( @xmath6 for a region of high density and @xmath5 for a region of low density ) , but we use this definition in order to deal with both lattice - gas and spin - facilitated models simultaneously . in each time step of the dynamics , one of the sites",
    "is chosen randomly , and changes its value at a temperature - dependent probability if it has enough neighbors with low density ( i.e. , a value of @xmath6 ) , with the exact geometric criteria depending on the specific model . in the limit of zero temperature , the only allowed changes are from high density to low density , i.e. from a value of @xmath5 to @xmath6 . for a given initial configuration , there is a possibility that even after an infinite number of time steps , some sites will still have a value of @xmath5 .",
    "these permanently frozen sites represent the backbone of the system which will never change .    in order to find the fraction of permanently frozen particles , one can use the bootstrap method , which iteratively removes mobile particles , until none of the remaining particles can move .",
    "again , we have a backbone of sites which will never change .",
    "this algorithm is obviously valid for spin - facilitated models , but also for lattice gas models , since the criteria for the mobility of particles is local , and removing a mobile particle is effectively the same as moving it far enough from its neighbors .",
    "since the algorithm for finding the backbone of both types of models is similar ( but not identical ) , we will use the same language to describe both models , and choose the language of lattice - gas models .",
    "this means , for example , that whenever we speak of `` vacancies '' it should be interpreted as `` sites with value 0 '' or `` low - density regions '' in the context of spin - facilitated models . for brevity",
    ", we will also use the term frozen particles interchangeably with permanently frozen particles .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional rectangle , represented by a square lattice , such that each site either contains one particle or is vacant .",
    "the rectangle has @xmath3 sites in the horizontal direction , and @xmath1 sites in the vertical direction , such that @xmath7 . in our numerical simulations we used hard - wall and periodic boundary conditions in both directions , but most of our analytical approximation ignores the boundary conditions . for rectangles of infinite length ,",
    "hard - wall boundary conditions simulate particles inside a two dimensional channel , and periodic boundaries simulate particles on the surface of a cylindrical tube .    for the lattice - gas model we use the kob - andersen ( ka ) model @xcite , such that a particle can move if it has at least two neighboring vacancies before and after the move . for the spin - facilitated model we use the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model @xcite , such that a site can change its state if it has at least two neighboring sites with a value of @xmath6 .",
    "we could have chosen a different number of neighbors needed for movement , but on the square lattice the only interesting effects occur at two neighbors .",
    "if only one neighbor is needed for movement then all the particles are movable as long as there is at least one vacancy in the fa model or two adjacent vacancies in the ka model . if three neighbors are needed for movement then any closed loop is frozen , even a @xmath8 block , which means that almost all the particles in the system are frozen .",
    "mathematically speaking , the ka model and the fa model are very similar to each other . also , a mobile particle in the ka model is necessarily mobile in the fa model , and a frozen particle in the fa model is necessarily frozen in the ka model , thus the fraction of frozen particles in the ka model is larger than ( or at least equal to ) the fraction of frozen particles in the fa model .",
    "toninelli , biroli and fisher showed @xcite that for an infinite system in the ka model , none of the particles are permanently frozen as long as the lattice is not completely full with particles , which automatically means that this is also the case in the fa model . in this paper",
    "we study how many particles , on average , are permanently frozen for a given particle density , @xmath9 , and given rectangle dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "numerical simulations done on square systems @xcite @xmath11 , in our notations@xmath12 showed that the fraction of permanently frozen particles , @xmath13 , rises rapidly from @xmath6 to @xmath5 at a certain critical density , @xmath14 , which increases with system size .",
    "holroyd  @xcite theoretically analyzed jamming in this context using the notion of _ critical droplets _",
    ", which are small unjammed regions which facilitate movement throughout the system .",
    "he showed that for very large squares in the fa model the relation between the critical density and the system size is @xmath15 toninelli et .",
    "al . showed @xcite that this value of @xmath16 is also true for squares in the ka model .",
    "however , this result is only true for asymptotically large @xmath3 .",
    "we can define an effective @xmath16 @xmath17\\ln l , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which converges to @xmath16 as the system size increases . for systems of size @xmath18 it was found @xcite that @xmath19 for all simulated sizes .",
    "this contradiction was resolved by holroyd s proof @xcite that the convergence of @xmath20 to @xmath16 is very slow and may be apparent only at systems of size @xmath21 , beyond the capabilities of modern computers , and beyond the range of physical realization ( @xmath22 implies a system of @xmath23 particles ) .",
    "holroyd s analysis considered only the size of the system , and not its shape . for long rectangular domains , this method may not be used .",
    "instead , we find that rectangular systems may be divided into independent _ sections _ , in the sense that jamming in one section does not depend on the internal configuration within its neighboring sections . within each section ,",
    "holroyd s notion of critical droplets may be used .      in this paper",
    "we show how not only the size of a system influences jamming in it , but also its shape .",
    "we demonstrate this , first by considering the limit of very large systems .",
    "when considering a square system of size @xmath24 , and taking the limit @xmath25 , one finds that the critical vacancy density , @xmath26 , scales as @xmath27 .",
    "we find that when the system s width @xmath1 is fixed and the length is taken to infinity @xmath28 , the critical density scales as @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "the second scenario we consider is of a system of fixed area , for which we change the aspect ratio between the width and the length of the system .",
    "we find that stretching the system causes it to jam , and relate this result to recent experiments of sheared granular matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secdiv ] of this paper",
    "we derive an approximate analytical expression for the fraction of frozen particles , @xmath13 , for a rectangular system of arbitrary dimensions @xmath10 . in section [ seclarge ]",
    "we deal with large systems , @xmath31 , and use our approximation to find the critical density at which the system goes from jammed to unjammed and the width of this transition .",
    "we find that the system can be considered infinite if its length is longer than the average section length , or equivalently @xmath32 . in section [ secsmall ]",
    "we deal with narrow systems ( small @xmath1 ) , and improve the approximation derived in section [ secdiv ] .",
    "we even derive an exact result for the case of very narrow systems ( @xmath28 and @xmath33 ) . in section [ secinter ]",
    "we investigate the internal structures in the system .",
    "the appendices contain the derivation of the lengthy expressions used in the analytical approximation .",
    "holroyd showed that in a large enough square there is a probability of approximately @xmath34 that a particle is part of a critical droplet , where @xmath16 is given in eq .",
    "( [ lambdadef]b ) .",
    "hence , the total number of critical droplets in a rectangle of size @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the vacancy density .",
    "the expression for the critical density in square systems , eq .",
    "( [ lambdadef]a ) , is derived by setting @xmath38 .",
    "such a critical droplet can cause the entire system to be unfrozen , thus the critical vacancy density is when the number of critical droplets is finite , since below ( above ) that critical density the number of critical droplets is very small ( large ) when @xmath3 is taken to infinity .",
    "the fraction of frozen particles in the fa and ka models is obviously different , due to the different kinetic constraints , but that difference is small .",
    "the reason that the densities of frozen particles for both the fa and the ka models are almost the same can be seen from the construction of holroyd s proof .",
    "holroyd considered small critical droplets , which are unfrozen , and checked how they can be expanded to `` unfreeze '' the entire system .",
    "the criterion for the expansion of these droplets is the same in both models , and the only difference is in what constitutes a small critical droplet .",
    "for example , the structure @xmath39 is unfrozen in the fa model but frozen in the ka model . for large enough systems , and evidently for small ones too , the effect of this difference is negligible .",
    "however , when @xmath40 and @xmath1 remains constant we can not simply set @xmath41 to find the critical density , since the solution to this equation is @xmath42 for all @xmath1 .",
    "our resolution of this problem is obtained by dividing the long rectangle into finite sections , implementing the idea of critical droplets in each section , and finally averaging over all sections .",
    "another approach , which yields the same results , is solving the equation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the average section length ( see below ) .",
    "a rectangular system may be divided into sections by noting that if there are two or more successive columns which are completely full , then all the particles in them are permanently frozen in both the ka and fa models and with either hard - wall or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we call a pattern of @xmath45 successive full columns a _ strip _ of size @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . a single full column",
    "is not called a strip .",
    "these strips divide the rectangle into finite _ sections _ , such that the leftmost column on each section is the first not - full column after a strip , and the rightmost column is the final column of the next strip .",
    "each section contains only one strip .",
    "for example , see fig .",
    "[ gridex2 ] .    , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the strips are columns @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . ]    using this division , we note that the particles within one section are independent from the particles in the other sections , i.e. , the state of the particle ( whether it is frozen or not ) depends only on the structure within its section , and not on the configuration of neighboring sections .",
    "each finite section of length @xmath52 ending with a strip of size @xmath45 and with @xmath53 occupied sites , has many configurations for the @xmath54 particles in the @xmath55 columns not occupied by the strip .",
    "we will denote these configurations with an index @xmath56 .",
    "since the probability of having a strip of length @xmath45 is independent of the probability for a certain configuration in the rest of the strip , the probability of such a configuration occurring is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the probability of having a strip of length @xmath45 containing @xmath59 particles , and @xmath60 is the relative probability of configuration @xmath56 in the region with @xmath55 columns and @xmath54 occupied sites between the strips , such that there are no two adjacent full columns .",
    "the reason we exclude the possibility of two adjacent full columns is to count each type of section only once , since two ( or more ) adjacent full columns divide the section into smaller sections .",
    "the average fraction of frozen particles , @xmath13 , is the number of frozen particles divided by the number of particles , @xmath61 } , \\label{npfmain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the total number of permanently frozen particles in the section , with @xmath63 being the number of frozen particles in the @xmath55 columns not occupied by the strip .",
    "the sum over @xmath55 and @xmath45 is such that @xmath64 , and @xmath45 is greater or equal to @xmath65 , except in the following special cases : no strip in the entire rectangle ( @xmath66 ) , and the entire section is full ( @xmath67 ) . since the probability @xmath68 appears both in the nominator and the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ npfmain ] ) we need not worry about its normalization or the normalization of @xmath69 . however , we find that in the limit of infinite length the probability is normalized such that @xmath70 .",
    "in our case , we assume that the probability that a particle in a section of length @xmath71 is frozen is the probability that it is frozen in a section of length @xmath55 times the probability that the added column does not contain critical droplets , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the average over all configurations .",

    "we further note that the ratio between the first part of the nominator and the denominator is the density of particles which are in the strips in both models and with both boundary condition .",
