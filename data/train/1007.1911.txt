    "using suitable bijections between dyck paths , binary trees and planar trees , the two mentioned catalan lattices can be defined on the set of plane trees of size @xmath4 in such a way that the dyck lattice with @xmath4 elements is an extension of the tamari lattice with @xmath4 elements ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider yet another occurrence of catalan structures , the so called _ series parallel interval orders_. our aim is to define the two above catalan lattices on the set of series parallel interval orders with the aid of a special kind of linear extension .",
    "we propose this unified interpretation since , in our opinion , it allows to better understand the connections between dyck and tamari lattices . to obtain our characterization of the dyck and tamari lattices",
    "we will make use of some basic notions of the theory of posets .",
    "the known relationship between the two lattices will be quite simple to achieve in our setting .",
    "thanks to this approach we will also be able to provide a link between the dyck ( respectively , tamari ) lattice and the strong ( respectively , weak ) bruhat order , when the latter is considered on the class of permutations avoiding the pattern 312 .",
    "as already recalled , the main combinatorial objects in this approach are series parallel interval orders , which are the intersection of two important classes of partially ordered sets , namely series parallel orders @xcite and interval orders @xcite .",
    "our approach will express important features of series parallel interval orders and so their use in this unified version of the two catalan lattices seems to be relevant in its own .",

    "this kind of posets has been recently considered in @xcite , where the authors show that they are enumerated by catalan numbers according to the number of their elements ; some bijections with other structures enumerated by catalan numbers are also established . for our purposes , we need to recall here a bijection @xmath12 ( stated in @xcite ) between planar trees with @xmath13 nodes and @xmath14 . given any planar tree @xmath15",
