    "living organisms face changing environmental conditions . parasites are a case in point : after each transmission event they find themselves in a new host that may be quite different from the previous one .",
    "for example , the immune system of the new host may respond differently to the parasite , and the new host may have a different genotype or even belong to a different species .",
    "thus , a parasite genotype that is characterized by a high fitness in one host may have a low fitness in a different host .",
    "the question therefore arises how parasites evolve under the fluctuating selective pressures imposed on them through transmission events to different hosts .",
    "most of the studies so far have focused on models for host - pathogen interactions in a deterministic context @xcite . in some applications",
    "however it is natural to assume that environment ( and hence fitness landscape ) switching is not deterministic . for example , a pathogen could switch to a different host .",
    "evolution of the pathogen then takes place in the new host ( or environment ) , where the pathogen genotypes face different selective pressures , hence the dynamics of the pathogen genotypes are different .",
    "we remark that the evolving organism need not be a pathogen , nor is the environment necessarily a `` host '' .",
    "evolution of organisms in deterministically and randomly varying environments has been studied by many authors , see @xcite for an early review .",
    "karlin and collaborators @xcite introduced both deterministic and stochastic models for the evolution of haploid and diploid organisms under changing selection intensities for fixed and varying population sizes . in case of a deterministic two - allele model",
    "they showed that the genotype with higher selection intensity goes to fixation and the time to fixation varies according to the selection intensities .",
    "furthermore , they investigated a stochastic model where generational selection intensities are identically distributed independent random variables .",
    "they focused on the question how the probabilities of fixation and the times to fixation change in the stochastic model . in @xcite ,",
    "et al . _",
    "considered a 4-dimensional system of difference equations for the haplotype frequencies of a two - locus model .",
    "typical two - locus models show either fixation in one or both loci or stable polymorphic cycles , with period equaling the period of the environmental changes , i.e.  the periodic fitness values .",
    "they however showed the existence of so called supercycles that have 1100 times the period of the periodically changing environment .",
    "the questions of structural stability , i.e.  sensitivity in terms of the fitness parameters and the size of the basin of attraction of these cycles were investigated .",
    "similarly , nagylaki @xcite investigated the existence of genetic polymorphisms for two - allele models with periodically varying fitness values .",
    "he showed that in a continuous differential equation model genetic polymorphism will persist with periods equaling the periods of the varying fitness values , however in a discrete model fixation is also possible .",
    "hybrid switching differential equations and more generally hybrid switching diffusions have found many applications in wireless communications , queuing networks , ecology @xcite and financial mathematics , to name but a few ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the word `` hybrid '' refers to the coexistence of continuous dynamics and discrete events , see also the related concept of piecewise deterministic processes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study a simplified version of the continuous time fisher - haldane - wright equation ( also known as _",
    "standard replicator equation _ , @xcite ) subject to fitnesses driven by a markov jump process .",
    "it is well known that in the deterministic fisher - haldane - wright model the pathogen genotype that has the highest fitness value will go to fixation .",
    "the coupling of different fisher - haldane - wright equations by a markov process however requires a new definition of the concept of `` highest fitness '' .",
    "hence we study the possible changes to the stability behaviors of the monomorphic equilibrium states depending on the stationary distribution of the switching markov process .",
    "first we establish analytical results for the stability / instability of equilibria in the hybrid model .",
    "we show that in the case of a state - independent switching process , the monomorphic equilibrium of the genotype with highest mean fitness is asymptotically stable in probability while the monomorphic equilibria of all other genotypes are unstable in probability .",
    "as the stationary distribution of the switching markov process varies , so does the mean fitness of each genotype .",
    "this results in exchanges of stability without the merger of the equilibria during the transition process .",
    "we may call this a `` stochastic transcritical bifurcation '' .",
    "finally , we present some numerical simulations to illustrate our result and also an example of a state - dependent switching process .",
    "we consider a model for @xmath0 genotypes of a pathogen evolving in @xmath1 possible environments .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the fitness value of genotype @xmath3 in environment @xmath4 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that for any fixed environment @xmath4 , the fitness values @xmath5 are all different . we write @xmath6 for the vector of all fitness values of genotype @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the frequency of pathogen @xmath3 , so that the dynamics in each environment takes place in the @xmath8-dimensional simplex @xmath9 we write @xmath10 for the state of the system at time @xmath11 .",
    "the frequency dynamics of pathogen genotype @xmath3 in environment @xmath4 is given by @xmath12 this equation is the fisher - haldane - wright equation for frequencies of genotypes of asexually proliferating organisms .",
    "the rate of growth or decay of a genotype is determined by the difference of its fitness and the average fitness of the population .",
    "observe that the simplex @xmath13 and any of its subsimplices are invariant under the dynamics given by equation .",
    "it can be shown by straightforward computation that the average fitness in environment @xmath4 @xmath14 satisfies @xmath15 with equality if and only if @xmath16 is an equilibrium .",
    "it follows from the global existence of solutions and lasalle s theorem that every trajectory of approaches one of the finitely many equilibria situated at the vertices of the simplex , see @xcite .",
    "the environment switches according to a continuous time stochastic process @xmath17 that takes values in the set @xmath18 .",
    "the switching process @xmath19 is a markov process with ( possibly state - dependent ) generator matrix @xmath20 whose entries @xmath21 are defined by @xmath22 the elements @xmath23 of the generator matrix @xmath24 satisfy @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 for every @xmath28 ( such a matrix is said to have the _ @xmath29-property _ , see @xcite ) .",
    "the complete hybrid switching ordinary differential equation can be cast in the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 determines the environment @xmath4 at time @xmath11 and @xmath32 are defined by .",
    "the right hand side of the differential equation in is globally lipschitz continuous on the compact set @xmath33 .",
    "this implies global existence and uniqueness of solutions in the sense of stochastic processes , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) .    for the equation restricted to a fixed environment @xmath4 , the vertices @xmath34 of the simplex @xmath13 ( i.e.  the unit vectors of @xmath35 ) are all the equilibrium solutions .",
    "it is easy to show that all but one of these equilibria are unstable and that the stable equilibrium in environment @xmath4 is the one for which the fitness value @xmath5 is the largest . in the following section",
    "we investigate how this result generalizes to the case that stochastic switching is introduced .",
    "for this of course , we need to first generalize the concept of stability to switching ordinary differential equations .",
    "in this section we establish results concerning the stability and instability of monomorphic steady states of the hybrid model .",

    "other competition models may lead to deterministic bistability or to periodic orbits ( for example the rock - paper - scissors game @xcite ) . secondly , although the host switching process is stochastic , we model within - host evolution in a deterministic way .",
    "a more realistic approach would incorporate random genetic drift into the model .",
    "this may be particularly important during transmission events , which often involve population bottlenecks due to small inoculum sizes .",
