    "we review recent work on cp violation in unpolarized @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "let us consider the process with unpolarized initial beams : @xmath2 the crucial point here is that for @xmath3 the charginos do not form a particle - antiparticle pair .",
    "hence , while the initial state is in the c.m .",
    "frame odd under charge conjugation , the final state has no such symmetry .",
    "this leads to the cp - violating effect we discuss here .",
    "under cp conjugation the @xmath4-matrix element @xmath5 of the process ( [ eq : original - process ] ) gets transformed into ( up to a phase which is irrelevant for us ) : @xmath6 which amounts to the following change in the cross section , or , better , the mass indices @xmath7 . ] : @xmath8 . due to poincar invariance",
    "the _ unpolarized _ cross section @xmath9 may depend only on the masses @xmath10 and on two independent scalar variables , say , on mandelstam s and which obviously do not change under c or p. hence , if one sticks to the unpolarized part only , the cp transformation can be reduced to final - state chargino mass interchange : @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , for equal - mass fermions in the final state ( @xmath12 ) the unpolarized cross section is always p- , c- and cp - even scattering , which is often referred to as parity violating , in fact only indicates the presence of a parity violating term in the interaction , the unpolarized cross - section itself being , of course , p - even . ] . in contrast , if the chargino species are different , cp - violating terms can arise even in the unpolarized cross - section . that is the effect we will consider ,",
    "so unless otherwise stated the final - state chargino masses are taken non - equal .",
    "the polarization - dependent cp - violating observables at one - loop order require more involved analysis and will not be discussed here .",
    "calculations show that the tree - level cross section ( polarized and unpolarized ) of the process ( [ eq : original - process ] ) is cp even @xcite , but cp - odd terms do arise in the one - loop contributions .",
    "therefore , a natural experimental observable to consider is the ratio @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cp - odd part of the corresponding cross - section : @xmath15 , \\quad d\\sigma_0^{\\rm cp } \\equiv d\\sigma_0 \\bigr|_{m_i \\leftrightarrow m_j } .",
    "\\label{eq : sigma_odd_def}\\ ] ]    as just mentioned , the cp violation first enters at one loop , thus , to estimate the effect one should calculate @xmath16 at the one - loop level . on the other hand , in most of the kinematical regions",
    "far from any resonance , one can expect ( see , e.g.@xcite ) that the tree level gives a reasonable approximation to @xmath9 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : obvservable - definition ] ) .",
    "so , we will deal only with the ratio @xmath17",
    "r0.5        in @xcite partial one - loop calculations were provided for the case of complex higgsino mass parameter @xmath18 .",
    "a limitation of that analysis was that it was performed in the heavy slepton limit , and furthermore , all one - loop triangle vertex corrections to ( [ eq : obvservable - loop / tree ] ) were dropped .",
    "the observed effect turned out to be of the order of a couple of percent , depending on the chosen mssm parameters and the kinematics .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this calculation was done just to make sure that the observable does not vanish , while its magnitude should be estimated from complete one - loop results .",
    "a full calculation has recently been performed  @xcite .",
    "the full result turns out to be of the same order as the box - only estimates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : full_vs_box ] the `` box - only '' and full one - loop values of the observable ( [ eq : obvservable - loop / tree ] ) are plotted as functions of the higgsino phase @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the other parameters are taken as : @xmath22 , the polar scattering angle @xmath23 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the su(2 ) gaugino mass parameter @xmath26 , the u(1 ) gaugino mass parameter ( taken to be real ) @xmath27 .",
    "the common susy breaking mass of the scalars ( for the full one - loop calculation ) is 1  tev .",
    "the qualitative agreement for the gauge box contribution alone can be ( at least , partially ) explained .",
    "indeed , a closer look at the expression for the @xmath28-boson exchange contribution ( eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) in @xcite gives the @xmath29-function part ) shows , that only the imaginary part of the box integral can affect the observable .",
    "since in the heavy slepton limit the position of the threshold singularity is high , the integral remains real in the kinematical region we consider .",
    "the selectron exchange box diagram provides a nice illustration : when we raise the c.m .",
    "energy above the selectron pair production threshold the selectron box diagram develops an absorptive part and its contribution to the asymmetry ( [ eq : obvservable - loop / tree ] ) is non - zero , see fig .",
    "[ fig : selectron box contribution ] ( the selectron mass is @xmath30  gev ) .",
    "similar statements can be made about most of the diagrams contributing to ( [ eq : obvservable - loop / tree ] ) at the one - loop order .",
    "[ fig : selectron box contribution ]    ) .",
    "the selectron mass is 403  gev.,title=\"fig : \" ] 0.4 cm ) .",
    "the selectron mass is 403  gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the above argument also indicates that in a scenario with lighter sparticles , other diagrams with vertex and self - energy corrections can not be neglected , as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown there that for the case of cp - violating origin in the top squark sector the box diagrams do not contribute and the cp asymmetry receives contributions only from vertex and self - energy diagrams .",
    "since charginos are not stable particles and decay finally to leptons / quarks and the lsp , in a realistic experiment one has to take into account also chargino decays . on the other hand",
    "we know that also in chargino decays it is possible to obtain cp - violating effects at one - loop level  @xcite",
    ". therefore one can worry if cp - violating effects in the decay would not cancel similar effects in the chargino production .",
    "however , a consideration similar to one presented in  @xcite helps here . as shown in that paper , at the one - loop level",
    "the observable ( [ eq : obvservable - loop / tree ] ) among other pieces contains the @xmath29-function integral .    to cancel such a contribution at any kinematical point",
    ", one needs a corresponding contribution from the final particle decay .",
    "so , the only way is the box diagram ( e.g.  the @xmath28-exchange box ",
    "see @xcite , fig .",
    "2 ) attached to one of the external legs . even if the mass splitting between charginos is larger than @xmath31 , the kinematic configuration of the box diagram in the decay is completely different from the one in the production , so the cancelation of different cp - odd contributions is in general not possible .",
    "this statement becomes trivial if the mass splitting is smaller than @xmath31 and no cp asymmetry arises in the decay due to double @xmath28 exchange diagram .",
    "moreover it is even possible to arrange parameters in such a way that no 2-body decay channels remain open for charginos and therefore no cp - odd contribution due to chargino decays enter in the full production+decay process , but still allowing for such contributions in the chargino production .",
    "therefore we conclude that in general cp - odd effects in the production process can not be canceled by cp - odd effects in the decays of charginos .",
    "we have demonstrated that the cp asymmetry built from unpolarized cross sections for non - diagonal chargino pairs in @xmath32 annihilation can arise at the one - loop order .",
