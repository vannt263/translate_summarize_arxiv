    "in open systems , the time symmetry of the evolution equations such as the schrdinger equation is spontaneously broken with the appearance of poincar resonance , and irreversible process emerges @xcite .",
    "time - symmetry breaking is ubiquitous in nature , _",
    "e.g. _ , nuclear decay and spontaneous emission @xcite , but at a glance it seems inconsistent with the principle of microscopic dynamics , which dictates the time evolution of a physical system to be time - reversible subject to unitary time evolution . therefore ,",
    "since the birth of quantum mechanics , finding a consistent interpretation for irreversible phenomena in a unified theoretical framework has been a fundamental difficulty @xcite .",
    "recently , various extensions of quantum mechanics written in terms of a phenomenological non - hermitian hamiltonian have been proposed@xcite ; for example , it has been revealed that if we weaken the standard requirement of hermiticity in favor of parity - time - symmetry ( pt - symmetry ) @xcite the effective hamiltonian may exhibit a _ bifurcation _ of the eigenvalues from real to complex , as the system control parameter surpasses a critical value .",
    "this singular critical point is mathematically identified as an exceptional point ( ep ) where the effective hamiltonian takes a jordan block structure as not only the eigenvalues but also the eigenstates coalesce@xcite .",
    "this process can be viewed as a phase transition in a dynamical sense : below the critical point , time - evolution is reversible , while irreversibility appears beyond the critical point .",
    "therefore we call this _ a time - symmetry breaking phase transition _ ( tsbpt ) where the imaginary part of the eigenvalue can be regarded as an order parameter that has a singularity at the critical point in terms of a system control parameter@xcite .",
    "very recently tsbpt has been experimentally observed in mesoscopic quantum systems@xcite , and also in many analogous optical systems where interesting collective dynamical properties have been studied , such as superradiance and lasing @xcite .    in the description of open quantum systems ,",
    "a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian can be derived from the microscopic total ( hermitian ) hamiltonian including the environment with use of the feshbach - projection - operator method ( fpo method ) without relying upon phenomenological equations @xcite , where detailed information about the microscopic interaction with the environment is renormalized into the self - energy , which is represented by a cauchy integral in which the direction of the analytic continuation across the branch cut determines the direction of the arrow of time .",
    "prigogine and one of the authors ( t.p . )",
    "_ et al . _",
    "have clarified that the spectrum of the effective hamiltonian coincides with that of the total hamiltonian , so that the hermitian hamiltonian of the total system can have a complex spectrum due to the resonance if we extend the eigenvector space from the ordinary hilbert space into a dual vector space , called the extended hilbert space , where the hilbert norm of the eigenvector vanishes@xcite .",
    "an important feature of the effective hamiltonian thus derived is that it may have strong energy dependence , especially around the branch point . as a result ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem of the effective hamiltonian is nonlinear in the sense that the operator itself depends on the energy eigenvalue .",
    "this nonlinearity plays a crucial role in the tsbpt , because the self - energy changes dramatically around the branch point bifurcation .",
    "however , the role of this nonlinearity in the study of tsbpt has not been fully discovered yet . as an example demonstrating the importance of the nonlinear effect , in our previous study on the decay process of an impurity in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) conduction band we showed that the van - hove singularity in the density of states results in a strong non - analytic enhancement of the decay rate@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a microscopic model consisting of multiple discrete states coupled with a common 1d continuum , in which the nonlinearity plays an essential role in the properties of the tsbpt . as a result of the coupling of several resonance states through a common continuum ,",
    "the individual decay processes interfere with each other yielding a characteristic spectral profile known as a feshbach - fano resonance@xcite . as a result of the interference",
    ", the decay process may be completely suppressed for certain parameter values , which is also known as a bound state in continuum ( bic)@xcite . here we show that when the discrete state energies are located near the branch point , the stabilization by the fano resonance and the destabilization by the van hove singularity compete to introduce entirely new dynamics .",
    "though several works have investigated the tsbpt associated with multi - level systems coupling with a common continuum @xcite , the nonlinear effect has been examined in less detail . in this work ,",
    "we reveal that the usual _ second - order _ phase transition becomes _ fourth - order _ when two resonant states appear near the continuum threshold , by carefully considering the nonlinear effect of the microscopic effective hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we find that the decaying state is more strongly stabilized due to this competition than the stabilization resulting from an ordinary fano resonance .    in section  [ sec : model ] , we present our model and the nonlinear eigenvalue problem of the effective hamiltonian by use of the fpo method . before studying the decay process for two discrete states , in section  [ sec : single ] the nonanalytical enhancement of the decay process due to the van hove singularity is briefly reviewed for a single state model .",
    "the main results of this paper for the two discrete states model are presented in section  [ sec : double ] , where it is revealed that the order of the tsbpt is significantly modified as a result of the competition between the van hove singularity and the fano resonance .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to clarifying the role of the van hove singularity by comparing these results to the decay process for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) system ; we also propose some experiments to observe our findings . in appendix",

    "there is another way to represent the effective hamiltonian that is useful to describe the situation when @xmath40 .",

    "in this section , we study a single discrete state coupled with the continuum to show that the time - symmetry breaking bifurcation is a second - order phase transition resulting from the nonlinearity in the eigenvalue problem of the effective hamiltonian .",

    "the first - order derivative of @xmath73 in terms of @xmath3 is discontinuous at the bifurcation point@xcite as shown in fig.[fig : evsingle ] : in this sense , we can think of the time - symmetry breaking transition as a second - order phase transition .",
    "note also that the decay rate is proportional to @xmath74 which is non - analytically enhanced by the van hove singularity , compared to the ordinary decay rate determined by fermi s golden rule : @xmath75 for @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "we have shown so far that the two eigenvalues coalesce at the bifurcation point . in eq.([singlezpm ] ) , the eigenvalues are described by a fractional power expansion around @xmath60 , indicating that this bifurcation point is an ep , which is a singularity of a characteristic equation of a linear operator , at which the eigenstates coalesce and the operator can be no longer diagonalized @xcite . at the ep , the operator can only be reduced to jordan block form . even though our effective hamiltonian is a scalar operator , we present in appendix [ appsec : jordan ] an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian represented by two - by - two matrix which becomes a jordan block matrix at the bifurcation point .",

    "similar to the 1d system , the time - symmetry breaking transition occurs as a fourth - order phase transition .",
    "however , the range of this smooth transition is very narrow compared to the 1d system , as seen in fig.[fig : epfano_3d](b ) .",
    "this illustrates that the van hove singularity in the 1d system enhances the higher - order phase transition .",
    "the drastic change in the higher order tsbpt due to the cooperation of the ep and the fano resonance at the continuum threshold shown in fig.[fig : epfano ] can be experimentally observed in the autoionization decay of an atom or a molecule with use of time - resolved ultrafast spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "here we propose an experiment which uses a combination of time - resolved x - ray absorption ( trxas ) @xcite and time - resolved photoelectron spectroscopies ( trpes ) @xcite , as shown in fig.[fig : trxas ] , which should capture this characteristic phase transition .",
    "in trxas , an ultrashort x - ray pulse excites a core electron to the discrete states near the ionized threshold , such as rydberg states , and rabi oscillation is induced between the resonance states by the pulsed excitation , which is observed by a delayed absorption probe .",
    "the frequency of the rabi oscillation corresponds to the difference in the real parts of the complex eigenvalues , and the damping rate of the rabi oscillation reflects the decay rate due to the autoionization of the excited electron into the continuum . in trpes , the autoionized photoelectron is detected by a time - resolved detector . since trpes directly detects the decay product of the photoelectron , it reflects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues much more clearly than the damped rabi oscillation by trxas .",
    "for example , the oscillatory behavior of trpes corresponding to the rabi oscillation is drastically terminated at the fano resonance because one of the decay channels is completely suppressed .",
    "therefore when we measure both trxas and trpes and compare them , we can get a full picture of the decay process including the tsbpt .",

    "the eigenvalues are obtained as the solutions of the dispersion equation @xmath167 yielding the eigenvalues as @xmath168 which are the same as eq.([singlezpm ] ) .",
    "it is obvious from eq.([app : barh ] ) that @xmath166 is undiagonalizable at the ep for @xmath169 because it takes a jordan block structure .        which gives the same eigenvalues as eq.([z_as_expnds ] ) .",
