    "the amplitude profile , the discrete frequencies and the quantization conditions of spin - wave eigenmodes in stripes @xcite , rectangles @xcite , disks and ellipses @xcite are now well understood and allow nowadays even for an engineering of the spin - wave eigenmode spectrum in such a small magnetic structure taking into account issues of geometric shape , multilayer stacks , and even magnetic domain structure .",
    "the magnetization dynamics of rings magnetized in the onion state shows a large richness in its eigenmode system .",
    "quantization of spin waves takes place not only due to the confinement in radial and azimuthal direction in the so - called equatorial regions at and ( see inset in fig.[fig_1 ] for the definition of the angular positions ) but also in spin - wave wells in the so - called pole regions at and created by the inhomogeneity of the total internal field @xcite .",
    "the spatial profiles of these eigenmodes have been widely discussed in the last years by several research groups @xcite and it is well known , that low - frequency spin waves are located at the poles of the onion state whereas in the equatorial regions confined spin waves with higher frequencies are present with nodes either in azimuthal or radial direction , depending on the excitation .    in the real world modes are not true eigenmodes in a sense , that they are not totally decoupled from the environment and from each other .",
    "they are weakly coupled to the environment , i.e. to the lattice , and thus they are weakly lossy .",
    "so far the problem of dissipation has been rarely addressed . in @xcite",
    "the issue of finite coherence length of spin waves in a ring structure is discussed . for a deeper understanding it is of central interest to study the mode dynamics ,",
    "in particular how fast a mode is relaxing after resonant excitation with a short microwave pulse and to identify the channels of dissipation . since the coupling is weak and",
    "can be discussed in a perturbation picture , we address the mode spectrum in the following as the `` quasi - eigenmode '' spectrum .",
    "here we report on the investigation of the lifetime of quantized spin waves in a small magnetic ring structure magnetized in the so - called onion state using time - resolved brillouin light scattering microscopy . for this purpose ,",
    "permalloy ( ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 ) rings with an outer diameter of , a ring width of @xmath2 nm , and a thickness of were prepared by a combination of molecular beam epitaxy in an uhv system and electron beam lithography , utilizing a lift - off technique .",
    "the ring structures are placed on top of a coplanar waveguide as shown schematically in fig.[fig_1 ] .",
    "the waveguide is made out of a 200 nm au layer and the central strip line has a width of , small enough to ensure high excitation fields in the region where the ring structures are placed .",
    "the ring to ring spacing was chosen twice the ring diameter to avoid magneto - static and dynamic coupling between neighbouring rings .",
    "the geometry of the dynamic and static magnetic fields used in these experiments is illustrated in fig.[fig_1 ] : a static magnetic field h@xmath3 of is applied along the direction of the central strip line to induce the onion state of the magnetization . in this case",
    "the magnetization is aligned mainly parallel to the axis of the central strip line of the coplanar waveguide and , therefore , the efficiency of the excitation with the dynamic magnetic field h@xmath4 is optimal .",
    "( color online ) the magnetic ring structures with a thickness of , an outer diameter of and a ring width of are placed on top of a coplanar waveguide made out of au with a central strip line width of and thickness of .",

    "the inset shows a micromagnetic simulation of the so called onion state of the magnetization . for the particular geometry and applied field transverse domain walls",
    "are present at and leading to a strong reduction of the total internal field . in both regions , the poles at and , and the equator at and ,",
    "the coupling of the dynamic magnetic field h@xmath6 caused by a microwave current flowing through the coplanar waveguide is most efficient . ]    in order to determine the quasi - eigenmode frequencies in the pole and equatorial regions of the onion state we performed fmr - bls measurements at and .",
    "a microwave current with frequencies between 2ghz and 8ghz was sent through the coplanar waveguide to excite the magnetization .",
    "the precession amplitude is measured locally by means of bls microscopy with a spatial resolution of .",
    "a detailed explanation of this technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig_2 ] where the bls intensity is plotted as a function of the applied microwave frequency for the pole position at ( red , dotted line ) and the equator position at ( blue , solid line ) .",
    "two very strong resonances can be observed at : and .",
    "two weaker resonances and with their origin in the pole region , as dicussed in the text below , contribute to the bls intensity measured at .",

    "( color online ) spin - wave amplitudes measured with bls microscopy under the application of a dynamic magnetic field in the plane of the sample caused by a microwave current flowing through the central conductor of the coplanar waveguide .",
    "the spectra were acquired in the pole region at , red dotted line , and in the equatorial region at , blue solid line .",
    "five resonances are found , three ( , , ) located at the pole and two ( , ) at the equator . ]    for a better understanding of the nature of all the observed resonances we performed bls measurements as a function of the azimuthal angle while exciting the magnetization with the resonance frequencies shown in fig.[fig_2 ] .",
    "the spatial distributions of the low frequency spin - wave modes @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are displayed in fig.[fig_3 ] where the bls intensity is plotted as a function of the azimuthal angle .",
    "all three modes @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , observed in fig.[fig_2 ] , are strongly confined in the poles of the onion state , as expected from previous works @xcite .",
    "the modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 with higher frequencies are located in the equatorial region at and as can be seen in fig.[fig_4 ] .",
    "the quasi - eigenmode shows one maximum and the quasi - eigenmode shows three maxima in each half of the ring .",
    "the fact that higher azimuthal quasi - eigenmodes in rings and disks have lower frequencies due to their backward volume mode character is well known and was reported previously @xcite .",

    "the spin - wave amplitudes under excitation with the frequencies @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 of the quasi - eigenmodes found in fig.[fig_2 ] are plotted as a function of the position . for clarity",
    "the spectra are vertically shifted against each other .",

    "the quasi - eigenmode with the highest frequency ( blue solid line ) has its maximum amplitude at .",
    "the next quasi - eigenmode at the equator shows two nodes in azimuthal direction . ]    after the determination of the spin - wave frequencies , which can be resonantly excited with an in - plane magnetic microwave field , and the positions of maximum spin - wave amplitudes , the investigation of the temporal evolution of the observed quasi - eigenmodes has been addressed .",
    "therefore , the sample is now excited with microwave pulses with a duration of and a repetition period of .",
    "the rising edge of the pulse starts a counter with a time resolution of . from this time on , the arrival time of each inelastically scattered photon is acquired together with its frequency  similar to the experiment described in @xcite .",
    "the full spectral , spatial and temporal information of the investigated spin wave modes is now accessible .",
    "figure  [ fig_5 ] shows the temporal profile of the spin - wave quasi - eigenmodes @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in the pole region of the onion state .",
    "the time in which the microwave pulse is applied is indicated in the bottom of the figure .",
    "the spin - wave intensities increase drastically within the first few nanoseconds when the pulse arrives and starts to decay when the pulse terminates .",
    "the intensities of all three measurements are normalized to the intensity at the time when the excitation pulse terminates in order to emphasize the difference in the relaxation part of the temporal profile .",
    "a multiplication with a constant factor does not change the slope of an exponential decay in a logarithmic plot but it supports the comparison of the decay of the different spin - wave quasi - eigenmodes .",
    "it can be seen in the time window between the two vertical dashed lines in fig.[fig_5 ] that the decay constant @xmath12 , if one assumes an exponential decay @xmath13 , differs for each frequency .",
    "the higher the spin - wave frequency is the faster is the relaxation , i.e. the smaller is the decay constant @xmath12 .",
    "the same qualitative behaviour is observed for the spin waves in the equatorial region , see fig.[fig_6 ] .",
    "the first azimuthal mode with the higher frequency shows a faster relaxation than the third azimuthal mode with lower frequency .",

    "the upper curve ( red ) displays the lowest frequency mode and the lowest curve ( blue ) corresponds to the quasi - eigenmode .",
    "the intensity of all temporal profiles is normalized at the time where the excitation pulse terminates . in between the vertical , dashed lines an exponential decay of the quasi - eigenmode amplitudes",
    "can be observed with different decay constants for each mode . ]",

    "the lower curve ( blue ) displays the behavior of the quasi - eigenmode , the upper curve ( red ) corresponds to the quasi - eigenmode .",
    "the intensity is normalized at the time where the excitation pulse terminates .",
    "the decay constant @xmath12 is determined in the time window defined by the vertical , dashed lines . ]",
    "( color online ) decay constants @xmath12 for all investigated quasi - eigenmodes as a function of the excitation frequency . in the left part of the figure @xmath12 is plotted for the low frequency spin waves confined in the pole region of the onion state .",
    "the right part shows @xmath12 of the spin waves at the equatorial region .",
    "the decay constant is extracted out of the temporal profiles in figs.[fig_5 ] and [ fig_6 ] in the time windows indicated by the dashed vertical lines where the influence of the microwave pulse is negligible . ]",
    "the decay constants for all investigated spin - wave quasi - eigenmodes are summarized in fig.[fig_7 ] .",
    "here it is evident that the decay constant is decreasing with increasing frequency for the same type of spin waves , but there is a general difference when the character of the spin - wave quasi - eigenmode , i.e. the wavevector and the quantization condition , is changed .",
    "we find - despite the fact that the frequencies of the spin waves are much higher in the equatorial region - that the relaxation times are comparable to the relaxation times at the poles of the onion state .",
    "several mechanisms contribute to the dissipation of spin - wave quasi - eigenmodes , for example coupling to the lattice , i.e. magnon - phonon - scattering , and coupling within the spin - wave quasi - eigenmode system , i.e. magnon - magnon - scattering .",
    "the first mechanism depends on the magneto - elastic constants of the used material and is , therefore , independent of the lateral position on the ring .",
    "the efficiency of energy transfer in the latter mechanism strongly depends on the total internal field , the magnetization distribution within the quantization volume and , since energy conservation has to be fulfilled in the magnon - magnon - scattering process , on the frequencies of the participating spin waves . hence , a position dependency of the dissipation processes , as we observe it in the ring structure , is obvious and can explain that the decay constants @xmath12 are nearly the same at the equator as in the poles - even if the frequencies of the measured spin waves are much higher .",
    "independent measurements show evidence for a direct coupling of spin wave modes excited near the poles of the ring with spin waves confined to the equatorial region via three - magnon - scattering .",
    "this is evidenced by a resonance in the coupling , i.e. maximum in the decay constant , when the frequency ratio between modes in the equatorial and pole regions is 2:1 fulfilling energy conservation for three magnon scattering .",
    "in conclusion we have determined the decay constants of all spin wave modes that can be excited with in - plane microwave pulses in a small magnetic ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 ring using time - resolved bls microscopy .",
    "low frequency excitations were observed in the poles of the onion state whereas the spin waves detected at the equatorial position have higher frequencies and were identified as the well - known azimuthal modes of the onion state .",
    "the decay constants were extracted from the temporal evolution of the spin wave amplitudes after the end of the exciting microwave pulse .",
    "a decrease of the decay constant , i.e. a shorter lifetime of the spin - wave quasi - eigenmodes , was found when the frequency of the quasi - eigenmode is higher .",
    "the comparison of the dissipation time of the quasi - eigenmodes confined at the pole and the equatorial region of the onion state is indicating that different dissipation mechanisms are responsible for the relaxation of the magnetization , depending on the position and the quantization conditions of the spin - wave quasi - eigenmodes .",
