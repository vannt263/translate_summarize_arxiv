    "in electrodynamics , the integral equation method ( iem ) is a powerful method for the electromagnetic wave propagation @xcite . from a microscopic perspective",
    ", a bulk material can be regarded as a collection of molecules ( or atoms ) , each of which is a scatter and emits radiation under the action of an external field .",
    "the radiated retarded field and the exciting field interact to form the resultant transmitted field in the material .",
    "this formulation is often expressed as an integral equation and naturally leads to the well known ewald - oseen extinction theorem which is a basis of the scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the iem relates the macroscopic electromagnetic responses of the material with the microscopic features of its constituent units , thus gives much deeper physical insight into the interaction of wave with material in contrast to the conventional approach of maxwell theory @xcite . at the same time , the iem does not require boundary conditions and is advantageous in some situations , especially when it is not sufficient to describe the interaction by the macroscopic maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "this approach has been widely used to study light scattering @xcite , the tip - sample interaction in near optics @xcite and so on . by now , the interactions of waves with semi - infinite @xcite , a slab @xcite or stratified @xcite isotropic dielectric media have been treated by the iem .",
    "recently , one kind of artificial anisotropic dielectric - magnetic materials , metamaterials , has attracted considerable attention simulated by its fascinating properties @xcite . to understand the unique characteristics of metamaterials it is necessary and appealing to take a microscopic viewpoint . on this issue",
    ", the iem has been successfully implemented to predict the electric and magnetic resonances in split - ring resonators @xcite , study the reflection of split - ring resonators @xcite and the imaging process of super lens @xcite , and explain the brewster phenomenon for te wave associated with metamaterials @xcite .",
    "however , most previous work only consider the situation of semi - infinite materials and waves incident from vacuum .",
    "then , how to treat the propagation of waves through stratified materials , especially for incidence from a material rather than vacuum ?",
    "the latter problem is important because it will result in a completely new form of the extinction theorem , as shown in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use the iem to investigate the properties of wave propagation in stratified anisotropic dielectric - magnetic media .",
    "our emphasis is to disclose the underlying physics of electromagnetic interaction with matter rather that to obtain the well - known phenomenal results .",
    "on the basis of the superposition principle , we use hertz vector formulations of radiated fields to study the microscopic mechanism of propagation .",
    "we arrive at new derivations of the dispersion relation , snell s law and reflection / transmission coefficients by self - consistent analyses .",
    "moreover , we find two generalized forms of the extinction theorem . as an application",
    ", we use the iem to study the wave propagation through a slab and discuss the physical process of photon tunneling , which are further verified through numerical simulations .",
    "the results lead to a unified framework of the iem for the propagation of wave incident either from a medium or vacuum in stratified dielectric - magnetic materials .",
    "in this section we take the microscopic viewpoint in which the matter consists of molecules that react to the exciting field like dipoles and formulate the radiated field in the form of a green s function integral of hertz vectors .",

    "so , we assume the dipole moment densities @xmath17 and @xmath18 have the following forms @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the forward wave and @xmath25 stands for the backward wave @xcite .",
    "the wave numbers are to be decided by the dispersion relation yet to be derived .",
    "the green function is @xmath26 . to evaluate the hertz vectors ,",
    "we firstly represent the green function in the fourier form .",
    "then , substituting it into eqs .",
    "( [ pi_e ] ) and ( [ pi_m ] ) and using the delta function definition and contour integration method @xcite , the hertz vectors of the @xmath9-th layer can be evaluated as      right to the material      left to the material      where we have used the following notations @xmath30 note that the term with @xmath31 equals zero if @xmath32 contains @xmath33 , which can be found in the calculation .",
