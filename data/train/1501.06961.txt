    "the emergence of a macroscopic classical behavior from a microscopic quantum world can be explained in terms of decoherence to the environment that quickly destroys the coherent superpositions of macroscopic objects ( schrdinger cats )  @xcite .",
    "the selected pointer states must then be factorized states with respect to a tensor product structure that is local in real space  @xcite .",
    "similarly , superselection induced by decoherence due to weak interactions with the environment plays a key role also in the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking , where different ordered sectors with broken symmetry are dynamically disconnected and are thus the only states that are metastable  @xcite , whence the notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .    in the paradigmatic case of the quantum ising model , the ground space of the ferromagnetic phase at zero transverse field @xmath2",
    "is spanned by two orthogonal product states @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are in the same class of pointer states of the typical decoherence argument , while the symmetric states @xmath5 realize macroscopic coherent superpositions that are not stable under decoherence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at zero transverse field @xmath2 , the situation is very clear : the only stable states are those that maximally break the symmetry of the hamiltonian , and at the same time , those that feature vanishing macroscopic total correlations , including entanglement , between spatially separated regions .    , @xmath6 , and the remainder @xmath7 , so that the total hilbert space acquires the tensor product structure @xmath8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is the distance between the two regions @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the distance defining the new effective support after an adiabatic deformation of operators with initial support on @xmath12.,width=264 ]    as we turn on the external field @xmath2 , we have a whole range of values where , before a critical value @xmath13 is reached , there is a magnetic order associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite , and the decoherence argument applies within the entire ordered phase .",
    "this means that , again , the only stable states are those that maximally break the hamiltonian symmetry  @xcite",
    ". however , now the symmetry - breaking states are entangled , and their mixed - state reductions on arbitrary subsystems possess in general nonvanishing entanglement  @xcite , as well as quantum  @xcite and classical correlations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the symmetry - breaking ground states can be , `` locally '' , more entangled than some nearby symmetric states  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is always implicitly assumed that such states are not _ macroscopically _ correlated , while their symmetric superpositions are , in complete analogy with the case @xmath14 .",
    "although this is a very plausible picture , a rigorous proof has never been provided , due to the mathematical difficulties in dealing with measures of entanglement and correlations based on the von neumann entropy ; see , e.g. , the difficulties in proving the boundary ( _ area _ ) law in generic gapped systems  @xcite , or in proving the stability of topological entanglement entropy in topologically ordered states@xcite .",
    "the symmetry - breaking states obey the boundary law for entanglement  @xcite , while the macroscopic correlations featured by the superposition of two different symmetry broken sectors are of order one .",
    "the question is then about which quantity one should look at in order to distinguish the presence of macroscopic correlations , among all possible source of entanglement and correlations ?",
    "historically , the key concepts that have been considered are the off diagonal long range order ( odlro )  @xcite and , more recently , the two - site concurrence ( entanglement of formation ) at large distance  @xcite .",
    "if there is either odlro or nonvanishing concurrence between two sites in different clusters @xmath15 and @xmath6 , then also the two clusters must be entangled , since the total state of the global system is pure .",
    "this is an important point , because the reduced subsystems being in a separable state does not imply that there must be no entanglement between the two clusters in a pure state . even if all the remaining correlations are classical , they are due to the fact that the overall state is a pure entangled state .    on the other hand , the reverse argument needs not apply : it is possible that macroscopic clusters are entangled even if measures of two - point correlations , like the concurrence , are vanishing .",
    "for example , this can happen in the 2d toric code  @xcite or in the one dimensional cluster models  @xcite where all two - site concurrences are identically zero and yet the macroscopic block entanglement entropy is finite .",
    "also states that possess volume law for the bipartite entanglement typically have no two - site entanglement , because of monogamy",
    ". moreover , concurrence and odlro have to be computed for every specific model and can not provide universal classifications .    in the present work , we will show that macroscopic correlations are generally nonvanishing in generic symmetric states , and vanishing in symmetry - breaking states . to this end",
    ", we consider the total correlations ( classical plus quantum ) between two generic subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath6 of the total system , as measured by the mutual information  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the von neumann entropy of the density matrix pertaining to subsystem @xmath18 , as shown pictorially in fig .  [ system ] .",
    "the mutual information is indeed a",
    "_ bona fide _ measure of total correlations ( classical plus quantum )  @xcite .",
    "if for two arbitrary subsystems @xmath10 spatially separated by arbitrarily large distances @xmath9 the mutual information @xmath19 is vanishing , we are assured that there are no macroscopic correlations and , in particular , no macroscopic entanglement and no macroscopic quantum correlations ( all correlation and entanglement measures are non - negative defined ) . otherwise , taking into account that the total system is in a global pure state , the two subsystems must be macroscopically entangled and quantum correlated .",
    "it is immediate to verify that @xmath19 vanishes on symmetry - breaking states that are product states of the form @xmath3 and @xmath4 , while for symmetric superpositions @xmath20 it is always of order one , irrespective of the actual value of the distance @xmath9 .",
    "we will show that the above result is in fact valid in general . in order to prove such statement , our strategy is the following . starting from a factorization point ,",
    "i.e. a point in which the system admits a fully separable pointer state as global ground state  @xcite , we will consider adiabatic deformations of the ground state and we will study the behavior of the macroscopic mutual information .",
    "the deformation corresponds to the adiabatic continuation of the ground state obtained by switching on the transverse magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "we will prove that , in the entire symmetry - breaking phase , the total macroscopic correlations and , _ a fortiori _ , the macroscopic entanglement , as measured by the mutual information , vanish in the maximally symmetry - breaking ground states at large spatial separations between arbitrarily selected macroscopic subsystems . on the other hand , we will also prove that , as long as the deformation is sufficiently small , the macroscopic mutual information remains finite in symmetric states .",
    "later on , we will apply the results of the general analysis to specific spin models , showing that the result holding for slightly deformed symmetric states is in fact valid for all symmetric states in the entire symmetry - breaking ( ordered ) phase , until a quantum phase transition point is reached .    proving the general result",
    "analytically would be quite a daunting task if one were to consider the von neumann entropy @xmath21 .",
    "rather , we will resort to a related quantity , the @xmath0rnyi entropy , @xmath22 , and the corresponding @xmath0rnyi mutual information . for specific , computable , examples",
    ", we will then show that the general conclusions reached using the @xmath0rnyi entropy hold as well using the von neumann entropy .",
    "the rnyi entropies of index @xmath23 are defined as @xmath24 and they are all _ bona fide _ entanglement monotones  @xcite . in particular , the @xmath0rnyi entropy @xmath22 is an experimentally accessible quantity , since it is the expectation value of the swap operator on two copies of a quantum state  @xcite , while the von neumann entropy @xmath21 is not an experimentally friendly observable , because it requires complete state tomography , which is essentially impossible on a many - body state . concrete proposals for measuring @xmath22 resort on quantum switches  @xcite , or on multiparticle interferometry  @xcite .",
    "we thus consider the @xmath0rnyi mutual information defined as @xmath25 unlike the quantum mutual information defined in eq .",
    "( [ def1 ] ) , the @xmath0rnyi mutual information may not be positive defined for every state in hilbert space . in order to ensure positivity",
    ", one can regularize this definition in terms of @xmath0rnyi relative entropies , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , on the class of states of interest for the present investigation , non - regularized @xmath0rnyi mutual information is always positive definite . moreover , as already mentioned , in the paradigmatic case of the exactly solvable one - dimensional quantum @xmath1 model , we will also make direct comparison with the von neumann - based mutual information , finding complete agreement .",
    "finally , the clustering property and other general properties of the @xmath0rnyi mutual information that are at the core of our investigation and that we will prove below , can be proven without too much effort to hold valid also for the regularized versions .",
    "therefore , in the following , also in order to avoid unnecessary formal mathematical complications , we will consider only the non - regularized version of the @xmath0rnyi mutual information .    by adopting such strategy , we will obtain the following main result : in the ordered phase corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of some symmetry of a many - body hamiltonian with nonvanishing local order parameter , the mutual information between two arbitrarily selected subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath6 separated by a distance @xmath9 reaches its maximum in the symmetry - preserving ground states and is upper bounded by @xmath26 in the maximally symmetry - breaking ground states , i.e. the ground states that maximize the order parameter .",
    "therefore , we establish rigorously that - at least for some finite range of values within the phase - spontaneous symmetry breaking corresponds to the suppression of macroscopic coherent superpositions , and symmetry - breaking ground states are the ones selected in real world by environmental decoherence , in complete analogy with pointer states . in the following ,",
    "we specialize to the class of global @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "in particular , we will consider the specific , but paradigmatic , example of the of quantum @xmath1 models , and we will show that macroscopic entanglement survives until a quantum phase transition occurs .",
    "however , the central elements of this result hold in general and the remaining ones can be easily adapted to every instance of spontaneous symmetry breaking for different hamiltonians and different classes of symmetry groups .",
    "macroscopic long - range total correlations are revealed by a nonvanishing mutual information @xmath28 between two arbitrary regions @xmath15 and @xmath6 separated by arbitrarily large distances . if @xmath28 vanishes",
    "when @xmath15 and @xmath6 are separated by a distance larger than what defines the macroscopic interaction scale , then we are assured that there is no macroscopic entanglement .",
    "let us first consider the case of fully factorized ground states .",
    "these states are realized at a precise and unique set of values of the hamiltonian parameters in an ordered phase , the so - called factorization point or , in spin systems , the factorizing field , first discovered in ref .",
    "the general theory of ground - state factorization in terms of the response to local unitary perturbations was fully developed much later , in refs .",
    "factorized ground states can only occur in an ordered phase of strongly interacting many - body systems .",
    "indeed , they are always maximally symmetry - breaking ground states with degeneracy equal to the dimension of the symmetry group and , being fully product states , they have a trivially vanishing mutual information @xmath28 .",
    "remarkably , at the factorization point , all other ground states can always be expressed as coherent linear superpositions of the fully factorized and maximally symmetry - breaking ground states  @xcite .",
    "then , by construction , symmetric ground states feature a nonvanishing @xmath28 , no matter how large the distance @xmath9 between the @xmath15 and @xmath6 regions .",
    "moreover , there are no further types of entanglement and quantum correlations involved .",
    "therefore , the classicality of symmetry - breaking states is immediately verified at the factorization point .",
    "as the hamiltonian parameters are changed adiabatically and move away from the factorization point , ground - state entanglement does not come solely from the macroscopic superposition of disconnected sectors , but also from the fact that fully factorized states are no longer ground states .",
    "they can be represented as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unitary operator that connects the instantaneous ground states of the hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "the operator @xmath30 is an entangling operator , showing that the symmetry breaking ground states are now entangled .",
    "this raises the problem whether they are still only locally entangled or if they have developed some macroscopic entanglement .",
    "similarly , for the symmetric states will be @xmath32 , it is not immediately obvious to what extent their entanglement is macroscopic or not for a generic value of @xmath33 . in the following , we show that the entanglement and the correlations due to the adiabatic continuation @xmath30 are local , i.e. they vanish in the limit of arbitrarily large spatial separations @xmath9 .    in order to proceed , we need to discriminate clearly between the macroscopic and the local contributions to @xmath28 .",
    "we first recall that by @xmath34 we mean the quantity @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the purity defined as @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 is the reduced density matrix from the ground state of the total system to the subsystem contained in the finite region @xmath15 . to compute the rnyi entropy of order 2",
    "we will use the identity @xmath39 , where @xmath40 represents two copies of the original full state on the doubled hilbert space @xmath41 .",
    "the operator @xmath42 is the permutation operator ( swap operator ) of order two with support on @xmath43 only : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the permutation operator on the @xmath47-th spin of the system , i.e. @xmath48 .    next , we exploit a locality result , stemming essentially from the lieb - robinson bound  @xcite . indeed , for the mutual information based on the von neumann entropy , a recent seminal contribution has shown that @xmath49 is an upper bound for the two - point correlation functions and a lower bound to exponentially decreasing functions of the ratio between the @xmath9 and the correlation length  @xcite .",
    "following hastings and wen  @xcite , let us consider a many - body hamiltonian sum of local terms , @xmath50 with a finite gap @xmath51 above the low energy sector for some finite interval of values of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath33 ( then , out of this interval a quantum phase transition may occur ) .",
    "moreover , the local operators are assumed to be bounded : @xmath52 .",
    "if the ground state of @xmath31 is known for a particular , fixed set of values of the hamiltonian parameters , say @xmath53 , we may obtain it for any other generic set @xmath33 by the quasi - adiabatic continuation @xmath30 induced by a continuous deformation of @xmath31 . a local operator @xmath54 with support on @xmath15 transforms as @xmath55 . the new operator @xmath56 has support on the whole hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , the locality result implies that we can arbitrarily approximate it with an operator @xmath57 that has support only over the hilbert space associated to a region with diameter , as long as @xmath11 is larger than the correlation length @xmath58 induced by the gap @xmath51 , and by this making an error bounded in this way : @xmath59 .",
    "the constant @xmath60 grows like @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the spatial dimension ( e.g. the lattice dimension for localized spins ) .",

    "assume first that the initial state at @xmath64 is one of the completely factorized ground states ( which , we recall , are also maximally symmetry - breaking ground states ) . in this case ,",

    "let us next consider the opposite case in which the ground state for @xmath64 is a macroscopic coherent superposition ( schrdinger cat ) of the fully factorized ground states .",
    "we show that any such superposition leads to a non vanishing @xmath79 .",
    "since we need to consider two copies of the ground state , we will label the factorized states by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , on each copy .",
    "so , we can write @xmath82 and similarly for @xmath81 . therefore , @xmath83 . for the sake of an explicit evaluation , consider the case of a doubly degenerate ground state manifold and subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath6 with equal size ( number of spins ) . for symmetric superpositions",
    "we then obtain : @xmath84 since for @xmath85 the expectation values of @xmath86 are positive definite , by continuity they are still positive for a small enough value of @xmath33 .",
    "so we see that , for small @xmath33 , the second term in eq .",
    "[ mainresult ] , is negative but that the @xmath87 stays strictly positive , for arbitrary @xmath9 .",
    "this is also true for any non trivial superposition of the symmetry breaking sectors given by the amplitudes @xmath88 , so that only the maximally symmetric breaking ones have exactly zero @xmath87 ( as @xmath89 ) .    in the following ,",
    "we determine the exact value of @xmath87 for macroscopic coherent superpositions with arbitrarily large @xmath9 in the entire ordered phase , beyond the perturbative case of small @xmath33 in the case in which @xmath15 and @xmath6 are made by a single spin . we prove this result explicitly for models with @xmath27 symmetry , but the central elements of the proof are valid for arbitrary symmetry groups and arbitrary dimension of @xmath15 and @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , our proof implies that for a maximally symmetry broken ground state all the correlations function between two very far subsystems factorize in the product of the expectation value of the local operators . and",
    "this implies that the mutual information between @xmath15 and @xmath6 must vanish .",
    "when we turn to consider symmetric ground states , some of these local expectation values must vanish because the local operator does not commute with at least one of the parity operators that define the symmetry group of the hamiltonian . as result the mutual information is expected to be different from zero .",
    "a comprehensive analysis on the dependence on the size of the subsystems and/or the symmetry group of the hamiltonian is in progress  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we focus on spin-@xmath90 systems with a global @xmath27 symmetry , thus described by hamiltonians that commute with the parity operator along a fixed spin direction , i.e. . in such systems",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is associated to the presence of a two - fold degenerate ground state and an off diagonal long - range order along a spin direction @xmath91 that is orthogonal to @xmath92 .",
    "we show that throughout the entire ordered phase the long - range mutual information vanishes identically on states that maximally break the symmetry , while it remains strictly positive on any macroscopic coherent superposition of the two broken symmetry sectors . for the sake of simplicity we focus on the case in which subsystems @xmath15 and @xmath6 are each one made by a single spin but the results can be extended straightforwardly to more general choices .",
    "the two orthogonal symmetric ground states @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( respectively , the even - symmetric and the odd - symmetric ground states ) form a convenient basis that allows to write all other ground states @xmath95 in the ordered phase as their linear superpositions : @xmath96 .",

    "@xcite , all correlation functions can be associated to spin operators that either commute or anti - commute with the parity operator @xmath104 .",

    "this fact is easy to prove when considering symmetry - breaking states that are completely unentangled ( fully factorized ) , whose symmetric superpositions are ghz states . in order to prove this feature in",
    "the entire ordered phase , a much more challenging task , we followed a strategy based on two ingredients : ( i ) adopting measures of mutual information based on the @xmath0rnyi and on the von neumann entropies , and ( ii ) exploiting locality results about quasi adiabatic continuation of quantum states derived by using the lieb - robinson bounds  @xcite . in this way we were able to prove that spontaneous symmetry breaking selects the many - body states with vanishing long - distance mutual information , and thus macroscopically least entangled , and therefore most classical .    in perspective",
    ", we are concerned with the investigation of several open problems . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to extend our analysis to the case of subsystems of arbitrarily variable size , in order to observe possible threshold effects , and to generic classes of symmetry groups  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we are interested in studying the case of globally mixed states  @xcite and , in particular , equilibrium thermal states of models featuring spontaneous symmetry breaking below a critical temperature . at thermal equilibrium",
    "the system will be described by the gibbs state , where with @xmath47 we have explicitly labeled different sectors . below a critical temperature @xmath175 ,",
    "if @xmath47 labels the sectors with broken symmetry , spontaneous symmetry breaking means that in every single realization the label @xmath47 will be fixed by the initial conditions .",
    "therefore , our statement is that gibbs states obtained by fixing @xmath47 feature the least long - range mutual information compared to all other non - maximally symmetry - breaking gibbs states  @xcite .    from a different perspective , we remark that many - body localization has recently become a subject of great interest for the condensed matter community .",
    "systems with strong disorder featuring many - body localization fail to thermalize and to obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis  @xcite , because their eigenstates are more weakly entangled than in typical non - integrable systems",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the techniques developed in the present work might help in providing rigorous results regarding the clustering of mutual information in such systems .",
    "in fact , our techniques can be used to investigate also systems that involve long - range entanglement and correlations , such as topologically ordered states  @xcite and their resilience in the presence of perturbations or at finite temperature  @xcite .    _",
