    "a better understanding of the local and global mechanisms of turbulent transport of heat and momentum across a fluid layer that is heated from below and cooled from above remains a central subject of numerical , theoretical and experimental studies in the field of turbulent convection @xcite .",
    "this setup which is known as the classical rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) case is one ingredient of numerous astro- and geophysical turbulent flows as well as technological applications .",
    "a more precise quantification of global turbulent transport would immediately improve predictions on structure formation and dynamics .",
    "the key to deeper insights lies in the boundary layers of the temperature and velocity fields at the top and bottom plates  understanding their transformations with an increase of the temperature difference that is quantified by the rayleigh number @xmath6 .",
    "these boundary layers form a bottleneck that limits the transport in fully turbulent convection .",
    "the bottleneck is widened when the boundary layers start to fluctuate locally and to become eventually fully turbulent .",
    "the range of such a transition to boundary layer turbulence would , however , depend strongly on the prandtl number @xmath7 of the convecting fluid which relates viscous to thermal diffusion @xcite . while the thicknesses of the both boundary layers are about the same for @xmath8 , they differ significantly in the limits of very small and very large prandtl number .",
    "their dynamics are then more loosely coupled since one of the layers is well embedded in the dissipation - dominated and spatially smooth sublayer of the other field . for liquid metal convection at @xmath9 the thermal boundary layer is much thicker than the viscous boundary layer , such that the latter is well embedded in the diffusive sublayer where temperature decreases to a good approximation linearly with respect to wall distance @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to disentangle their dynamics and to compare the statistics of the viscous boundary layer to standard turbulent wall - bounded flows without temperature differences .",
    "the limit of very low prandtl number convection is interesting for a further reason . in ref . @xcite it was shown recently that the highly diffusive temperature field and the resulting coarse plumes drive the fluid turbulence more vigorously than the more filamented plumes at larger prandtl and comparable rayleigh number .",
    "additional studies in @xcite found that the same holds for the boundary layer of the velocity field .",
    "the level of the local fluctuations and the turbulent drag are enhanced in line with a significantly increased global momentum transfer which is measured by the reynolds number @xmath10 . in this way",
    ", a low - prandtl - number convection flow at a given rayleigh number will obey a much more vigorous fluid turbulence than a convection flow in air or water and thus provide an appropriate setup to investigate the transitional character of the ( velocity ) boundary layer in detail .",
    "in the present work , we study the boundary layer dynamics by means of high - resolution direct numerical simulations ( dns ) which can access all details of the fluctuating turbulent fields in the rbc flow .",
    "the setup that is chosen agrees with one of the most common laboratory experiments : a closed cylindrical cell with an aspect ratio of one .",
    "compared to a cubical or rectangular cell , this setup sustains one statistically homogeneous coordinate in the system , the azimuthal one , and has thus the highest symmetry .",
    "the perspective that is taken here is to analyse our simulation data as for a viscous boundary layer in a pressure - driven channel flow with a uni - directional mean flow @xcite .",
    "the high - rayleigh - number convection in the closed cylindrical cell builds up a large - scale circulation ( lsc ) which changes its orientation in the course of the dynamical evolution @xcite . for a better comparison to a channel flow",
    ", streamwise and spanwise directions will be obtained in the convection case by a plane - by - plane rotation of the velocity field into the horizontal direction of the lsc .",
    "this symmetry transformation removes the torsion in the large - scale circulation .",
    "in low - prandtl - number convection this circulation roll turns out to perform a very coherent motion since it is driven by coarse thermal plumes .",
    "mean profiles of the streamwise velocity , the temperature and the reynolds stresses are analysed in inner wall units .",
    "therefore , we have to adapt definitions of the friction velocity and the friction temperature to the present setup .",
    "furthermore , the statistics of the wall - normal derivatives of the horizontal velocity components is compared to those of the channel flow .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is to better quantify the transitional character of the boundary layers in the rbc flow .",

    "one sees that the temperature is very diffuse .",
    "one also sees the overall large - scale direction of the flow , which changes with time from approximately 0.7 radians in the top plot to 6 radians in the bottom plot .",

    ", the wind , which is averaged over 6 - 30 free - fall times @xmath44 , takes the form of a single flow roll with a preferred orientation  a configuration that clearly breaks azimuthal symmetry .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] displays instantaneous snapshots of the streamlines of the two - dimensional skin friction vector field at the bottom plate for convection in mercury at @xmath46 ( left ) and @xmath47 ( right ) .",
    "the skin friction field can be considered as a blueprint of the near - wall viscous boundary layer dynamics and has been studied in wall - bounded shear flow @xcite as well as in rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite . at the bottom plate ( @xmath48 )",

    ", one can clearly divide the near  plate boundary layer into three main regions , the _ impact _ region where the cold lsc flow masses hit the bottom plate , the _ shear _ region where the lsc sweeps across the interior section of the plate , and the _ ejection _ region where the heated fluid rises up towards the cold top plate again .",
    "this separation into three distinct regions requires a sufficiently large rayleigh number .",
    "we will return to this point in section v when discussing the derivatives at the plates at @xmath48 and 1 .",
    "on the basis of the critical points of the skin friction field the inner region can be clearly distinguished from the impact and ejection regions . also visible is the broken azimuthal symmetry of the flow .",
    "we define two different area  time averages , one across the whole plate @xmath31 with @xmath54 which will be denoted by @xmath55 ( as already mentioned in section [ methods ] ) and one across an interior section of the plate which is indicated in figure [ fig2 ] for points with @xmath39 .",

    "the latter will be denoted as @xmath57 . as seen in figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the average with respect to the interior plate section excludes impact and ejection region and brings us closest to the conditions in a canonical boundary layer with a unidirectional mean flow , at least for the higher rayleigh number .",

    "we investigate this further in figure [ phivsz ] , where we show instantaneous profiles of @xmath60 for two different rayleigh numbers .",
    "one sees that the orientation angle twists as @xmath40 increases from the angle at @xmath61 , to eventually match the orientation angle at @xmath62 ( which is different from the angle at @xmath61 by about @xmath63 radians ) .",
    "if we focus on the right panel of figure [ phivsz ] , one sees that sometimes this twist is clockwise ( as for the first 15 snapshots ) , other times it is counterclockwise ( as for snapshots 30 - 60 ) and sometimes the twist changes direction ( as seen in snapshots 20 - 30 and the last three as well ) .",
    "of course , near the center of the container the horizontal velocity is significantly reduced compared to near the top and bottom plates , but we still see a steady twist in @xmath64 for most of the time , even in the center of the container . a similar behavior is seen for the left panel of figure [ phivsz ] , although the behavior occurs more rapidly in these @xmath44 time units .",

    "in contrast to a canonical boundary layer or a wall - bounded flow , a proper mean flow determination in rbc has to be adjusted to these permanently changing conditions .",

    "this planar rotation has brought the complex large scale flow closest to a standard boundary layer case .",

    "the structure of the boundary layers in a high - reynolds number turbulent rayleigh - bnard flow has been studied from the perspective of transitional wall - bounded flows , such as a channel flow .",
    "since the momentum transfer response ( and thus the large - scale reynolds number ) is very large in liquid metal convection flows at very low prandtl numbers compared to air or water , the viscous boundary layer fluctuates particularly strongly which is quantified by reynolds shear stress profiles and the statistics of derivatives at the walls .",

    "this is in contrast to a transient low - reynolds number channel which would approach a logarithmic scaling from above caused by the parabolic laminar flow profile at very small reynolds numbers .    when the sidewall effects are excluded , the temperature profiles come close to a power law scaling similar to chung et al . @xcite .",
    "although we could also fit a logarithmic law to the profiles , the slope differs significantly from what is expected for a turbulent boundary layer @xcite .",

    "the reynolds shear stress component @xmath147 , which is obtained at the same @xmath4 for runs rbc5 and cf , obeys qualitatively the same shape although the maxima are shifted by 10 wall units with respect to each other .",
    "together with the profiles which have been obtained for @xmath148 , this demonstrates that the transformation ( [ rot ] ) can identify a streamwise direction and thus effectively remove a significant part of the complex three - dimensional mean flow structure .    how can the structure of the boundary layer be described on average ?",
    "we go back to figure [ fig1 ] at the beginning and replot in figure [ fig14 ] the time - averaged slice cuts of temperature , skin friction magnitude and kinematic pressure taken at the same heights as in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the solid line in all three panels indicates the mean orientation of the flow in the vicinity of the plate .",
    "it is obtained again by averaging over the interior plate section .",
    "the following picture arises :    * the plume impact region at the bottom plate is on average colder than the rest of the plate region .",
    "temperature increases along the mean streamwise direction .",
    "the hotter plate region is where the lsc rises up towards the top plate  the plume ejection region . *",
    "the skin friction field magnitude shows the biggest spatial variability in the impact and ejection regions .",
    "this is also where most of the critical points , @xmath138 , are observed . as shown in figure",
    "[ critical ] , the majority of these points are found outside the interior plate section .",
    "the skin friction magnitude is largest in the interior section where the lsc sweeps across the plates and generates strong shear . *",
    "the interior plate section is well approximated by a favorable pressure gradient boundary layer .",
    "a local pressure maximum is clearly associated with the plume impact .",
    "pressure increases again slightly further downstream at the opposite edge of the interior region .",
    "this might be connected with the increase of temperature in the vicinity of the side wall . * with increasing rayleigh number",
    ", it is found that the wall stress ( or skin friction ) field components fluctuate increasingly stronger which also underlines the increasingly transitional character of the viscous boundary layer .",
    "this is a general and coarse - grained picture which is mostly related to the viscous boundary layer dynamics .",
    "our dns record allows to extrapolate the existing data in order to predict when a friction reynolds number @xmath149 is obtained that results in a turbulent channel flow as discussed in the landmark paper by kim , moin and moser @xcite .",
    "our present low-@xmath7 data suggest turbulence inside the viscous boundary layer for @xmath5",
    ". this value would be consistent with the experiments by glazier et al . @xcite that went up to rayleigh numbers of @xmath150 . however , their cell for the highest @xmath6 had an aspect ratio @xmath151 which reduces the downstream evolution length @xmath152 at a given rayleigh number ( see table [ tabpran ] ) and thus the scale over which the boundary layer can become turbulent .",
    "as a next step , it would be interesting to study the near - wall structure formation to more detail .",
    "these investigations are already in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "another interesting direction is to lower the prandtl number even further , e.g. to values @xmath153 which are typical for liquid sodium @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations at larger rayleigh numbers in sodium at @xmath154 are also currently underway and will be discussed in the near future .",
