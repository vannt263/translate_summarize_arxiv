    "however , the proof of the bch theorem does not give directly an explicit description of @xmath2 as a lie element ; moreover , such description is not unique in view of the jacobi identity .",
    "the most famous explicit expression of @xmath5 , in terms of nested commutators , is probably the one due to e. dynkin ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the reader may also consult @xcite for a list of explicit and recursive formulas .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a simple and elementary combinatorial description of the polynomial @xmath2 that uses some notions about planar rooted trees .",
    "the necessary combinatorial background is summarized in sections [ sec.subroot ] and [ sec.posetted ] . in particular , for every finite planar rooted tree @xmath15 , the set of its leaves admits a total ordering ( from left to right ) and also a partial ordering @xmath16 , which takes care of the position of leaves with respect to the subroots .",
    "then , we define a posetted tree as a finite planar rooted tree , whose leaves are labelled by elements on a partially ordered set ( a poset ) , monotonically with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "our main result ( theorem  [ thm.bchtrees ] ) gives an explicit description of every @xmath2 as a linear combination with rational coefficients of nested commutators , indexed by a certain set of posetted trees with @xmath3 leaves .",
    "the formula of the coefficients involves the bernoulli numbers and is completely described in terms of the combinatorial data of posetted trees .",

    "in view of the associativity relation @xmath183 we obtain that is a consequence of @xmath184 .",
    "choose @xmath185 and @xmath186 in equation , and @xmath187 and @xmath188 in equation . comparing the coefficient of the product @xmath189 in both equations , we obtain the following relations @xmath190 indeed , the coefficient of @xmath189 in equation comes from the bernoulli tree @xmath191 and so it is exactly @xmath139 . on the other side ,",
    "we need to consider the subset @xmath192 of trees @xmath193 with only one subroot , @xmath3 leaves labelled @xmath124 and one leaf labelled @xmath123 . for any @xmath194 , we have @xmath195 , and we can define @xmath196 as @xmath197 comparing the coefficients , we have @xmath198 next , let us compute @xmath196 recursively .",
    "there are two different types of contributions to @xmath196 due to the following graphs .",
    "the first contribution is due to the graph with only one subroot ; in this case , the coefficient is @xmath199)=-\\dfrac{b_n}{n } ad(b)^{n}(a).$ ] the other contribution is due to the graphs obtained from a graph in @xmath200 , for every @xmath201 , and grafting , at the leaves labelled with @xmath123 , a graph of @xmath202 .",

    "more precisely , let @xmath208 be any sequence in @xmath71 , and for any @xmath209 , define @xmath210 and the product @xmath211      one implication is clear , if @xmath214 , then @xmath215 this implies that the product @xmath212 is associative ( in the last equality we use that @xmath216 ) .",
    "as regards the other implication , assume that the product @xmath212 is associative ; then , equation holds for the product @xmath212 instead of @xmath4 . arguing as in the above remark , we conclude that the numbers @xmath208 must satisfy equation  , and this easily implies that @xmath217 , for every @xmath105 .",
