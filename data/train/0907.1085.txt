    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is an imaging and spectroscopy survey which mapped quarter of the sky near the north galactic cap .",
    "the data have proven extremely useful for the understanding of the milky way halo .",
    "in addition to a large list of mw satellites @xcite several extended stellar sub - structures in the mw halo have been found in the sdss data , such as the tidal tail of the palomar 5 globular cluster @xcite , the monoceros ring @xcite , two northern tidal arms of the disrupting sagittarius galaxy @xcite , the so called `` orphan '' stream @xcite , the aquila overdensity @xcite and the very long thin stellar stream called @xcite .",
    "streams are presumed to be remnants of tidally disrupted satellite galaxies and clusters .",
    "they provide important insights into the history of accretion events and the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "the tidal debris from disrupted satellites ( clusters ) spreads out in orbital phase on a path that is close to the orbit of the progenitor .",
    "streams tracing out orbits therefore provide opportunities to constrain the milky way s gravitational potential .    after initial searches for tidal tails of globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it was the extended sagittarius tidal tail that first made deriving such constraints practical ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the tidal tail of the sagittarius galaxy is quite wide and contains a considerable mixture of different stellar orbits , making it complex to model . for constraining the gravitational potential , a stellar stream that is very thin but of large angular extent , is ideal , because it permits precise orbital models .",
    "the first studies of globular cluster tidal debris only revealed short ( @xmath9 1@xmath10 ) signs of tails , but in recent years with the advent of large photometric surveys such as sdss and 2mass and significant advances in the techniques used to find streams , significant progress has been made .",
    "the matched filter technique @xcite has revealed the beautiful tidal stream of palomar  5 .",
    "detailed analysis of the pal  5 stream , including kinematics @xcite , have shown the promise of this approach , but also revealed that data over more than 10@xmath10 on the sky are needed to place good constraints on the potential .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite were successful in the detection of very long stellar streams using this technique , including the 63@xmath10 long stellar stream .",
    "besides the stream length and the approximate distance , most of the properties of were unknown .",
    "since the stream is long but relatively thin , with no apparent progenitor remnant , it was suggested that it arose from a globular cluster . in this paper",
    "we make an attempt to determine all possible properties of the stream including distance , position on the sky , proper motion , and radial velocity and try to constrain the milky way potential using that information .",
    "this work goes in parallel with the work done by  @xcite , but we are able to get a full 6-d phase space map of the stream and are able to use that map to provide significant constraints on the mw potential .",
    "see also  @xcite for theoretical discussion of using thin streams in order to constrain the mw potential .",
    "in performing this study we have obtained the first 6-d phase - space map for a kinematically cold stellar stream in the milky way .",
    "we view our present analysis in same sense as a pilot study for the gaia @xcite age , when this esa space mission will deliver dramatically better data on streams such as gd-1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : stellarpop ] we discuss the analysis of the sdss photometry , which entails mapping the stream in 3-d as well as determining its stellar population properties . in section  [ sec : kinematics ]",
    "we present the kinematics , with proper motions from sdss - usnob1.0 and line - of - sight velocities from sdss and calar alto . in section  [ sec : modeling_all ] we combine this information in an iterative step that involves improved stream membership probabilities , which in turn affects the estimates of proper motions and distances .",
    "this procedure results in the most comprehensive 6-d data set for a stellar stream in our milky way . in section  [ sec : orbitfitting ] we model the stream data by a simple orbit in a simple parametrized gravitational potential .",
    "we measure the potential circular velocity and find that the overall milky way potential at the stream position is somewhat flattened , but that much of that flattening can be attributed to the disk .",
    "the probability that a star is a member of the stream depends on its 6-d position and its metallicity . in the space of photometric observables , this means that it depends on @xmath11 , magnitude and color . in practice",
    ", the determination of the stream s angular position , distance and metallicity ( presuming it is old ) is an iterative process which we detail here . @xcite",
    "made the initial map of the stream using a matched color - magnitude filter based on the cmd of m13 observed in the same filters .",
    "not presuming a particular metallicity ( e.g. that of m13 ) , we start our analysis with a simple color - magnitude box selection for stars ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . the resulting distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_map_rotated ] . that particular color - magnitude box was selected as appropriate to find metal - poor main sequence ( ms ) stars at a distance of @xmath14 10  kpc , and",
    "indeed the stream is marginally discernible in the figure . with just a color - magnitude box",
    ", however , the detection fidelity of that stream is noticeably lower than that achieved by @xcite(their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the distribution of stars on figure  [ fig : sdss_map_rotated ] is plotted in a rotated spherical coordinate system ( @xmath15 ) , approximately aligned with the stream , where @xmath16 is longitude and @xmath17 is the latitude .",
    "the north pole of that coordinate system is located at @xmath18=34@xmath10.5987 , @xmath19 = 29@xmath10.7331 , the zero - point for @xmath16 is located at @xmath20 , and we will use this coordinate system for convenience throughout the paper to describe stream positions ( the transformation matrix from ( @xmath21 ) to ( @xmath22 ) is given in the appendix ) .    if we integrate the low - contrast 2d map in fig .",

    "but we can construct such a profile for any other ( e.g. ) color magnitude box and that profile can then be fitted by @xmath34 , where cmd refers to a given color - magnitude bin , and where we assume that both center ( @xmath35 ) and width ( @xmath36 ) of the stream are fixed at 0 and 12 arcminutes .",

    "the location of the ms turn - off can not be clearly identified , although there may be a hint at @xmath40 , @xmath41 . on figure",
    "[ fig : ugriz_cmds ] we also overplot the @xcite isochrones with age@xmath42  gyrs , @xmath43 at 8.5  kpc , which seem to match quite well .",
    "@xcite recently showed that the location of ms stars in the @xmath44 color - color plane is a good metallicity diagnostic .",

    "this argues for a population of single or a dominant metallicity and we can convert this color location to a metallicity using eq .  4 from  @xcite : @xmath45}_{phot}=-1.9\\pm 0.1 $ ] .",
    "this provides a metallicity estimate that is directly linked to sdss spectral metallicity estimate .        to derive the metallicity , age , and distance of stream stars in a systematic way",

    "we focus on fits to the color - magnitude diagrams in @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 filters , since that the @xmath49 color of the ms turn - off is a good metallicity indicator @xcite .",
    "we create the synthetic hess diagrams for a grid of model stellar populations @xcite with different ages ( @xmath50  gyr ) , metallicities ( @xmath51 ) , distances ( @xmath52  kpc ) , and a chabrier imf@xcite .",
    "we then explore that grid by computing log - likelihood of the distribution of stars in color - magnitude space .",

    "the filled circle indicates the best fit model : age@xmath42  gyrs , @xmath43 and distance@xmath53  kpc .",

    "[ fig : ugriz_cmds ] shows that the isochrones are reproducing the observed hess diagrams well , and hence further in the paper we will use t@xmath42  gyrs , @xmath43 as the baseline model for the stream s stellar population .",

    "[ fig : cmd_fit ] represents the averaged distance along the stream from @xmath54 . in section  [ sec : modeling_all ] we will present estimates of the distance to different parts of the stream .",
    "it is noticeable that the metallicity derived from the cmd fitting is higher than from the estimate based on empirical calibration of @xcite(see above ) and higher than the measurement based on the sdss spectra given by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is understandable given the known inaccuracies of the isochrones in the sdss photometric system @xcite .",
    "in particular the figure  19 of @xcite paper clearly shows a mismatch between fiducial isochrone derived for the m92 globular cluster ( which is used elsewhere as a good approximation of old metal - poor stars in the halo ) and the theoretical isochrones .    splitting the cmd data into @xmath16 bins",
    "shows that there is a distance gradient along the stream : figure  [ fig : cmd_split ] shows two hess diagrams obtained for two different pieces of the stream , on the left @xmath55 , and on the right  -@xmath56 .",

    "the analysis is based on proper motions derived from combining usno - b1.0 @xcite with sdss data @xcite , which we take from sdss dr7@xcite .",

    "the 6-d phase - space map of the stream , spanning more than @xmath270 on the sky , provided the opportunity not only to fit the orbit as @xcite and @xcite have done previously but to explore what constraints can be placed on the mw potential .",
    "the analysis is based on the assumption that the stream stars occupy one orbit . in detail , of course , different stars on the stream have slightly different values of conserved quantities and therefore lie on slightly different orbits . effectively , our analysis depends on these being small when compared with an orbital uncertainties .",
    "the magnitude of the departure of the stream from a single orbit will , in detail , be a function of the projenitor and the distruption process ; as these details became understood the model can be refined .",
    "we found that the distribution of stream stars in phase space can be well fit by an inclined eccentric orbit in the spheroidal logarithmic potential .",
    "after marginalization over the stream orbital parameters we derive a circular velocity @xmath259  km / s and flattening @xmath260 .",
    "this measurement has been made without the use of any information other than that in the stream itself .",
    "it is important that the information available in the observations of the stream is very sensitive to the @xmath285 , the circular velocity at the sun s position .",
    "the reason for that is that the stream extends more then 60@xmath10 on the sky and therefore both the radial velocities and the proper motions have components coming from the projection of the sun s motion .",
    "if we combine our circular velocity measurement with existing prior on the @xmath4 from @xcite and also marginalize over the distance from the sun to the galactic center using the @xcite prior ( @xmath264  kpc ) , we further tighten the error bar on @xmath286  km / s and on the flattening of the potential @xmath3 .",
    "our measurement of the @xmath4 is the best constraint to date on the circular velocity at the sun s position , and the measurement of @xmath6 is the only strong constraint on @xmath6 at galactocentric radii near @xmath287  kpc .",
    "the measurement of the flattening of the potential @xmath3 describes only the flattening of the overall galaxy potential at the stream s position @xmath268  kpc where the disk contribution to the potential is presumably large . unfortunately the data on the stream combined with the @xcite , @xcite priors on @xmath4 and @xmath281 are not enough for separating the flattening of the halo from the flattening of the total galaxy potential .",
    "so we are unable to place strong constraints on flattening of the mw dm halo ; we put a 90% confidence lower limit at @xmath8 .    despite the negative result on the measurement of the mw dm halo flattening",
    ", we note that the data from the stream is able to give strong constraints on two important galaxy parameters .",
    "we claim that that our dataset on the stream should now be combined in order to tighten the existing constraints on the galaxy parameters .",
    "it is important that the constraints on galaxy potential based on the stream dataset are , to large extent , model - independent and purely kinematic i.e. the constraints on the @xmath285 come to large extent from the projection effects and manifest themselves in proper motions and radial velocities .",
    "that makes it plausible why orbits of different eccentricities , and hence of different azimuthal velocities at their pericenter , can match so closely the same set of 6-d coordinates . since very cold streams take many orbits to spread a substantial fraction of 2@xmath288 in orbital phase ( see e.g. also pal 5 ; *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all future analyses of yet - to - be discovered streams will particularly need to consider the trade - off between the conceptual and practical attractiveness of cold streams and the near - inevitable limitations of their phase coverage .",
    "in addition to the weakness coming from phase coverage , our analysis at this point must rely on photometric distance estimates ; these have random errors of @xmath1410% , after an empirical distance correction to the best fit isochrones that is of the same magnitude ( see section  [ sec : stellarpop ] ) .",
    "while the proper motions that we derived for ensembles of stream stars are unprecedented for a stellar stream in the milky way s outer halo ; yet , the corresponding velocity precision , especially when compounded by distance errors , is still the largest single source of uncertainty in the fitting ( e.g. our tests have shown that overestimating heliocentric distances to the stream leads to the overestimated measurement of @xmath4 ) .",
    "we suggest that any attempt to fit the galactic potential(such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) now should not ignore the dataset on and should incorporate it into their fits .    the orbital parameters , which we have measured for the stream , are more or less consistent with those from @xcite : pericenter is at 14  kpc from the gc , the apocenter is at 26  kpc , the orbit inclination with respect to the galactic plane is @xmath255 .",
    "overall in this paper we have illustrated a method of analyzing the thin stellar stream using all the available information on it and further utilizing that to constrain the galaxy potential .",
