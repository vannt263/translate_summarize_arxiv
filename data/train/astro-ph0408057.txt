    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are a subset of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) that display episodic , dramatic x - ray and optical outbursts , which usually last for several months . in the interim",
    "the sxts are in a state of quiescence during which the optical emission is dominated by the luminosity of the faint companion star @xcite . in quiescence the optical lightcurves exhibit the classical double - humped ellipsoidal modulation , which is due to the differing aspects that the tidally distorted secondary star presents to the observer throughout its orbit ( e.g. see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the lmxb sxt prototype , a062000  ( = v616mon ) was discovered in 1975 by the ariel-5 satellite @xcite during an x - ray outburst whose peak flux made it the brightest nonsolar source ever seen .",
    "the optical counterpart was subsequently identified @xcite and after the system had faded back to its quiescent level , a062000  was found to be a 7.8hr binary system containing a k - type secondary star and a non - stellar continuum source attributed to an accretion disc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a radial velocity study led to the discovery of the first black hole primary in an x - ray transient @xcite .",
    "thereafter , many uv / optical / infrared studies of a062000  in quiescence have been undertaken ( @xcite ; @xcite ; shahbaz , naylor & charles 1994 ; mcclintock , horne & remillard 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; gelino , harrison & orosz 2001 ) , that have enabled the system parameters to be determined .",
    "the k3k4v secondary star has a radial velocity semi - amplitude of 433@xmath13@xmath3which gives a mass function of 2.72@xmath10.06@xmath4@xcite , the inclination is @xmath5=41@xmath13@xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the binary mass ratio @xmath7 is(@xmath8/@xmath9)=0.067 ( @xcite ; where @xmath9  and @xmath8  are the masses of the compact object and secondary star respectively ) and @xmath9=11@xmath11.9@xmath4(@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the high quiescent x - ray luminosity of a062000  compared to other black hole binaries indicates that it is not completely dormant @xcite , but that there is still some continuing accretion , although at a very low rate .",
    "superposed on the ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star are many rapid flares on timescales of tens of minutes or less ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which appear to be a common feature in quiescent black hole and neutron star x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "the results obtained from timing analyses alone have not proven conclusive and the origin of the variability still remains uncertain .",
    "the most likely explanations are magnetic reconnection events in the disc , optical emission from an advective region , reprocessed x - ray variability and flickering from the accretion stream impact point @xcite .",
    "a spectrophotometric study of the flares in v404cyg showed that the continuum and h@xmath0 emission line were at times correlated @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the h@xmath0 flare events suggest that the whole line profile participates in the flare , and can be explained if the optical flare is induced by variable photoionisation from the x - ray source .",
    "here we report on our time - resolved optical spectrophotometric study of a062000  in quiescence .",
    "we study the balmer line and continuum short - term variations and examine the spectrum of the variability .",
    "we infer the physical parameters and origin of the short - term flare .",
    "finally the low resolution spectra provides us with the kinematic resolution to study the emission line variations using the method of doppler tomography .",

    "time resolved spectroscopic observations of a062000  were obtained on jan 7 2003 using eso s very large telescope ( vlt ) unit telescope 1 equipped with the focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph fors1 .",
    "a log of the observations are given in table1 .",
    "the data were taken with the 600v grism with an order - sorting filter ( gc435 + 31 ) centred at 6270  and integration times of 120s . to maximise spectrophotometric accuracy",
    "a wide slit was used , and as a result the spectral resolution was determined by the seeing ( @xmath100.8for the entire night ) .",
    "we obtained 32 spectra with a slit width of 2.5and and 96 spectra with a slit width of 2.0 .",
    "the wavelength coverage and dispersion depends on the slit width , and we measured from the arc lines coverages and dispersions of 4933 - 7329at 1.17 per pixel for the 2.5slit and 4452 - 6794at 1.15 per pixel for the 2.0slit .",
    "the corresponding effective resolutions set by the seeing were about 4.7  and 4.6 for the 2.5and 2.0wide slits , respectively .",
    "although the atmospheric dispersion corrector was used , in order to minimise atmospheric dispersion along the slit when observations were taken at high airmass , the slit was aligned to a position angle of 131.7degrees east of north .",
    "the crowded field of view of a062000  is such that we were able to center a non - variable comparison star ( 38north 42west of a062000 ) on the slit for slit light - loss corrections . finally , since the observing conditions were excellent , the spectrophotometric flux standard hz2 @xcite was observed .",
    "the data were debiased and corrected for the pixel - to - pixel variations using the bias frames and tungsten lamp flat - fields respectively , taken as part of the daytime calibrations .",
    "the sky was subtracted by fitting second - order polynomials in the spatial direction to the sky regions on either side of the object .",
    "the spectra of a062000  and the comparison star were then optimally extracted @xcite with arc spectra extracted at the same location on the detector as the targets . the wavelength scale was determined through a fourth - order polynomial fit to more than 25 arc lines giving a root - mean square error of @xmath11  for all the spectra .",
    "some residual flexure is to be expected , and the additional use of a wide slit means that there is some uncertainty due to the position of the centre of light of the target .",
    "the latter term means that it is impossible to use the night sky lines to correct for this , so the comparison star s h@xmath0 absorption line was used .",
    "the relative velocity shift of each comparison star spectrum with respect to the first spectrum was computed using the method of cross - correlation .",
    "the velocity shifts were then applied to a062000  and the comparison star spectra .",
    "finally the velocity shift of the first comparison star , computed using the position of the h@xmath0 absorption line , was added to the a062000  velocities .",
    "we corrected the spectra for the instrumental response and determined the slit - losses to obtain absolute flux calibrated spectra .",
    "a third order polynomial fit to the continuum of the spectrophotometric standard was used to remove the large - scale variation of the instrumental response and the slit - loss corrections were calculated using the comparison star spectra .",
    "finally we use the colour excess of @xmath12=0.35@xmath10.02 @xcite and the extinction law of @xcite to correct the spectra of a062000  for interstellar reddening assuming @xmath13=3.1 .",
    "this is the starting point for the analysis of the spectra presented hereafter .",
    "spectrophotometric observations of a062000  were also obtained with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) on 2001 december 14 using the isis dual - beam spectrograph in single red arm mode to maximise throughput .",
    "the observations used the tek4 ccd and r158r grating yielding a dispersion of 2.9  per unbinned pixel .",
    "all observations were either unbinned or we used @xmath14 binning .",
    "the exposure time used was 120sec .",
    "a wide slit of 4arcsec rotated to include a comparison star ( which was not the same as the comparison star used at the vlt ) was used to ensure spectrophotometric accuracy , so the actual spectral resolution was set by the seeing . this was 1.92.4arcsec on the first night , 1.01.7arcsec on the second night , and about 1.0arcsec on the third night , corresponding to effective resolutions of 1520 , 814 , and about 8  respectively .",
    "a log of the observations are given in table1 .",
    "all images were debiased and flat - fielded using standard iraf techniques .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted of both a062000  and an on - slit comparison star using the optimal extraction method of @xcite .",
    "variations in transparency and wavelength dependent slit - losses were corrected by fitting a smooth function to the ratio of the individual comparison spectra to their average .",
    "wavelength calibration was done by interpolating from a series of cune+cuar arc spectra obtained at intervals of approximately an hour during each night . as the comparison star did not have strong enough absorption lines , further correction for flexure",
    "was not performed . since the velocity resolution is low anyway ( 350900kms@xmath15 ) we decided to discard the detailed velocity information and use the h@xmath0 emission in a062000  to calculate wavelength corrections , and simply work with integrated line fluxes .",
    "all three nights were non - photometric , so no attempt was made to apply absolute flux calibration and all fluxes are expressed relative units .",
    "simultaneous photometry was obtained with the site2 ccd camera on the jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) .",
    "an @xmath16 band filter was used with 60s exposures .",
    "standard iraf data reduction techniques were used to process the images , and differential photometry was performed using the optimal photometry algorithm of @xcite .    .",
    "[ fig : flarepos ]",
    "since the use of a wide slit adds uncertainty to the wavelength calibration , we only use the vlt to determine the radial velocity curve , as no appropriate correction could be performed for the wht data .",
    "we took the vlt data and used the cross correlation method of @xcite to determine radial velocities of absorption lines pertaining to the secondary star . prior to cross - correlation the spectra were interpolated onto a constant velocity scale ( 60 @xmath3pixel@xmath15 ) and normalised by fitting a spline function to the continuum .",
    "only regions of the spectrum devoid of emission lines ( 50005820  and 59006500 ) were used in the analysis .",
    "the balmer emission lines ( h@xmath2 and h@xmath0 ) , hei ( 5875 ) and interstellar naid lines were masked out so that they did not affect the cross - correlation process .",
    "we use the comparison star as a template , since its spectrum contains features of a late - type k - star . the resulting radial velocity curve",
    "was then fitted with a sinusoid with the orbital period fixed at @xmath17=0.323016d .",
    "we determine the radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath18 to be 403.0@xmath14.5@xmath3 , the systemic velocity @xmath19=10@xmath12@xmath3and the time at orbital phase 0.0 , @xmath20 to be 2452646.6365@xmath10.0005d ; phase 0.0 corresponds to the inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "the reduced @xmath21 of the fit was 2.7 and the uncertainties quoted are 1-@xmath22 and have been rescaled so that the reduced @xmath21 of the fit is 1 .",
    "it should be noted that since we used the position of the comparison star s h@xmath0 absorption line to determine the velocity zero point of the instrumental flexure , the radial velocities are relative to the comparison star .",
    "furthermore , given the uncertainties in wavelength calibration due to the large slit width , the value for @xmath19 should not be taken at face value . the radial velocity curve and sinusoidal",
    "fits are shown in figure[fig : rvcurve ] .",
    "the scatter in the radial velocity curve is caused by the uncertain wavelength calibration , due to the use of a wide slit .",
    "we also used a template star spectrum obtained by shifting all the spectra of a062000  into the rest frame of the secondary star , using the radial velocity solution derived by @xcite .",
    "the results obtained are the same as those obtained using the comparison star as a template .",
    "the amplitude we obtain for @xmath18 is less than that obtained by @xcite .",
    "this is because our coverage of the minimum in the radial velocity curve at phase 0.25 is not complete and so the derived value for @xmath18 is biased . by fitting the radial velocity curve with @xmath18 fixed at 432@xmath3 @xcite we obtain @xmath20=2452646.6361@xmath10.0005d .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath20 we obtain is different by 0.43 phase to that quoted by @xcite , even though the nominal definition of orbital phase 0.0 adopted is the same .",
    "this may have arisen from the potential ambiguity of defining phase 0.0 photometrically , as the minima at phase 0.0 and 0.5 can be almost the same depth and hence can be confused .",
    "no such ambiguity exists with our spectroscopic ephemerides .",
    "in figures[fig : vlt_lcurves ] and [ fig : bcurves ] we present the vlt continuum and emission line lightcurves as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the continuum lightcurve was obtained by summing the flux across the 50005820  and 59006500regions .",
    "the continuum lightcurve exhibits rapid short - term variations as seen previously by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . to determine the flare lightcurve we subtract a fit to the lower envelope of the lightcurve .",
    "we use an iterative rejection scheme to fit the lower envelope , similar to @xcite and @xcite . we reject points more than 2-@xmath23above the fit , then refit , repeating the procedure until no new points are rejected .",
    "most noticeable are the brief flares at orbital phase 1.15 and 1.2 which have a rise time of @xmath2415min and amplitudes of 3 and 12 percent respectively .",
    "a larger flare is also seen at phase 0.6 which has a rise time of @xmath2430min and an amplitude of @xmath2420 percent . in figure[fig : flarepos ] we have marked the beginning and end of the strongest most significant flare events and also the periods when flares are not seen .    to extract the balmer line fluxes ,",
    "the continuum background was removed by fitting and subtracting a smooth polynomial fit to the continuum regions around the lines before the line flux was integrated .",
    "the balmer line lightcurves show significant variations , scatters of 3.8 and 7.6 percent for the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 lightcurves respectively .",
    "the h@xmath2 and h@xmath0 lightcurves are strongly correlated .",
    "figure[fig : bcurves ] shows the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 emission line wings and core determined by integrating the line flux .",
    "the blue , core , and red wing fluxes were calculated by integrating the emission line over the velocity ranges 2500 to 500@xmath3 , -500 to 500@xmath3and 500 to 2000 @xmath3respectively .",
    "one can clearly see that the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 emission line wings and core are correlated with each other .",
    "the balmer line lightcurves show some correlations with the flare lightcurve ( figure[fig : vlt_lcurves ] ) .",
    "this is clearest for the flare event at phase 1.15 .",
    "there is no noticeable participation from h@xmath0 , although the correlation is quite strong in h@xmath2 .",
    "however , it could be that there is an underlying source of variable contamination in the h@xmath0 lightcurves such as from the disc ( see section[doppler ] ) , that prevents a complete correlation with the continuum lightcurve .",
    "the fractional variability in h@xmath2 is a factor of @xmath242 larger than in h@xmath0 ( see figure[fig : vlt_lcurves ] ) . in v404cyg",
    "the correlation between h@xmath0 and the continuum is much stronger .",
    "also in v404cyg the h@xmath0 emission line varies considerably @xcite by a factor of @xmath242 more than in a062000 .",
    "however , it could be that the optical depth in a062000  is larger than that in v404cyg , so the emission line flares are generally weaker , and h@xmath2 is more pronounced .",
    "also , the persistent lines could be stronger relative to the flaring component in a062000 .",
    "the h@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratio varies by 8 percent around a mean value of 2.7 , and is inversely correlated with the line fluxes , consistent with there being a higher optical depth in h@xmath0 than in h@xmath2 .",
    "the ratio h@xmath0/h@xmath2 is consistent with case b recombination ( 2.85 for t=10@xmath25k @xcite ) and so indicates that the balmer emission lines are optically thin . for the flare event at phase 1.15 the balmer decrement drops from 3.0 to 2.6 during the flare event indicating that either the flare arises from more optically thick regions or most likely that the temperature increases during the flare ( from @xmath245000k to @xmath2430,000 k ; @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of the line flare is larger than in the continuum by a factor of @xmath243 .",
    "one might expect that is because the continuum lightcurve is diluted by light from the secondary star ( see section[low ] ) .",
    "after this correction the amplitude of the flares in the continuum compared to the line are similar . from the data presented here for a062000 , some , but not all , flare events that appear in the continuum lightcurve are also present in the emission line , similar to what is observed in the continuum and h@xmath0 lightcurves of v404cyg @xcite .    the wht lightcurves ( figure[fig : wht_lcurves ] )",
    "exhibit no pronounced flares similar to those seen in the vlt data ( figure[fig : vlt_lcurves ] ) .",
    "the continuum lightcurves are relatively smooth , with possibly some weak flares present .",
    "these are not detectable in the h@xmath0 lightcurves , however , and the h@xmath2 data , where present , are too noisy to tell .",
    "it may be that the wht observations represent a less active epoch ; such differences in flare behaviour between epochs do seem to occur in quiescent sxts , and can be very marked ( hynes et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "there have been several photometric studies of a062000  in quiescence which show a distorted double - humped modulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the maxima and minima in the lightcurves vary in height and depth and on occasions the maxima have reversed ( see figure1 of haswell 1996 ) . furthermore , it has been reported that the average optical magnitude varies on a timescale of a few hundred days .",
    "possible explanations for these variations are star - spots on the secondary star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or a persistent superhump @xcite .    to obtain a v - band lightcurve of a062000  from our spectra , we integrated the dereddened spectra with the johnson @xmath26-band filter response .",
    "the resulting lightcurve is typical ; we see the classic distorted double - humped modulation and the maxima have different heights .",
    "our lightcurve resembles the optical lightcurves obtained by @xcite , with the brighter maxima occurring at phase 0.25 .",
    "the uncertainty in the reddening adds a 7 percent uncertainty to the the mean flux level.we use the x - ray binary model described in @xcite with the parameters @xmath7=0.067 , @xmath5=41@xmath6 , @xmath9=11@xmath4 a distance of @xmath27=1164pc and a secondary star with an effective temperature of t@xmath28=4600k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , to determine the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "the excess lightcurve is then obtained by subtracting the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation from the underlying continuum of the de - reddened lightcurve ( see figure[fig : shump ] ) .    to interpret the observed lightcurve we require the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation plus the steady accretion disc s light with excess continuum emission ( i.e. superhump light ) between orbital phase 0.00 and 0.50 .",
    "the mean level of the excess lightcurve i.e. the photometric veiling , suggests that the disc contributes 20 percent to the observed flux .",
    "this is consistent with the disc fraction estimated using the secondary star s absorption lines ( in section[low ] ) , given that the mean level of the ellipsoidal lightcurve is at most only accurate to 20 percent due to the uncertainties in the distance .",
    "although the exact amplitude and flux of the excess lightcurve depends on the model parameters that predict the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation , the result that there is excess light near phase 0.2 remains firm . to determine the colour and possible origin of the excess light we compared the data taken around the maximum of the inferred superhump at orbital phase @xmath290.2 ( see figure[fig : shump ] ) to the data taken one orbital cycle earlier @xmath30)low@xmath240.8 . since the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation contribution will be the same in both cases , any difference in the spectral shape",
    "must be due to a superhump at @xmath31 , or a starspot depressing the ellipsoidal maximum at phase @xmath32 .",
    "the continuum shapes of the spectra taken at @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not signifcantly different .",
    "therefore , our data do not allow us to say if this excess light arises from star - spots or the superhump .",
    "there have been many studies of a062000  where the fractional contributions of the light from the secondary star and accretion disc have been estimated . by subtracting the k secondary star spectrum from the broad - band data of a062000obtained ten months after the 1975 may outburst , @xcite found the total v - band light due to the disc at 5500  to be @xmath33=43@xmath16 percent .",
    "he also determined a power - law form for the disc s light ( @xmath34 ) with an index of -2 .",
    "similarly , using the same analysis , @xcite obtained @xmath33=40@xmath110 percent and @xmath2=-2.5@xmath11.0 for the disc s light in 1985 .",
    "further observations by @xcite showed that the disc s fractional contribution at 5225  is roughly constant at @xmath3542 percent during 19851990 . using high resolution spectroscopy ,",
    "@xcite find that the disc contributes 6@xmath13 percent at h@xmath0 and 17@xmath13 percent at h@xmath2 in 1991/1992 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite the difference in the disc s fractional contribution determined by @xcite and @xcite is probably due to the choice of the template star .",
    "we model the average quiet - state spectrum of a062000  in terms of a template secondary star and non - variable accretion disc spectrum .",
    "we use a k4 spectrum ( hd154712 ) taken from the gunn - stryker atlas @xcite to represent the secondary star and a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath36 to represent the light from the accretion disc .",
    "since the spectral resolution of the a062000  spectrum is higher than the template stars in the gunn - stryker atlas , the spectrum of a062000  was rebinned to the spectral dispersion of the template star ( 10pixel@xmath15 ) .",
    "figure[fig : qspectrum ] shows the results of a spectral synthesis of the continuum emission .",
    "we find that the accretion disc s light has a power - law index of 0.60@xmath10.3 and contributes 37@xmath113 percent to the observed continuum light at 5500 . from the residual of the fit",
    "it can be seen that a power - law model for the disc predicts more flux short - ward of 5000 , so a power - law function does not best describe the disc s light .",
    "if we model the spectrum of the disc with a blackbody function , we obtain a significantly better fit ( at the 99 percent level ) , where the disc contributes 58@xmath116 percent to the continuum flux at 5500  and the disc has a blackbody temperature of 4600@xmath1100k and a radius of 0.50@xmath10.06@xmath37 . using a k3 star in order to match the blue end of the spectrum does not give a better fit ( at the 99.99 percent confidence level . )",
    "all the uncertainties quoted are 1-@xmath22 and have been rescaled so that the @xmath38 of the fit is 1 .",
    "although our determination of the fractional contribution of the accretion disc s light to that observed is consistent with the findings of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the form of power - law description of the disc s light is not .",
    "however , it should be noted that the non - variable accretion disc light is a composite of light from the steady - state accretion disc plus the excess light from star - spots or a late - superhump , which most probably have very different spectral shapes . for the case where the excess light is due to a late - superhump , the late - superhump modulation may have its origin in the outer regions of the disc in the changing stream - disc interaction ( rolfe , haswell & pattterson 2001 ) , the spectrum of the late - superhump is expected to be different compared to the steady - state disc . although the tidally heated stream - disc impact region will be hotter than the rest of the outer disc , it is not obvious how much hotter this will be compared to the inner regions of the disc , where viscous stresses due to differential rotation are much higher .",
    "thus it is difficult to estimate the spectrum of the late - superhump without detailed computations .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that the disc s light and spectrum are observed to change with time , as it just reflects the variable behaviour of the accretion disc .",
    "assuming that the light produced by the flares is simply added to the quiescent spectrum which contains the secondary star and light from the accretion disc ( assumed to be non - variable ) , the difference between flare - state spectra and the quiet - state spectra yields an estimate for the spectrum of the flares .",
    "the actual portions of the lightcurves used to determine the flare - state and quiet - state spectra are marked in figure[fig : flarepos ] and were selected after subtracting the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "figure[fig : fspectrum ] shows the resulting spectrum , which has been binned for clarity .",
    "we compared the average flare spectrum taken during the beginning and end of the night .",
    "they were found to be the same to within 1.5 percent . before the subtraction",
    "we shift the spectra into the rest frame of the secondary star , so that the features from the secondary are removed cleanly .",
    "the r - band mag varies on a timescale of a few hundred days with an amplitude of 0.3 mag @xcite .",
    "however , since this timescale is much longer than the orbital period it is safe to assume that the lightcurve of the superhump of excess light does not change shape over the length of the orbital period .",
    "the flare spectrum has a relatively flat continuum suggesting that a high temperature model is needed to fit the data .",
    "we attempt to fit the flare spectrum with different models .",
    "a fit using a blackbody ( @xmath39=3.93 ) gives a temperature of 5900@xmath1200k and a radius 0.14@xmath10.10@xmath37  ( 90 percent confidence ) .",
    "a power - law fit ( @xmath39=3.85 ) of the form @xmath34 has an index of -0.60@xmath10.20 , or @xmath40 ( 90 percent confidence ) .",
    "a more realistic model is a continuum emission spectrum of an lte slab of hydrogen . using the synthetic photometry synphot package ( iraf / stsdas ) to compute the lte models we fit the continuum regions to estimate the temperature , radius and baryon column density of the slab .",
    "we find that the @xmath21 surface has a broad minimum at @xmath39 of @xmath244 .",
    "the requirement that the flare region is smaller than the area of the accretion disc ( 0.5@xmath41 ; @xcite ) adds a weak constraint , only ruling out temperatures less than @xmath245000k .",
    "we constrain the temperature and equivalent radius of the optically thin lte slab to lie in the range 1000014200k and 0.0320.044 @xmath37  ( 99 percent confidence ) for a baryon column density in the range 10@xmath4210@xmath43 nucleons@xmath44 ( see figure[fig : chi ] ) .",
    "the emission covers 0.050.08 percent ( 99 percent confidence ) of the accretion disc s projected surface area ( @xmath7=0.067 , @xmath5=41@xmath45 and @xmath9=11@xmath4 ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "tight constraints on the parameters of interest can not be placed because of the correlations between the temperature and column density ; a high temperature and low column density model gives the same @xmath21 as a low temperature and high column density model .",
    "although this can only be done by using the balmer emission line fluxes , for a062000  this is very difficult as it is clear that the balmer emission lines are contaminated by the emission from the bright - spot ( see section[doppler ] ) .",
    "aeaqr is an unusual cataclysmic variable in that it exhibits flaring behaviour which can be described in the framework of a magnetic propeller that throws out gas out of the binary system @xcite .",
    "the flares are thought to arise from collisions between high - density regions in the material expelled from the system after interaction with the rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the flares in aeaqr can be described by a optically thin gas with a temperature of 800012,000k @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the flares seen in a062000  are described by optically thin gas with a similar temperature , it seems unlikely that the same mechanism producing the flares in aeaqr operates in the sxts .",
    "[ although the temperature of the large flares in v404cyg have been estimated to be @xmath248000k , the uncertainties should be noted @xcite . ]",
    "doppler tomography is a powerful tool in the study of accretion disc kinematics and emission properties @xcite .",
    "this analysis method is now a widespread procedure in the study of emission - line profiles in both cataclysmic variables and low - mass x - ray binaries , providing a quantitative mapping of optically thin emission regions in the velocity space . when intrinsic doppler broadening by bulk flow is present , the tomograms provide a concise and convenient form of displaying phase - resolved line profiles .",
    "however , there are several assumptions inherrant in doppler tomography that should be noted ; it is assumed that the emission is fixed in the co - rotating frame , the emission does not vary over the binary orbit and the motion is in the orbital plane . if these assumptions are not valid then doppler tomography can produce artefacts @xcite .",
    "the balmer line profiles show the doubled peaked structure typical of an accretion disc , and periodic changes in the strength of the two emission peaks which are attributed to s - wave emission components ( see figure[fig : dopmaps ] ) . the trailed spectra show two s - wave components . prior to constructing the doppler images , the spectra were re - binned onto a constant velocity scale ( 60 @xmath3pixel@xmath15 ) and then continuum subtracted using a spline fit to the continuum regions close to the balmer lines .",
    "when computing the doppler maps , we use the systemic velocity determined from the secondary star s absorption radial velocity curve @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 doppler images show a broad ring background which is the emission from the accretion disc extending to high velocities .",
    "the images also show regions of entended enhanced emission at the position of the stream / disc impact point and extended emission from the opposite side of the disc .    in figure[fig :",
    "dopmaps ] we show paths for the gas stream and the kepler velocity of the disc along the gas stream for @xmath7=0.067 and @xmath18=433@xmath3",
    ". the bright - spot does not lie on either predicted path for the gas stream , but occurs half - way between them as is observed in ugem @xcite .",
    "as explained by @xcite the most probable explanation for this is that we are seeing gas around the bright - spot after it has passed through the shock at the edge of the accretion disc . assuming that the velocity after the shock is a combination of the velocity of the gas stream and accretion disc",
    ", we can estimate the radius of the post - shock emission , which most probably corresponds to the accretion disc radius . from the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 maps",
    "we deduce a radius of @xmath46=0.55@xmath10.05@xmath41 ( where @xmath41is the distance the the inner lagrangian point ) , similar to the values determined previously , @xmath470.5@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 data suggest an anti - correlation with the continuum lightcurves , in both the wht and vlt datasets . such an effect",
    "would , of course , be expected in the equivalent width , but not in the fluxes .",
    "given that the effect repeats between the two independent datasets , this is unlikely an artifact , and probably rather indicates a real modulation in the h@xmath0 flux .",
    "such an effect can be explained if it originates from a more optically thick region for which we see a varying projected area . in this case , a double - humped modulation , analogous to ellipsoidal modulations , is expected .",
    "the most likely region to be responsible for this is the accretion stream impact and/or overflow , since the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 doppler tomograms show that this region is much more prominent in h@xmath2 relative to the disc than in h@xmath0 , as expected if the h@xmath0 emission arises from more optically thick regions than the disc .",
    "furthermore , we would expect emission to be out of phase with the ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "the phase of maximum light would depend on the disc radius and how extended the stream impact region is , but up to a shift of 0.2 or so in phase relative to the ellipsoidal modulations is not implausible .",
    "superhumps are optical modulations that arise when an accretion disc expands to the resonance radius , becomes elliptical and is forced to precess @xcite .",
    "it is believed that enhanced viscous dissipation in the eccentric disc due to the tidal stress exerted by the secondary star is the source of light observed in the superhump lightcurves .",
    "such an eccentric disc which gives rise to asymmetric emission line profiles , has been successfully used to explain the asymmetric line profiles in oycar @xcite , zcha ( @xcite , @xcite ) and amcvn @xcite .",
    "the doppler maps of a062000  presented here show significant extended emission , strongest in h@xmath0 , with similar velocities to the stream / disc impact point , but from the opposite side of the disc between phase 0.25 and 0.50 ( see figure[fig : dopmaps ] ) .",
    "this crescent - like structure is reminiscent of the feature seen in the doppler maps of xtej2123 - 058 in quiescence @xcite .",
    "also , the orbital average h@xmath0 profiles of xtej1118 + 480 near quiescence show significant velocity variations and can be interpreted as evidence for an eccentric precessing disc @xcite .",
    "thus the most likely explanation for the crescent structure seen in the doppler maps of a062000  presented here , is that it is due to an elliptical accretion disc .",
    "however , it should be noted that such structure is not seen in the doppler maps determined by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see what the doppler map of an eccentric disc would look like .",
    "@xcite have attempted to compute such a map and find that the doppler map of an eccentric disc is shifted with respect to the system s centre of mass with asymmetric enhancements in intensity around the edge of wthe disc .",
    "more recently , @xcite have performed detailed 2-d smoothed particle hydrodymanical ( sph ) simulations of an eccentric precessing disc in a binary system .",
    "the synthetic trailed spectra show two distinct non - sinusoidal s - wave features which evolve with the disc precession phase which are produced by the gas stream and the disc gas at the stream - disc impact shock .",
    "these emission regions are not fixed in the co - rotating frame and vary with time over the binary orbit . to show the effects of using data that violate the assumptions inherrant in dopper tomography , the authors produce maximum entropy doppler maps of the sph trailed spectra .",
    "they find that an artefact of doppler tomography is that the stream impact emission is reconstructed in velocity space as a broad emission region between the gas stream ballistic path and the velocity of a circular keplerian disc along the ballistic stream trajectory i.e. the stream s `` kepler shadow '' ( see figure9 of @xcite ) .    in both the h@xmath0 and",
    "h@xmath2 trailed spectra of a062000 , characteristic rapidly turning red - blue - red non - sinusoidal s - wave features between orbital phases 0.2 and 0.6 are seen , and look very similar to the simulated sph trailed spectra of a precessing disc .",
    "the reconstructed data between phase 0.8 and 1.0 indicate that the real data are not well reproduced by sum of sinusoids that vary on the orbital period .",
    "if there is an eccentric precessing disc , as there must be if there is a superhump , the emission regions are not fixed in the co - rotating frame , it is not surprising that doppler tomography fails .",
    "furthermore , the broad emission near the stream / disc impact region can be interpreted as the artefact of doppler tomography , which blurs the emission produced by the gas stream and the disc gas at the stream - disc impact region .",
    "thus qualitatively our data suggests the presence of a precessing disc in a062000 .",
    "given the mass ratio of a062000 , the 3:1 resonance is the dominant tidal instability and lies at @xmath48=0.66@xmath41 .",
    "although we derive a disc radius less than this value ( see section[bspot ] ) , it should be noted that we actually determine the post - shock radius of the gas stream as it impacts the accretion disc , which most probably lies close to but not on the edge of the accretion disc .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that the effective radius of the disc as measured by the stream - disc impact region changes dramatically with superhump phase .",
    "thus the method of doppler tomography will estimate a mean value for the disc s radius .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the radius of the accretion disc extends up to the tidal radius and so the asymmetric brightness distribution in the accretion disc we observed can be explained by the presence of a tidally distorted accretion disc .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed an accretion flow model to explain the observations of quiescent black hole x - ray transients .",
    "the accretion disc has two components , an inner hot advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) that extends from the black hole horizon to a transition radius and a thin accretion disc that extends from the transition disc to the edge of the accretion disc .",
    "interactions between the hot inner adaf and the cool , outer thin disc , at or near the transition radius could be a source of quasi - periodic variability .",
    "the adaf flow requires electrons in the gas to cool via synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton processes which predict the form of the spectrum from radio to hard x - rays .",
    "it has been suggested that the flares observed in a062000  and other quiescent x - ray transients arise from the transition radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the 0.78mhz feature detected in v404cyg has been used to determine the transition radius , assuming that the periodicity represents the keplerian period at the transition between the thin and advective disc regions @xcite , and a possible low frequency break in the power spectrum of a062000  may have a related origin @xcite . in the original adaf models the optical flux is produced by synchrotron emission . as pointed out in @xcite , it is difficult to explain the flare spectrum in terms of optically thin synchrotron emission , unless the electrons follow a much steeper power - law electron energy distribution compared to solar flares ; solar and stellar flares have a frequency spectrum with a power - law index of @xmath0=0.5 and an electron energy distribution with a power - law index of @xmath242",
    ".    however , more recently the adaf models have been questioned , and substantial modifications proposed .",
    "@xcite emphasised that the bernoulli constant of the gas is positive and hence outflows are possible ( as also noted by @xcite ) . in the adiabatic inflow outflow solution ( adios )",
    "model of @xcite most of the accretion energy that is released near the black hole is used to drive a wind from the surface of the accretion disc .",
    "most of the gas that falls onto the outer edge of the accretion disc is carried by this wind away from the black hole , with the result that the hole s accretion rate is much smaller than the disc s accretion rate .",
    "advective flows are also expected to be convectively unstable , as also remarked by @xcite . in these models the central accretion rate",
    "can also be suppressed . for either of these cases ,",
    "the effect is to shift the source of cooling outwards , and the optical synchrotron emission is reduced ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these more realistic cases",
    "@xmath49 flares directly from the inner flow are less likely .",
    "optical emission might still arise from the inner edge of the outer ( thin ) disc , or from reprocessing of x - ray variability .",
    "it was argued by @xcite that since large ( @xmath24 few d ) flares in v404cyg involve enhancements of both blue and red wings of h@xmath0 , they must involve the whole disc .",
    "while these observations indicate participation by a wide range of azimuths , they leave open the possibility that only the inner disc is involved . using simultaneous multicolour photometry @xcite determined the colour of similar large flares in v404cyg .",
    "although the flare parameters determined are complicated by uncertainties in the interstellar reddening , the flare temperature was estimated to be @xmath248000k .",
    "flares on timescales similar to those present in a062000  ( i.e. tens of minutes ) were also observed , but no physical parameters could be determined given the large uncertainties in the colour .",
    "the large ( @xmath24 few hrs ) flares were observed to arise from regions that cover at least 3 percent of the disc s surface area . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the large ( @xmath24 few hrs ) flares in v404cyg are produced in regions further out or further above the disc from a corona than the rapid ( @xmath240.5hr ) and more rapid ( @xmath24min ) flares .",
    "if the flares in v404cyg and a062000  have the same origin , then it is interesting to note that the large flares ( @xmath24 few hrs ) observed in v404cyg cover a larger surface area of the disc compared to the rapid ( tens of mins ) flares observed in a062000 , which is consistent with the idea that the large flares arise from regions that extend further out into the disc compared to the rapid flares . although the flare temperatures derived suggest that large flares are cooler than rapid flares , the uncertainties are large and so no meaningful conclusion can be drawn at this stage .",
    "accurate physical parameters for the flares can only be obtained by resolving the balmer jump and paschen continuum .      for the data presented here on a062000 , there is evidence that some of the flare events in the continuum lightcurve are correlated with the balmer emission line lightcurves , similar to what is observed in v404cyg @xcite .",
    "the value for the balmer decrement suggests that the persistent flux is optically thin and the decrease of the balmer decrement during the flares suggests a significant temperature increase .",
    "we find that the optically thin spectrum of the flare , which lasts tens of minutes , has a temperature of @xmath2412000k and covers 0.08 percent of the disc s projected surface area ( see section[flare ] )",
    ".    in many high inclination systems the continuum light from the bright - spot produces a single hump in the lightcurve , because the bright - spot is obscured by the disc when it is on the side of the disc facing away from the observer .",
    "since a062000  is at an intermediate inclination angle ( 41@xmath6 ; @xcite and @xcite ) where no strong obscuration effects are predicted , it is not surprising that the continuum lightcurve does not show obvious evidence of a bright - spot . from the doppler maps of a062000  ( see section[bspot ] ) , it is clear that the bright - spot is present in the balmer emission lines .",
    "if the bright spot were present in the continuum then we would expect strong correlations between the continuum and emission line lightcurves .",
    "indeed we see some evidence for such correlations in the lightcurves ( see figures[fig : vlt_lcurves ] and [ fig : wht_lcurves ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the flare temperature and area we obtain ( see section[flare ] ) is consistent with the bright - spot temperature and radius determined by @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the data presented here we can not rule out the possibility that the flares arise from the bright - spot .",
    "although , this hypothesis can only be tested by observing high inclination x - ray transients , where one would expect the orbital distribution of the flares and lightcurves to be indicative , it should be noted that the kinematics of the flares in v404cyg do rule out at least some of the flares coming from the bright spot .",
    "we have presented a time - resolved spectrophotometric quiescent study of the optical variability in a062000 .",
    "we observe the well known flare events which and find that some of the events appear in both the continuum and the emission line lightcurves .",
    "the balmer line flux and variations suggest that that the persistent emission is optically thin and the drop in the balmer decrement for the flare event at phase 1.15 , suggests that either a significant increase in temperature occurred during the flare or that the flare is more optically thick than the continuum .",
    "the data suggests that there are two hi emitting regions , the accretion disc and the accretion stream / disc region , with different balmer decrements .",
    "the orbital modulation of h@xmath0 with the continuum suggests that the steeper decrement is most likely associated with the stream / disc impact region .",
    "we find that flare spectrum can be described by an optically thin gas with a temperature in the range 1000014000k that covers 0.050.08 percent ( 90 percent confidence ) of the accretion disc s surface . given these parameters ,",
    "the possibility that the flares arise from the bright - spot can not be ruled out .",
    "finally , doppler images of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 emission show enhanced emission at the stream / disc impacts region as well as extended structure from the opposite side of the disc .",
    "the trailed spectra show characteristic s - wave features that can be interpreted in the context of an eccentric accretion disc .",
