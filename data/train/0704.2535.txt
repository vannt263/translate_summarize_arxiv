    "galaxy clusters are ideal probes for studies of large scale structures .",
    "they have typical masses of order @xmath0 ; within a radius of a few mpc they contain hundreds of galaxies orbiting in a gravitational potential well due primarily to dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "they are also filled with icm : hot ionized gas , typically at a temperature of 1 - 15 kev , that can be observed via its bremsstrahlung emission in the soft x - ray band , and via the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in the millimetric band .    several observational evidences",
    "demonstrate that the picture of an icm in hydrostatic equilibrium in the dm potential well of the cluster is an over - simplification : above all , scaling relations between various cluster properties , like mass , temperature and x - ray luminosity , differ from the self - similar predictions ( see , e.g. , the recent reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) .",
    "in order to explain the icm properties , many models have been developed so far , which consider the effect of radiative cooling and of non - gravitational heating ( mainly feedback from supernovae and agns ) .",
    "as the complexity in the physical description of the icm increased , hydrodynamic simulations have also improved to include such processes , and have become invaluable tools to compare theoretical predictions with current data and to forecast the performance of future experiments .    on the observational side ,",
    "important improvements are expected for the detection of the sz effect in clusters thanks to an upcoming new generation of suitable instruments , like ami , spt , act , sza , amiba , apex , and planck . in order to correctly extract and utilize the information contained in these data",
    "it will be mandatory to keep under control both the dependence of the sz signal on the icm physics , and the possible biases induced on the intrinsic signal by the details of the observational process .    in the present work",
    "we investigate how different choices for the physical modelling of the icm affect the sz radial profiles and the scaling relations between the sz flux and other intrinsic properties of clusters . to this end",
    ", we use a set of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations , where clusters were re - simulated including different physical processes , from radiative cooling , to star formation , energy feedback from supernovae , and thermal conduction .    after this analysis",
    ", we adopt the instrumental characteristics of the ami interferometer and simulate the observational process for a few clusters in our sample : this enable us to discuss possible biases introduced in our results by a realistic observation process .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly introducing in sect .",
    "[ sec : uno ] the sz effect and the main related quantities , in sect .",
    "[ sec : due ] we describe the general characteristics of the hydrodynamic simulations used in our study . in sect .",
    "[ sec : tre ] we obtain fitting formulas for the cluster sz profiles , while in sect .",
    "[ sec : quattro ] we discuss the effects of various physical processes on the scaling relations between some global properties commonly used to describe galaxy clusters . in sect .",
    "[ sec : cinque ] we perform simulated observations assuming the characteristics of the ami instrument , and discuss the robustness of our results . finally in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the thermal sz effect @xcite is a distorsion in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum due to inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by hot ionized gas particles ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its intensity is given by the comptonization parameter @xmath1 , defined as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the thomson cross section , @xmath5 is the speed of light , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electronic number density , temperature and rest mass , respectively . as evident from eq.([eq : y ] ) , the @xmath1-parameter is directly proportional to the cluster pressure @xmath9 integrated along the line of sight .",
    "the change in the cmb intensity at the frequency @xmath10 corresponding to a certain value of the comptonization parameter is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the planck constant .",
    "the frequency dependence is given by the spectral shape @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .    in galaxy clusters the comptonization parameter @xmath1 typically reaches values of order @xmath16 on arc - minute scales , corresponding to fluctuations in the cmb temperature of few @xmath17 .",
    "as a consequence , observing galaxy clusters through the sz effect requires extremely good sensitivity , in order to obtain sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratios . the required sensitivity and sky coverage will be achieved in the near future , thanks to new dedicated instruments .",
    "nevertheless , the resolution of these instruments will be not enough to detect the wealth of details which can be seen in numerical hydrodynamical simulations : substructures , shocks , etc .",
    "for this reason , in order to be meaningful and helpful , all analyses of the sz effect based on simulations must deal with the actual instrumental capabilities : this is one of the main goals of this paper , as discussed below .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations used in the present work were carried out using gadget-2 @xcite , a new version of the parallel tree+sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) code gadget @xcite .",
    "gadget-2 includes an entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite , radiative cooling , heating by an uv background , and a treatment of star formation and feedback from galactic winds powered by supernova explosions .",
    "the latter is based on a subresolution model for the multi - phase structure of the interstellar medium , as described in @xcite .",
    "the sph implementation of thermal conduction in gadget-2 , which is both stable and manifestly conserves thermal energy - even when individual and adaptive time - steps are used - was described in @xcite .",
    "this implementation assumes an isotropic effective conductivity parameterized as a fixed fraction of the spitzer rate .",
    "it also accounts for saturation , which can become relevant for low - density gas .",
    ".different physical processes included in our re - simulations [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     . for comparison ,",
    "the thin lines refer to the corresponding mean logarithmic sz profiles directly extracted from the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "only the hm sample at @xmath18 is considered here.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "we used a sample of simulated galaxy clusters with masses ranging from @xmath19 to about @xmath20 , re - simulated using different sets of physical processes ( radiative cooling , star formation , feedback and thermal conduction ) to investigate the dependence of the sz emission on the icm physics .",
    "starting from the 3d pressure information , we obtained for each physics fitting relations to the sz radial profiles .",
    "we compared the scaling relations linking cluster central and total sz flux , and cluster x - ray luminosity and ( mass - weighted ) temperature , with those predicted by the self - similar model .",
    "we then performed mock observations of the most massive systems in our sample , in order to check whether our findings survive the observational procedure .",
    "we summarize our main results below .",
    "* the shape of the sz cluster profile strongly depends on the cluster mass , as a result of the fact that our high mass clusters , at variance with the low mass ones , are all isolated and virialized .",
    "in particular , while the 3d ( logarithmic ) pressure profiles of low - mass clusters ( lm sample ) can be described by a function which is nearly flat for @xmath21 and steepening for @xmath22 , the high - mass clusters ( hm sample ) exhibit an additional steepening of the profiles at @xmath23 . *",
    "the details of the icm physics have little impact on the sz profiles ; the largest differences are found near the central regions of low - mass systems . *",
    "the scaling relations between cluster sz emission and cluster x - ray luminosity and temperature evolve with redshift according to the self - similar model out to @xmath24 ; this result is consistent with previous works @xcite . *",
    "the slopes of the scaling relations for all physics are consistent with the predictions of the self - similar model , even if small discrepancies can still be found : in particular , our empirical relations @xmath25 and @xmath26 are generally slightly steeper than the self - similar ones , while the @xmath27 relation is generally slightly shallower .",
    "* the icm physics has little effect on the slopes of the scaling relations , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "* the main effect introduced in the scaling relations by radiative cooling is a lower normalization .",
    "if we compare our simulations including cooling with the non - radiative runs with standard viscosity ( _ ovisc _ ) , we find a suppression of @xmath28 per cent in the central intensity @xmath29 and of @xmath30 per cent in the integrated flux @xmath31 . if we compare the cooling plus star - formation runs with the non - radiative ones adopting modified artificial viscosity ( _ lvisc _ ) , these reductions are of the order of @xmath32 per cent . a similar normalization lowering for the @xmath27 relation was also found by @xcite .",
    "* our mock observations suggest that arcminute resolution data from the current generation of sze imaging experiments will not be a sensitive probe of the different physics that is ongoing in the intracluster medium . at arcminute scale angular resolution",
    "these effects tend to only have observable consequences on the total cluster flux , which leads to a degeneracy between physics and cluster mass that will be difficult to break * the integrated flux @xmath31 is found to be stable against the observational process , and thus should be preferred to @xmath29 , which instead exhibits large variations after performing the mock observations .",
