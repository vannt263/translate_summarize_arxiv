    "electromagnetic metamaterials , periodically arranged sub - wavelength structures , can be used to interact with radiation in ways generally unattainable with natural materials . in the form of metal mesh grids , they have been used since the 1960 s by authors such as ulrich  @xcite to create polarisers and filters .",
    "the grids properties were based on the inductive and capacitive responses that radiation had to the grids geometries . in the past decade",
    "such grids have been rediscovered primarily for their use in producing negative refractive indices ( nri ) , and also for their ability to be designed with customised electromagnetic properties .",
    "this technology finds applications in the microwave and terahertz frequency ranges where the availability of suitable dielectric materials that can be used to manufacture optical components is very limited .",
    "most uses for nri have focused on cases where isotropic behaviour is required e.g.  in the creation of `` perfect lenses '' @xcite .",
    "however , polarisation dependent responses can be used to design birefringent metamaterials and hence wave plates . wave plates ( or retarders ) are optical devices that alter the polarisation state of radiation transmitted through them .",
    "half wave plates ( hwps ) are a particular type of wave plate used to arbitrarily rotate the polarisation angle of linearly polarised radiation .",
    "they find application when linear polarisation modulation is required . in these cases , a hwp rotating at a frequency , @xmath1 , is placed in front of a linearly polarised detector . in this setup , the intensity of linearly polarised radiation reaching the detector varies with a frequency of @xmath2 whilst the intensity of unpolarised radiation is unaffected .",
    "this allows the detector to discriminate between radiation from polarised and unpolarised sources .    in this paper ,",
    "nri will be used in combination with positive refractive indices ( pri ) to create a highly birefringent hwp .",
    "this idea has been applied in @xcite where the results were very narrowband . in order in to increase the bandwidth in this work the pancharatnam method @xcite",
    "is employed for first time with nri based wave plates .",
    "a common way to design wave plates is to use uniaxial birefringent materials . assuming a cartesian coordinate system , a uniaxial birefringent material has refractive index values such that @xmath3 .",
    "radiation propagating through these materials experience different refractive indices depending on the radiation s initial polarisation state and propagation direction .",
    "this implies that two orthogonal polarisation components can travel at different speeds through the material causing a differential phase shift , @xmath4 , so altering the polarisation state from that of the incoming radiation . by cutting a slab of a uniaxial birefringent material with its entrance and exit surfaces parallel to the material s optic axis",
    ", a wave plate is created . for a given frequency , @xmath1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 produced by a wave plate of thickness , @xmath5 , is equal to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the free space speed of light and @xmath8 , a quantity known as the birefringence . to create a hwp , the radiation passing through it",
    "must experience a @xmath4 of .    in the mm - wavelength range",
    ", there are not many birefringent materials available for the manufacture of wave plates .",
    "commonly used materials include sapphire and quartz , both of which have @xmath9 @xcite . for a fixed frequency",
    "it can be seen from equation   that the @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "so using materials with low birefringence values leads to thicker wave plates with an increased amount of weight and absorption compared to thinner wave plates made of the same material .",
    "the weight consideration is important in cases where large diameters ( ) are required at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "an alternative to natural materials would be to use the aforementioned metamaterials . by designing them",
    "so that they present a pri to one polarisation and a nri to the orthogonal polarisation , a @xmath10 greater than unity can be created .",
    "this would allow the manufacturing of subwavelength thick wave plates , much thinner than those made with birefringent materials .",
    "this idea was applied in @xcite to produce a hwp and a qwp .",
    "the grids used in @xcite are similar to the capacitive grids used for mesh filters in @xcite . to create a nri the grids",
    "were paired up in the radiation s propagation direction .",
    "resonances in the individual grids result in a negative permittivity , whilst the anti - parallel currents in the grid pair produces a current loop allowing the production of a negative permeability .",
    "when these two conditions occur in the same frequency range a nri is produced .",
    "the resulting wave plates made in this way however had very narrow usable bandwidths .",
    "this was due to the large gradient of @xmath4 against @xmath1 due to the resonance of the metamaterial required to produce the nri . if we define the usable bandwidth for a hwp as the region where @xmath11 , the hwp from @xcite had a fractional bandwidth of .",
    "in this paper we use the pancharatnam method @xcite to increase the usable bandwidth .",
    "originally developed for wave plates operating at optical frequencies , the same method can be applied at any frequency e.g.  at millimetre wavelengths @xcite , as well as with different polarisation manipulation technologies e.g.  waveguide based polarisation rotators @xcite .",
    "the pancharatnam method requires a number of wave plates to be placed one after the other with their optic axes rotated by specific angles .",
    "this is similar to the schematic shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : panch ] , although when using wave plates made from regular birefringent materials , they are typically in physical contact with one another . a single wave plate of thickness , @xmath5 , and birefringence , @xmath10 , is only able to produce the required @xmath4 at a single frequency . by using @xmath12 wave plates rotated by different angles , @xmath13 ,",
    "the required @xmath4 may be crossed at @xmath12 different frequencies . by optimising the rotation angles of the cascaded set of wave plates , a broadening of the usable bandwidth",
    "can be achieved .",
    "metallic meshes are generally made as a two - dimensional array of repeated structures .",
    "these can be simulated using commercial electromagnetic finite element method ( fem ) solvers such as ansys hfss @xcite by modelling just the smallest repeatable element , the unit cell . by applying periodic boundary conditions to the unit cell",
    ", an infinite two - dimensional array of cells can be easily simulated without requiring large computing resources .    the unit cell design adopted in this work",
    "is based on a `` dog bone '' structure ( fig .  [ fig : dbt ] ) , previously used in @xcite .",
    "the design was chosen for its birefringent properties , and its ability to produce a nri band only along a single polarisation direction .",
    "the final structure consisted of three copper dog bone grids supported by a polypropylene ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite ) substrate .",
    "henceforth this structure will be referred to as a dog bone triplet ( dbt ) .",
    "the dimensions of the dog bones and the thickness of the substrate were optimised so that a single unit cell would be able to produce @xmath16 at , the centre of the w - band ( ) . additionally the transmitted intensity along the @xmath17- and @xmath18-polarisations , @xmath19 was at the same frequency .",
    "the final optimised dimensions are listed in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : dbt ] .    , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the thickness of the copper is . ]",
    "due to the pancahratnam method requiring a number of wave plates to be cascaded one after the other with different arbitrary angles , the available periodic boundary conditions in hfss could not be used on a cascaded set of dbt unit cells .",
    "the use of fem modelling to optimise the pancharatnam based hwp would have required a set of cascaded full sized dbt based hwps .",
    "this would have been computationally prohibitive in terms of the cpu time and ram required .",
    "our alternative approach is based on a transmission line ( tl ) model .",
    "the use of tl modelling for meshes is well known @xcite and involves the individual grids being represented by a suitable combination of lumped elements e.g.  capacitors and inductors .",
    "different grid designs can be represented by equivalent circuits based on different combinations of lumped elements . using available analytical equations , the frequency dependent behaviour of the grid",
    "may be easily computed . when modelling a cascade of grids , each grid can be represented by a transmission matrix , such as those described in @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements are still based on the same analytical equations . to calculate the final transmission and reflection of such devices ,",
    "the much less computationally intensive process of matrix multiplication can be carried out .    however , this method of analytical matrix seeding is unsuitable when very accurate values of the phase are required @xcite . to achieve accurate phase values ,",
    "data obtained from fem simulations of the grids were used to `` seed '' the matrix elements , instead of relying on quantities derived analytically . to do this ,",
    "the s - parameters from an fem simulation are extracted and converted into abcd transmission matrices @xcite .",
    "the exact formalism of the pancharatnam method used is based on @xcite , where rotation matrices are used to allow the modelling of the wave plates rotations . a tl model consisting of three",
    "dbt hwps was optimised by varying the rotation angles of the individual hwps and the thickness of the air gaps between them .",
    "the optimisation goal was set to maximise the frequency range where @xmath23 and the transmitted intensities for both polarisations were equal to each other . using the nomenclature from fig .",
    "[ fig : panch ] the optimised parameters were : @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the manufacture of the individual dog bone grids was carried out using standard photolithographic techniques .",
    "the process involves evaporating a layer of copper on to a polypropylene substrate . the copper is then coated with an even layer of positive photoresist .",
    "a photomask consisting of the positive of the grid design is placed over the sample and the entire system is exposed to ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation . the sample is then etched to remove the regions of copper where the photoresist was exposed to the uv radiation , leaving behind the copper that was protected by the photomask .    to create the individual dbt hwps ,",
    "three grids were manually aligned on top of each another with polypropylene spacers placed between them to provide the necessary separations .",
    "the individual grids and layers of polypropylene were then hot pressed together inside a vacuum oven to form a single structure . to provide support to the hwps as well as",
    "provide the required thickness of the air gaps between them , the hwps were mounted on thick aluminium rings .",
    "transmission measurements of the individual hwps were then taken to test their performance before they were combined into the full pancharatnam hwp structure .",
    "the pancharatnam hwp was then created by stacking the individual ring mounted hwps on top of each other . to ensure the hwps were rotated by the correct amount the required rotation angles were marked on to the circumference of the rings and the markings were used to aid the aligning .",
    "normal incidence transmission measurements were taken using the experimental setup shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "the pancharatnam hwp is held in a specially designed holder between the two w - band heads of a rhode & schwarz zva40 vector network analyser ( vna ) .",
    "the heads are placed off - axis to one another but at the same height and in such a way that the line connecting the two heads bisect the hwp perpendicularly .",
    "having the heads off - axis allows the reduction of unwanted standing waves between the hwp and the heads .",
    "although the hwp is no longer illuminated using the central portion of the horn beams , the polarisation vectors of the emitting and receiving heads are still aligned .",
    "this is crucial for polarisation measurements where cross polarisation leakages needs to be minimised .",
    "the requirement that the line connecting the horns perpendicularly bisect the hwp means that it is illuminated by a nearly planar wave front , closely matching the conditions that were modelled .",
    "eccosorb was appropriately placed around the setup to further reduce unwanted reflections .",
    "due to the existence of a nri along the @xmath17-axis , @xmath17-polarised radiation incident at non - normal angles would be refracted in the opposite manner within the wave plate than if it had a pri . for a single dbt this behaviour",
    "could be detected by measuring the lateral shift of the transmitted beam @xcite .",
    "however in our experimental setup , although the vna heads were positioned off - axis , the radiation incident on the plate was at almost normal incidence and the effect was neither expected nor observed . in the case of the full pancharatnam hwp illuminated with off - axis radiation , the behaviour would be even more complicated , both due to the dbts optic axes being rotated with respect to one another as well as the polarisation dependent behaviour observed with non - normal incidence on metal mesh grids @xcite .",
    "a fem simulated frequency sweep of the optimised dbt grid showed that a single hwp made from a single dbt grid was able to meet the set requirements .",
    "@xmath27 between and , providing a usable fractional bandwidth of ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dbt - dp-123 ] , dashed line ) .",
    "this narrow bandwidth is caused by the large magnitude of @xmath4 s gradient when it crosses .",
