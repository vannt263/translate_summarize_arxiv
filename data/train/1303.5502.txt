    "the genius mathematician srinivasa ramanujan discovered nearly 3900 results  @xcite , many without proofs ; nearly all his claims have been proven correct .",

    "theorem_. while we do nt know how ramanujan s mind was able to `` discover '' mathematical true facts , we can ask whether there is a way to understand , and possibly imitate , his approach .    in this paper a new type of quantum computer",

    "we construct a quantum system in such a way that the elements of @xmath2 are exactly the eigenvalues of the hermitian operator representing an observable of the quantum system , i.e.  the spectrum of the operator .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 can be represented by the energy of the associated quantum system .",
    "the operator associated to @xmath3 has a special numerical form which guarantees that by measurement we get both the element and the proof that the element is in @xmath2 .",
    "_ we conjecture that the spectral representation is valid for all computably enumerable sets . _",
    "when @xmath1 codes the theorems of a formal system , then the associated quantum computer produces through measurement the theorems of the formal system and their proofs .",
    "the conjecture implies that every theorem of a general ( recursively axiomatisable ) formal system , like peano arithmetic or zfc , can be produced through measurement .",
    "however , we argue that in this general case the quantum procedure produces , like ramanujan , only the true the statement , but not its proof . of course , the proof can be algorithmically generated by a classical algorithm , albeit in a possibly very long time ( such a computation makes sense only for statements recognised as `` interesting '' ) .",
    "for example , if the riemann hypothesis is produced by the quantum procedure we will know that the famous hypothesis is true .",
    "however , to have a formal proof  whose existence is guaranteed by the correctness of the quantum procedure  we may need to run a very long classical procedure .",
    "the proof obtained in this way could be rather unsatisfactory , as it may not convey the `` understanding '' , the reason for which the riemann hypothesis holds true ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we propose a new type of quantum computer which is used to prove a spectral representation for a class @xmath0 of computable sets . when @xmath1 codes the theorems of a formal system , the quantum computer produces through measurement all theorems and proofs of the formal system . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the spectral representation is valid for all computably enumerable sets . </S>",
    "<S> the conjecture implies that the theorems of a general formal system , like peano arithmetic or zfc , can be produced through measurement ; however , it is unlikely that the quantum computer can produce the proofs as well , as in the particular case of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis suggests that showing the provability of a statement is different from writing up the proof of the statement . </S>"
