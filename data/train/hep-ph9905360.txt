    "while these wave functions reproduce the meson mass spectrum very well , it became necessary to introduce dirac and pauli form factors on the level of the constituent quarks  ( cq ) in order to reproduce hadronic meson properties .",
    "this has been done to calculate the charge form factor of the pion , the radiative @xmath4 and @xmath5 transition form factors  @xcite ( both including dirac and pauli cq form factors ) and the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath3 meson  @xcite ( dirac cq form factor only ) .",
    "recently  @xcite , however , it was observed that both the masses and the hadronic properties of ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons can fairly well be reproduced by taking just a single @xmath7-state ho wave function given by @xmath8 in these calculations , the choice of the gaussian parameter @xmath9 has been obtained by the variational principle for the qcd motivated hamiltonian including the coulomb plus confining potential . in this paper , we adopt this model  @xcite and extend it to the radially excited states for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark sector where the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cq can be taken equal , @xmath10 . the necessity of cq dirac and pauli form factors was also confirmed in our analysis of both ground state and excited states .",

    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "first , we chose the quark mass @xmath36 as an input parameter assuming @xmath10 .",
    "for both ho and linear potentials , we tried reasonable cq masses in the range @xmath81 .",
    "the potential parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 were chosen to provide an optimal fit for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath3 and @xmath87 .",
    "then , we predicted the meson masses for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ t : mass_spectrum ] .",
    "as one can see , the results for a wide range of the cq mass @xmath38 are within the experimental limits of the mass spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the results of ho and linear potential is quite small once the best fit parameters are chosen .",
    "note that the identity of the higher resonances is not completely clear yet  @xcite .",
    "while there are some experimental evidences for rho meson with mass @xmath90 , there is also a reported resonance at @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , @xmath92 might be a @xmath12-hybrid mixture .",
    "further consideration should be made to see if our simple model may or may not be suitable to reproduce these higher resonances .",
    "we have also examined the gaussian smearing function to weaken the singularity of the delta function in the hyperfine interaction @xmath93 it turns out , however , that the smearing effect is negligible in our model calculations and the well known value of @xmath94  @xcite did not change our results appreciably .    the radial wave function in eq .",
    "( [ e : phi_1 ] ) has been used successfully to approximate the ground state wave function in a couple of papers as mentioned above . in order to make sure if the first and second excited states can be well approximated with eqs .",
    "( [ e : phi_2 ] ) and ( [ e : phi_3 ] ) , we varied the wave function of the first excited state to the mixed wave function @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote the second and third ho states .",

    "( [ e : phi_2 ] ) and ( [ e : phi_3 ] ) is well justified .",
    "while all the parameter sets summarized in table  [ t : mass_spectrum ] give a good agreement with the mass spectrum , the pion decay constant is rather sensitive to the choice of @xmath38 . following the lc approach of  @xcite for the pion decay constant given by @xmath104 one",
    "gets @xmath105 as shown in table  [ t : mass_spectrum ] , the calculated value of @xmath106 for @xmath107 and the ho potential is in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath108 from  @xcite .",

    "especially , the gerasimov sum - rule calculation  @xcite indicates that the cq should be treated as extended particles .",
    "thus , we introduced dirac and pauli form factors on the level of cq .",
    "in fact , the gaussian parameter @xmath109 of our parametrization is somewhat larger than that of other calculations  @xcite where @xmath9 is generally in the range @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , it seems important to take into account these cq form factors in order to obtain comparable results with the experimental data for the hadronic properties .",
