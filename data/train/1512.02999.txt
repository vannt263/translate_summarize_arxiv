    "the dynamics of compact gravitating objects out of equilibrium has always been a topic of much interest in astrophysics .",
    "physical systems that fall under this subject include supernovae , `` failed '' supernovae such as hypernovae or collapsars , gamma - ray burst ( grb ) progenitors , coalescing binary neutron star ( ns ) systems , accreting compact stars , and nss that undergo sudden phase transitions , to name only a few . in the case of a core collapse supernova ,",
    "a ns may form and undergo additional evolution .",
    "for instance , the outwardly - moving shock wave of matter from the supernova may stall and collapse onto the nascent neutron core @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the ns is in a binary system with a less compact companion star , accretion from the companion may push the ns over its chandrasekhar limit . in either of these cases ,",
    "the resultant non - equilibrium system will most likely undergo a hydrodynamic implosion that will often result in black hole formation .    here",
    "we wish to present work that sets such excited nss in the context of critical phenomena in general relativity .",
    "specifically , we wish to investigate 1 ) the criteria required to initiate black hole formation , the boundary between black hole forming scenarios and those that do not form black holes , and 2 ) the dynamical behavior of the systems in general .",
    "this work is one of only several to date that ties critical phenomena to astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "we are certainly not the first to study numerical evolutions of ns models far from equilibrium .",
    "for example , shapiro and teukolsky @xcite asked whether a stable ns with a mass below the chandrasekhar mass could be driven to collapse by compression . with a mixed euler - lagrangian code , they began to answer the question by studying stable stars whose density profiles had been `` inflated '' in a self - similar manner such that the stars became larger and more massive . due to insufficient central pressure , such configurations were no longer equilibrium solutions and inevitably collapsed . by increasing the degree to which the equilibrium stars were inflated ,",
    "they were able to supply more kinetic energy to the system .",
    "they found that black holes formed only for stars with masses greater than the maximum equilibrium mass .",
    "in addition , shapiro and teukolsky studied accretion induced collapse , where it was again found that collapse to a black hole occurred only when the total mass of the system  in this case the mass of the star _ and",
    "_ the mass of the accreting matter  was above the maximum stable mass .",
    "both examples seemed to suggest that even driven stars needed to have masses above the maximum stable mass in order to produce black holes .",
    "moreover , they only witnessed three types of outcomes : 1 ) homologous bounce , wherein the entire star underwent a bounce after imploding to maximum compression ; 2 ) non - homologous bounce where less than @xmath2 of the matter followed a bounce sequence ; and 3 ) direct collapse to a black hole . also , baumgarte et al .",
    "@xcite using a lagrangian code based on the formulation of hernandez and misner @xcite qualitatively confirmed these results .    in order to investigate the question posed by shapiro and teukolsky further , gourgoulhon @xcite used pseudo - spectral methods and realistic , tabulated equations of state to characterize the various ways in which a ns may collapse when given an _",
    "ad hoc _ , polynomial velocity profile .",
    "such velocity profiles mimic those seen in core collapse simulations as described in @xcite . given a sufficiently large amplitude of the profile",
    ", gourgoulhon was able to form black holes from stable stars with masses well below the maximum .",
    "he was also able to observe bounces off the inner core , but was unable to continue the evolution significantly past the formation of the shock since spectral techniques typically behave poorly for discontinuous solutions .    to further explore this problem and resolve the shocks more accurately",
    ", novak @xcite used a eulerian code with high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) methods .",
    "in addition , he surveyed the parameter space in the black hole - forming regime in much greater detail than previous studies , illuminating a new scenario in which a black hole may form on the same dynamical time - scale as the bounce .",
    "depending on the amplitude of the velocity perturbation , such cases can lead to black holes that have smaller masses than their progenitor stars .",
    "this dependence suggested that masses of black holes generated by ns collapse might not be constrained by the masses of their parents and , consequently , could  in principle  allow the black hole mass , @xmath3 , to take on a continuum of values .",
    "in addition , in accordance with the study described in @xcite , novak found that the initial star did not have to be more massive than the maximum mass in order to evolve to a black hole .",
    "in fact , he found that for two equations of state  the typical polytropic equation of state ( eos ) and a realistic eos described in @xcite  arbitrarily small black holes could be made by tuning the initial amplitude of the velocity profile about the value at which black holes are first seen .",
    "hence , novak s work suggests that black holes born from nss are able to have masses in the range @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "this suggests that critical phenomena may play a role in the black hole mass function of driven nss .",
    "critical phenomena in general relativity involves the study of the solutions  called _ critical _ solutions  that lie at the boundary between black hole - forming and black hole - lacking spacetimes ( for reviews please see @xcite ) .",
    "general relativistic critical phenomena began with a detailed numerical investigation of the dynamics of a minimally coupled , massless scalar field in spherical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this first study identified three fundamental features of the critical behavior : 1 ) universality and 2 ) scale invariance of a critical solution that arises at threshold , with 3 ) power - law scaling behavior in the vicinity of threshold .",
    "all three of these have now been seen in a multitude of collapse models with a wide variety of matter sources , including perfect fluids  @xcite , an  @xmath6 yang - mills model  @xcite , and collisionless matter @xcite to cite just a few .",
    "it was eventually found that there are two related yet distinct types of critical phenomena , dubbed type  i and type  ii , due to similarities between the critical phenomena observed in gravitational collapse , and those familiar from statistical mechanics .",
    "type  ii behavior entails critical solutions that are either continuously self - similar ( css ) or discretely self - similar ( dss ) .",
    "supercritical solutions  those that form black holes  give rise to black holes with masses , @xmath7 , that scale as a power - law , @xmath8 implying that arbitrarily small black holes can be formed .",
    "here , @xmath9 parameterizes a @xmath1-parameter family of initial data with which one can tune toward the critical solution , located at @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the scaling exponent of the critical behavior .",
    "since @xmath12 is , loosely speaking , continuous across @xmath10 , this type of critical behavior was named `` type  ii '' since it parallels type  ii ( continuous ) phase transitions in statistical mechanics .    as in the statistical mechanical case",
    ", there is a type  i behavior , where the black hole mass `` turns on '' at a finite value .",
    "type  i critical solutions are quite different from their type  ii counterparts , tending to be metastable star - like solutions that are either static or periodic",
    ". the critical solutions can therefore be described by a continuous or discrete symmetry in time , analogous to the type  ii css and dss solutions . unlike the type  ii case , however , the black hole masses of supercritical solutions do not follow a power - law scaling . instead , the span of time , @xmath13as measured by an observer at the origin  that a given solution is close to the critical solution scales with the solution s deviation in parameter space from criticality @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scaling exponent of type  i behavior .",
    "we note that many of the features of critical gravitational collapse can be understood in a manner that also has a clear parallel in statistical mechanical critical phenomena . in particular , the critical solutions that have been identified to date , although unstable , tend to be minimally so in the sense that they have only a single unstable mode in perturbation theory  @xcite . the lyapunov exponent associated with this mode",
    "can then be directly related to the lifetime - scaling exponent , @xmath15 , for type i solutions , and to the mass - scaling exponent , @xmath11 , for type ii solutions .    in collapse models that involve matter characterized by one or more intrinsic length scales ,",
    "the possibility of both types of critical behavior arises .",
    "indeed , the boundary separating the two types has been studied extensively in the su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills model @xcite as well as the einstein - klein - gordon system @xcite .",
    "in the latter case it was found that when the length scale @xmath16which characterized the `` spatial extent '' of a 2-parameter family of initial data  was small compared to the scale set by the massive scalar field , type  ii behavior was observed .",
    "the transition from type  ii to type  i behavior was calculated for different families and was found to occur when @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the ( particle ) mass of the scalar field .",
    "two studies particularly close in spirit to our current work are due to hawley and choptuik @xcite and lai and choptuik  @xcite . instead of perturbing tov solutions @xcite",
    ", these authors perturbed stable , spherically symmetric , boson stars .",
    "boson stars are self - gravitating configurations of a complex scalar field with some prescribed self - interaction ( possibly just a mass term ) , whose only time - dependence is a phase that varies linearly with time ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . for a given self - interaction ,",
    "one can generically construct one - parameter families of boson stars , where the family parameter can conveniently be taken to be the central modulus , @xmath19 , of the complex field , and which plays the role of the central rest - mass density in tov solutions . as with their hydrostatic counterparts ( discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : init - star - solut ] ) , when the total mass , @xmath20 , of the configurations is plotted as a function of @xmath19 , one typically finds a maximum mass for some @xmath21 which signals a change in dynamical stability : stars with @xmath22 are stable , while those with @xmath23 are unstable .",
    "additionally , for any family of boson stars , there is generally a branch of unstable stars  with @xmath19 ranging from @xmath24 to the next value where the mass function is a local minimum  that have precisely one unstable mode in perturbation theory .",
    "these stars are thus candidates to be type i critical solutions in a collapse scenario .",
    "hawley and choptuik perturbed a boson star by collapsing a spherical pulse of massless scalar field onto it from a distance sufficient to ensure that the two matter distributions were initially non - overlapping .",
    "as such a pulse collapses through the origin , the energy distributions associated with the two matter fields interact solely through the gravitational field . for sufficiently large amplitudes of the scalar field ,",
    "the resulting increase in curvature within the star is enough to significantly compress it , ultimately resulting in either black hole formation or a star that executes a sequence of oscillations , often of large amplitude . by tuning the initial amplitude of the scalar field , type",
    "i critical solutions were found and , per the above observation , were identified as ( perturbed ) one - mode unstable boson star configurations .",
    "it was verified that the lifetimes of near - critical evolutions scaled according to  ( [ type - i - scaling ] ) , and that in each case the scaling exponent , @xmath15 , was consistent with the inverse of the real part of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath25 , of the critical solution .",
    "furthermore , values of @xmath25 were independently calculated for several cases by applying linear perturbation theory to the static boson star backgrounds , and were shown to be in good agreement with those measured from the fully dynamical calculations . finally , since boson stars model many of the characteristics of tov solutions , it was conjectured that the observed critical behavior would carry over to the fluid case .",
    "we note that in the results reported in  @xcite the end state of marginally subcritical collapse was _ not _ identified as a periodic spacetime ( i.e.  a perturbed boson star ) ; rather , it was assumed that the stars would disperse to spatial infinity in such cases . upon evolving subcritical configurations for longer physical times ,",
    "lai and choptuik @xcite  in work performed simultaneously to that of @xcite  found that the end states were , in fact , gravitationally bound and oscillatory .",
    "these results were subsequently verified by hawley @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in both studies it was found that during the non - trivial gravitational interaction of the massless scalar field and the boson star there was a transfer of mass - energy from the massless scalar field to the complex scalar field , resulting in an increase of the gravitating mass of the boson star .",
    "returning now to the fluid case , siebel et al .",
    "@xcite sought to measure the maximum ns mass allowed by the presence of a perturbing pulse of minimally - coupled , massless scalar field .",
    "a general relativistic hydrodynamic code using a characteristic formulation was used to investigate the spherically symmetric system . however , instead of varying the massless scalar field they studied five distinct star solutions having a range of central densities that straddled the threshold of black hole formation .",
    "they found that the perturbation either led to a black hole or to oscillations of the star about its initial configuration .",
    "further , in order to test their new 3-dimensional general relativistic fluid code , font et al .",
    "@xcite dynamically calculated the fundamental and harmonic mode frequencies of spherical tov solutions .",
    "they observed the transition of a tov solution on the _ unstable _ branch to the stable branch by evolving an unstable solution that was perturbed at the truncation error level .",
    "the unstable star overshot and then oscillated about the stable solution , contradicting a common assumption in the field that stars from the unstable branch always formed black holes .",
    "evolving from initial conditions consisting of an unstable tov star has continued to be used for code - testing purposes  @xcite . in @xcite liebling et al .",
    "performed a similar study with weakly magnetized unstable tov solutions in 3-d , but employed explicit and tunable perturbations to the pressure and density .",
    "they , too , found evidence for type  i behavior , though were unable to tune sufficiently close to the threshold to demonstrate the expected scaling behavior .",
    "all the different kinds of perturbations they employed drove the system to the same , seemingly _",
    "universal _ solution .",
    "proximity to the critical threshold was improved in @xcite , wherein they perturbed axisymmetric unstable tov stars by truncation error and a small ingoing velocity distribution , while tuning with the central density of the star .",
    "apart from the work presented here ( and here  @xcite ) , the most exhaustive explorations of type  i behavior involving nss are that of jin and suen  @xcite , wan et al .",
    "@xcite , and kellerman , radice , and rezzolla  @xcite .",
    "the results presented in these papers indicated that the head - on axisymmetric collision of two nss can be tuned with a variety of initial data parameters to a critical threshold that bifurcates end states involving either a single black hole or a single more massive oscillating ns .",
    "universality of the critical behavior was supported by tuning separately the initial magnitude of the stellar velocities , central densities and adiabatic index of their polytropic eos .",
    "threshold solutions were found to high precision for all three of the tuning variables .",
    "all threshold solutions were found to be perturbed tov solutions on the unstable branch , no matter the tuning parameter . since changes in the adiabatic index may mimic the effects of cooling and accretion , an interesting conjecture was made that critical behavior might be realizable without the need for fine tuning @xcite .",
    "further , frequencies at which the near - threshold solution oscillated were measured and found to differ  by one to two orders of magnitude  from the frequencies of the @xmath26 perturbation modes about the _ initial stable _ tov solution @xcite .",
    "the seeming discrepancy in frequencies was eventually explained by @xcite when they demonstrated that the near - threshold solutions were perturbed tov solutions on the unstable branch , and that the oscillations occurred at the fundamental mode of the unstable tov solution  not the original stable tov solution .",
    "this realization in the literature paralleled conclusions made years before in the boson star context @xcite , and in the tov context @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate both types of critical behavior using a perfect fluid model , although we focus for the most part on the type  i case .",
    "for the first time with tov solutions , we demonstrate that the scaling exponent , @xmath15 , is consistent with the inverse of the real part of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath25 , of the critical solution .",
    "this provides further evidence to support the notion that the type  i critical solutions are perturbed tov solutions on the unstable branch .",
    "the initial conditions which we adjust entail a stable tov star with the stiffest causal polytropic eos ( @xmath27 ) , plus some sort of `` perturbing agent . ''",
    "the methods by which we drive a star to a non - equilibrium state involve : 1 ) giving the star an initially ingoing velocity profile , and 2 ) collapsing a spherical shell of scalar field onto it .",
    "neither method can be considered truly perturbative since both can drive the star to total obliteration or prompt collapse to a black hole , but we use this term since a better one is lacking .    sec .",

    "[ sec : veloc - induc - neutr ] , we begin our study of stellar collapse by extensively covering the parameter space of initial conditions for velocity - perturbed stars .",
    "the results from this section provide a broad view of the range of dynamical scenarios one can expect in the catastrophic collapse of nss .",
    "we then employ this knowledge in our examination of the solutions that lie on the verge of black hole formation .",
    "both type  i and type  ii solutions are found . the stars type  i critical behavior is explored in sec .  [ sec : type - i - critical ] ( their type  ii behavior has been investigated in a related paper @xcite ) .",
    "the threshold solutions we calculate from the type  i study are then compared to unstable tov solutions .",
    "in addition , for the first time , a parameter - space boundary separating the two types of phenomena is identified and discussed . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : concl - future - work ] with some closing remarks and notes on possible future work .",
    "the equations and methods employed in this study closely follow those used in @xcite .",
    "the primary difference is that we sometimes use a massless scalar field that is minimally coupled to gravity , and hence to the fluid .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details regarding the evolution of the hydrodynamics equations , but give here the equations that describe this `` fluid+scalar '' system and the methods used to evolve the scalar field .",
    "we largely follow the notation established in our previous paper on type ii collapse of a perfect fluid  @xcite .",

    "penetrate apparent horizons , but that the formation of a black hole in a given calculation is nonetheless signaled by @xmath47 , for some specific radial coordinate , @xmath48 .",
    "we model ns matter as a perfect fluid .",
    "modern conservative methods that utilize the characteristic structure of the fluid equations of motion expressed in _ conservative _ form have been very successful in evolving highly - relativistic flows in the presence of strong gravitational fields ( see @xcite for a small but representative selection of papers on this topic ) , and we follow that approach here . in particular , we use a formulation used by romero et al .",
    "@xcite and a change of variables similar to that performed by neilsen and choptuik @xcite .",
    "one way in which we drive ns models to collapse entails the inclusion of a massless scalar field which dynamically perturbs the star .",
    "we also use a driving mechanism that involves no scalar field .",
    "not surprisingly , it turns out that the equations governing the geometry and fluid equations in the `` fluid - only '' system can be recovered from those in the `` fluid+scalar '' system simply by setting the scalar field , @xmath49 , to zero for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "hence , our numerical implementation always uses the full `` fluid+scalar '' equations for determining fluid and geometric fields : if we wish to include the scalar field , we simply initialize it to a non - zero value and evolve it in tandem with the fluid .",
    "thus , by stating the fluid equations of motion ( eom ) for the `` fluid+scalar '' system , we are also simultaneously  yet indirectly  stating them in the `` fluid - only '' system .",
    "the eom for the two matter sources are derived , in part , from the local conservation of energy @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the _ total _ stress - energy tensor .",

    "consequently , the time step is too small to allow for longtime evolutions of these dispersal cases , and we are unable to guarantee that they do indeed disperse to infinity . in addition , the self - similar portion of these marginally subcritical solutions entails only a small amount of the original star s matter , the remainder of which could , in principle , collapse into a black hole at a time after the inner self - similar component departs from the origin . hence , with our current code , it is difficult to determine the ultimate fate of these dispersal scenarios .",
    "what does this parameter survey suggest about the black hole mass function from driven ns collapse ? for pc scenarios , the black hole mass is approximately the same as the progenitor star s mass .",

    "if the perturbation is weak , then the star will undergo oscillations with its fundamental frequency after the scalar field disperses through the origin and finally escapes to null infinity ( higher harmonics are also excited ) . on the other hand , when the initial scalar shell is of sufficiently large amplitude , the star can be driven to prompt collapse , trapping some of the scalar field along with the entire star in a black hole . somewhere in between , the scalar field can compactify the star to a nearly static state that resembles an unstable tov solution of slightly increased mass .",

    "further , we do find a few instances where the star s matter is still trapped even after the shock and bounce , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbc - bound ] .",
    "that is , the external matter bounces from the denser core , forms a shock and propagates outwards , but a portion of this matter eventually falls back onto the black hole .",
    "the fact that @xmath120 decreases and @xmath278 becomes ingoing after the bounce suggests that the outer parts of the star do indeed accrete onto the collapsing interior .",
    "this example demonstrates that not all sbc scenarios result in black holes that are less massive than their progenitors , and that the final mass of the black hole is most likely continuous across the sbc / pc boundary .    ) , velocity at @xmath120 ( @xmath278 ) , relative stellar mass deviation from initial time ( @xmath280 ) , and central density for a sbc star .",
    "the evolution was stopped when the maximum value of @xmath182 obtained a value of @xmath306 , at which point the mass of black hole was calculated to be about @xmath307 and the minimum of @xmath41 was @xmath308 .",
    "the defining parameters for this run are @xmath309 , @xmath310 , and @xmath311 .",
    "[ fig : sbc - bound ] ]    for less compact stars , it is natural to justify the existence of the transition between sbd to sbo scenarios . if we follow evolutions of a particular star ",
    "say one with @xmath312 for various @xmath131 , we see that the initial velocity perturbation results in dispersal of more and more of the stellar material as @xmath131 increases .",
    "the central densities and masses of the resultant sbo stars decrease as the sbo / sbd boundary is reached , implying that the transition is continuous .",
    "for instance , if @xmath313 and @xmath314 are the final central density and mass , respectively , of the product star , then we should see that @xmath315 as @xmath316 , where @xmath317 is the threshold value of @xmath131 that separates the sbo and sbd states .",
    "we have found that this seems to be the case since after tuning @xmath318 to an approximate precision of @xmath319 , @xmath320which is about an @xmath321 decrease in central density .",
    "alternatively , we cross the threshold by varying @xmath118 and keeping @xmath131 constant . that is , if we choose a specific @xmath131 and start perturbing stars with larger @xmath118 , we see that  as the stars become less compact  the velocity distribution is able to expel more and more matter from the central core . in turn ,",
    "smaller and smaller stars will form for a given @xmath131 as @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is the value of @xmath118 at the sbo / sbd boundary for a given value of @xmath131",
    ". it would be interesting to calculate the scaling behavior of @xmath314 as a function of @xmath324 or @xmath325 .",
    "an accurate calculation of this scaling law would require many runs in this regime , which is one of the most computational intensive regimes . in this limit",
    ", we would have to resolve a wide range of scales in order to evolve the initial dynamics of the compact progenitor star through to it settling into a new equilibrium .",
    "such calculations might require a full - fledged adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code , which we leave for future work .",
    "in order to gather a better understanding of what causes the near critical solutions to temporarily depart from the unstable branch , we tuned to the critical solution using different values of various control parameters .",
    "for instance , to see if the presence of the departures is affected by the floor , we tuned to the critical solution for three different values of @xmath326 .",
    "the most marginally subcritical solutions from these searches are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoc - floor ] .",
    "in addition , the effect of changing the outer boundary s location , @xmath327 is seen in fig .  [ fig : rhoc - rmax ] . to see if the time at which the pulse collides with the star has any effect , the initial position of the pulse , @xmath328 was varied ; the results from this particular analysis",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoc - r0pp ] .     for the marginally subcritical solutions obtained when using varying values of the fluid s floor .",
    "the original , reference solution ( solid curve ) used @xmath329 , while the other two lines used floor values @xmath304 ( dotted line ) and and @xmath330 ( dashed line ) times greater .",
    "variations can be seen between the three solutions , even though the smallest discrepancies are between the two solutions with the largest floor values .",
    "all runs shown here used @xmath331 .",
    "[ fig : rhoc - floor ] ]      in general , we see all these aspects to have significant and non - trivial effect on the threshold solution s departure from the unstable solution .",
    "but , all the different marginally - subcritical solutions finally depart from the unstable solution at approximately the same time and all cases share the same scaling exponent .    .",
    "specifically , the scalar field at @xmath129 takes the form of a gaussian distribution , and the position of the center of this gaussian is unique for each curve shown here . in our units",
    "the radius of the progenitor star was @xmath332 , while the initial positions of the scalar field pulses were at @xmath333 ( dots ) , @xmath175 ( solid curve ) , @xmath334 ( short dashes ) , @xmath335 ( long dashes ) .",
    "all runs shown here used @xmath336 . [",
    "fig : rhoc - r0pp ] ]    whether because of its magnitude or extent , the solution s departure seems to be affected by the floor .",
    "increasing the size of the floor seems to hasten the initial departure ; even though they represent only two points of reference , the similarity of the solutions with the two highest floor values may suggest that the floor s effect `` converges '' to one behavior as its size increases . on the other hand ,",
    "changes in the size of the computational domain and @xmath328 seem to have no _ consistent _ effect on the first departure time .",
    "the most likely explanation is that excited modes from the the artificial atmosphere surrounding the star instigate the departures .",
    "the unstable solutions to which the near critical solutions emulate are @xmath1-mode unstable tov solutions , and tov solutions do not involve an atmosphere .",
    "since these additional modes have no effect on the scaling exponent and only periodically affect the evolution of the threshold solutions , they must be transient and stable .",
    "their little influence is consistent with the idea that they come from the atmosphere since it is hydrodynamically and gravitationally insignificant compared to the star .",
    "further work will need to be done in order to definitively understand the cause of the departures .    similar studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have not reported encountering similar phenomena .",
    "it remains to be seen whether it is because their investigations involved different neutron star solutions ( e.g. , different values of @xmath109 as in @xcite , or rotating and magnetized unstable - branch neutron stars as in @xcite ) , different numerical schemes , or something else altogether .",
