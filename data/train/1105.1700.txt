    "when dealing with measurements on complex systems it is typically difficult to find the optimal set of variables to describe their evolution , which provides the best opportunities for understanding and predicting the system s behavior .",
    "recently a framework for analyzing measurements on stochastic systems was introduced @xcite .",
    "this framework is based on the assumption that the measured properties evolve according to a deterministic drift and stochastic fluctuations due to the interactions with the internal degrees of freedom or the environment .",
    "these fluctuations are globally ruled by some specific stochastic forcing inherent to the signal evolution itself , and therefore can not be separated from the measured variables . whether they are due to quantum uncertainties or a limited knowledge of the state of the system , they are fundamental for a complete description of a complex system .",
    "several works in this scope have already shown the advantage of this approach , ranging from the description of turbulent flows @xcite and climate indices @xcite to the evolution of stock markets @xcite and oil prices @xcite , just to mention some .",
    "in the course of time several improvements to the method were proposed concerning its robustness with respect to finite sampling effects and measurement noise @xcite .",
    "however , a natural question arises when dealing simultaneously with several variables : is it possible to find non - trivial functions of measured properties for which the stochastic fluctuation can be neglected ?",
    "this would mean that it should be possible to decrease the number of stochastic variables needed to describe the system .",
    "in this paper we will follow this question up in detail and show , that by accessing the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrices comprehending the measured properties it is possible to derive a path in phase space through which the deterministic contribution is enhanced . as a direct application",
    ", our procedure allows for the determination of the number of independent sources of stochastic forcing in a system described by an arbitrarily large number of properties .",
    "a pictorial example is as follows .",
    "consider a professional archer trying to aim at a target in a succession of shots .",
    "if the archer holds the bow without any support , one expects that the set of trials is distributed around the center according to a radially symmetric gaussian .",
    "hence deviations have the same amplitudes in all directions . however ,",
    "if the archer lies on the floor , the vertical direction will be more confined than the horizontal . in this case",
    "we expect a smaller variance of deviations in the vertical direction than in the horizontal one . if the archer lies on an inclined plane the most confined and less confined directions will have a certain slope related to the plane inclination .",
    "regarding the variance in space as a particular representation of the diffusion matrix , we can now think in more complex systems where at each point in phase space fluctuations can be defined through their local diffusion matrices .",
    "the study of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors is the scope of the present paper .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] by defining our system of variables mathematically and by describing the standard approach to estimate its dynamics from measured data as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a particular emphasis will be given to the diffusive terms .",
    "then the general eigenvalue problem is introduced in the role of the local eigenvalues of diffusion matrices are discussed , which exhibits the framework for the present work .",
    "we show that at each point of phase space the eigenvectors of the diffusion matrix are tangent to new coordinate lines , one of them corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue , thus indicating the direction towards which fluctuations are - at least partially - suppressed . in sec .",

    "notice that the diffusion matrix is symmetric ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2d ] ) ) and therefore @xmath105 . the surfaces obtained numerically are fitted to a full quadratic polynomial in @xmath94 and @xmath95 through a least square procedure .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomial fits are also shown in fig.[fig4]a - c .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig4]a - c comply with the analytical expression in eq .",

    "[ fig4]d - e .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists the values obtained for the coefficients of the surface fits in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that the aforementioned procedure can likewise be applied to measured multi - dimensional time series in cases where no additional information on the underlying dynamics is available . in this case",
    "the corresponding fields of eigenvectors indicate the directions with largest and smallest stochastic contributions . using this information , a transform of variables to a coordinate system aligned with the direction of the smallest stochastic contribution",
    "can be applied , which in the present case would be the tangential direction . in the representation of these new coordinates , the stochastic contribution",
    "will then be reduced .    in the previous case ,",
    "the two eigenvectors for diffusion were introduced tangentially and perpendicularly to the limit cycle .",
    "if the principal axes for the stochastic contribution are not aligned with the trajectories of the deterministic part of the system , one might suspect an interplay between both stochastic contribution and the drift of the system .    in order to demonstrate the wider applicability of our method , we next consider such a case , with the major axis aligned with @xmath95-direction .",

    "in other words , the impact of stochastic fluctuations is large in the @xmath95-direction and small along the @xmath94-axis .",

    "fig5]c ) .",
    "interestingly , in both cases presented above , our analysis estimates better the diffusion matrix than the corresponding drift vector , contrary to what is known in other situations @xcite .",
    "the reason for the poor quality of the drift estimate is probably due to the small time increment used for the estimate , which spoils particularly the result for the drift .",

    "with these two examples we first have illustrated that our numerical approach succeeds in estimating the drift and the diffusion functions contributions in a two - dimensional stochastic system .",
    "a straightforward computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the diffusion matrices then enables us to ascertain a set of principal stochastic directions .",
    "we would like to note that the method described here bears some resemblance to the well - known principal component analysis@xcite .",
    "in contrast to principal component analysis performed on the distribution of the measured data the method we propose , however , focuses on the stochastic _",

    "the properties of these fluctuations in general are dependent on the position @xmath116 resulting in vector fields of the principal axes of the stochastic contributions to the dynamics of the system of consideration .",
    "the two methods seem however related and should provide complementary insights when applied to specific sets of empirical data .",
    "such matters are beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "we also emphasize that the minimal eigenvalue of the diffusion matrix not necessarily points towards the direction the systems as a whole can be expected to evolve to .",
    "it rather reflects the direction of minimal stochastic forcing only . for prediction of the system s evolution in general time",
    "propagators need to be taken into account which involve both the stochastic ( diffusion ) and the deterministic ( drift ) parts of the dynamics @xcite . nevertheless , being able to ascertain the directions in phase space where fluctuations are weaker enables one to choose a transformation such that part of the new variables have small stochastic terms , reducing the number of variables which are affected by stochastic forces .",
    "further , this is also of physical interest to see in which variables noise is acting , for example to which variable a thermal bath is physically connected , and it may be of technical interest to better detect a noise source , for example in an electric circuit@xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduce the concept of eigendirections for the stochastic dynamics in systems of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the procedure builds on the modeling of complex systems by means of drift an diffusion functions , that specify a system of coupled langevin equations .",
    "estimates for these functions can be obtained directly from measurements on the systems without prior knowledge on its dynamics following an approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in langevin systems the stochastic",
    "forcing is composed of independent gaussian @xmath63-correlated stochastic fluctuations . the way how these fluctuations effect the system depends both on the diffusion matrix and on the coordinate system chosen .",
    "whereas in former publications much attention has been paid to imperfections of the langevin process , like measurement noise or correlated noise and finite size sampling@xcite here we introduced a method which allows us to determine the eigendirections along which each stochastic force acts .",
    "each direction of forcing is defined through the eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue accounting for its amplitude .",
    "the set of eigenvectors does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system and is therefore characteristic for the system .",
    "further , for the particular case where a number @xmath117 of eigenvalues are negligible in comparison with the others at each mesh point , the number of stochastic variables can be reduced . even in cases where the number of stochastic variables can not be reduced ,",
    "the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalues at each point in phase space indicates the path with minimal stochastic forcing . in any case",
    "a transform to new coordinates in the directions of minimum stochastic forcing can be performed , increasing the relative amplitude of the deterministic components and the predictability of the corresponding variable .",
    "the method was successfully applied to a two - dimensional system exhibiting a hopf - bifurcation . for the hopf - bifurcation",
