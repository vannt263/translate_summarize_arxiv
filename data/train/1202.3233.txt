    "after almost two decades of design and construction , the lhc accelerator  @xcite started operation at the end of 2009 with proton - proton ( pp ) collisions at 0.9 and 2.36 tev centre - of - mass energy , reaching its current top energy of @xmath0 tev in 2010 .",
    "heavy ion collisions ( a+a ) are an integral part of the lhc physics program .",
    "the first four - week run with pb beams took place in november 2010 at a centre - of - mass energy of 2.76 tev per nucleon .",
    "about @xmath1 of integrated luminosity were delivered to each of the three lhc experiments which take part in the heavy ion program , the two general purpose detectors atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite as well as the dedicated heavy ion detector alice  @xcite .",
    "this review summarises the results from the first year of ion physics at the lhc , focusing on global event properties , high @xmath2  and heavy quark physics , and the production of hidden heavy flavour mesons ( j/@xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions make it possible to study the properties of strongly interacting matter at energy densities far above those of normal nuclear matter .",
    "general arguments based on the property of asymptotic freedom suggest , and quantitative calculations of lattice quantum chromodynamics confirm @xcite , that qcd matter undergoes a transition from a hadronic gas to a quark - gluon plasma at a temperature @xmath5 mev , corresponding to an energy density of @xmath6 gev/@xmath7 . at small net baryon density ,",
    "the transition is a smooth cross - over spanning a temperature range of @xmath8 mev , which means that the precise value of the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath9 depends on the observable used to locate it .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma phase is characterized by a much reduced condensate of light quarks , reflecting the approximate restoration of chiral symmetry , and by screening of the chromo - electric force between heavy quarks , implying the absence of quark confinement . at high net baryon density ,",
    "the confined and deconfined phases are thought to be separated by a first - order phase transition , beginning with a critical point whose position is not accurately known .",
    "a large body of experimental and theoretical research conducted over the past decades at ags , sps , and rhic has led to the following `` standard model '' of heavy ion collisions at collider energies @xcite .",
    "the energy deposited in the mid - rapidity kinematic range is controlled by the density of gluons contained in the colliding nuclei at moderately small values of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath10 @xcite . at top rhic collision energy",
    "the relevant range is @xmath11 , while at the current lhc energy the value is @xmath12 . in this range of @xmath10",
    "the gluon density obeys a highly nonlinear evolution equation that describes the saturation of the rapidly growing perturbative gluon distribution at low virtuality @xcite .",
    "the virtuality scale at which this saturation occurs is called the saturation scale @xmath13 . at present collider energies and for heavy nuclei @xmath14 gev@xmath15 at rhic and @xmath16",
    "gev@xmath15 at lhc @xcite .",
    "the liberation of the dense gluon sea by interactions during the collision of two nuclei is thought to result in the formation of a dense , non - thermal qcd plasma with highly occupied gauge field modes , often called a `` glasma '' @xcite .",
    "the glasma thermalizes rapidly through nonlinear interactions including plasma instabilities @xcite . during the longest phase of the heavy ion reaction the qcd matter forms a nearly thermal quark - gluon plasma , whose evolution can be described accurately by relativistic viscous hydrodynamics because of its very small kinematic shear viscosity .",
    "the temperature of the plasma at the time of thermalization is approximately @xmath17 ; it cools by mainly longitudinal expansion until it converts to a gas of hadron resonances when its temperature falls below @xmath9 . at that temperature the chemical composition of the produced hadrons gets frozen , but the spectral distribution of the hadrons is still modified by final - state interactions , which are modelled by a boltzmann transport equation .    the very small dimensionless ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath18 to the entropy density @xmath19 of the qcd matter produced in heavy ion collisions ( @xmath20  @xcite ) was one of the main discoveries of the experimental program at rhic @xcite .",
    "such a small ratio requires that the interactions among the constituent quanta are extremely strong and the cross sections among them approach the unitarity limit @xcite .",
    "this picture is supported by qcd lattice simulations , which show that the qcd matter in the temperature range @xmath21 is highly nonperturbative as witnessed , e.  g. , by the large value of the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the strongly coupled nature of the quark - gluon plasma created in the heavy ion reaction is confirmed by its ability to `` quench '' jets . at rhic ,",
    "the two main observables revealing this property are the suppression of single hadron yields at high transverse momentum @xmath2   relative to @xmath23 reactions and the additional suppression of back - to - back emission of high-@xmath2  hadrons .",
    "the ratios quantifying these suppressions are known as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "compelling arguments related the suppression effects to the ability of the quark - gluon plasma to degrade the kinetic energy of a hard parton ( quark or gluon ) traversing it , either by elastic collisions or collisions followed by gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the large values of the energy loss rate of hard partons deduced from the rhic data @xcite are consistent with the low shear viscosity deduced from the collective flow pattern of low - momentum hadrons @xcite .    before the lhc turned on , it was not clear whether this quantitative model of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions and the properties of hot qcd matter smoothly extrapolates from rhic to the one order of magnitude higher lhc energies .",
    "questions of particular interest were whether the increase in the initial temperature of the quark - gluon plasma would result in a much more viscous expansion of the created matter , and whether the gluon saturation effects in the colliding nuclei would be so strong that they significantly reduce , not only the expected density of the glasma , but also the yield of particles at moderately large @xmath2 .",
    "because of the much higher beam energy and the large acceptance of the lhc detectors , heavy ion collisions at the lhc were also expected to provide access to new observables measuring the pattern of jet quenching and extend our knowledge of the interaction of heavy quarks and heavy quarkonia with hot qcd matter .",
    "an extensive compilation of theoretical predictions made before the commencement of the lhc heavy ion program can be found in @xcite .",
    "global event properties describe the state and dynamical evolution of the bulk matter created in a heavy ion collision by measuring characteristics of the vast majority of particles which have momenta below a few gev/@xmath26 , referred to as `` soft '' particles .",
    "they include multiplicity distributions , which can be related to the initial energy density reached during the collision , yields and momentum spectra of identified particles , which are determined by the conditions at and shortly after hadronization , and correlations between particles which measure both size and lifetime of the dense matter state as well as some of its transport properties via collective flow phenomena .      the most basic quantity , and indeed the one measured within days of the first ion collision , is the number of charged particles produced per unit of ( pseudo)rapidity , @xmath27  ( @xmath28 ) , in a central , `` head - on '' collision . when the lhc heavy ion program was conceived and detectors had to be designed more than a decade ago , predictions for @xmath28  were highly uncertain , ranging from below 1000 to above 4500 , because experimental results had to be extrapolated from light ions at low energy ( sulphur beams at @xmath29 gev ) by orders of magnitude in both ion mass and beam energy  @xcite . with results from rhic , the uncertainties where substantially reduced , with most predictions concentrating in the range @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the value finally measured at lhc , @xmath28   @xmath31  @xcite , was on the high side of this range . from the measured multiplicity",
    "one can derive a rough estimate of the energy density with the help of a formula first proposed by bjorken  @xcite relating the energy density to the transverse energy : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the thermalization time , @xmath34 is the nuclear radius , and @xmath35 gev is the transverse energy per emitted particle .",
    "the value measured at the lhc implies that the initial energy density ( at @xmath36 fm / c ) is about 15 gev/@xmath7  @xcite , approximately a factor three higher than in au+au collisions at the top energy of rhic  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding initial temperature increases by at least 30% to @xmath37 mev , even with the conservative assumption that the formation time @xmath33 , when thermal equilibrium is first established , remains the same as at rhic .",
    "the high multiplicity at lhc , together with the large experimental acceptance of the detectors , allow for a very precise determination of the collision geometry ( impact parameter and reaction plane orientation ) in each event .",
    "events are classified according to `` centrality '' , where e.g. the 0 - 5% centrality bin contains the 5% of all hadronic interaction events with the largest final - state multiplicity and therefore the smallest impact parameters .",
    "correspondingly , the 90 - 100% centrality bin comprises the 10% of events with the smallest final - state multiplicity and the largest impact parameters .",
    "the experimentally measured centrality can be related analytically or via a probabilistic glauber monte - carlo generator to the number of participating nucleons @xmath38  which are contained in the nuclear overlap volume for a given centrality class and therefore take part in the collision  @xcite .",
    "likewise one can extract the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath39  between the participants .",
    "for pb+pb at lhc , the centrality or @xmath38  resolution varies from about 0.5% for central ( @xmath38  @xmath40 ) to about 5% for peripheral ( @xmath38  @xmath41 ) events  @xcite .    [",

    "the lhc has entered the field of ultra - relativistic heavy ion physics with an impressive first year performance , having benefited from many years of preparation , a strong and very complementary set of state - of - the - art detectors , and , crucially , decades of experience and progress made at previous machines .",
    "global event properties were found to evolve smoothly from rhic to lhc , to be qualitatively similar but quantitatively different , and to reflect the expected increases in energy density , volume , and lifetime of the hot and dense matter created in the collisions .",
    "the data have generally confirmed that also at lhc energy the bulk features imply the formation of a very strongly interacting , nearly perfect quark - gluon plasma liquid .",
    "the prominent presence of various collective flow patterns has opened a path forward to precision measurements of its material properties , including shear viscosity , equation - of - state , and sound velocity .    concerning bulk properties , and with the possible exception of thermal particle production , where the unexpectedly low proton yield needs confirmation and clarification ,",
    "the standard reaction model established at rhic has proven itself to be predictive and detailed enough to permit quantitative extrapolation to much higher collision energies .    for observables where the energy reach of lhc is unique , i.  e.  low-@xmath10 parton physics and hard processes , already the first low luminosity run has revealed a wealth of significant , and at times surprising results .",
    "the energy loss of high momentum partons traveling through the matter was measured with several different particle species as well as with fully reconstructed jets .",
    "while its magnitude is roughly in the expected range , the more differential analysis of parton type and momentum dependence , dijet correlations , and energy flow around the jet axis has revealed features which were not anticipated and may spur substantial refinements of our understanding and modelling of parton interactions with the hot qcd medium .    the results on quarkonium production , where precision measurements of the @xmath4 resonances are possible at lhc , in addition to those of the charmonium states , have yet to provide decisive information on the suppression mechanism .",
    "however , intriguing hints have been found in the charmonium and bottomonium suppression pattern , suggesting significant differences to the observations at rhic .    the near future of heavy ion running at lhc will bring a significant increase in integrated luminosity  already the second heavy ion run in november 2011",
    "has increased the statistics for hard probes by more than an order of magnitude  as well as new signals like @xmath42jet and @xmath43jet correlations .",
    "the @xmath44+pb run planned for 2012 should not only deliver the much needed comparison data for the heavy ion program but also far extend the kinematic reach for the study of initial - state effects in the nuclear parton wave function , such as saturation and other low-@xmath10 physics . and another factor of two increase in energy is in sight when lhc will reach the design value after 2014 .    the combination of the on - going heavy ion program at rhic , which includes high - luminosity measurements with upgraded detectors , the new higher energy data from lhc , and the demonstrated solid foundation in theory promises rapid progress in a quantitative understanding of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma .",
