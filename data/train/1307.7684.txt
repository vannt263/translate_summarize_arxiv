    "the free energy difference can be calculated from the thermodynamic integration expression @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the kinetic energy expectation values for a hydrogen isotope of mass @xmath12 in a water molecule ho@xmath3 in the liquid and vapor phases respectively .",
    "the kinetic energy can be calculated exactly for a given potential energy model of water using a path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) simulation .",
    "these simulations exploit the exact isomorphism between a system of quantum mechanical particles and that of a set of classical ring polymers in which the spread of a polymer is directly related to that quantum particle s position uncertainty@xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy for the particle @xmath3 in the molecule ho@xmath3 can be calculated from these simulations using the centroid virial estimator @xcite @xmath13 where t is the temperature and k@xmath14 is the boltzmann constant . here ,",

    "the first term in this expression is the classical kinetic energy and is independent of the surrounding environment , thus it is identical in the vapor and liquid phase .",
    "the second term is the kinetic energy associated with confinement of a quantum particle .",
    "this confinement depends on the forces exerted on the particle by the surrounding molecules .",
    "equilibrium fractionation is thus an entirely quantum mechanical phenomenon .",
    "pimd simulations were performed using 1000 water molecules with @xmath18=32 ring polymer beads used for the imaginary time discretization . previously described evolution and thermostatting procedures were used @xcite .",
    "the computational cost of these calculations was reduced by using the ring polymer contraction technique with a cut - off of 5 , which for this system size leads to more than an order of magnitude speed - up compared to a standard pimd implementation @xcite . the integral in eq .",

    ", we used the q - spcfw @xcite and q - tip4p / f @xcite models which have previously been shown to accurately reproduce many of water s properties in pimd simulations of liquid water .",
    "both models are flexible , use point charges , and have a harmonic description of the bending mode .",
    "however , while q - spcfw uses a purely harmonic description of the oh stretch @xmath21 q - tip4p / f contains anharmonicity by modeling the stretch as a morse expansion truncated at fourth order @xmath22 .",
    "\\label{eq : aharm}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the distance between the oxygen and hydrogen atom and the parameters are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . the anharmonicity in the q - tip4p / f model makes the observed quantum mechanical effects much smaller than previously predicted from harmonic or rigid models and gave rise to the idea of `` competing quantum effects '' in water@xcite .    both models have previously been shown to accurately reproduce many of water s properties in pimd simulations of liquid water . due to their simple potential form such models are generally less transferable to other phases than more sophisticated polarizable or _ ab initio _ descriptions .",
    "however partially adiabatic centroid molecular dynamics simulations @xcite have shown that the anharmonic stretch ( eq . [ eq : aharm ] ) allows reasonable agreement to be obtained in the observed frequency shifts in the infrared spectrum in going from liquid to gaseous water as well as from pure light to pure heavy water @xcite .",
    "these models were chosen to assess the importance of anharmonicity in the oh stretch using a `` zeroth order '' description of liquid water .",
    "hence , as we show below , they offer a straightforward way to assess competing quantum effects in water .",
    "figure [ fig : graph ] shows the fractionation factors calculated from our pimd simulations compared to the experimental data of ref .",
    "for consistency with the experimental data , we plot @xmath24 which is simply @xmath25 . since @xmath26 is generally small , @xmath27 thus an experimental value at 280 k of 100 corresponds to 10% more d residing in the liquid than the vapor . above 500 k ,",
    "the experimental data shows a well characterized region of inverse fractionation where d becomes more favored in the vapor than in the liquid , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .    turning to the simulated data , we observe that the harmonic q - spc / fw model over - predicts the magnitude of fractionation at 300 k by a factor of 3 , and does not fall to the value observed experimentally at 300 k until the temperture is raised to 450 k. in contrast , the q - tip4p / f model is in error by only 25% at the lowest temperature and approaches the experimental values more closely at higher temperatures .",
    "it also correctly shows inverse fractionation above 540 k. a previous study using the rigid spc / e model and @xmath28 perturbation theory , found a h / d fractionation of 450 at 300 k which is @xmath295 times higher than that seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this was purely due to the use of a rigid model or whether the approximate @xmath28 perturbation technique used to obtain the fractionation ratios was also at fault .    while fig.[fig : graph ] demonstrates that the q - tip4p / f model provides much better agreement with the experimental data than q - spcfw , it is not immediately clear what aspect of the parameterization causes this . to better understand the origins of this effect , we constructed two models which we denote aq - spc / fw and hq - tip4p / f .",
    "in the former , the q - spc / fw water model has its harmonic oh stretch replaced by a fourth order morse expansion using the parameters of q - tip4p / f ; in the latter , the morse potential of q - tip4p / f is truncated at the harmonic term ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : harm ] and [ eq : aharm ] ) . the anharmonic variant of q - spc / fw gives results as good as q - tip4p / f , while the harmonic version of q - tip4p / f fares as poorly as q - spcfw . in other words , the accurate prediction of the fractionation ratios in liquid water",
    "is tied to the anharmonicity in the oh direction and is rather insensitive to the other parameters .",
    "this sheds light on a previous study where a sophisticated rigid polarizable model gave identical predictions for h / d fractionation to the simple fixed - charge rigid spc / e model , i.e. varying the intermolecular potential alone does not give the flexibility required to accurately reproduce the experimental fractionation ratios @xcite .    to determine the reason for the inversion observed in fractionation above 500 k in both experiment and the q - tip4p / f model , we decompose the contributions to the fractionation ratio by noting that the quantum contribution to the kinetic energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : kinetic ] is the dot product of two vectors .",
    "the overall kinetic energy is invariant to the coordinate system used to evaluate it , thus when the kinetic energy is calculated in the standard cartesian basis all three components will average to the same number due to the isotropy of the liquid . to gain further insight , we instead use the internal coordinates of the water molecule and determine the contribution to @xmath24 arising from the oh bond vector , a vector in the plane of the molecule , and the vector perpendicular to the molecular plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterbeads ] .",
    "this is similar to the approach taken by lin _ et .",
    "_ in the different context of investigating the proton momentum disitribution in ice @xcite .",
    "the results of this decomposition are shown in table [ ta : decompose_300 ] for 300 k where d is experimentally seen to favor the liquid , and table [ ta : decompose_620 ] for 620 k where d is experimentally seen to favor the vapor .    from table",
    "[ ta : decompose_300 ] , we see that all of the models have largely similar contributions from the two directions orthogonal to the oh bond and that both are positive and therefore favor the d excess in the liquid .",
    "the contribution perpendicular to the plane is noticeably larger than the contribution in the plane . as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : deltaa ] , the values depend on the change in the quantum kinetic energy between h and d in the liquid and the vapor , which in turn is determined by how much the h or d atom s position uncertainty is restricted by interacting with the other water molecules in the liquid or vapor . since in the vapor",
    "there is little confinement in plane orthogonal to the water , a larger contribution from that direction is expected ; in the liquid , other molecules are present which restrict expansion in that coordinate .    in all cases",
    "the oh contribution is negative , indicating that there is less confinement in the position of the h atom in that direction in the liquid than in the vapor because the hydrogen atom participates in hydrogen bonding allowing the oh chemical bond to stretch more easily .",
    "however , comparing the anharmonic models ( aq - spcfw and q - tip4p / f ) with their harmonic counterparts ( q - spcfw and hq - tip4p / f ) , we observe a 10 fold increase in the values arising from the oh contribution which gives rise to a larger cancellation of the positive contributions from the two orthogonal vectors .",
    "it is this cancellation that leads to the much better agreement with the experimental data at 300 k.    we now turn now to table [ ta : decompose_620 ] , which shows the contributions to the fractionation ratio at 620 k , a regime where experimentally d is preferred in the lighter phase .",
    "this is closer to the classical limit where the fractionation would be zero , thus , as expected , each component is reduced in magnitude compared to the lower temperature data in table [ ta : decompose_300 ] .",
    "however , the relative decrease in each component varies .",
    "the contributions arising from the in - plane and out - of - plane contributions orthogonal to oh decrease by a factor of 7 - 8 whereas the oh contribution falls by a factor of only @xmath294 .",
    "for the anharmonic models , the negative oh contribution outweighs the positive components in the other two directions leading to an inversion of the fractionation compared to that seen at 300 k in agreement with the experimental observation of -2 .",
    "the reason the oh component falls off more slowly is that this direction is dominated by stretching of the oh chemical bond , which is a high frequency coordinate , so even at high temperatures , quantum mechanics plays a noticeable role .",
    "in contrast , the two directions orthogonal to the oh direction are lower frequency and so approach the classical limit more rapidly as the temperature is increased .",
    "thus , the reason the h / d fractionation is low around 600 k is not due to the fact that all contributions are individually low but rather that they nearly exactly cancel at this point due to the different rates at which the components approach the classical limit .    finally , we computed the fractionation ratio for the ttm3-f water model@xcite , which is known to have a very large cancellation of its quantum mechanical effects at 300 k @xcite .",
    "this model was fit to _ ab initio _ calculations using a potential form incorporating anharmonic flexibility , geometry dependent charges , and polarizability on the oxygen site .",
    "as such , it represents the current  gold standard \" of parameterized water models and has been used extensively in recent studies probing the effects of quantum mechanical fluctuations on water @xcite . to see",
    "if the large cancellation of quantum effects predicted by this model is consistent with experimental fractionation ratios , we calculated the value at 300 k which yielded a value of @xmath30 .",
    "this is in qualitative and quantitative disagreement with the experimental results , since it predicts d to be favored in the vapor at all temperatures .",
    "this model therefore over - predicts competing quantum effects in water and hence care should be taken concerning its predictions on the effects of quantum fluctuations on water s structure and dynamics .",
    "however , based on our discussion above it is likely that reparamaterization of the oh bond anharmonicity could correct this discrepancy .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that including anharmonicity in the oh bond when modeling water is essential to obtain agreement with the experimentally observed h / d fractionation ratios and that these ratios provide an excellent method to assess the accuracy of the quantum effects predicted by models of water .",
    "since it has recently been shown that the competition between quantum mechanical effects applies to other hydrogen bonded systems @xcite , it is likely that many of our conclusions will be relevant to understanding isotopic fractionation in these systems .",
    "additionally , while we only considered equilibrium fractionation in this work , which can be calculated exactly for a given potential energy model using pimd simulations , many water processes occurring in the world s atmosphere are non - equilibrium ones . while including the effects of quantum fluctuations on dynamics is a much more challenging feat , the recent development of efficient condensed phase quantum dynamics approaches @xcite should allow insights to be gained into kinetic fractionation processes .",
    "these directions will form the basis of future work .",
