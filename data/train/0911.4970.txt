    "dipolar bose einstein condensates ( becs ) such as magnetic cr condensates are characterized by angle - dependent long - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "usually , the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions compete with the isotropic short - range @xmath0-wave contact interactions , which dictate the behaviors of alkali atom becs  @xcite as well as of two - component fermi gases such as @xmath1k and @xmath2li  @xcite . in cr ,",
    "the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath3 can be tuned to zero through the application of an external field in the vicinity of a fano - feshbach resonance , thus allowing for the realization of a pure dipolar bose gas  @xcite .",
    "although seemingly simple , dipolar bose gases in which the dipoles are aligned along a particular laboratory axis have been shown to exhibit a variety of intriguing and unique features such as so - called roton instabilities  @xcite and structured density profiles  @xcite .",
    "importantly , although the strength of the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions is fixed by the electronic structure of the atoms , it can be tuned effectively by varying the aspect ratio of the external confining potential  @xcite .",
    "this effective tunability of the dipolar interactions underlies a series of studies of dipolar gases and can be readily understood intuitively .",
    "assuming the dipoles are aligned along the @xmath4-axis , an effectively one - dimensional confinement that predominantly allows for motion along the @xmath4-axis leads to an attraction between the dipoles and thus collapse .",
    "an effectively two - dimensional confinement that predominantly allows for motion in the @xmath5-plane , in contrast , leads to a repulsion between the dipoles and thus stabilization .",
    "this paper considers a pure dipolar bose gas , aligned along the @xmath4-axis , in an oblate trapping geometry with cylindrical symmetry characterized by the aspect ratio @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , a repulsive gaussian barrier with fixed width @xmath7 and variable height @xmath8 is added along the @xmath4 direction ( centered at @xmath9 ) .",
    "when the chemical potential @xmath10 is much larger than the barrier height @xmath8 , the gaussian potential serves as a small perturbation . for @xmath11 , in contrast , the fairly narrow gaussian barrier significantly modifies the system behavior and approximately splits the dipolar condensate into two `` sheets '' or `` pancakes '' .",
    "we determine the phase and stability diagram of the dipolar gas as a function of the mean - field strength @xmath12 and the barrier height @xmath8 for various aspect ratios @xmath6 .",
    "our key results are as follows : ( i ) we find an instability island immersed in otherwise stable regions of the @xmath12 versus @xmath8 phase diagram .",
    "our analysis of the bogoliubov  de gennes excitation frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes indicates that these unstable islands arise due to a breathing mode - like instability .",
    "( ii ) we find dynamically stable density profiles of gaussian shape with superimposed ripple - like structure . for certain parameter combinations near the instability line ,",
    "these ripple - like structures exist for vanishing as well as finite gaussian barrier . as the mean - field strength increases , one of the bogoliubov  de gennes frequencies with radial roton type character becomes soft , inducing a dynamical instablility .",
    "experimentally , the instability island predicted by our calculations can be probed straightforwardly by following two different types of trajectories in the @xmath12 versus @xmath8 phase diagram : ( i ) the first experiment probes the instability by adiabatically increasing the barrier height from @xmath13 to @xmath14 or by adiabatically decreasing the barrier height from @xmath15 to @xmath16 for fixed aspect ratio @xmath6 , fixed mean - field strength @xmath12 and fixed barrier width @xmath7 ( see trajectories 1 and 2 in fig .  [ fig_trajectory ] ) .",
    "the experimental signature of the collapse would be the onset of significant atom loss at @xmath14 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "( ii ) the second experiment by - passes the instability island by moving from @xmath13 to @xmath15 and back to @xmath17 by simultaneously varying @xmath8 and @xmath12 while keeping @xmath6 and @xmath7 fixed ( trajectories 3 and 4 in fig .",

    "the instability island can be probed experimentally by following trajectories 1 and 2 that end at the edges of the dynamically unstable island ( labeled @xmath14 and @xmath16 ) , and by following trajectories 3 and 4 that encircle the instability island .",
