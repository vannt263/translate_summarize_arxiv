    "according to the results of refs  @xcite , such corrections are becoming more and more essential when @xmath2 is decreasing and dglap should not work so well at @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that dglap predictions are in a good agreement with available experimental data , leading to the conclusion that the impact of the higher - order corrections is negligibly small for the available values of @xmath2 and those corrections may be relevant at asymptotically small @xmath2 only .",
    "in the present paper we use our previous results @xcite to show that the impact of the high - order corrections on the @xmath3 and @xmath2 -evolutions of the non - singlet structure functions is indeed quite sizable at available values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that the reason for the success of phenomenological analysis of the data based on dglap at @xmath9 is related to the sharp @xmath2 -dependence assumed for the initial parton densities , which is able to mimic the role of high - order corrections .",
