    "dynamical systems exhibit an extremely rich variety of behavior with regards to transport properties .",
    "for instance , it has been known since a number of years , that the chaotic nature of the dynamics may induce stochastic - like properties in a deterministic system , like normal diffusion , as it happens for a random walk @xcite .",
    "a full understanding of how dynamics precisely determines the nature of transport in unbounded systems is however still not fully accomplished ( for instance deterministic transport is observed also for non - chaotic , yet mixing , systems @xcite ) : moreover there is a wide set of systems for which such properties are quite subtle ( for instance anomalous behavior may appear in systems with a mixed phase space as a result of long sticking times of chaotic trajectories in the vicinity or regular islands @xcite ) .    a property which has recently attracted much attention is the  ratchet effect \" , namely the generation of transport with a preferred direction , in systems without a net driving force ( or even against a small applied bias ) @xcite .",
    "while stochastic ratchets are rather well understood , we are here interested in a purely deterministic setting , the starting point being in our case a family of area - preserving maps on a cylindrical ( infinite ) phase space . as remarked in @xcite this generally requires a proper definition of what is meant by  ratchet behavior \" , as directed transport is easily achieved even for a free system , once the starting velocity is different from zero .",
    "a meaningful notion of ratchet behavior is that of getting a non - zero current for generic initial conditions without the action of a net force , provided fluctuations of the current are not so wide to overwhelm the effect .",
    "such a behavior has been thoroughly investigated in @xcite , for systems with a compact phase space : a sum rule has been established , allowing for a precise theoretical estimate of the ratchet current .",
    "we address however a completely different situation , where unbounded transport is not a priori ruled out by confining invariant structures , and the expected behavior is normal diffusion , with null average momentum .",
    "this choice is motivated both as it is theoretically challenging , in establishing examples of fully underdamped ratchets , and as modern cold atoms physics makes such systems good candidates for real experiments @xcite .",
    "though the system under investigation may be easily quantized ( see @xcite ) we here address the classical setting only : our results will provide evidence that transport properties , once we break up space - time symmetries are quite non trivial , but a classical good candidate for ratchet behavior requires an additional ingredient , which will be identified with dissipation in the present example .",
    "the paradigmatic example of transport in low dimensional hamiltonian dynamics is provided by the chirikov - taylor standard map @xmath1 living in a cylindrical phase space @xmath2 . such a map does not only provide a case study to explore dynamical scenarios that arise as the nonlinear parameter @xmath3 is varied , but it also allows to consider novel features that appear upon quantization , most notably the so - called quantum dynamical localization @xcite .",
    "such a map exhibit symmetric transport properties : namely no average current ( @xmath4 ) and linear growth of the variance ( normal diffusion ) in the regime @xmath5 @xcite .    as observed in the seminal paper @xcite , searching for directed transport involves as a starting point a modification of the map ( [ st - map ] ) in such a way to break time - space reversal symmetry .",
    "this can be accomplished in a number of ways @xcite ; we choose to follow the suggestion in @xcite , as it is both theoretically simple and experimentally clean : namely unevenly spaced , phase shifted , kicks are introduced , described by a potential of the form @xmath6 the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 being conjugate variables .",
    "the corresponding discrete dynamics over a full period ( corresponding to a pair of kicks ) is written as @xmath10 we immediately point out an important feature : the extended map ( [ map ] ) has an associated torus map , of size @xmath11 in momentum , only for @xmath12 , namely for commensurate kicking times .    our primary goal will be to investigate transport properties of the map ( [ map ] ) , in particular the first two moments @xmath13 and @xmath14 , especially for a choice of parameters values breaking space - time symmetries : in the present case this is accomplished by choosing @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "first of all we observe that if we fix a pair @xmath17 and vary the nonlinear parameter @xmath3 , a standard map - like scenario appears ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) : namely for small @xmath3 kam invariant structures create a barrier to unbounded transport , but these are destroyed for larger nonlinearity , allowing in principle unbounded trajectories on the cylinder .",
    "+         + though transport may be _ anomalous _ if sticking regularity regions influence motion in the chaotic sea , the typical behavior is normal diffusion ( linear growth of the variance ) , while symmetry breaking generally leads to a nonzero first moment . to be more precise",
    "we introduce the following notation : @xmath18 will denote the first two moments at time @xmath19 , obtained by averaging over a set @xmath20 of initial conditions : in particular a natural choice is to consider initial sets @xmath21 ( @xmath22 fixed , @xmath23 uniformly distributed on @xmath24 ) . for a wide choice of parameter values",
    "we observe that , after a transient , @xmath25 saturates to an asymptotic value @xmath26 , which has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath22 ( see the full curve in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) ) .",
    "+         + as pointed out in @xcite in this case we may obtain current reversal by tuning the phase shift between kicks ; if we start from @xmath27 , as a matter of fact , @xmath28 changes sign if we go from @xmath29 to @xmath30 ( such a property is also consistent with our analytic estimates , as we will see in the next section ) , see the full line in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "+         + so , by an appropriate choice of initial conditions we get an asymptotic momentum different from zero , and current reversal is easily obtained by tuning the phase shift between pairs of kicks ; this can hardly be termed a ratchet behavior as the momentum distribution is broad , with a diffusive spread ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) ) .",
    "+         + notice that also the diffusion constant exhibits dependence upon the starting set @xmath21 as shown by the full line in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "+         + as observed in @xcite if the two kicks take place at close times peculiar effects may arise , in the sense that a cellular structure of the phase space emerges ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) )",
    ". +         + more precisely this feature originates by requiring that the product @xmath31 is small : to keep @xmath32 small , we can not lower @xmath3 too much , otherwise the phase space is no more fully chaotic .",
    "the cells are of size @xmath33 , separated by momenta @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ; indeed at these momentum values ( called trapping momentum ) @xmath36 .",
    "they are not symmetric with respect to @xmath37 , reflecting the fact that , with broken temporal and spatial symmetry , we expect a net current ; if @xmath38 is equal to zero or @xmath39 the cells are symmetric with respect to @xmath37 ( no net current without breaking the spatial symmetry ) .",
    "the darkest cell corresponds to the cell where initial conditions are located .",
    "connected to this structure of the phase space , a typical trajectory spends a lot of time trapped in a cell before escaping onto another one , see figure ( [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "+         + transport is strongly dependent on initial conditions , in particular different behaviors emerge from initial conditions inside momentum cells or at cells boundaries , see for instance fig .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) , where the asymptotic value of momentum is plotted .",
    "+         + here cell trapping makes the dependence upon initial data more transparent : unless we go too close to the cell boundary , averages do nt depend on the exact initial condition but essentially only upon which cell we start on .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , which we follow closely , near the cells borders the map can be approximated by the standard map ( with a suitable kick strength ) .",
    "let us introduce the rescaled variable @xmath40 and the effective kick strength @xmath41 .",
    "we choose an initial condition near the trapping momentum : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we get : @xmath44\\\\ % & \\simeq&p_{0}^{\\xi}+k^{\\xi}\\sin(\\theta_{0})-k^{\\xi}\\sin(\\theta_{0})1-k%^{\\xi}\\cos(\\theta_{0})(\\delta p+k^{\\xi}\\sin(\\theta_{0})\\\\ & & \\\\ & \\simeq&p_{0}^{(\\xi)}-(k^{(\\xi)})^{2}\\cos(\\theta_{0})\\sin(\\theta_{0})-k^{(\\xi)}\\delta p\\cos(\\theta_{0 } ) .",

    "analytic estimates for the first and the second moment of momentum distribution may be obtained by a standard technique @xcite , consisting in a fourier expansion of the @xmath0-deterministic propagator , followed by inspection of leading contributions .",
