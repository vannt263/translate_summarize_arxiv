    "lateral semiconductor superlattices are realized by modern lithographic techniques to impose a periodic pattern onto a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) at a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "this pattern can be a uni- or bi - directional periodic potential modulation of different strength allowing for a variety of artificial periodic structures.@xcite magnetotransport measurements in such structures have revealed novel oscillations in the conductivity , the weiss oscillations which are superimposed on top of the well - known shubnikov - de haas oscillations.@xcite besides weiss oscillations ( a commensurability effect),novel magneto - resistance oscillations with @xmath0periodicity have been observed in short - period superlattices due to magnetic miniband energy spectrum.@xcite the above developments have renewed the interest in the problem of bloch electrons in a magnetic field , which was extensively studied in the past by renowned theorists@xcite but it is experimentally accessible now with these artificial periodic structures.@xcite    the first theoretical approach to the problem is due to peierls@xcite and it is based on the formulation of an effective single - band hamiltonian , arising from a tight - binding dispersion relation @xmath1 , through the substitution @xmath2 , where @xmath3 the vector potential . when combined to a semiclassical picture@xcite , the effective hamiltonian theory leads to the idea of quantized magnetic orbits , which can be commensurate with the lattice period . within the framework of effective single - band hamiltonian theory , further investigations lead to butterfly - like patterns for the energy spectrum known as hofstadter spectrum.@xcite",
    "this spectrum reflects , as a consequence of harper@xmath4s equation@xcite , the splitting of the single bloch - band into magnetic subbands , according to the number of magnetic flux quanta piercing the unit cell of the lattice .",
    "some recent experimental results@xcite supports the existence of the hofstadter@xmath4s spectrum in high magnetic field regime .",
    "furthermore , an experimental realization of the hofstadter s spectrum was achieved considering the transmission of microwaves@xcite and acoustic waves@xcite through an array of scatterers .    in recent years",
    "special attention has been paid to investigate the energy miniband structure@xciteas well as the transport properties of two - dimensional short - period lateral supperlattices in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 in the case of weak modulation.@xcite some calculations of superlattice electronic structure under the above conditions have used perturbation theory@xcite or a tight - binding scheme@xcite and look for solutions of the one - electron hamiltonian that are linear combination of the unperturbed extended landau wavefunctions .",
    "another approach to the problem is based on ferrari s wavefunctions@xcite , that is , wavefunctions constructed out of coherent states associated to a von neumann - type lattice.@xcite besides the effect of electric modulation , the effect of magnetic modulation on the superlattice energy spectrum has been studied@xcite and a formal connection between these two has been investigated.@xcite    in this paper we present calculations on the electronic band structure of a lateral superlattice subject to a perpendicular magnetic field by employing a projection operator technique in the context of magnetic translation group ( m.t.g ) theory .",
    "we use a new set of magnetic - consistent wannier functions given in terms of schrauben functions introduced by jannussis@xcite in order to construct bloch - like eigenfunctions that reflect the crystal symmetry of the superlattice .",
    "schrauben functions describe free electrons in a uniform magnetic field in the symmetric gauge and have been used in the past for magnetoconductance calculations.@xcite    the paper has the following structure : in section 2 the model is formulated and the projection operator of the m.t.g corresponding to the problem is introduced . in section 3",
    "we construct a basis of appropriately symmetric bloch - like wavefunctions as linear combination of schrauben functions . in section 4",
    ", the electronic spectrum of the 2des , under weak periodic modulation , is obtained . in section 5",
    ", we present specific results for periodic modulations with rectangular or triangular symmetry .",
    "the density of states is calculated as well .",
    "we conclude with a summarizing section 6 .",
    "to describe the electrons in the conduction band of a lateral superlattice at the algaas - gaas interface in a constant perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 , we employ a model of strictly two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with a 2d periodic potential modulation @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "following the common practice , we adopt an effective mass approximation , to take into account the effect of the crystalline atomic structure over the charge carriers .",
    "the system is described by the well - known single - particle hamiltonian of bloch electrons in a magnetic field : [ eq.2.1]= ( + e ) ^2 + v ( ) where we neglect the zeeman splitting and spin - orbit interactions which are very small for gaas systems .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq.2.1 ] ) does not commute with the usual translations operators [ eq.2.2 ] ( ) = where @xmath9 is any translation vector , but commutes with unitary operators of the form [ eq.2.3 ] _",

    "it is worth noting that introducing local gauge one can consider any vector potential.@xcite    the above operators ( [ eq.2.3 ] ) form the magnetic translation group ( m.t.g ) .",
    "this is in fact a ray group@xcite , because the product of two elements of the m.t.g yields another element , multiplied by a constant phase [ eq.2.5 ] _",

    ", we can verify the commutation relation [ eq.2.6 ] = 2 i _",
    "m(_1+_2 ) where the symmetric gauge for the vector potential has been used .",
    "therefore , the magnetic translation operators commute with the hamiltonian , but in general not with each other . only in the case",
    "that the phase constant in ( [ eq.2.6 ] ) is a multiple of @xmath13 , [ eq.2.7 ] ( _ 1_2 ) = q , q n we get @xmath14=0 $ ] and the operators form an abelian group . the condition ( [ eq.2.7 ] ) is compatible with the demand that the eigenfunctions of the system satisfy the born - von karman periodic boundary conditions , e.g. are periodic under magnetic translations corresponding to the full lattice size .    the term @xmath15 in ( [ eq.2.7 ] ) is the magnetic flux through the cell spanned by lattice vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 and can be written as an integer multiple ( @xmath18 ) of the flux per unit cell @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the magnetic flux quantum .",

    "<S> in this paper we present calculations on the electronic band structure of a two - dimensional lateral superlattice subject to a perpendicular magnetic field by employing a projection operator technique based on the ray - group of magnetotranslation operators . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a new basis of appropriately symmetrized bloch - like wavefunctions as linear combination of well - localized magnetic - wannier functions . the magnetic field was consistently included in the wannier functions defined in terms of free - electron eigenfunctions in the presence of external magnetic field in the symmetric gauge . using the above basis , we calculate the magnetic energy spectrum of electrons in a lateral superlattice with bi - directional weak electrostatic modulation . </S>",
    "<S> both a square lattice and a triangular one are considered as special cases . </S>",
    "<S> our approach based on group theory handles the cases of integer and rational magnetic fluxes in a uniform way and the provided basis could be convenient for further both analytic and numerical calculations . </S>"
