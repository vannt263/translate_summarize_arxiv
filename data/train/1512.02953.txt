    "one example of an open research problem in graphene is that of the zero  field excitonic condensate , which has seen significant treatment in the theoretical literature@xcite .",
    "the absence of the predicted experimental signatures  @xcite has prompted some authors to study the prototypical two ",
    "body problem  @xcite in an attempt to better understand the emergent properties of these non  trivial correlated phases .",
    "+ most of the interesting electronic behaviour in graphene can be attributed to its low energy bandstructure , which is effectively described by a pair of dirac cones  @xcite centered on the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the first brillouin zone . to first order in momentum ,",
    "the dispersion of a single electron near one of these points is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3ms@xmath4 is the fermi velocity and @xmath5 is the magnitude of the momentum relative to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics of a pair of non  interacting electrons is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the momentum and pseudospin operators , respectively , and subscripts refer to particle @xmath9 and particle @xmath10 .",
    "the most interesting two  particle behaviour occurs when the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is compensated , which occurs in the scattering channel @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , @xmath12 has four energy configurations : @xmath13 ( in which one electron is in the conduction band , and the other is in the valance band ) , @xmath14 ( when both electrons are in the upper cone ) and @xmath15 ( both electrons in the lower cone ) .",
    "the space of two  particle states is therefore partitioned into two important subspaces : the _ the non  dispersing sector _ , which is spanned by states of zero energy , and the _ dispersing sector _ of all other states .",
    "the two  particle eigenstates within the non  dispersing sector are given by@xcite : @xmath16,\\\\ \\ket{2,\\phi_{{\\boldsymbol{p}}}}&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\ket{\\uparrow\\downarrow}+\\ket{\\downarrow\\uparrow}\\right],\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\raisetag{4\\baselineskip}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the arrows represent the pseudospin configuration , in analogy with the problem of two spin@xmath17 particles , and @xmath18 is the polar angle in momentum  space defined by @xmath19 . for the states spanned by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the kinetic energy compensation was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] to lead to singular behaviour when interactions are introduced into the problem . however , the singularity arises only in the case of _ exact _ symmetry between the cones .",
    "a complete treatment of the problem therefore requires analysis beyond the conical approximation , e.g. , by the introduction of a small band curvature .",
    "+ while the conical approximation to the dispersion is typically sufficient for describing the electronic properties of graphene , it was argued in ref .",
    "[ ] that this is not true of the two  body problem .",
    "in the conical approximation , the kinetic energy of a single electron scales like @xmath22 due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , if the linear contributions cancel exactly ( as they do for the energy configuration discussed above ) the dominant term is due to a small band curvature , which instead scales like @xmath23 . if the particles interact via a coulomb potential ( @xmath24 ) then a quadratic kinetic energy of the appropriate sign@xcite leads to bound state formation regardless of the interaction strength@xcite .",
    "+ in order to understand the origin and significance of the band curvature , we consider the single  particle hamiltonian discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] , which is given by @xmath25 where h.c . denotes the hermitian conjugate of the previous term , @xmath26 and @xmath27 determines the sign of the trigonal warping term for a particle near the @xmath28point .",
    "there are also two new parameters which determine the energy in eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) : the first is an effective mass @xmath29 , which arises due to hopping between next ",
    "nearest  neighbours ( where @xmath30 is the next  nearest  neighbour hopping parameter @xcite and @xmath31 is the carbon  carbon distance in graphene ) ; the second arises due to the trigonal warping of the bands , and is given by @xmath32 ( where @xmath33ev is the nearest  neighbour  hopping parameter ) .",
    "the effective mass can be as high as @xmath34 ( see discussion of @xmath30 below ) , so that the isotropic contribution to the band curvature is small .",
    "when @xmath35 however , the curvature is sufficiently large to induce pairing@xcite . unlike the linear terms , the quadratic terms do not change their sign under @xmath36 , and hence do not cancel in the non  dispersing sector ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for particles in the non  dispersing sector can be constructed by projecting out the high energy states@xcite : @xmath37\\label{direct},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for two particles in the same valley , where the rows and columns correspond to states @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath38 . in this work",
    "we will consider the case of two particles in the same valley ( the so  called _ direct pairs _ ) so that @xmath39 .",
    "+ it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that the electron  electron pair described by eq .",
    "( [ direct ] ) has negative  definite kinetic energy when the nearest ",
    "neighbour  hopping parameter ( @xmath30 ) takes a certain size .",
    "we note that @xmath30 is not tuneable , but there is some disagreement about its precise value ( see the discussion in [ ] and references therein ) which is expected to fall in the range @xmath40 .",
    "the role of @xmath30 can be understood by noting that eq .",

    "anisotropy parameter _",
    "@xmath42 . if @xmath43 the isotropic term dominates , and the kinetic energy is negative definite , so that pairing will occur for a repulsive interaction",
    "when @xmath44 the kinetic energy is sign  indefinite , and the anisotropy due to trigonal warping is more important@xcite .",
    "the aforementioned range of possible values of @xmath30 leads to a corresponding value for the anisotropy parameter : @xmath45 .",
    "+ it is instructive to compare the interaction effects described in ref .",
    "[ ] to other , more familiar condensed matter systems . in semiconductors at low doping , attractive interactions result in binding between electrons near the bottom of an empty conduction band and holes near the top of a filled valence band , separated by a gap .",
    "when the concentrations of electrons and holes are sufficiently low , one can ignore the effects of fermi statistics and describe the excitons in terms of two constituent massive particles .",
    "the resulting energy levels are dependent on dimensionality and the details of the interaction .",
    "in contrast to this , metals admit low  energy excitations which involve transitions between electron states near the fermi level within the same band .",
    "most of these transitions are blocked due to the pauli exclusion principle , which may result in low  temperature anomalies and , eventually , the formation of strongly correlated phases such as ferromagnets , charge density waves , etc .",
    "the details of such transitions depend upon the interaction between the electrons , as well as the structure of the single particle spectrum . in the case of a weak attractive interaction and flat density of states ,",
    "the restrictions arising from pauli blocking can result in the formation of a bound state known as a cooper pair , irrespective of the dimensionality .",
    "the many  body physics of graphene does not fit neatly into either of the scenarios above . on the one hand ,",
    "monolayer graphene is gapless , so that elementary excitations can not be thought of as entirely seperate from the sea of free carriers , as they can be in semiconductors . on the other hand ,",
    "the density of states is linear , and vanishes near the charge  neutrality point .",
    "therefore , graphene ( near @xmath46 ) can not be considered to be a metal , either ( for a full discussion see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] ) . further , due to the linear dispersion , the coulomb coupling constant is independent of the density of free carriers , and electron  electron interactions are important irrespective of the doping .",
    "this is not the case for a two  dimensional electron gas with parabolic dispersion@xcite .",
    "it is therefore unclear whether the two  body problem will necessarily stand on its own or , e.g. , be valid for only some ( if any ) doping regimes when the effects of the dirac sea are taken into account .",
    "thus , it is desirable to incorporate the effects of pauli blocking and screening into the two  body problem of an interacting electron ",
    "electron pair .",
    "+ in this work , we show that the electron  electron pairs which form in the subspace of non  dispersing two  particle states have their energies renormalized by many  body effects .",
    "we study the two most important many ",
    "body phenomena at zero temperature : screening of the interaction by free carriers in the dirac sea , and ( ii ) pauli blocking , in which scattering into single ",
    "particle states below the fermi level is forbidden due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we show that the problem admits an analytic solution when the interaction is short  ranged ( in the subspace of states where the trigonal warping is compensated ) .",
    "we then treat the complete problem , with bandstructure warping and screened interaction potential , numerically .",
    "for both single and double  layered structures we find good agreement between numerical results and our exact solution which is applicable when the exponential factor is of the order of one , or even less .",
    "+ the rest of the paper will have the following structure . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss a simple heuristic model in which the subspace of states where trigonal warping is not important are studied .",
    "we show that this model has an analytic solution when the interaction potential is sufficiently short  ranged . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the role of screening and examine the effective electron ",
    "electron interaction in single and double  layered structures .",
    "we show that the screening is vital for accurately determining the binding energies in systems near @xmath47 , and exponentially suppresses the binding when the system is heavily doped . in sec . iv we discuss the results of numerical calculations of the binding energies of pairs , including the effects of",
    "trigonal warping and momentum ",
    "dependent interaction neglected in sec .",
    "we find that the numerical results agree with our analytical solutions in the low  doping regime , where the binding energies are proportional to the fermi energy .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with a summary of important results . in appendix",
    "a we show how the two  particle schrdinger equation with the pauli blocking constraint , eq .",
    "( [ scheq ] ) , can be derived from the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation , and in appendix b we discuss the form of the electron  electron interaction for double layer systems with non  trivial dielectric environment .",
    "a formal treatment of electron  electron pairing in the dirac sea requires the solution of the bethe  salpeter equation .",
    "we perform that calculation in detail in appendix a , but it is helpful to first treat a heuristic model which incorporates the most important many  body effects in a simple way .",
    "+ we begin with two natural assumptions : ( i ) that the free carriers screen the electron  electron interaction to the extent that it can be considered short",
    " ranged , and ( ii ) transitions into paired states in which one of the electrons is below the fermi level are blocked by the pauli exclusion principle@xcite . in the limit of large hole doping , the interaction is suppressed for distances @xmath48 , so as a first approximation we assume that the electron ",
    "electron interaction takes the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 determines the strength of the interaction which is different for single and double  layered systems .",
    "our second assumption is equivalent to only allowing contributions of momenta in the range @xmath51 .",
    "we will show that , subject to these assumptions , the problem admits an analytical solution .",
    "+ it is instructive to first recall the case of a two  dimensional massive particle in a short  ranged potential @xmath52 of interaction radius @xmath53 . for a weak potential ,",
    "the bound state is shallow , and the wavefunction is concentrated at the distances @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to approximate the potential by a delta function , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "this gives the binding energy in the form@xcite : @xmath57 represents the energy cutoff which is determined by the behaviour of @xmath52 at distances @xmath58 .",
    "thus , it shows that the model with a delta  like potential is incomplete , and has to be regularized at short distances in a non  universal way .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 5 ) is only applicable for @xmath59 , so that the binding energy is determined by the universal exponentially small factor . since the dynamics of the electron ",
    "electron pair is governed by quadratic kinetic energy , the bound state in this problem has similar properties .",
    "however the regularization is now provided by the momentum space cutoff at @xmath60 , rather than the interaction radius @xmath53 .",
    "we will show below that this leads to an exact solution for the binding energy of the bielectron , as opposed to the approximate solution of eq .",
    "( [ approxenergy ] ) . not only does this cutoff extend the range of validity of the solution to @xmath61 , we will show below that it is vital if one is to correctly determine the low  doping behaviour of the system .",
    "+ we consider the states with configuration @xmath62 $ ] , so that the two  particle wavefunction is given by @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy is isotropic and there is a trivial overlap of states with different momenta@xcite .",
    "further , we assume that the deformation of the valence band due to trigonal warping is not important , so the fermi surface can be approximated by a circle of radius @xmath64 . within the momentum representation ,",
    "the schrdinger equation takes the form ( from now on we choose @xmath65 ) : @xmath66 the short  ranged potential is described by a momentum ",
    "independent interaction : @xmath67 . within this approximation ,",
    "the integral equation ( [ scheq ] ) is separable , with eigenfunctions : @xmath68 substitution of eq .",
    "( [ wavefunction ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ scheq ] ) gives a simple integral equation , which is readily solved : @xmath69.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the binding energies of the pair therefore take the form : @xmath70 for a repulsive potential , @xmath71 , the energies are positive definite .",
    "further , the pairs are only destroyed by many  body effects in two limits : @xmath72 ( the neutrality point , when the phase space is full and all pairing is blocked ) and @xmath73 ( the limit of the ultra  dense hole gas , in which screening fully suppresses the interaction at all length scales ) .",
    "the states are therefore not destroyed for any systems of experimental interest .",
    "( [ energies ] ) can be understood as the product of two factors which compete to determine the binding energy .",
    "the first factor , which scales as @xmath74 , arose in our calculation due solely to the momentum cutoff in the integral equation ( [ scheq ] ) , and can therefore be understood as the contribution of pauli blocking to the pairing . as the system is tuned towards the charge neutrality point from below , @xmath75 ,",
    "the phase space available to accommodate pairs in the channel @xmath76 shrinks , and the binding is suppressed as @xmath72 .",
    "the second factor depends on @xmath50 and is therefore governed by the strength of the interaction . in the next section",
    "we will show that , @xmath77 , so that for both cases of interest ( monolayer ( @xmath78 ) and double  layer ( @xmath79 ) systems ) it leads to an exponential suppression of the binding energy for large @xmath64 .",
    "to understand the doping dependence of the binding energies from eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) , we now discuss the dependence of the potential strength @xmath80 on the fermi energy .",
    "we will derive the forms of the one and two  layer screened interaction within the random  phase approximation and use them to determine @xmath50 .",
    "we note that only the repulsive coulomb interaction is considered in this paper .",
    "this is in contrast to , e.g. , the case of traditional superconductivity , in which the repulsive coulomb interaction is not sufficient to cause pair binding , and the hamiltonian must be extended by the attractive electron  phonon interaction . because the kinetic energy of the pair is negative  definite and parabolic in the momentum ,",
    "binding occurs for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction@xcite in two dimensions in analogy with the case of a massive particle in an arbitrarily shallow well , which has been shown to exhibit at least one bound state in , e.g. , ref .",
    "+ we begin with the case of a graphene monolayer in an environment of dielectric constant @xmath81 . if @xmath82 , within the random phase approximation , the effective electron  electron interaction @xmath83 takes the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the polarizability of the system and @xmath86 is the bare coulomb interaction in the momentum representation . for sufficiently small momenta , @xmath87",

    "let us introduce the crossover scale by setting the argument of the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ energies ] ) to unity .",
    "this occurs when the magnitude of the fermi energy is of the order of @xmath100ev . in the limit of high doping ( @xmath101 ) the binding energies",
    "are exponentially suppressed : @xmath102 but we note that this suppression would be hard to observe , due to the large doping required : @xmath103ev .",
    "hence , only the limit @xmath104 is discussed below .",
    "+ let us now turn to the case of two layers separated by a dielectric spacer of thickness @xmath105 .",
    "we assume that the device is fully embedded in the same dielectric material .",
    "the case of a dielectric spacer between the layers with permittivity different from that of the environment requires some extra analysis , which is given in appendix b. assuming the electrons are in opposite layers , the potential takes the form ( see , e.g. , refs . [ ] and [ ] ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the polarizabilities of layer @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest case where the polarizabilities of the two layers are the same : @xmath108 .",
    "this is equivalent to the assumption that the fermi levels of the two layers are tuned to the same value : @xmath109 . following the reasoning applied to the single ",
    "layer case above , we obtain for the interaction strength : @xmath110 therefore , the crossover to weak binding in the double  layer case occurs at a different fermi energy , @xmath111 , which for inter  layer separation @xmath112 nm is given by @xmath113ev . the fact that @xmath114 is due to the large minimum separation of two particles when they are confined to separate layers : even when the in  plane distance between the electrons is zero , they are still separated by @xmath115 nm . in the limit of high doping ( @xmath116 )",
    "the binding energies are again exponentially suppressed : @xmath117 we therefore expect screening to be the limiting factor in the binding energy for large @xmath64 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the coulomb interaction is only weakly screened in graphene doped near the neutrality point , @xmath118 . as noted above",
    ", pauli blocking is particularly important in this regime , giving a contribution @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , screening does reduce this suppression for finite negative doping , leading to binding energies which are linear in the fermi energy : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of graphene layers .",
    "we note the role of the exact cutoff momenta of eq .",
    "( [ scheq ] ) : they prevent the binding energies from becoming singular as @xmath75 .",
    "+ finally , let us reiterate that we have focussed our attention on the simplest case of equal doping , when @xmath121 . because the pairs reside in opposite cones and have opposite momenta , the limiting role is played by the layer which hosts the lower ",
    "cone electron ( which we will now call layer 1 , without loss of generality ) .",
    "clearly fermi statistics does not change the problem at all for any level of hole doping in layer 2 , as the necessary phase space is always free for an electron in the upper cone : all that is required is @xmath122 . on the other hand , the form of eq .",
    "( [ doublelayer ] ) suggests that inequivalent doping might significantly change the strength of the interlayer potential .",
    "let the fermi energies of layers @xmath9 and @xmath10 be given by @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",

    "for the two  layer case , the results were obtained for graphene in a hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) environment .",
    "for the one  layer case , however , our analytical result is entirely independent of the substrate ( see eq .",
    "[ strength1 ] ) . in both configurations",
