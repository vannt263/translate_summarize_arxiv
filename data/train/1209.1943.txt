    "most of the decidability results in computable set theory concern one - sorted multi - level syllogistics , namely collections of formulae admitting variables of one sort only , which range over the von neumann universe of sets ( see @xcite for a thorough account of the state - of - art until 2001 )",
    ". only a few stratified syllogistics , where variables of different sorts are allowed , have been investigated , despite the fact that in many fields of computer science and mathematics often one has to deal with multi - sorted languages .",
    "for instance , in modal logics , one has to consider entities of different types , namely worlds , formulae , and accessibility relations .    in @xcite",
    "an efficient decision procedure was presented for the satisfiability of the two - level syllogistic language ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath5 has variables of two sorts and admits propositional connectives together with the basic set - theoretic operators @xmath6 , and the predicate symbols @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",

    "tarski s and presburger s arithmetics extended with sets have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite , a three - sorted language @xmath9 ( three - level syllogistic with singleton , powerset and general union ) has been proved decidable .",
    "recently , in @xcite , it was shown that the language @xmath10 ( three - level quantified syllogistic with restricted quantifiers ) has a decidable satisfiability problem .",

    "its vocabulary contains only the predicate symbols @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in spite of that",
    ", @xmath10 allows one to express several constructs of set theory . among them ,",
    "the most comprehensive one is the set - formation operator , which in turn enables one to express other operators like the powerset operator , the singleton operator , and so on . in @xcite",
    "it is also shown that the modal logic @xmath13 can be expressed in a fragment of @xmath10 , whose satisfiability problem is -complete .    in this paper",

    "@xmath0 is an extension of @xmath10 admitting variables of four sorts and a restricted form of quantification over variables of the first three sorts .",
    "in addition to the predicate symbols @xmath11 and @xmath12 , its vocabulary contains also the pairing operator @xmath14 .    we will prove that the theory @xmath0 enjoys a small model property by showing how one can extract , out of a given model satisfying a @xmath0-formula @xmath15 , another model of @xmath15 but of bounded finite cardinality .",
    "the construction of the finite model extends the decision algorithm described in @xcite . concerning complexity issues",
    ", we will show that the satisfiability problem for each of the fragments @xmath1 of @xmath0 , whose formulae are restricted to have their quantifier prefixes of length at most @xmath2 and must satisfy certain additional syntactic constraints to be seen later , is -complete .",
    "in addition to the modal logic @xmath13 , already expressible in the language @xmath10 , it turns out that in @xmath0 one can also formalize several properties of binary relations ( needed to define accessibility relations of well - known modal logics ) and some boolean operations over relations and the inverse operation over binary relations .",

    "@xcite ) and @xmath0 , and for some of their sublanguages like , for instance , the sublanguages of @xmath0 characterized by the fact that quantifier prefixes have length bounded by a constant . according to the construction of section [ ssseuniv ] small models for formulae of these sublanguages have a finite domain @xmath131 that is polynomial in the size of the formula",
    ". however , their formulae are not subject to the syntactical constraints characterizing formulae of the @xmath1 languages and allowing the satisfiability problem for the @xmath1 fragments to be -complete .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , stratified syllogistics have been studied less than one sorted multi - level ones .",

    "currently , in the case of modal logics characterized by a liberal accessibility relation like @xmath470 , we are not able to translate the modal formulae @xmath577 and @xmath576 in @xmath0 .",
    "we plan to verify if @xmath0 allows one to express modal logics with nesting of modal operators of bounded length .",
    "we also intend to investigate extensions of @xmath0 which allow one to express suitably constrained occurrences of the composition operator on binary relations and of the set - theoretic operator of general union .",
    "we expect that these extensions will make it possible to express all the normal modal logic systems and several multi - modal logics .",
