    "the kakeya conjecture is a long standing open problem in the field of geometric combinatorics which is concerned with the extent to which a large direction - separated family of thin tubes can be compressed into a small space .",
    "there are essentially two formulations of the conjecture : one geometric and the other analytic . in order to state the geometric formulation of the conjecture",
    ", we shall need the following fundamental definition :    a set @xmath4 is said to be a _ kakeya set _",
    "if for any direction @xmath5 , there exists a unit line segment @xmath6 parallel to @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "the kakeya conjecture is concerned with the dimension of such objects .",
    "explicitly ,    [ kakeyaconjecture : dim ] if @xmath4 is a kakeya set , then @xmath9 .    strictly speaking , conjecture [ kakeyaconjecture : dim ] should be interpreted as three separate conjectures , as one can consider the hausdorff dimension ( denoted @xmath10 ) , lower minkowski dimension ( denoted @xmath11 ) or upper minkowski dimension ( denoted @xmath12 ) of such sets ; these different notions of dimension are discussed at great length in most texts on geometric measure theory , for example @xcite and @xcite . by definition",
    ", one has @xmath13 for any set @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , any progress on the hausdorff version of the kakeya conjecture will immediately imply progress on the other two versions .",
    "it is not known , however , whether all three versions of the conjecture are actually equivalent .",
    "furthermore , the best known results concerning the conjecture differ for each of the various notions of dimension ( see @xcite and @xcite for examples of this phenomenon ) .",
    "the analytic formulation of the conjecture concerns the boundedness of the kakeya maximal function :    given a function @xmath14 and a number @xmath15 , we may define the _ kakeya maximal function _ as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the tube of dimensions @xmath18 centered at the point @xmath19 , oriented in the direction @xmath7 .    with this definition",
    ", we may state the analytic version of the conjecture :    for all @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , one has @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the rotationally invariant probability measure on the unit sphere .",
    "it is now known , thanks to an observation of bourgain @xcite , that any progress towards the resolution of the analytic formulation automatically implies progress towards the geometric formulation . in particular ,",
    "if the kakeya maximal function is bounded on @xmath0 , it follows that kakeya sets have hausdorff ( and , hence , upper and lower minkowski ) dimension at least @xmath25 .",
    "modern investigations of this conjecture essentially date back to the 1970 s , when davies @xcite proved that any kakeya set in @xmath26 has hausdorff dimension ( and , hence , upper and lower minkowski dimension ) @xmath27 .",
    "later , crdoba @xcite proved the analogous result for the maximal function in @xmath26 .",
    "though these two results essentially resolved all questions concerning the kakeya conjecture in @xmath27 dimensions , the conjecture remains open in dimensions @xmath28 and higher .",
    "the @xmath29 problem is a variant of the kakeya problem in which one replaces lines with @xmath30-planes . in order to formally describe the @xmath29 problem",
    ", we need a few definitions .",
    "a set @xmath4 is said to be an @xmath29 _ set _",
    "if for any @xmath30-dimensional subspace @xmath31 , there exists a @xmath30-dimensional unit cube @xmath32 parallel to @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .    clearly , an @xmath35 set is simply a kakeya set .",
    "the geometric conjecture associated with these sets is essentially the same as the kakeya conjecture :    if @xmath4 is an @xmath29 set , then @xmath36 .",
    "once again , dimension can be taken as upper minkowski , lower minkowski or hausdorff .",
    "one can also define the @xmath29 maximal function :    given positive integers @xmath37 , let @xmath38 denote the grassmannian manifold of all @xmath30-dimensional subspaces of @xmath39 . for a function @xmath14 and a real number @xmath40",
    ", we define the @xmath29 _ maximal function _ as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the @xmath43-neighborhood of the @xmath30-dimensional unit cube parallel to @xmath33 and centered at @xmath44 .",
    "using this definition , the analytic version of the @xmath29 conjecture is then    for all @xmath20 , and @xmath45 , one has @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the rotationally invariant probability measure on @xmath38 .",
    "though a large amount of work has been devoted to the @xmath29 problems mentioned here , as well as various other @xmath30-plane transforms ( for example , see the work of strichartz @xcite , christ @xcite and drury @xcite ) , the previous results most relevant to this paper are those due to oberlin and stein @xcite , themis mitsis @xcite,@xcite , as well as wolff s bound for the kakeya maximal function @xcite    we investigate the problem in the setting of vector spaces over finite fields ; this slightly unconventional choice of vector spaces was inspired by a recent paper due to mockenhaupt and tao @xcite .",
    "when working in a discrete setting , one is allowed to focus almost exclusively on the geometric and combinatorial aspects of the problem .",
    "in particular , problems which arise in the study of kakeya - type problems in euclidean spaces due to multiplicity of scales ( in particular , the troublesome behavior of @xmath43-tubes which intersect at small angles ) are essentially non - existent in the discrete setting .",
    "furthermore , working in this setting allows one to import useful tools from other areas of mathematics , such as analytic number theory ( gauss sums , kloosterman sums ) and incidence geometry .",
    "there are , of course , a few negative side - effects resulting from the discretization of the problem .",
    "for example , taylor approximations of surfaces do nt make sense in @xmath49 , and there is no chance to make use of arguments requiring induction on scales .    before stating the main result ,",
    "a bit of notation is necessary . given a finite field @xmath50 , we let @xmath38 denote the ( grassmannian ) set of all @xmath30-dimensional subspaces of the vector space @xmath49 .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath50 is a very large finite field .",
    "aside from the fact that the results discussed here are somewhat trivial when @xmath50 is small , working with large fields allows one to develop an intuition regarding the minkowski dimension of the geometric objects we will be studying .",
    "when considering lebesgue spaces of functions defined on @xmath51 , we endow this set with a normalized counting measure @xmath52 , so that for any subset @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 simply denotes cardinality ) .",
    "the vector space @xmath49 is endowed with a standard counting measure @xmath56 . with this notation",
    ", we may define the @xmath29 maximal function operator as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some real - valued function on @xmath49 , and @xmath59 .",
    "our primary objective here will be to determine a class of lebesgue spaces on which this operator is `` bounded '' .",
    "of course , since we are working in vector spaces over finite fields , we wo nt be encountering any divergent integrals .",
    "our definition of boundedness will be as follows :    [ definition ] let @xmath60 denote the smallest quantity such that @xmath61 holds for all functions @xmath62 .",
    "we say that @xmath63 is _ bounded _ from @xmath0 to @xmath1 if @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "the notation @xmath66 in the above definition means that for all @xmath20 , there exists some constant @xmath67 such that @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , @xmath69 indicates @xmath70 for some constant @xmath71 independent of the field @xmath50 .",
    "also , we say @xmath72 ( respectively @xmath73 ) if @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( respectively @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "one can immediately observe a few necessary conditions on @xmath25 and @xmath78 by examining certain counterexamples .",
    "for example , observing the function @xmath79 shows that one must have @xmath80 . also , considering the function @xmath81 for some @xmath30-plane @xmath82 will reveal that one must have @xmath83 .",
    "it is conjectured that these necessary conditions are also sufficient , though only partial results are currently available .",
    "our main result will be a proof of the following result for the @xmath29 maximal function by means of incidence combinatorial techniques :    [ mainthm ] let @xmath84 , @xmath30 be positive integers such that @xmath85 . the operator @xmath86 is bounded when @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "as an immediate corollary , we have the following result concerning the geometric version of the @xmath29 problem :    let @xmath89 be an @xmath29 set , where @xmath85 are integers .",
    "then , @xmath90    it should be noted that theorem [ mainthm ] is in no way the best known result for the @xmath29 problem . in the euclidean case",
    ", bourgain @xcite showed that @xmath29 sets have positive @xmath84-dimensional lebesgue measure whenever @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , oberlin ( @xcite , @xcite ) has generalized this result to the corresponding maximal function estimate , and improved the result for certain values of @xmath84 and @xmath30 by making use of recent advances concerning the x - ray transform ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the novelty of theorem [ mainthm ] is in its proof ; the proof presented here is entirely combinatorial , whereas the work of bourgain and oberlin incorporates tools from fourier analysis , thus leading to stronger results .",
    "this result might be interpreted as an extension of the work of wolff @xcite , who showed that @xmath35 sets have cardinality @xmath92 , and oberlin and stein @xcite , whose work implies that @xmath93 sets have cardinality @xmath94 .",
    "a euclidean version of the case @xmath95 was first proven by mitsis @xcite .",
    "his proof is an adaptation of the  hairbrush \" construction used by wolff to demonstrate a bound for the kakeya maximal function . for our purposes",
    ", we shall be following the example set by mockenhaupt and tao @xcite who find an alternate proof of wolff s kakeya result by incidence combinatorial methods .",
    "furthermore , the two methods are , in a certain sense,equivalent \" . for more details ,",
    "the reader is directed to @xcite . ] .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows : in section [ prelim ] , we will introduce the main combinatorial tools which will be used in later computations , and establish a correspondence between bounds on the number of incidences between points and @xmath30-planes and estimates for the @xmath29 maximal function as defined in equation .",
    "next , in section [ reductions ] , we will prove a generalized version of wolff s  two - ends reduction \" .",
    "this reduction will allow us to prove non - trivial incidence bounds without being hindered by the existence of certain pathological configurations of points and @xmath30-planes .",
    "the remaining sections will be devoted to proving an incidence bound between points and @xmath30-planes .",
    "we shall arrive at this bound by estimating the number of @xmath96-simplices arising from a configuration of points @xmath97 and @xmath30-planes @xmath98 which have vertices from @xmath97 and faces from @xmath98 .",
    "the lower bound for the number of such simplices is computed by an inductive procedure , and is addressed in sections [ firstproof ] and [ indreg ] .",
    "the upper bound for the number of simplices is computed in section [ upperbound ] .",
    "i would like to acknowledge terence tao for introducing me to this problem and for his guidance .",
    "also , i would like to thank richard oberlin for his careful reading of , and helpful comments concerning this paper .",
    "as the proof of the main theorem in this paper will be largely combinatorial , our first task will be to establish some machinery designed to translate incidence combinatorial results into maximal function estimates , and vice versa .    an important combinatorial tool which will be used extensively the following set - theoretical version of cauchy - schwarz :    [ stcs ] let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be finite sets with some relation @xmath101 between elements @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "then , @xmath104    to see how theorem [ stcs ] follows from the traditional cauchy - schwarz inequality , define a function @xmath58 on the set @xmath100 as @xmath105    next , using cauchy - schwarz , we have @xmath106 where the @xmath107 norm is computed with respect to counting measure on the finite set @xmath100 . theorem [ stcs ]",
    "then follows by observing that @xmath108 and @xmath109    in practice , the sets @xmath99 and @xmath100 will always denote certain configurations of points , planes and lines , and the relation @xmath110 will denote some sort of geometric incidence .",
    "for example , given a configuration of points @xmath97 and @xmath30-planes @xmath98 , we may obtain a lower bound on the number of `` double point - plane incidences '' in terms of the numbers of point - plane incidences and planes : @xmath111 of course , this idea can be generalized into a version of hlder s inequality : @xmath112    the set appearing on the right hand side of both and is known as the _ incidence set _ associated to the points @xmath97 and @xmath30-planes @xmath98 . as this set",
    "will be appearing quite often throughout this paper , we ll introduce the following notation : @xmath113 often , the arguments @xmath97 and @xmath98 will be suppressed when they are obvious from the context .    the following correlation between maximal function estimates and incidence bounds",
    "is used in @xcite to demonstrate a bound for the kakeya maximal function , and we generalize it to suit our purposes as follows :    [ max - ic ] given exponents @xmath114 , the bound @xmath64 holds if and only if given any collection of points @xmath115 and any direction separated collection of @xmath30-planes @xmath98 contained in @xmath49 , the following incidence bound holds : @xmath116    before proceeding with the proof , note that the conjectured best possible incidence bound ( corresponding to the necessary conditions @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) is @xmath119 this expression will appear several times throughout the course of the paper .",
    "first , we assume @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be as in the statement of the proposition , and let @xmath121 denote the direction set of @xmath98 ( i.e. each @xmath122 is a parallel translate of exactly one element of @xmath123 ) .",
    "then , the result simply follows from hlder s inequality : @xmath124    to prove the converse , it suffices ( by duality ) to show @xmath125 for any pair of functions @xmath58 and @xmath126 ( defined on @xmath49 and @xmath51 , respectively ) , where @xmath127 is some function which translates elements of @xmath51 to affine position .",
    "since out notation allows us to lose factors of @xmath128 , we may employ the dyadic pigeonhole principle , and assume that @xmath129 and @xmath130 for sets @xmath115 , and @xmath121 .",
    "after making these simplifications , we must now show @xmath131    now , simply define the collection of @xmath30-planes to be @xmath132 .",
    "the above equation then follows directly from .",
    "in this section , we address an issue which often causes problems when counting incidences between points and ( generally speaking ) algebraic varieties of dimension greater than @xmath133 : it is quite easy to construct a large set of points @xmath97 and a large set of planes @xmath98 such that every point is contained in every plane .",
    "the classic example of this behavior can be seen in the following example :    a _",
    "type-@xmath134 degenerate configuration _ is a configuration of a set of points @xmath97 and a set of 2-planes @xmath98 such that all of the points in @xmath97 lie on some line @xmath135 , and all of the planes in @xmath98 contain the line @xmath135 .",
    "degenerate configuration . ]    [ 21degpic ]    this configuration is notable because the incidence set associated to it actually attains the worst possible upper bound , @xmath136 .",
    "so , it seems that this counterexample should prohibit us from obtaining any sort of nontrivial upper bound on the size of the incidence set which would hold for all possible collections of points and planes . for higher values of @xmath30 ,",
    "there are even more possible degenerate configurations of this type ; given a positive integer @xmath137 , one can consider a family of @xmath138 points which all lie on some affine @xmath139-plane @xmath140 , and a direction separated collection @xmath141 @xmath30-planes which all contain @xmath140 .",
    "we shall call such a configuration _ type-@xmath142",
    "degenerate_.    because of the existence of such configurations , it is necessary to place some ( presumably mild ) restrictions on distributions of points and/or planes in question . in recent work concerning incidences between points and surfaces , ( for example , aba and solymosi @xcite , and elekes and tth @xcite ) ,",
    "point sets were assumed to have certain uniformity properties to prohibit pathological configurations .",
    "for our purposes , however , we shall work with arbitrary distributions of points in @xmath49 , and exploit the fact that any family of planes in consideration must be direction separated .",
    "the following proposition acts in the same way as the `` two - ends reduction '' first used by wolff @xcite to improve estimates for the kakeya maximal function .",
    "we will eliminate the threat posed by configurations in which points tend to cluster along low dimensional subsets of @xmath30-planes from @xmath98 by eliminating the possibility of having sparsely populated @xmath30-planes .",
    "the actual proof of this new version of the reduction for the @xmath29 problem is quite different from wolff s ; it is more closely related to drury s work on the x - ray transform @xcite .",
    "[ hyperred ] let @xmath115 be a collection of points , and @xmath98 a direction separated collection @xmath30-planes in @xmath49 such that @xmath143 and @xmath144    then , the best possible incidence bound holds : @xmath145    the proof of this proposition will be inductive .",
    "we shall first show that holds under the assumption @xmath146 ( hence it is safe to assume @xmath147 ) , and then show that the result holds when @xmath148 for any integer @xmath149 .",
    "suppose @xmath150 .",
    "then , making use of the trivial estimates @xmath151 and @xmath152 , we have @xmath153 therefore , we may assume @xmath147 .",
    "next , assume that @xmath154 for some positive integer @xmath155 . in order to arrive at the desired conclusion",
    ", we will estimate the size of the following set @xmath156 using hlder s inequality , we arrive at a lower bound of @xmath157    in order to compute a corresponding upper bound , we break the set @xmath158 into a union of disjoint subsets in the following manner : @xmath159 where @xmath160=j\\}\\ ] ]    now we estimate each of these subsets separately .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath161 next , when @xmath162 , we have @xmath163 choices for the @xmath30-plane , @xmath164 choices for a @xmath165-tuple of points which spans @xmath166 $ ] , and @xmath167 choices for the remaining points .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath168    finally , in order to estimate @xmath169 , we observe that there are @xmath170 choices for the @xmath171-tuple of points , and ( because the collection of @xmath30-planes is direction separated ) there are at most @xmath172 @xmath30-planes for the collection @xmath98 which can contain the @xmath139-dimensional affine space spanned by the already chosen @xmath171-tuple of points .",
    "putting together all of these observations , we have @xmath173 furthermore , since we are assuming @xmath174 , we have @xmath175 whenever @xmath162 . similarly , @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , the first term on the right hand side of equation is dominant , and we have @xmath177 a bit of algebraic manipulation then leads us to the following incidence bound : @xmath178    finally , we do a bit more algebra , and observe that @xmath179 since this is true whenever @xmath180 , we are done .    it should be noted that in the special case when @xmath181 and @xmath182 , all four of the quantities @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 coincide .",
    "these values for @xmath187 and @xmath163 are , of course , the same values that one would see in the construction of a type-@xmath142 degenerate configuration , as was described earlier in this section .",
    "these configurations , therefore , are examples of situations in which the worst possible incidence bound coincides with the best possible incidence bound .",
    "now that we have eliminated the potential problems caused by the existence of sparsely populated @xmath30-planes , we are in a position to formulate a more flexible version of proposition [ max - ic ] . in order to make use of proposition [ hyperred ] in what follows",
    ", we shall need to establish some notation . given a collection of points @xmath97 and a direction separated collection of @xmath30-planes @xmath98 , it is clear that the following equality holds : @xmath188 therefore , by pigeonholing , there exists a subcollection @xmath189 such that @xmath190 the only control we have over the size of the set @xmath191 is the trivial estimate @xmath192 .",
    "furthermore , letting @xmath193 denote the incidence set @xmath194 , we have @xmath195    with this notation in place , we may now state and prove the following proposition :    [ max - ick ] let @xmath196 be real numbers such that @xmath197 .",

    "this technicality prevents us from using the methods described here to demonstrate an entirely geometric proof of the result of oberlin and stein .",
    "to start with , if the term @xmath205 dominates , then we arrive at the best possible bound : @xmath206 so , we may also assume @xmath207 .    if the term @xmath208 dominates the right - hand side of equation , then ( since our refinements allow us to assume equation holds ) proposition [ hyperred ] shows that we obtain the best possible incidence bound .",
    "therefore , we may assume @xmath209 .",
    "to finish the proof , assume @xmath210 .",

    "have been constructed ( for some integer @xmath446 ) , one can choose a collection @xmath447 of disjoint pairs of points and @xmath448-planes , and use this collection to define ( as was described at the beginning of this section ) to create families @xmath449 and @xmath450 of points and @xmath451-planes which satisfy the estimates @xmath452 furthermore , by identifying elements of the sets @xmath453 and @xmath454 , we have the estimate @xmath455 since these observations hold for any integer @xmath446 , we arrive at the following conclusion : @xmath456    at this point , since we have reduced to problem to estimating the size of a family of @xmath423-chains , we may use cauchy - schwarz .",
    "the construction of elements of the set @xmath457 is virtually identical to the construction of the sets @xmath458 , except that we add an extra point to each of the @xmath390-planes , rather than just one of them .",
    "therefore , cauchy - schwarz yields an estimate of @xmath459    furthermore , since we are assuming ( by induction ) that the hypothesis h1(@xmath391,@xmath460,@xmath461 ) holds , it follows that these @xmath423-chains are non - degenerate ( i.e. the two @xmath390-planes contained in each are distinct ) .",
    "explicitly , the degenerate @xmath390-chains which we would like to discard are simply elements of the set @xmath462 equipped with an additional pair of points , so it has size @xmath463 . applying the hypothesis h1(@xmath391,@xmath460,@xmath461 ) yields @xmath464 therefore , we have @xmath465    before preceding , we must refine the set @xmath466 to a slightly smaller set @xmath467 defined as @xmath468 making use of the uniform lower bound estimate from equation , and the fact that @xmath469 , we have @xmath470 we shall denote the elements of the set @xmath416 which are cones of @xmath423-chains from @xmath466 as @xmath471 .    next ,",
    "it is necessary to simplify the expression on the right hand side this expression . making use of equations and",
    ", we have @xmath472 holds when @xmath473 . furthermore , making use of the trivial estimate @xmath474 we arrive at an estimate of @xmath475    after repeating this procedure @xmath476 times , and making use of the trivial estimate @xmath325 , we finally arrive at the desired conclusion @xmath477    next , we shall compute a complementary upper bound for @xmath478 in two different ways ( as was done for the case @xmath400 ) .",
    "first , choose a pair @xmath432 such that @xmath479 ; there are clearly at most @xmath480 choices for this pair . by definition",
    ", the remaining @xmath481 points must lie inside @xmath309 , and they will uniquely define the remaining @xmath139 @xmath30-planes once chosen .",
    "so , once the number of ways to choose the remaining points has been computed , we will have an upper bound for @xmath478 .",
    "since @xmath482 , and these points can not cluster on low dimensional subspaces of @xmath309 , there are @xmath483 choices for the first @xmath393 points of the @xmath415-chain .",
    "next , assuming equation holds , there are at most @xmath484 choices for the @xmath417-plane found at the intersection of the @xmath171-fold intersection of the @xmath30-planes in the @xmath415 chain .",
    "this means that we have at most @xmath485 choices for the next point . finally , there are @xmath486 choices for the remaining @xmath139 points .",
    "these observations yield the bound @xmath487    next , we make the same computation , only use the cruder estimate @xmath488 instead of @xmath489 .",
    "this method yields the bound @xmath490    in order to finish the proof , we simply combine the upper and lower bounds we have now computed for @xmath491 . making use of the result from the previous computation , and the estimates and",
    ", we have @xmath492 and @xmath493 respectively .",
    "as it turns out , our main estimate is simply a convex combination of these two estimates . to be more specific ,",
    "if we define the quantity @xmath494 as @xmath495 then , one can compute that @xmath496 for appropriate values of @xmath30 and @xmath139 , and @xmath497",
    "now that we have established a lower bound on the number of simplices appearing in the configuration of points and @xmath30-planes , we must find an upper bound .",
    "this task requires making a few observations about the set @xmath249 .",
    "first of all , by construction , the pair of @xmath30-planes in any element of @xmath498 spans some affine @xmath96-dimensional space @xmath499 . since our original family of @xmath30-planes ( and hence every refinement of that family )",
    "is direction separated , we have @xmath500 for all @xmath498 .",
    "so , when constructing a simplex from some @xmath501 by choosing the remaining @xmath30 faces from @xmath499 , we have @xmath502 choices for each face .",
    "before going ahead with this construction , however , one must observe that an element @xmath498 is not merely a pair of @xmath30-planes ; each such @xmath503 comes equipped with a @xmath30-tuple of points on its `` spine '' ( the intersection of the two @xmath30-planes ) .",
    "in order to manage this technicality , recall that ( from the refined definition of @xmath242 ) , the spine of any @xmath498 must carry at least @xmath504 points from @xmath97 .",
    "so , if we delete the points from each element of @xmath249 to create the following set @xmath505 we have the following bound : @xmath506    now that we have dealt with this possible over - counting , we may construct simplices from each element @xmath507 by choosing the @xmath30 remaining faces from @xmath499 .",
    "this yields an upper bound in the number of simplices of @xmath508"
