    "the nature of galactic sources of high and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays is not clear , despite of essential progress in the theory of their acceleration and propagation . to understand the nature of sources , reliable experimental data about energy spectrum and mass composition in the range of 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 would be essential .",
    "this range includes as well the `` classical '' knee [ 1 ] at energy @xmath3 ev , as also the range of energies @xmath4 ev , considered now as maximum reachable by cosmic rays accelerated in galactic supernova remnants [ 2 ] .",
    "it is known , that the most reliable method of cosmic rays energy measurement in the specified energy range is the method of eas cherenkov light observation .",
    "a series of such experiments are carried out in tunka valley ( 50 km from lake baikal ) since more than 10 years : tunka-4 [ 3 ] , tunka-13 [ 4 ] and tunka-25 [ 5 ] .",
    "the latter array consists of 25 detectors on the basis of pmt quasar-370 and 4 detectors with pulse shape recording on the basis of pmt torn - emi d669 .",
    "to study charged particles at surface , water cherenkov detectors with an area of 10 m@xmath0 are planned to be added to the array .",
    "the detectors cover an area of @xmath5 km@xmath0 .",
    "the construction of the tunka-133 array will allow us to expand the sensitive area by almost 10 times .",
    "for one season of data taking ( 400 hours ) we plan to collect @xmath6 events with energies above 3@xmath7 ev , @xmath8 events with energies higher than @xmath9 ev , and a handful events with energies higher than @xmath10 ev .",
    "the new array will consist of 133 optical detectors on the basis of pmt emi 9350 ( diameter of photocathode of 20 cm ) .",
    "the plan of the array is shown in fig .",
    "the 133 detectors are grouped in 19 clusters of seven detectors each .",
    "the analog electronics is designed to provide a high dynamic range ( 10@xmath11 ) .",
    "the functional scheme of the cluster electronics is shown in fig .",
    "2 . the electronics will be placed inside industrial computers with isa interface .",
    "data acquisiton and management will be carried out by a single - board industrial computer pca-6145 , connected with the control center through ethernet .",
    "the measuring channels will be designed on the basis of 10-bit adcs ad9410 and xilinx microchip fpgas .",
    "the continuous digitizing of signals with step widths of 5 ns allows to discard traditional tdcs and to replace analog discriminators by digital ones .",
    "digitizing of signals at the central detector of each cluster , with steps of 2.5 ns , allows to measure the pulse form and to deduce the fwhm",
    ".    the cluster trigger condition will be @xmath12 detectors during the resolution time of 0.5 microsec",
    ". the rate of single - cluster triggers will be about 2 hz , and the cluster data stream about @xmath132 kb / sec .",
    "the reconstruction of eas parameters will be carried out with methods , developed for the tunka-25 array [ 6 ] .",
    "these methods provide an accuracy of core location of about 6 m and a primary energy resolution of about 15% .",
    "the error in @xmath14 will be about 35 g / cm@xmath0 for the ldf - steepness method , and about 25 g / cm@xmath0 for the pulse fwhm method .",
    "present work is supported by russian fund of basic researchs ( grants 02 - 02 - 17162 and 03 - 02 - 16660 ) .",
    "the pmts emi 9350 ( 200 ) have been provided by infn from the former macro experiment ."
