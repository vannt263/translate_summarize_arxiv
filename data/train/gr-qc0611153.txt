    "motion of test particles describes in an illustrative way properties of black - hole and naked - singularity spacetimes .",
    "the motion of uncharged and spinless test particles is governed by geodesic equations and directly determines the geodesic structure of the spacetimes .",
    "charged test particles can test combined gravitational and electromagnetic field of these backgrounds , their motion is determined by the lorentz equation . if the test particles possess also spin , their equations of motion are more complex in comparison with the spinless particles because of the interaction of spin with the curvature of the spacetime given by the riemann tensor @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spin dynamics has also to be considered . in the absence of an electromagnetic field of the background , the spin dynamics is determined by the fermi - walker transport equation .",
    "studies of the equilibrium positions ( equilibrium hereinafter ) of charged test particles give direct information on interplay of the gravitational and electromagnetic forces acting in the charged ( reissner - nordstrm and kerr - newman ) backgrounds @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the simplest schwarzschild backgrounds ,",
    "the equilibrium of test particles is impossible , because only the gravitational attraction is acting here .",
    "however , the presence of a repulsive cosmological constant allows the equilibrium of even uncharged particles .",
    "further , it was shown that in the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) backgrounds , the equilibrium of spinning test particles is independent of the particle spin being restricted to the static radius , where the gravitational attraction is just balanced by the cosmic repulsion @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium is spin - independent also in the reissner - nordstrm - de  sitter spacetimes @xcite .",
    "of course , the equilibrium is spin dependent in the rotating kerr spacetimes due to the interaction of the spin of the particle and the black hole @xcite .",
    "we focus onto more complicated case of stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes around rotating black holes or naked singularities in the universe with the recently indicated repulsive cosmological constant , i.e. , on kerr - de  sitter ( kds ) spacetimes , in order to extend the preliminary studies and to better understand the combined effects of the rotation of the source and the cosmic repulsion . for comparison , the restriction of our results to the pure kerr and sds spacetimes",
    "is also included .",
    "because of the complexity of general equilibrium conditions , the detailed discussion is restricted only to the cases of the equatorial plane and the symmetry axis of the spacetimes , similarly to the discussion presented in the study of equilibrium conditions in the kerr - newman spacetimes @xcite . in , properties of the kds spacetimes are summarized , and in , equations of motion of spinning particles and the spin dynamics are given .",
    "equilibrium conditions are determined and discussed in , while concluding remarks are presented in .",

    "for @xmath8 , we obtain the line element of the axially symmetric kerr geometry , while the case @xmath9 corresponds to the spherically symmetric sds geometry . using the dimensionless cosmological parameter @xmath10 and putting @xmath11 , the coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the line element @xmath14 , and the parameter @xmath7",
    "are expressed in units of @xmath6 and become dimensionless .",
    "however , the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates are not well behaved on the symmetry axis and can not be used for establishing of the equilibrium conditions in this special case .",
    "therefore we also use the kerr - schild coordinates introduced by the transformation @xmath15 note that in the following discussion , some characteristic functions appear . as for the notation ,",
    "the functions involving the variable @xmath13 are derived and related to the equatorial plane , while functions involving the variable @xmath16 are valid for the symmetry axis .",
    "the stationary regions of the kds spacetimes , determined by the relation @xmath17 , are limited by the inner and outer black - hole horizons at @xmath18 and @xmath19 and by the cosmological horizon at @xmath20 .",
    "spacetimes containing three horizons are black - hole ( bh ) spacetimes , while spacetimes containing one horizon ( the cosmological horizon exists for any choice of the spacetime parameters ) are naked - singularity ( ns ) spacetimes @xcite .    for given values of the spacetime parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the radii of the horizons are , due to the relation @xmath23 , determined by solutions of the equation @xmath24 for a fixed value of @xmath22 , the number of solutions of this equation ( horizons ) depends on the number of positive local extrema of the function @xmath25 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the extrema are located at the radii implicitly determined ( due to the condition @xmath26 ) by the relation @xmath27 whereas the maximum of the function @xmath28 is located at @xmath29 and takes the critical value @xmath30 .",
    "the behaviour of the function @xmath25 can be summarized in the following way    * @xmath31 , there are two local extrema of the function @xmath25 , denoted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 and determined by the relations ( [ k6 ] ) and ( [ k6a ] ) , whereas the local minimum @xmath33 becomes positive ( relevant ) for @xmath34 . thus for @xmath35 or for @xmath36 , there is one solution of the equation ( [ k6 ] ) and only ns spacetimes exist . for @xmath37 and @xmath38",

    "the vertical dotted lines denote positions of the static radii in the equatorial plane and the vertical dashed line denotes the position of the static limit surface in the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetimes .",

    ".    the discussion of the position of the horizons is @xmath50-independent , i.e. , it is valid also for the symmetry axis .",
    "the horizons on the symmetry axis are then determined by the equation @xmath51 arriving from the relation ( [ k6a ] ) simply after replacing @xmath13 by @xmath16 . restricting here and hereafter to the positive values of @xmath16",

    "due to the repulsive cosmological constant and the rotation of the source , the kds spacetimes enable existence of the so - called static radii , where the `` free '' spinless particles can `` stay at rest '' .",
    "a detailed discussion of the properties and astrophysical relevance of the static radii can be found in @xcite . apparently , these radii are defined by the ( [ 11 ] ) and the equation of motion ( [ 7 ] ) , reduced to the geodesic equation in this case .    in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the static radius is located at @xmath52 where the gravitational attraction is balanced by the cosmological repulsion independently of the rotational parameter @xmath7 .",
    "it plays important role in the geodetical structure of the spacetimes @xcite and even relates to the equilibrium of spinning test particles .    on the symmetry axis , there are at most two static radii dependent on both spacetime parameters @xmath7 and @xmath22 . for given values of the parameters ,",
    "the static radii are implicitly determined by solutions of the equation @xmath53 there is always one maximum of the function located at @xmath54 taking the value @xmath55 note that the static radii on the axis are relevant for our discussion only in the stationary regions of the spacetimes as well as in the case of the equatorial plane . then finding the common points of the functions @xmath45 and @xmath56 at the extrema of the function @xmath56 and summarizing other behaviour of the functions ,",
