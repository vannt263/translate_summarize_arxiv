    "such states can not be described by the ce , because its defining feature is that it makes the subsystems uncorrelated . in an aggregate of many subsystems ,",

    "<S> stars form when cold cosmic nebulae spontaneously develop hot spots that steadily intensify until they reach fusion temperatures @xcite . without this process , the universe would be dark and dead . yet the spontaneous concentration of heat is exactly what the second law of thermodynamics is in most cases supposed to forbid . the formation of protostars has been much discussed @xcite , for its consistency with the second law depends on a thermodynamical property that is common in systems whose strongest force is their own gravity , but otherwise very rare : negative specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> negative specific heat turns the world upside down , thermodynamically ; it implies that entropy increases when energy flows from lower to higher energy subsystems , opposite to the usual direction . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have reported negative specific heat in melting atomic clusters @xcite and fragmenting nuclei @xcite , but these arguably represent transient phenomena outside the proper scope of thermodynamics . here we show that the counter - intuitive thermodynamics of spontaneous energy concentration can be studied experimentally with trapped quantum gases , by using optical lattice potentials @xcite to realize weakly coupled arrays of simple dynamical subsystems that share the peculiar property of self - gravitating protostars , of having negative micro - canonical specific heat </S>",
    "<S> . numerical solution of real - time evolution equations confirms the spontaneous concentration of energy in such arrays , with initially dispersed energy condensing quickly into dense ` droplets ' . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose laboratory studies of negative specific heat as an elusive but fundamentally important aspect of thermodynamics , which may shed fresh light on the general problem of how thermodynamics emerges from mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> the second law of thermodynamics says that entropy can not decrease , which is often summarized by saying that heat can not flow from colder systems to hotter . </S>",
    "<S> this summary is exact if hotter and colder are interpreted as higher and lower temperature , but it is not necessarily valid in reference to systems containing more or less energy . </S>",
    "<S> the rate at which temperature changes with energy  the _ specific heat _ @xmath0  is normally positive , so that higher temperature implies higher energy , and heat flow from high to low temperature redistributes energy more evenly throughout aggregate systems , tending towards uniform equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 should be negative , however , then higher temperature corresponds to _ lower _ energy , and increasing entropy requires that systems with less energy lose heat to systems with more energy . in aggregates of many subsystems , </S>",
    "<S> negative @xmath0 thus implies instability toward spontaneous energy concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this would fit the pattern seen in star formation , but that does not prove that the thermodynamic explanation of star formation can only be negative @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is debated whether or under which circumstances negative @xmath0 is really possible @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some classic thermodynamics texts state flatly that systems with negative @xmath0 can not exist @xcite , while others discuss the issue at more cautious length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact thermodynamics does not prescribe such features of any system . </S>",
    "<S> it is the discipline of statistical mechanics that strives to predict them , by representing the effect of complex mechanical interactions in terms of probability distributions , and identifying statistical properties of these distributions with thermodynamical quantities like @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the workhorse probability distribution of statistical mechanics , the so - called canonical ensemble ( ce ) , negative @xmath0 is indeed impossible for any system : @xmath1 where the averages @xmath2 are taken in the canonical ensemble ( see supplementary material ) </S>",
    "<S> . this theorem does not hold , however , in the alternative probability distribution of the micro - canonical ensemble ( @xmath3c ) , in which the system s energy is fixed , rather than fluctuating randomly as in the ce . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that the canonical ensemble is invalid whenever the micro - canonical ensemble yields negative @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies between ensembles point to the fact that statistical mechanics remains a comparatively weak link in the chain of physics .    </S>",
    "<S> it is nonetheless a tremendously important link . </S>",
    "<S> statistical mechanics gives physics much of its power , by connecting simple models to complex reality , and its predictions are amply verified in many cases . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on falsifiable assumptions , however , and these can be tested today as never before , with experiments on tightly controlled mesoscopic systems whose dynamics can be followed closely enough for direct comparison with the statistical theory . trapped quantum gases </S>",

    "<S> the observation of bose - einstein condensation was a scientific landmark because it confirmed one dramatic prediction of statistical mechanics , the cessation of thermal motion by a large fraction of gas atoms at a temperature above absolute zero . </S>",
    "<S> can trapped quantum gases test another dramatic statistical mechanical prediction , spontaneous energy concentration as in star formation , by realizing an aggregate of systems with negative specific heat ?    they can . the two - mode bose - hubbard ( bh ) model with repulsive interactions has been highly studied as a model system , representing bosonic particles that quantum mechanically tunnel back and forth between two potential wells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been realized as such in experiments @xcite . in the formalism of so - called second quantization , where the canonical operators @xmath4 remove atoms from wells 1 and 2 , and their conjugate operators @xmath5 replace the atoms correspondingly </S>",
    "<S> , the hamiltonian of a single two - mode bh system reads @xmath6 for repulsively interacting trapped bosons , the constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 are determined by the details of the trapping potential and of interparticle scattering , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath17 must be chosen great enough for @xmath14 to be large and relatively smooth as a function of @xmath18 , but small enough for @xmath14 to be linearly proportional to @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 becomes independent of @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - mode bh spectrum becomes dense in the limit of large total boson number @xmath9 , which is also the regime most easily attained in experiments , and in this semiclassical limit the eigenspectrum is given accurately , except for classical orbits too near an unstable fixed point , by bohr - sommerfeld quantization . </S>",
    "<S> this involves constructing canonical action - angle variables @xmath20 for the quantum system s classical analogue , expressing the classical hamiltonian @xmath21 as @xmath22 , and then determining the quantum eigenenergies as @xmath23 for @xmath24 a whole number . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of a dense spectrum is obtained for large @xmath9 , and implies @xmath25 . for the classical analogue of @xmath11 the derivative @xmath26 may be calculated analytically in closed form ( see the supplementary material ) , yielding the entropy @xmath27}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon r(e / e_{\\mathrm{max}},\\varepsilon)}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , and we define the functions @xmath29/r(\\mathcal{e},\\varepsilon ) } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 denotes the highest energy of the classical system for fixed @xmath9 , so that @xmath31 is the normalized energy . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy turns out only to depend on @xmath9 and @xmath32 by depending on @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in this sense the two - mode bh entropy is non - extensive with particle number @xmath9 , but this should not be surprising , since what is expected is extensivity in the number of two - mode systems that are coupled together in a large aggregate system . ) </S>",
