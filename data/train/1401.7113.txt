    "a classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway event on a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary .",
    "a companion star transfers its mass to the wd via roche - lobe overflow or a wind .",
    "when the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the wd reaches a critical value , hydrogen at the bottom of the envelope ignites to trigger a hydrogen shell - flash and the binary becomes a nova .",
    "the photospheric radius of the wd envelope expands to a giant size and the spectrum of the nova resembles that of an f - supergiant at or near optical maximum . after optical maximum , the photosphere recedes into progressively deeper layers as the envelope mass decreases , mainly because of wind mass - loss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the wind mass - loss rate gradually decreases , and optically - thick winds finally stop before the nova enters a supersoft x - ray phase .",
    "the nova outburst ends when the hydrogen shell burning extinguishes .",
    "this nova envelope evolution was calculated by @xcite on the basis of the optically - thick nova wind theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    despite their overall similarity ,",
    "the optical light curves of novae have a wide variety of timescales and shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure [ light_curve_pu_vul_hr_del_fh_ser_pw_vul_v1668_cyg_v1500_cyg ] ) .",
    "various empirical time - scaling laws have been proposed in an attempt to recognize common patterns and unify the nova light curves ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a summary ) .",
    "recently , @xcite found that , in terms of free - free emission , the optical and infrared ( ir ) light curves of several novae follow a similar decline law .",
    "moreover , the time - normalized light curves were found to be independent of the wd mass , chemical composition of the ejecta , and wavelength .",
    "they called this the universal decline law .",
    "subsequently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite applied this universal decline law to a number of novae ( @xmath7 novae ) . on the basis of this universal decline law",
    ", @xcite theoretically explained the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline ( mmrd ) law of classical novae .",
    "therefore , we confidently state that the main part of nova light curves can be interpreted in terms of free - free emission from nova ejecta outside the photosphere .",
    "the evolution of colors is another challenging subject that attracts many researchers , who have attempted to identify common behavior among various types of novae .",
    "for example , @xcite noted that the color evolutions of six novae are remarkably similar in the intrinsic @xmath8 versus @xmath9 color - color diagram , regardless of their different nova speed classes .",
    "these six novae , however , traced similar but different paths in the color - color diagram ( see figures 27 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite derived the general trends of color evolution in nova light curves , i.e. , @xmath10 at maximum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for an earlier work ) and @xmath11 at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 or 3 ) is the number of days during which a nova decays by the @xmath15-th magnitude from its optical maximum , and @xmath8 is the intrinsic @xmath0 color of the nova .",
    "these two relations , however , often show large deviations from the values obtained by other methods .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 color evolution of novae stabilizes soon after optical maximum and that this stage showed a general trend of @xmath16 .",
    "he derived the extinctions , @xmath17 , of 23 novae assuming that all of them have the same @xmath8 color at the stabilization stage , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the observed @xmath0 color at the stabilization stage .",
    "this method looks powerful but sometimes results in a large difference from the true value .",
    "( we will discuss this in more detail in section [ discussion ] . )    according to hachisu & kato s ( 2006 ) universal decline law , the optical fluxes in the @xmath20 bands could be dominated by free - free emission . if this is the case , the color is simply estimated to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the optically - thin free - free emission ( @xmath23 ) , or to be @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 for the optically - thick free - free emission ( @xmath26 , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath27 is the flux at the frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the latter value of @xmath24 is close to @xmath11 at @xmath12 derived by @xcite .",
    "however , many novae do not remain at these pivot points but evolve further blueward .",
    "these different trends in nova color evolution may represent different sides of the true color evolution , which we do not yet fully understand observationally or theoretically .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find a general path of nova color evolution , as @xcite tried to do 30 yr ago .",
    "first , in section [ fh_ser_color ] we analyze the moderately - fast nova fh  ser in the @xmath8 - @xmath9 diagram and find a new sequence along which novae evolve when the photospheric emission dominates the optical spectrum .",
    "we call this new sequence `` the nova - giant sequence '' after the supergiant sequence .",
    "then we examine the color evolution of slow and fast novae , pw  vul , v1500  cyg , v1668  cyg , and v1974  cyg , in section [ free_free_color_evolution ] . in section [ pu_vul ] , we apply the tracks of color - color evolution to pu  vul and find that the tracks of color - color evolution of the slow / fast novae are common to this symbiotic nova . in section [ each_slow_novae ] , we examine two very slow novae , hr  del and v723  cas , and show that the tracks of the color - color evolution are also common .",
    "thus , we found that the overall trends in the color - color evolution are very similar to each other .",
    "therefore , we propose a general course of nova outbursts in the color - color diagram for all speed classes of novae . in section [ extinction_novae ] , we redetermine the reddening of novae by fitting the color evolution of a target nova with the general course of color evolution in the color - color diagram . in this way , we propose a new method for estimating the color excess .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in sections [ discussion ] and [ conclusions ] , respectively . in the appendix , we estimate the absolute magnitudes of about 30 novae , using the time - stretching method for nova light curves proposed by @xcite to analyze the distance - reddening relation of each nova .",
    "the first example that we analyze is the moderately - fast nova fh  ser .",
    "fh  ser showed a gradual optical decay with @xmath29 and @xmath30 days @xcite followed by a sudden drop in brightness about 2.8 mag below the optical maximum due to dust shell formation .",
    "the @xmath6 light curve is shown in figure [ light_curve_pu_vul_hr_del_fh_ser_pw_vul_v1668_cyg_v1500_cyg ] on a linear timescale and the @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 light curves of fh  ser are shown in figure [ dq_her_fh_ser_light_v_bv_ub_logscale ] on a logarithmic timescale , where the @xmath20 data are taken from ( * ? ? ?",

    "* blue open diamonds ) .",
    "the @xmath0 color of @xcite is systematically @xmath31  mag bluer than the others whereas their @xmath6 and @xmath1 data are reasonably consistent with those of the other groups .",
    "therefore , we shifted borra & andersen s @xmath0 data down by 0.2 mag .",
    "@xcite obtained a value of @xmath32 for the reddening toward fh  ser using the mmrd relation and interstellar reddening relation . @xcite",
    "obtained @xmath33 from the color at optical maximum ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 from the line ratio of h@xmath36h@xmath37 , and @xmath38 from the equivalent width of @xmath39 .",
    "then , @xcite adopted an averaged value of @xmath40 .",
    "because kodaira s @xmath41 and della valle et al.s @xmath35 coincide , we use @xmath41 in this paper and confirm below that this value is reasonable .    the distance toward fh  ser",
    "was estimated to be @xmath42  kpc by @xcite , and to be @xmath43  kpc by @xcite both from the expansion parallax method .",
    "we obtained fh  ser s distance modulus by comparing its brightness with that of dq  her .",
    "the trigonometric parallax distance of dq  her was obtained by @xcite as @xmath44  pc .",
    "adopting @xmath45 @xcite , we obtain the distance modulus of dq  her as @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we used @xmath47 for dq  her , figure [ dq_her_fh_ser_light_v_bv_ub_logscale](a ) shows that the light curves of fh  ser and dq  her overlap each other in the final decline phase with a brightness difference of @xmath48 . because the timescales of these two novae are almost the same",
    ", we may consider that the brightness itself should be almost the same .",

    "when winds began to blow , the configuration of the envelope changed from that in figure [ wind_config6ab_premax_no3](b ) to that in figure [ wind_config6ab_premax_no3](c ) .",
    "then , the balmer jump became shallower ( see the spectrum in figure 6 of * ? ? ? * ) and was filled with emission lines .",
    "thus , the spectrum is approaching that of a blackbody or free - free emission .",
    "the resultant @xmath9 color becomes bluer to approach that of a blackbody or free - free emission .    to understand this property",
    ", we analyze the nova spectra from ut 1989 april 8 , in the nebular phase ( stage 4 ) .",
    "we assume that the spectrum is a summation of the blackbody emission at the photospheric temperature @xmath108 and optically thick free - free emission at the electron temperature of @xmath109 , i.e. , equation ( [ wind_spectrum_combination ] ) .",
    "figures [ sed_pu_vul_iue_ubv_free_free_bb ] shows the broad band spectrum of pu  vul , a combination of _ iue _ spectra of swp35966 and lwp15323 taken from the ines archive data sever and optical @xmath20 fluxes observed on ut 1989 april 8 @xcite . assuming that @xmath124 , we changed @xmath112 in 500  k steps and obtained a temperature of @xmath245  k. this is roughly consistent with the photospheric temperature of @xmath246  k theoretically calculated by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ sed_pu_vul_iue_ubv_free_free_bb ] , we need a free - free emission component to fit the spectrum although its contribution is rather small at the @xmath20 bands .",
    "the slope of the resultant spectrum at the @xmath20 bands is very close to that of optically - thin free - free emission ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "this explains why the position of stage 4 is close to both the blackbody sequence and optically - thin , free - free emission , i.e. , point 0 in figure [ color_color_diagram_pu_vul_points_postmax ] .      in the color - color diagram of figure [ color_color_diagram_pu_vul_points_postmax ]",
    ", pu  vul further evolves blueward from point 4 to 5 ( stage 4 to 5 ) while maintaining an almost constant @xmath9 .",
    "this blueward change is mainly due to the growth of strong emission lines , especially in the @xmath91 and @xmath129 bands , as already explained in section [ emission_lines_effect ] .",
    "figure [ skopal_emission_effect ] shows the effect of strong emission lines , i.e. , @xmath134 and @xmath248 , in the color - color diagram . among the seven stars in figure [ skopal_emission_effect ] , six are symbiotic stars and three are symbiotic novae .",
    "symbiotic novae can be divided into two groups according to their spectral evolution .",
    "the first group exhibits a long ( several years ) `` supergiant phase , '' in which they resemble an a  f supergiant while the star undergoes a nova outburst . in the second group ,",
    "a nebular phase begins almost immediately after optical maximum , and a `` supergiant phase , '' if there is one , has a very short duration @xcite .",
    "the first group includes pu  vul , rr  tel , ag  peg , and rt  ser .",
    "the second group includes v1016 cyg , hbv 475 , and hm sge . because pu  vul is not included in @xcite , we highlight rr  tel in figure [ skopal_emission_effect ] because it belongs to the same group as pu  vul and its spectral evolution is similar to that of pu  vul .",
    "it is very clear that the blueward excursion in the color - color diagram is due to emission lines , because the position moves almost horizontally by @xmath249 .",
    "thus , we specify the color - color evolution of pu  vul by points 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( `` pu  vul template '' ) . these points are tabulated in table [ intrinsic_two_color_selected ] . here",
    "we stop following the color evolution when the @xmath6 magnitude drops by about 3 mag from the maximum because strong emission lines make increasingly large contributions to the colors , and their effects cloud the overall color evolution",
    ".    it may be surprising that the color - color evolution of pu  vul follows almost the same tracks as those of slow / moderately fast / fast novae .",
    "this is because the physics of emission ( figure [ wind_config6ab_premax_no3 ] ) is common among these novae regardless of the speed class or light curve shape . in a classical nova ,",
    "the evolution is very fast , and it quickly passes stages ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ wind_config6ab_premax_no3 ] and enters the optically thick wind phase ( c ) . on the other hand , in pu  vul ,",
    "the optically - thick winds were not accelerated and it slowly evolved from stages ( a ) to ( b ) and then entered the optically - thin wind phase . in the next section , we further show that very slow novae also follow this common track in color - color evolution .",
    "in this section , we examine the color evolutions of three very slow novae , hr  del , v723  cas , and v5558  sgr .",
    "they have similar light curves ( see figure [ light_curve_v723_cas_hr_del_v5558_sgr ] ) and spectral evolutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hr  del , v723  cas , and v5558  sgr show multiple peaks in their light curves , as shown in figure [ light_curve_v723_cas_hr_del_v5558_sgr ] , whereas pu  vul shows a smooth light curve with a flat maximum phase except for the eclipses .",
    "@xcite proposed the concept of multiple solutions of novae as an explanation for such multipeak structures in the optical light curves .",
    "they pointed out that there are two different types of nova evolution ; one is evolution with optically - thick winds for @xmath250 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the other is that without them for @xmath251 .",
    "both types can be realized in slow novae in a certain range of wd masses , @xmath252 .",
    "for example , the evolution of gq mus 1983 is explained by a sequence of optically - thick wind solutions on a @xmath253 wd @xcite , whereas the evolution of pu vul 1979 is described by a sequence of hydrostatic solutions on a @xmath254 wd @xcite .",
    "these two evolutions show a remarkable difference in the optical light curves . in a wind - type nova ,",
    "massive optically - thick winds carry away a large part of the envelope , producing a quick decay of the light curve .",
    "thus , the optical light curve of the nova shows a sharp peak . on the other hand , in low mass wds",
    "no optically - thick winds are accelerated , so the nova evolves very slowly and retains an extended photosphere with low temperatures for a long time , which produces a long lasting flat optical peak before the magnitude slowly decays as in pu  vul .",
    "@xcite explained theoretically that the transition from static evolution to wind evolution could occur during an outburst .",
    "in such a case , the nova shows a flat optical peak with no indication of strong mass loss in the early phase of the outburst , like pu  vul , followed by a quick decay phase , as in normal novae with strong optically - thick winds .",
    "they further suggested that such a transition from a static to a wind structure is accompanied by behavior such as oscillations in the brightness , because the internal structures of the static / wind solutions differ greatly , and a relaxation process in the transition should induce some oscillatory features .",
    "they suggested that the light curve behaviors of hr  del , v723  cas , and v5558  sgr in figure [ light_curve_v723_cas_hr_del_v5558_sgr ] correspond to this type of transition .",
    "@xcite proposed the following transition mechanism : the static evolution itself is stable , as seen in the 8-yr flat peak of pu  vul ( figures [ light_curve_pu_vul_hr_del_fh_ser_pw_vul_v1668_cyg_v1500_cyg ] and [ v723_cas_pu_vul_light_simple ] ) . in close binaries ,",
    "however , the envelope structures are affected because of the effect of a companion star s gravity , which may trigger the transition . for pu  vul ( @xmath255 days ) , however , the transition was not triggered because its companion star is far outside the photosphere of the bloated wd envelope . for hr",
    "del ( @xmath256 days ) , v723  cas ( @xmath257 days ) , and v5558  sgr ( @xmath258 unknown ) , their outbursts started as static evolution , but their transitions were triggered a few hundred days after the outburst , owing to the effect of the companion located deep in the nova envelope . if this is the case , these three novae should exhibit not only similar light curve evolution but also similar color evolution . in this section",
    "we first examine the distances and absorptions of these three novae to obtain the dereddened colors and then discuss the color evolution of these three very slow novae .",
    "first , we examine the absolute magnitude of these very slow novae . as already explained in section [ transition_from_static_to_wind ] , @xcite modeled the pre - maximum phase of these very slow novae with a static evolution followed by the transition from a static to a wind structure .",
    "they predicted that this transition occurs in a narrow range of wd masses , @xmath259 .",
    "thus , the brightness at the pre - maximum phase is similar to that of pu  vul ( @xmath232 ) , i.e. , @xmath260 in stage 1 and @xmath261 in stage 2 .",
    "we apply these two absolute magnitudes of pu  vul to the @xmath6 light curves of the three novae . because these light curves show oscillatory behavior , it is not easy to define the stages corresponding to stages 1 and 2 in pu  vul .",
    "however , we finally found reasonable fittings , as shown in figure [ light_curve_v723_cas_hr_del_v5558_sgr ] .",
    "thus , we obtained a distance modulus of @xmath262 , 14.0 , and 13.9 for hr  del , v723  cas , and v5558  sgr , respectively .",
    "we confirmed and calibrated the distance moduli of these three novae obtained above by comparing their light curves with that of rr  pic , because the distance to rr  pic was recently obtained using trigonometric parallax , i.e. , @xmath263  pc @xcite .",
    "the distance modulus of rr  pic is calculated to be @xmath264 , where we used @xmath265 after @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 light curve of rr  pic is plotted in figure [ v723_cas_hr_del_v5558_sgr_rr_pic_ub_bv_color_light_curve_revised ] on a linear timescale and in figure [ v723_cas_hr_del_v5558_sgr_ub_bv_color_light_curve_revised_logscale ] on a logarithmic timescale with those of hr  del , v723  cas , and v5558  sgr .",
    "we shifted the @xmath6 light curves of rr  pic , v5558  sgr , and hr  del vertically so that they overlap that of v723  cas .",
    "the light curve of rr  pic is very similar to those of these three novae , so rr  pic belongs to the same type of novae as hr  del , v723  cas , and v5558  sgr , although the very early ( rising ) phase of rr  pic was not observed .",
    "because these four novae have almost the same timescale of decline , we simply assumed that their brightnesses are all the same .",
    "the difference in @xmath6 magnitude compared to v723  cas is @xmath266 for rr  pic , @xmath267 for hr  del , and @xmath268 for v5558  sgr .",

    "the general tracks of nova outbursts consist mainly of three branches , i.e. , the nova - giant sequence phase and free - free emission ( point f ) phase , followed by development of strong emission lines ( horizontal blueward excursion ) : ( 1 ) in the early phase of a nova outburst , i.e. , in the pre - maximum phase , a nova evolves from near the blackbody sequence and follows a new sequence redward .",
    "after optical maximum , the nova quickly evolves back blueward along this new sequence .",
    "this new sequence is located parallel to , but @xmath2 mag bluer than , the supergiant sequence .",
    "we call the new sequence `` the nova - giant sequence '' after the supergiant sequence",
    ". the spectra of novae on the nova - giant sequence resemble those of a ",
    "f type supergiants .",
    "( 2 ) subsequently , the spectra of novae become that of free - free emission in the optical and near ir regions . therefore , novae stay at the point of free - free emission ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) for a while .",
    "thus , we call this point `` point f '' in the color - color diagram after free - free emission .",
    "( 3 ) after this stage , novae evolve leftward ( blueward in @xmath0 but almost constant in @xmath1 ) mainly because of the development of strong emission lines . in this work",
    ", we stopped following the color evolution when the @xmath6 magnitude drops by 3  4 mag from the maximum because strong emission lines make an increasingly large contribution to the @xmath9 and @xmath8 colors , and their effects cloud the overall evolution of colors .",

    "the latter two values in the third and fifth lines of equation ( [ v1500_cyg_distance_mod ] ) agree very well with our distance modulus in the first line of equation ( [ v1500_cyg_distance_mod ] ) presented in section [ v1500_cyg ] .",
    "moreover , the mutual agreement in the two novae with their known trigonometric distances indicates that the time - stretching method is reliable .",

    "<S> f supergiants near optical light maximum . however , they do not follow the supergiant sequence in the color - color diagram , neither the blackbody nor the main - sequence sequence . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we found that novae evolve along a new sequence in the pre - maximum and near - maximum phases , which we call `` the nova - giant sequence . '' </S>",
    "<S> this sequence is parallel to but @xmath2 mag bluer than the supergiant sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the mass of a nova envelope is much ( @xmath3 times ) less than that of a normal supergiant . </S>",
    "<S> after optical maximum , its color quickly evolves back blueward along the same nova - giant sequence and reaches the point of free - free emission ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , which coincides with the intersection of the blackbody sequence and the nova - giant sequence , and remains there for a while . </S>",
    "<S> then the color evolves leftward ( blueward in @xmath0 but almost constant in @xmath1 ) , owing mainly to the development of strong emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> this is the general course of nova outbursts in the color - color diagram , which was deduced from eight well - observed novae in various speed classes . for a nova with unknown extinction </S>",
    "<S> , we can determine a reliable value of the color excess by matching the observed track of the target nova with this general course . </S>",
    "<S> this is a new and convenient method for obtaining the color excesses of classical novae . using this method , we redetermined the color excesses of 20 well - observed novae . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained color excesses are in reasonable agreement with the previous results , which in turn support the idea of our general track of nova outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we estimated the absolute @xmath6 magnitudes of about 30 novae using a method for time - stretching nova light curves to analyze the distance - reddening relations of the novae . </S>"
