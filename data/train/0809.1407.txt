    "events with a @xmath0  or @xmath1  boson and one or more light flavor jets are relatively common at the tevatron .",

    "@xmath6  events are selected by identifying a high @xmath7 , central electron along with significant missing transverse energy , @xmath8 ; @xmath9  events are selected by requiring one such electron with another that is either central or in the forward region of the calorimeter , with the invariant mass of the electron pair required to be near the @xmath1  mass peak .",
    "events are then assigned to bins of minimum jet multiplicity .",
    "major sources of background in the @xmath0+jets analysis include events with fake @xmath0 s and electroweak sources ( @xmath10 , single top , dibosons ) ; backgrounds in the @xmath1+jets analysis are dominated by multijet production and @xmath0+jets events in which the @xmath1  signal is faked .",

    "[ fig : wjets ] one can see that the lo prediction consisting of the matrix element calculation from madgraph  @xcite , parton shower from pythia  @xcite and matching scheme from ckkw  @xcite is superior to that of alpgen + herwig shower + mlm - matching  @xcite .",
