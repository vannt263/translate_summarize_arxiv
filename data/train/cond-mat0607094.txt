    "quantum interference effects in quantum wires ( qws ) are potentially useful in nanotechnology since coupling to the continuum states shows an even - odd parity effect in the conductance when the fermi energy is localized at the center of the energy band  @xcite .",
    "consequently , a fine control of the electron transport can be achieved by varying the external parameters of the qw .    in this context , we have recently considered new quantum devices based on an array of quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite , a double qd  @xcite and nanorings @xcite coupled to a qw .",
    "the attached device acts as scatterer for electron transmission through the qw and allows to tune its transport properties .",
    "it was found that the conductance at zero temperature through the qw shows a complex behavior as a function of the fermi energy : far from the center of the band the conductance depends smoothly on the fermi energy , while around the center it develops an oscillating band with resonances and antiresonances due to quantum interference in the ballistic channel .",
    "moreover , the transmission phase of the electron carries information complementary to the transmission probability .",
    "this phase has been measured in qds  @xcite and recently it was reported  @xcite the experimental observation of the fano - kondo antiresonance in a qw with a side - coupled qd .",
    "these experiments proved that transport through the system has a coherent component .    in this work",
    "we report further progress along the lines indicated above .",
    "in particular , we study theoretically transport properties of a set of side - coupled double qds attached to a perfect qw . we find an analytical expression for the transmission probability and transmission phase .",
    "the transmission probability at the center of the energy spectrum shows an energy spectrum with gap or allowed band depending of the symmetry up - down , to be explained below . in a symmetry",
    "up - down , an even - odd parity effect in the transmission phase at the center of the band is demonstrated .",
    "moreover , we show that an allowed band is formed in the asymmetric case and that the width of this band can be controlled by suitable gate voltages .",
    "this phenomenon is in analogy to the dicke effect in quantum optics , that takes place in the spontaneous emission of two closely - lying atoms radiating a photon into the same environment  @xcite . in the electronic case , however , the decay rates ( level broadening ) are produced by the indirect coupling of the up - down qds , giving rise to a fast ( _ superradiant _ ) and a slow ( _ subradiant _ ) mode .",
    "this close analogy opens the way to exploit new electronic effects that usually arise in atomic physics . in this regard",
    ", it has been shown that coupled qds display the electronic counterpart of fano and dicke effects that can be controled via a magnetic flux  @xcite .",
    "recently , brandes reviewed the dicke effect in mesoscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "the system under consideration is shown in fig .",
    "the qw is attached to a @xmath0 side - coupled double qds .",
    "the system , assumed in equilibrium , is modeled by a noninteracting anderson tunneling hamiltonian  @xcite that can be written as @xmath1 , where    @xmath2    describes the dynamics of the qw , @xmath3 being the hopping between neighbor sites of the qw , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath6 .     side - coupled double qds attached to a perfect qw.,width=226 ]    on the other side , @xmath7 , given by @xmath8 is the hamiltonian for the @xmath0 side - coupled double qds , where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron in the qd ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the corresponding single energy level . here",
    "the index @xmath13 refers to the up ( @xmath14 ) and down ( @xmath15 ) qd , attached at site @xmath16 of the qw .",
    "the coupling between the two subsystems ( qw and qds ) is described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coupling between the qw and one of the qds .",
    "the hamiltonian for the qw , @xmath19 , corresponds to a free - particle hamiltonian on a lattice with spacing unity and whose eigenfunctions are expressed as bloch solutions    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the momentum eigenstate and @xmath22 is a wannier state localized at site @xmath16 .",
    "the dispersion relation associated with these bloch states reads @xmath23 consequently , the hamiltonian supports an energy band from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and the first brillouin zone expands the interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the stationary states of the entire hamiltonian @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where the coefficient @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the probability amplitude to find the electron at site @xmath16 of the qw [ at the qd @xmath31 ) ] in the state @xmath32 , that is , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath29 obey the following linear difference equation    @xmath35    the amplitudes @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 as follows    @xmath37    from eq .",
    "( [ bj - aj ] ) above , eq .",
    "( [ eq - aj ] ) becomes @xmath38 where the site energy @xmath39 $ ] depends on the electron energy @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the problem reduces to a linear chain of a @xmath0 sites of effective energies @xmath41 . in order to study the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ newdif2 ] ) , we assume that the electrons are described by a plane wave incident from the far left with unity amplitude and a reflection amplitude @xmath42 , and at the far right by a transmission amplitude @xmath43 .",
    "that is , @xmath44    the solution in the region @xmath45 can be written as    @xmath46\\ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "a_{j}^{(k ) }   &   = ce^{\\kappa j}+de^{-\\kappa j}\\ , & \\text{if } \\left\\vert ( \\omega-\\tilde{\\varepsilon})/2v\\right\\vert   &   > 1\\ , \\quad \\kappa=-\\cosh^{-1 } \\left[-(\\omega-\\tilde{\\varepsilon})/2v\\right ] \\ . \\label{solut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    inserting  ( [ solut2 ] ) and  ( [ solut ] ) into  ( [ newdif2 ] ) , we get a inhomogeneous system of linear equations for @xmath47 and @xmath42 , leading to the following result : if @xmath48 ,    @xmath49    with @xmath50 given by @xmath51 on the contrary , when @xmath52 @xmath53 with @xmath50 given by @xmath54    the transmission probability is given by @xmath55 , and it is related to the linear conductance at the fermi energy @xmath56 by the one - channel landauer formula at zero temperature , @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "we also can obtain the transmission phase as @xmath58 .",
    "to uncover the main features of the electron transport through the qw and the effects of the attached qds , we now consider several physical situations . if @xmath59 , the transmission probability and transmission phase reduces to    @xmath60    with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the transmission probability oscillates as a function of both @xmath0 and @xmath63 . on the other hand , when @xmath64 we get @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , in this energy region @xmath0 tends exponentially to zero when @xmath0 is large , namely @xmath68 .    to avoid the profusion of free parameters , for the sake of clarity we set the energies of the up and down qds as , @xmath69 and @xmath70 hereafter .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the transmission exhibits a forbidden band ( gap ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the transmission probability versus @xmath40 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath72 tends to zero within a range @xmath73 $ ] , with @xmath74 , and the system shows a gap of width @xmath75 .    inside the energy region @xmath73 $ ] the conductance does not present any feature that depends on @xmath0 .",
    "however , at the center of the band ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) the transmission phase takes on the following values , depending on the parity of @xmath0 : when @xmath0 is odd , @xmath79 for @xmath80 , while for @xmath0 even , @xmath81 for @xmath82",
    ". we can understand this result as follows .",
    "each time that the electron passes near a double qds , it undergoes a phase change equal to @xmath83 due to the destructive interference between the discrete levels in the double qd and the continuum states of the qw .",
    "consider now the situation with @xmath84 .",
    "figure  ( [ fig3 ] ) shows the transmission probability for different values of @xmath85 , for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we note that an allowed band develops at the center of the gap .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for @xmath88 the width of this allowed band is @xmath89 .",
    "moreover the transmission probability becomes always unity at the center of the allowed band , independently of the value of @xmath90    figure  [ fig4 ] displays the transmission probability for several values of @xmath85 when @xmath86 ( solid line ) and @xmath87 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we note that the shape of the allowed band is independent of the value of @xmath85 .",
    "additionally , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the transmission phase for a similar set of parameters in the region of the allowed band .",
    "we note a series of discontinuities of the transmission phase at some values of the energy @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth to note that the drops in the transmission phase do not imply vanishing transmission probability . at the energies of the drops of the transmission phase , the real part of the transmission amplitude vanishes and at the same time its imaginary part changes its sign .",
    "additionally from eq.([phase1 ] ) , we obtain that the transmission phase is zero ( or @xmath91 , @xmath92 integer ) at the center of the allowed band , independent of the value of @xmath0 and @xmath85 . at the same time",
    ", the transmission probability becomes unity .",
    "this phenomenon resembles the dicke effect in optics , which takes place in the spontaneous emission of a pair of atoms radiating a photon with a wave length much larger than the separation between them  @xcite .",
    "the luminescence spectrum is characterized by a narrow and a broad peak , associated with long and short - lived states , respectively .",
    "the former state , weakly coupled to the electromagnetic field , is called _ subradiant _ , and the latter , strongly coupled , _ superradiant _ state . in the present case this effect is due to the indirect coupling between up - down qds through the qw .",
    "the states strongly coupled to the qw yield a forbidden band with width @xmath75 and the states weakly coupled to the qw give an allowed dicke band with width @xmath93 .",
    "in this work we studied the transmission probability and transmission phase through a qw with an array of side - coupled double qds .",
    "we found that the transmission probability displays a gap or a band at the center of the energy spectrum , due to destructive and constructive interference in the ballistic channel , respectively .",
    "for an array with symmetry up - down ( @xmath71 ) only a gap develops at the center of the band . for @xmath94",
    "an allowed band arises at the center of the energy spectrum independently of the value of @xmath85 .",
    "this phenomenon is in analogy to the dicke effect in optics .",
    "the set of side coupled double qds seems a suitable system to study the dicke effect in experiments on quantum transport .",
    "this effect could be used to develop nanodevices where an extremely fine control of electron transport could be achieved just by varying the gate potential of the qds .",
