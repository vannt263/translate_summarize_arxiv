    "the exciton relative motion in qw is well studied and understood .",
    "the confinement of the carriers along one or two spatial directions into regions comparable to or smaller than the bulk exciton size enhances the effect of the electron - hole coulomb interaction .",
    "this results in larger binding energies and oscillator strengths and in an increased stability compared to bulk excitons .",
    "therefore , excitons are observed even at room temperature in these structures .",
    "the effect of the reduced dimensionality is as a rule much larger on the exciton groundstate than on the excited states .",
    "details of the excitonic optical spectra of qw related to the com  motion like , e.g. , inhomogeneous broadening and stokes shift between photoluminescence ( pl ) and absorption are frequently used for structure characterization .",

    "all these phenomena are intimately related to the exciton com  properties whereby different energy and com  momentum regions of the exciton dispersion are probed in different processes .    in many heterostructure systems of interest like , e.g. , gaas / alas , ingaas / inp and zncdse / znses , the exciton can be described in the effective - mass approximation ( wannier exciton ) due to its small bulk binding energy ( e.g. , 4  mev for gaas ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the degeneracy of the valence bands at the center of the brillouin zone for materials of cubic or zinc - blende symmetry was first taken into account by dresselhaus @xcite .",
    "he also pointed out the absence of a well - defined com  transformation due to this degeneracy .",
    "altarelli and lipari @xcite calculated the exciton com  dispersion for direct- and indirect - gap bulk semiconductors .",
    "they demonstrated that the ambiguity in the choice of the com  transformation can be used to achieve formal simplicity or optimal numerical convergence . for bulk gaas , where the heavy- to light - hole mass ratio is large , the exciton dispersions are found to be strongly anharmonic and",

    "the numerical effort for such calculations remains reasonable due to the high symmetry of this point .",
    "in contrast , only a few publications on multiband calculations of exciton com  dispersions in qw exist ( @xcite ) since these are very demanding .",

    "quasi as a by - product , a semi - analytical expression for the average exciton groundstate mass suitable for exciton localization problems is derived ( section [ smass ] ) .",

    "the different angular momentum components decouple @xcite , and changing the sign of @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ -p2 ] ) just changes the sign of two spin components leaving the other two unchanged ; this holds no longer at @xmath6 .",

    "the main drawback is the need for huge amounts of computer memory .",

    "on the other hand , we use a groundstate - adapted discretization of the coulomb potential @xcite which is discussed in more detail in the appendix . the idea behind this approach is to extract the discretized interaction from a reference system that has the same interaction but a simple kinetic term , and whose groundstate is known analytically .",

    "if one actually calculates the contributions of the higher exciton states to @xmath91 in ( [ pert2 ] ) ( which are dropped in ( [ meffold ] ) ) , one finds that the only important correction comes from the coupling to the @xmath92-like state . taking in eq .",

    "the @xmath3-dependence enters the wavefunction : ( i ) the need to appropriately combine the subband states to get the right @xmath3 and ( ii ) through the need for the envelope to adjust for the anharmonicities in the dispersions . in the perturbation approach described above",

    "we wish also to thank the rechenzentrum of the humboldt university and the konrad - zuse - zentrum in berlin for their support and access to their cray j932 ( project bvph08as ) .",
    "in order to attain a simple discretization for the interaction of some hamilton operator , glutsch , chemla , and bechstedt @xcite proposed to discretize on the same mesh another operator whose groundstate is analytically known with the same interaction but with a simple kinetic term ( mass @xmath194 ) . we will call this the reference system . for illustration , consider a simple one - dimensional system with known groundstate wavefunction @xmath195 of energy @xmath196 . the schrdinger equation of the reference system",
    "discretized on a mesh @xmath197 reads @xmath198 and yields the groundstate adapted discretization @xmath199 this procedure is very simple , easy to implement , cheap to calculate , and gives for the reference system always the correct groundstate energy , regardless how inappropriate the mesh is .",
    "in addition , no special handling for potentials with integrable singularities is needed .    using this discretization for a reference state similar enough to the one sought",
    ", one can expect good convergence with mesh size . in order to check how the dependence of the potential discretization on the reference state influences the results , we performed calculations of the ideal 2d and 3d excitons using discretizations of the coulomb potential based on reference excitonic groundstates with various bohr radii .",
    "[ fig_glutsch ] shows the lowest numerical eigenvalues as a function of gridpoint density .",
    "one can see that the correct estimation of the `` unknown '' groundstate is not so critical : a reference bohr radius @xmath118 within a factor of two from the actual one , @xmath200 , still gives good results for the groundstate for reasonable mesh densities .",
    "apparently , especially for the 2d case , it is better to choose @xmath118 rather larger than smaller in order to get good results also for the excited states .",
    "we also show for the 2d case the results obtained with the potential integrated analytically on each cartesian mesh element , using @xmath201 this gives also a very good convergence with the mesh size .",
    "the 2d result obtained for the groundstate with the potential integrated analytically only at the origin , and taking everywhere else its value at each gridpoint ( naive discretization ) is included in fig .",
    "[ fig_glutsch ] .",
    "since both discretizations are the same at the origin the difference does not originate from the divergence at this point .",
    "the superiority of the discretizations ( [ glutschvc ] ) and ( [ coul2dint ] ) is obvious .",
    "we therefore expect eq .",
    "( [ glutschvc ] ) to yield good results even with not very dense meshes .    for the 3d case a similar expression to eq .",
    "( [ coul2dint ] ) for the coulomb potential integrated analytically on a rectangular box can be derived .",
    "however , we could not use this result to attain an alternative discretization for the real - space qw calculations because the natural mesh @xmath202 is not cartesian in the relative coordinate @xmath203 .",
