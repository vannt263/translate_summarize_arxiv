    "accretion disks are now widely believed to be energy sources in various active phenomena in the universe : in protoplanetary nebulae around young stellar objects , in cataclysmic variables and supersoft x - ray sources , in galactic x - ray binaries and microquasars , and in active galaxies and quasars .",
    "accretion - disk models have been extensively studies during these three decades ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) .",
    "radiative transfer in the accretion disk has been investigated in relation to the structure of a static disk atmosphere and the spectral energy distribution from the disk surface ( e.g. , meyer , meyer - hofmeister 1982 ; cannizzo , wheeler 1984 ; ki and hubeny 1986 ; shaviv , wehrse 1986 ; adam et al .",

    "in many cases the diffusion approximation or eddington one was employed ; it provides a satisfactory description at large optical depth , although the emergent radiation field originates at optical depth of the order of unity .",
    "furthermore , gray and non - gray models of accretion disks were constructed under numerical treatments ( ki and hubeny 1986 ; shaviv and wehrse 1986 ; adam et al .",
    "1988 ; ross et al . 1992 ; shimura and takahara 1993 ; hubeny , hubeny 1997 , 1998 ; hubeny et al .",

    "; hui et al . 2005 ) and under analytical ones ( hubeny 1990 ; artemova et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in these studies , however , the vertical movement and the mass loss were not considered .",
    "hence , recently , in relation to the radiative disk wind , radiative transfer in a moving disk atmosphere was also investigated ( e.g. , fukue 2005a , b , 2006a , b ) .",
    "in contrast to the static atmosphere , in the moving atmosphere the boundary condition at the surface of zero optical depth should be modified ( fukue 2005a , b ) . moreover",
    ", the usual eddington approximation violates in the highly relativistic flow ( fukue 2005b ; see also turolla , nobili 1988 ; turolla et al .",
    "1995 ; dullemond 1999 ) , and the velocity - dependent variable eddington factor was proposed ( fukue 2006b ) .    in the usual studies of radiative transfer in the disk ,",
    "the emergent intensity has not been fully obtained , since the attention were usually focused on the disk internal structure such as a temperature distribution .",
    "in addition , the effect of limb darkening has not been well examined except for a few cases relating to cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , diaz et al .",
    "1996 ; wade , hubeny 1998 ; see also fukue 2000 ; hui et al .",
    "2005 for high energy cases ) .    in this paper",
    ", we thus reexamine radiative transfer in the accretion disk with _",
    "finite optical depth _ under the plane - parallel approximation , and analytically obtain an emergent intensity for the cases with or without internal heating . besides cataclysmic variables",
    ", we also emphasize and discuss the limb - darkening effect in an accretion disk for various cases .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic equations . in section 3 ,",
    "we show analytical solutions . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss several cases of accretion disk models , and emphasize the importance of the limb - darkening effect .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "we here assume the followings : ( i ) the disk is steady and axisymmetric .",
    "( ii ) it is also geometrically thin and plane parallel . (",
    "iii ) as a closure relation , we use the eddington approximation .",
    "( iv ) the gray approximation , where the opacity does not depend on frequency , is adopted .",
    "( v ) the viscous heating rate is concentrated at the equator or uniform in the vertical direction .",
    "the radiative transfer equations are given in several literatures ( chandrasekhar 1960 ; mihalas 1970 ; rybicki , lightman 1979 ; mihalas , mihalas 1984 ; shu 1991 ; kato et al .",

    "generally speaking , when the contribution of the radiative flux is small , compared with the pressure gradient term , the gas pressure dominates in the atmoshere , and the density distribution will not be constant . when the radiative flux is strong , on the other hand , the radiation pressure dominates , and the density may be approximately constant throughout much of the disk .",
    "anyway , we suppose that the density distribution would be ajusted so as to hold the hydrostatic equilibrium ( 4 ) through the main part of the disk atmosphere , under the radiative flux obtained later .    using this energy equation ( [ 328_energy.rad ] ) and introducing the optical depth , defined by @xmath17 we rewrite the radiative transfer equations : @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",

    "( ii ) uniform heating in the sense that @xmath23constant .",
    "the latter case means that the kinematic viscosity @xmath24 is constant in the vertical direction , since @xmath25 , as long as the opacities are constant .",

    "that is , in this case for low optical depth , the source function is very uniform .",
    "this , coupled with the absence of an isotropic source at the midplane , is why the geometric effect ( longer path length ) is dominant and one finds limb ` brightening ' .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly discuss the validity of the closure relation in the present treatment . in this paper",
    ", we have adopted the usual eddington approximation , where the ratio of the radiation pressure to the energy density is fixed as 1/3 , to close the moment equations . as is well known ,",
    "this approximation is correct in the limit of an isotropic radiation field .",
    "hence , in the problem of limb - darkening , where the deviation from the isotropy is essential , this approximation is only approximately correct , although it is used in the usual milne - eddington approximation .",
    "for example , let us suppose the case of a semi - infinite disk with an infinite optical depth @xmath36 , in this case , we easily calculate the energy density as well as the radiation pressure from the derived intensity ( 19 ) of the milne - eddington solution . at the deeper position in the atmosphere , where the integration is done in all directions , the re - calculated variables satisfy the condition of @xmath65 .",
    "however , at the surface of the disk , where the integration should be done in a semi - sphere , this is not true . at the surface of @xmath20",
    ", we integrate the emergent intensity to yield : @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "hence , in the case under the usual limb - darkening effect , the ratio of the radiation pressure to the energy density is slightly larger than 1/3 at the surface .",
    "this is just the peaking effect originated from the anisotropic radiation field near to the disk surface .    on the other hand , in the limb - brightening case of small optical depth with uniform heating ,",
    "the situation is reversed . in this case , the ratio of the radiation pressure to the energy density becomes smaller than 1/3 , and the eddington approximation holds approximately .",
    "this is also originated from the anisotropy , and may be called an _ anti - peaking _ effect . as is seen in figure 2 , the limb - brightening becomes stronger and stronger for small optical depth .",
    "hence , for such a case of very small optical depth , the eddington approximation would not be good , although the qualitative properties would not be changed .    in order to obtain the intensity distribution",
    "more precisely , we , for example , introduce a variable eddington factor , that is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "as was derived in the previous section , the emergent intensity @xmath3 of the accretion disk depends on the disk total optical depth @xmath36 as well as the direction cosine @xmath46 .",
    "the limb - darkening effect is considerably modified for small @xmath36 , compared with the usual case for infinite optical depth . even for the case with sufficiently large optical depth , limb darkening in the luminous accretion disk must be important , and",
    "should be examined more carefully .    in this section ,",
    "we discuss several cases in turn , and call the attention to the importance of the limb - darkening effect .      the optical depth at the midplane in the inner region of a geometrically thin standard disk ( shakura , sunyaev 1973 ;",
    "see also kato et al .",
    "1998 ) is expressed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the electron scattering optical depth , @xmath70 the viscous parameter , @xmath71 the mass accretion rate normalized by the critical rate @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 being the eddington luminosity of the central object , @xmath75 the radius normalized by the schwarzschild radius @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this optical depth becomes small for large @xmath71 and/or small @xmath75 . for a slightly large accretion rate , inside some critical radius @xmath78 the disk shifts to a supercritical regime , whereas the disk is a standard regime outside @xmath79 ( fukue 2004 ) . at this critical radius ,",
    "the optical depth becomes @xmath80 hence , in a usual situation the optical depth of the inner region of the standard disk is greater than several tens .",
    "in such a situation , however , due to a usual limb - darkening effect for semi - infinite medium , the emergent radiation toward the pole - on direction is enchanced by 20 percent , while the emergent radiation seen from the edge - on direction diminishes by 50 percent .",
    "thus , in calculating the flux and spectrum of the standard disk , we carefully consider the limb - darkening effect .    in the region inside the inner edge at @xmath81",
    ", the disk gas freely falls toward the central black hole , and the surface density ( i.e. , the disk optical depth ) quickly drops .",
    "hence , the emergent spectrum from the innermost region inside the inner edge would be greatly modified from the optically thick case and the optically thin one .      in the supercritical accretion disk ,",
    "where the mass accretion rate exceeds the critical rate , the expression for the disk optical depth is changed .",
    "for example , in the self - similar model without mass loss ( fukue 2000 ) , the optical depth at the midplane of the disk is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a coefficient of the order of unity . at the critical radius ,",
    "the disk optical depth is @xmath84    in the critical accretion disk ( fukue 2004 ) , where the mass accretion rate exceeds the critical one , but the excess mass is expelled by the wind mass loss , the optical depth at the midplane of the disk is @xmath85 at the critical radius , the disk optical depth is @xmath86    hence , in a usual situation the optical depth of the supercritical / critical disk is also greater than several tens .    in such a situation ,",
    "however , the usual limb - darkening effect for semi - infinite medium is also important ( see fukue 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to the limb - darkening effect , the geometrical effects , such as a _ projection effect _ and a _ self - occultation _ , should be considered in calculating the flux and spectrum of the supercritical disk ( e.g. , fukue 2000 ; watarai et al .",
    "2005 ; kawata et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "if a luminous disk is sandwiched by a disk corona , the situation is similar to the case without heating , but with the incident intensity from the midplane .",
    "hence , when the optical depth of the corona is sufficiently smaller than unity , the emergent intensity is just that of the disk , except for a very small direction cosine . however , when the optical depth of the corona is a few , limb darkening takes place , and the emergent intensity toward the edge - on direction remarkably reduces .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the accretion rate is quite small , and the inner region of the disk becomes an optically - thin advection dominated state ( adaf ) , the situation is similar to the case with internal heating , although , rigorously speaking , the plane - parallel approximation may be invalid .",
    "when the optical depth of an adaf region is sufficiently smaller than unity , the limb brightening would take place .",
    "in both cases with hot gas , however , the effect of the compton scattering may be important .",
    "hence , the angle dependence of the intensity would be modified by the angle dependence of the compton scattering , and the transfer problem should be treated more carefully .",
    "in addition , in the latter case of adaf , the accretion flow is supposed to be conical or spherical .",
    "hence , when the opening angle is small , the limb brightening would qualitatively take place .",
    "when the opening angle is large , on the other hand , the extension of the emitting region is large , and the angle dependence of the emergent intensity would become much more complicated than the present simple case .      in the case of the relativistic standard disk ( e.g. , novikov , thorne 1973 ; page , thorne 1974 ) , the situation is similar to the non - relativistic case .",
    "however , the direction cosine of the local emergent intensity in the disk to the observer is changed by two additional reasons : ( i ) the light trajectory is bent by the space - time curvature , and ( ii ) the emission from the gas rotating around a black hole suffers from the special relativistic aberration .",
    "limb - darkening effect in the comoving frame on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the relativistic accretion disk was considered by , e.g. , fu and taam ( 1990 ) and gierliski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "recently , due to submilliarcsecond astrometry , imaging of a black - hole _",
    "silhouette _ is expected to become possible in the near future at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "the `` photographs '' of relativistic accretion disks around a black hole have been obtained by many researchers ( luminet 1979 ; fukue , yokoyama 1988 ; karas et al .",
    "1992 ; jaroszyski et al . 1992 ; fanton et al . 1997",
    "; fukue 2003 ; takahashi 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "in these studies , however , the usual limb darkening was not considered .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure03.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure04.eps    examples of silhouettes of a dressed black hole are shown in figures 3 and 4 . in figure 3",
    "an edge - on view with inclination angle of 80@xmath87 is shown , while a pole - on view is expressed in figure 4 . in both figures ,",
    "the left panels are for the case without limb darkening , whereas the right panels are for the case with limb darkening .    in the edge - on view ( figure 3 ) , the image of a limb - darkening disk darkens as expected .",
    "this is due mainly to the usual limb - darkening effect for small direction cosine .",
    "surprisingly , on the other hand , in the pole - on view ( figure 4 ) , the image of a limb - darkeing disk also darkens ! this is because that the local direction cosine becomes small due to the light aberration associated with the disk rotation .",
    "thus , in calculating spectra and observed fluxed of relativistic disks as well as in taking black hole silhouettes , we should carefully consider limb darkening .",
