    "at the end of the last century , the astronomical observations of high redshift type ia supernovae ( snia ) indicated that our universe is not only expanding , but also accelerating , which conflicts with our deepest intuition of gravity . with some other observations , such as cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and large - scale structure ( lss ) , physicists proposed a new standard cosmology model , @xmath0cdm , which introduces the cosmological constant back again .",
    "although this unknown energy component accounts for 73% of the energy density of the universe , the measured value is too small to be explained by any current fundamental theories.@xcite-@xcite if one tries to solve this trouble phenomenologically by setting the cosmological constant to a particular value , the so - called fine - tuning problem would be brought up , which is considered as a basic problem almost any cosmological model would encounter .",
    "a good model should restrict the fine - tuning as much as possible . in order to alleviate this problem ,",
    "various alternative theories have been proposed and developed these years , such as dynamical dark energy , modified gravity theories and even inhomogeneous universes .",
    "recently , a new attempt , called torsion cosmology , has attracted researchers attention , which introduces dynamical torsion to mimic the contribution of the cosmological constant .",
    "it seems more natural to use a pure geometric quantity to account for the cosmic acceleration than to introduce an exotic energy component .",
    "torsion cosmology could be traced back to the 1970s , and the early work mainly focused on issues of early universe , such as avoiding singularity and the origin of inflation . in some recent work , researchers attempted to extend the investigation to the current evolution and found it might account for the cosmic acceleration . among these models , poincar gauge theory ( pgt ) cosmology is the one that has been investigated most widely .",
    "this model is based on pgt , which is inspired by the einstein special relativity and the localization of global poincar symmetry@xcite .",
    "et al_. made a comprehensive survey of torsion cosmology and developed the equations for all the pgt cases.@xcite based on goenner s work , nester and his collaborators@xcite found that the dynamical scalar torsion could be a possible reason for the accelerating expansion .",
    "et al_.@xcite extended the investigation to the late time evolution , which shows us the fate of our universe .",
    "besides pgt cosmology , there is another torsion cosmology , de sitter gauge theory ( dsgt ) cosmology , which can also be a possible explanation to the accelerating expansion .",
    "this cosmological model is based on the de sitter gauge theory , in which gravity is introduced as a gauge field from de sitter invariant special relativity ( dssr ) , via the localization of de sitter symmetry.@xcite dssr is a special relativity theory of the de sitter space rather than the conventional minkowski spacetime , which is another maximally symmetric spacetime with an uniform scalar curvature @xmath1 . and the full symmetry group of this space is de sitter group , which unifies the lorentz group and the translation group , putting the spacetime symmetry in an alternatively interesting way .",
    "but in the limit of @xmath2 , the de sitter group could also degenerate to the poincar group .",
    "to localize such a global symmetry , de sitter symmetry , requires us to introduce certain gauge potentials which are found to represent the gravitational interaction .",
    "the gauge potential for de sitter gauge theory is the de sitter connecion , which combines lorentz connection and orthonormal tetrad , valued in @xmath3(1,4 ) algebra .",
    "the gravitational action of dsgt takes the form of yang - mills gauge theory . via variation of the action with repect to the the lorentz connection and orthonormal tetrad",
    ", one could attain the einstein - like equations and gauge - like equations , respectively .",
    "these equations comprise a set of complicated non - linear equations , which are difficult to tackle .",
    "nevertheless , if we apply them to the homogeneous and isotropic universe , these equations would be much more simpler and tractable . based on these equations",
    ", one could construct an alternative cosmological model with torsion .",
    "analogous to pgt , dsgt has also been applied to the cosmology recently to explain the accelerating expansion.@xcite    our main motivation of this paper is to investigate ( i)whether the cosmological model based on de sitter gauge theory could explain the cosmic acceleration ; ( ii)where we are going , i.e. , what is the fate of our universe ; ( iii ) the constraints of the parameters of model imposed by means of the comparison of observational data . by some analytical and numerical calculations",
    ", we found that , with a wide range of initial values , this model could account for the current status of the universe , an accelerating expanding , and the universe would enter an exponential expansion phase in the end .    this paper is organized as follows : first , we summarize the de sitter gauge theory briefly in sec .

    "next in the [ sec : supern - data - fitt]th section , we compare the cosmological solutions to the snia data and constrain the parameters .",
