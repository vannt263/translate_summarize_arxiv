    "several exciting new applications of optics rely on spatial phase and amplitude control of light . in adaptive optics",
    ", light is modulated to correct for abberations in a variety of optical systems such as the human eye @xcite or the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "digital holography is another area of optics which relies on the spatial modulation of light .",
    "holographic data storage @xcite , 3d display technology @xcite , and diffractive optical elements @xcite are just a few examples of the many exciting topics in digital holography that require a very precise modulation of light . very recently , it was shown that light can be focussed through and inside opaque strongly scattering materials by sending in spatially shaped wavefronts @xcite .",
    "liquid crystal spatial light modulators ( lc slms ) are used in many cases where modulation of light is required because of their high optical efficiency , high number of degrees of freedom , and wide availability .",
    "a lc slm can modulate the phase and the amplitude of light at typical refresh rates of @xmath060  hz and at resolutions in the order of @xmath1 pixels . aside from their advantages , commercially available slms have some limitations . in most lc slms",
    "the modulation of phase is coupled to a modulation of the polarization .",
    "this makes it hard to independently modulate the phase or the amplitude .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to achieve independent spatial phase and amplitude control using a slm .",
    "examples are setups where two slms are used to balance out the cross modulation @xcite , double pass configurations where the light propagates twice through the same slm @xcite , and double pixel setups which divide the encoding of complex values over two neighboring pixels @xcite .",
    "each of these techniques has its specific limitations .",
    "the use of two slms in one setup @xcite requires a sensitive alignment and valuable space .",
    "double pass configurations @xcite double the phase modulation capacities of the slm , usually delivering a full @xmath2 phase shift . unfortunately though , to keep the amplitude constant , the slm has to work in a mostly - phase condition which requires light of a specific elliptical polarization .",
    "double pixel setups @xcite also require special modulation properties like amplitude - only modulation @xcite , phase - only modulation @xcite , or a phase modulation range of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these properties are usually achieved by sending in light under certain specific polarizations .",
    "small deviations from these polarizations already modify the modulation properties , leading to drift in the achieved amplitudes and phases .",
    "we propose a novel modulation technique to achieve amplitude and phase modulation of light using a slm together with a spatial filter .",
    "this technique does not pose special requirements on the slm or the incoming light , making our technique more widely applicable than previous techniques . in our experiments we used a holoeye lc - r 2500 twisted nematic liquid crystal display ( tn - lcd ) which has @xmath3x@xmath4 pixels ( @xmath5 m square in size ) and which can modulate with 8-bit accuracy ( 256 voltage levels ) .",
    "this slm has a strong cross - modulation between the phase and the polarization of the light .",
    "we demonstrate the use of this slm to independently modulate phase and amplitude .",
    "twisted nematic liquid crystal displays ( tn - lcds ) owe their name to the helical structure formed by the molecules inside the lcd cells , in absence of an electric field .",
    "when a voltage is applied over the edges of the lcd cell , the molecules are aligned to the electric field and the twisted structure disappears . by changing the voltage over the cells ,",
    "the internal structure is changed continuously from a twisted to a straight alignment of the molecules , affecting both the phase and the polarization of the reflected light .    to determine the relation between the applied voltage and the modulation of the light , the modulation curve of our slm",
    ", we used a diffractive technique where we placed a binary grating with a 50% duty cycle on the display , comparable with the technique described in @xcite . using a polarizing beam splitter we illuminated the slm with vertically polarized light and detected the horizontally polarized component of the modulated light .",
    "we measured the intensity in the 0@xmath6 order of the far - field diffraction pattern for different contrast levels of the grating .",
    "the contrast difference is achieved by keeping the notches of the grating steady at a constant value while we cycled the voltage values of the rules of the grating over the complete voltage range in 256 steps .",
    "we determined the real and imaginary parts of the field as a function of the voltage level encoded on the pixels , by comparing the measured @xmath7 order intensity for different pixel values on both the notches and the rules of the grating .",
    "the results of these measurements are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlepixelresponse ] .",
    "when no voltage is applied there is a @xmath8 phaseshift and the amplitude is close to zero . with increasing voltage , the phase is modulated from @xmath8 back to @xmath9 where the amplitude is at a maximum .",
    "if the voltage is increased further to the maximal voltage , the phase is modulated up to @xmath10 while the amplitude decreases slightly .",
    "the deviation of the modulation curve from a circle centered around the origin , is a clear indication of cross - modulation .",
    "the diaphragm is positioned such that it only transmits light under a certain angle .",
    "this angle is chosen so that , in the horizontal dimension , two neighboring pixels are exactly @xmath11 out of phase with each other , as can be seen from the inset . behind the diaphragm",
    ", the light is collimated by a lens , l2.,width=8 ]     with respect to each other . in this figure",
    "we show a limited modulation range of the pixels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the numbers outside the plot relate the curves to the pixel numbers . by choosing the right pixel values for the different pixels",
    ", every complex value can be synthesized by the superpixel . in the figure",
    "pixel 1 and 3 are used to modulate a value on the real axis .",
    "the electric fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 are chosen such that their imaginary parts cancel and @xmath14 lies on the real axis .",
    "pixels 1 and 3 are used in a similar way to modulate any value on the imaginary axis.,width=7 ]    by combining four neighboring pixels into one superpixel , we decouple the modulation of the phase and the amplitude , thereby achieving full independent phase and amplitude control of light . any arbitrary complex amplitude can be synthesized even though each individual pixel on the slm has a limited complex response ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : singlepixelresponse ] ) .",
    "this technique is based on the work done by birch et al .",
    "@xcite where they combined two neighboring pixels of a amplitude - only slm , to achieve full independent phase and amplitude modulation . by using four pixels instead of two ,",
    "our technique no longer depends on a special modulation curve .",
    "there are only two requirements on the modulation curve .",
    "first of all , the real part of the modulation curve should be an increasing function of the applied voltage .",
    "secondly , for each imaginary value on the modulation curve where the derivative is non - zero , there should exist at least two different solutions .",
    "for every known slm the modulation curve , or a suitable subset , follows these two requirements .",
    "the setup used to decouple the phase and amplitude modulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . a monochromatic beam of light at a wavelength of @xmath15  nm is incident normal to the slm surface .",
    "the modulated light is reflected from the slm .",
    "we choose an observation plane at an angle at which the contribution of each neighboring pixel is @xmath11 out of phase , as is seen in the inset .",
    "the fields from the individual pixels are superposed using a spatial filter . by choosing the correct combination of pixel voltages , any complex value within a square ( -1 ..",
    "1),(-i .. i ) can be synthesized .    to construct a complex value @xmath16",
    ", we use the first and third pixel of a superpixel to construct @xmath17 and the second and the fourth pixel to construct @xmath18 . the voltage for the first and third pixel , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "are chosen such that the imaginary parts of the modulated fields are equal and the difference between the real parts of the modulated fields is equal to @xmath17 ( a detailed discussion about how to find the voltages can be found in appendix  [ app : howtofindvoltages ] ) .",
    "the fields modulated by the two pixels are then @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the real parts of the fields modulated by pixel @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the imaginary term of the modulated fields . in the plane of reconstruction , the two pixels are @xmath27 out of phase .",
    "therefore the imaginary parts of the modulated fields cancel each other while the real parts are subtracted and produce a non - zero real value equal to @xmath17 . a geometrical representation of this construction is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : responsefourpixels ] .",
    "we construct @xmath18 in a similar way using the second and the fourth pixel .",
    "the fields modulated by the these two pixels are then chosen to be @xmath28 the @xmath11 phase shift between all the neighboring pixels in a superpixel causes that the reconstructed values @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath11 out of phase . the total reconstructed field is therefore @xmath29 which is exactly the complex value @xmath30 we wanted to modulate .",

    "the experiment was done for multiple amplitude differences between the rules and the notches of the grating .",
    "the solid lines represent the expected intensities.,width=8 ]    we tested the modulation technique with the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "we placed an extra lens and a ccd camera behind the spatial filter to detect the modulated light in the far - field .",
    "first we demonstrate the decoupling of the phase and amplitude modulation .",
    "we encoded the same amplitudes and phases on all superpixels of the slm , forming a plane light wave .",
    "the plane wave was then focused onto the ccd camera .",
    "we measured the intensity in the focus while changing the phase and amplitude of the plane wave . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarplotphaseamplitude ] the relative amplitudes from the intensity measurements are plotted against the phase of the plane wave . for different amplitude modulations ,",
    "the phase is cycled from 0 to @xmath2 .",
    "it is seen from the results , that we modulate the phase while keeping the amplitude of the light constant within @xmath60 .",
    "next we show that the set phase modulation is in agreement with the measured phase modulation .",
    "we placed a binary grating with a 50% duty cycle on the slm .",
    "we modified the contrast by keeping one part of the grating constant at a relative amplitude , @xmath61 , of 0.5 while changing the relative amplitude of the other part , @xmath62 between 0 and 1 . for each value of @xmath62",
    "we changed the phase difference between the two parts of the grating , @xmath63 , from 0 to 2@xmath27 . because of interference , the recorded intensity , i , at the ccd camera changes as a function of a , b , and @xmath63 in the following way : @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_intensityvsphase ] the results are presented for three different values of b. both the amplitude and the phase of the measured oscillations match the theory well , demonstrating an independent phase modulation in agreement with the set phase difference . with",
    "the new modulation technique we are able to modulate the phase of the light from @xmath9 to @xmath2 , even though each individual pixel is not able to modulate a full @xmath2 phase shift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : singlepixelresponse ] ) .",
    "finally we demonstrate complex spatial modulation of light .",
    "we encoded the fourier transform of an image onto the slm .",
    "the original image is reconstructed in the far - field and was recorded by the ccd camera . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fftphaseandamplitude ] the reconstructed intensity is shown on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the letters in the image stand out with high contrast . around the letters ,",
    "small areas containing noise are seen .",
    "the relative intensity of the noise is smaller than 10@xmath65 .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to achieve full independent spatial phase and amplitude control using a twisted nematic liquid crystal display together with a spatial filter .",
    "our novel modulation scheme combines four neighboring pixels into one superpixel .",
    "each superpixel is able to independently generate any complex amplitude value .",
    "we demonstrated that we were able to freely modulate the phase over a range of 2@xmath27 while keeping the amplitude of the light constant within 2.5@xmath65 .",
    "furthermore we showed that we could achieve a spatially complex modulation of the light with a high resolution .",
    "the presented modulation technique can be used with any slm .",
    "no special modulation response is needed , therefore the illumination light can have linear polarization .",
    "this polarization makes a relative simple calibration possible . using linearly polarized light",
