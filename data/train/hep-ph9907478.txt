    "the superkamiokande detector  @xcite has observed a large deficit in the number of muon - neutrinos generated in the atmosphere by cosmic rays .",
    "this deficit increases as the propagation distance of the neutrinos increases .",
    "qualitatively similar results were observed by previous experiments , e.g.  the kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite and soudan detectors @xcite .",
    "the straightforward explanation of the data is that the neutrino flavor states are non - degenerate , and so the neutrino flavor changes as the neutrinos propagate .",
    "this non - degeneracy is readily explained in the standard model by small neutrino masses ( standard mechanism ) .",
    "however other explanations of the atmospheric neutrino observations have been proposed that do not require neutrino masses .",
    "one possibility is that the degeneracy of the neutrinos is broken by a violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) ( this was proposed by gasperini  @xcite and independently by halprin and leung  @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the neutrino degeneracy is broken by a violation of lorentz invariance ( liv ) ( this was proposed by coleman and glashow @xcite ) .",
    "these two possibilities , vep and liv , produce identical neutrino mixing effects @xcite , which differ from those of the standard mechanism . in this paper we find the constraints imposed on these and other nonstandard neutrino oscillation mechanisms by accelerator , atmospheric , reactor and solar neutrino observations .",
    "the important difference between the standard mass mixing mechanism and the vep / liv scenario is the way the neutrino oscillation probability depends on energy . for either oscillation mechanism ,",
    "the conversion probability between two neutrino flavors @xmath0 and @xmath1 is written as p(__)= ^2 2 [ 1 - ( 2 l ) ] , [ p2 ] where @xmath2 is the propagation length and @xmath3 is the mixing angle between the two flavors .",
    "this expression neglects the mixing with the third neutrino and also background matter effects . for the mass mechanism , _ mass = 4 e m^2 = 2,500 km ( 10 ^ -3 ev^2 m^2 ) ( e 1 gev ) [ mlam ] where @xmath4 is the difference in neutrino masses squared and @xmath5 is the neutrino energy . in the case of the vep scenario ,",

    "herein we use the vep notation in our presentation of neutrino data analyses .",
    "the standard mixing mechanism has strong theoretical motivation .",
    "the vep / liv mixing mechanism is less well motivated , but it inspires the phenomenological question @xcite , ` how well determined is the energy dependence of the neutrino vacuum oscillation wavelength ' ?",
    "here we consider , besides the vep / liv mixing mechanism , a generalized neutrino mixing mechanism with a vacuum oscillation wavelength _",

    "the standard mixing mechanism is @xmath12 and any other value , such as the the vep / liv mixing mechanism with @xmath13 , is exotic .",
    "here we also analyze neutrino data in this generalized mixing scheme .",
    "the different energy dependences of the mixing mechanisms influence how neutrino data are analyzed and interpreted .",
    "for example , atmospheric neutrino observations imply large mixing between the muon - neutrino ( @xmath14 ) and the tau - neutrino ( @xmath15 ) , but are relatively insensitive to electron - neutrino ( @xmath16 ) mixing @xcite .",
    "chooz @xcite reactor observations constrain the @xmath16 mixing of atmospheric neutrinos in the standard mechanism , but not in the vep / liv mechanism . thus simplifying assumptions , such as that only two - neutrino oscillations are relevant for atmospheric neutrinos , are valid only for particular energy dependences of the mixing mechanism .",
    "a similar situation occurs for solar neutrinos .",
    "solar neutrino observations imply mixing of @xmath16 . in the standard mechanism",
    "the atmospheric and solar observations imply two different oscillation scales , but in the vep / liv mechanism the same scale may suffice for both @xcite . thus it is clearly necessary to include the mixing of all three neutrinos when attempting to describe the various neutrino observations in an exotic mixing mechanism .    in section",
    "ii , we describe our three flavor oscillation formalism .",
    "herein we adopt the simplifying approximation that only one neutrino mixing scale is relevant . in section iii , we find the constraints on oscillation parameters from accelerator experiments .",

    "the mixing of three neutrinos can depend on several parameters .",
    "if the neutrino mixing is caused by any one of the standard , vep or liv mechanisms , then the observable parameters are two mixing scales , three mixing angles and a phase . if more than one of these mechanisms occur , then the number of observable parameters is more than doubled @xcite . here",

    "we make the simplifying approximation that only one mixing scale is relevant .",

    "in the two - flavor _ vacuum _ approximation , neutrino oscillation effects are symmetric for mixing angles in the ranges 0 to @xmath38 and @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",

    "the limits on the vep / liv mixing scale from the @xmath14-@xmath16 oscillation parameters are much more severe than those from @xmath57 oscillations , because the former can produce a 50-fold enhancement in the @xmath16 flux while the latter reduces the flux by at most 50% .",

    "the precise @xmath11 value of the accelerator limit is relatively insensitive to whether the mixing is two - flavor or three - flavor .",
    "reactor experiments are only sensitive to @xmath16 mixing , so they only exclude the best fit three - neutrino constraint for @xmath126 . this agree with the general observation for the standard mixing mechanism , @xmath12 , that the chooz reactor neutrino measurements limit the size of the @xmath16 mixing in the region allowed by the atmospheric neutrino data .",

    "the atmospheric data clearly indicate mixing , and this must be accounted for .",

    "the choice of exactly what parameters to add is not completely obvious .",
    "the standard mechanism is supported by theoretical prejudice , but fig .",
    "( 3 ) shows that the data still allow a wide choice of exotic solutions .",
    "a two mixing scale analysis , involving the standard mixing mechanism and an exotic mixing mechanism , must necessarily involve at least 7 parameters and is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    ", we have used that they are characterized by energies of order 10 mev , and for a solar length scale we have used the shortest possible length scale for which large , energy dependent flux reductions are possible  the scale of density variations in the sun , which is about 10% of the sun s radius .    for @xmath133 ( which includes the standard mechanism at @xmath12 ) the indications of mixing imply @xmath134 and",
    "so the solar and atmospheric neutrinos are described by different scales .",
    "this conclusion is only enhanced if the larger length scales possible in the sun are used , such at the earth - sun distance .",

    "apart from the usual standard mixing mechanism , the vep / liv mixing mechanism can explain the observed total rate of neutrino events in the different solar neutrino detectors . in  @xcite , the analysis using the first 504 days total rate measured by the superkamiokande gives two allowed solutions : the small angle solution at ( @xmath137 ) , and the large angle solution at ( @xmath138 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have updated our results using the first 708 days data  @xcite run of the sk experiment for the total rate .",
    "the rate analysis is necessarily unchanged from the one in  @xcite as no considerable change in the measurement of the sk total rate has occured .",
    "the main change is in the spectral shape analysis as the highest data bin is now considerably lower than the 504 days result .",
    "this will change the spectral shape analysis exclusion region of ref .",
