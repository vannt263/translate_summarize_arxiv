    "the connections between second order differential equations of linear and nonlinear type and riccati and abel first order nonlinear equations , respectively , are well known and referred in many textbooks @xcite .",
    "abel equations of the first kind look similar to the riccati equations but with an additional cubic nonlinearity , @xmath0 while those of the second kind have the more general format , @xmath1\\frac{d \\eta}{du}%+g(u)\\eta+h(u ) = f_0(u)+f_1(u)\\eta+f_2(u)\\eta^2+f_3(u)\\eta^3~,\\ ] ] and also chronologically occurred first in abel s famous study on elliptic functions @xcite in the form : @xmath2\\frac{d \\eta}{du}%+g(u)\\eta+h(u ) = f_0(u)+f_1(u)\\eta+f_2(u)\\eta^2~.\\ ] ] however , we stress that the two types of abel equations are equivalent since they can be obtained one from the other through the change of the dependent variable @xmath3 . in the following , we first state a simple ` connection ' result for the particular case of ( [ n2p1 ] ) as given in ( [ n2p ] ) .",
    "we then turn the latter in its first - kind form , equation ( [ n19 ] ) below , and present chiellini s integrability result @xcite which is also mentioned in the book of kamke @xcite .",
    "our discussion of chiellini s result goes beyond that in chiellini s paper and in kamke s book .",
    "next , we show that one does not need to find @xmath4 from ( [ n2p ] ) , but directly from a factorization technique as applied to the corresponding second order ode .",
    "finally , we will use our findings to introduce new types of integrable second - order nonlinear ode providing also their solutions and we end up the letter with several conclusions . for the reader interested in other approaches to the integrability of abel s equation and general overview we recommend @xcite .",
    "we now briefly present the results we need .",
    "a first fundamental result is the following lemma .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * lemma 1 * : solutions to a nonlinear second order ode of the type @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are general functions of @xmath8 , may be obtained via the solutions to the second - kind abel s equation @xmath9 and vice versa using the following relationship @xmath10 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this equivalence can be found in the book of polyanin and zaitsev in the simpler case @xmath11 , which they call nonlinear oscillator equations @xcite .    * proof * : to show the equivalence , one just need the simple chain rule @xmath12 which turns ( [ n1p ] ) into @xmath13    which is ( [ n2p ] ) .",
    "thus , the solutions of the several classes of known solvable abel equations @xcite are just the derivatives of the solutions of the second order nonlinear equations of the type ( [ n1p ] ) .",
    "hence , if one could solve ( [ n2p ] ) for @xmath4 , then @xmath14 could be found via inverting @xmath15    as we already said we will also need the following result .",

    "we wish to point out that an abel equation of the type ( [ n2p ] ) with an additional quadratic ( riccati ) nonlinearity is still allowed in the connection result because it leads to a linear term @xmath22 in the abel equation and such a term can be always eliminated via the transformation @xmath23 . hence without loss of generality , we will work only with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath24 and take into account chiellini s condition , then one gets @xmath25 and , therefore , the first - kind abel equation ( [ n2p ] ) becomes @xmath26 which is separable as follows @xmath27 the right - hand - side of ( [ n21 ] ) can be written as @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , one obtains @xmath29 the implicit solutions depend on the constant @xmath19 , and are given by @xmath30}=d_1\\frac h g & \\textrm{if $ k=\\frac 1 4 $ } \\\\",

    ", this important result drew the attention of very few people . in the 1960s , bandi wrote a couple of related mathematical papers @xcite , while much later borghero and melis @xcite used it in the so - called szebehely s problem of finding the generalized potential function which is compatible with prescribed dynamical trajectories of a holonomic system .",
    "more recently , mak and harko @xcite devised a method to get general solutions of the first - kind abel equation from a particular solution based on chiellini s result and the list closes with a paper by yurov and yurov in cosmology @xcite .",
    "we also mention a very recent unpublished work by harko et al @xcite for the case of particular linard equations .",
    "in this section , we will explain how we use the factorization method applied to ( [ n1p ] ) to obtain the solutions of ( [ n2p ] ) .",
    "the factored form of ( [ n1p ] ) reads @xmath38 \\left[\\frac{d}{d \\zeta}-\\phi_{1}(u)\\right ] u(\\zeta)=0~.\\ ] ] expanding ( [ n2 ] ) and identifying terms , rosu and cornejo - prez @xcite obtained the equation @xmath39 which leads to the following conditions on the two factoring functions @xmath40    the solutions @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the system ( [ n5 ] ) are easily obtained by solving the quadratic equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . by choosing @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 it is not a coincidence to notice that if @xmath49 then the equation for factors ( [ n7 ] ) , is indeed abel s equation ( [ n2p ] ) .",
    "therefore , rather than solving ( [ n2p ] ) , @xmath4 can be obtained from the factors of the ode .",
    "interestingly , the factorization method provides another argument for the two equivalences , ( [ n10 ] ) and ( [ n6p ] ) . from the factorization ( [ n2 ] ) we have @xmath50u(\\zeta)=0 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , if we take @xmath52 , then also @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , the interpretation of the abel solution as in ( [ n6p ] ) permits the formulation of another lemma as follows .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * lemma 2 * : for chiellini - integrable odes , i.e. , odes that have @xmath16 , and @xmath17 connected via chiellini s condition , the solution to abel s equation ( [ n2p ] ) is given by @xmath54 where the constant @xmath55 is given in terms of chiellini s constant through @xmath56    * proof * : let @xmath57 , and substitute in ( [ n2p ] ) , then one gets @xmath58 with the roots given by ( [ sol-1 ] ) . _",
