    "we analyse the contribution of the @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath153 form factors in our cross sections under the same circumstances .",
    "first , let us observe that the calculations performed by setting @xmath155 ( long - dot - dashed lines ) almost reproduce the full cross sections ( solid lines ) .",
    "this shows , in agreement with the outcomes of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the contribution of the dirac form factor is very small",
    ". the cross section can then be very well approximated as a sum of three terms : one proportional to ( @xmath153)@xmath156 , a second proportional to ( @xmath104)@xmath156 , and a third proportional to the interference of @xmath153 and @xmath104 contributions .",
    "the term proportional to ( @xmath153)@xmath156 ( dashed lines ) is very similar to the corresponding one in fig .",

    "the same holds for the cross sections obtained by nullifying @xmath153 ( short - dot - dashed lines ) , whose behaviour is almost entirely given by @xmath157 term .",
    "thus , the fact that our curves neglecting the @xmath103 contribution differ from those in ref .",
    "@xcite can mainly be attributed to the @xmath158 interference term .",

    "@xcite display some oscillations as a function of @xmath159 . as can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig.:c12crossncplane150 ] and [ fig.:c12formfactors ] , we find no indications for these oscillations .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have extended their work to calculate cc neutrino cross sections @xcite .",
    "we remark that for this type of neutrino reactions the magnitude of the cross sections is in agreement with the rpwia limit of the models presented here .",
    "it is well known that binding - energy effects tend to vanish with increasing energies .",
    "accordingly , a description of the @xmath3-nucleus scattering process in terms of a rfg model is expected to approach the rpwia predictions at high incoming neutrino energies .",
    "this is observed in fig .",

    "@xcite and our rpwia results lends us additional confidence that the rpwia results presented here can serve as benchmark calculations .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the effect of fsi .",
    "nc @xmath3-nucleus cross sections obtained within rdwia and rmsga are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.:c12nc ] .",
    "the calculations correspond to @xmath0c and @xmath1fe targets , and incoming energies of @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath161 mev .",
    "focusing on the results of the rdwia model , the inclusion of the complex optical potential reduces the rpwia results by nearly @xmath162 for @xmath0c .",
    "as expected , the global effect of fsi increases with growing atomic number , and reductions of over @xmath163 are obtained for @xmath1fe .",
    "the presence of the imaginary term in the optical potential is likely to lead to an underestimation of the single - nucleon knockout contribution to the inclusive cross section .",
    "indeed , in inclusive measurements all possible final channels are included , whilst the rdwia and rmsga calculations are confined to `` elastic '' single - nucleon knockout .",
    "traditionally , glauber - inspired models have been esteemed to provide reliable results at high energies , as they rely on the eikonal approximation . a very striking outcome of fig .  [ fig.:c12nc ]",
    "is that , for integrated quantities as the ones involved in neutrino experiments , the rmsga cross sections compare very well with the rdwia ones down to remarkably low ejectile kinetic energies of about @xmath164 mev . below this energy ,",
    "the rmsga predictions are not realistic due to the underlying approximations , mainly the postulation of linear trajectories and frozen spectator nucleons .    for the sake of completeness , in fig .",
    "[ fig.:fe56cc ] we show our predictions for cc @xmath3-nucleus cross sections .",
    "the effects of fsi are of the same order as for nc , and very similar results are also obtained within rmsga and rdwia down to very low ejectile kinetic energies .",
    "a quantity routinely used to estimate the overall effect of fsi in nucleon - emission processes is the nuclear transparency .",
    "intuitively , it provides a measure for the probability that a nucleon of a certain energy - above the particle - emission threshold - can escape from the nucleus without being subject to any further interaction . from this definition",
    ", one can expect that the nuclear transparency is identical for neutrino and electron induced nucleon knockout .",
    "once the nucleon is traversing the nuclear medium , only its energy is expected to determine the way it propagates .",
    "in addition , neutrinos and electrons can be expected to probe equal amounts of bulk and surface parts of the target nucleus .",
    "several investigations of the nuclear transparency have been carried out using the @xmath7 reaction in the qe regime ( i.e. the bjorken variable @xmath165 ) , and data for different nuclei are now available . the nuclear transparency is extracted from the ratio of the measured @xmath7 yield to the calculated one using the plane - wave impulse approximation , according to @xmath166 the quantity @xmath167 specifies the experimental phase - space in missing momentum ( @xmath168 ) and energy ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the kinematics cuts @xmath170 mev / c and @xmath171 mev , in combination with the requirement that @xmath172 , guarantee that the electro - induced proton - emission process is predominantly quasi - elastic .",
    "the factor @xmath173 is introduced to correct in a phenomenological way for short - range mechanisms , and is assumed to be moderately target - mass dependent ( @xmath174 for @xmath0c , and @xmath175 for @xmath1fe ) .",
    "it accounts for the fact that short - range correlations move a fraction of the single - particle strength to higher missing energies and momenta and , hence , beyond the ranges covered in the integrations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transp ] ) . without going into details ,",
    "theoretical predictions are obtained in a similar way from the ratio of distorted - wave calculations to plane - wave ones . in fig .",
    "[ fig.:neutrinotransp ] , the transparencies predicted by the rmsga and the rdwia models are displayed as a function of @xmath176 for @xmath0c and @xmath1fe , together with the world data extracted from @xmath7 .",
    "solid ( dot - dashed ) lines show the @xmath7 results within rmsga ( rdwia ) .",
    "details about the calculations can be found in ref .",
    "the dashed ( rmsga ) and dotted ( rdwia ) curves correspond to the computed @xmath177 transparencies , obtained using the same procedure as for electron scattering .",
    "this procedure includes the computation of rdwia and rpwia cross sections at @xmath178 , averaged over the same phase space used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transp ] ) .",
    "as can be seen , within each model the neutrino transparencies agree quite well with their electron counterparts .",
    "this result clearly illustrates the fact that _ in our models _ the average attenuation effect of the nuclear medium on the emerging nucleon is rather independent of the nature of the leptonic probe .",
    "adopting the idea that the nuclear transparency for electrons equals the one for neutrinos , the information obtained about nucleon propagation via @xmath7 can be used to predict the effects of fsi mechanisms in inclusive qe @xmath3-nucleus cross sections . as the transparency is essentially the ratio of cross sections including fsi to the ones in the plane - wave limit ,",
    "this will be done by multiplying the rpwia results for neutrino - nucleus cross sections with the measured transparency factors extracted from @xmath7 . in this scenario ,",
    "the benchmark rpwia neutrino - nucleus cross sections are crucial .",
    "it is important to realize that we use transparency factors that are confined to @xmath172 , while the computation of the inclusive neutrino - nucleus cross section include the full phase - space .        in fig .",
    "[ fig.:fe56nc ] , the dashed and dot - dashed lines represent the inclusive cc @xmath3-nucleus cross section within rmsga and rdwia , respectively .",
    "the solid curve displays our corresponding rpwia calculation , scaled with a constant factor taken as a representative value for the experimental @xmath7 transparency for the nucleus . for @xmath0c ( @xmath1fe ) we take @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) . in extracting these values ,",
    "we have corrected the measured transparencies from fig .",
    "[ fig.:neutrinotransp ] with the factor @xmath173 .",
    "a very good agreement is observed between the rescaled rpwia and the full rdwia / rmsga curves in the case of @xmath0c .",
    "this finding supports the idea that a simple scaling of the rpwia results with a transparency factor obtained from electron scattering data allows one to reliably estimate the fsi effects for the quasi - elastic contribution to the inclusive neutrino cross section .",
    "the fact that for @xmath1fe the agreement is less satisfactory reflects the fact that our models slightly underestimate the @xmath1fe transparency data .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig.:totalcross ] displays the total cross section ( @xmath181 ) for @xmath0c@xmath182 and @xmath1fe@xmath182 reactions , scaled with the number of neutrons in the target .",
    "results are shown within rpwia and rdwia using a complex optical potential .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the difference between rpwia and rdwia cross sections is approximately given by the experimental transparency factor extracted from @xmath7 at qe kinematics .",
    "furthermore , other important features can be extracted from this figure .",
    "first , the rpwia cross sections scale with the target mass - number . in this way , when rpwia cross sections are required for a heavy nucleus , a very good approximation consists in multiplying this cross section per nucleon by its mass number .",
    "second , the cross sections do not appreciably change from neutrino energies above 2 gev , i.e. the cross sections saturate at high incoming neutrino energies . to finish with , we compare our relativistic calculations with data from various experiments .",
    "the rpwia calculations give a fair account of the neutrino - energy and magnitude of the data .",
    "the rpwia is confined to single - nucleon knockout thereby not including final - state interaction effects .",
    "the rdwia calculations , on the other hand , including fsi effects via the introduction of an optical potential , considerably underestimate the data .",
    "the results contained in fig .",
    "[ fig.:totalcross ] indicate that at least @xmath183 of the measured @xmath184 strength can be attributed to single - step ( `` elastic '' ) nucleon knockout to missing energies below 80 mev in the residual a-1 nucleus",
    ". the remaining fraction of about @xmath183 could be attributed to multi - nucleon knockout , pion production with subsequent reabsorption , single - nucleon knockout to more complex states , ... .",
    "adding all these contributions would move the calculations closer to the data .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the importance of these missing channels can be estimated in a model in which both the single - particle bound - states and scattering states are computed in a real mean - field potential obtained in the hartree approximation to the @xmath185 model . such an extreme mean - field model ( here coined as rmf )",
    "involves no imaginary potential and accordingly the loss of single - nucleon knockout strength into `` inelastic '' nucleon - knockout channels is effectively reintroduced . as can be appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig.:totalcross ] , the presence of a real potential reduces the rpwia single - nucleon knockout strength , but the global reduction with respect to rpwia is much smaller compared to the @xmath186 in the rdwia / rmsga frameworks .",
    "it is remarkable that the energy dependence of the cross section is identical in all three relativistic frameworks adopted here .",
    "the magnitude , on the other hand , depends strongly on the model used to account for fsi mechanisms .",
    "this reinforces our suggestion that one could use rpwia results to predict the `` elastic '' single - nucleon knockout contribution to inclusive neutrino cross sections , provided that they are rescaled with a transparency factor extracted from @xmath7 data .",
    "we have employed two relativistic models , rmsga and rdwia , to study nc and cc quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "results have been presented for carbon and iron targets , covering a wide range of neutrino energies . within rpwia",
    "both models provide nearly identical results , which deviate from existing rpwia predictions .",
    "the fact that two independently developed codes that adopt very different numerical techniques agree in this limit , together with the fact that our rpwia predictions approach the rfg model at high energies , give us confidence that our rpwia calculations serve as benchmark results .",
    "we subsequently computed the effects of fsi mechanisms within the rmsga and rdwia models .",
    "the two ways of dealing with fsi are consistent down to remarkably low outgoing nucleon kinetic energies of about 200 mev .",
    "fsi produce a large reduction of the cross sections , that increases with the mass number of the target nucleus .",
    "finally , we have illustrated that the nuclear transparencies extracted from @xmath7 measurements can be used to estimate the effect of fsi mechanisms on the elastic single - nucleon knockout contribution to the inclusive neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "extensions of our models include the implementation of pion production and delta resonance .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",

    "<S> we present quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections in the energy range from 150 mev up to 5 gev for the target nuclei @xmath0c and @xmath1fe . a relativistic description of the nuclear dynamics and the neutrino - nucleus coupling is adopted . for the treatment of final - state interactions ( fsi ) we rely on two frameworks succesfully applied to exclusive electron - nucleus scattering : a relativistic optical potential and a relativistic multiple - scattering glauber approximation . at lower energies , </S>",
    "<S> the optical - potential approach is considered to be the optimum choice , whereas at high energies a glauber approach is more natural . comparing the results of both calculations </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the glauber approach yields valid results down to the remarkably small nucleon kinetic energies of 200 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the nuclear transparencies extracted from @xmath2 measurements can be used to obtain realistic estimates of the effect of fsi mechanisms on quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we present two independent relativistic plane - wave impulse approximation ( rpwia ) calculations of quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> they agree at the percent level , showing the reliability of the numerical techniques adopted and providing benchmark rpwia results . </S>"
