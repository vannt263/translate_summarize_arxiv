    "the physical origin of this nonmonotonic damping , that is reflected in an undamping of rabi rotations at high pulse areas , is the resonant nature of the carrier - phonon interaction @xcite : the exciton - phonon coupling is maximal at intermediate pulse areas , where the frequencies of the electronic oscillations are resonant with the most strongly coupled lattice modes .    in experimental studies , the final qd occupation after a pulse",
    "is often measured using a photocurrent detection technique , @xcite where under the action of an applied electric field , the carriers , that have been created during the exciting pulse , tunnel from the qd resulting in a photocurrent . for an exciton - biexciton system , this photocurrent is proportional to the weighted sum @xmath100 of the generated single exciton and biexciton populations . in the following , we will concentrate on this total electronic occupation instead of the single contributions @xmath89 or @xmath90 that in experiments are much harder to extract individually .    plotted in fig .",

    "for the four - level case , the maximal signal is not only twice as high as in the two - level case ( mind the scaling factor of 0.5 for @xmath104 ) but the pulse area with minimal amplitude , marking the beginning of the reappearance , is also considerably higher .",

    "depending on the total laser intensity , we can then encounter two situations : either @xmath144 and the @xmath136 driven subsystem experiences a weaker damping than in the case of an equally strong linear driving [ which is fulfilled for the driving strength of @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] , or @xmath145 and the damping of the @xmath135 driven subsystem is less strong . in any case , one subsystem experiences a weaker damping than in the linear case , which results in a weaker damping of the total electronic occupation , to which both subsystems contribute . from this reasoning",
    "it follows straightforwardly that for elliptically polarized excitations the difference of the damping compared to the linear case should monotonically increase with rising ellipticity , which is indeed confirmed by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    for elliptical polarizations close to the circular limit , the carrier dynamics in one subsystem experiences eventually hardly any damping and @xmath104 oscillates with large amplitudes over a long time - interval . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) this is nicely illustrated for @xmath133 ( blue dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "first , the signal rapidly oscillates .",
    "however , after roughly 20  ps these fast oscillations have decayed .",
    "subsequently , the dynamics changes qualitatively and is dominated by oscillations with a much longer period that are only weakly damped . while the fast oscillations reflect the dynamics in the @xmath135 driven subsystem , the much less damped oscillations with a longer period stem from the @xmath136 driven subsystem . as for the chosen polarization",
    "@xmath70 is roughly ten times smaller than @xmath69 , the oscillations in the @xmath136 driven subsystem reveal a roughly ten times longer period and experience a considerably less damping , because here @xmath146 .",
    "this characteristic change in the dynamics is also expressed in corresponding results for pulsed excitations , cf .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the limit of a strictly circular polarization with @xmath147 is special : for this excitation condition , one subsystem is driven with the total intensity , while the other subsystem is not driven at all . in consequence , while for almost circularly polarized light the damping seen in the oscillations of the total occupation decreases with rising ellipticity and the time to become stationary rises without any limit for @xmath148 , this time is finite for circularly polarized light as discussed in more detail in figs .",

    "( [ eq_hfull])-([eq_matrixm ] ) and in the limiting case @xmath52 discussed so far . in the phonon - free case , it is easily seen that for @xmath52 the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq_hfull])-([eq_matrixm ] ) can be decomposed into a product of two two - level systems , each evolving on its bloch sphere with a rabi frequency given by @xmath138 or @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "thus , in this case we have two subsystems that evolve independently and react separately either on the values of @xmath138 or @xmath139 . in a four - level system composed of two independent two - level systems each coupled to phonons , the phonon coupling of the two - exciton state must necessarily be twice the exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "although this necessary condition is fulfilled in the exciton - biexciton system studied so far , we are actually not dealing with strictly independent dynamics on two bloch - spheres as the two spheres are coupled to the same phonon modes .",
    "the resulting interdependence of the dynamics on the two bloch spheres can be seen , e.g. , from the fact that for linearly polarized driving the stationary biexciton occupation reached at long times is not given by @xmath149 ( which would be the product of the stationary values of @xmath150 reached in any of the @xmath32 coupled two - level systems ) but 1/3 .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , even though a strict factorization into two independently evolving subsystems does not hold , a phonon - coupling of the biexciton state @xmath151 of exactly twice the exciton phonon - coupling @xmath152 realizes a distinguished situation as in this case the phonon induced damping rates depend on @xmath138 and @xmath139 separately . however , this property is lost , when either @xmath153 or when the biexciton binding energy or the exchange interaction take finite values , or when the dipole moments associated with the ground state exciton transition @xmath154 and the exciton biexciton transition @xmath155 are different . in each of these cases terms involving @xmath156 or @xmath157 enter the equations derived within the weak coupling theory .",
    "it turns out , however , that for many typical situations with deviations from the limiting case discussed so far , the amplitudes of the additional terms are small and the polarization dependence is still close to the results shown in fig .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and shall be discussed in the remainder of the paper .    in real systems",
    ", @xmath155 differs from @xmath154 due to deviations from the strict strong confinement limit , where the multi - pair wave functions factorize in single particle wave functions for electrons and holes .",
    "typical values observed in experiments indicate , that @xmath155 is roughly @xmath158 smaller than @xmath154 .",
    "@xcite for the same reason , @xmath159 is possible .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) show results for calculations assuming @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively , for the same polarizations as in fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that the polarization dependence is only weakly influenced by these deviations from the strong confinement limit .",
    "we have also performed calculations ( not shown ) accounting for a finite exchange interaction of @xmath162ev , which represents a typical value .",
    "although @xmath13 yields a direct coupling of the two subspaces driven by @xmath32 polarized light , we found only very small changes compared to @xmath43 , except for strict circular polarization @xcite or in the regime of nearly circularly polarized excitations , when the time - scale on which the total system is driven to a stationary state increases drastically and exceeds @xmath163 .",
    "finally , let us turn to the influence of finite values of the biexciton binding energy , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](d ) for @xmath164 and @xmath111  mev , respectively . at first",
    "one may notice that the mean value of the oscillations decreases with rising ellipticity of the polarization .",
    "this lowering of the total signal is due to the fact , that the biexciton generation becomes more unlikely , when @xmath70 decreases , as in this case the exciton biexciton transition given an exciton generated by @xmath135 polarized light becomes less probable .",
    "in addition , there is no longer a cross - over between fast and slow oscillations for almost circularly polarized excitations .",
    "however , despite these differences compared to the case of a vanishing biexciton binding energy , we find a very similar behavior as discussed so far : the decay of the oscillation amplitude is the less pronounced the more far the excitation is from the linear case , clearly illustrating a strong dependence of the phonon - induced damping on the polarization of the driving laser light .",
    "this picture changes , however , for larger @xmath12 , which are still feasible , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) for @xmath165 mev . here",
    ", the polarization dependence is drastically suppressed .",
    "as the coupling to the biexciton decreases with rising @xmath12 , this indicates , that an efficient coupling to the biexciton is of fundamental importance for the polarization dependence of the damping .",
    "indeed , when we completely decouple the biexciton from the dynamics by setting by hand @xmath166 , then the polarization dependence vanishes altogether and the phonon - induced damping is fully determined by the pulse intensity [ cf .",
    "[ fig4](f ) , where all four lines coincide ] .",
    "only when the biexciton is coupled , there is the possibility to essentially drive two different bloch spheres with individual rabi frequencies within the four - level system considered here , giving rise to the polarization dependence of the phonon - induced damping as explained above .",
    "in summary , we have presented a numerically complete analysis of the phonon impact on optically driven exciton - biexciton qd systems .",
    "rabi rotation scenarios for finite biexciton binding energies were shown to differ significantly from the two - level case and offer manifold insights in the dynamics of an exciton - biexciton system , including the interplay between off - resonant driving and quantum dissipative relaxation .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated that although the carrier - phonon interaction is independent of the spin , the phonon - induced damping does not only depend on the pulse intensity but is for typical parameters also strongly affected by the polarization of the driving laser pulse . while the damping is strongest for linearly polarized excitations , it is the more reduced the closer the polarization is to the circular limit . for almost circularly polarized excitations and small biexciton binding energies ,",
    "the rabi scenario changes strongly in the course of time reflecting different dynamics in the @xmath32 driven subsystems .",
    "the origin of the polarization dependent phonon - induced damping is the possibility to drive two bloch spheres essentially each with its own rabi - frequency @xmath53 that are determined by the polarization , together with the fact that it is the rabi frequency that determines the damping in a two - level system .",
    "this possibility is intimately related to an efficient coupling to the biexciton state , which highlights the pivotal role of this two - pair state for the discussed dynamics .",
