    "the study of the formation of the milky way galaxy is entering a new era , with the advent of very large surveys of the kinematics and chemical compositions of galactic stellar populations with sample sizes ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 stars , such as rave @xcite , brava @xcite , segue @xcite , lamost @xcite , gaia @xcite , gaia - eso @xcite , argos @xcite , 4most @xcite , galah @xcite , and weave @xcite .",
    "ten years from today , our picture of the galaxy we live in , and with it our understanding of its formation , will be profoundly influenced , if not radically revised , by these major observational projects .",
    "these various surveys cover different stellar populations within different regions of the galaxy .",
    "they span a range in resolution and spectral coverage , and they yield chemical compositions with different precisions and accuracies .",
    "patching together the various pieces of this large mosaic to compose a unified view of the galaxy , the ultimate goal motivating all these surveys , will be a complex and challenging endeavor .",
    "understanding all sources of uncertainties , both random and systematic , of the chemical abundances delivered by each of these surveys will be key for the success of this enterprise .",
    "in contrast to these optical surveys , the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stands out due to its focus on collecting high - resolution h@xmath4band data for @xmath5 giant stars across all stellar populations . because it observes these stars in the near infrared ( nir ) , apogee is able to explore remote",
    ", dust obscured , regions of the galaxy that are beyond the reach of optical surveys . by obtaining high resolution ( r @xmath6 22,500 ) spectra for @xmath5 stars , apogee will estimate accurate abundances for up to 15 elements ( depending on temperature and metallicity ) for a very large sample , and potentially allow a statistically robust assessment of the star formation and chemical enrichment history of all subcomponents of the galaxy .",
    "apogee is one of four sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ) experiments @xcite and is based on the first multi - fiber , high - resolution , nir spectrograph ever built .",
    "this instrument is deployed on the sdss 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory @xcite .",
    "the apogee spectrograph obtains 300 spectra with a resolution of 22,500 on three hawaii-2rg detectors oriented to cover the spectral interval from 15,090 to 16,990  .",
    "the telescope focal plane uses standard sdss plug - plates , where 300 fibers with diameters of 2@xmath7 on the sky are placed on targets within a 3 degree field of view .",
    "the overall goal of s / n @xmath8 100 per pixel can be reached over a 3 hr integration on targets with h=12.2 .",
    "the stability of the spectrograph makes it possible to measure radial velocities to a precision better than 100 m / s . for more details on the spectrograph design and performance ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "commissioning of the apogee spectrograph began in may 2011 , and survey operations started in september of the same year .",
    "the first public release of apogee data took place as part of the tenth sdss data release ( dr10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and includes spectra of all stars observed by july 2012 . altogether , 180,000 spectra of nearly 60,000 stars within 170 fields were released in dr10 .",
    "this release also includes spectra and derived atmospheric parameters ( including @xmath1-elements , carbon , and nitrogen abundances ) ; the abundances of other elements will be made available in a future data release .",
    "sdss - iii survey operations will conclude in the summer of 2014 .",
    "the apogee survey is exploring all stellar components of the milky way galaxy , with particular focus on the previously less well - studied low latitude regions , including the dust - obscured parts of the galactic disk and bulge that are accessible from apache point observatory ( apo , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "apogee targets are selected from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite with various magnitude limits , using a de - reddened color criterion [ @xmath9 , to minimize contamination of the sample by foreground dwarf and subgiant stars , and to ensure sufficiently cool surface temperatures so that abundances can be determined . in most cases ,",
    "final integrations are achieved through 3 to 24 separate approximately one hr visits .",
    "final exposure times are determined to reach the s / n @xmath8 100/pixel requirement .",
    "more details on target selection are given in @xcite .",
    "while the focus on nir spectra of giants makes apogee unique among all other surveys of galactic stellar populations , it presents some challenges for the determination of stellar parameters and abundances and inter - comparing these to results from other surveys .",
    "compared to the optical , the h - band has been relatively unexplored for detailed elemental abundance work , so that the systematic effects intrinsic to standard abundance analyses of high - resolution nir spectra have not yet been subject to a thorough assessment ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , most other surveys are focused on chemical composition studies of dwarf stars .",
    "therefore , sample overlap between apogee and other surveys will be small , making inter - survey zero - point conversions uncertain , and thus requiring a careful alternative mapping of all sources of systematic effects in apogee parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we present an initial study of the accuracy and precision of the primary apogee stellar parameters as available in dr10 .",
    "this is achieved for the basic stellar parameters ( metallicity , surface gravity , and temperature ) using apogee observations of well - studied globular and open clusters that span the parameter space of interest to apogee .",
    "stars in clusters are particularly important in this context due to the profusion in the literature of high quality abundance work dedicated to giant stars in both open and globular clusters @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a steadily growing database of chemical compositions of main sequence stars in clusters , which can in the future be used for understanding the impact of mixing on the abundances of certain elements during post - main sequence evolution .",
    "another important source of fundamental data for calibration of aspcap output is the growing asteroseismic data base made possible by the _",
    "_ satellite @xcite .",
    "asteroseismic data are used as an independent check on aspcap s surface gravities ( see section [ sect : logg ] ) , and provide broad confirmation of the trends identified in the cluster comparisons .",
    "asteroseismic data also provide methods that can be used to test the theoretical isochrones themselves over a range of ages and chemical compositions .",
    "the focus of this paper , however , is on the detailed comparison between aspcap parameters and those obtained by other groups for giant stars in well known galactic clusters and from asteroseismic surface gravities for giants in the _ kepler _ fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the apogee data , the reduction pipeline , the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline , and the kepler asteroseismic sample . in section 3",
    "we present a comparison of aspcap results with data from the literature for stars in common with apogee and derive relations to calibrate one set of parameters into the other .",
    "we derived calibration relations to bring the aspcap parameters into agreement with independent parameter estimates .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "the apogee observations in a given field consist of multiple exposures , each of which yields multiple non - destructive readouts of the nir detectors via the up - the - ramp - sampling method . because the spectra are slightly undersampled at the short wavelength end of the spectrum , exposures are taken in pairs with the detectors physically shifted in the spectral direction by 0.5 pixels between exposures .",
    "the raw data are reduced to well - sampled 1d spectra using a custom pipeline .",
    "the pipeline uses the up - the - ramp data cubes and calibration data ( darks and flats ) to construct a calibrated 2d image for each exposure , extracts the 300 spectra from these 2d images , applies a wavelength calibration , subtracts sky and performs a telluric correction using data from sky fibers and fibers placed on hot stars .",
    "it also assembles well - sampled spectra from the dither pairs , and applies flux calibration .",
    "data from multiple visits to the same field on different nights are combined after determination of the relative rvs of the different observations . along with the final spectra",
    ", the pipeline produces error and mask arrays , rvs of the individual visits , and a number of intermediate data products .",
    "spectra from the 3 apogee detectors are combined together into one file , but continuum - normalized separately from each other .",
    "calibration lamps and sky lines are used to obtain measurements of the line spread function .",
    "these yield a typical fwhm resolving power of @xmath622,500 , although there are some variations , at the @xmath610% level , with location on the chip and with wavelength .",
    "more details about the data reduction pipeline and the instrument performance will be given by @xcite .",
    "the outputs from the data reduction pipeline are fed to the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ) .",
    "this pipeline already uses simultaneously the spectra from the 3 detectors .",
    "details of pipeline operation and performance tests will be described in a future paper , but we summarize the basic principles here .",
    "aspcap searches a precomputed grid of synthetic spectra for the combination of atmospheric parameters consisting of effective temperature ( t@xmath10 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath11 ) , metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) , carbon ( [ c / m ] ) , nitrogen ( [ n / m ] ) , and @xmath1 ( [ @xmath1/m ] ) abundances associated with a synthetic spectrum that best reproduces the observed pseudo - continuum - normalized fluxes .",
    "the abundance of each individual element x heavier than helium , is defined as    @xmath12 = \\log_{10}(n_x / n_h)_{\\rm star } - \\log_{10}(n_x / n_h)_\\odot\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the number of atoms of element x and hydrogen , per unit volume in the stellar photosphere .",
    "we define [ m / h ] as an overall scaling of metal abundances with a solar abundance pattern , and [ x / m ] as the deviation of element x from the solar abundance pattern :    @xmath15 = [ x / h ] - [ m / h ] \\label{eqn : mh}\\ ] ]    in the current version of aspcap , [ c / m ] , [ n / m ] , [ @xmath1/m ] are allowed to vary because these elements are seen to depart from the solar abundance pattern and also because a substantial part of the line opacity in the h band is sensitive to those abundances , particularly due to the presence of thousands of lines from cn , oh , and co molecules .",
    "the @xmath1 elements considered in apogee are the following : o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , and ti . for all other elements",
    ", we presently set [ x / m ] = 0 , but intend to extend the analysis to additional species in future releases .",
    "additional explanations of our metallicity definition can be found in section 3.2 .",
    "aspcap has two main parts . at its core",
    ", the fortran90 code ferre performs the parameter search by evaluating the differences between observed and model fluxes by interpolation on a grid of pre - computed spectra .",
    "the remainder of the pipeline , which we refer to as the idl wrapper , reads and prepares the reduced apogee spectra for ferre , executes the code , and collects and writes the output into fits tables . for each input spectrum ,",
    "a first pass derives the main atmospheric parameters mentioned above , and a second pass determines individual chemical abundances , although only the first is currently operational .",
    "the long - range goal is to exploit the rich chemical information content in each apogee spectrum to derive abundances for approximately 15 elements , but presently only the outputs of the first pass , namely , overall metallicity and the abundances of @xmath1 elements , carbon , and nitrogen , are being determined .",
    "ferre has evolved from the code used by @xcite , and implements a number of optimization and interpolation algorithms .",
    "the merit function for the optimization is a straight @xmath16 criterion .",
    "the grids of model fluxes on which the code interpolates are stored in memory or in a database , with the former solution being typically faster . with about 10@xmath17 wavelength bins represented in the order of 10@xmath18 models , the model grids used by aspcap are massive .",
    "ferre performs 12 searches for each input spectrum .",
    "these are initialized at the center of the grid for [ c / m ] , [ n / m ] and [ @xmath1/m ] , at two different places symmetrically located from the grid center for [ m / h ] and @xmath11 , and at three for t@xmath10 .",
    "random contributions to the error bars are calculated by inverting the curvature matrix following the discussion in @xcite .",
    "ferre is parallelized using openmp .",
    "aspcap fits model spectra to observations in normalized flux .",
    "the idl wrapper normalizes independently the sections of the reduced spectra falling on each of the three detectors . because for the cool stars that apogee mainly observes the continuum is uncertain , aspcap relies on applying the same continuum normalization procedure to both model and observed spectra .",
    "the code iteratively fits a polynomial and sigma - clips points above and below thresholds to the spectra , observed and model , in the same fashion that it is traditionally done for observations .",
    "the three spectra are combined after this normalization .",
    "aspcap groups the observed stars according to four broad spectral classes , each with an associated model library .",
    "the purpose of splitting the libraries by effective temperature is simply to keep the size of grids manageable .",
    "the wrapper manages the execution of ferre jobs for each class , and combines the output by selecting the best solution for each spectrum processed through multiple searches .",
    "finally , the resulting parameters , error covariance matrices , best - fitting spectra , and other relevant quantities are stored in compact fits files .",
    "the libraries of model stellar spectra currently in use have been calculated using kurucz model atmospheres @xcite , up - to - date continuum @xcite and line opacities , and the spectral synthesis code ass@xmath19 t @xcite .",
    "all model atmospheres were constructed with a constant value for the microturbulence of 2.0 km s@xmath20 , and solar abundance ratios scaled to the metallicity for all metals .",
    "in contrast , a wide range of microturbulence values and abundance ratios for [ c / m ] , [ n / m ] and [ @xmath1/m ] were adopted for the spectral synthesis calculations . however , for dr10 results , a relation between micro - turbulent velocity and surface gravity ( @xmath21 ) was found to describe well the results from fitting with 7 parameters ( the usual six and microturbulence ) , and adopted for subsequent work .",
    "future plans are to use consistent atmospheres with non - solar abundance ratios to match those used for the spectral synthesis based on model atmospheres calculated by @xcite .",
    "the line list adopted for the aspcap analysis includes both atomic and molecular species .",
    "the molecular line list , compiled from literature sources , included : co , oh , cn , c@xmath22 , h@xmath22 , and sih .",
    "all of the molecular data were adopted from the literature without modifications with the exception of a few obvious typographical corrections .",
    "the original atomic line list was compiled from a number of literature sources and includes theoretical , astrophysical , and laboratory oscillator strength values .",
    "once we had what we considered to be our best literature atomic values , we allowed the transition wavelengths , oscillator strengths , and damping constants to vary to fit to the solar spectrum .",
    "for this purpose we used a customized version of the lte spectral synthesis code moog @xcite .    for this work ,",
    "two libraries were used : one spanning span spectral types from early - m to k - type stars ( @xmath23  k ) , and the other covering g and early - f type stars ( @xmath24  k ) .",
    "apogee observed 20 open and globular clusters during the first year of survey operations , partly for calibration purposes .",
    "the calibration clusters were selected to span a wide range of metallicities and also to have well - measured abundances from previous studies .",
    "table 1 lists these calibration clusters , along with the adopted [ m / h ] , e(@xmath25 ) , and age from the literature . for the open and globular clusters ,",
    "targets were selected as cluster members if 1 ) there was published abundance information on the star as a cluster member , 2 ) they were radial velocity members , or 3 ) if they had a probability @xmath850% of being a cluster member based on their proper motions . for stars with existing abundance measurements and atmospheric parameters ,",
    "the references are provided in table 1 .",
    "the cluster target selection is described in more detail by @xcite .",

    "in addition , we removed any stars that had a significantly different metallicity ( usually @xmath80.3  dex , or about 3 @xmath27 ) from the aspcap average , or if the position of the star on the hr diagram was far from the rgb . based on these criteria ,",
    "about 90% of the originally selected stars were adopted as cluster members .    for the discussion on the accuracy and precision of the derived parameters ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to stars with s / n @xmath8 70 ( where s / n is determined per pixel in the final combined spectrum , which has @xmath6 3 pixels per resolution element ) , as tests carried out with aspcap indicate that this value is the minimum required to derive reliable stellar parameters .",
    "the analysis was also restricted to giant stars with @xmath11 @xmath28 3.5 , because most of the stars observed in the calibration of clusters are evolved ; we stress that _ all _ calibrations presented in section 3 apply only to stars with @xmath11 @xmath28 3.5 .",
    "dwarfs were observed in only two clusters , m35 and the pleiades ; therefore , because both of these clusters have near - solar metallicity , there is insufficient information to determine the accuracy of aspcap parameters for dwarfs outside the solar metallicity regime .",

    "in addition to the apogee observations of cluster stars , we also tested the results of aspcap and the adopted line list by analyzing four bright , well - studied stars that have high resolution ( varied from r = 45,000 to 100,000 ) , near - ir spectra obtained via the kitt peak national observatory fourier transform spectrometer on the mayall 4-m telescope @xcite .",

    "this effect is likely caused by correlated errors in metallicity and @xmath1 abundances for ngc  6791 .",
    "the carbon and nitrogen abundance comparisons with literature values are shown in figure [ fig : cn ] ; table 1 lists the references used for the literature values .",
    "carbon abundances are significantly overestimated for globular clusters ( up to 1  dex ) , while for open clusters the agreement is better between [ c / m ] = @xmath40.5 and 0 .",
    "nitrogen abundances are generally underestimated compared to other studies by about 0.2@xmath40.4  dex at low nitrogen content , and up to 1  dex for stars with high nitrogen content .",
    "the overestimate of [ n / m ] at high [ c / m ] values may be a consequence of deriving nitrogen from cn : if aspcap underestimates [ c / m ] ( as shown in the upper panel for [ c / m ] @xmath8 0 ) , [ n / m ] will thus be overestimated .",
    "we note that these comparisons are affected by the relative paucity of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] data for cluster stars in the literature and by their intrinsic uncertainties , particularly in the case of nitrogen .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to decide how much of the large scatter and zero point differences seen in figure [ fig : cn ] is contributed by the apogee data , and how much by the literature data .",
    "because of this uncertainty , we suggest that the current carbon and nitrogen abundances derived by aspcap be used with extreme caution . while the uncertainties in the c and n abundances may contribute to systematic effects in other derived parameters , in ways that are still not entirely understood , these possible systematics have been approximately removed by the calibration process presented in this paper .",
    "thus , we expect the calibrated values for effective temperature , surface gravities , metallicities , and @xmath1-element abundances to be free of any important systematic effects .",
    "we believe that by defining certain spectral windows in the h - band for all these elements , along with other aspcap improvements , is likely to significantly improve the quality of the abundance determinations for these elements .",
    "aspcap provides formal internal error estimates for stellar parameters that are presently unrealistically small .",
    "the scatter within individual clusters offers an external estimate of uncertainties , which we adopt for t@xmath10 and metallicity .",
    "the precision of the effective temperatures was calculated using the differences compared to the @xmath71 calibrations .",
    "any systematic shifts were neglected by fitting a constant value to the differences .",
    "the error in temperature for each cluster was then calculated by determining the rms scatter around this fit .",
    "the calculated uncertainties are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : err ] , and listed in table 4 .",
    "the overall scatter in temperature is less than 200  k , but it appears to be significantly better for metal - rich stars , where it is generally smaller than 100  k. a linear fit was used to characterize how the precision depends on metallicity , and the following function was adopted to estimate the aspcap temperature errors :    @xmath72_a + 83.8   \\label{eqn : terr}\\ ] ]    where [ m / h]@xmath60 is the raw aspcap metallicity . the equation is valid for stars with @xmath11 @xmath28 3.5 .    , [ @xmath1/m ] and t@xmath10 for each cluster ( based on stars with @xmath11 @xmath28 3.5 ) as a function of uncorrected cluster average metallicity from aspcap .",
    "a linear empirical calibration was used in case of effective temperature and metallicity .",
    "see section 3.5 for discussion .",
    ", width=432 ]    the rms scatter of metallicity , shown by circles in the left panel of figure [ fig : err ] , was again determined by calculating the standard deviation around the cluster average values .",
    "the scatter in metallicity , in the range 0.08@xmath40.14 dex for globular clusters , is higher for the most metal - poor clusters .",
    "for all the open clusters , with a nearly solar metallicity , the scatter is smaller , at about 0.03@xmath40.07 dex .",
    "the average scatter using all clusters is 0.09  dex .",
    "there is one outlier cluster , m107 , in which the scatter is 0.21  dex .",
    "this might be the result of possible uncertainties in metallicity above 5000  k , due to increased temperature offsets from photometric values .",
    "all other derived atmospheric parameters for m107 behave just like the other globular clusters .",
    "the rms for the ensemble of clusters clearly depends on the metallicity , thus again a linear equation was used to estimate the aspcap metallicity errors :    @xmath56_{rms } = -0.0361 \\ [ m / h]_a + 0.0548   \\label{eqn : merr}\\ ] ]    the equation is valid for stars with @xmath11 @xmath28 3.5 .",
    "the rms of the @xmath1 abundances , shown as squares in the left panel of figure [ fig : err ] , are relatively low , of the order of 0.1 dex .",
    "similarly to the metallicity , the @xmath1 precision gets worse with decreasing metallicity due to the metallicity-@xmath1 correlation found in the globular clusters . near solar metallicities",
    ", the typical error spans between 0.02 and 0.07  dex , with no systematic deviations as a function of metallicity or temperature .",
    "because the rms increases due to systematics in the metallicity-@xmath1 correlation , we do not fit the rms the of @xmath1 abundances .",
    "we believe that the true random error of @xmath1 is smaller than what is presented for the metal - poor stars .",
    "we plan several improvements in how we will obtain the physical parameters for apogee s next data release ( dr12 , planned for december 2014 ) .",
    "this section provides an overview on those ongoing developments .",
    "the model atmospheres used in the current ( dr10 ) version of aspcap are those published by @xcite based on the atlas9 code @xcite .",
    "we have recently produced an updated grid of model atmospheres based on the most recent version of atlas9 @xcite , including an updated h@xmath22 line list .",
    "the new grid of models considers , in addition to the usual variations in metal abundance , variations in @xmath1-element enhancement and carbon abundance [ c / m ] , which will lead to a spectral library with consistent abundances between the synthesis and the model atmospheres .",
    "the [ @xmath1/m]@xmath4[m / h ] correlation found in metal - poor and metal - rich clusters can be improved by separating iron lines from oh lines and fitting them separately .",
    "this will lead to a more simple fit , where in the first step the metallicity is determined from iron lines , and in a second step @xmath1 abundances can be derived from oh , and other @xmath1-element lines .",
    "we have clearly shown that our spectroscopic surface gravities differ systematically from those derived from isochrones or stellar oscillations .",
    "one or several of the many approximations involved in the calculation of model spectra are likely behind these systematic errors .",
    "departures from lte , enhanced by the low densities found in the atmospheres of giant stars , could be affecting some of the atomic populations .",
    "molecular populations are quite sensitive to the thermal structure in high atmospheric layers , and also to thermal inhomogeneities that must be present in the real stars , and these are completely neglected in our 1d model atmospheres , and the main suspect for the observed systematic offsets .",
    "we have already started to look at how to bring aspcap gravities into better agreement with asteroseismic gravities .",
    "grids of hydrodynamical model atmospheres are becoming available , and we plan to examine their impact on the h - band spectrum of giants in the near future @xcite .",
    "we have also noticed that the brackett series lines in the spectra , which are fairly sensitive to pressure , are not always well matched by our model spectra , and their modeling may need to be revised .",
    "while the overall size of the differences between our spectroscopic gravities and those from isochrones or pulsations are similar , we have identified some discrepancies when comparing aspcap surface gravities with these two independent sources .",
    "we will examine closely these inconsistencies to identify the reasons behind them . among the candidates we plan on exploring are the effects of the mixing length and other convection parameters as well as the helium content in the construction of stellar evolution models .",
    "we will also closely evaluate the applicability of the adopted scaling relationship between the frequency of maximum power of oscillations ( @xmath73 ) and the surface gravity .",
    "the aspcap analysis has so far been restricted to the main atmospheric parameters and the abundances of c , n and overall abundances of @xmath1-elements and metals .",
    "we are further developing aspcap to handle the derivation of abundances for many more elements accessible from the h - band .",
    "our preliminary studies indicated that up to 15 different elements are well represented in this spectral window for late - type giant stars @xcite .",
    "as part of these improvements , a manual analysis is being carried out for a number of the aspcap calibration clusters .",
    "these analyses will include derivations of the fundamental atmospheric parameters themselves , as well as measuring the additional 15 elements that are part of the apogee survey plan .",
    "these results will be used to further refine and calibrate the aspcap pipeline .",
    "we have used data of 559 stars belonging to 20 galactic globular and open clusters or with high - quality asteroseismic data to determine the accuracy and precision of atmospheric parameters published in dr10 .",
    "the apogee spectra were run through the current version of the apogee stellar parameters and stellar abundances pipeline ( aspcap ) , and cluster members were selected carefully to compare effective temperature , metallicity , surface gravity , @xmath1-elements , carbon and nitrogen abundances to literature values .",
    "effective temperature : effective temperatures agree well with spectroscopic temperatures from the literature within a mean offset of 8@xmath26161  k. for photometric temperatures , larger systematic differences can be seen .",
    "a correction function was provided to convert aspcap temperatures to the photometric scale of @xcite , which is based on the irfm method .",
    "the precision of aspcap temperatures was estimated using the rms scatter of the clusters , and it is found to be about 150@xmath4200  k in globular clusters , and 50@xmath4100  k in open clusters at solar metallicities .",
    "metallicity : aspcap metallicities agree very well ( to within 0.1  dex ) with literature values for stars with @xmath74 [ m / h ] @xmath75  dex . at both",
    "the metal - poor and metal - rich ends of the scale , systematic differences are apparent , amounting up to 0.2@xmath40.3  dex .",
    "an empirical correction is provided using literature cluster averages to bring aspcap metallicities into agreement with the literature values .",
    "the metallicity scatter in each individual cluster is usually less than 0.15  dex , while the average scatter in all 20 clusters is 0.09  dex .",
    "gravity : aspcap gravities are larger by about 0.2@xmath40.3  dex than both isochrones and seismic values for metallicity in the range @xmath74 [ m / h ] @xmath75  dex . at lower metallicities",
    "the difference is larger .",
    "an empirical correction is provided based on a combined data set including isochrone comparisons for metal - poor stars and _ kepler _ seismic values at solar metallicities .",
    "@xmath1 abundances : [ @xmath1/m ] abundances for stars within @xmath74 [ m / h ] @xmath75  dex show no dependence on temperature , or metallicity . however , a clear correlation exists with [ m / h ] and t@xmath10 outside this metallicity range , thus we advice to use @xmath1 abundances with caution for stars with @xmath76 [ m / h ] and @xmath77  dex .",
    "the typical precision in the above mentioned region is less than 0.07  dex .",
    "in addition , we are not confident on the derived [ @xmath1/m ] results for @xmath78  k.    carbon and nitrogen : the carbon and nitrogen abundances show significant systematic differences ( up to 1  dex ) compared to literature values .",
    "we currently discourage any use of those values in scientific applications .",
    "further developments of aspcap will be available in the near future and aim to reduce the systematic effects seen in metallicity and gravity .",
    "the new data set with improved atmospheric parameters will be available in dr12 , at the end of 2014 .",
    "continued improvements in the processing and analysis of apogee spectra will no doubt be one of the highest priorities for the apogee team in the upcoming years .",
