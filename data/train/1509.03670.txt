    "[ fig : otwo ] ]    the first question is whether the absorption feature seen at @xmath53  ghz in the vla spectrum of pks1830@xmath221  arises from o@xmath0  or from ch@xmath6cho ( or , indeed , some other transition )",

    "* ) , i.e. @xmath62 . for @xmath63  k , the 424  ghz line is expected to be slightly stronger than the 56  ghz line , @xmath64 .",
    "our alma @xmath3 limit on the integrated o@xmath0  424  ghz optical depth is @xmath65  km  s@xmath31 , a factor of 5 lower than the integrated optical depth ( @xmath66  km  s@xmath31 ) of the 29.836  ghz absorption feature in the vla spectrum .",
    "we can thus conclusively rule out the possibility that the vla absorption feature arises from the o@xmath0  56  ghz transition .",
    "the feature is most likely to arise from the ch@xmath6cho @xmath67e transition .",
    "interestingly , the two ch@xmath6cho transitions ( @xmath67  e and @xmath70  a@xmath71 ) seen in the vla spectrum at , respectively , 29.836  ghz and 29.793  ghz , have the same line strengths .",
    "one can hence subtract one from the other to search for any additional absorption arising from the o@xmath0  56  ghz line .",
    "this was done by using two - point interpolation to resample the ch@xmath6cho @xmath70  a@xmath71 line profile at the measured velocities of the ch@xmath6cho @xmath67  e line , and then subtracting out the resampled line profile from the latter spectrum .",
    "this procedure is unlikely to yield any systematic effects , as both ch@xmath6cho line profiles are well - sampled , with at least 3 independent spectral points detected at @xmath72 significance .",
    "no absorption is detected in the residual vla spectrum , yielding an integrated o@xmath0  56  ghz optical depth of @xmath73  km  s@xmath31 , again at @xmath3 significance , against the s - w component of pks1830@xmath221 . again using @xmath68",
    "k , this yields @xmath74  @xmath5 , a factor of @xmath75 more stringent than the alma upper limit .",
    "the h@xmath0  column density of the @xmath22 lens has been estimated to be @xmath76  @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "these are broadly consistent with estimates of the total hydrogen column density towards both lensed images from chandra and rosat x - ray spectroscopy , n(h )  @xmath77  @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "note that , while @xcite argue that the h@xmath0  column density may be an order of magnitude larger than the above values to account for the detection of species such as hc@xmath78o@xmath79 and hc@xmath80n in absorption , such a high value of @xmath81 appears to be ruled out by the x - ray data . using a value of @xmath82  @xmath5   yields o@xmath0  abundances of @xmath8 and @xmath9 from the vla ( ch@xmath6cho - subtracted ) o@xmath0  56  ghz and the alma o@xmath0  424  ghz non - detections , respectively .",
    "of course , if the higher h@xmath0  column density estimate of @xcite is correct , then our constraints on the o@xmath0  abundance would be more stringent by an order of magnitude , i.e. @xmath83 .    prior to this work , the strongest constraint on the o@xmath0  abundance outside the milky way was @xmath26 in the @xmath23 absorber towards b0218 + 357 ( see section  1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "our vla upper limit on the o@xmath0  abundance in the @xmath27 absorber towards pks1830@xmath221  is a factor of @xmath84 lower than this , and comparable to the measured o@xmath0  abundance towards the orion h@xmath0 peak  1 @xcite .",
    "however , our limit is nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than the constraints on , or measurements of , o@xmath0  abundances in the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the high gas kinetic temperatures in the two gravitational lenses , @xmath85  k in the @xmath86 absorber and @xmath87  k in the @xmath88 absorber , imply that it will not be easy to improve upon our present constraint and achieve an o@xmath0  abundance sensitivity comparable to those in the milky way",
    ".    while our o@xmath0  abundance constraints for the @xmath1 absorber are less stringent than those in the galaxy , these are by far the most sensitive constraints in an external galaxy .",
    "further , the galactic estimates stem from emission studies with differing angular resolution in the o@xmath0  and co lines .",
    "the derived abundances are hence an average over multiple molecular clouds with different excitation conditions ; this can imply large uncertainties in @xmath89 , of upto two orders of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resolution of the present interferometric absorption study is determined by the size of the background radio continuum at the observing frequency . for pks1830@xmath221 ,",
    "the emission from the s - w image at high frequencies ( @xmath90  ghz ) arises in a compact source of size  @xmath91  mas @xcite , i.e. transverse size @xmath92  pc at @xmath29 .",
    "the o@xmath0  abundance estimates are hence likely to be reliable here , as both the o@xmath0  and the h@xmath0  column densities are inferred from absorption studies probing the same pencil beam towards the s - w image .",
    "finally , it is clear that we rule out o@xmath0  abundances of @xmath93 at @xmath3 significance in the @xmath27 lens towards pks1830@xmath221 .",
    "as noted earlier , the o@xmath0  abundance is expected to reach about this level , comparable to the co abundance , in standard models of molecular chemistry within @xmath94  years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low o@xmath0  abundance thus appears a conundrum , even for the @xmath27 absorber .",
    "a possible explanation lies in the high derived abundance of neutral carbon in this system by @xcite , who obtain n(c)/n(h@xmath0 )  @xmath95 , somewhat larger than the co abundance . in typical molecular clouds ,",
    "o@xmath0  is destroyed by the reactions @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the high carbon abundance in the @xmath27 absorber is thus unfavourable for the survival of o@xmath0 , and can account for its low abundance .",
    "@xcite also note that the high carbon abundance relative to co suggests that the absorbing gas arises in translucent clouds , or clouds in an early phase of the transition from diffuse to dense gas , with low densities and mild - uv fields .",
    "this is consistent with the high gas kinetic temperature , ( @xmath87  k ) , and relatively low densities ( @xmath99  @xmath58 ) obtained by @xcite , implying that the absorber at @xmath29 does not arise in a classical dark cloud .    in summary",
    ", we have used the vla and alma to obtain tight constraints on the o@xmath0   abundance ( relative to h@xmath0 ) , @xmath100 , in the @xmath11 spiral gravitational lens towards pks1830@xmath221 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath101 more stringent than the best previous constraint on the o@xmath0  abundance in an external galaxy .",
    "we argue that the low o@xmath0  abundance in the @xmath22 lens may arise due to its high neutral carbon abundance ( resulting in the efficient destruction of o@xmath0 ) , and the fact that the absorbing clouds are probably not dark clouds , but instead diffuse or translucent clouds , with relatively low number density and high gas kinetic temperature .",
