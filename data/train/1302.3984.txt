    "in 1980s , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated theoretically that a planetary satellite of non - spherical shape in an elliptic orbit can rotate in a chaotic , unpredictable way .",
    "they found that the most probable candidate for the chaotic rotation , due to pronounced shape asymmetry and significant orbital eccentricity , was the satellite of saturn hyperion  ( s7 ) .",
    "later on , a direct modelling of observed light curves of hyperion  @xcite confirmed the chaotic character of its rotation .",
    "recently it was found in a theoretical research  @xcite , that two other satellites of saturn , prometheus  ( s16 ) and pandora  ( s17 ) , can also reside in a state of chaotic rotation .",
    "contrary to the case of hyperion , chaos in rotation of these two satellites is due to fine - tuning of the dynamical and physical parameters rather than simply to a large extent of a chaotic zone in the rotational phase space .",
    "it is remarkable that the orbital dynamics of prometheus and pandora are known to be chaotic with the lyapunov time of only three years , and this dynamical chaos is directly observed ; see  @xcite .",
    "however note that the theoretical inferences on chaos in rotation of these satellites are completely independent from the existence of orbital chaos .    in the present paper",
    "we study the problem of rotational dynamics of these two satellites in detail , exploring the attitude stability not only in the centers of synchronous resonances , but also in the phase space in the vicinities of the resonances .",
    "our analysis includes period - doubling bifurcation modes of synchronous spin - orbit states .",
    "we take into account all available modern observational data .    an important problem , first of all from the observational point of view , is the following : whether there exists a preferred orientation of the satellites rotating chaotically , or all orientations are equiprobable ?",
    "the orientation of a satellite in chaotic rotation , generally speaking , is not necessarily isotropic .",
    "this was demonstrated in a numerical experiment by  @xcite in calculating the rotation of phobos in the vicinities of the separatrices of the 1:2 spin - orbit resonance ; see fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the present work is as follows .",
    "first , we study the attitude stability of the planar rotation of prometheus and pandora with respect to tilting the axis of rotation .",
    "the stability analysis is carried out for all possible exact modes of synchronous resonance ( @xmath0-resonance , @xmath1-resonance , and the period - doubling bifurcation mode of @xmath0-resonance ) , as well as for the trajectories of all possible kinds ( periodic , quasiperiodic , chaotic in the planar problem ) on a representative section of the phase space of planar rotation .",
    "then the problem on the preferred orientation of prometheus and pandora in chaotic rotation is considered .",
    "we suppose that a satellite represents a non - spherical rigid body moving around a planet ( a gravitating point ) in a non - perturbed elliptic orbit with the eccentricity @xmath2 .",
    "location of the satellite in the orbit is determined by the true anomaly @xmath3 or the eccentric anomaly @xmath4 .",
    "the shape of the satellite is described by a triaxial ellipsoid with the principal semiaxes @xmath5 and the corresponding principal central moments of inertia @xmath6 .",
    "the size of the satellite is much less than the radius of the orbital motion .",
    "the dynamics of the three - dimensional rotation of the satellite is determined by the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the initial conditions of the motion .",
    "the angular velocities of rotation are expressed in the units of the orbital mean motion , and the `` satellite   planet '' distance is expressed in the units of the semimajor axis of the orbit .",
    "one orbital period corresponds to @xmath9 time units .",
    "the oblateness of saturn causes precession of the pericenters of the orbits of the satellites , the precession rate being equal to @xmath10 @xmath11 in the case of prometheus and @xmath12 @xmath11 in the case of pandora @xcite .",
    "hence the periods of precession are equal to 0.36 and 0.38 yr , respectively .",
    "this is much greater that the lyapunov times ( less than 1 d ; see @xcite ) of the rotation of these satellites , if it were chaotic .",
    "since the timescales are so different , we ignore the precession of orbits in our study .    for describing the orientation of the satellite we use an inertial frame identical to that used in  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath13 frame is defined initially at the pericenter of the orbit as follows : the @xmath14 axis is directed along the `` orbit pericenter   planet '' vector , the @xmath15 axis is parallel to the vector of the orbital velocity at the pericenter , the @xmath16 axis is orthogonal to the orbital plane and completes the reference system to a right - handed system .",
    "orientation of the satellite with respect to the axes of the @xmath13 frame is defined by a sequence of imaginary rotations of the satellite by the euler angles @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 from an initial position until the satellite reaches its actual orientation . in the initial position",
    "the axes @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 coincide with the axes @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the axes @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are directed along the principal axes of inertia with the moments @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , respectively , and are `` frozen '' in the satellite .",
    "the imaginary rotations are carried out in the following sequence : first , rotation by @xmath17 about @xmath22 , second , rotation by @xmath18 about @xmath20 , and third , rotation by @xmath19 about @xmath21 .    the definition of the euler angles adopted here is identical to that described and used by @xcite and is different from the usual one .",
    "the reason for using the alternative euler angle set is that the standard one has a coordinate singularity at the point where a satellite s @xmath22 axis ( the axis of the maximum moment of inertia ) is orthogonal to the orbit plane . in the adopted frame",
    "this position corresponds to @xmath26 , while the singularity is shifted to @xmath27 .",
    "the latter value corresponds to the satellite s axis of rotation lying in the orbit plane .",
    "rotation of the satellite is described by euler s dynamic and kinematic equations .",
    "the dynamic equations  @xcite can be written as    @xmath28    here @xmath29 is the gravitational constant ; @xmath30 is the mass of the planet ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the projections of the vector of the angular velocity @xmath34 on the axes @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ; @xmath35 is the `` satellite   planet '' distance , @xmath20 is the semimajor axis of the orbit ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath36 are the direction cosines of the principal axes of inertia with respect to the direction to the planet .",
    "the kinematic equations and expressions for direction cosines , in the reference frame used here , according to  @xcite , are given by    @xmath37    @xmath38    eqs .",
    "( [ eyleq ] ) , ( [ angvel_1 ] ) , and ( [ dircos_1 ] ) are used in what follows for calculation of the rotational dynamics .",
    "in  @xcite it was found for amalthea  ( j5 ) that two different synchronous regimes of rotation , `` @xmath0-resonance '' and `` @xmath1-resonance '' , coexist in the phase space of rotation of this satellite . by means of calculation of the lyapunov characteristic exponents ( lces ) , @xcite showed that the planar rotation of amalthea in the @xmath1-resonance center and its neighbourhood was stable with respect to tilting the axis of rotation , while its rotation in the @xmath0-resonance center and its neighbourhood was unstable .",
    "( note that the terms `` @xmath0-resonance '' and `` @xmath1-resonance '' had not yet been used in that paper . ) in  @xcite by means of calculation and statistical analysis of the multipliers of the periodic solutions corresponding to the @xmath0- and @xmath1-resonances , the stability of rotation of amalthea at the centers of the both modes was investigated on a grid of values of the inertial parameters .",
    "the conclusion was made that amalthea could not reside in @xmath0-resonance .",
    "let us introduce the parameter @xmath39 , which is the frequency of small - amplitude oscillations of a satellite in synchronous resonance ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it roughly characterizes the dynamical asymmetry of the satellite shape .",
    "if we accept the data of  @xcite , then @xmath40 for prometheus and @xmath41 for pandora .",
    "for two centers of synchronous resonance to coexist in the phase space of rotational motion ( the `` amalthea effect '' ) , the @xmath42 parameter must exceed unity slightly ; see figs . 1 and 2 in @xcite and also fig",
    ".  [ fig:3 ] in the present paper .",
    "note that , in addition , the orbital eccentricity must obey a certain constraint : it must not be too high",
    ". the limit on the eccentricity , which allows coexistence of the periodic solutions corresponding to @xmath0-resonance and @xmath1-resonance , is as follows : @xmath43 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "the `` amalthea effect '' takes place for prolate satellites .",
    "indeed , @xmath44 for a triaxial ellipsoid with homogeneous density ; see @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 if @xmath46",
    ". in other words , two semiaxes should be less than @xmath47 of the third one .",
    "the `` amalthea effect '' was considered and discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this effect might be abundant amongst minor planetary satellites ( the satellites with diameters less than 100 km ) moving in close - to - circular orbits .",
    "the available data on the parameters of the figures of prometheus and pandora are collected in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "note that the data on the shapes of prometheus and pandora derived by @xcite are tabulated in the reports by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "besides , the data on the adopted positions of the poles of prometheus and pandora can be found in these reports ; these data are the same in the three references .",
    "we set the orbital eccentricity equal to @xmath48 for prometheus and @xmath49 for pandora , as in @xcite . according to ( * ? ? ? * figs .  5 and 6 ) , on the timescale of 20 years",
    "the eccentricity of prometheus varies in the limits @xmath50   @xmath51 , and that of pandora in the limits @xmath52   @xmath53 ; see also @xcite .",

    "we present the graphs only for prometheus ; in the case of pandora they look very similar .",
    "the semimajor axes of the orbits of prometheus and pandora are equal to @xmath56  km and @xmath57  km , respectively @xcite ; the mean radius of saturn is equal to @xmath58  km .",
    "it follows then that the relative area of saturn s disk as seen from the satellite ( with respect to the area of the celestial hemisphere ) is @xmath59% for prometheus and @xmath60% for pandora .",
    "these values give the average relative time that the largest axes of figures of these satellites would be oriented in the direction to saturn , if orientations of the satellites during the chaotic `` tumbling '' were isotropic .",
    "for the chaotic trajectory presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we have calculated the values of the average relative time of orientation towards saturn ; they have turned out to be equal to @xmath61% for prometheus and @xmath62% for pandora for the time interval of integration of @xmath55 orbital periods , i.e. , the `` isotropic norm '' is exceeded @xmath63 and @xmath64 times , respectively . from the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig:9](a ) and ( b ) and these numerical estimates it is clear that there exists preferred orientation of the largest satellites axes in the direction to saturn , at least for the given test trajectory .",
    "more extensive additional test computations show that for the used time interval of integration of @xmath55 orbital periods the values of the average relative time of orientation towards saturn depend on the choice of initial data .",
    "the obtained values are in the range of 2030% .",
    "the deviations may indicate that the observed anisotropy is a temporary effect due to specific initial conditions , and long term diffusion leads to its disappearance .",
    "this remains an open problem .",
    "we have studied possible rotation states of two small moons of saturn , prometheus and pandora .",
    "there are two different regimes of synchronous rotation in the phase space of planar rotational motion of prometheus : @xmath0-resonance and @xmath1-resonance , i.e. , it is subject to the `` amalthea effect '' .",
    "pandora has @xmath0-resonance only .",
    "our analysis of stability of planar rotation of these satellites with respect to tilting the axis of rotation has shown that @xmath0-resonance for prometheus is unstable or close to instability , i.e. , the satellite most probably can not reside in the given regime of synchronous rotation .",
    "rotation of prometheus in @xmath1-resonance , as well as rotation of pandora in its only possible @xmath0-resonance , is close to the attitude instability .",
    "both satellites also possess period - doubling bifurcation mode of @xmath0-resonance in the phase space of rotation .",
    "rotation of both prometheus and pandora in this mode is attitude unstable . with respect to multiplicity of synchronous states in the phase space ,",
    "prometheus is unique amongst the satellites with known inertial and orbital parameters .",
    "so , whether it is in chaotic rotation or not , its potential rotational dynamics are rich and complicated . to a less extent",
    "the same is true for pandora .",
    "our analysis of the attitude stability of planar rotation of prometheus and pandora for trajectories of various sort ( periodic , quasiperiodic , chaotic ) on a representative set of initial data , carried out by means of computation of the lyapunov spectra , has shown presence of alternating concentric ring - like zones of stable and unstable trajectories around the major synchronous states for both satellites . hypothetically",
    ", the belts of attitude instability might form `` barriers '' for capturing the satellites in synchronous rotation .",
    "in a numerical experiment we have demonstrated that the satellites in chaotic rotation can mimic ordinary regular synchronous behaviour : they can have preferred orientation for long periods of time , the largest axis of satellite s figure being directed approximately towards the planet .",
    "the presence of such anisotropy of orientation of the satellites in chaotic rotation might prevent clearing up the character of rotation in observations . whether this anisotropy is a temporary effect due to specific initial conditions , with long term diffusion leading to its disappearance , remains an open problem .",
