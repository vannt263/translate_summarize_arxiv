    "the meson light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) relates to the matrix elements of the nonlocal light - ray operators sandwiched between the hadronic state and the vacuum .",
    "it provides underlying links between the hadronic phenomena at the small and large distances . the leading - twist ( twist-2 )",
    "lcda arouses people s great interests due to its role in hard exclusive processes  @xcite , i.e. it always provides dominant contributions to those processes .",
    "the investigation on the lcdas has been the subject of numerous studies , especially for the simpler lcdas of the pseudoscalar mesons pion , kaon and etc . as for the vector @xmath0 meson , its lcdas",
    "are much more involved due to its complex structures : there are chiral - even or chiral - odd lcdas for the @xmath0 meson , the @xmath0 meson has longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) and transverse ( @xmath11 ) polarization states .",
    "several approaches have been adopted to study the @xmath0-meson lcda properties , such as the qcd sum rules  @xcite , the light - cone quark model  @xcite , the ads / qcd model  @xcite and etc .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0-meson lcda are also helpful for us to understand other vector mesons lcdas .",
    "that is , by taking the @xmath12-breaking effect into consideration , one can further study the @xmath13 meson lcdas  @xcite .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we take two types of semi - leptonic decays as a try to determine the ckm matrix element @xmath8 . one is the @xmath15-type via the process @xmath16 with branching ratio and lifetime @xmath17 and @xmath18ps  @xcite .",
    "another is the @xmath19-type via the process @xmath20 with branching ratio and lifetime @xmath21 and @xmath22ps  @xcite .",
    "our predicted weighted averages of @xmath8 are given in table [ gammatota3 ] , the babar predictions are also included as a comparison .",
    "the errors come from the choices of the @xmath23-quark mass , the borel window and the threshold parameter @xmath24 , the experimental uncertainties are from the measured lifetimes and decay ratios .",

    "the babar predictions are based on the lcsr  @xcite or isgw  @xcite predictions on @xmath3 tffs , respectively .",

    "we have discussed its properties via the @xmath3 tffs by using the lcsr approach .",
    "those chiral lcsrs for the tffs shall be dominated ( over @xmath29 ) by @xmath1 either directly or indirectly , then those tffs do provide us a platform to test the properties of the leading - twist @xmath1 . after extrapolating the tffs to their allowable region ,",
    "we compare them to those of lattice qcd predictions .",
    "those tffs become smaller with the increment of @xmath2 , and either a too smaller or a too larger @xmath2 is not allowed by the lattice qcd estimations .",
    "if we have a precise lattice qcd estimation , we can get a more strong constraint on the @xmath0-meson da behavior . in comparison to the babar prediction on the differential decay width @xmath30  @xcite and also the tffs from lattice",
    "qcd , we find that smaller @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) is not suitable . as a further comparison with the babar prediction on the @xmath8",

    "thus , we can predict that @xmath26 prefers a doubly - humped behavior other than the sing - peaked behavior of the transverse leading - twist lcda @xmath33 as suggested by ref.@xcite .    as a final remark",
    ", the present approach can also be applied to study other vector meson lcdas .",
    "for example , by taking the @xmath12-breaking effect into consideration , one can further study the @xmath13 meson lcdas .",
