    "cosmic inflation  @xcite persists as the undisputed mechanism explaining the origin of primordial curvature perturbations  @xcite necessary to account for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  @xcite and the large scale structure of our universe  @xcite .",
    "the fact that inflation is formulated within a field theoretical framework  @xcite makes it particularly compelling to test our ideas about fundamental theories , such as supergravity and string theory , characterized for consistently incorporating the gravitational strength among their couplings . because these theories generically predict the existence of a large number of degrees of freedom , the need of a period of inflation at early times is found to impose strong restrictions on their interactions . in particular ,",
    "if inflation happened at sufficiently high energies , curvature perturbations could have strongly interacted with other degrees of freedom , implying a variety of observable effects departing from those predicted in standard single - field slow - roll inflation  @xcite , including features in the power spectrum of primordial inhomogeneities  @xcite , large primordial non - gaussianities  @xcite and isocurvature perturbations  @xcite .",
    "a detection of any of these signatures would therefore represent an extremely significant step towards elucidating the fundamental nature of physics taking place during the very early universe .    despite of its simplicity",
    ", the construction of satisfactory models of inflation within supergravity and string theory is known to constitute a notoriously hard challenge .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v.s ) of scalar fields participating of the inflationary dynamics must evolve along flat directions of the scalar potential s landscape for a sufficiently long time .",
    "but because the interaction strength of these theories is of a gravitational nature , the scalar potential is naturally subject to changes of order @xmath2 when the scalar fields v.e.v.s traverse distances of the order of the planck scale .",
    "this translates into the well known @xmath3-problem of supergravity and string theory  @xcite , where second derivatives of the scalar potential @xmath4 are typically of order equal or larger than @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the universe s expansion rate ) therefore impeding the slow - roll evolution of the fields .",
    "however , this problem may be cured if the theory contains a set of shift symmetries at non - perturbative level , ensuring the existence of exactly flat directions in the potential  @xcite .",
    "then , if these symmetries are mildly broken , the expected result is an inflationary scenario with a large mass hierarchy between the modular fields representing flat directions and the rest of the scalar fields , expected to have masses much larger than @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom dictates that uv - degrees of freedom with masses @xmath7 necessarily have a marginal role in the low energy dynamics of curvature modes . after these heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out , one expects a low energy effective field theory ( eft ) for curvature perturbations where uv - physics is parametrized by nontrivial operators suppressed by factors of order @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting low energy eft is therefore expected to offer negligible departures from a truncated version of the same theory , wherein heavy fields are simply disregarded from the very beginning . however , general field theoretical arguments due allow for large sizable corrections to the low energy eft  @xcite . in the specific case of multi field models",
    ", there are special circumstances where the background inflationary dynamic is such that the interchange of kinetic energy between curvature perturbations and heavy degrees of freedom may be dramatically enhanced  @xcite .",
    "for example , if the inflationary trajectory is subject to a sharp turn in such a way that the heavy scalar fields stay normal to the trajectory ( see figure  [ turn - prototype ] for an illustration ) then unsuppressed interactions kinematically coupling curvature perturbations with heavy fields are unavoidably turned on . as a consequence , if the rate of turn is large compared to the rate of expansion @xmath6 , the impact of heavy physics on the low energy dynamics becomes substantially amplified , introducing large non - trivial departures from a naively truncated version of the theory .",
    "and @xmath9 ) with a mass hierarchy in which the flat direction is subject to a turn . ]    in the particular case of two field models at linear order in the fluctuations heavy fields are identified with isocurvature perturbations , and their role is reduced to modify the speed of sound @xmath10 of curvature perturbations at the effective field theory level . the result is a non - trivial effective single - field theory where the time dependence of @xmath10 is dictated by the specific shape of the two - field background trajectory , in such a way that departures from unity @xmath11 exist whenever the trajectory is subject to a turn .",
    "more specifically , one finds that the speed of sound depends on the angular velocity @xmath12 characterizing the turn as c_s^-2 = 1 + 4 ^2 / m_eff^2 , where @xmath13 is the effective mass of isocurvature perturbations , with @xmath14 the tree - level bare mass of heavy modes , and @xmath15 the ricci scalar of the scalar field target space . in this way",
    ", sudden turns of the trajectory translate into sudden time variations of @xmath10 ( hence modifying the value of the sound horizon @xmath16 ) and therefore generating features in the power spectrum of primordial inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the turn is such that @xmath17 , cubic interactions become unsuppressed  @xcite , implying large levels of primordial non - gaussianities in the distribution of curvature perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study two - field models of inflation characterized by a large mass hierarchy .",
    "we are particularly interested in assessing the general conditions under which the eft deduced by integrating out the heavy field remains a reliable description of the inflationary dynamics .",
    "we show that the main condition simply consists on the requirement that the rate of variation of the angular velocity @xmath12 characterizing the turn stays suppressed with respect to the effective mass @xmath18 of heavy modes .",
    "that is : | | m_eff .",
    "[ intro : adiabatic - cond ] we show that this _ adiabaticity _ condition is sufficiently mild , as it still allows for the effective field theory to describe , with great accuracy , a large variety of situations where very sharp turns take place ( _ i.e. _ situations where @xmath19 ) .",
    "we check this condition by studying various models with turns and compare the power spectra of these models obtained from both , the full two - field inflationary model and the respective effective field theory .",
    "we find that turns are able to generate large features in the power spectra , with the amplitude of these features depending on how large departures of @xmath10 from unity are .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : review ] we provide a self contained review on two - field models of inflation and summarize the main known results concerning the existence of mass hierarchies .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : effective - theory ] we offer a simple derivation of the general class of single - field eft emerging from two - field models with mass hierarchies , and derive condition ( [ intro : adiabatic - cond ] ) dictating the validity of this theory in terms of background quantities . in section  [ sec : sudden - turns ] we discuss the different classes of turns and deduce the type of reactions that turns have on the background inflationary trajectory",
    ". in particular , we study the case of sudden turns , where the inflationary trajectory is subject to a single turn for a brief period of time @xmath20 smaller ( or much smaller ) than an @xmath21-fold @xmath22 .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : examples ] , we consider two toy models and compute the power spectrum for different cases of turns .",
    "there we show that , consistent with ( [ intro : adiabatic - cond ] ) , the effective field theory remains reliable as long as @xmath23 , where @xmath18 is the effective mass of the heavy field .",
    "we also show that large features on the power spectrum are easily produced , with the details of the effects depending on the different parameters characterizing the type of turns .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we offer our concluding remarks to this work .",

    "for instance , in ref .  @xcite it is claimed that the effective field theory  ( [ total - action - r - effective ] ) is only valid in the regime where turns are such that @xmath280 .. ] the main argument made there is that the ratio @xmath162 corresponds to the coupling determining the kinetic energy transfer between the light curvature mode with the heavy fields .",
    "a large value of @xmath74 would therefore imply large transfer of energy from curvature perturbations to the heavy mode , exciting the heavy modes and rendering the effective field theory invalid .",
    "however , as we have seen , this energy interchange between both modes may happen adiabatically without implying a breakdown of the effective field theory .",
    "indeed , the heavy mode is receiving energy from the light degree of freedom at the same rate than it is giving it back , and therefore it is possible to have turns whereby the heavy - mode s high - frequency fluctuations stay suppressed ( recall our discussion of section  [ sec : effective - theory ] ) .",
    "one key point here is that even for large values of @xmath162 the heavy modes will not become easily excited unless they receive a sufficiently strong kick .",
    "for example , even if the turn is such that | | h , the trajectory is necessarily subject to a large angular acceleration @xmath281 , momentarily violating slow - roll  @xcite but without exciting heavy modes .",
    "moreover , as we have seen , if these accelerations are brief ( as in our examples ) slow - roll is only interrupted for a short period of time , and the system quickly goes back to the slow - roll attractor state ( within an @xmath21-fold ) . during these transients , @xmath73 were typically found to have sizable variations in response to the turns , whereas @xmath70 was found to stay close to its suppressed value .",
    "the net effect of this process are oscillatory features in the power spectrum , with the frequency of the oscillation depending on how brief was the overall turn . while current observational constraints on features are still poor  @xcite , future data will certainly put strong constraints on primordial features , therefore improving our understanding of the role of uv - physics on the very early universe .    another important point of departure from previous works regards the procedure employed to integrate heavy fields . in the present work we have integrated out high energy fluctuations ( heavy degrees of freedom ) about the exact time - dependent background trajectory , offered by the homogeneous equations of motion of the system .",
    "this contrasts with other schemes  @xcite where heavy fields are taken care of at the action level , regardless of the background dynamics , by imposing that they locally minimize the inflationary potential ( with the minima depending on the inflaton v.e.v . ) . in our present language",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath282 , implying that there are no turns at all ( and therefore missing all of the interesting features we have studied so far ) .",
    "although such a case corresponds to a genuine limit shared by a large family of multi - field potentials with mass hierarchies  @xcite , it misses the more general situation in which the inflationary trajectory meanders away from the locus of minima offered by the potential .",
    "we should emphasize that our results are strictly valid only at linear order in the fluctuations .",
    "for a complete analysis one should examine the relevance of higher order interaction terms which could introduce important corrections when the speed of sound is suppressed ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is similar to the case of dbi inflation  @xcite where a suppressed speed of sound makes the perturbation theory to enter the strong - coupling regime  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the full structure of effective field theories arising from two - field models with large mass hierarchies is studied , and other relevant constraints involving higher order terms are analyzed .",
