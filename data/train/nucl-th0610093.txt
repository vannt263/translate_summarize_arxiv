    "it is well recognized that the precise knowledge of neutrino - nucleus reaction cross sections is of importance in analyzing neutrino oscillation experiments ; for recent reports , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , neutrino - nucleus reactions at incident neutrino energies around 1  gev play a prominent role in many cases including the experiments at k2k  @xcite . to obtain estimates of the relevant cross sections , one must at present rely on theory , and much theoretical effort has been invested to provide these estimates  @xcite . in an attempt to make a quantitative estimation of neutrino - nucleus reaction cross sections ,",
    "it is useful to study simultaneously the related electron - nucleus reactions within the same general theoretical framework , and this strategy has been pursued by many authors . in electron - nucleus scattering in the gev region , quasi - elastic scattering and pion - production processes are known to be the main reaction mechanisms , and similar features are expected to manifest themselves also in the neutrino - nucleus reactions in the gev region .    for quasi - elastic scattering , the relevant transition operators",
    "are essentially known , so the main theoretical issue is how to incorporate various nuclear effects for the initial and final states .",
    "the early works were based on the fermi gas model  @xcite , but recent investigations incorporate the nuclear correlation effects in the initial state with the use of the spectral function and take account of the final - state interactions on the outgoing nucleon  @xcite . as regards the pion - production process , in addition to these nuclear effects , the structure of the transition operators responsible for pion production needs to be carefully studied .",
    "these operators can in principle involve more than one nucleon , but it is in general expected that pion production on a single nucleon should give a dominant contribution .",
    "neutrino - induced pion production on the nucleon in the resonance region has been studied so far mostly with the use of pure resonance excitation amplitudes . in some studies",
    "these amplitudes were evaluated in the quark model , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . in recent studies by paschos and his collaborators  @xcite ,",
    "the resonance excitation amplitudes due to the vector current were directly related to the empirically known electro - excitation amplitudes , while those due to the axial - vector current were constrained by invoking pcac .    meanwhile , it is to be noted that pion production can take place not only through resonance excitations but also via non - resonant processes .",
    "two of the present authors  @xcite have recently developed a dynamical model for describing photo- and electro - production of pions off the nucleon around the @xmath0-resonance region , with the view to systematically incorporating both the resonance and non - resonance contributions .",
    "hereafter we refer to this approach as the sl - model ( the sato - lee model ) .",
    "the development of the sl - model was motivated by recent extensive experimental studies of electron- and photon - induced meson - production reactions on the nucleon in the resonance region .",
    "the main objective of these experiments is to study the non - perturbative features of qcd by testing the resonance properties as predicted by qcd - inspired models and/or lattice simulations .",
    "the sl - model was subsequently extended to weak - interaction processes  @xcite , and it was shown that this model gives a successful description of neutrino - induced pion production in the @xmath0-resonance region .    as explained in more detail later , the sl - model starts from the non - resonant meson - baryon interaction and the resonance interaction , and the unitary amplitudes are obtained from the scattering equation .",
    "it leads to fairly consistent descriptions of all the available data for the electroweak reactions in the @xmath0-resonance region .",
    "it has been shown that treating the resonance and non - resonance amplitudes on the same footing can have significant observable consequences .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of the pion cloud effects as considered in sl can resolve a long - standing puzzle that the @xmath1-@xmath0 magnetic dipole transition form factor @xmath2 predicted by the quark model is smaller than the empirical value by as much as @xmath340% .",
    "furthermore , the electric e2(@xmath4 ) and coulomb c2(@xmath5 ) form factors for the @xmath1-@xmath0 transition in electron scattering calculated in the sl - model show pronounced momentum dependences due to the pion cloud effects , which suggests non - negligible deformation effects in the @xmath1-@xmath0 transition .",
    "regarding the neutrino reactions , a serious problem that has been known for quite some time is that the axial - vector @xmath1-@xmath0 transition strength calculated in the constituent quark model  @xcite is lower than the empirical value  @xcite by about 35 % .",
    "it is noteworthy that the dynamical pion cloud effects included in the sl - model  @xcite can naturally remove this discrepancy .    in view of these successes , it seems worthwhile to study neutrino - nucleus reactions in the resonance region with the use of the sl - model amplitudes for neutrino - induced pion production on the nucleon .",
    "we describe here our first attempt at such a study and present the cross sections , the energy spectrum of the final lepton ( for charged - current reactions ) , and the lepton - momentum transfer distribution .",
    "our work is basically of exploratory nature and , as far as the nuclear effects are concerned , we only consider those that can be taken into account with the use of a modified fermi gas model wherein nuclear correlations are approximately subsumed into the spectral function  @xcite . despite these limitations ,",
    "our investigation is hoped to be informative as the first calculation of neutrino - nucleus reactions in the @xmath0-resonance region based on the electroweak pion - production amplitudes calculated in sl  @xcite , whose validity has been extensively tested by the jlab data  @xcite .",
    "it is understood that , as the experimental precision improves , more detailed calculations will be called for that incorporate higher order effects . in particular , the final - state interaction ( fsi ) must be treated properly . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and many earlier works on inclusive electron scattering , fsi re - distributes the inclusive cross sections and , for the incident electron energy around 1 gev , fsi can reduce the strength at the quasi - free peak by about 10 @xmath6 .",
    "we remark that a detailed study  @xcite indicates that the fsi effects for inclusive reactions , properly treated , can be rather different from those for exclusive processes  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in the pion production region , we need to take into account pion absorption and medium effects on @xmath0 propagation . to this end",
    ", one may profitably use the information obtained in the well - developed @xmath0-hole model  @xcite ; such a study has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite within the framework of the dynamical transport approach .",
    "our present calculation , however , falls short of considering fsi .",
    "since the importance of these fsi effects grows rather fast with the increasing target mass number ( this is particularly true for pion absorption ) , we limit ourselves here to nuclear targets of low mass numbers and concentrate on the a=12 target .",
    "although heavier nuclei such as @xmath7 are important in some neutrino - oscillation experiments  @xcite , we can deal with these cases only after fsi is incorporated into our formalism .",
    "as the sl - model has been fully described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we give here only a brief explanation of the model , using as an example the case of pion photoproduction . the effective hamiltonian @xmath8 in the sl - model for this process is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the free hamiltonian ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the non - resonant pion - nucleon and pion photoproduction interactions , respectively , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are responsible for the creation and annihilation of a bare @xmath0-resonance . by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation based on the above effective hamiltonian , we obtain the amplitude for pion production on a nucleon as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total energy of the pion and nucleon in the center - of - mass system . the first term @xmath17 is the non - resonant amplitude , which arises from the vertices @xmath11 and @xmath18 alone , while the second term represents the resonant amplitude involving the dressed vertex @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the bare resonance vertex @xmath20 is renormalized into @xmath19 by the non - resonant meson cloud effects arising from rescattering as @xmath21 and that the renormalized resonance vertex @xmath19 should exhibit a significant deviation from the bare vertex @xmath20 because of the meson cloud effects . in conventional analyses , however , one disregards the difference between the bare and renormalized resonance vertices and , assuming the breit - wigner form for ( what in our approach is identified as ) the renormalized vertex , tries to extract the parameters characterizing that form by fitting to the data .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and as briefly mentioned in the introduction , the resonance properties deduced from this simplified treatment tend to exhibit significant discrepancies with the theoretical predictions , indicating the importance of considering the resonant and non - resonant contributions simultaneously .",
    "we expect that the unified treatment of the resonant and non - resonant contributions should have significant consequences in the neutrino - nucleon and neutrino - nucleus reactions as well . to illustrate this point , we give in fig .",
    "[ fig - h ] the electron energy spectrum @xmath22 for the @xmath23 reaction calculated in the sl - model .",
    "since the isospin of the @xmath24 system for the @xmath25 reaction is @xmath26 , one may naively expect that the @xmath0-resonance amplitude dominates the cross section .",
    "however , the energy spectra obtained in our sl - model calculation ( shown in the solid lines ) are markedly different from those obtained from the dressed resonant amplitudes ( shown in the long - dash lines ) . for comparison ,",
    "the results obtained in the lalakulich - paschos ( lp ) model  @xcite are also shown in the short dashed lines .",
    "if in our approach we drop the contribution of the non - resonant amplitudes ( retaining only the resonance contributions ) , the results turn out to be very similar to those obtained in the lp - model .",

    "the matrix element of the nucleon current for pion production , @xmath68 , is calculated using the sl model . since sl gives the pion - production amplitude in the pion - nucleon center - of - mass frame ( @xmath24-cm frame , for short ) , we transform it into the amplitude in the rest frame of the target nucleus ( lab frame ) according to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the invariant mass of the pion and nucleon given by @xmath71 .",

    "we note that the pauli blocking factor , @xmath76 , is dependent on the pion momentum @xmath77 through @xmath78 , and hence the consideration of the pauli blocking effect requires the knowledge of the pion - production amplitude .",
    "we come back to this point later .",
    "we take into account the nuclear correlation effects in the initial state by using the spectral function @xmath79 obtained in ref .",
    "this is achieved by the following replacements in eq .",
    "( [ wmunu ] ) @xmath80 we note that @xmath79 is normalized as @xmath81 .",
    "although the use of the spectral function implies that the separation of occupied and empty nucleon orbits based on the fermi momentum @xmath63 is no longer strictly valid , we choose to retain the factor @xmath76 in eq.([wmunu ] ) to approximately take account of pauli blocking for the final nucleon .",
    "using the formalism explained in the previous section , we calculate neutrino - nucleus reaction cross sections for a representative case of the @xmath82-@xmath83c scattering . for the incident neutrino energy",
    "we take @xmath84 gev , a value lying in the energy region of current importance for many neutrino oscillation experiments .",
