    "ss433 is an eclipsing binary star which ejects antiparallel jets at a near relativistic velocity of 0.26c ( e.g. vermeulen @xcite ) .",
    "the kinematics is revealed by optical doppler - shifted lines ( e.g. margon & anderson ) , as well as radio maps e.g. the corkscrew - shaped trails due to precession ( hjellming & johnston ) .",
    "the jets show complicated precessing and nodding motions , they are collimated to better than 4@xmath0 . the velocity of ejection is constant to within a few percent .",
    "radio flux monitoring programmes showed that has active and quiescent periods ( e.g. fiedler et al .",
    "@xcite ) . knots in the jets moving at 0.26c can be seen on merlin scales ( e.g. spencer @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "radio structure on a scale of 10 to 50  mas was discovered in 1979 ( schilizzi et al .",
    "since then , many vlbi observations have been made with a variety of arrays and observing frequencies which revealed that moving components are present in both the active and quiescent periods of ss433 ( e.g. romney et al .",
    "@xcite ; fejes et al .",
    "@xcite ; vermeulen et al .",
    "these observations also showed that the central part of the radio source has a core - wing morphology which is not centre - brightened .",
    "the presence of a brightening zone  where the moving components become brighter  at 50  milliarcsecond from the centre was discovered by vermeulen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we present vlbi observations of at 1.6 , 5 and 15  ghz .",
    "these observations provide us with the highest resolution spectral index maps ever made for this object .",
    "in addition to the usual vlbi structure , our maps show several new features in the system . in sect .  2 .",
    "we describe the observations and the data reduction process . in sect .",
    "the vlbi images and some related observational results are presented .",
    "we discuss our results in sect .",
    "the observations took place on 6 may 1995 with the vlba and a single element of the vla at 1.6 , 5 and 15  ghz . at this time",
    "the binary orbital phase was 0.28 ( where @xmath1  =  0 corresponds to the eclipse of the accretion disk by the normal star ) while the precession phase ( following the definition of vermeulen @xcite ) of the radio jets was 0.5 , when the approaching jet lies closest to the line of sight .",
    "was observed during 10 hours using left circular polarization and 16  mhz bandwidth .",
    "the experiment included some phase - referencing scans with the background radio sources ( at all frequencies ) and ( 5  ghz only ) .",
    "frequencies were cycled between 1.6 , 5 and 15  ghz every 6.5 minutes except during the phase reference scans .",
    "initial data calibration was done using the nrao aips package ( cotton @xcite ; diamond @xcite ) .",
    "we used measured antenna system temperatures for amplitude calibration . there was a need to fringe - fit for the delay and fringe rate for the outer antennas of the vlba separately due to low signal - to - noise ratios on the longest baselines . even with this method , solutions failed for the antennas mk and sc .",
    "we made a preliminary image using the rest of the array .",
    "after dividing the source model visibilities into the dataset we repeated the fringe - fitting as described above , and were able to obtain solutions for all antennas except sc at 15  ghz .",
    "the complex bandpasses were calibrated using our fringe - finder sources and .",
    "after bandpass calibration , the data were averaged in frequency in each if and then in time ( one minute integration time ) .",
    "editing , self - calibration and imaging was carried out using difmap ( shepherd et al .",
    "we present the naturally weighted images of at 1.6  ghz ( fig .",
    "[ 18 cm ] . ) , 5  ghz , and 15  ghz ( fig .",
    "[ 6/2 cm ] . ) . at 1.6 and 5",
    "ghz there is the well - known jet structure , oriented largely east - west , which is roughly bi - symmetric in shape although not in detailed flux density .",
    "we have labelled some of the more prominent structures in accordance with our interpretation outlined below . by using a 50  mas restoring beam",
    ", we were able to trace the jets out to 500  mas from the centre at 1.6  ghz ( fig .",
    "[ 18cm_lfv ] . ) .",
    "the 1.6  ghz image in addition contains extended features in locations oriented at a large angle to the jets , where no emission has ever been seen before .",
    "we have performed extensive tests to verify that these are not artifacts of our data - reduction method .",
    "there is evidence for these same regions at 5  ghz , but they are too faint and too extended to be properly imaged from our data .",
    "the 15  ghz image is more asymmetric , but shows the same general inner jet structure : e@xmath2 and w@xmath2 are identifiable with the same separation as at the lower frequencies , and there is also emission at the location of the e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 complexes .",
    "clearly , all emission regions are extended , and the details of their morphology are difficult to image reliably at this high resolution .",
    "our resolution at 5 and 15  ghz was sufficient to detect the motion of some jet components during the 12  hours observing time .",
    "source structure changes did not affect the final images significantly  this was checked by splitting the dataset into shorter timeranges .",
    "however , time - smearing may have affected the dynamic range of our images , especially at 15  ghz .",
    "components e@xmath2 and w@xmath2 , with their well - defined constant separation of 60  mas , are the most easily recognizable features between the three frequencies , and we have used these for the relative alignment of the images . we have been able to verify this relative alignment at 5 and 15  ghz by phase - referencing . and ( an extragalactic background source located at an angular distance of 24@xmath4 )",
    "were observed alternately in short 1 min .",
    "( at 15  ghz ) and 2 min .",
    "( at 5 and 1.6  ghz ) cycles during four phase - referencing scans .",
    "we fringe - fitted using a point source model , and made an image .",
    "the resulting model visibilities were divided into the dataset and we repeated fringe - fitting .",
    "delay , multiband - delay and fringe rate solutions  corrected for structural effects of the reference source  were applied to ss433 . in this way images of at different frequencies",
    "are overlaid naturally - assuming that the image centres at different frequencies are exactly at the same place in the source . in agreement with our first estimates , the 15 and 5  ghz images aligned well .",
    "unfortunately , at 1.6  ghz the reference source turned out not to have compact structure , perhaps as a result of scattering , either in the supernova remnant , or elsewhere along the line of sight through our galaxy .",
    "the `` absolute '' centre of ejection , where the binary stellar system is located , is not obvious from the radio emission at any frequency , and there is no centrally brightened `` core '' feature .",
    "for example , we find that the brightest part of e@xmath3 ( on the side closest to the centre ) , is 4  mas closer to e1 at 1.6 ghz than at 5 and 15  ghz .",
    "also , the separation between the inner parts of e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 decreases from 14  mas , to 6  mas , and then to 5  mas , in going from 1.6  ghz , to 5  ghz , and then to 15  ghz .",
    "however , we can use the well - established kinematic model of the precessing jets of ( margon & anderson ; hjellming & johnston ; vermeulen @xcite ) to find the centre .",
    "we believe that the features e@xmath2-w@xmath2 and e@xmath5-w@xmath5 are matched pairs , corresponding to successive events of ejection or knot formation which occurred simultaneously in both jets . adopting the kinematic model parameters of margon & anderson ( ) we find ages of 3.5  days and 7  days for e@xmath2-w@xmath2 and e@xmath5-w@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the greater angular extent ( i.e.  apparent component spacing ) on the eastern ( approaching ) side is in accordance with the light travel time predictions of the kinematic model . based on e@xmath2 and w@xmath2 in the 5  ghz image",
    ", we derive that the most plausible location of the centre is @xmath62.5  mas w and @xmath7 mas n of the peak of e@xmath3 at 5 ghz .",
    "while our main interest was not to improve the accuracy of the kinematic model parameters , we made a series of tests at all frequencies in which we varied the projected position angle of the precession cone axis in the plane of the sky , and independently the model precession phase ; acceptable values of these parameters are well correlated from our images .",
    "we find that the previously reported pa  =  100@xmath8 ( e.g. hjellming & johnston ) fitted the structures well .",
    "our main result is that the kinematic model centre is between e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 , in the middle of the core - complex in the 15  ghz image ( see fig .",
    "[ 6/2 cm ] . ) .      we used the relative image alignments as described in sect .  3.2 .",
    "shifting of the uv - data was performed by self - calibrating to model files brought into alignment using the caltech vlbi package ( pearson & readhead ) modfix program .",
    "spectral index maps between 1.6 - 5  ghz and 5 - 15  ghz were made in aips after convolving the higher frequency image with the lower frequency beam in both cases ( fig .",
    "[ spix ] . ) .",
    "the central region has an inverted spectrum , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 throughout this paper ) .",
    "between 1.6 and 5  ghz , the jet spectral index steepens with distance from the core , decreasing below @xmath111.0 at about 25  mas , while there are flatter regions , especially the knots at 30  mas .",
    "these knots , e@xmath2 and w@xmath2 , differ in spectral properties , @xmath12  @xmath13 for e@xmath2 , and @xmath14 for w@xmath2 .",
    "in general , the two jets have similar spectral behaviour .",
    "this is not true between 5 and 15  ghz , where the western jet steepens much faster , reaching @xmath15  @xmath16 less than 10  mas from the core . in the 5 - 15 ghz image",
    "we clearly resolve the core gap .",
    "the eastern part consists of a large , inverted area ( @xmath15  @xmath17 ) , while to the west only a thin inverted edge can be seen ( @xmath18  @xmath6  0.5 ) .",
    "we performed modelfitting in difmap .",
    "we divided the 5  ghz dataset into three parts in order to fit the positions of the source components during the observation .",
    "the motion of e@xmath2 and w@xmath2 was detected , in agreement with the kinematic model .",
    "our modelfitting results , however , are not accurate enough to investigate the proper motion of these components in detail , because the time interval is too short",
    ". we did not detect unambiguous motion in the inner jets .",
    "note that there are no well separated components in the inner part of the jets , which makes the modelfitting process difficult .",
    "as the source structure can not be described with a single set of model components at all three frequencies , flux densities of the components were determined from the images in aips .",
    "we defined eight areas on the images ( around e@xmath3 , w@xmath3 ,  ) in which flux densities were summed up .",

    "( @xcite ) that the core area is not centre - brightened . for the first time , we have the resolution to see a gap between the core - wings ( fig .",
    "[ 18 cm ] . and [ 6/2 cm ] . ) .",
    "kinematic modelling  based on the jet curvature and symmetry of outer components",
    " showed that the kinematic centre of the source is in the middle of the gap in the 15  ghz image .",
    "the separation of the brightest parts of e@xmath23 and w@xmath3 increases with decreasing frequency as a result of synchrotron self - absorption , in rough accordance with various different jet models , described below .",
    "however , the spectral properties are quite dissimilar between e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 .",
    "it is obvious that their flux density ratio at any arbitrary frequency does not simply reflect the effect of differential doppler - boosting as was thought to be the case by fejes ( @xcite ) and vermeulen ( @xcite ) .",
    "we argue below that the different spectra are caused by free - free absorption in a medium which envelopes the various parts of the jets to different depths .    in the standard extragalactic jet model",
    "the distance of the self - absorbed radio core from the central engine is proportional to @xmath24 ( blandford & knigl ) ; this leads to a predictable radio core position shift between frequencies . in the case of continuous jets ( steady emission pattern )",
    "the arm - length ratio between the approaching and the receding jet is always unity , and the central engine is simply located mid - way between the radio `` cores '' in the two jets .",
    "following the formalism of lobanov ( @xcite ) , the measure of core position shift can be calculated by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the observed core position shift between observing frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( given in hz ) , @xmath29 is the distance to the source in parsecs .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is model dependent , and was assumed to be unity .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field in the jet at 1  pc from the central engine can be written ( lobanov @xcite ) : @xmath31^{1/4}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the jet doppler factor , @xmath1 is the jet opening angle and @xmath33 is the jet viewing angle . using @xmath34 with @xmath35 , substituting @xmath36 for the jet opening angle , and calculating the parameters dependent on orientation ( @xmath33 and @xmath37 for precession phase 0.5 , we find that the observed @xmath64  mas core position shift in the approaching jet side between 1.6 and 5  ghz results in an equipartition magnetic field strength @xmath38 gauss at 35  au from the central engine , where the 1.6  ghz core component is observed .",
    "as the separation of e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 between 1.6 and 5 ghz is proportional to @xmath24 , and we obtained a reasonable field strength in our calculations , we conclude that the core - wings at 1.6  ghz are mainly self - absorbed .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with the fact that the integrated flux density of e@xmath3 is nearly constant ( table  [ modelfit ] . ) , i.e. the overall spectral index of the region is flat , as expected in case of synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the peak brightness of the approaching jet at 15  ghz , however , does not seem to be high enough ; the spectrum of a resolved , self - absorbed component would be more inverted .",
    "moreover , the position shift between the 5  ghz and 15  ghz core components seems to be zero , or at least is smaller then our errors in aligning the images , which is estimated to be a few tenth of mas .",
    "we interpret the absence of core position shifts at high frequencies and the relative faintness of the high frequency near - in core components in terms of additional free - free absorption . increasing column depth of thermal electrons may results in a situation where",
    "the innermost part of e@xmath3 at 15  ghz is absorbed so that the peak brightness is shifted outward from the central engine .",
    "similarly , the brightest parts of the receding jet ( located consecutively closer to the central engine with increasing frequency ) are absorbed , and so the overall spectrum of w@xmath23 remains steep from 1.6  ghz to 15  ghz .",
    "we also compared the observed jet intensity profiles ( i.e. the jet brightness distribution as a function of distance to the central engine ) to the conical jet model of hjellming & johnston ( ) .",
    "in this model the jet is assumed to expand adiabatically and the expansion is dominated by lateral motions of the flow .",
    "we also assumed that the expansion is free , and not slowed down by the interstellar medium . in agreement with our interpretation",
    "above , we obtained good first order agreement at 1.6  ghz between the shape of the observed and model jet intensity profiles .",
    "this further supports that e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 are regions in transition from optically thick to optically thin regimes .",
    "the effect of doppler - boosting and de - boosting of the approaching and receding jet sides was also as expected . however , this is not the case at 5  ghz and 15  ghz .",
    "we scaled the model to the 1.6 ghz data , then estimated the additional free - free absorption required to explain the observed jet profiles at higher frequencies .",
    "as this is very sensitive to the alignment of the model with the data in position and the relative alignment of the jet intensity profiles between the frequencies  keeping in mind that we have a few tenth of mas uncertainty in aligning the images  , the values determined below must be considered as rough estimates .",
    "note also that these values are specific to the hjellming & johnston ( ) adiabatic jet model .",
    "the optical depths required to explain the observed peak flux densities at 5  ghz are estimated to be @xmath39 and 2 at the approaching and the receding side , respectively . as there is a difference in the optical depths on the two sides , this additional absorption can not be intrinsic to the jets .",
    "the required density of free electrons to produce @xmath39 at 5  ghz is @xmath40 @xmath41 ( assuming a thermal component with @xmath42  k , and a characteristic pathlength @xmath43=30  au through the absorbing medium ) .",
    "the relative faintness of e@xmath3 at 15  ghz and the fact that w@xmath3 is absorbed almost completely suggest that the column density increases toward the central engine .",
    "the almost completely absorbed peak of w@xmath3 component at 15  ghz requires @xmath44 @xmath41 or higher .",
    "we could not interpret our observations as the result of free - free absorption in a spherically symmetric stellar wind of the early - type star ( stirling et al .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming a spherically symmetric configuration and e.g. @xmath45 dependence of the free electron density on the distance to the binary , the differences in the integrated emission measures can not explain the observed high difference in the optical depths between the two sides .",
    "instead we suggest the possibility of a disk - like geometry for the absorbing medium ( fig .",
    "[ discabs ] ) .",
    "note that this region is much larger than the accretion disk .",
    "the projected size of the gap between e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 is 25  au , whereas the binary system is generally thought to be @xmath6  1  au in size .",
    "the spherically symmetric versus equatorially enhanced stellar wind scenarios will be studied in multi - epoch multi - frequency monitoring observations spanning various phases of the precession cycle of which allow different lines of sight to be probed .",
    "random projected velocity deviations of about 5000  km / s are frequently observed in the jets of ; these have in the past been successfully explained by deviations of only a few degrees in the pointing angle of the jets ( `` jitter '' ) .",
    "detections of anomalous radio emission components have been reported in some cases .",
    "modelfitting of 1981 single - baseline effelsberg - westerbork data ( romney et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicated an elongated structure straddling the core in pa  62 which is beyond the kinematic model cone .",
    "spencer & waggett ( ) showed anomalous radio emission 15 - 20 from the predicted locus in a 1982 series of evn 5  ghz images .",
    "jowett & spencer ( ) found a pair of knots apparently moving at only half the predicted jet velocity in a 1991 and 1992 series of 5 ghz merlin .",
    "our observation of shows two faint , extended emission regions to the ne and sw from the central engine  assumed to be located in between e@xmath3 and w@xmath3 components as explained above  extending in pa@xmath46 over a distance of 30  mas to 70  mas in the 1.6  ghz image ( fig .",
    "[ 18 cm ] . ) .",
    "they are quite distinct from the `` normal '' jets , which are obviously also present .",
    "features this far away in position angle from the jets have never been observed before .",
    "the implied brightness temperature of 10@xmath47  k suggests non - thermal radiation .",
    "should the ne and sw components be moving approximately along the plane of the sky at 0.26c ( like the jets ) , then these newly discovered features would have an age of a few days .",
    "but because this would imply an unprecedentedly large deviation from the kinematic model , because there were no noteworthy radio events in the source right before the observation ( fender et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and , most importantly , because we have seen the features again in more recent data , with similar disposition ( paragi et al . in preparation ) , we believe that ne and sw are probably not anomalous knots which can be associated with the jets , ejected at near relativistic speeds . instead , we believe these radio features are longer - lived , perhaps even permanent regions of emission extended along the equatorial plane of the binary system .",
    "we think they have not been previously detected because our vlbi array had an unprecedented sensitivity to extended , low surface brightness emission .",
    "if we associate the anomalous components with a quasi - equatorial outflow from the system with typical early - type stellar wind speeds ( in the order of 1000  km / s ) , we may observe the position angle of the flow to be correlated with the precessional phase .",
    "the possibility of such an outflow or extended disk around have been reported by several authors as summarized below .",
    "the asymmetric and variable shape of the optical lightcurve of was explained by zwitter et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as being due to the effect of an optically thick disk - like outflow of matter extending more or less radially from the `` slaved '' accretion disk which is thought to surround the compact object in .",
    "slaved accretion disk models , in which different parts are in different planes because the matter is slaved to the rotation of the companion on which it originated , have already been invoked for by several authors ( e.g. van den heuvel @xcite ) soon after its discovery .",
    "zwitter et al . (",
    "@xcite ) proposed a relatively large ( @xmath620 ) opening angle to the _ excretion flow _ , centred close to the orbital plane of the binary system .",
    "the presence of a very extended disk around ss433 ( outer radius 1 - 3 arcmin , which translates to a few parsecs at the distance of the source ) with an opening angle as large as @xmath660  based on geometrical considerations was invoked by fabrika ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of doppler shifted x - ray lines as a function of the precession phase observed by brinkmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and kotani et al . (",
    "@xcite ) also indicate the need for a slaved disk model . in their model",
    ", there is an extended rim of the accretion disk .",
    "however , the outer part of this disk must turn toward the orbital plane .",
    "so the opening angle of the extended envelope must be less than determined by fabrika ( @xcite ) .    according to numerical simulations by sawada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) a considerable fraction of the transferring gas is lost in a binary system through the l@xmath5 lagrangian point , behind the compact star .",
    "this results in an expanding envelope at pa=10  . numerical simulations",
    "applied directly to ss433 also suggested the existence of an equatorial outflow due to spiral shocks in the accretion disk ( chakrabarti & matsuda ) .",
    "this quasi - stationary spiral shock structure can also explain the subday variabilities observed in the optical part of the spectrum ( chakrabarti & matsuda ) .",
    "we interpret ne and sw as the manifestation of the excretion disk in the radio regime . during episodes of enhanced mass transfer from the companion to the compact object ,",
    "bright components emerge from the core - complex ( vermeulen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this may also lead to enhanced ejection into the excretion flow through the l@xmath5 lagrangian point , and develop shock waves into the ism .",
    "relativistic electrons can be produced in the shock fronts that are responsible for the observed non - thermal radiation .",
    "the observed position angle and the large extent of ne and sw are in agreement with the slaved disk model discussed above .",
    "we have shown that is active even in its `` low '' state .",
    "there is a continuous inner jet region , and moving pairs of blobs are present . the eastern and western part of the core - complex is separated by a gap , which is in fact the kinematic model centre .",
    "there are fainter extended regions not connected directly to the moving jets of the source .",
    "we overview the models that explain the various activities observed in the system .",
    "we find that the slaved accretion disk scenario - in general - is in agreement with our observations .",
    "however , many questions remain to be answered .",
    "the asymmetry within the core implies that the radio emission and absorption scenario is not well established in ss433 . on one hand , it is clear that there must be an intrinsic asymmetry in the free - free absorbing medium . on the other hand",
    ", we can not explain the spectral properties of the core - wings with a simple model",
    ". multifrequency monitoring of at different precessional phases will hopefully help us to separate the effect of doppler - boosting and viewing angle from intrinsic properties , and to constrain the spatial extent of the absorbing medium in the innermost part of the source .",
