    "however , less than @xmath9 of the baryons observed at @xmath8 have been detected so far @xcite . according to simulations for the formation of structures in the universe ,",
    "most of such baryons would be located , at the present epoch , in low density intergalactic gas , which has been shock - heated to temperatures of @xmath10  k ( i.e. the warm - hot intergalactic medium whim , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most efficient way to detect the presence of whim is through resonant absorption lines from highly ionized metals ( e.g. ovi , ovii , oviii , ne  ix ) imprinted in the far uv ( fuv ) and soft x - ray spectra of background sources @xcite .",
    "however , severe instrumental limitations have hampered so far the detection of conspicuous amount of whim .",
    "the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) allows the ovi doublet ( @xmath11 and @xmath12  ) to be detected only up to z@xmath13 .",
    "more importantly ovi dominates the relative abundance distribution of o in shock - heated gas in pure collisional ionization equilibrium , only at relatively low temperatures , @xmath14  k , and so it tracks just the low - temperature tail of the whim distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "soft x - rays are far more promising . the strongest resonant transitions from ovii , neix ( both helium - like ions , and therefore highly stable ) and oviii , all fall in the soft x - ray band .",
    "these ions dominate the o and ne relative abundance distributions of both collisionaly ionized gas , and mixed , photoionized and collisionaly ionized gas , over a broad range of temperatures , between @xmath15 k and @xmath16 k , where the whim distribution peaks @xcite .",
    "the major fraction of the whim should then be visible in the x - rays .",
    "however , despite the large relative abundances of `` x - ray '' ions in the whim , the current sensitivity and resolution of x - ray spectrometers has allowed so far only the strongest ( ew@xmath17 m ) of these systems to be detected , and only against spectra of very bright background sources ( nicastro et al . 2002 ; mathur , weimberg & chen 2003 ; fang et al . 2002 ; fang , weimberg & canizares 2003 ; with _ chandra _ and rasmussen , kahn & paerels 2003 with _ xmm - newton _ ; for a recent review see paerels & kahn 2003 ) .",

    "we extracted first and second order source and the background spectra , for a total of 12 spectra , but since second order spectra have a significantly lower number of photons , we will concentrate on first order only .",
    "we modeled the continuum of each rgs-1 and rgs-2 observation of in the energy range 0.35  2.0 kev using version 11.2.0 of xspec .",
    "we adopted an absorbed power law model of the form    @xmath26    where f(@xmath27 ) is a normalization factor at @xmath28  kev , @xmath29 is the photon index and the photoelectric absorption is characterized by a column density n(x ) and an absorption cross section @xmath30 for each element @xcite .",

    "table  [ tab2 ] shows that emission steepens when the source gets fainter , a well known behavior for this source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to improve the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) we performed a simultaneous fit of the three datasets forcing the slope to be the same in the three observations , but leaving the normalization free to vary . for display purposes we combined all the three first order rgs-1 spectra together and did the same for the rgs-2 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the rgs effective areas ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) are complex in shape , and contain tens of narrow dips due to bad columns or pixels in the ccd detectors",
    ". the exact shape of these instrumental features in observed spectra depends on the grating line spread function ( lsf ) , which is particularly broad for reflection - gratings , due to electron scattering of dispersed photons ( i.e. @xmath35 m fwhm * ? ? ?",
    "* , figure  1 ) .",
    "modeling of such narrow instrumental features in the _ xmm - newton _ rgs requires , then , very accurate calibration measurements .",
    "current rgs effective area calibration uncertainties are as accurate as @xmath36% between 7 and 36  @xcite . as a consequence , residual narrow instrumental features with such relative intensities ,",
    "are expected in the unfolded rgs spectra ( both in absorption and emission ) .",
    "these are indeed observed in both rgs-1 and rgs-2 spectra of pks 2155 - 304 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) and greatly hamper the detection and proper identification of real physical bound - bound electronic transitions from abundant metals in astrophysical gaseous environments .",
    "however , in the wavelength range we are interested in , these problems differently affect the rgs-1 and rgs-2 .",
    "particularly , at redshifts between us and pks  2155 - 304 , all the strong resonant absorption lines from neutral and/or highly ionized o and ne , fall in wavelength ranges ( i.e. 13 - 14  , 18 - 20  , 20 - 24  ) where rgs-2 spectra either do not exist ( 20 - 24  , due to the failure of a ccd chip ) or contain strong line - like shaped instrumental features ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "rgs-1 spectra are , on the other hand , relatively instrumental - feature - free in the relevant oxygen wavelength ranges ( fig.[fig2 ] ) . in the following , we present our analysis of the rgs-1 spectra of pks  2155 - 304 , and",
    "use the rgs-2 spectra only for comparison .",
    "we modeled the rgs-1 and rgs-2 continuum of from the summed spectra in the energy range 0.35  2.0 kev with the same absorbed power law model described above and the results are reported in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the best fit to the spectra ( binned over two channels ) and the residuals .",
    "clearly visible in the residuals of rgs-1 spectrum is the o - edge at @xmath37  and the ovii k@xmath38 at 21.6  .",
    "the rgs-2 residuals , show instead a pronounced dip around @xmath39  and a deviation from a power law below 14  .",
    "all these features , but the 21.6   line , are also present in the calibration spectrum presented in @xcite rgs calibration report and are due to an imperfect knowledge of the effective area .    to determine the line parameters we prefer the simultaneous fit of the three data sets because we can promptly see false absorptions caused by flickering hot pixels / columns in an observation which appear normal in the other observations , and",
    "can remove the problematic data set from the fitting procedure ( e.g. ovii k@xmath40 , see table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "to better model the underlying continuum in the proximity of absorption / emission features , we did not adopt the broad band absorbed power law results presented above , but we divided the rgs-1 and rgs-2 spectra into @xmath41  wavelength bins and performed a simultaneous fit with a local absorbed power law . in the following sections we will discuss the features with significance @xmath42  @xmath2 .      to determine the absolute line position in rgs-1 we used the 23.5  interstellar oi 1s@xmath62p line (",
