    "in particular , it was observed that a much narrower stress distribution arose for the finite element analyses than for that extracted from atomistics .",

    "while these efforts have achieved some degree of success , they have been limited in how they use the data from the evolution of explicit dislocations to enhance the fidelity of the plasticity models considered . in general , only the global stress - strain response of a system containing a distribution of dislocations is used to parameterize the hardening behavior ; no local information is used to connect the two models . in particular , a direct comparison of the dislocation density tensor field ( ddt ) resulting from the evolution of the dislocation distribution in the case of dd and from the plastic deformation in the case of cp has not been considered thus far .",

    "such comparison is performed for torsion of wires with square cross section .",

    "since our system size and total line density are at the threshold of being able to be resolved given the estimated minimum asymptotic scale , we average the dd data through the @xmath121-axis since slices of the solution are nominally equivalent along the twist axis .",

    "[ fig : torsion110 ] show the two dimensional projection of the in - plane components of the dislocation density tensor for the @xmath118 and @xmath136 orientations of the wire , respectively . in general , the @xmath1 fields generated with dd and cp are only comparable up to a divergence - free / solenoidal field _",
    "i.e._@xmath89 gradient of scalar function does not contribute to @xmath1 ( which follows directly from a helmholtz decomposition of @xmath89 ) . also , the solutions have nominal 90 degree rotation and inversion symmetry .",
    "the fields resulting from both dd and cp have comparable magnitudes . and yet , the @xmath1 fields generated by dd have significant components in the center of wire , unlike cp . in the @xmath118 orientation case ,",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath1 components are similar ; but in the @xmath136 case the weak pattern correspondence breaks down due to more dispersed nature of dislocation line density .",
    "as mentioned , in dd lines are generated at high stress regions at the lateral edges of the prismatic wire and migrate to the rss basins either diagonal or crossing the midpoints of the wire s cross - section . in contrast , in a cp simulation , a background of mobile , geometrically necessary dislocations are assumed to be present everywhere and plastic slip occurs in regions of high stress . in cp",
    "there is no mechanism for explicit generation of dislocations nor compatibility of plastic slip induced by the motion of the implicit dislocation network .",
    "hence , the dislocation density field produced by cp only responds to the regions of high rss , and there is no driving force for migration / flow of dislocation density to low rss basins .",
    "as a last comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig : torsion_m_comp ] shows the sensitivity of the dislocation density field for the @xmath118 case predicted by cp to the flow rule exponent @xmath130 .",
    "clearly the significant dislocation density approaches the center of the cross - section and the `` @xmath148 '' pattern becomes more prominent and sharper with increased @xmath130 showing better correspondence with the dd results .",
    "an explanation for this better correspondence is discussed in the concluding section . due to numerical issues with the form the simple flow rule it was not possible to increase @xmath130 to further improve the correspondence with the dd results .",
    "in this work , we have established that a simple cp model calibrated to dd data can produce similar microstructural fields as well as overall response .",
    "this similarity is predicated on resolving the dislocation density field at a scale above the intermediate asymptotic length scale intrinsic to the material with its native dislocation population . for the material we examined , cu with line density @xmath149 m@xmath150 , we established that the minimum asymptotic scale is approximately 500 @xmath133 .",
    "physically , the asymptotic scale is determined by how densely dislocation lines pack after being generated at high rss regions and migrating to low rss regions . in particular , we estimated the scale at which continuum dislocation density fields should appear with nominally homogeneous simulations where there is little difference between high and low rss regions . this estimate proved robust in constructing dislocation density fields in the inhomogeneous loading cases we considered . for the finite systems we examined , it appears that the dislocation pile - ups on particular slip planes reach a characteristic spacing due to the fact that forces between dislocations scale as @xmath151 , while forces due to the applied stress scale as @xmath133 ( refer to chap .",
    "21 in @xcite ) . is the burgers vector of the material . ]",
    "hence , we conjecture that the asymptotic scale for the dislocation density is strongly dependent on material and less dependent on the particular loading case .    by examining eq .",
    "( [ eq : hardy_alpha ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : hardy_rho ] ) , the connection between the dislocation line density @xmath152 and dislocation density tensor @xmath1 can be seen .",
    "clearly @xmath152 indicates the general magnitude of @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e._there are no @xmath1 contributions where @xmath152 is zero ; but , @xmath1 adds vectorial information from the line direction as well as from the burgers vector , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hardy_alpha ] ) in contrast , with a cp model the dislocation density @xmath1 results from the curl of the plastic deformation gradient through the cp flow rule , eq .",
    "( [ eq : flow_rule ] ) .",
    "so , unlike the explicit representation of dislocation lines in dd , cp , through its flow rule , conflates generation and migration and only creates mobile slip in high stress / deformation gradient regions .",
    "moreover it simulates the hardening due to entanglement of dislocation lines with the flow rule .",
    "a loose correspondence can be made between the cp flow rule and the dynamics of the dislocation lines that governs dd evolution .",
    "the peach - kohler forces driving the dislocation dynamics are analogous to the resolved shear stresses driving plastic evolution in the flow rule so that the dislocation line velocity is proportional to the peach - kohler force , and the plastic slip rate is proportional to the local resolved shear stress . from our results , is it clear that , although the global response of corresponding dd and cp models can be made the same , the microstructural dislocation density tensor field is much more sensitive to details of the calibrated flow rule .",
    "although algorithmic stability issues prevented us from exploring the response of flow rules with high exponents , we were able to show that increased exponent tends to improve the qualitative similarity of the in - plane @xmath1 fields for a prismatic wire in torsion where there is a strong tendency for the dislocation network to align with geometric features .",
    "it stands to reason that this improvement will saturate before the @xmath116 limit is reached , where plastic slip , and by analogy dislocation velocity , is insensitive to rss magnitude .",
    "in fact , it is hard to imagine how a flow rule could be constructed to perfectly represent the @xmath1 patterns seen with dd unless some compatibility of the plastic slip representing dislocation motion is enforced .",
    "this modeling direction is currently being developed within the framework of _ continuum dislocation theory _ , as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where dislocation densities are independent field quantities evolving according to transport equations , and plastic slip is computed from dislocation fluxes .    in general , the continuum field , @xmath1 given by eqs . and",
    ", captures the ( geometrically necessary ) dislocation density and is a quantitative measure useful in understanding the microstructures that result from large strains in the plastic regime .",
    "this tensor can be used in the yield function of macroscopic phenomenological theories of plasticity to reproduce realistic dislocation microstructures .",
    "such models form alternatives to the crystal - plasticity formulations based on active slip systems .",
    "for example , @xcite include the ddt in the yield function , and develop a rate - independent macroscopic theory based on material symmetry .",
    "as the authors demonstrate , inclusion of ddt in the yield function introduces an additional length - scale into the macroscopic theory . using this length - scale as a parameter ,",
    "@xcite have shown the formation of dislocation microstructures with spatially localized ddt similar to our work . for similar structures ,",
    "the value of the length - scale in the theory are also similar to the range of intermediate asymptotic length scales that we estimated are needed to obtain a field description of the ddt from the dd simulations .",
    "this suggests that performing dd simulations to evaluate the ddt tensor may serve as a practical tool for calibrating and validating the phenomenological theories of plasticity . also the correspondence between dd and cp",
    "could perhaps be improved by using a flow rule with explicit dependence on the ddt computed from the plastic deformation gradient .",
