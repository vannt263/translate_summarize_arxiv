    "in recent times , the studies on the thermoelectric properties of various compounds both using experiments , theoretical and computational tools has focused in the search for new functional materials that could be used in the fabrication of energy - recovery devices based on a thermoelectric effect .",
    "oxides are promising in principle because of their chemical stability and possibility of usage in high temperature devices .",
    "particularly , misfit layered cobaltates have drawn significant attention.@xcite large thermopower together with metallic conductivities place that family as one of the most relevant and thoroughly studied within the oxides .",
    "one electronic structure reason behind their interesting thermoelectric properties is the existence of two electronic systems within those cobaltates.@xcite due to the trigonally distorted octahedral environment , the t@xmath4 bands are split between a highly mobile wide band that drives metallic conduction ( of e@xmath5 character ) and a more localized band ( with a@xmath6 parentage ) , narrow in nature that provides a large seebeck coefficient.@xcite    the search for new oxide compounds that could present a similar thermoelectric response is an interesting issue to be pursued . in this paper",
    "we will argue that a possible candidate family for that sake are a particular kind of layered nickelates : hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath7 .",
    "this compound and others related to it have drawn the attention of the community for various reasons : i ) la@xmath0nio@xmath7 is isostructural with the parent compound of the high - t@xmath8 cuprates:@xcite nio@xmath0 planes with a square planar coordination around the metal cations form the building blocks of this layered material , with la acting as spacer between the layers , ii ) an interesting temperature - induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) occurs in it,@xcite iii ) it is possible to lower further the valence of the ni cation in a layered structure to compare it with superconducting cuprates , not only in terms of structure but also with the same electron count.@xcite back in the eighties , the mit was explained by goodenough and ramasesha@xcite as occurring in a system where two different @xmath9-states coexist around the fermi level , having clearly distinct band widths .",
    "this is reminiscent of the above mentioned cobaltates , but in this case two different e@xmath10 bands exist , a more localized d@xmath11 and a more itinerant @xmath12 band .",
    "these yield reasonable conductivities , and also due to the existence of a more localized set of narrow bands , interesting values of the thermopower could emerge .",
    "experimental studies of the seebeck coefficient in la@xmath0nio@xmath7 show promising values exceeding 100 @xmath13v / k at room temperature,@xcite ( the typical minimum value for a material to be considered a high performance thermoelectric ) even though most reports with oxygen - rich samples show smaller values ( we will argue below what the reason for this is ) .",
    "the electrical conductivity is larger in the nio@xmath0 planes,@xcite which is the expected behavior for such a layered structure . to obtain an estimate of the thermoelectric performance of a material , it is common to use the so - called figure of merit , which is defined as the dimensionless quantity @xmath14=@xmath2ts@xmath15/@xmath16 .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath17 1 is required for applications.@xcite with the best values obtained experimentally for @xmath18 @xmath19100 @xmath13v / k,@xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 5 m@xmath22.cm @xcite and @xmath16 @xmath21 7.5 w / m.k,@xcite a @xmath14 at room temperature of about 0.01 can be estimated , which is comparable to other promising compounds such as crn,@xcite particularly so because of the large room for improvement , some of which we will discuss in this paper . in particular , the layered structure of the compound would be prone to yield better conductivity when grown in the form of thin films , and this has been shown in the past.@xcite a thin film geometry would hamper thermal conductivity along the c - axis , which would eventually improve the thermoelectric figure of merit as long as the thermopower and the mobility are not reduced.@xcite also , oxygen excess can lead to hole doping and a corresponding increase in electrical conductivity . a vast amount of experimental information exists on the thermoelectric and transport properties of la@xmath0nio@xmath7 .",
    "however , an exact account of the oxygen content is necessary to obtain good systematics , and this is not easily found in literature , probably due to complications in the correct determination and stabilization of a particular oxygen content .    in this paper we will explore a possible path towards an improved thermoelectric response via oxygen doping .",
    "we will discuss in particular how moving the system into the more itinerant limit by hole doping can reduce further the importance of the phononic part of the thermal conductivity ( that works against a good thermoelectric performance ) relative to the electronic part , and also improving the figure of merit if a decrease in the thermopower is prevented . concerning the magnetic order , it has been shown that la@xmath0nio@xmath7 is an antiferromagnet with an in - plane ordering such that an antiferromagnetic ( af ) interaction between nearest neighbor ni atoms is stabilized .",
    "the commensurability of the ordering has been put into question,@xcite but careful studies with respect to the oxygen content show how the nel temperature is significant even at values of @xmath23 @xmath21 0.1,@xcite and could vanish at @xmath23 @xmath21 0.14.@xcite we will focus our calculations in that doping level ( @xmath23 @xmath24 0.15 ) , close to the localized electron limit where magnetic order is present at low temperature and our dft calculations , that assume a magnetically ordered phase at zero temperature can describe the system more accurately . all calculations presented here will have that type of ordering imposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ compdet ] will present the calculation details , section [ results ] will describe the electronic structure , analyze the thermoelectric properties calculated for various oxygen contents , and finally we will summarize the main conclusions of the work in section [ summary ] .",
    "our electronic structure calculations were performed within density functional theory@xcite using the all - electron , full potential code wien2k@xcite based on the augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( apw+lo ) basis set.@xcite we will present calculations of the electronic structure and transport properties obtained with various exchange - correlation functionals and for several doping levels . for the exchange - correlation functional in the calculations at u= 0 , we have used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof version of the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) .    to deal with strong correlation effects that are widely acknowledged to play an important role in this type of nickelates ,",
    "we apply the lda+@xmath25 scheme @xcite that incorporates an on - site coulomb repulsion u and hund s rule coupling strength j@xmath26 for the ni @xmath27 states . for the uncorrelated part of the exchange - correlation functional we used the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite in that case .",
    "the lda+@xmath25 scheme utilized is the so - called  fully localized limit\"@xcite ( fll ) .",
    "a description of the results obtained at different values of u ( in a reasonably broad range 4.5 - 8.5 ev for the ni cations ) was performed , but results presented here will be for u= 7 ev .",
    "no significant changes in the main conclusions of the paper are found within that range of u values . for a discussion of the effects of a different choice of u and lda+@xmath25 method in similar layered nickelates ,",
    "see ref . .",
    "the value chosen for the on - site hund s rule strength is j = 0.68 ev and is kept fixed .    also , the recently developed tran - blaha modified becke - johnson ( tb - mbjlda ) potential was used.@xcite this potential has been shown to provide an accurate account of the electronic structure of correlated compounds@xcite using a parameter - free description , also yielding accurate band gaps for most semiconductors .",
    "all calculations were fully converged with respect to all the parameters used . in particular , we used r@xmath28k@xmath29= 7.0 , a k - mesh of 10 @xmath30 10 @xmath30 4 , and muffin - tin radii of 2.35 a.u . for la , 1.97 a.u . for ni and 1.75 a.u . for o.",
    "the transport properties were calculated using a semiclassical solution based on the boltzmann transport theory within the constant scattering time approximation by means of the boltztrap code , that uses the energy eigenvalues calculated by the wien2k code.@xcite in this case , denser k - meshes are required , in our case up to 40 @xmath30 40 @xmath30 15 to reach convergence . the constant scattering time approximation assumes the relaxation time @xmath31 as energy - independent .",
    "this results in an expression of both the thermopower and the thermoelectric figure of merit with no dependence on @xmath32 ( it can be directly obtained from the band structure without any assumed parameters ) .",
    "this approximation has been used succesfully to describe several thermoelectric materials.@xcite    to simulate small doping values we have used the virtual crystal approximation ( vca).@xcite this consists in modifying the total number of electrons in the system ( also the total atomic number for charge neutrality ) to simulate a particular doping level .",

    "typically , for this type of low - valence nickelate , with the ni@xmath34 cations in a square planar environment , one would expect the @xmath36 doublet fully occupied , and a higher position of the @xmath37 singlet competing in occupation with the e@xmath10 bands ( which are also split and will have significantly different band widths ) .",
    "the typical situation would be a lower @xmath37 band fully occupied and two e@xmath38 unoccupied bands , being the band gap@xcite of a distinct @xmath9-@xmath9 character .",
    "figure [ dos ] shows the calculated density of states ( dos ) for la@xmath0nio@xmath7 in an af solution , both for gga and a tb - mbjlda scheme together with the gga band structure in the lower panel .",
    "similar dos curves are obtained with the various functionals , the size of the gap being the main difference , and also some differences exist in the particular bandwidths and position of the bands , but even calculations with u= 0 yield an insulating solution as long as in - plane af order is set . in the plots ,",
    "we only show the e@xmath10 states of the ni cations since these have the dominant contribution above and immediately below the fermi level ( and we want to see them with some degree of clarity ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the square planar oxygen environment , the e@xmath10 states are significantly split , and differ substantially not only in position but in width .",
    "the @xmath12 band is higher in energy due to crystal - field splitting caused by the absence of apical oxygens around the ni cations , but it is slightly wider , whereas the @xmath33 band is lower but it is composed of more localized electrons ( it is narrower ) .",
    "one can see this very clearly in the band structure figure .",
    "the @xmath33 bands appear both in the gga and tb - mbjlda calculations much narrower , with less than 1 ev band width , being the corresponding width of the @xmath12 band at least 2 ev . in the band structure figure ( lower panel )",
    ", we can also see that not only the e@xmath10 levels are in the vicinity of the fermi level but also the t@xmath4 states are placed somewhat close to it , and are actually in the same enery region as the majority - spin d@xmath11 band .",
    "this is a narrow - gap oxide ( of only 70 mev@xcite according to resistivity measurements ) , but calculations show the gap is substantial ( 0.6 ev for gga , 1 ev for lda+@xmath25 at u= 7 ev and 2 ev for tbmbjlda ) .",
    "other narrow - gap oxides show this type of band gap overestimation coming out from calculations ( crn,@xcite sr@xmath39co@xmath40o@xmath41@xcite ) and still the calculations of the transport properties agree well with experiments .",
    "one possibility for this could be the fact that the low gap value obtained from resistivity measurements comes from shallow states in the gap , being the actual band gap much larger , as happens in crn.@xcite in the case of la@xmath0nio@xmath7 , a small band gap is consistent with the temperature - induced mit observed .",
    "the mit in this system has been described as a temperature - induced broadening of the @xmath12 band that eventually overlaps the occupied with the unoccupied band of opposite spin yielding metallic behavior at high temperature in the parent compound.@xcite our calculations confirm the description of the electronic structure that goodenough and ramasesha have done in the past,@xcite although we see that the t@xmath4 bands are located together with the majority @xmath33 band in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "the gga dos we show would anticipate that a sufficient temperature - induced broadening of the @xmath42 band would place the unoccupied band edge below that of the unoccupied @xmath43 band , which is significantly narrow .",
    "something similar can be expected for the tb - mbjlda calculation , but the largely overestimated gap makes the analysis a bit more adventurous .      as mentioned before , if somehow one can complement metallic conductivity with the maintenance of a large thermopower and a reduced thermal conductivity , the material could then be comparable to other oxides in thermoelectric performance.@xcite let us see how this can be done in this particular case . as can be seen ,",
    "the dos rises rapidly right below the top of the valence band ( @xmath12-character ) which is generally favorable for the thermopower .",
    "a similar heavy - electron band appears somewhat also in the electron - doping region just above the bottom of the conduction band ( in that case , of @xmath33 parentage ) although with less dispersive character .",
    "hence , the more localized @xmath33 band should contribute substantially to the seebeck coefficient in the hole - doping region as well , but its dos peak is very far from the fermi level to be attained by a relatively small hole - doping level .",
    "this would instead move the chemical potential into the occupied @xmath42 band with a noticeable increase in electrical conductivity .",
    "this band could also be sufficiently narrow to retain a substantial value of the thermopower if the chemical potential lies in a region inside the valence band comprising a large derivative of the density of states .         in order to see this in detail ,",
    "we can start by analyzing the electronic transport properties of the parent compound .",
    "we have calculated these for la@xmath0nio@xmath7 using various exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "our calculations were carried out using the semiclassical approach , within the constant scattering time approximation . yet ,",
    "the value of the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath14= t@xmath2s@xmath15/@xmath16 is independent of the scattering time chosen and so are the thermopower and @xmath2/@xmath16 , as long as the constant scattering time approximation is retained . in fig .",
    "[ zt ] we present the thermoelectric figure of merit as a function of the chemical potential calculated at 400 k using different exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "we study the electronic part only , we do not consider phonon terms in the thermal conductivity , which might be substantial in particular for the localized electron limit .",
    "thus , this electronic - only @xmath14 can be considered as a theoretical upper limit of the figure of merit for this system .",
    "we will see below how we can make an estimate of these effects based on the experimental data for @xmath2 and @xmath16 from refs . , and .",
    "nio@xmath1 af within gga , the lda+@xmath25 approach and tb - mbjlda . ]",
    "figure [ zt ] shows a reasonably large value of the thermoelectric figure of merit for the stoichiometric compound ( chemical potential at the top of the valence band ) , which is given by the large positive seebeck coefficient , in qualitative agreement ( see the discussion below ) with experimental observations at low-@xmath23 ( oxygen excess ) values.@xcite however , this is expected to be hampered by the large thermal conductivity due to phonons ( @xmath44 ) , which would substantially surpass its electronic counterpart ( @xmath45 ) , which is the only component we are analyzing with these calculations . in any case , moving towards the itinerant electron limit , when @xmath45 starts being comparable to @xmath44 , these results become more significant .",
    "we observe an interesting peak in the figure of merit in the hole - doping region ( oxygen excess , positive values of @xmath23 , negative chemical potential ) .",
    "this peak is present independently of the exchange - correlation functional used , but the characteristics ( height and position in chemical potential ) vary depending on the method used .    in this paper",
    "we try to describe a physical phenomenon that occurs in a range of physical parameters ( in this case @xmath23 , the oxygen excess ) in la@xmath0nio@xmath1 but the quantitative values of which are very difficult to obtain ab initio .",
    "the peak is related to the @xmath42 bands , as we can see comparing fig .",
    "[ zt ] with the dos plots in fig . [ dos ] ( the energy window of the large peak in @xmath14 lies inside that band ) .",
    "we also observe that other peaks in @xmath14 appear at higher hole - doping concentrations ( more negative chemical potential ) , related in that case with the @xmath33 and t@xmath4 bands .",
    "even though the @xmath33 band is certainly narrower , it does not provide a sufficiently high @xmath14 compared to @xmath42 ( a multipeak structure is predicted by the tb - mbjlda functional ) because it is merged in the same energy region as the t@xmath4 bands .",
    "if somehow band engineering could be done to bring the d@xmath11 band closer to the fermi level , the possible thermopower obtained could be enhanced taking benefit of the localized nature of the band , and at a significantly smaller doping level .",
    "the realization of this possibility looks difficult .",
    "it can also be oberved how @xmath14 becomes zero at about -0.3 ev simultaneously with the seebeck coefficient sign change from positive at low doping to negative at higher doping levels .",
    "a similar feature happens in the electron - doped region , @xmath18 goes from negative to positive when the system is further electron doped ( about 0.2 ev above the bottom of the conduction band ) .",
    "in order to characterize in more detail that first peak in @xmath14 at @xmath23 @xmath46 0 , and see how the amount of oxygen excess ( hole - doping ) relates to a particular change in chemical potential in the system we present in fig . [ s_vs_doping ] the calculated thermopower of the hole - doped system at 400 k for all the functionals used .",
    "since the behavior of @xmath2/@xmath16 is relatively monotonous both with temperature and doping , the behavior of the thermopower ( its peaks and sign changes ) gives the broad picture of how the figure of merit itself evolves .",
    "the dependence of the seebeck coefficient with both the doping level and the @xmath23 value is shown .",
    "a peak can be observed in all the curves although it is more pronounced for lda+@xmath25 and becomes broadened within tbmbjlda .",
    "the height of the peak is related to the width of the @xmath42 band , which is narrowed by the lda+@xmath25 method , and broadened by the tb - mbjlda scheme .",
    "an intermediate situation is given by uncorrelated gga .",
    "the doping level necessary to reach it depends on the relative position of that band with respect to the fermi level in the calculations , gga placing it further away than the other methods ( see fig .",
    "[ dos ] , top panel ) . it can be seen that for lda+@xmath25 the peak is located at @xmath23@xmath21 0.03 , whereas for gga and tb - mbjlda it appears at higher doping levels @xmath21 0.06 and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the above described sign change of the seebeck coefficient in the hole - doped region can be seen for both gga and lda+@xmath25 at @xmath23 close to 0.15 ( larger , beyond the values of doping we are studying here , for tb - mbjlda ) .",
    "this has been observed experimentally@xcite for values around @xmath23 @xmath21 0.20 , in good agreement with the result obtained from our calculations .",
    "all these calculations were obtained for the parent undoped compound la@xmath0nio@xmath7 as a function of the chemical potential , what could be called a rigid - band approach .",
    "we will argue below how the picture is modified when vca is applied .",

    "@xmath53 t @xmath21 0.1 is predicted from our calculations at high temperature if the proper oxygen content is chosen . in any case , the growth in the form of thin films with the appropriate oxygen content would increase the electrical conductivity and reduce the phonon thermal conductivity .",

    "our ab initio calculations for the compound indicate some promising features of hole - doped la@xmath0nio@xmath7 as a possible oxide thermoelectric compound .",
    "if the thermal conductivity can be reduced by nanostructuring , e.g. in the form of thin films , the system could show enhanced thermoelectric performance at low hole - doping levels , attainable by the appropriate control of the apical oxygen content .",
    "our calculations show that a region with relatively large seebeck coefficient exists in this compound at small doping levels , within the realistic af description .",
    "a careful experimental study needs to be performed in this respect controlling the oxygen content , and also making thin films with the appropriate oxygen composition .",
    "hole - doping will increase the conductivity , as the thin film geometry does , which together with the reduction in thermal conductivity could leave room for an improvement of the thermoelectric figure of merit of this layered nickelate . in terms of the electronic structure ,",
