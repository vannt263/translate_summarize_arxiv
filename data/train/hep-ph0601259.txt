    "at tev energies , strong interactions enter a regime in which hadron  hadron and electron / photon  hadron cross sections can become comparable to the `` geometric size '' of hadrons , and unitarity becomes an essential feature of the dynamics . in qcd , the approach to the unitarity regime is driven by the increase of the gluon density in hadrons at small @xmath0 .",
    "theoretical studies so far have mostly focused on incorporating unitarity effects in qcd evolution equations based on the large @xmath3 approximation ( bfkl evolution ) @xcite . however , such calculations are of practical relevance only in situations where the amount of glue produced by @xmath3enhanced radiation exceeds by far that originating from other sources .",
    "it is known that there is a large non - perturbative gluon density in the proton at a low scale ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "its physical origin may be seen in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which implies that a significant fraction of the nucleon s momentum should be carried by gluon fields .",
    "this large non - perturbative gluon density is the reason behind the success of the dglap evolution equations  based on the large @xmath5 approximation and retaining only first ( lo ) or second ( nlo ) powers of @xmath3  in describing the hera dis data .",
    "theoretical studies indicate that @xmath3resummation effects are small down to @xmath6 @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "dglap evolution , starting from the non - perturbative gluon density at the low scale , leads to a rapid growth of the gluon density at small @xmath0 .",
    "this strongly suggests that unitarity effects become important long before the region of @xmath3 dominance is reached .",
    "recently , we have proposed a simple framework for studying the approach to the unitarity limit within the dglap approximation @xcite .",
    "our formulation makes use of the correspondence between the standard qcd factorization theorems for hard processes and the dipole picture of small@xmath0 scattering in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "this framework allows one to approach the question of unitarity at small @xmath0 on the basis of the vast amount of data on hard processes in @xmath1 scattering at hera ( inclusive , diffractive , and exclusive ) and @xmath7 scattering at the tevatron .",
    "in particular , we incorporate information about the transverse spatial distribution of gluons in the proton , obtained from studies of exclusive vector meson ( @xmath8 ) production at hera ( generalized parton distributions ) . based on this information , we show that the interaction of small  size color singlet configurations with the proton approaches the `` black  disk limit '' ( bdl ) at small @xmath0 .",
    "this new dynamical regime is marginally visible in diffractive dis at hera , and will be fully reached in central @xmath2 collisions at lhc , where it will have numerous qualitative implications for the hadronic final state . in these proceedings",
    "we briefly summarize the theoretical arguments leading to the bdl , and the evidence for it in presently available small@xmath0 data ( hera , tevatron ) . for details , as well as for a discussion of the implications for @xmath2 collisions at lhc",
    ", we refer to refs .",
    "at small @xmath0 , @xmath9 scattering with longitudinal polarization can be viewed as the scattering of small  size color  singlet quark / gluon configurations in the photon wave function from the proton .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood from the space  time evolution in the target rest frame , in which the virtual photon typically fluctuates into a @xmath10 pair of transverse size @xmath11 a long time , @xmath12 , before hitting the target .",
    "formally , it can be shown that the leading @xmath5 approximation for the dis cross section , @xmath13 , is equivalent to the scattering of a @xmath10 dipole from the proton with cross section @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 dipoles , @xmath17 ) .",
    "the cross section , which vanishes for small dipoles ( `` color transparency '' ) , is proportional to the gluon density in the proton , evaluated at an effective scale @xmath18 .",
    "we stress that , by the derivation from the factorized dis cross section , the gluon density in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_inel_lt ] ) is unambiguously determined as the leading  twist gluon density in the leading @xmath5 approximation .",
    "in particular , it is subject to dglap evolution , which produces a strong rise at small @xmath0 , and implies a rapid growth of the dipole cross section with increasing energy .",
    "the crucial question is at which energies unitarity leads to a breakdown of this approximation .",
    "though restricted to the leading  log approximation , the dipole picture with eq .",
    "( [ sigma_inel_lt ] ) is useful for discussing qualitative features of the hera inclusive dis data , such as the breakdown of the leading ",
    "twist approximation at small @xmath0 for @xmath19 , and the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the extension to diffractive final states requires one to explicitly consider @xmath21 configurations in the photon wave function .",
    "diffractive dis thus allows one to probe the interaction of small  size quark / gluon configurations with hadronic matter in much more detail than inclusive dis .",
    ", from @xmath22 photoproduction ( @xmath23 )",
    ". the increase between @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be attributed to the pion cloud @xcite .",
    "for details see refs .",
    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    to study the role of unitarity in hard processes at small @xmath0 , we need to know not only the total density of gluons in the proton , but also their spatial distribution in the transverse plane .",
    "this information comes from studies of exclusive vector meson production ( @xmath26 ) in @xmath27 scattering at small @xmath0 . on grounds of a general qcd factorization theorem ,",
    "the amplitudes for these processes can be expressed in terms of the gluon generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) in the proton ( here in the approximation of zero `` skewness '' ) , @xmath28 @xmath29 is the normalized two ",
    "gluon formfactor , which can directly be extracted from the @xmath30dependence of the differential cross section , @xmath31 .",
    "its fourier transform with respect to the transverse momentum transfer to the proton , @xmath32 , @xmath33 describes the distribution of gluons ( with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 ) with regard to transverse position , @xmath34 , normalized according to @xmath35 .",
    "extensive studies of @xmath22 photo / electroproduction at hera have demonstrated the applicability of the qcd factorization formulae , with corrections due to the finite transverse size of the vector meson @xcite .",
    "together with @xmath22 photoproduction data from fixed  target experiments at lower energies , these data have produced a detailed picture of the transverse spatial distribution of gluons at @xmath36 over a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "the proton s average transverse gluonic size increases with decreasing @xmath0 , see fig  [ fig : size ] .",
    "various dynamical mechanisms have been identified , which contribute to this growth in different regions of @xmath0 @xcite . at higher @xmath37 ,",
    "the growth with decreasing @xmath0 is slower , because dglap evolution with increasing @xmath37 effectively probes higher and higher @xmath0 values in the input distribution at the starting scale .",
    "an important observation is that the average transverse radius of the distribution of gluons with significant momentum fraction , @xmath38 , is _ considerably smaller _ than the radius of soft hadronic interactions in high",
    " energy @xmath2 collisions .",
    "this implies that @xmath2 events with hard processes involving two partons with @xmath39 ( _ e.g. _ , dijet production ) originate from much more central collisions than minimum bias events @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the dipole picture in the leading @xmath5 approximation , _ cf .",
    "_  eq .  ( [ sigma_inel_lt ] ) , and the information about the transverse spatial distribution of gluons , we can study the approach to the unitarity regime in hard processes at small @xmath0 .",
    "the problem can be formulated in the language of an optical model for hadron ",
    "hadron scattering .",
    "we consider the elastic scattering amplitude for a small  size color dipole from the proton in impact parameter representation ( see fig .  [ fig : dp_impact ] ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the profile function .",
    "using the optical theorem , the inelastic ( total minus elastic ) cross section can be expressed in terms of the profile function as @xmath42 the function @xmath43 can be interpreted as the probability for inelastic interaction in dipole ",
    "proton scattering at a given impact parameter , @xmath44 .",
    "it tends to unity if @xmath45 in optics , this limit corresponds to the scattering from a black disk , whence eq .",
    "( [ bdl ] ) is referred to as the `` black  disk limit '' ( bdl ) of dipole ",
    "hadron scattering .    in the leading  twist",
    "( lt ) approximation , the distribution @xmath43 is given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma_inel_lt ] ) , with the total gluon density replaced by the local density in transverse space .",
    "while the lt formula is meaningful only as long as @xmath46 , we can use it to study the _ breakdown _ of the lt approximation and the onset of the bdl regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile ] shows the result for @xmath47 obtained in this approximation , for both @xmath10 ( left scale ) and @xmath16 ( right scale ) dipoles .",
    "one sees that the profile function approaches the bdl , eq .",
    "( [ bdl ] ) , at small impact parameters , even for small dipole sizes , once @xmath0 becomes sufficiently small .",
    "the reason is the growth of the gluon density in the proton at small @xmath0 due to dglap evolution .    , eq .",
    "( [ dp_impact ] ) , as obtained from the lo dglap gluon density , _ cf . _  eq .  ( [ sigma_inel_lt ] ) , and a phenomenological parametrization of the transverse spatial distribution of gluons @xcite . shown",
    "are the results for dipoles of size @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and various values of @xmath50 .",
    "the left axes refer to @xmath10 dipoles , the right axes to @xmath16 dipoles.,width=396 ]",
    "inclusive @xmath27 scattering in lo corresponds to the scattering of a @xmath10 dipole from the proton .",
    "one sees that the bdl regime becomes marginally relevant at the upper end of the hera energy range ( @xmath51 ) for @xmath4 ( corresponding to @xmath52 ) .",
    "we emphasize that in the dipole picture only the longitudinal cross section , @xmath13 , is dominated by small  size dipoles .",
    "the transverse cross section , @xmath20 , receives significant contributions from large  size configurations in the virtual photon even for substantial @xmath37 , and is thus not a suitable observable for probing the bdl in hard interactions .",
    "more sensitive to the onset of the bdl regime are diffractive processes in @xmath9 scattering , which probe the interaction of @xmath21 dipoles with the target .",
    "the fact that the probability for gluon ",
    "induced diffraction , @xmath53 , is experimentally close to its maximum value , 1/2 , at the upper end of the hera energy range indicates that the interaction of such dipoles with the proton is close to the bdl @xcite .",
    "much smaller values of @xmath0 than in @xmath1 scattering can be probed in hard processes induced by leading partons in high  energy @xmath2 collisions . at lhc ( @xmath54 ) , a parton in the `` projectile '' proton with momentum fraction @xmath55 , in a hard collision producing a final state with transverse momentum @xmath56 , resolves partons in the `` target '' with @xmath57 in the dipole picture , such parton ",
    "parton processes can predominantly be associated with scattering of @xmath16 dipoles from the target ( for which the cross section is @xmath58 times larger than for @xmath10 dipoles ) , with @xmath59 . under these conditions , the dipole ",
    "proton interaction for central collisions is deep inside the bdl regime , see figure  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the approach to the bdl qualitatively changes the interactions of leading partons in central @xmath2 collisions .",
    "they acquire substantial transverse momenta through their interaction with the dense medium of small@xmath0 gluons , @xmath60 for @xmath55 in the estimate of ref .  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "one expects significantly larger transverse momenta and lower multiplicity in forward particle production , as well as other qualitative changes in the hadronic final state @xcite .",
    "these effects can be observed by selecting central @xmath2 collisions with a trigger on hard dijet production at central rapidities ( see above ) @xcite .",
    "such measurements are feasible with the cms and totem detectors at lhc .",
    "evidence for the bdl in existing @xmath61 data is the observation that the @xmath2 elastic scattering amplitude above the tevatron energy ( @xmath62 ) seems to be `` black '' at central impact parameters , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the bdl all leading ( valence ) quarks acquire large transverse momenta due to hard interactions , making it impossible for the proton wave functions to remain coherent @xcite . +",
