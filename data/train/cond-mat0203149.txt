    "the problem of enumerating close - packed dimers on a finite simple - quartic net was solved by temperley and fisher @xcite and by kasteleyn @xcite in 1961 .",
    "an outstanding related but yet unsolved problem is the enumeration of dimers on a net with vacant sites @xcite . here",
    ", we consider this vacancy problem when a single vacant site occurs on the boundary .",
    "the difficulty associated with the vacancy problem is that , while the determinant whose square root yieids the dimer generating function can be written down using the kasteleyn formulation @xcite , its evaluation is difficult . in 1974",
    "temperley @xcite reported an intriguing bijection relating close - packed dimer coverings with spanning tree configurations on two related lattices .",
    "this offers an alternate approach to the vacancy problem since spanning trees can be enumerated by standard means .",
    "the temperley bijection has been of renewed recent interest and extended to graphs with certain weighted and/or directional edges @xcite .",
    "here , we use an extension of the temperley bijection due to kenyon , propp , and wilson @xcite to study the vacancy dimer problem .",
    "our first result is that , for a simple - quartic net with free boundaries and one fixed vacant site located at certain specific sites on the boundary , the dimer generating function is independent of the position of the vacancy . the exact generating function for close - packed dimers on this net",
    "is then deduced from that of the spanning trees . in view of the connection with the conformal field theory @xcite and current interests in finite - size analyses for two - dimensional lattice models @xcite",
    ", we next carry out finite - size analyses for the weighted spanning tree solution as well as that of the fkt solution .",
    "it is found that a logarithmic correction term arises in the large - size expansion in the case of the vacancy problem with free boundaries , a term which is absent in the expansion of the fkt solution . a concrete example demonstrating this difference",
    "we also find that the occurrence of a vacancy yields a new central charge @xmath0 in the language of the conformal field theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : to make the paper self - contained , we restate and establish in section 2 the bijection due to temperley @xcite between spanning tree and dimer configurations , as well as an extended version of the bijection due to kenyon , propp , and wilson @xcite . this extended temperley bijection permits us to establish in section 3 the independence of the dimer generating function on the location of the vacancy when it occurs at specific boundary sites . the explicit expression of the generating function for a simple - quartic net is then obtained . in section 4",
    "we carry out finite - size analyses for weighted spanning trees and the fkt dimer solution . specializing the results to dimer enumerations",
    ", we find a logarithmic correction term which is unique to the vacancy problem with free boundaries .",
    "discussions and a summary of our findings are given in section 5 .",
    "for definiteness we consider a simple - quartic net ( lattice ) with free boundaries , although much of the results of this section also hold for more general planar graphs @xcite .",
    "first we restate the temperley bijection . starting from a @xmath2 simple - quartic net @xmath3 with free boundaries ,",
    "one constructs a dimer lattice @xmath4 by i ) adding a new site at the midpoint of each edge of @xmath3 , ii ) inserting in each internal face of @xmath3 a new site connected to the midpoints of the 4 edges of @xmath3 surrounding it , and iii ) removing one corner site of the resulting lattice and its incident edges on @xmath4 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 has a total of @xmath5 sites consisting of the original @xmath6 sites of @xmath3 , which we call the _ odd _ sites , and the remaining @xmath7 new sites , which we call the _ even _ sites .",
    "an example of this construction for @xmath8 is shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "a spanning tree is a collection of connected edges of @xmath3 which does not form closed circuits and covers all sites .",
    "then we have the    _ temperley bijection : there exists a one - one correspondence between spanning tree configurations on @xmath3 and dimer configurations on @xmath4 . _    to see that the bijection holds",
    ", one observes that to each spanning tree configuration on @xmath3 , one can construct a unique dimer configuration on @xmath4 by first laying a dimer along each tree edge , starting from the edge(s ) covering the corner site of @xmath4 which has ( have ) been removed , and proceed along the spanning tree edges in an obvious fashion . after laying dimers along all tree edges , the remaining sites of @xmath4 can then be covered by dimers in a unique way @xcite .",
    "conversely , starting from each dimer configuration on @xmath4 , one constructs a unique tree configuration on @xmath3 by drawing bonds ( tree edges ) along dimers originating from all odd sites .",
    "these bonds can not form close circuits , since otherwise they would have enclosed an odd number of sites of @xmath4 which is not permitted in close - packed dimer configurations .",
    "this process leads to a unique tree configuration on @xmath3 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "an example of the temperley bijection is shown in figs.2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "kenyon , propp , and wilson @xcite have shown that the temperley bijection holds more generally for graphs with certain weighted and/or directed edges . for our purposes , however , we shall confine ourselves to the original temperley bijection as stated in the above , with the step iii)replaced by one of removing an odd site on the boundary together with its incident edges .",
    "an example of constructing such a @xmath4 is shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "the proof of the bijection between tree configurations on @xmath3 and dimer coverings on @xmath4goes through as before , and we are led to the    _ extended temperley bijection ( temperley - kenyon - propp - wilson ) : there existsa one - one correspondence between spanning trees on @xmath3 and dimer coverings on any @xmath4 constructed from @xmath3 by removing any boundary odd site and its incident edges in step iii ) of the construction described in the above . _",
    "an example of such a bijection is shown in figs.2(a ) and 2(c ) .",
    "_ remark _ : the extended temperley bijection does not hold for dimer lattices @xmath4 containing an interior vacancy . in that case",
    "while each spanning tree can still be mapped into a unique dimer configuration as before , there exist dimer configurations which can not be mapped into spanning trees",
    ". these are dimer coverings with no dimers laying on any of the 4 edges of @xmath3 incident to the defect site .",
    "the dimer generating function for @xmath4 is @xmath9 where the summation is taken over all dimer covering configurations , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the weights of horizontal and vertical dimers . , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the number of horizontal and vertical dimers . clearly , we have @xmath14    consider two different dimer lattices @xmath4 and @xmath15 obtained from @xmath3 as described in the above , namely , by removing different boundary odd sites . then we have the following equivalence :    _ proposition 3.1.1 _ : @xmath16 _ for any @xmath4 and @xmath15_.    _ proof _ : the extended temperley bijection dictates that there is a one - one correspondence between spanning tree configurations on @xmath3 and dimer configurations on _ any _ @xmath4 .",
    "it follows that there is a bijection between dimer coverings on @xmath4 and @xmath15 , and that the summation in ( [ dimer ] ) on @xmath4 can be considered as taken over all spanning tree configurations on @xmath3 .    for each spanning tree configuration @xmath17 of @xmath3 ,",
    "the dimer weight in the summand in ( [ dimer ] ) consists of two factors , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the product of the weights of those dimers originating from odd sites , and @xmath20 is the product of the weights of those dimers covering two even sites . for the two dimer coverings of @xmath4 and @xmath15 corresponding to the same@xmath17 , their @xmath20 factors are the same by definition .",
    "their @xmath19 factors are also the same since , even though the respective dimer positions may be shifted , they lay along the same spanning tree edges hence carry the same weights .",
    "it follows that summations on the lhs and rhs of ( [ theorem ] ) are identical term by term , and the proposition is proved .",
    "_ remark _ : proposition 3.1.1 holds more generally for arbitrary planar @xmath3 and its related @xmath4 .",
    "since the overall dimer weight can always be factorized into the product @xmath21 as in ( [ prod ] ) , the proof of the proposition goes through as presented .",
    "we next consider the generating function of _ weighted _ spanning trees for the @xmath2 simple - quartic @xmath3 .",
    "assign weights @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , to edges in the horizontal and vertical direction .",
    "then , the weighted spanning tree generating function is @xmath22 where the summation is taken over all spanning tree configurations @xmath17 on @xmath3 and , as in ( [ dimer ] ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the numbers of edges in the spanning tree in the respective directions .",

    "it is seen from ( [ tree1 ] ) that if all dimers covering even sites of @xmath4 have the weight @xmath25 , namely @xmath26 , then the dimer generating function is simply @xmath27 .    more generally for a simple - quartic @xmath3 of size @xmath2 and the related @xmath4",
    ", we have the equivalence :    _ proposition 3.1.2 _ : @xmath28    _ proof _ : from the construction of @xmath4 we note that there are a total of @xmath29 even sites located at midpoints of horizontal edges of @xmath3 .",
    "we call these the @xmath30 sites . similarly , there are @xmath31 even sites of @xmath4 located at midpoints of vertical edges of @xmath3 , which we call the @xmath32 sites",
    ".    the @xmath30 and @xmath32 sites can be covered by either horizontal or vertical dimers .",
    "let @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) be the number of horizontal ( vertical ) dimers covering the @xmath30 sites .",

    "the proposition 3.1.2 now follows after eliminating @xmath37 and @xmath34 in ( [ gene1 ] ) using ( [ sum1 ] ) and ( [ sum2 ] ) .      for a simple - quartic @xmath3 of size @xmath2 with free boundaries , the generating function ( [ tree1 ] ) for",

    "<S> first , using a bijection between dimer and spanning tree configurations due to temperley , kenyon , propp , and wilson , we establish that the dimer generating function is independent of the location of the vacancy , and deduce a closed - form expression for the generating function . </S>",
    "<S> we next carry out finite - size analyses of this solution as well as that of the fkt solution . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses lead to a logarithmic correction term in the large - size expansion for the vacancy problem with free boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> a concrete example exhibiting this difference is given . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the central charge @xmath0 in the language of conformal field theory for the vacancy problem , as versus the value @xmath1 when there is no vacancy .    </S>",
    "<S> * key words : * dimers , spanning trees , finite - size analysis . </S>"
