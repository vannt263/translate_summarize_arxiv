    "the concept of anderson localization in the fock space of many - body systems has been recently adopted for the studies of interacting electrons in finite - size conductors .",
    "the traditional field of localization consists of the investigation of electronic motion in disordered solids .",
    "these studies were initiated by anderson @xcite who considered tight - binding hamiltonians on real - space lattices with random on - site energies . the behavior of the system was found to depend on the parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the typical variance of the random potential and @xmath2 is the hopping matrix element . for @xmath3 above some critical value the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian",
    "are exponentially localized with a characteristic scale @xmath4 , called the localization length , which leads to the absence of diffusion of electrons .",
    "the anderson problem inspired numerous studies ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling theory of localization @xcite predicted the strong dependence of the localization properties on the dimension of the lattice .",
    "it was found , for instance , that in one spatial dimension the states are always localized for any strength of the hopping .",
    "the ideas of localization can be extended to the investigation of the properties of interacting many - body hamiltonians in the basis of eigenstates of the corresponding free system .",
    "the central problem considered there is the mixing of a particular state representing one particle excited above the fermi surface with many - particle states responsible for emergence of a quasi - particle described by the usual landau fermi liquid theory . for this purpose",
    "the analogy between the one - particle and the many - body problems was demonstrated in @xcite by mapping the hilbert space of interacting electrons onto an effective tight - binding model .",
    "each site of the effective lattice represents the eigenstate of the non - interacting system and the bonds represent the interaction matrix elements .",
    "after several approximations , which consist mainly in neglecting the possibility of closed loops on this effective lattice , the resulting model was identified with the cayley tree with branching number @xmath5 depending on the energy @xmath6 of the initial excitation , representing a particle excited above the fermi sea .",
    "the cayley tree model was previously studied @xcite and was found to undergo a localization transition for the value of parameter @xmath7 . in the context of the original many - electron problem ,",
    "the system is in the localized regime of the many - particle states on the states of the non - interacting system for energy below the lower threshold @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the one - particle level - spacing and @xmath10 is dimensionless conductance , i.e. conductance in units of @xmath11 .",
    "it was also argued that until the excitation energy @xmath6 reaches another critical value @xmath12 the states are not completely delocalized , i.e. they do not mix large number of non - interacting states , but rather a small portion of them , corresponding to a subtree of the whole lattice .",
    "the last result was not confirmed in the subsequent studies @xcite of this model by super - symmetry methods .",
    "it was found there that the states are strongly correlated above the threshold @xmath13 .    in more recent numerical studies of the interacting models",
    "@xcite it was observed that the choice of the type of the lattice affects the localization - delocalization transition point .",
    "the crossover between the spectral statistics and the properties of eigenstates such as inverse participation ratio were shown to be sensitive to the type of the lattice .",
    "it was doubted that the actual transition and the properties of states in the delocalized phase can be accounted for properly using the pure tree - like structure of the lattice .",
    "it was claimed in @xcite that the infinite tree - like lattice used in @xcite may be inadequate for description of the splitting of the quasi - particle peak into many - body constituents .",
    "the finiteness of the lattice used in this work results in the absence of the sharp transition from localized to delocalized states . in the numerical work @xcite , where the possibility of closed loops on the lattice was taken into account using the random - matrix theory",
    "no delocalization transition was observed .",
    "rather the participation ratio and spectral width of the eigenstates of the interacting system exhibited a smooth crossover from almost localized to delocalized states .",
    "the exact solution for the delocalized phase ( which corresponds to the strongly interacting regime ) is not available in these studies in any limit",
    ". it would be useful to have a model which can clarify the nature of the extended states in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "the candidates for such a system are of course one - dimensional interacting system whose analytical solution is available for any strength of the interactions .",
    "the present work was inspired by the observation that the eigenstates of the simplest interacting problem , namely the chiral tomonaga - luttinger model @xcite are extended in the effective lattice of the non - interacting slater determinants .",
    "this model is usually solved by the bosonization technique , which can be viewed as a generalization of the solutions by fourier transform of tight - binding models without disorder .",
    "this analogy can be traced more explicitly if one considers the hilbert space spanned by the slater determinants as an effective lattice where each site is labeled by partition of some integer . due to the conservation of total momentum the hamiltonian of the chiral tomonaga - luttinger model",
    "is block - diagonal in the total momentum index @xmath14 and the linear dispersion implies that energies of all the states inside one block are degenerate and equal @xmath15 .",
    "the interactions lift this degeneracy mixing the slater determinants into coherent superpositions which are described by the bosonic quantum numbers .",
    "thus the bosonic eigenstates of the full interacting model can be viewed as a generalization of the extended bloch states in the tight - binding models with degenerate on - site energies .",
    "the linearization of the dispersion is the approximation which allows to solve the problem of interacting electrons in one dimension .",
    "the deviations from the linearity mixes the bosonic states , so they can not any longer provide the solution to the model . in this work we introduce the random dispersion into the tomonaga - luttinger model and study the properties of its eigenstates .",
    "it is expected to model a system where the single particle spectrum is complicated .",
    "the question we address is whether this model exhibits localization , since the randomness introduced into the dispersion leads to randomness of the diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian analogous to the diagonal disorder introduced into tight - binding anderson models .",
    "we have found that the states remain localized in the basis of slater determinants , i.e. resemble the states of the non - interacting systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review some known facts about the standard tomonaga - luttinger model .",
    "we describe the structure of the hilbert space as an effective lattice and discuss the bosonization solution in this context . in section 3",
    "we introduce randomness into the dispersion law of the tomonaga - luttinger model and simplify the interaction matrix .",
    "then we solve the resulting model with assumption of independence of the on - site energies .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of relevance of the correlations between the energies . in the last section",
    "the results are discussed and further investigations are proposed .",
    "in this section we review a model exactly solvable for any interaction strength .",
    "the simplest model of interacting fermions is the one - branch ( chiral ) tomonaga - luttinger model @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 label the one - particle orbital with convention that in the ground state @xmath17 of the non - interacting model , @xmath18 denotes the first unoccupied state . since a very large number of states",
    "is occupied ( the number of fermions is large ) the number @xmath16 can be allowed to run from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "another consequence is that the one - particle spectrum is assumed to be equidistant : @xmath21 .",
    "both the linear dispersion and the fact that the spectrum is unbound are crucial for the solubility of the model . introducing creation and annihilation operators",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 for a fermion on the orbital @xmath16 , with usual anti - commutation relations @xmath24 ( other anti - commutators vanish ) the hamiltonian of the problem can be written as @xmath25 the normal ordering of operators having infinite expectation values is defined as @xmath26 . as a result the constant @xmath27 absorbs the ( infinite ) free ground state energy together with the hartree term : @xmath28 the operator of `` total momentum '' @xmath29 commutes with the full hamiltonian . due to the linear dispersion",
    "this operator is proportional to the free part of the hamiltonian , i.e. the first term on the rhs of ( [ ham ] ) .    instead of solving this model by the standard method of bosonization using identities among second quantized operators",
    "( see for example @xcite ) we prefer to reformulate our interacting problem in order to relate it to the problems usually discussed within the framework of anderson localization .",
    "we start by labeling the eigenstates of non - interacting problem , which are the familiar slater determinants , by shifts of particles with respect to the non - interacting ground state as shown in the fig .",
    "[ shifts ] : the uppermost particle is shifted up @xmath30 levels , the second one is shifted up @xmath31 levels etc .",
    "the numbers @xmath32 are defined to satisfy @xmath33 for each @xmath34 . if a particle is not shifted it is not recorded .",
    "the set @xmath35 of positive integers satisfying @xmath36 forms the set of partitions of @xmath14 and is conveniently displayed by a young diagram  array with @xmath32 boxes in the @xmath34-th row .",
    "following the standard notations in the mathematical literature the numbers @xmath32 will be referred to as _ parts _ in what follows .",
    "for example , the partition of @xmath37 , @xmath38 sometimes written as @xmath39 that is displayed in fig .  [ shifts ] is represented graphically as @xmath40 this pictorial representation of slater determinants has nice properties under particle - hole interchange : recording shifts of the holes ( which are moved downwards in energy ) rather than particles in fig .",
    "[ shifts ] yields the partition @xmath41 whose graphical representation is just the transpose of the young diagram for @xmath35 : @xmath42 partition @xmath43 is said to be conjugate or dual to @xmath35 .",
    "this duality results from the fact that each move of a particle upwards is accompanied by a move of a hole downwards .",
    "the eigenstates of the non - interacting hamiltonian labeled by partitions of @xmath14 are degenerate and their energy is given by @xmath44 the interactions conserve this number .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is therefore block - diagonal and does not mix the partitions of different @xmath14 so we can restrict ourselves to the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by partitions of @xmath14 .",
    "the dimensionality of this subspace is given by @xmath45  the number of partitions of @xmath14 .",
    "there is no closed analytical expression for this number but the euler expression @xcite for the generating function @xmath46 allows to obtain the asymptotic behavior of @xmath45 for large @xmath14 and it is given by the formula of hardy - ramunajan : @xmath47 it demonstrates that the number of `` sites '' in the subspace increases rapidly with @xmath14 .",
    "since for a given subspace @xmath14 the free part of the hamiltonian is proportional to the unit matrix the solution consists in diagonalization of the interacting part @xmath48 . the interaction term in ( [ ham ] ) is conveniently represented in our picture as effective binding between the sites . in order to present the results in a compact and transparent way we drop the requirement on a partition labeling the basis state to be represented by a non - increasing sequence . instead we extend the notion to any finite sequence of integers ( either positive or negative or zero ) and use the following rules to relate this sequence to the standard ( non - increasing ) partition :    1 .",
    "_ in any sequence @xmath49 two consecutive parts may be interchanged provided that the preceding part is decreased by unity and the succeeding part increased by unity , the state vector which corresponds to this partition acquires a minus sign _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath50 3 .",
    "_ if the last part of the sequence is negative the partition corresponds to the zero vector_.    these rules , used in the theory of symmetric functions @xcite are in fact nothing but a standard properties of slater determinants under action of second quantized operators .",
    "rule 1 results from the fact that @xmath34-th particle is excited to the level @xmath51 such that @xmath52 with the energy @xmath53 while the @xmath54-th particle is excited to the level @xmath55 and interchanging consecutive rows in a ( slater ) determinant results in a sign change .",
    "rule 2 results from the fact that @xmath56 implies @xmath57 which contradicts the pauli principle .",
    "rule 3 reflects the fact that negative @xmath32 describe ( forbidden ) transitions to occupied states inside the fermi sea .",
    "let us denote by @xmath58 the factors @xmath59 or @xmath60 acquired when bringing a partition @xmath35 to its standard form . in these notations",
    "the matrix element of the interactions between the partitions @xmath35 and @xmath61 can be represented as @xmath62 since the basis of slater determinants is orthonormal the following expression is obtained @xmath63 the eigenstates of @xmath48 are @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the characters of the irreducible representation @xmath35 of an element of the symmetric group @xmath66 belonging to the class @xmath67 . for this purpose",
    "it is shown in appendix a that @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of times the cycle @xmath70 appears in the class @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to @xmath71 the state @xmath72 is therefore an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with the eigenvalue @xmath73 the orthogonality of the characters implies that the states @xmath72 form an orthogonal basis , namely : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of elements in @xmath66 and the number of elements in the class @xmath67 is @xmath76 we normalize the states @xmath72 as @xmath77 so that they form an orthonormal basis .",
    "these are standard bosonic states usually labeled by the occupation numbers @xmath69 that are the eigenstates of the interacting hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the transformation with the matrix @xmath78 is the unitary transformation of the basis vectors in our hilbert space , which diagonalizes the interacting hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . when the free part of the hamiltonian is degenerate in the subspace @xmath14 the states @xmath72 play the role of the extended states ( in the hilbert space ) . in order to verify this statement we calculated numerically the inverse participation ratio @xmath79 , defined as @xmath80 for some arbitrary states @xmath67 .",
    "although no closed expression is available for the general amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) of the state @xmath81 on the site @xmath35 , the beautiful recurrent relation of the characters of the symmetric group ( [ recurrence ] ) ( based on the frobenius formula ) was implemented numerically to calculate these amplitudes .",
    "the inverse participation ratio averaged over the bosonic states @xmath67 is shown in fig .",
    "[ invp ] for different values of @xmath14 . as the number of sites @xmath82 increases the inverse participation ratio @xmath79",
    "was found to decay as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the bosonic states @xmath67 are indeed extended in the basis of free slater determinants @xmath35 .",
    "the existence of extended states in the chiral tomonaga - luttinger model can be attributed to the degeneracy of the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , since the interactions ( [ int2 ] ) have short - range in the space of partitions . in order to define more precisely what we mean by short - range in our hilbert space we have to order the partitions in some order .",
    "then the interaction can be shown to connect only blocks of elements that are not too far one from the other .",
    "it is natural to order the partitions in the lexicographic order , i.e. if @xmath85 numbers the letters in an alphabet the lexicographic order of partitions corresponds to the order of words in arabic or hebrew dictionary .",
    "for example , the 11 partitions of @xmath86 in the lexicographic order are : @xmath87 the partitions are grouped by @xmath88the number of 1 s ( that appear always on the right ) .",
    "the @xmath88-th group contains partitions of the form @xmath89 with constraint @xmath90 , with the only exception for the first group containing @xmath91 .",
    "the typical young diagram of a partition in the @xmath88-th group is of the form @xmath92 to calculate the number of partitions in the @xmath88-th group we note that exactly @xmath93 partitions have at least @xmath94 ones . among them",
    "@xmath95 have at least @xmath96 ones and the rest @xmath97 have _ exactly _ @xmath94 ones .",
    "therefore the @xmath88-th group contains @xmath98 partitions .",
    "usually the matrix element of the interaction potential @xmath99 is a decreasing function of the momentum transfer @xmath70 , with some effective range @xmath100 . in",
    "what follows it will be convenient to analyze a model where the only non - zero matrix element corresponds to @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "it will not affect qualitatively our results , since we are primarily interested in the limit of large @xmath14 subspace .",
    "the matrix element of this interaction is given by the simplified version of ( [ int2 ] ) @xmath103 the factors @xmath104 are omitted since the partitions @xmath105 and @xmath106 are either already in the standard ( non - increasing ) form or corresponds to zero vector and do not contribute to the sum .",
    "therefore the interaction couples partitions @xmath35 and @xmath61 that differ in two of the @xmath32 s , namely @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the young diagram of the partition @xmath35 is obtained from the one of the partition @xmath61 by moving one square under the constraint that the new young diagram is legitimate .",
    "consider the @xmath88-th group . if @xmath109 and @xmath110 the coupling is between partitions inside this group .",
    "this corresponds to moving a square between @xmath109 rows of the young diagram .",
    "in order to couple to neighboring groups a square corresponding to @xmath111 should be moved . moving a square from / to any row with @xmath112 to / from the region where @xmath111 leads to a coupling to the neighboring group @xmath113 .",
    "the exception is if a square is moved from @xmath114 ( that has only two squares and after the move only one is left ) and is attached as the last square in the tail of @xmath115 , or if the last square is moved to @xmath115 turning it into a @xmath116 row . in this case",
    "the length of the tail of @xmath115 is changed by two , i.e. the coupling is to the group @xmath117 .",
    "these are the only moves of one square , therefore only the groups @xmath118 such that @xmath119 are coupled to the @xmath88-th group and the interaction between the various blocks of partitions is of short range .",
    "[ matrix ] shows the structure of the interaction matrix for @xmath120 .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the diagonal disorder will destroy the extended states of the chiral tomonaga - luttinger model . in the original model in the absence of interactions",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath121 are independent of the partition and take the constant value @xmath122 .",
    "we introduce a modification and assume that the @xmath121 are independent random variables .",
    "this assumption is made for the sake of simplicity .",
    "it can not be correct since there are @xmath45 values of @xmath121 that depend on @xmath123 level spacings .",
    "an assumption that is more physical will be introduced in the following section .    in order to be able to solve the model with random energies we simplify further the interaction ( [ int3 ] ) . from the experience in research of anderson localization",
    "we expect that the behavior of the eigenvectors will not be affected by the precise form of the short - range off - diagonal matrix elements , so we make the following simplifications .",
    "we assume that the effect of transitions inside the same group of partitions is to delocalize the states within the group .",
    "the localization within a group is expected only to enhance the overall localization .",
    "next , we neglect the coupling to the @xmath124-th group .",
    "the reason is that for a given partition @xmath35 there exists only one coupling term of this kind .",
    "it couples @xmath125 this should be compared it with the couplings of @xmath35 to the next group : @xmath126 the number of such couplings is given by the number of different @xmath127 in the partition @xmath35 , which is generally much larger than 1 for large enough @xmath88 .",
    "it is equal to the number of rows with @xmath128 in the young diagram of the partition .",
    "consider for example the partition @xmath129 of @xmath130 belonging to he the 17-th group corresponding to the young diagram ( [ example ] ) .",
    "it has ( apart of ones ) three different parts : 6,4,3 and is coupled to 3 partitions in the 18-th group : @xmath131 another way to visualize the number of coupling is to count the number of concave corners in the young diagram that is equal to the number of parts namely lines of different length larger than unity .    in appendix",
    "b we show that @xmath132  the number of different parts in all partitions of @xmath88 with @xmath127 is exactly @xmath133  the number of ( any ) partitions of @xmath134 .",
    "therefore the mean number of transitions from the @xmath88-th group to the @xmath135-th group is given by @xmath136 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for our simplified model can be written as a tight - binding form where the groups of partitions are the effective sites : @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the value of the wave function on site@xmath35 in the @xmath88-th group .",
    "let us assume that the wave function is extended within the @xmath88th group .",
    "we introduce a simpler model that is expected to exhibit similar localization properties @xcite .",
    "we replace the interaction @xmath139 by an average interaction that couples each partition in the @xmath88-th group to all partitions in the group @xmath113 , @xmath140 in this approximation ( [ schr1 ] ) reduces to @xmath141 the numerator in ( [ effint1 ] ) can be estimated as @xmath2 times the mean number of couplings with partitions in @xmath142-th group : @xmath143    denoting the sum of the wave - functions over a group by @xmath144 we find with the help of ( [ schr2 ] ) that @xmath145 where @xmath146 and the sum is over all partitions in the group @xmath88 .    for random independent @xmath121",
    "all the @xmath147 are independent random variables and the tight - binding model ( [ effschr ] ) is an anderson model at zero energy . in the spirit of transfer matrix method",
    "it is expected that also for @xmath147 given by ( [ ek ] ) similar localization properties will be found .",
    "the properties of the solution of this one - dimensional model can be analyzed within the framework of anderson localization in one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "one can take the uniform distribution of energies that turns out to be convenient for calculations . remembering that each many - body energy is a sum of @xmath14 level spacings we assume the following distribution : @xmath148    for a variety of distributions the distribution of @xmath147 tends to the cauchy distribution : @xmath149 where @xmath150 and for ( [ pe ] ) @xmath151",

    "we observe that the distribution parameter depends weakly on the site number @xmath88 and use the site - dependent localization length ansatz : @xmath159 the last approximation is justified in the weak - coupling limit @xmath160 .",
    "the validity of the site - dependent localization length assumption is checked numerically .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath147 were generated from the cauchy distribution ( [ cauchy ] ) with parameter @xmath161 given by ( [ deltaklim ] ) .",
    "the inverse localization length @xmath162 ( lyapunov exponent ) was calculated using the standard technique of transfer matrices @xcite and it was found that the site - dependent ansatz ( [ locl ] ) describes well ( at least qualitatively ) the behavior of the localization length .",
    "thus for independently distributed energies the typical behavior of the wave functions is described by coefficients that decay as @xmath163 in the strong coupling limit similar considerations lead to @xmath164 but in this limit these require some further justification .",
    "the importance of this result is that numerical studies of more realistic many - particle energy distributions confirm the validity of ( [ coeffk ] )",
    ". this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "in the last section we considered a model in which the diagonal matrix elements @xmath121 are independent random variables .",
    "we did not specify the distribution law of these energies , since the solution does not depend on fine details , but rather on general properties of the distribution .",
    "we would like to stress that the assumption of statistical independence of the energies @xmath121 is not realistic for a many - body system . to illustrate this statement a simple argument can be given .",
    "suppose we are dealing with a disordered mesoscopic system and the one - particle spectrum is random , i.e. consists of levels with independently distributed spacings @xmath165 .",
    "the generalization of the expression ( [ epart ] ) for the energy of the partition @xmath35 for this case is @xmath166 in order to describe the energies @xmath121 in the subspace @xmath14 we need @xmath123 random quantities @xmath167 . on the other hand",
    "the number of states in this subspace is given by @xmath45 , the number of partitions of @xmath14 which grows exponentially for @xmath168 .",
    "therefore there exist much more many - body energies @xmath121 than independent level spacings",
    ". therefore the many - particle energies @xmath121 , which are the sums of the one - particle energies , are statistically dependent .",
    "the analytical calculation of the ( joint ) distribution of the parameters @xmath147 defined in ( [ ek ] ) for the effective tight - binding model ( [ effschr ] ) seems to be hopeless .",
    "nevertheless we expect some features of this distribution , based on the formula ( [ ek ] ) . for an eigenstate",

    "the value of @xmath169 can be very close one of the @xmath121 .",
    "therefore the terms in the sum on the rhs of ( [ ek ] ) can be positive or negative and they strongly fluctuate in magnitude .",
    "therefore there is a finite probability that this sum will take a value in the vicinity of zero .",
    "consequently it is expected that the distribution @xmath173 is broad with a diverging second moment or variance : @xmath174    another important issue is the effective statistical independence of @xmath147 for different @xmath88-s .",
    "it is known for anderson localization that the long - range correlations between the on - site energies change dramatically the criteria for the onset of the localization ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the measure of statistical dependence of energies in our case is the correlation matrix defined as @xmath175 because of the strong fluctuations between the terms of the sum on the rhs of ( [ ek ] ) , that are different for the various groups , it is reasonable that the off - diagonal terms of the correlation function are much smaller than the diagonal ones .",
    "usually for localization only pair correlations are important @xcite .",
    "in the view of the diverging variance we assume that @xmath176 , an assumption that will be tested numerically .",

    "it is plausible that the correlations are of short range in the space of indices @xmath88 and only the diagonal elements of @xmath185 are of appreciable magnitude .",

    "the scaling of the distribution implies that the characteristic function ( [ character ] ) satisfies @xmath192 which is easy to check by plotting @xmath193 as a function of @xmath194 for different values of @xmath88 .",
    "these curves are displayed in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] and are indeed found to be close to each other in spite of the fact that @xmath98 ranges from @xmath195 to @xmath196 .",
    "we found numerically that the universal characteristic function can be well approximated by the general form @xmath197 the value of parameters were found to be @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "this is the characteristic function of a distribution of a sum of two random variables @xmath200 and @xmath201 , where @xmath200 is drawn from cauchy distribution with probability density @xmath202 and the second is distributed normally according to @xmath203 the distribution of @xmath204 is thus given by @xmath205 and its characteristic function is ( [ formx ] ) .",
    "it has a diverging variance due to the fact that @xmath206 behaves as @xmath207 for large @xmath208 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath209 and the limiting behavior of the distribution function are the same as those found in the case of mutually independent energies .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the behavior of the coefficients @xmath210 given by ( [ coeffk ] ) , that was obtained in the model with uncorrelated @xmath121 , is satisfied also by the eigenfunctions of the more realistic model of the present section .",
    "the localization properties of the eigenstates of the modified interacting chiral tomonaga - luttinger model were studied . for total energy @xmath15 subspace we defined an effective lattice of slater determinants labeled by partitions of @xmath14 which represent the eigenstates of the system in the absence of interactions . we have observed that in the case of linear dispersion the eigenstates of the interacting model described by the bosons are extended over this lattice . when the random one - particle levels are introduced instead of the equidistant spectrum , the bosons are no more the eigenstates and the problem of diagonalizing of the hamiltonian . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we have grouped the different sites ( partitions ) according to the number of ones , representing the distance of the most excited particle from the fermi surface in the original slater determinant .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the grouping of many - body states into generations according to the number of excited particles and holes as was firstly done in @xcite .",
    "each resulting group of partitions was given a label @xmath88 .",
    "the interactions were shown to be of short range in @xmath88 .",
    "the interactions were further simplified by assuming that they interconnect only groups of partitions corresponding to the adjacent values of the index @xmath88 ( and the interactions between groups @xmath88 and @xmath117 were neglected ) .",
    "assuming further that the states are extended within each group @xmath88 we obtained an effective tight - binding anderson model where each group @xmath88 has an effective random energy and the hopping takes place between the nearest neighbors only . in the assumption of independently distributed on -",
    "site energies the model is found to be close to the lloyd model characterized by a broad distribution of the on - site energies .",
    "the main feature of our effective model is that the distribution of energies is @xmath88-dependent .",
    "we employed the site - dependent localization length assumption , which consists in assuming the parameters of distribution change slowly , so locally the localization length is given by the same formula as for the lloyd model with parameters of the local distribution instead of the uniform global one . up to an unknown numerical factor",
    "this solution describes well the behavior of the localization length as a function of @xmath88 and it enabled us to show that the eigenstates are localized in the space of groups of partitions , @xmath88 .",
    "the weak - coupling and the strong - coupling regimes can be identified according to the value of the parameter @xmath211 . in the weak - coupling regime @xmath212 , the amplitudes decay as @xmath213 , namely nearly exponentially . in the strong coupling regime @xmath214 ,",
    "this behavior changes to @xmath215 .",
    "one important point which was discussed is the effect of correlations between the many - body energies of the non - interacting system . in the studies devoted to the localization in many - body systems",
    "the effective on - site energies corresponding to the eigenstates of the non - interacting system are assumed to be independent random variables , so their spectrum is described by a poissonian sequence .",
    "this is not the case for the true many - body fermionic system , since these energies are sums of independent energies of one - particle excitations .",
    "the number of independent random variables is therefore much less than the number of different many - body states .",
    "this situation is similar in some sense to one faced in random walk problems , where the increments are distributed independently , while there is a strong correlation between the positions of the random walk at different times . in our work",
    "we considered this problem numerically and found that although the correlation between the exact energies corresponding to the eigenstates of the free model are not _ a priori _ negligible the random energies of the effective sites @xmath88 are found to be very weakly correlated .",
    "moreover it was found that the parameters of the distribution of the effective energy of the group @xmath88 scale with the number of the partitions inside the group in the same way as they do in the case of independent many - body energies .",
    "this led us to the conclusion that our result for the localization of the eigenstates are valid for more realistic assumptions on the distribution of the many - body energies .",
    "the main open problem arising from the present discussion is the study of the interacting electrons in dimensions higher than one by the methods of high - dimensional bosonization . in this technique",
    "@xcite the fermionic system is described as an infinite set of one - dimensional luttinger models attached to a point on the fermi surface .",
    "therefore the interactions mix the states belonging to different points in addition to the coupling within the same point ( represented by a luttinger model ) , which can be treated within the framework developed in the present paper .",
    "this possibly can be a mechanism for the delocalization of the states and a resulting localization transition must be compared with the transition encountered in the recent studies @xcite of interacting electrons in finite systems .",
    "another question to be explored in the future is the nature of localization in the hilbert space for single - particle dispersions that are more realistic than the random ones .",
    "the authors would like to thank alex kamenev for useful remarks and eric akkermans for stimulating discussions in the initial stages of the project .",
    "this research was supported in part by the u.s.israel binational science foundation ( bsf ) , by the minerva center for non - linear physics of complex systems , by the israel science foundation , by the niedersachsen ministry of science ( germany ) and by the fund for promotion of research at the technion .",
    "in this appendix we show that the property ( [ theproperty ] ) @xmath216 is satisfied for the characters of the symmetric group @xmath66 .",
    "we did not find this property in any textbook on the representations of groups , but its validity follows from the known properties of the characters of @xmath66 found , for example , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present the proof of this property here for the sake of completeness of the discussion .",
    "the frobenius formula as it is written in the classic textbooks on group theory @xcite states the following identity between two antisymmetric functions of @xmath14-dimensional vector @xmath217 : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the character of the class @xmath67 of the symmetric group @xmath66 in the irreducible representation @xmath35 . with the partition @xmath35 one associates the totally antisymmetric function : @xmath220 where the sum runs over all the permutations of @xmath221 , the sign of permutation being @xmath222 for an even / odd permutation .",
    "this is , up to a normalization constant , a slater determinant constructed out of one - particle wave - functions @xmath223 , where @xmath224 .",
    "the factor @xmath225 in ( [ thefrobenius ] ) is the vandermonde determinant : @xmath226 representing the ground state of @xmath14 fermions .",
    "let @xmath227 be a power sum of variables @xmath228 defined as follows : @xmath229 the function @xmath230 is totally symmetric function of the @xmath228-s .",
    "these functions are linearly independent as can be checked by calculating the jacobian : @xmath231 the class @xmath67 is characterized by @xmath232 cycles of length @xmath233 . for this class",
    "the totally symmetric function @xmath234 is defined as a product of power sums @xmath235 since for different @xmath70-s the power sums @xmath236 are linearly independent so are the monomials @xmath234 for different partitions @xmath67 .    the frobenius formula ( [ thefrobenius ] ) can be inverted with help of the orthogonality relation of the characters : @xmath237 where @xmath75 is the order of the @xmath66 and @xmath238 is the number of elements of @xmath66 in the class @xmath67 given by ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "we turn now to develop a recurrence relation between the characters . for this purpose",
    "it is instructive to consider the product of the antisymmetric function @xmath239 and a power sum @xmath230 .",
    "since the power sum is totally symmetric the summands can be rearranged in the order set by each permutation and one obtains @xmath240 where @xmath241 or @xmath60 is determined accordingly to the rules of section 2 .",
    "having established the relation between the slater determinants @xmath242 for various partitions we turn to develop a recurrence relation between the characters .",
    "consider class @xmath67 with at least one @xmath70-cycle .",
    "let us denote by @xmath243 the class obtained by removing one @xmath70-cycle from @xmath67 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath244 the partition @xmath243 defines a class in the symmetry group @xmath245 . the frobenius formula ( [ thefrobenius ] ) for this class reads @xmath246 while for @xmath67 it can be rewritten with the help of ( [ thefact ] ) in the form @xmath247 comparing the coefficients of the @xmath248 in ( [ theform ] ) with those in ( [ thefrobenius ] ) we find the recurrence relation of the characters @xmath249 this relation yields the characters of @xmath66 in terms of the characters of the symmetric group @xmath245 .    in order to derive ( [ theproperty ] ) take some particular @xmath70 and let each partition @xmath67 contain @xmath70 as its part @xmath250 times . for each @xmath35 consider the following sum over partitions : @xmath251",
    "if @xmath67 has no parts equal to @xmath70 , @xmath252 and @xmath67 does not contribute to this sum .",
    "we want to factor out @xmath253 from the sum and for this purpose we can write @xmath254 , so that the sum is over @xmath243 . with the help of ( [ gl ] )",
    "we see that the expansion coefficients satisfy @xmath255 where @xmath256 .",

    "in this appendix we show that @xmath262  the number of distinct parts in the partitions of @xmath14 with parts @xmath128 equals @xmath263  the number of unrestricted partitions of @xmath264 .",
