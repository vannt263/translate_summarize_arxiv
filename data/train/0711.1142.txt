    "the most recent major outburst of the symbiotic star and recurrent nova rs ophiuchi ( ) was discovered near the optical peak on 2006 february 12.83 @xcite , hereafter taken as time zero .",
    "rs oph is a binary system in which a red giant deposits material through its wind onto a white dwarf ( wd ) companion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "approximately every 20 years , the system erupts as a nova , as runaway thermonuclear burning in the hydrogen - rich white - dwarf envelope leads to a visual brightness increase of more than 6 mag in less than 2 days , a sustained period with wd luminosity near the eddington limit , and the ejection of material from the wd surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the last such eruption was in 1985 .",
    "the frequency of these outbursts suggests that the mass of the wd in rs oph is very close to the chandrasekhar limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making this a prime candidate for a type ia supernova progenitor system .",
    "whereas most novae detected in the radio emit via thermal free - free bremsstrahlung from the shell of ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , post - outburst radio emission from rs oph instead emanates primarily from the dense circumstellar material ( csm ) that is swept up and shocked by the fairly low - mass ejected shell .",
    "observations after the previous outburst in 1985 with the european very long baseline interferometry network ( evn ) , the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) , and the very large array ( vla ) suggested that the radio emission was initially non - thermal at low frequencies , with a possible thermal component becoming dominant later in the outburst .",
    "the radio source consisted of a resolved central component plus possible bi - polar jets expanding at 1.5 mas / day @xcite .",
    "although jets have been observed from an increasing number of accreting white dwarfs in symbiotic stars and supersoft x - ray sources @xcite , and even several novae @xcite , these jets are generally not spatially well resolved , and basic questions such as the relationship between jet production and outbursts remain .",
    "most jets from white dwarfs have velocities of hundreds to thousands of km s@xmath1 , and when jet emission can be spatially isolated , it usually appears to be thermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a few cases ,",
    "however , observations have hinted that particles can be accelerated sufficiently that non - thermal radio and/or x - ray emission can also be produced @xcite .",
    "here we report the detection of an expanding , synchrotron - emitting ring just weeks after the nova explosion , and , between three and four weeks after the outburst , the appearance of a synchrotron - emitting feature to the east of this ring aligned with the putative jet from 1985 .",
    "we describe our observations of the expanding ring and the eastern component in  2 .",
    "we discuss these observations in more detail in  3 , and summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "we observed rs oph with the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao s ) very long baseline array ( vlba ) under project code bs167 in two four - hour runs , on 2006 march 5 and 2006 march 11 , corresponding to days 20.8 and 26.8 of the outburst , respectively .",
    "the first run used all antennas but hancock , while the second used the entire 10-antenna array .",
    "we observed the source in two frequency bands , consisting of 64mhz in each of the two dual polarizations , centered on 1.6675 and 4.9875ghz , recorded at a rate of 256 megabits per second . to remove atmospheric and instrumental effects , we employed phase referencing using the nearby calibrators j1745@xmath20753 ( 167 away ; primary calibrator at 5.0ghz ) and j1743@xmath20305 ( 327 away ; primary calibrator at 1.7ghz ) .",
    "the position of the former was taken from the second vlba calibrator survey @xcite , with a quoted ( rms ) accuracy of 0.50milliarcseconds ; the position of the latter was taken from the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a quoted accuracy of 0.77milliarcseconds .",
    "we correlated all four polarization pairs using the vlba correlator in socorro , nm , and calibrated , imaged , and self - calibrated the data in the standard fashion using nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "phase referencing aligned the 5.0ghz images to better than 0.5mas .",
    "the 1.7ghz images differed by @xmath3mas , rather larger than expected from residual ionospheric effects , but not alarmingly so , given the poor weather during the first observations .",
    "we shifted the lower frequency images to align the centers of the rings with those seen at 5.0ghz .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows the total intensity images . to a limit of a few percent ( or the rms noise , whichever was higher )",
    ", no linear or circular polarization was detected in either epoch , at either frequency .",
    "there may be some missing radio emission on scales much larger than sampled by the vlba  the corrected 5ghz flux density on day 20.8 ( @xmath4 ;",
    "see below ) is somewhat lower than that seen by merlin at 6ghz on the same day ( about @xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "all four images are dominated by a ring which is much brighter to the east than to the west . despite this brightness asymmetry ,",
    "the ring is consistent with being circular ( fig.[fig : rings ] ) . in particular , a two - dimensional ring with an inclination corresponding to that of the binary orbit ( @xmath6 :",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a significantly worse fit than a face - on ring or sphere .",
    "these results are based on simulated vlba observations of circular and elliptical rings of various thicknesses and axis ratios , with brightness distributions around the ring similar to that observed .",
    "these simulations take account of such important interferometric uncertainties as the effects of limited uv - coverage and non - linear processing , including deconvolution in particular .",
    "the ring center ( as measured at 5ghz on both days ) at ( j2000 ) is : @xmath7 with an uncertainty of at most one milliarcsecond ( mas ) .",
    "we checked for systematic errors in our astrometry by phase referencing our secondary calibrator ( j1743@xmath20350 ) to our primary calibrator ( j1745@xmath20753 ) at 5ghz .",
    "the resulting position agreed with that given in the icrf to 0.4mas in right ascension and 0.6mas in declination ",
    "well within the @xmath8 error bars reported in the icrf .",
    "since these calibrators are @xmath9 apart , while rsoph is separated from the primary calibrator by only @xmath10 , systematic errors are far below other uncertainties in the measurement .",
    "our vlbi position for rsoph is however @xmath11mas from the optical position from the naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( nomad ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "this optical position corrects for proper motion to the epoch 2006.19 , and is shown as a cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for the radio / optical offset .",
    "the width of the ring is barely resolved in the first epoch , and clearly resolved in the second , suggesting a growing thickness with time .",
    "we fit the observed ring as a circle with an asymmetric brightness distribution , thickened by convolution with a symmetric gaussian , and then convolved with the beam ( point spread function ) .",
    "the full - widths - at - half - maxima ( fwhms ) for the smoothing gaussians were @xmath14 on the first day , and @xmath15 on the second .",
    "the corresponding radii were @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these radii refer to the mid - points of the annuli ; the outermost parts of the rings ( mid - point + fwhm , from the fits ) are at @xmath18 and @xmath19mas .",
    "the error bars quoted here are more nearly @xmath20 than @xmath8 errors , insofar as this has meaning for non - gaussian error distributions , and the difference in widths is thus likely to be real .",
    "the asymmetry of the ring is much more pronounced at 5ghz than at 1.7ghz .",
    "this difference is not an instrumental effect : simulating 5ghz observations of the 1.7ghz model shows that the 5ghz observations would have shown the western emission clearly , had it been as ( relatively ) strong as at 1.7ghz .",
    "thus the spectrum of the eastern part of the ring is _ intrinsically _ relatively flat , while that of the western part falls sharply with frequency .",
    "based on the simulations , we multiplied the observed flux density at 5ghz by a factor 1.07 on day 20.8 , and 1.10 on day 26.8 , as a first - order correction for the differing uv - coverage between 5 and 1.7ghz . and",
    "[ fig : rings ] do _ not _ reflect this correction , as it is very likely to vary with position . ] the resulting flux densities at 1.7 and 5ghz are given in table  [ tab : spind ] .",
    "our second set of observations revealed an additional component @xmath21 to the east of the center of the ring .",
    "this new eastern component was present at both 1.7 and 5.0ghz .",
    "the 1.7ghz emission at this location is clearly resolved in the north / south direction , with a gaussian fit yielding a rough deconvolved size of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 at 2.45kpc [ see  [ sec : distance ] for a derivation of the distance ] ) . as with the ring",
    ", we simulated 5.0ghz observations of the 1.7ghz model , and found that , while the eastern component would appear much smaller at 5.0ghz ( as observed ) , the source spectrum must be intrinsically quite steep ( see table  [ tab : spind ] ) .",
    "this component was not seen in our first set of observations .",
    "the 1.7ghz map shows no source to the east of the ring : the @xmath24 flux density upper limit is @xmath25 , compared to the peak flux density on march 11 of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath20 5ghz upper limit is approximately @xmath27 .",
    "further vlba observations on 2006 mar 18 through 29 clearly detect the eastern component ; we postpone discussion of those data to a future paper .",
    "the expanding ring is most naturally associated with the shock wave resulting from the outburst , and seen in the strong early x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and broad optical , infrared , and x - ray lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those data suggest substantial deceleration , as expected for a shock sweeping up more and more of the red giant s stellar wind .",
    "figure[fig : exp ] compares the radius thus predicted from the optical , ir , and x - ray velocities with that observed in the radio .",
    "the solid circles represent outer radius estimates from the current data , derived through simulations of thick , asymmetric rings as discussed in  [ obs : expring ] .",
    "the open triangles represent the radii of @xcite , measured as half the maximum distance between peaks in a series of north - south slices .",
    "the nominal error bars of @xcite are 0.2mas , but , as they point out , these nominal errors almost certainly underestimate the true ones , and we plot 1mas error bars in the figure .",
    "the systematic difference between obrien et al.s measurements and ours , with the former lying some 20%  low , is likely due to the differences in fitting procedures , combined with an evolving surface brightness distribution and changing angular resolution ( cf .",
    " 5.6 of * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , the overall trend of radio radius with time , as measured by either group , matches the x - ray / optical / infrared predictions nicely .",
    "the agreement between the size of the radio ring and the expected location of the blastwave also support the conclusion that , unlike the ir continuum emission , which primarily emanates from a region within a few mas of the central binary @xcite , the radio emission is associated with the expanding shock . as shown in fig.[fig : rings ] , the ring is basically circular .",
    "this geometry is consistent with a spherical shock projected onto the plane of the sky ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar observations of supernova 1993j ) or a two - dimensional shock in the plane of the sky .",
    "there is no evidence in the ring shape either for an asymmetric explosion or for any special geometry of the circumstellar material . in particular , we see no sign that the ring is inclined either parallel or perpendicular to the binary orbit ( @xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fractional width of the ring ( thickness divided by radius ) increases from @xmath28 on day 20.8 , to @xmath29 on day 26.8 ( @xmath30 error bars ) .",
    "this breadth suggests that the emission arises in the forward rather than the reverse shock , since the latter is expected to be much thinner .",
    "the _ change _ in relative width shows that the evolution is _ not _ scale - free , thus ruling out a common theoretical simplification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "comparing the angular size observed by vlbi with the radius inferred from optical , x - ray , and infrared observations gives a direct estimate of the distance to the remnant .",
    "three estimates of the evolving shock veocity are currently available .",
    "first , the earliest optical spectra give initial velocities of @xmath31 ( based on * ? ? ?",
    "* and early spectra reported on vsnet ) , which we take as constant between the explosion ( assumed to occur on feb.@xmath32 , or @xmath33 days with respect to @xmath34 , the time of optical maximum [ feb.12.83 ] ) and @xmath35days .",
    "second , shock velocities may be derived from the observed x - ray temperatures , using the standard strong shock approximation and assuming the standard mean molecular weight ( @xmath36 ) for a fully ionized plasma .",
    "the x - ray emission is clearly complex , with indications of multiple temperatures and densities present at any given time .",
    "here we are interested in the highest temperature gas , corresponding to the material heated by the decelerating shock shown in the radio images , and adopt single - temperature fits to the highest energy x - rays seen in a given observation .",
    "the x - ray temperatures at early times , when the temperatures are highest , are best determined by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which responds most efficiently to higher - energy photons ; at late times , as the shock slows and the corresponding temperature decreases , the relatively soft response of _ swift _ provides the more relevant spectral coverage @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the measurements of @xcite before day 14.5 , and those of @xcite after day 13.5 .",
    "the x - ray velocities are well fit by two independent power laws , as detailed in table[tab : radfits ] and shown by the dashed lines in fig.[fig : xraytemp ] .",
    "the third and final set of velocity estimates comes from infrared spectroscopy . @xcite",
    "measured the ( deconvolved ) full - widths at half maxima ( fwhms ) and half - widths at zero intensity ( hwzis ) of the observed line profiles of two infrared lines ,  and pa@xmath37 , from 1.16 to 47.04 days after the explosion . while the measurements for the two lines are in rough agreement , and the fwhms agree with the optical and x - ray velocities discussed above , the fwhms for both lines  and the velocities inferred from the optical and x - ray data  are systematically low ( by a factor @xmath38 ) compared with the fwzi .",
    "this discrepancy was also noted by @xcite .",
    "2 of that paper shows that the difference between fwhm and hwzi results from the shape of the line profile : a strong , narrow , roughly gaussian peak , surrounded by a faint , broad plateau .",
    "the narrow component suggests an expanding wind or outflow , while the broad plateau is more characteristic of a thin shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the consistent ratio of the fwhms and hwzis , and the roughly constant ratio of the peak flux density in the two components , shows they remain closely associated for at least the first 40 days after the explosion .",
    "the early optical reports may well have missed a faint , broad line component .",
    "the much lower velocities derived from the x - ray temperatures , and their agreement with the fwhm of the narrow component of the infrared lines , is more puzzling .",
    "@xcite suggest that cosmic ray acceleration at the blast wave may explain both the velocity discrepancy and the relatively rapid deceleration of the shock .    here",
    "we assume the broad component of the infrared lines represents the shock velocity , as both the line shape and the extreme velocity suggest a thin , rapidly expanding shell .",
    "the scatter in the infrared measurements from day to day suggests some short - lived physical effects , or some uncertainty in the determinations of the line widths .",
    "we therefore multiply the smooth fit to the x - ray and optical velocities ( see above ) by 1.7 , to give a smooth curve which roughly reproduces the decline in the infrared hwzi . with these assumptions ,",
    "the errors on the shock radii at the times of our vlba observations are dominated by the error on the time of the explosion .    comparing these radii to the angular sizes corresponding to",
    "the outer part of the shock ( @xmath39mas at @xmath40 20.8days ; @xmath41mas for @xmath40 26.8days ) gives two fairly independent measurements of the distance : @xmath42 where the error bars are statistical , and dominated by the uncertainties in @xmath43 . taking the weighted average of these two distances gives a distance of @xmath44kpc .",
    "the major uncertainty in this estimate lies in the relation between the sizes measured with vlbi , and the velocities inferred from other wavelengths .",
    "first , if the ring is a two - dimensional structure inclined at an angle @xmath45 to the line - of - sight , that will increase the quoted distances by @xmath46 : a factor 1.6 for @xmath47 .",
    "given the observed circularity of the ring , this is likely to be a @xmath48 effect .",
    "second , we have assumed that the infrared velocities reflect those of the leading edge of the radio emission . adding an additional 10% ( rms ) systematic uncertainty based on the possibility that the outer edge of the observed radio shock lies within the high - velocity region traced by the extreme infrared velocities ,",
    "the final distance estimate is then @xmath49kpc , where the first error bars refers to the random and the second to the systematic errors .",
    "previous distance estimates are summarized by @xcite ; see also barry et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "these were based on spectral luminosity determinations , the presence or absence of absorption features at known distances , and a very rough relation between the distance and ( cold ) column density ( see primarily * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite concluded that the distance was likely to be around @xmath50kpc .",
    "our more direct estimate is higher but not enormously so .",
    "further , since a significant inclination for the ring can only _ increase _ our distance estimate , the comparison implies again that the ring is nearly face - on .",
    "given the close agreement between the blast wave velocity evolution inferred from x - ray , optical , and infrared observations and the expansion of the radio ring , it seems worth checking whether a significant fraction of the radio flux density could be thermal bremsstrahlung from the x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "fits to the data of @xcite ( table[tab : radfits ] ) give the temperature of the post - shock gas as @xmath51 on day 20.8 and @xmath52 on day 26.8 .",
    "these plasma temperatures are close to the observed peak surface brightness , which corresponds to an optically - thick black body of a few times @xmath53 .",
    "however , a mass of more than @xmath54 would be required to make the thermal gas optically thick in the radio , and the corresponding thermal energy would be more than @xmath55  an order of magnitude above the total energy of the outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  with a correspondingly high x - ray luminosity .",
    "clumping of higher - temperature gas would reduce the required mass somewhat , but not enough to remove these difficulties .",
    "thermal emission is thus unlikely to play a major role in the few - ghz radio flux at this stage of the outburst .",
    "the obvious alternative is synchrotron emission , which can easily explain the observed high surface brightness .",
    "optically - thin synchrotron spectra generally range from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , providing a natural explanation for the @xmath58 spectrum of the western side of the ring .",
    "the eastern part of the ring , with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) on day 20.8 and @xmath61 on day 26.8 , is more puzzling .",
    "foreground absorption in a @xmath62 medium would be expected to change rapidly over this time period , while the observed spectrum is fairly constant .",
    "also , whereas any foreground absorption ( or synchrotron self - absorption ) should have caused the flux density to decrease with decreasing frequency below 1.7ghz , in fact the 0.61ghz flux density of @xmath63mjy on day 20.3 @xcite was higher than the 1.7ghz flux density of @xmath64mjy that we measured from the eastern part of the ring on day 20.8 .",
    "either the eastern side of the ring contains a complicated mix of emission and absorption , or the spectrum reflects a very unusual energy distribution of relativistic particles .    assuming the emission is synchrotron  a conclusion shared by @xcite  standard equipartition arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest minimum energies in relativistic particles and fields of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ratio of the energy in protons to that in electrons ; @xmath67 is observed locally , while @xmath68 is predicted for strong shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the equipartition magnetic field at the location of the peak flux density in the ring is of order @xmath69 , comparable to previous results based on much lower quality data @xcite .",
    "the corresponding magnetic pressure is @xmath70dyn@xmath71 .",
    "as expected , these values are well below the total energy and pressure in the shock front .",
    "the steep spectral index ( @xmath72 ) and high surface brightness ( @xmath73 at 1.7ghz ) of the eastern component indicate that the emission must be primarily synchrotron .",
    "the minimum ( equipartition ) energy is then @xmath74 , a factor 10 below that in the ring , while the corresponding equipartition magnetic field is comparable , @xmath75 .",
    "if this component was ejected from the source at the core of the expanding ring , it is moving quite rapidly .",
    "presumably it was ejected during or after the initial outburst , and is thus at most 27days old when first detected by us ( 2006 mar 11 ) . at a distance of @xmath21 from the center of the ring ,",
    "its projected velocity is @xmath76 , which corresponds to @xmath77 ( where @xmath45 is the inclination to the line - of - sight , and taking a distance of 2.45kpc ) . for an inclination @xmath78",
    ", the velocity of the eastern component is @xmath79 . for comparison ,",
    "the escape speed from a white dwarf is @xmath80 @xcite , or @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "based on the contour plot of @xcite , the evn detection on day 21.5 gives roughly the same speed .",
    "the eastern component had thus not decelerated significantly before day 27 .",
    "@xcite present a preliminary view of vlba , evn , and merlin observations of rsoph in 2006 , with the vlbi data covering days 13.828.7 .",
    "most aspects of our images agree reasonably well with their results .",
    "however , they detect the eastern component quite strongly ( peak @xmath83 ) at 5ghz with the evn on day 21.5 , while we do _ not _ see that component with the vlba on day 20.8 .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is likely due to the more centrally concentrated uv - coverage of the evn observations , which are correspondingly more sensitive to faint , extended emission .",
    "the eastern component was therefore already extended by day 20.8 , as we directly observe on day 26.8 .",
    "further , our detection of the component at 5ghz with the same instrument and observing time on day 26.8 as our non - detection on day 20.8 shows that the eastern component was still brightening during this time .",
    "our 1.7ghz vlba observations on day 20.8 do not show the eastern component .",
    "this result agrees with the non - detection of obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) at the same frequency on day 20.5 . since the vlba is much more sensitive to extended structures at this lower frequency than at 5 ghz ( the angular response scales as @xmath84 , with @xmath85 the wavelength , and @xmath86 the length of the baseline under consideration ) , our non - detection at 1.7ghz places strong constraints on the spectrum around day 21 .",
    "had the spectrum on day 21 been as steep as the spectrum we observed on day 27 , we would have measured a 1.7ghz flux density of @xmath87mjy , or @xmath88 in our vlba observations .",
    "considering instead the @xmath24 upper limit of @xmath89mjy / beam at 1.7ghz , and comparing this limit to the evn detection , we find that on day 21 , the radio spectrum was actually either flat or inverted ( rising towards higher frequencies ) .",
    "the eastern - component spectrum therefore evolved significantly between day 21 and day 27 .",
    "the spectral and flux density evolution , combined with the inferred large extent of the eastern component , suggest that external ( free - free ) absorption is important , as expected for a source embedded in a dense , ionized red giant wind .",
    "the primary challenge lies in explaining the initial obscuration of the eastern component at a time when the ring is clearly visible . @xcite",
    "invoke a special geometry to explain the visibility of the ring , as well as the late turn - on of the eastern component and the lack of any corresponding western feature during the first month . in their picture , the obscuring medium is the circumstellar material ( assumed spherically symmetric ) shed by the red giant companion .",
    "they assume the radio emission comes from a bright , slowly expanding equatorial ring and a bipolar shock structure .",
    "they take the approaching ( eastern ) side of the bipolar jet to be inclined about @xmath90 to the line - of - sight , moving outward , and sweeping up absorbing material . in this picture ,",
    "the eastern component of the jet becomes visible when the shock overtakes most of the absorbing circumstellar material .",
    "the receding jet remains behind more of the red giant wind , so that ( western ) component is not expected to be seen until later",
    ". they suggest that the more distant ( eastern ) part of the ring is visible almost instantly because the jet has swept away the densest , high - obscuration part of the red giant wind along that line - of - sight .",
    "one can make this more quantitative by requiring that the free - free opacity @xmath91 due to the red giant wind be @xmath92 at the times and frequencies where the eastern component is not seen , and @xmath93 at the times and frequencies where it is .",
    "the opacity predicted for a fully ionized , spherically symmetric , @xmath62 wind are shown as a function of projected distance from the center in fig.[fig : abs ] , together with arrows showing the rough constraints from the 1.7 and 5ghz vlbi observations .",
    "this simple model works remarkably well . assuming one proton per electron and an electron temperature of @xmath94k , and taking the wind velocity @xmath95 , the inferred mass loss rate is @xmath96 for an inclination @xmath78 for the eastern component s velocity vector .",
    "this mass loss rate is quite reasonable , and within a factor of two of that derived by @xcite ( after correcting for the difference in the assumed distance ) based on shock models fit to the x - ray emission from the 1985 outburst .",
    "absorption can thus easily explain the late appearance of the eastern component ; but the central ring is more challenging . in the @xcite model , the observed ring should represent the projection of a highly - inclined , two - dimensional circle , i.e. , an ellipse .",
    "our data show that the ring in fact is quite circular ( fig.[fig : rings ] ) , making explanations involving strong deviations from spherical symmetry difficult to maintain .",
    "the flat spectrum of the eastern part of the ring is also not a natural result of the @xcite model .",
    "another possible explanation for the abrupt appearance of the eastern component is that it was intrinsically faint until around day 21 .",
    "the eastern component could represent a terminal shock of the kind associated with the ejecta of many active galactic nuclei , microquasars , and protostars ( in the form of herbig haro objects ) , although this explanation has some difficulties since for rs oph , the circum - binary density falls off rapidly with distance rather than abruptly increasing .",
    "the ejecta could also have brightened upon moving into the relative vacuum beyond the outer edge of the wind nebula . as in the current outburst ,",
    "the expanding shock in 1985 swept up the csm , leaving behind a relative vacuum . over the past 21 years",
    ", the red giant has been re - filling this vacuum with a wind moving out at @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the collimated ejecta would have reached the edge of this re - filled region in @xmath98 @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the velocity of the collimated outflow ) , around the same time that it brightened in the radio .",
    "if the red giant wind can carry outward and compress ( and hence strengthen ) the magnetic field at large radii , relativistic particles might produce copious synchrotron emission upon encountering the compressed field .",
    "alternatively , if the relativistic plasma was initially highly confined by the circumstellar gas ( and thus synchrotron self - absorbed ) , it might expand and become visible at lower radio frequencies upon reaching the edge of the confining medium . to match the observed azimuthal extent on day 21 .",
    "] one might then expect the eastern component to become relatively stationary at late times rather than continuing to move out rapidly .",
    "dual - frequency vlba observations made 20.8 and 26.8 days after the february 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs oph have shown that the bulk of the radio emission at this stage comes from an expanding synchrotron shell .",
    "the shell s increasing angular size matches the shock velocities inferred from x - ray observations and measured through infrared spectroscopy , confirming the basic picture of a decelerating shock between the material flung off in the explosion from the surface of the white dwarf and the circumstellar material produced by the wind of its red giant companion .",
    "this gives a direct distance estimate of @xmath101 , the most accurate yet determined for this source .",
    "this evolving shock is far from simple .",
    "the shell evolution is _ not _ self - similar , with the shell thickness increasing from @xmath102 to @xmath103 between the two epochs .",
    "in addition , the brightness distribution around the shell is highly asymmetric , with the eastern side many times brighter than the western side .",
    "the eastern side of the ring also has a much flatter radio spectrum .",
    "to our knowledge , such a spectrum has been seen only once before for a high - brightness resolved source , in the radio images of the expanding shell associated with the peculiar x - ray outburst of the emission - line star cicam @xcite .",
    "finally , the flux density of the western part of the shell is _ increasing _ with time , in contrast to the optically - thin behavior of the ejecta - driven shocks in physically similar systems such as supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our vlba images also reveal an additional eastern component that is well separated from the dominant ring .",
    "` jets ' ( generally just elongations or separate components in barely - resolved sources ) have been seen in previous outbursts of this and other symbiotic stars .",
    "the vlbi observations of rs oph constitute the first unambiguous evidence for a synchrotron jet emanating from a white dwarf system .",
    "the inferred speed is close to the escape speed from a high - mass white dwarf , in accord with the generally good agreement between directed outflow and escape speeds for physical systems ranging from low - mass protostars to black hole binaries and active galactic nuclei .",
    "similarly , synchrotron emission is characteristic of fast jets , where emission far from the powering source is generally assumed to derive from an interaction between the flow and the surrounding medium .",
    "the association of a highly directed and a quasi - spherical outflow is more unusual , but certainly not unprecedented ; for instance , the jet model for gamma - ray bursts , and their association with core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has brought the physical connection between quasi - spherical and highly directed outbursts into much greater prominence .    the eastern component that was so prominent on day 27 appeared to `` turn on '' around day 21 .",
    "although this turn - on could be due to decreasing absorption by the circumstellar medium as the eastern component moved outwards , there are several difficulties with this picture .",
    "intrinsic brightening , possibly associated with the component reaching the edge of the region re - filled by the red giant wind since the last nova outburst in 1985 , may also play a role in the turn - on .",
    "the preferred east - west axis for the observed asymmetries is consistent with vlbi observations on day 77 of the last ( 1985 ) outburst , which showed a strong east / west extension @xcite .",
    "the persistent east - west asymmetry suggests that this preferred axis reflects an intrinsic asymmetry in the binary system , rather than ( for instance ) some statistical irregularity in a particular explosive event .",
    "the binary orbit provides one possible source of the asymmetry . although a highly anisotropic density structure around the binary could collimate the outflow , with the ` jet ' naturally focused along the axis of least resistance ( cf .",
    "* ) , one would then expect the observed ring to correspond to the high - density ` waist ' of this structure .",
    "the ring is in fact circular in projection and brightest along the trajectory of the eastern component .",
    "whatever the collimation mechanism in rs oph , we may for the first time be seeing the formation of a white - dwarf jet , as well as the most compelling demonstration to date of both its high initial speed and the physical emission mechanism ( synchrotron emission ) .",
    "we are grateful to the vlba scheduling committee and the array operations staff for the efforts which made these observations possible . as with most research on bright variable stars ,",
    "this work has greatly benefited from the regular monitoring ( and quick reporting ) of both amateur and professional variable star observers , generally publicized through the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) and the variable star network ( vsnet ) .",
    "we are further grateful to the referee , mike bode , for a number of useful comments , as well as for organizing an exceptionally productive workshop on this source in the summer of 2007 .",
