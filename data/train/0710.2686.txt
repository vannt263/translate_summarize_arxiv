    "effects connected with the final size of the system are especially pronounced for small objects and they are encountered in many applications of the stochastic processes to systems of high complexity . taking into account the absorbing barriers is essential in dealing with several population and environmental problems .",
    "for example , models of species extinction involve the size of a refuge in which life conditions are favorable , whereas they are extremely harsh outside @xcite .",
    "inclusion of size of the refuge is also crucial in a model of the infection of hantavirus in the deer mouse , based on biological observations in north america @xcite .",
    "time characteristics of the escaping process involve the first passage time density distribution , defined as a probability that the time the particle needs to reach the absorbing boundary is within the interval @xmath0 , provided the particle was initially at a given point @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the average of that distribution  the mean first passage time ( mfpt )  is a useful quantity to estimate the speed of transport for systems which are defined on the restricted area .",

    "for example , an application of the diffusion problem on the finite interval to the heat conduction between hot and cold baths is recently of wide interest .",
    "there are several attempts to link such thermodynamical phenomena as heat conductivity to the dynamical diffusion . in this context , the problem of validity of fourier s law , as a counterpart to the fick diffusion law , is especially interesting .",
    "applicability of dynamical processes , which are characterized by the anomalous diffusion coefficient , became clear when the anomalous heat conductivity in classical one - dimensional lattice systems has been found @xcite . a model , called `` dynamical heat channels '' @xcite , can be constructed by introduction some simplifications , e.g. by neglecting the interactions between particles",
    ". then the dynamics can be handled by the decoupled ctrw which implies all kinds of the anomalous diffusion . in this particular model ,",
    "the subdiffusive case requires long tails of the waiting time distribution ; as a result the average waiting time , as well as mfpt @xcite , is infinite . for the heat conduction process that would mean a perfect insulator .",
    "however , that uncoupled version of ctrw does not take into account that , in general , the system may be inhomogeneous , i.e. its parameters depend explicitly on the spatial variable .",
    "this happens in the complex systems where long - range space correlations are important and the medium structure is crucial for the system properties . as an example can serve the transport on the fractal objects @xcite and , since fractals are ubiquitous in nature , its numerous manifestations in various branches of science .",

    "we evaluate the mfpt for a jumping process which is a version of the ctrw : it is markovian and takes into account the spatial dependences of the problem by introduction the @xmath2-dependent waiting time distribution .",
    "effects connected with the finite size of the system are especially pronounced if the particle performs long jumps , namely for the lvy flights , when the second moment of the probability distribution is infinite .",
    "if the distance between boundaries is small , compared to width of the jump length distribution , the tails hardly influence the dynamics and the essence of the lvy process remains hidden . on the other hand , presence of the barriers makes all the moments convergent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we present the definition and main properties of the jumping process . in sec.iii the mfpt for the system which possesses two absorbing barriers",

    "the process value @xmath6 is constant between consecutive jumps .",

    "moreover , it was used to describe the transport of fast electrons in a hot plasma @xcite and the turbulent two - particle diffusion @xcite .",
    "a natural choice for the distribution @xmath3 is the gaussian : @xmath10 the corresponding master equation for the jumping process can then be approximated  by means of the kramers - moyal expansion  by the following fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath11}{\\partial x^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the width of the distribution @xmath3 .",

    "this result is in contrast to that of the decoupled ctrw which predicts divergence of the mfpt in the subdiffusive case @xcite .",

    "in this section we analyse the jumping process for the system restricted by two absorbing barriers for which the jumping size distribution is given by the lvy distribution .",
    "we calculate the probability density distributions and the mfpt as a function of both the lvy index @xmath27 and the parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the mfpt problem for the lvy flights on the bounded domain , both with and without a potential , is studied extensively in recent years ; beside the mfpt , the first passage time distribution has been evaluated as a function of the parameters of the lvy distribution , which , in general , can be asymmetric . since the analytical approach is very difficult in this case ,",
    "most of the studies rely on the monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recently an analytical solution to the fractional equation with the boundary conditions , which describes the lvy flights in a homogeneous medium ( @xmath18 ) , has been found @xcite .",
    "the lvy distribution represents the general stable distribution and in that sense it is a generalization of the gaussian .",
    "it accounts for processes for which the second moment of the probability density distribution diverges : the standard central limit theorem does not apply in this case .",
    "phenomena which exhibit distributions with long tails are frequently encountered in nature .",
    "they are typical for systems of high complexity , in particular biological @xcite , social , and financial ones .",
    "therefore , the theory of the lvy flights is widely applicable to problems from various branches of science and technology .",
    "one can expect that presence of the barriers will influence the stochastic dynamics particularly strong in the case of the lvy processes . if the interval length @xmath31 is small compared to the width parameter @xmath12 of the jump length distribution , the power - law tails of the distribution will not manifest themselves . in particular , all moments become finite .",
    "we assume the jump length distribution in the form @xmath65 as well as the poissonian waiting time distribution ( [ poi ] ) .",
    "we determine the probability density distribution @xmath25 by means of the monte carlo method .",
    "the lvy - distributed jump - size density has been generated by using the algorithm from ref .",
    "the time evolution of individual trajectories , which start with the same initial condition , has been performed by sampling consecutive values of the jumping size and the waiting time interval from the densities @xmath3 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the final results have been obtained by averaging over those individual trajectories .",
    "fig.3 presents the time evolution of @xmath25 for both positive and negative @xmath62 .",

    "it happens because the traps at large distances becomes more effective when @xmath62 increases and the transport is hampered due to the long waiting times .",
    "consequently , one can expect that the mfpt will rise with @xmath62 .",
    "this conclusion is illustrated in fig.6 .",
    "growth of the function @xmath79 is especially pronounced for large values of @xmath27 ( close to gaussian case @xmath80 ) because then the average jump length is relatively small and a large number of jumps is needed to reach the barrier .",
    "transition from the negative to positive values of @xmath62  which corresponds to the change of kind of diffusion in the problem without absorbing barriers  is smooth for all @xmath27 .",
    "the latter conclusion holds also for @xmath80 , according to the eq.([13 ] ) .    ,",
    "calculated with @xmath81 , for some values of @xmath27.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "we have analysed the one - dimensional , step - wise jumping process which is defined on the finite interval , bounded by two absorbing barriers .",
    "since the waiting time distribution involves the variable , position - dependent coefficient , the inhomogeneity of the medium has been taken into account . that , power - law , dependence is a reason of the anomalous behaviour : the diffusion can be both weaker and stronger than normal .",
    "the calculated mfpt is large for the subdiffusion and rises with the parameter @xmath62 , nevertheless it always assumes a finite value .",
    "physical reason behind the latter outcome  which can never be concluded from the traditional , uncoupled ctrw models of the subdiffusion  is the weakening of trapping with the increased distance and , as a result , the effective mean waiting time is finite . from the point of view of modelling of the anomalous heat conduction ,",
    "the introduction of the @xmath2-dependent waiting time distribution allows us to describe the subdiffusive heat transport for realistic systems : for those which are not perfect insulators .",
    "restrictions imposed on the system by the existence of the absorbing barriers are pronounced if we allow for long jumps , i.e. if the jumping size distribution @xmath3 is of the lvy form .",
    "the power law tails of that distribution can influence the probability density distribution of the process , @xmath25 , only if @xmath3 is narrow , compared to the distance between the barriers , i.e. to the system size . in that limit , the sections of @xmath25 which are close to the barrier assume the power law shape in the same form as the tails for the problem without the barriers .",
    "conversely , for the broad @xmath3 those tails are hardly visible and the mfpt is almost independent of the lvy parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence of mfpt on the parameter @xmath62 is similar to that for the gaussian @xmath3 : large values of @xmath62 , for which the transport is strongly hampered by the traps , result in large @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless , it remains finite , for any @xmath27 and @xmath62 ."
