    "the realization , based on observational data , that the expansion of the universe is accelerated has led to a lot of work which modifies traditional cosmological models by introducing exotic types of matter or replacing general relativity by something else .",
    "the focus of interest in the following is an example of the second approach .",
    "it concerns the cardassian models which were first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the standard solutions of the einstein equations applied in cosmology are those which are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "these are the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models .",
    "often attention is concentrated on the spatially flat case , where the spacetime metric takes the form @xmath0 with scale factor @xmath1 . in these solutions a central role is played by the friedmann equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy density , @xmath4 is the cosmological constant and geometrized units are used where the gravitational constant and the speed of light take the numerical value unity .",
    "the other independent einstein equation is the evolution equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pressure . as a consequence of energy - momentum conservation",
    "the matter quantities @xmath3 and @xmath6 satisfy @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter .",
    "it is well known that if equation ( [ friedmann ] ) is satisfied at some time @xmath9 and equations ( [ evolution ] ) and ( [ euler ] ) are satisfied at all times then ( [ friedmann ] ) is satisfied at all times .",
    "this is a special case of the general phenomenon of propagation of the constraints in solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "accelerated expansion means that @xmath10 and it follows from ( [ evolution ] ) that this is only possible if @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "many matter models in general relativity satisfy the strong energy condition @xmath13 which corresponds to the fact that gravity is attractive .",
    "accelerated expansion is only possible in general relativity if either @xmath11 or there is a matter field ( dark energy ) which violates the strong energy condition .",
    "the idea of @xcite is to replace general relativity by another theory so as to make accelerated cosmological expansion possible with a vanishing cosmological constant and without the need for matter violating the strong energy condition .    in the cardassian models of @xcite , which are formulated for homogeneous and isotropic geometries , the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] )",
    "is replaced by the equation @xmath14 for a smooth function @xmath15 .",
    "the standard choice for @xmath16 has the power - law form @xmath17 for constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 but in principle the formalism can be developed for any function @xmath15 . in later work @xcite this approach was changed and the cardassian term is only a function of part of the energy density of the matter , the rest energy density .",
    "this splitting requires the input of more information than the energy - momentum tensor alone .",
    "the analysis in this paper will concentrate on the original version although the later version will be commented on .    in @xcite a possible origin of the additional term in the cardassian framework",
    "was discussed in the context of braneworld models .",
    "a cardassian term also arises in loop quantum cosmology as a manifestation of the discreteness of spacetime @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the constant @xmath18 is negative .",
    "if the cardassian models are to be regarded as defining a theory of gravity then there should exist a definition of these models applying to solutions without symmetry which reduces to the known definition in the homogeneous and isotropic case .",
    "a general theory of this type is also of practical importance for comparisons with cosmological observations .",
    "some of these comparisons use linearization around the homogeneous and isotropic models . in order to obtain the field equations for linearized perturbations",
    "the natural procedure is to start with a general theory and linearize . to the authors knowledge",
    "no such general theory has been found .",
    "the comparison of theory with some aspects of observations , e.g. estimates of the age of the universe or supernova data , only requires the scale factor but other data such as that on cosmic microwave background fluctuations requires more structure ( including an understanding of linear perturbations ) on the theoretical side to allow a comparison .",
    "the fact that calculations could be done for linearized perturbations is based on the use of what will be called the effective fluid in what follows .    because of the high symmetry of homogeneous and isotropic geometries any cardassian model with a specific choice of @xmath15 and matter modelled by a perfect fluid with a specific choice of equation of state @xmath20 is equivalent to general relativity with an effective fluid with equation of state @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is determined uniquely by @xmath15 and @xmath23 .",
    "starting from this observation it is possible to use the linearized einstein - euler equations with this effective equation of state to do perturbation theory .",
    "if , on the other hand , another specific description of matter , such as kinetic theory , is used then things are more complicated . for a particular solution of the einstein equations coupled to this matter model which is homogeneous and isotropic it is possible to define energy density and pressure and , with a suitable monotonicity assumption , an equation of state relating the two .",
    "however this equation of state depends on the solution ( and hence on the initial data ) and as a consequence not only on the choice of matter model .",
    "thus it can not be used to define a generalization to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "the unfortunate lack of a general theory can not simply be overcome by an appeal to braneworld models or loop quantum cosmology since these constructions have also only been carried out fully under symmetry assumptions .    it will be shown that it is possible to define a natural generalization of the cardassian models to spacetimes which are homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic .",
    "this accomodates any form of matter . for general matter models",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is intrinsically anisotropic - it has distinct principal pressures - and so this can not be replaced by any effective perfect fluid description .",
    "a limitation of this definition is that , as will be shown in section 3 , for the most general classes of homogeneous geometries and matter it requires the assumption that the cosmological expansion never vanishes in order to have a regular evolution equation .",
    "an interesting dynamical feature of cardassian models in contrast to general relativity with conventional fluid is the occurrence of big rip singularities @xcite .",
    "this means that the scale factor @xmath1 tends to infinity in a finite proper time .",
    "the main result of this paper is that under general assumptions homogeneous spacetimes isotropize in the approach to a big rip singularity .",
    "this is analogous to the cosmic no hair theorem for the late - time behaviour of solutions of the einstein equations with positive cosmological constant and its proof in the homogeneous case due to wald @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains an analysis of the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cardassian models using an effective potential .",
    "the method of an effective fluid is also described , together with its limitations . in section 3 the generalization to cases which are homogeneous but not isotropic",
    "is presented and isotropization near a big rip singularity is proved . in the last section possible further developments of cardassian models and related topics are discussed .",
    "this paper is based in part on the diploma thesis of the first author @xcite .",
    "the basic equation for cardassian models is ( [ friedmannc ] ) .",
    "the analysis of this section is restricted to isotropic models but spatial curvature is included so that ( [ friedmannc ] ) becomes @xmath24 the curvature parameter @xmath25 is @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the equation ( [ euler ] ) expressing energy - momentum conservation remains unchanged .",
    "differentiating ( [ friedmannck ] ) with repect to time and using ( [ euler ] ) in the result gives the following evolution equation : @xmath29.\\ ] ] it is clear from this expression that accelerated expansion is possible even when the matter satisfies the strong energy condition . these equations for describing gravity can in principle",
    "be combined with any model of matter .",
    "the equations of motion of the matter are assumed to take exactly the same form as in general relativity .",
    "the remainder of this section will concentrate on the case where the matter is described by a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath20 .",
    "other matter models will be included in the discussion of anisotropic geometries in the next section .",
    "the dynamics of isotropic models with a fluid will now be analysed . a convenient way of doing this is to use the analogy of the motion of a particle in a potential .",
    "it is assumed that the function @xmath23 defining the equation of state is non - negative with @xmath30 and satisfies @xmath31 for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "define a quantity @xmath32 representing the mass density of the fluid by @xmath33 under the given assumptions @xmath34 . from ( [ defr ] )",
    "it can be concluded that @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that the mapping from @xmath3 to @xmath32 can be inverted . integrating equation ( [ euler ] )",
    "shows that @xmath39 is time independent . combining this with the conservation law results in a relation @xmath40 for a function @xmath41 depending on @xmath23 . in the particular case that @xmath23 is a linear function of @xmath3 the function @xmath41 is equal to a constant times a power of @xmath42 .",
    "define a potential @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "then the dynamics of @xmath42 is equivalent to that of a particle in this potential .",
    "the particle has energy @xmath45 as a consequence of ( [ friedmannck ] ) .",
    "the picture with the potential is useful for giving an intuitive method for seeing how the dynamics looks .",
    "it can however do more and give rigorous proofs of the main features of the dynamics . for the convenience of the reader",
    "this will be shown in detail in an appendix .",
    "consider the case , which may be called the standard case , where the cardassian term is defined by @xmath46 and the equation of state of the perfect fluid is @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath49 for a positive constant @xmath50 and @xmath51 the cases @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be excluded from consideration since the first can be identified with general relativity with cosmological constant and the second is general relativity with vanishing cosmological constant in disguise .",
    "these cases are already sufficiently well known .",
    "the domain of definition of the potential is @xmath54 since @xmath50 is positive and @xmath55 is negative .",
    "the derivative @xmath56 has a zero @xmath57 if and only if either @xmath58 and @xmath59 or @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in both cases",
    "@xmath62^{\\frac{1}{3(n-1)\\gamma}}.\\ ] ] important information about the potential is provided by the sign of @xmath63 at the critical point . @xmath64\\ ] ] from this it follows that for @xmath65 the potential has a minimum at @xmath57 while for @xmath66 it has a maximum there .",
    "it is now easy to read off information about the qualitative behaviour of the solution using the results of the appendix . when doing this figs .",
    "[ cardtwofig ] -[cardfig2 ] are useful for the purposes of orientation . in each of these figures a representative potential is shown for the given range of parameters .     and @xmath67 . ]    . ]    since the universe is expanding today only those solutions will be considered which are expanding at some time .",
    "note that this excludes the exceptional time - independent solutions which occur when @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath68 .",
    "the results will be summarized in a proposition .",

    "they are equivalent to models without cardassian term and with a modified value of the curvature .",
    "one of the most interesting types of behaviour included in the statement of the proposition is the fact that for certain cases the big bang singularity is replaced by a bounce .",

    "now the effective fluid approach to isotropic cardassian models will be described .",
    "the idea is to define a new energy density by @xmath111 and a new pressure @xmath112 so that @xmath113 . if this can be done and if the expression for @xmath114 in terms of @xmath3 can be inverted a relation of the form @xmath115 can be obtained .",
    "then the dynamical properties of the cardassian model are equivalent to that of the einstein equations coupled to a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath115 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the effective fluid has exotic properties such as violating the strong and weak energy conditions in general , the latter in the case @xmath60 . in this construction",
    "the relation @xmath116 is obtained . to solve for @xmath3 in terms of @xmath114",
    "it suffices for the condition @xmath117 to be satisfied since then the inverse function theorem can be applied . in the case of a power - law cardassian term",
    "this works in the case @xmath118 but not when @xmath119 . in the latter case the attempt to carry out this construction leads to an equation of state which is not single - valued .",

    "by comparison with models with a fluid with exactly linear equation of state it may be guessed that power - law inflation will occur for @xmath19 in the range @xmath124 .",
    "this is confirmed by the formula ( [ inflation ] ) .",
    "to end this section the alternative approach to cardassian models will be considered briefly . in this case",
    "the expression @xmath125 in ( [ friedmannc ] ) is replaced by @xmath126 for two independent quantities @xmath127 and @xmath128 . here",
    "@xmath127 represents the rest energy density and @xmath128 all other forms of energy contained in the matter .",
    "the equations of motion for the matter are @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in the case that @xmath121 the dynamics",
    "can be modelled by the potential @xmath131 the critical points of this potential are not so easy to determine as those of the potential in ( [ potential1 ] ) and it may not be possible to compute them explicitly",
    ". nevertheless it should be possible to do a complete analysis of the qualitative features of the dynamics with some more work .",
    "there is a natural way to generalize the cardassian models to the case of spacetimes which are homogeneous but not isotropic .",
    "the basic principle is to require the propagation of the constraint equations .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint , which corresponds to the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) in the isotropic case , is modified when passing from general relativity to the cardassian case in exactly the same way as was done for isotropic models - the energy density @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath125 and all other terms are left unchanged .",
    "the momentum constraint is left as it is .",
    "the equations of motion of the matter , and hence the equation for energy - momentum conservation , are as in general relativity .",
    "then the question of the propagation of the constraints is posed . if both the constraints are satisfied at some time @xmath132 and a certain evolution equation generalizing ( [ evolutionc ] ) is satisfied at all times together with the equations of motion of the matter are the constraints satisfied at all times ?",
    "it turns out that there is an evolution equation which gives a positive answer to this question and reduces to the usual evolution equation for general relativity when the cardassian term @xmath15 vanishes .",
    "this equation will now be written down .",
    "the spatially homogeneous spacetimes can be divided into the bianchi spacetimes of types i - ix and the kantowski - sachs spacetimes . in the following only bianchi models will be considered , although it would presumably be possible to carry out a similar analysis in the kantowski - sachs case . in the case of the bianchi models it is possible to assume without loss of generality that the spatial manifold is simply connected . for passing from a bianchi model to its universal cover does not change the dynamics .",
    "once this has been done the spatial manifold can be identified with a simply connected three - dimensional lie group @xmath133 and the metric and other geometrical objects can usefully be parametrized by their components in a basis of left - invariant one - forms @xmath134 on @xmath133 with a dual basis @xmath135 of vector fields .",
    "the spatial metric is specified by a matrix @xmath136 depending only on time .",
    "the spacetime metric is of the form @xmath137 .",
    "let @xmath138 be the second fundamental form of the hypersurfaces of constant @xmath139 and define @xmath140 .",
    "in the isotropic case this quantity @xmath141 reduces to the hubble parameter introduced previously .",
    "the modified hamiltonian constraint is @xmath142 the evolution equation for the second fundamental form is @xmath143 with trace @xmath144 combining this with the generalized hamiltonian constraint gives @xmath145 here @xmath146 is the spatial projection of the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath147 \\delta^i_j.\\ ] ] in the isotropic case ( [ trkevol2 ] ) and ( [ udef ] ) reduce to ( [ evolutionc ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath148 is in general only well defined as long as @xmath149 since there are two terms with @xmath150 in the denominator .",
    "the first of these vanishes in bianchi class a while the second is regular in the case of an untilted perfect fluid .",
    "( for the definitions of these terms the reader is referred to @xcite . ) without these restrictions it could happen that the evolution breaks down .",
    "it is however the case that for the types of solutions which will be of most interest in the following some control of the apparently singular terms can be obtained .",
    "the source of this control are some inequalities implied by the hamiltonian constraint which will now be presented . equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the tracefree part of @xmath138 . in bianchi types",
    "i - viii it is known that @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "thus if a solution is of one of these bianchi types and if @xmath15 is non - negative then if @xmath150 tends to zero at some time it follows that @xmath3 tends to zero , with @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .    in spacetimes which are not isotropic",
    "the momentum constraint becomes non - trivial and must be taken into account .",
    "as has already been mentioned , for the cardassian models it is assumed that the momentum constraint takes exactly the same form as in general relativity . this assumption is used in the calculation to verify that the hamiltonian constraint propagates . in showing that the momentum constraint itself propagates",
    "the key feature of the modified evolution equation which is used is that the modification only affects the trace while the tracefree part of the equation remains unchanged .",
    "it will now be investigated how solutions of these equations behave near a big rip singularity .",
    "this means by definition that the determinant @xmath157 of the spatial metric or equivalently , in more geometrical language , its volume form tends to infinity in finite time .",
    "assumptions will be made which are analogous to those made in @xcite .",
    "consider a spacetime of bianchi type i - viii which is expanding at some time and satisfies the cardassian equations introduced above .",
    "suppose further that the matter content of spacetime satisfies the dominant and strong energy conditions .",
    "thus there is no dark energy included .",
    "finally , suppose that the cardassian term is of the form @xmath46 with @xmath58 and @xmath103 .",
    "it will now be shown that in a spacetime of this type @xmath150 remains negative as long as a smooth solution exists .",
    "in fact it will be shown that as long as @xmath150 is bounded there can not exist a sequence of times @xmath158 approaching the end of an interval where the solution exists for which @xmath159 . for this purpose ,",
    "suppose that there is a smooth solution defined on a time interval @xmath160 with @xmath150 bounded and a sequence @xmath161 with the property in question .",
    "let @xmath162 denote the right hand side of ( [ trkevol2 ] ) . then @xmath163 using the remarks following ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) it can be seen that all terms in @xmath162 except @xmath164 can be bounded by an expression of the form @xmath165 for a constant @xmath92 . under the assumption that @xmath150 is bounded",
    "this implies that @xmath166 for a constant @xmath92 .",
    "the terms in @xmath164 involving @xmath15 satisfy the same type of bound .",
    "it remains to consider the expressions in @xmath162 where @xmath150 occurs in the denominator . in order to obtain an estimate for @xmath167",
    "it is useful to evaluate it in an orthonormal frame .",
    "there the components of @xmath168 can be bounded by @xmath3 due to the dominant energy condition while the rotation coefficients are of order one .",
    "thus @xmath169 for a constant @xmath92 and @xmath170 . to deal with the last term in @xmath164 first note that @xmath171 thus there is an explicit contribution @xmath172 to @xmath164",
    "this is no more difficult to estimate than the terms already discussed . for the remaining quantity to be estimated it is possible to use the inequality that @xmath173 .",
    "the dominant energy condition shows that any component of @xmath174 in an orthonormal frame is bounded by @xmath3 .",
    "hence the last expression can be bounded by @xmath175 .",
    "putting all this information together and writing @xmath176 gives an inequality of the form @xmath177 gives the conclusion that @xmath178 on the whole interval , in contradiction to the orginal assumptions .",
    "this proves the desired result concerning @xmath150 .",
    "note that it follows form this result that @xmath179 has a strictly positive lower bound on the given interval .",
    "estimates for the spacetime will be obtained with the help of a quantity @xmath180 .",
    "this is modelled on the quantity @xmath174 introduced for similar purposes in @xcite which in turn was influenced by the arguments of @xcite .",
    "@xmath181 here the equality of the second and third expressions follows from the modified hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "now introduce a quantity @xmath184 which is positive and satisfies @xmath185 .",
    "this is a replacement for @xmath42 in the isotropic case . at a big rip singularity @xmath186",
    "tends to infinity .",
    "it follows from ( [ dzbydt ] ) that @xmath187 hence @xmath188 . as a consequence @xmath189 for a positive constant @xmath190 .",
    "it follows that @xmath191 .",
    "now this can be put back into the modified hamiltonian constraint to obtain a useful lower bound for @xmath192 , using the fact that in bianchi types i - viii the scalar curvature @xmath193 is non - positive .",
    "compare the remarks following equation ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) .",
    "there results an inequality of the form @xmath194 , where the positive constant @xmath195 depends only on @xmath190 and @xmath18 .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath196 must tend to zero within a finite time only depending on @xmath195 , provided the solution exists that long .",
    "thus it has been shown under the given assumptions that if every solution continues to exist as long as @xmath186 remains bounded then every solution will end in a big rip singularity in finite time .",
    "the existence statement is dependent on the choice of matter model and will be addressed later .",
    "it will now be shown that the geometry isotropizes in the approach to the big rip singularity in these models .",
    "this means by definition that @xmath197 tends to zero as @xmath139 tends to the time @xmath98 where @xmath186 tends to infinity . since @xmath180 is bounded by a constant times @xmath198 as @xmath199 it follows from the definition of @xmath180 that @xmath200 in this limit . on the the other hand by the modified hamiltonian constraint it follows that @xmath201 and",
    "so the quotient of interest decays at least as fast as @xmath202 as @xmath199 .",
    "the quotients @xmath203 and @xmath204 satisfy similar estimates which says that the density becomes negligible compared to the critical density and the spatial scalar curvature becomes unimportant in the approach to the big rip singularity .",
    "it is possible to refine these statements so as to obtain more detailed information about the asymptotics of the geometry in the limit @xmath199 .",
    "this is analogous to the refinement of wald s theorem proved by lee @xcite .",
    "the first step is to determine the leading order asymptotics of @xmath150 . from the modified hamiltonian constraint and",
    "the estimates already obtained it follows that @xmath205 consider now the right hand side of equation ( [ trkevol ] ) .",
    "@xmath206 for a power law cardassian term @xmath207 . in the case of a perfect fluid with equation of state",
    "@xmath121 the explicit contribution containing @xmath208 coming from ( [ decomp ] ) adds to @xmath209 to give @xmath210 .",
    "hence @xmath211 with the information available concerning @xmath180 the estimates previously obtained for the terms containing @xmath167 and @xmath212 can be improved .",
    "putting all these facts together shows that @xmath213 it follows that @xmath214 and that @xmath215 for a constant @xmath216 .",
    "thus the exact leading order asymptotics for @xmath150 and @xmath186 have been obtained .    with @xmath150 under control",
    "the leading order asymptotics of the metric can also be determined .",
    "the starting point is the equation @xmath217 .",
    "it follows from this that @xmath218 . by using some linear algebra as in @xcite",
    "it is possible to obtain an estimate of the form @xmath219 here @xmath9 is some fixed time and the norms are the matrix norms of the matrices of components of the corresponding geometric objects . the norm of @xmath220 can be estimated in terms of @xmath221 for which a decay estimate in the approach to @xmath222 has already been obtained .",
    "there result bounds for the norm of @xmath223 and for the components @xmath224 .",
    "an analogous argument can be applied to bound the components @xmath225 .",
    "thus the metric @xmath224 is uniformly equivalent to the flat metric with components @xmath226 . using the evolution equation for @xmath227",
    "again shows that this quantity converges to a limit @xmath228 as @xmath199 .",
    "its inverse also converges so that @xmath228 is non - degenerate .",
    "finally the leading term in the expansion of the metric can be derived .",
    "the results which have been proved assuming a continuation criterion will now be summed up in a theorem .    * theorem * consider a spatially homogeneous solution of bianchi type i - viii of the cardassian equations ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ kevol ] ) in the case that @xmath46 with @xmath58 and @xmath103 .",
    "suppose that the matter is described by a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath121 , @xmath48 .",
    "if the solution is expanding at some time then the determinant of the metric tends to infinity at a finite time @xmath98 in the future . for @xmath199 @xmath229 and @xmath230 .    note how similar this result is to that in the homogeneous case . as in that case more detailed",
    "asymptotics can be obtained if desired @xcite . to complete the proof of this theorem",
    "a continuation criterion must be proved . is is contained in the following lemma .",
    "* lemma * under the assumptions of the theorem if the solution exists on a time interval @xmath231 for some finite @xmath232 and the determinant of the metric remains bounded as @xmath233 then the solution can be extended to an interval @xmath234 for some @xmath235 .    * proof * a key fact in proving this lemma is the boundedness of @xmath180 .",
    "the energy density satisfies the evolution equation @xmath236 here it has been used that @xmath180 is bounded in order to bound the term containing @xmath237 .",
    "this implies that @xmath238 it can be concluded that since @xmath186 is bounded on the given interval the same is true of @xmath239 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath180 is bounded again shows that @xmath150 is bounded .",
    "it is already known that @xmath240 and @xmath3 are bounded .",
    "the bounds for @xmath150 and @xmath221 can be used to bound @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath138 by a method which was already used above .",
    "it follows from the boundedness of @xmath150 that @xmath243 is also bounded , as was shown following ( [ gronwall ] ) . from this point",
    "the rest of the proof proceeds essentially as in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "the solution remains in a compact subset of the region where the coefficients of the evolution equations for the second fundamental form are regular as a consequence of the fact that @xmath150 can not approach zero .",
    "the analysis of the lemma can be extended to other reasonable matter models .",
    "this includes mixtures of non - interacting fluids with linear equations of state .",
    "it also includes the case of collisionless matter satisfying the vlasov equation .",
    "this provides a model of the distribution of galaxies which includes velocity dispersion .",
    "the only new element which comes in is the need for a suitable local existence theorem with continuation criterion .",
    "this can be proved in the same way for these matter models as in the case of a single fluid already discussed .",
    "the proof follows the arguments in section 4 of @xcite as before and , in the case of collisionless matter , those of section 2 of @xcite .",
    "this implies a partial analogue of the theorem for the other matter models .",
    "the statements about the occurrence of a big rip singularity and the isotropization of the geometry as it is approached go through without change .",
    "more precise information concerning the leading terms in the asymptotics depend on the details of the matter model chosen . for it is necessary to know the leading order behaviour of the pressure as a function of the energy density . in the case of a mixture of fluids",
    "the fluid with the smallest value of @xmath244 will dominate . in the case of collisionless matter the leading order behaviour",
    "will be like that of dust since for collisionless matter @xmath245 when the scale factor tends to infinity .",
    "in this paper the cardassian models in cosmology were extended to a large class of geometries which are homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic .",
    "it was shown that for bianchi types i - viii , matter described by a perfect fluid with linear equation of state and cardassian terms of the form @xmath17 with @xmath58 and @xmath103 the property of isotropic models that all solutions develop a big rip singularity extends to all the homogeneous models .",
    "moreover the homogeneous models approach isotropic and spatially flat models in a strong sense as the big rip singularity is approached .    at the same time",
    "it was pointed out that there is no obvious way of extending further to the inhomogeneous case so that it is not really possible to call the cardassian models a theory of gravitation .",
    "this statement does depend on the point of view that reinterpreting the homogeneous and isotropic models in terms of an exotic fluid and passing to the inhomogeneous case in the context of the einstein equations coupled to that fluid is not a satisfactory solution to the problem .",
    "arguments supporting this point of view were presented .",
    "it is difficult to rule out that there is some natural general inhomogeneous version of the cardassian models but the authors have failed to find one .    at a time when new models designed to address the question of the nature of the cause of accelerated expansion are proliferating ,",
    "some of them differing from general relativity , it would be good to pose the question at an early stage of the history of such a model whether there is indeed a general theory behind it",
    ". there are cases where this is clear , as with the @xmath246 theories which ar presently very popular or other higher order theories such as those with lagrangian @xmath247 .",
    "this includes the fact that the field equations for these theories are known to be well posed @xcite .",
    "the example of the cardassian models shows that things are not always so simple .",
    "it may be that the range of applicability of a proposed model does not go beyond the homogeneous case .",
    "big rip singularities can occur for other models which have been introduced to explain accelerated cosmological expansion .",
    "this applies in particular to general relativity coupled to certain types of exotic matter .",
    "it may well be that the isotropization phenomenon exhibited in this paper for cardassian models also occurs in the approach to big rip singularities produced by other mechanisms .",
    "this remains to be investigated .",
    "let @xmath43 be a smooth function defined on an interval @xmath248 of real numbers where @xmath249 and @xmath250 may be finite or infinite . to exclude trivialities",
    "suppose that @xmath43 is not constant .",
    "consider the equation @xmath251 .",
    "the energy @xmath252 is independent of time .",
    "corresponding to initial data at some time @xmath9 for a solution of this equation there is a solution on a maximal interval @xmath253 beyond which it can not be extended smoothly . here",
    "@xmath254 and @xmath255 may be finite or infinite .",
    "if one of them is finite then as @xmath139 tends to this endpoint @xmath1 must come arbitrarily close to @xmath249 or @xmath250 . for if not conservation of energy implies that @xmath256 remains bounded .",
    "then @xmath42 and @xmath256 remain in a compact subset of the admissible values where the coefficients of the equation are regular and by a standard result on ordinary differential equations @xcite the solution can be extended , contradicting the original assumption .",
    "let @xmath1 be a solution with initial data given by @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "its energy is @xmath259 .",
    "let @xmath260 if the set over which the infimum is to be taken is non - empty and @xmath261 otherwise .",
    "correspondingly , let @xmath262 if the set over which the supremum is to be taken is non - empty and @xmath263 otherwise . if @xmath264 then @xmath265 and the solution is time independent .",
    "otherwise the solution defines an interval @xmath266 $ ] of positive length .",
    "suppose that @xmath267 and that the solution reaches the point @xmath268 at a finite time @xmath269",
    ". then @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "if @xmath272 were zero the solution could only be the time independent solution at @xmath268 . thus @xmath273 and @xmath42 is greater than @xmath268 at times slightly after @xmath232 . in summary , if the solution reaches a point @xmath268 in the interval @xmath248 after finite time it must turn around and start increasing .",
    "the same argument applies to the evolution backwards in time .",
    "an analogous statement can be obtained with @xmath268 replaced by @xmath274 by a similar argument .",
    "a solution behaves in a monotone way as long as it is strictly between @xmath268 and @xmath274 since @xmath256 can never vanish there .",
    "thus if in a given solution @xmath70 is @xmath256 will increase for all @xmath275 unless @xmath276 . in the latter case",
    "@xmath256 will change sign and @xmath42 will start to decrease . if @xmath277 then @xmath278 will decrease for all @xmath275 unless @xmath279 .",
    "similar statements apply to the past time direction .",
    "if both @xmath268 and @xmath274 are in @xmath248 then there are two times @xmath232 and @xmath280 at which the solution reaches @xmath268 . at these times",
    "the initial data are identical and so the solution is periodic , oscillating between the two endpoints @xmath268 and @xmath274 .",
    "thus the following cases are possible .",
    "the solution is time independent ( type 1 ) .",
    "the solution is periodic ( type 2 ) .",
    "the solution is such that @xmath256 changes sign exactly once ( type 3 ) .",
    "the solution is such that the sign of @xmath256 is constant ( type 4 ) . which of these types occur",
    "is easily decided in terms of the position of @xmath268 and @xmath274 . in types 1 and 2",
    "this already determines the essential features of the dynamics . in types 3 and 4",
    "it remains to decide the following .",
    "how does the solution behave during the monotone approach to the point @xmath249 or @xmath250 ? it can be assumed without loss of generality that @xmath281 in the time interval of interest and approaches @xmath250 .",
    "it should be remembered that @xmath250 may be finite or infinite and that , independently of this , @xmath255 may be finite or infinite . for the case being considered here to occur it must be the case that @xmath282 close to @xmath250 . by conservation of energy @xmath283 .",
    "thus what happens depends on the details of the limiting behaviour of @xmath43 as @xmath284 and its relation to @xmath285 . in the examples of relevance in this paper it is always the case that @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
