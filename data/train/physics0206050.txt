    "we consider applications of numerical  analytical technique based on modification of our variational - wavelet approach to nonlinear collective models of beam / plasma physics , e.g. some forms of vlasov / boltzmann - like reductions from general bbgky hierarchy ( section 2 ) .",
    "these equations are related to the modeling of propagation of intense charged particle beams in high - intensity accelerators and transport systems [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . in our approach",
    "we use fast convergent multiscale variational - wavelet representations , which allows to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities [ 3]-[16 ] , [ 17 ] .",
    "the solutions are represented via the multiscale decomposition in nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes ( generalized gluckstern modes , in some sense ) , which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying hidden time / space or phase space scales .",
    "in contrast with different approaches we do nt use perturbation technique or linearization procedures . in section 3 after formulation of key points we consider another variational approach based on ideas of para - products and nonlinear approximation in multiresolution approach , which gives the possibility for computations in each scale separately [ 18 ] . we consider representation ( 4 ) below , where each term corresponds to the contribution from the scale @xmath0 in the full underlying multiresolution decomposition as multiscale generalization of old ( nonlinear ) @xmath1 approach [ 1 ] . as a result ,",
    "fast scalar / parallel modeling demonstrates appearance of high - localized coherent structures ( waveletons ) and pattern formation in systems with complex collective behaviour .",
    "let m be the phase space of ensemble of n particles ( @xmath2 ) with coordinates @xmath3 with distribution function @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the n - particle distribution functions ( @xmath6 is permutation group of n elements ) .",
    "for s=1,2 we have from general bbgky hierarchy : @xmath7 @xmath8 where partial liouvillean operators are described in [ 17 ] .",
    "we are interested in the cases when @xmath9 where @xmath10 are correlation patterns , really have additional reductions as in case of vlasov - like systems .",
    "then we have in ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) polynomial type of nonlinearities ( more exactly , multilinearities ) .",
    "our goal is the demonstration of advantages of the following representation @xmath11 for the full exact solution for the systems related to equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) .",
    "it is possible to consider ( 4 ) as multiscale generalization of old ( nonlinear ) @xmath1 approach [ 1 ] . in ( 4 ) each @xmath12 term corresponds to the contribution from the scale @xmath0 in the full underlying multiresolution decomposition @xmath13 of the proper function space ( @xmath14 , hilbert , sobolev , etc ) to which @xmath15 is really belong .",
    "it should be noted that ( 4 ) does nt based neither on perturbations nor on linearization procedures .",
    "although usually physicists , who prefered computer modelling as a main tool of understanding of physical reality , do nt think about underlying functional spaces , but many concrete features of complicated complex dynamics are really related not only to concrete form / class of operators / equations but also depend on the proper choice of function spaces where operators actully act .",
    "moreover , we have for arbitrary @xmath16 in the finite n - mode approximation @xmath17 the following more useful decompositions : @xmath18 in case when @xmath19 is the coarsest scale of resolution and where @xmath20 and bases in scale spaces @xmath21 are generated from base functions @xmath22 by action of affine group of translations and dilations ( the so called `` wavelet microscope '' ) .",
    "the following constructions based on variational approach provide the best possible fast convergence properties in the sense of combined norm @xmath23 introduced in [ 17 ] .",
    "our five basic points after functional space choice are :    1 .",
    "ansatz - oriented choice of the ( multidimensional ) bases related to some polynomial tensor algebra .",
    "some example related to general bbgky hierarchy is considered in [ 17 ] .",
    "2 .   the choice of proper variational principle .",
    "a few projection/ galerkin - like principles for constructing ( weak ) solutions are considered in [ 3 ] - [ 16 ] .",
    "it should be noted advantages of formulations related to biorthogonal ( wavelet ) decomposition .",
    "the choice of bases functions in scale spaces @xmath24 from wavelet zoo .",
    "they correspond to high - localized ( nonlinear ) oscillations / excitations , coherent ( nonlinear ) resonances , etc . besides fast convergence properties of the corresponding variational - wavelet expansions it should be noted minimal complexity of all underlying calculations , especially in case of choice of wavelet packets which minimize shannon entropy .",
    "operators representations providing maximum sparse representations for arbitrary ( pseudo ) differential/ integral operators @xmath25 , etc [ 17 ] . 5 .",
    "( multi)linearization .",
    "besides variation approach we consider now a different method to deal with ( polynomial ) nonlinearities .",
    "we modify the scheme of our variational approach in such a way in which we consider different scales of multiresolution decomposition ( 5 ) separately .",
    "for this reason we need to compute errors of approximations .",
    "the main problems come of course from nonlinear ( polynomial ) terms .",
    "we follow according to the multilinearization ( in case below ",
    "bilinearization ) approach of beylkin , meyer etc from [ 18 ] .",
    "let @xmath26 be projection operators on the subspaces @xmath27 ( 5 ) : @xmath28 and @xmath29 are projection operators on the subspaces @xmath24 : @xmath30 .",
    "so , for @xmath31 we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is obviously that we can represent @xmath34 in the following form : @xmath35 in this formula there is no interaction between different scales .",
    "we may consider each term of ( [ eq : form1 ] ) as a bilinear mappings : @xmath36 @xmath37 for numerical purposes we need formula ( [ eq : form1 ] ) with a finite number of scales , but when we consider limits @xmath38 we have @xmath39 which is para - product of bony , coifman and meyer [ 18 ] .",
    "now we need to expand ( [ eq : form1 ] ) into the wavelet bases .",
    "to expand each term in ( [ eq : form1 ] ) we need to consider the integrals of the products of the basis functions ( 7 ) , e.g. @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the basis functions ( 7 ) . for",
    "compactly supported wavelets @xmath43 where @xmath44 depends on the overlap of the supports of the basis functions and @xmath45 as the distance between scales such that for a given @xmath46 all the coefficients in ( [ eq : form4 ] ) with labels @xmath47 , @xmath48 have absolute values less than @xmath46 .          for the purposes of computing with accuracy",
    "@xmath46 we replace the mappings in ( [ eq : form2 ] ) , ( [ eq : form3 ] ) by @xmath49 @xmath50 since @xmath51 we may consider bilinear mappings ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , ( [ eq : z2 ] ) on @xmath52 . for the evaluation of ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , ( [ eq : z2 ] ) as mappings @xmath53 we need significantly fewer coefficients than for mappings ( [ eq : z1 ] ) , ( [ eq : z2 ] ) .",
    "it is enough to consider only coefficients @xmath54 where @xmath55 is scale function .",
    "also we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 @xmath58 satisfy the standard system of linear equations and after its solution we can recover all bilinear quantities ( 14 )",
    ". then we apply some variation approach from [ 3]-[16 ] , but in each scale separately .",
    "so , after application of points 1 - 5 above , we arrive to explicit numerical - analytical realization of representations ( 4 ) or ( 6 ) .",
    "fig.1 demonstrates the first contribution to the full solution ( 6 ) while fig.2 presents ( stable ) pattern as solution of system ( 2)-(3 ) .",
    "we evaluate accuracy of calculations according to norm introduced in [ 17 ] .",
