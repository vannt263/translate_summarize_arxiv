    "the yangian symmetry of amplitudes appeared in the first instant as the elegant and compact formulation of the symmetry properties of known amplitude expressions and their relation to wilson loop expectation values .",
    "applications of yangian symmetry of amplitudes have been studied e.g. in @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to use the extended symmetries as tools of calculation .",
    "we propose a formulation which allows to exploit easily all the advantages of yangian symmetry in calculations and investigations of amplitudes .    in most investigations of this symmetry on amplitudes drinfeld s formulation in terms of algebra generators  @xcite has been applied . in the case of the symmetry",
    "algebras @xmath7 a formulation in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) was worked out earlier by l.d .",
    "faddeev and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "we rely on the advantages of the qism formulation here .",
    "it has features appearing natural to physicists , because it emerged as the mathematical formulation of the methods developed for the heisenberg spin chain and other integrable models .",
    "our considerations are heavily based on the ideas and techniques of qism . in particular",
    "this means that we associate with a considered @xmath8-particle amplitude @xmath9 a spin chain with @xmath8 sites .",
    "we are going to formulate the condition of yangian symmetry of amplitudes @xmath9 following @xcite in terms of the monodromy matrix @xmath10 as the eigenvalue relation [ tm0 ] ( u )  m = c  m. the eigenvalues @xmath11 play an auxiliary role here .    the monodromy matrix is an ordered matrix product of @xmath12-operators each referring to one site of the spin chain .",
    "the @xmath12-operator is an operator - valued matrix with elements composed out of the symmetry algebra generators in the relevant representation . in our case",
    "the representation space is the one corresponding to the single particle states of the vector multiplet of the @xmath0 extended sym including their helicities and momenta .",
    "the @xmath12-operator depends on the spectral parameter @xmath13 and in general the monodromy matrix depends on @xmath14 .",
    "the above symmetry condition refers to the homogeneous case of coinciding spectral parameters .    in @xcite considering @xmath7-symmetric spin chains the eigenvalue problem for _ inhomogeneous quantum monodromy _ matrices has been formulated as the yangian symmetry condition .",

    "is another important ingredient of qism .",
    "it acts in the tensor product of two infinite - dimensional local quantum spaces and intertwines a pair of @xmath15-site monodromies , i.e. two representations of the yangian algebra .",
    "the corresponding intertwining relation is known as yang - baxter @xmath16-relation .",
    "we shall use yang - baxter @xmath1-operators to generate more solutions of the symmetry condition from given ones .",
    "this works under the condition that the corresponding @xmath1-operators can be permuted with the monodromy matrix in the eigenvalue relation . in this perspective",
    "it has been proposed to consider _ generalized yang - baxter _",
    "relations  @xcite because higher point eigenfunctions of the monodromy define as kernels the corresponding generalized yang - baxter operators obeying these relations .    in this paper",
    "we are going to apply the methods developed in  @xcite to the @xmath17-symmetric spin chain .",
    "this particular integrable quantum - mechanical system has played a crucial role in unravelling the integrable structures of @xmath2 super - yang - mills theory in composite operator renormalization  @xcite and is the relevant one here .",
    "the comparison to the more general case considered in @xcite illustrates the specifics of the situation of super - yang - mills field theory .",
    "the presentation of the present paper is kept basically self - contained with respect to the details of the previous one .",
    "our main statement is the following : the yangian symmetry can be formulated as the the eigenvalue problem for the monodromy matrix and in solving it we recover the crucial constructions for sym scattering amplitudes such as the link integral representation , the inverse soft limit ( isl ) construction , on - shell diagrams which have been pioneered by arkani - hamed and collaborators  @xcite and also @xmath1-invariants  @xcite .",
    "these concepts have been developed originally without reference to yangian symmetry or integrable structure .",
    "we emphasize that all these structures arise inevitably from the basic concepts of qism .",
    "the only input for us is the appropriate eigenvalue problem for monodromy matrices which we solve exploiting solely concepts and constructions typical for qism .",
    "we shall show that the yangian symmetry condition is compatible with the iterative bcfw construction of amplitudes and that the elementary three - particle amplitudes are yangian symmetric .    however , there are eigenfunctions of the yangian symmetry condition more elementary rather than those three - particle amplitudes , called _",
    "basic states_. they are formed by products of delta functions of spinor variables each referring to one site of the @xmath8-site spin chain .",
    "the local structure of these states implies absence of interactions .",
    "it is remarkable that the amplitude terms can be obtained by acting on such basic states by products of yang - baxter @xmath1-operators defined from the @xmath12 matrices by the @xmath16 intertwining relation .",
    "the @xmath1-operators act bilocally touching just two sites of the spin chain .",
    "the sequential action by yang - baxter @xmath1-operators on the basic state results in more and more entangled , nonlocal solutions .",
    "the representation of amplitudes in terms of operator actions has been found earlier in  @xcite without noticing the connection to yang - baxter relations .",
    "we shall also show the relation to the inverse soft limit ( isl ) construction . representing the @xmath1-operator in the form of a contour integral a sequence of @xmath1-operator actions transforms into the grassmannian link integral representation  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the monodromy is invariant with respect to cyclic shifts of spin chain sites and it transforms in a simple manner with respect to reflection of the site ordering .",
    "the fact that a sequence of @xmath1-operators generates an eigenstate is based on the possibility to pull the sequence through the monodromy matrix .",
    "the latter is provided by cyclicity , reflection and the @xmath16-relation .    in order to recover on - shell diagrams from the perspectives of qism we consider integral operators in spinor - helicity variables whose kernels are eigenfunctions of the monodromy . in this way",
    "we identify the yang - baxter @xmath1-operator , the basic tool of our construction , as the integral operator with the cut @xmath18-point amplitude as kernel .",
    "we shall also consider the eigenvalue problem for the monodromy in super momentum twistor variables introduced by hodges  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding construction of eigenfunctions follows the previous pattern .",
    "the basic state has a local form and it is formed as a product of delta functions of super momentum twistors or identity each referring to one site of the spin chain .",
    "the other eigenfunctions of the monodromy are generated again by acting on the basic state with a sequence of bilocal @xmath1-operators now in super momentum twistor variables .",
    "we recover @xmath1-invariants in this way .    for all constructions relevant for sym scattering amplitudes we can restrict ourselves to the case of the homogeneous monodromy which is obtained from the inhomogeneous one by taking all spectral parameters equal .",
    "then the @xmath1-operators appear with argument value zero . solving the eigenvalue condition with inhomogeneous monodromy matrices we obtain spectral parameter dependent deformations of the amplitude expressions .",
    "the deformation affects the dilatation weights , i.e. the superconformal casimir of the representation , shifting them off the physical value originally determined by the scattering particles . keeping the parameters at generic values provides advantages related to analytic continuations .",
    "parameter deformed amplitudes have been considered and the use for regularization has been pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "we show that our techniques allows to obtain easily deformed amplitude expressions and discuss their applications .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",

    "the latter equation for the @xmath12-operator is equivalent to the defining ( anti)commutation relations of @xmath32 .",
    "one of the merits of the quantum inverse scattering method  @xcite is that it enables us to construct involved nonlocal objects out of local ones , where the interaction of several copies of the introduced degrees of freedom is included in integrable way .",

    ". then we invert the @xmath12-operators of the @xmath134-st and @xmath18-th sites using ( [ invertc ] ) , @xmath374 next by partial integration in view of ( [ transp ] ) we rewrite the above equation as an intertwining relation for the integral operator @xmath375 ( [ mfullop ] ) @xmath376 thus the product @xmath377 respects the @xmath16-relation as well as our basic @xmath1-operator ( [ rhel ] ) .",
    "this factorization is a direct analogue of the yang - baxter operators factorization used in the construction of baxter @xmath378-operators in  @xcite .",
    "let us note that if we repeat the previous calculation omitting the cyclic shift @xmath373 then we arrive at the factorization with respect to the second unitarity cut in ( [ factker ] ) .",
    "the obtained results are in accordance with zwiebel s observation  @xcite that the kernels of dilatation operators coincide with mhv amplitudes .",
    "since each @xmath1-operator action ( [ rhel ] ) contains one integration over an auxiliary parameter @xmath126 a sequence of @xmath379 @xmath1-operators is equivalent to a multiple integration over @xmath380 .",
    "previously in sect .",
    "[ sec - nh3 ] we have written down such a multiple integration in the case of @xmath163 and shown that it corresponds to the link integral representation  @xcite .",
    "now we are going to show how this works in the less trivial example of the @xmath18-point eigenfunction @xmath381 .",
    "we act by the appropriate sequence of @xmath1-operators on the basic state @xmath310 ( [ om24 ] ) , @xmath382 @xmath383 the product of delta functions in the previous formula can be rewritten as @xmath384 @xmath385 where we perform a sequence of variable changes @xmath386 in order to get rid of the quadratic and cubic terms in auxiliary parameters .",
    "then we take into account the restriction on the parameters @xmath387 in ( [ m24r ] ) induced by the monodromy condition ( see ( [ tmhv4 ] ) ) and obtain the familiar link integral representation @xmath388 where sums over repeated indices @xmath389 and @xmath390 are assumed and the matrix of link variables is to be identified with the matrix in the integration variables as @xmath391 thus the @xmath1-operator construction naturally leads to link integrals over a grassmannian and to on - shell diagrams .",
    "[ sec - mt ] in sect .",
    "[ sec - canon ] we have seen that the eigenfunctions of the homogeneous monodromy always contain the delta functions of total momentum and supercharge conservation ( [ deltafact ] ) .",
    "it is easy to realize that the same is true for the inhomogeneous monodromy ( [ tnh ] ) .",
    "indeed we can perform the shift of spectral parameters @xmath392 , @xmath330 , without changing the eigenfunction @xmath216 since the latter depends on the differences @xmath393 of spectral parameters .",
    "then we expand the equation in powers of @xmath13 and follow the argumentation of sect .",
    "[ sec - canon ] .",
    "this motivates to choose variables in such a way that this delta function condition is automatically taken into account .",
    "it is well - known that the ( super ) momentum twistor variables introduced by hoges in  @xcite have this property .",
    "super momentum twistors @xmath394 are defined by the following quasilocal algebraic transformation @xcite @xmath395 \\eta_i & = & \\frac{\\chi_{i-1 } \\sang{i}{i+1 } + \\chi_{i } \\sang{i+1}{i-1 } + \\chi_{i+1 } \\sang{i-1}{i}}{\\sang{i-1}{i}\\sang{i}{i+1}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the formulae ( [ mtw ] ) are not invertible .",
    "arbitrary amplitudes can be represented in the form  @xcite @xmath396 where the @xmath311 amplitude @xmath397 contains the delta function of the total momentum and supercharge conservation .",
    "the factor @xmath398 contains all the nontrivial information about the amplitude @xmath399 . in fact the function @xmath398 is a sum of a product of @xmath400 @xmath1-invariants .",
    "the @xmath1-invariant introduced in  @xcite depends on the variables of five points . in",
    "@xcite all tree amplitudes have been constructed solving bcfw relations in terms of @xmath1-invariants in spinor - helicity variables . in",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in super momentum twistor space the @xmath1-invariants are expressed in a particularly simple form .",
    "the simplest @xmath1-invariant has the form [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] = where @xmath401 and it is well - known  @xcite that for the @xmath402 amplitudes the factor @xmath403 is simply a sum of such invariants .",
    "let us choose now the momentum twistors to be the local dynamical variables of the spin chain by the following specifications for coordinates @xmath404 and their conjugate momenta @xmath405 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath12-operator ( [ l ] )  the local building block of the monodromy  takes the form ( u ) = u 1 + _ =    u + z _ z & -z _ + _ z & u - _    . unlike the spinor - helicity representation ( see sect .",
    "[ sec - hel ] ) the @xmath1-operator in momentum twistor variables intertwining in the @xmath16-relation ( [ rll ] ) products of @xmath12-operators in the form ( [ lmt ] ) acts nontrivially only in one of two sites , _",
    "ij(u ) f(_i|_j ) = f(z_i- z z_j , _ i - z _ j | z_j , _",
    "the momentum twistor representation is a particular case of the uniform representation with coordinates @xmath20 identified by @xmath406 and conjugated momenta @xmath83 by the corresponding derivatives . in this case the basic state has the form ( [ omuni ] ) @xmath407 it is an eigenfunction of the monodromy built from momentum twistor @xmath12-operators ( [ lmt ] ) @xmath408 let us remind that @xmath409 and @xmath410 .",
    "indeed from the formulae for local basic states it follows immediately that @xmath411 now acting on @xmath412 by a sequence of @xmath1-operators ( [ rmt ] ) in a way compatible with the monodromy condition we construct more involved eigenfunctions .",
    "let us consider a simple example relevant for scattering amplitudes .",

    "12(u_51 ) ^4|4(_1 ) = @xmath414 \\,.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that this sequence is compatible with the monodromy condition and matches the permutation @xmath415 of spectral parameters . consequently the corresponding eigenvalue is equal to @xmath416 .",
    "the calculation in ( [ rinvdef ] ) is rather simple and generalizes the one presented in sec .",
    "[ sec - nh3 ] from spinors to momentum twistors .",
    "for example after the first bcfw shift we rewrite the bosonic delta function in the form @xmath417 by projecting on four different @xmath19-dimensional planes .",
    "the case relevant for scattering amplitudes corresponds to the homogeneous monodromy where all spectral parameters are equal . in this case",
    "the constructed eigenfunction reproduces the @xmath1-invariant ( [ lowr - inv ] ) [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] = _ 45 _ 34 _ 23 _ 12 ^4|4(_1 ) .",
    "once again we see that the involved highly nonlocal object @xmath418 $ ] is obtained by acting in a local way . as an immediate consequence of the formula ( [ rinv ] ) we conclude that @xmath403 is an eigenfunction of the @xmath8-site homogeneous monodromy and corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath419 .    by repeated @xmath1-operator actions one can reconstruct more involved @xmath1-invariants which are obtained from the simplest one ( [ lowr - inv ] ) by shifts of its arguments . in order to demonstrate how this works",
    "let us indicate here the following formula @xmath420= [ 1,2,3,4,5]\\,f(\\mathcal{z}_1 , \\ang{2345}\\mathcal{z}_1 + \\ang{3451}\\mathcal{z}_2 , \\ang{5123 } \\mathcal{z}_4 + \\ang{1234}\\mathcal{z}_5,\\mathcal{z}_5)\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath92 is assumed to have dilatation weight zero with respect to each of its four arguments . consequently the @xmath1-operator actions reproduce the typical shifts which appear in more involved @xmath1-invariants .",
    "taking into account the previous formula we expect that the explicit solution for all tree amplitudes in terms of super momentum twistors  @xcite can be rewritten as sequences of @xmath1-operators acting on the basic state @xmath421 .",
    "we have formulated yangian symmetry of super yang - mills amplitudes in terms of an eigenvalue relation involving the monodromy matrix . we have demonstrated that the quantum inverse scattering method on which this approach is based provides convenient tools for the calculation and the investigation of amplitudes .",
    "the essential information about the algebraic structure of the symmetry and the particular structure of the representation relevant in the application to super yang - mills field theory enters via the choice of the @xmath12 matrix .",
    "it is the basic elementary block from which the monodromy matrix is constructed",
    ". another important tool is a yang - baxter @xmath1-operator defined by a standard intertwining relation with @xmath12 matrices .",
    "we have shown in particular that the proposed yangian symmetry condition is compatible with the bcfw iterative calculation .",
    "the elementary three - particle amplitudes obey this symmetry and as a consequence also the results of the bcfw iteration starting with them .",
    "solutions of the symmetry condition can be obtained by multiple action with yang - baxter @xmath1-operators on basic states .",
    "the latter appear in the spinor - helicity representation as products of delta distributions in the spinor variables depending on signature in relation to the grassmannian degree .",
    "the construction of amplitude contributions by @xmath1-operators has been demonstrated in a number of examples and the connection to the inverse soft limit construction has been explained .",
    "the action of the @xmath1-operator induces a particular bcfw shift with an integral over the shift parameter .",
    "the integrations involved in a term with a multiple @xmath1 action on a basic state can be transformed into the standard grassmannian link integral .",
    "if one prefers instead of this transformation to do the integrals the number of delta distribution factors present in the basic state is gradually reduced . in a physical amplitude term all those singular factors are removed in this way up to the deltas expressing the conservation of total momentum and supercharge .",
    "symmetric amplitude terms can be viewed as integral kernels of operators acting symmetrically .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1-operator in integral form has the unitarity cut of the four - particle amplitude as its kernel . by this observation one",
    "understands the direct relation between the @xmath1-operator construction and the on - shell diagram approach .",
    "our approach allows to consider loop contributions not only in connection with the on - shell diagramm method .",
    "we see further ways which deserve more detailed investigations .",
    "the relation of amplitudes to integral operator kernels allows to generate more symmetric amplitude contributions from given ones by fusion in terms of integration over the variables of a number of identified legs as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the multiple action by @xmath1-operators on a basic state may be continued after having reproduced the tree amplitude contributions as considered in examples here . in both ways yangian invariants",
    "are generated which are naturally related to loop correction of amplitudes .",
    "it is convenient to consider the yangian symmetry condition without imposing any reality constraints related in particular to the signature of space - time . on the other hand being a tool for generating amplitude contributions this symmetry does not determine completely the physical amplitudes .",
    "the yangian symmetry condition for amplitude terms involves the homogeneous monodromy matrix being a product of @xmath12 matrices including a @xmath12 factor for each leg with coinciding spectral parameters .",
    "the @xmath1-operator appearing in the mentioned construction of amplitude contributions appears at zero value of its spectral parameter .",
    "we like to consider the relations for amplitudes as the limiting case of the ones with the parameters in the @xmath12 matrices not all coinciding ( inhomogeneous monodromy matrices ) and general values of the spectral parameter argument of the @xmath1-operator . we have shown that this is possible and have provided a number of examples .",
    "our method allows to construct higher point yangian invariants for amplitudes with many legs .",
    "presently we do not see straight ways to compact formulae .    the factor remaining in a general amplitude after the separation of the mhv amplitude including the momentum and supercharge conservation is known to be yangian symmetric as well .",
    "regarding this factor we have formulated the symmetry condition in terms of momentum twistors and reconstructed by yang - baxter @xmath1-operator actions the @xmath1-invariant being the basic structure therein .    in this way",
