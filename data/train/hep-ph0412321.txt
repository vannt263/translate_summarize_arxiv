    "specific aspects of hadronic structure are described by several different phenomenological functions .",
    "form factors , usual parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and distribution amplitudes are the so - called `` old '' phenomenological functions since they have been around for a long time . on the other hand , the concept of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) is new .",
    "these `` new '' phenomenological functions are hybrids of the `` old '' ones , and therefore they provide a unified and more detailed description of the hadronic structure .",
    "+ in recent years , significant effort was made to access gpds through the measurement of hard exclusive electro - production processes .",
    "the simplest process in this respect is the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) process , i.e. an electron scatters off a nucleon producing a photon in the final state . using the neutrino beam",
    "instead we extend the dvcs process into the weak sector , where one expects to be sensitive to a different flavor decomposition of gpds , and further , due to the presence of the axial part of the _ v - a _ interaction also sensitive to a different set of gpds . in addition , the weak dvcs process allows us to study flavor non - diagonal gpds , e.g. in the neutron - to - proton transition .",
    "+ detailed study of weak deeply virtual compton scattering with electron and neutrino beams will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "among phenomenological functions we discuss form factors , usual parton distribution functions and generalized parton distributions .",
    "form factors are defined through matrix elements of electromagnetic and weak currents between the hadronic states . in particular , the matrix element of the vector current between the nucleon states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is parametrized in terms of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors , i.e. dirac and pauli form factors ,    @xmath2u\\left(p_{1},s_{1}\\right),\\label{eq : formfactors1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the overall momentum transfer , the invariant @xmath4 and _ m _ denotes the nucleon mass . in the case of the axial vector current one has the axial and pseudoscalar form factors ,    @xmath5u\\left(p_{1},s_{1}\\right).\\label{eq : formfactors2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    both currents in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : formfactors1 ] ) and ( [ eq : formfactors2 ] ) are given by the sum of their flavor components , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric ( in units of @xmath10 ) and axial charges of the quark of flavor _ f _ , respectively .",
    "a similar decomposition holds for the form factors , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "their limiting values at @xmath13 are known , e.g. dirac and pauli form factors give the total electric charge of the nucleon and its anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "+ in particular , the nucleon electromagnetic form factors can be measured through elastic electron - nucleon scattering ,    @xmath14    the process is shown in one photon - exchange approximation in figure [ ffanddis ] , left .",
    "pdfs are defined through forward matrix elements of quark / gluon fields separated by light - like distances . for the unpolarized case one",

    "( [ eq : unpolpdfs ] ) and ( [ eq : polpdfs ] ) as    @xmath20 & = & \\int_{-1}^{1}dx\\ ; e^{-ix\\left(p_{1}z\\right)}\\widetilde{q}_{f}\\left(x\\right),\\nonumber \\\\ \\int_{0}^{1}dx\\;\\left[e^{-ix\\left(p_{1}z\\right)}\\delta q_{f}\\left(x\\right)+e^{ix\\left(p_{1}z\\right)}\\delta\\overline{q}_{f}\\left(x\\right)\\right ] & = & \\int_{-1}^{1}dx\\ ; e^{-ix\\left(p_{1}z\\right)}\\delta\\widetilde{q}_{f}\\left(x\\right).\\label{eq : newintegrals}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    furthermore , one observes that the definition of pdfs has the form of the plane wave decomposition .",
    "thus it allows us to give the momentum space interpretation : @xmath21 is the probability to find the quark / antiquark of flavor _ f _ carrying the momentum @xmath22 inside a fast - moving nucleon having the momentum @xmath23 .",
    "+ pdfs have been intensively studied in hard inclusive processes for the last three decades .",
    "the classic example in this respect is the deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) process , i.e. inclusive scattering of high energy leptons on the nucleon ,    @xmath24    shown in figure [ ffanddis ] , right .",
    "it played a key role in revealing the quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "the structure functions , accessed in the dis process , are directly expressed in terms of pdfs . through the optical theorem ,",
    "its cross section is given by the imaginary part of the forward virtual compton scattering amplitude ( see figure [ optical ] ) .",
    "the summation over _ x _ reflects the inclusive nature of the nucleon structure description by pdfs .",
    "+ in the bjorken regime , where the space - like momentum transfer is sufficiently large together with large total center - of - mass energy of the photon - nucleon system , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the ratio @xmath27 is finite , perturbative qcd factorization works .",
    "in other words , the forward virtual compton scattering amplitude factorizes into perturbatively calculable hard scattering process at the level of quarks and gluons , and process independent matrix elements which contain the soft non - perturbative information about the nucleon structure represented by the blob ( see figure [ fvca ] ) .",
    "we recall that these forward matrix elements consist of quark and gluon operators , whose fields are separated by a light - like distance . they are described and parametrized in terms of pdfs .",
    "schematically , qcd factorization allows us to write the amplitude in the form of the so - called handbag diagrams .",
    "moreover , the leading contribution in the lowest order in the strong coupling constant @xmath28 is given by two ( _ s_- and _ u_-channel ) handbag diagrams in which the hard propagator is convoluted with the pdfs .",
    "taking the imaginary part of the forward virtual compton scattering amplitude generates the delta function , @xmath29^{-1}\\approx\\delta\\left(x\\mp x_{b}\\right)/2\\left(p_{1}\\cdot q_{1}\\right)$ ] .",
    "hence in the dis process one measures the pdf @xmath30 at two points , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 corresponding to the quark pdf and @xmath33 for that of antiquarks .      a more recent attempt to use perturbative qcd to extract new information about",
    "the hadronic structure is the study of hard exclusive electro - production processes , in particular the dvcs process .",
    "this is a much more difficult task due to the small cross sections .",
    "however , high energy and high luminosity electron accelerators combined with large acceptance spectrometers give a unique opportunity to perform precision studies of such reactions .",
    "the dvcs process can be accessed through the reaction    @xmath34    it turns out that factorization into short and long distance dynamics is more general .",
    "having large space - like virtuality of the initial photon while the final state photon is on shell is sufficient for qcd factorization to work .",
    "in contrast to the dis process , the outgoing photon is real , and henceforth , the overall momentum transfer is not equal to zero . in the leading handbag approximation ,",
    "the so - called non - forward virtual compton scattering amplitude is dominated by two diagrams ( see figure [ nonfvca ] ) .",
    "the lower blob now contains the non - forward matrix elements of the same quark and gluon operators as in the forward case .",
    "they are parametrized in terms of gpds . + it is convenient to introduce the average of the nucleon momenta , @xmath35 , and treat the initial and final hadron in a symmetric way ( see figure [ symmetric ] ) .",
    "in this scheme , at the leading twist-2 level , the nucleon structure information can be parametrized in terms of two unpolarized and two polarized gpds denoted by @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "they are functions of three variables @xmath37 , and further they are defined for each quark flavor _",
    "f_. in addition to the usual light - cone momentum fraction _ x _ , gpds also depend upon another scaling variable , the skewness parameter @xmath38 , specifying the longitudinal momentum asymmetry , and upon the invariant _ t_. the variables _ x _ and @xmath39 solely characterize the longitudinal momenta of the partons involved , however , the _ t_-dependence of gpds is related to their transverse momenta .",
    "thus one can simultaneously access the longitudinal momentum and transverse position of the parton in the infinite momentum frame @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by removing the quark with the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath40 and replacing it with the quark of the momentum fraction @xmath41 , one can say that gpds measure the coherence between two different quark momentum states of the nucleon , i.e. the quark momentum correlations in the nucleon , whereas usual pdfs yield only the probability that a quark carries a fraction _ x _ of the nucleon momentum .",
    "+ since @xmath17 in figure [ symmetric ] , the momentum fractions @xmath42 of the active quarks can be either positive or negative .",
    "positive and negative momentum fractions corresponds to quarks and antiquarks , respectively .",
    "therefore gpds have three distinct regions : when @xmath43 both partons represent quarks ( antiquarks ) , whereas for @xmath44 one parton represents a quark , and the other parton an antiquark . in the first two regions gpds",
    "are just the generalizations of the usual pdfs , however , in the third region they behave like a meson distribution amplitude .",
    "hence , in the region @xmath44 , they contain new information about the nucleon structure since this region is not present in dis .",
    "+ gpds have interesting properties linking them to usual pdfs and form factors . in the forward limit , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the gpds @xmath47",
    "coincide with the quark density distribution @xmath48 and the quark helicity distribution @xmath49 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : newfunctionunpol ] ) and ( [ eq : newfunctionpol ] ) obtained from the dis process .",
    "one writes the so - called reduction formulas for the functions @xmath47 ,    @xmath50    and    @xmath51    while the functions @xmath52 have no connections to pdfs .",
    "they are always accompanied with the momentum transfer _ r _ , and therefore invisible in inclusive measurements . in the local limit , @xmath53 , gpds reduce to the form factors . in other words ,",
    "the first moments of gpds are equal to the nucleon elastic form factors .",
    "namely ,    @xmath54    we call these relations the sum rules . they are model and @xmath39-independent .",
    "+ gpds are also relevant for the nucleon spin structure .",
    "in particular , the second moment of the unpolarized gpds at @xmath13 gives the quark angular momentum ,    @xmath55.\\label{eq : quarkangularmomentum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above equation is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "the quark angular momentum , on the other hand , decomposes into the quark intrinsic spin and the quark orbital angular momentum ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is measured through the polarized dis process . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : quarkangularmomentum ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : quarkangularmomentumdecomposition ] ) one can determine @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , since the nucleon spin comes from quarks and gluons , @xmath59 , one can extract the gluon contribution @xmath60 to the nucleon spin .",
    "hence by measuring gpds one obtains information about the angular momentum distributions of quarks and gluons in the hadron .",
    "in the most general case , the virtual compton scattering amplitude is given by a fourier transform of the correlation function of two electroweak currents .",
    "in particular , for the weak dvcs process we have    @xmath61    where @xmath62 corresponds to either the weak neutral current @xmath63 or to the weak charged current @xmath64 , i.e. to the exchange of the weak boson @xmath65 or @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "one of the methods to study the behavior of eq .",
    "( [ eq : weakamplitude ] ) in the generalized bjorken region is to use the light - cone expansion for the time - ordered product of two currents @xmath67 in the coordinate representation .",
    "the expansion is performed in terms of qcd string operators .",
    "its leading order contribution is shown in figure [ handbagdiagrams ] .",
    "the hard part of both handbag diagrams starts at the zeroth order in @xmath28 with the purely tree level diagrams in which the weak virtual boson and real photon interact with quarks being treated as massless fermions .",
    "since the weak current couples to the quark current through two types of vertices , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the quark fields at coordinates @xmath70 can carry either the same or different flavor quantum numbers .",
    "we treat these two cases separately .",

    "furthermore , in addition to the standard electromagnetic dvcs process , we end up with two more terms . + in the next step",
    "we isolate the twist-2 part of the string operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weakneutralexpansion2 ] ) , and sandwich it between the initial and final nucleon state . at this point",
    "we introduce the relevant non - perturbative functions ( gpds ) in order to parametrize the non - forward nucleon matrix elements of the vector and axial vector string operators on the light - cone .",
    "namely ,    @xmath79    the `` plus '' distributions enter the electromagnetic dvcs process , and they correspond to the sum of quark and antiquark contributions , i.e. to the sum of contributions from valence quarks and twice the sea quarks . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak version of the process gives access to the `` minus '' gpds , which correspond to the difference of quark and antiquark contributions .",

    "hence the initial and final nucleon are not the same particles anymore . now the vector and axial vector string operators obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : weakchargedexpansion ] ) are accompanied by different electric charges and quark flavors .",

    "before we examine specific processes we introduce a simple model and discuss the kinematics which is common to all dvcs - like reactions . + our simple model has three properties .",
    "first we assume that the sea quark contribution is negligible , and therefore the `` plus '' gpds are equal to the `` minus '' gpds with the quark flavor @xmath85 .",
