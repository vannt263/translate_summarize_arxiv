    "reliable and accurate prediction of precipitation is of great importance in agriculture , tourism , aviation and in some other fields of economy as well . in order to represent the uncertainties of forecasts based on observational data and numerical weather prediction ( nwp ) models one can run these models with different initial conditions or change model physics , resulting in a forecast ensemble @xcite . in the last two decades",
    "this approach has became a routinely used technique all over the world and recently all major weather prediction centres have their own operational ensemble prediction systems ( eps ) , e.g. the consortium for small - scale modelling ( cosmo - de ) eps of the german meteorological service ( dwd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the prvision densemble arpege ( pearp ) eps of mteo france @xcite or the eps of the independent intergovernmental european centre for medium - range weather forecasts @xcite . with the help of a forecast ensemble one can estimate the distribution of the predictable weather quantity which opens up the door for probabilistic forecasting @xcite . by post - processing the raw ensemble the most sophisticated probabilistic methods result in full predictive cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) and correct the possible bias and underdispersion of the original forecasts .",
    "the underdispersive character of the ensemble has been observed with several ensemble prediction systems @xcite and this property also leads to the lack of calibration . using predictive cdfs one can easily get consistent estimators of probabilities of various meteorological events or calculate different prediction intervals .",
    "recently , probably the most widely used ensemble post - processing methods leading to full predictive distributions ( for an overview see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are the bayesian model averaging ( bma ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the non - homogeneous regression or ensemble model output statistics ( emos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as they are partially implemented in the ensemblebma and ensemblemos packages of r @xcite .",
    "the bma predictive probability density function ( pdf ) of the future weather quantity is the mixture of individual pdfs corresponding to the ensemble members with mixture weights determined by the relative performance of the ensemble members during a given training period . to model temperature or sea level pressure",
    "a normal mixture seems to be appropriate @xcite , wind speed requires non - negative and skewed component pdfs such as gamma @xcite or truncated normal @xcite distributions , whereas for surface wind direction a von mises distribution @xcite is suggested . however , in some situations bma post - processing might result , for instance , in model overfitting @xcite or over - weighting climatology @xcite .",
    "in contrast to bma , the emos technique uses a single parametric pdf with parameters depending on the ensemble members .",
    "again , for temperature and sea level pressure the emos predictive pdf is normal @xcite , whereas for wind speed truncated normal @xcite , generalized extreme value ( gev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , censored logistic @xcite , truncated logistic , gamma @xcite and log - normal @xcite distributions are suggested .",
    "however , statistical calibration of ensemble forecasts of precipitation is far more difficult than the post - processing of the above quantities . as pointed out by @xcite , precipitation has a discrete - continuous nature with a positive probability of being zero and larger expected precipitation amount results in larger forecast uncertainty .",
    "@xcite introduced a bma model where each individual predictive pdf consists of a discrete component at zero and a gamma distribution modelling the case of positive precipitation amounts .",
    "@xcite uses extends logistic regression to provide full probability distribution forecasts , whereas @xcite suggests an emos model based on a censored gev distribution .",
    "finally , @xcite propose a more complex three step approach where they first fit a censored and shifted gamma ( csg ) distribution model to the climatological distribution of observations , then after adjusting the forecasts to match this climatology derive three ensemble statistics , and with the help of a nonhomogeneus regression model connect these statistics to the csg model .",
    "based on the idea of @xcite we introduce a new emos approach which directly models the distribution of precipitation accumulation with a censored and shifted gamma predictive pdf .",
    "the novel emos approach is applied to 24 hour precipitation accumulation forecasts of the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble ( uwme ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the 11 member operational eps of the hungarian meteorological service ( hms ) called aire limite adaptation dynamique dvelopment international - hungary eps ( aladin - huneps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these case",
    "studies the performance of the proposed emos model is compared to the forecast skills of the gev emos method of @xcite and to the gamma bma approach of @xcite serving as benchmark models .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the emos predictive pdf of a future weather quantity is a single parametric distribution with parameters depending on the ensemble members . due to the special discrete - continuous nature of precipitation",
    "one should think only of non - negative predictive distributions assigning positive mass to the event of zero precipitation . mixing a point mass at zero and a separate non - negative distribution",
    "does the job ( see e.g. the bma model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but left censoring of an appropriate continuous distribution at zero can also be a reasonable choice .",
    "the advantage of the latter approach is that the probability of zero precipitation can directly be derived from the corresponding original ( uncensored ) cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , so the cases of zero and positive precipitation can be treated together .",
    "the emos model of @xcite utilizes a censored gev distribution with shape parameter ensuring a positive skew and finite mean , whereas our emos approach is based on a csg distribution appearing in the more complex model of @xcite .",
    "consider a gamma distribution  @xmath0  with shape  @xmath1  and scale  @xmath2  having pdf @xmath3 where  @xmath4  denotes value of the gamma function at  @xmath5 .",
    "a gamma distribution can also be parametrized by its mean  @xmath6  and standard deviation  @xmath7  using expressions @xmath8 now , let  @xmath9  and denote by  @xmath10  the cdf of the  @xmath0  distribution .",
    "then the shifted gamma distribution left censored at zero ( csg )  @xmath11  with shape  @xmath5 ,  scale  @xmath12  and shift  @xmath13  can be defined with cdf @xmath14 this distribution assigns mass  @xmath15  to the origin and has generalized pdf @xmath16 where  @xmath17  denotes the indicator function of the set  @xmath18 .",
    "short calculation shows that the mean  @xmath19  of  @xmath11  equals @xmath20 whereas the @xmath21-quantile  @xmath22  ( @xmath23 )  of equals  @xmath24  if  @xmath25 ,  and the solution of  @xmath26 ,  otherwise .",
    "now , denote by  @xmath27  the ensemble of distinguishable forecasts of precipitation accumulation for a given location and time .",
    "this means that each ensemble member can be identified and tracked , which holds for example for the uwme ( see section [ subs : subs3.1 ] ) or for the cosmo - de eps of the dwd . in the proposed csg emos model the ensemble members are linked to the mean  @xmath28  and variance  @xmath29  of the underlying gamma distribution via equations @xmath30 where  @xmath31  denotes the ensemble mean .",
    "mean parameters  @xmath32  and variance parameters  @xmath33   of model can be estimated from the training data , consisting of ensemble members and verifying observations from the preceding  @xmath34  days , by optimizing an appropriate verification score ( see section [ subs : subs2.2 ] )",
    ".    however , most of the currently used epss produce ensembles containing groups of statistically indistinguishable ensemble members which are obtained with the help of random perturbations of the initial conditions .",
    "this is the case for the aladin - huneps ensemble described in section [ subs : subs3.2 ] or for the 51 member ecmwf ensemble .",
    "the existence of several exchangeable groups is also a natural property of some multi - model epss such as the the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble @xcite or the glameps ensemble @xcite .",
    "suppose we have  @xmath35  ensemble members divided into  @xmath36  exchangeable groups , where the  @xmath5th  group contains  @xmath37  ensemble members , such that  @xmath38 .",
    "further , we denote by  @xmath39  the @xmath40th member of the @xmath5th group . in this situation ensemble members within a given group",
    "should share the same parameters @xcite resulting in the exchangeable version @xmath41 of model .",
    "note , that the expression of the mean ( or location ) as an affine function of the ensemble is general in emos post - processing ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the dependence of the variance parameter on the ensemble mean is similar to the expression of the variance in the gamma bma model of @xcite , and it is in line with the relation of forecast uncertainty to the expected precipitation amount mentioned in the introduction .",
    "moreover , practical tests show that , at least for the uwme and aladin - huneps ensemble considered in the case studies of section [ sec : sec5 ] , models and , respectively , significantly outperform the corresponding csg emos models with variance parameters @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the ensemble variance and",
    "the more robust ensemble mean difference @xcite , respectively .",
    "further , compared to the proposed models , natural modifications @xmath44 in the csg emos variance structure do not result in improved forecasts skills .",
    "the main aim of probabilistic forecasting is to access the maximal sharpness of the predictive distribution subject to calibration @xcite .",
    "the latter means a statistical consistency between the predictive distributions and the validating observations , whereas the former refers to the concentration of the predictive distribution .",
    "this goal can be addressed with the help of scoring rules which measure the predictive performance by numerical values assigned to pairs of probabilistic forecasts and observations @xcite . in atmospheric sciences the most popular scoring rules for evaluating predictive distributions are the logarithmic score , i.e. the negative logarithm of the predictive pdf evaluated at the verifying observation @xcite , and the continuous ranked probability score ( crps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a predictive cdf  @xmath45  and an observation  @xmath46  the crps is defined as @xmath47 where  @xmath48  denotes the indicator of a set  @xmath49 ,  while  @xmath50  and  @xmath51  are independent random variables with cdf  @xmath52  and finite first moment .",
    "the crps can be expressed in the same units as the observation and one should also note that both scoring rules are proper @xcite and negatively oriented , that is the smaller the better .",
    "for a csg distribution defined by the crps can be expressed in a closed form , @xcite showed that @xmath53    following the ideas of @xcite and @xcite , the parameters of models ( and as well ) are estimated by minimizing the mean crps of predictive distributions and validating observations corresponding to forecast cases of the training period .",
    "we remark that optimization with respect to the mean logarithmic score , that is , maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation of parameters , has also been investigated .",
    "obviously , in terms of crps this model can not outperform the one fit via crps minimization , however , in our test cases the ml method results in a reduction of the predictive skill of the csg emos model in terms of almost all verification scores considered , so the corresponding values are not reported .",
    "the eight - member uwme covers the pacific northwest region of north america and operates on a 12 km grid .",
    "the ensemble members are obtained from different runs of the fifth generation pennsylvania state university  national center for atmospheric research mesoscale model ( psu - ncar mm5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with initial and boundary conditions from various weather centres .",
    "we consider 48 h forecasts and corresponding validating observations of 24 h precipitation accumulation for 152 stations in the automated surface observing network @xcite in five us states .",
    "the forecasts are initialized at 0 utc ( 5 pm local time when daylight saving time ( dst ) is in use and 4 pm otherwise ) and we investigate data for calendar year 2008 with additional forecasts and observations from the last three months of 2007 used for parameter estimation . after removing days and locations with missing data",
    "83 stations remain resulting in 20522 forecast cases for 2008 .    to 9 cma ) b )    figure [ fig : fig1]a shows the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble , that is the histogram of ranks of validating observations with respect to the corresponding ensemble forecasts computed for all forecast cases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.7.2 ) , where zero observations are randomized among all zero forecasts .",
    "this histogram is far from the desired uniform distribution as in many cases the ensemble members overestimate the validating observation .",
    "the ensemble range contains the observed precipitation accumulation in @xmath54 of the cases , whereas the nominal coverage of the ensemble equals @xmath55 , i.e @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the uwme is uncalibrated , and would require statistical post - processing to yield an improved forecast probability density function .",
    "the ensemble forecasts produced by the operational aladin - huneps system of the hms are obtained with dynamical downscaling of the global pearp system of mto france by the aladin limited area model with an 8 km horizontal resolution .",
    "the eps covers a large part of continental europe and has 11 ensemble members , 10 exchangeable forecasts from perturbed initial conditions and one control member from the unperturbed analysis @xcite .",
    "the data base at hand contains ensembles of 42 h forecasts ( initialized at 18 utc , i.e. 8 pm local time when dst operates and 7 pm otherwise ) for 24 h precipitation accumulation for 10 major cities in hungary ( miskolc , sopron , szombathely , gyr , budapest , debrecen , nyregyhza , nagykanizsa , pcs , szeged ) together with the corresponding validating observations for the period between 1 october 2010 and 25 march 2011 .",
    "the data set is fairly complete since there are only two dates when three ensemble members are missing for all sites .",
    "these dates are excluded from the analysis .",
    "the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble , displayed in figure [ fig : fig1]b , shows far better calibration , than that of the uwme .",
    "the coverage of the aladin - huneps ensemble equals @xmath57 , which is very close to the nominal value of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the predictive performance of the csg emos model is tested on ensemble forecasts produced by the uwme and aladin - huneps epss , and the results are compared with the fits of the gev emos and gamma bma models investigated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and the verification scores of the raw ensemble .",
    "we remark that according to the suggestions of @xcite for estimating the parameters of the gev emos model for a given day , the estimates for the preceding day serve as initial conditions for the box constrained broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno @xcite optimization algorithm . compared with the case of fixed initial conditions this approach results in a slight increase of the forecast skills of the gev emos model , whereas for the csg emos method , at least in our case studies ,",
    "fixed initial conditions are preferred .",
    "further , we consider regional ( or global ) emos approach ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is based on ensemble forecasts and validating observations from all available stations during the rolling training period and consequently results in a single universal set of parameters across the entire ensemble domain .      to get the first insight about the calibration of emos and bma post - processed forecasts we consider probability integral transform ( pit ) histograms",
    "generally , the pit is the value of the predictive cdf evaluated at the verifying observation @xcite , however , for our discrete - continuous models in the case of zero observed precipitation a random value is chosen uniformly from the interval between zero and the probability of no precipitation @xcite",
    ". obviously , the closer the histogram to the uniform distribution , the better the calibration . in this way",
    "the pit histogram is the continuous counterpart of the verification rank histogram of the raw ensemble and provides a good measure about the possible improvements in calibration .",
    "the predictive performance of probabilistic forecasts is quantified with the help of the mean crps over all forecast cases , where for the raw ensemble the predictive cdf is replaced by the empirical one .",
    "further , as suggested by @xcite , diebold - mariano ( dm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tests are applied for investigating the significance of the differences in scores corresponding to the various post - processing methods .",
    "the dm test takes into account the dependence in the forecasts errors and for this reason it is widely used in econometrics .",
    "besides the crps we also consider brier scores ( bs ; * ? ? ? * section 8.4.2 ) for the dichotomous event that the observed precipitation amount  @xmath46  exceeds a given threshold  @xmath60 .",
    "for a predictive cdf  @xmath45  the probability of this event is  @xmath61 ,  and the corresponding brier score is given by @xmath62 see e.g. @xcite . obviously , the bs is negatively oriented and the crps is the integral of the bss over all possible thresholds . in our case studies we consider 0 mm precipitation , 5 , 15 , 25 , 30 mm and 1 , 5 , 7 , 9 mm threshold values for the uwme and aladin - huneps ensemble , respectively , corresponding approximately to the 45th , 75th , 85th and 90th percentiles of the observed non - zero precipitation accumulations , and compare the mean bss of the pairs of predictive cdfs and verifying observations over all forecast cases .",
    ".5 truecm    .@xmath21-values of kolmogorov - smirnov tests for uniformity of pit values for the uwme .",
    "means of @xmath63 random samples of sizes @xmath64 each . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     concerning the two emos approaches , the verification scores of table [ tab : tab6 ] together with the results of the corresponding dm tests for equal predictive performance ( see table [ tab : tab7 ] ) display similar behavior as in the case of the uwme .",
    "there is no significant difference between the mae values of the csg and gev emos methods and the former results in the lowest crps and the sharpest @xmath58 central prediction interval .",
    "further , the emos models significantly outperform both the raw ensemble and the gamma bma approach , despite the raw ensemble is rather well calibrated and has far better predictive skill than the bma calibrated forecast .",
    "note that the large mean crps and coverage of the bma predictive distribution is totally in line with the shape of the corresponding pit histogram of figure [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "2 mm    2 mm    2 mm    the good predictive performance of the aladin - huneps ensemble can also be observed on the large amount of negative skill scores reported in table [ tab : tab8 ] and on the reliability diagrams of figure [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "similar to the case of the uwme , for 0 mm threshold the gamma bma model has good predictive performance , whereas for higher threshold values it underperforms the csg and gev emos models and the raw ensemble .",
    "however , in connection with the reliability diagrams one should also note that the hectic behavior of the graphs ( compared to the rather smooth diagrams of figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) is a consequence of the shortage of data , as the verification period contains only 394 observations of positive precipitation , which is around one third of the forecast cases .    taking into account both the uniformity of the pit values and the verification scores in tables [ tab : tab6 ] and [ tab : tab8 ] it can be said that the proposed csg emos model has the best overall performance in calibration of the raw aladin - huneps ensemble forecasts of precipitation accumulation .",
    "a new emos model for calibrating ensemble forecasts of precipitation accumulation is proposed where the predictive distribution follows a censored and shifted gamma distribution , with mean and variance of the underlying gamma law being affine functions of the raw ensemble and the ensemble mean , respectively .",
    "the csg emos method is tested on ensemble forecasts of 24 h precipitation accumulation of the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble and on the 11 member aladin - huneps ensemble of the hungarian meteorological service .",
    "these ensemble prediction systems differ both in the climate of the covered area and in the generation of the ensemble members . by investigating the uniformity of the pit values of predictive distributions , the mean crps of probabilistic forecasts , the brier scores and reliability diagrams for various thresholds , the mae of median forecasts and the average width and coverage of central prediction intervals corresponding to the nominal coverage , the predictive skill of the new approach is compared with that of the gev emos method @xcite , the gamma bma model @xcite and the raw ensemble . from the results of the presented case studies one can conclude that in terms of calibration of probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts the proposed csg emos model significantly outperforms both the raw ensemble and the bma model and shows slightly better forecast skill than the gev emos approach .",

    "<S> the csg emos model is tested on ensemble forecasts of 24 h precipitation accumulation of the eight - member university of washington mesoscale ensemble and on the 11 member ensemble produced by the operational limited area model ensemble prediction system of the hungarian meteorological service . </S>",
    "<S> the predictive performance of the new emos approach is compared with the fit of the raw ensemble , the generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution based emos model and the gamma bma method . according to the results , </S>",
    "<S> the proposed csg emos model slightly outperforms the gev emos approach in terms of calibration of probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts and shows significantly better predictive skill that the raw ensemble and the bma model .    _ </S>",
    "<S> key words : _ continuous ranked probability score , ensemble calibration , ensemble model output statistics , gamma distribution , left censoring . </S>"
