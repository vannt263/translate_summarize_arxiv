    "nucleon couplings / cross sections from data ( measured recoil energies ) of direct dark matter detection experiments directly by taking into account a fraction of residue background events , which pass all discrimination criteria and then mix with other real wimp  induced events in the analyzed data sets .",
    "these methods require _ neither _ prior knowledge about the wimp scattering and different possible background spectra _ nor _ about the wimp mass ; the unique needed information is the recoil energies recorded in two ( or more ) direct detection experiments .",
    "i considered at first the case of a dominant sd wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction .",
    "our simulations show that , due to the contribution of non ",
    "negligible residue background events in the analyzed data sets to low / high energy ranges , the reconstructed @xmath46 ratios would be _ under-/overestimated _ ; the larger the background ratio the larger these systematic deviations of the reconstructed @xmath46 . but , by estimating the counting rates at the shifted points , instead of at the experimental minimal cut  off energies , one could ( strongly ) alleviate these systematic deviations as well as reduce the statistical uncertainties ( with non ",

    "then i turned to consider the general combination of the sd wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction with a non ",
    "negligible si one .",
    "our simulations show that , by combining three ( two spin  sensitive ) target nuclei , our method can be used to reconstruct the ratio of the sd wimp coupling on neutrons to that on protons with data sets of @xmath129 residue background events . and , more importantly , it does nt matter whether the sd wimp  nucleus cross section really dominates over the si one or not .",
    "but , the larger the relative strength between the sd wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction to the si one , the smaller the systematic deviations as well as the statistical uncertainties .",
    "i considered also the reconstruction of the ratios between the sd and si wimp  nucleon cross sections . for wimp masses , by using either the reconstructed @xmath46 ratio or a combination of a spin  sensitive nucleus with an only si ",
    "sensitive one with data sets of @xmath129 background ratios , while the @xmath147 ratio could be reconstructed with a @xmath0 30% statistical uncertainty , one could ( only ) estimate the order of magnitude of the @xmath154 ratio ( because of an statistical uncertainty ) .    moreover ,",
    "our simulations show also the wimp  mass independence of the reconstructed @xmath46 ratios with non ",
    "negligible background events , especially for wimp masses . for wimp masses @xmath130 gev , the @xmath46 ratios could be ( strongly ) _ underestimated _ , even with zero background events .",
    "however , this underestimate could be alleviated / corrected by decrease the experimental minimal cut ",
    "off energies of the analyzed date sets ( to be negligible ) .",
    "then , with data sets of @xmath129 residue background events , one could still reconstruct the @xmath46 ratios pretty well , by either assuming a dominant sd wimp interaction or using the general combination of the si and sd cross sections .",
    "but , the statistical uncertainty could be pretty large , once the sd wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction does nt dominate over the si one .",
    "furthermore , it has also been found that , firstly , by taking different assumptions about the relative strength between the si and sd wimp  nucleus interactions , and/or using different moments of the one  dimensional wimp velocity distribution function , at either the experimental minimal cut  off energies or the shifted energy points , there would be an ( in)compatibility between different reconstructed @xmath46 ratios ; with an increased background ratio , the incompatibility between the reconstructed results would become larger .",
    "hence , this ( in)compatibility could allow us to check the purity / availability of the analyzed data sets ( as well as the dominance of the si or sd wimp interaction ) .    secondly and more importantly , our simulations with a constant background spectrum indicate that , once residue background events exist regularly between the experimental minimal and maximal cut  off energies or ( even better ) ( mostly ) in high energy ranges , one could in principle estimate the counting rates of the recoil spectrum of _ only _ wimp  induced events at the experimental threshold energies ( pretty ) precisely .",
    "then the ratio between two sd wimp ",
    "nucleon couplings as well as the ratios between the sd and si wimp  nucleon cross sections could be estimated ( pretty ) precisely without worrying about the non  negligible backgrounds .    in summary , as the forth part of the study of the effects of residue background events in direct dark matter detection experiments , we considered the determinations of ratios between different wimp  nucleon couplings / cross sections .",
    "our results show that , with currently running and projected experiments using detectors with @xmath169 to @xmath170 pb sensitivities @xcite and @xmath4 background rejection ability @xcite , once two or more experiments with different _ spin  sensitive _ target nuclei could accumulate a few tens events ( in one experiment ) , we could in principle already estimate the relative strengths of couplings / cross sections of dark matter particles on ordinary matter with a reasonable precession , even though there could be some background events mixed in our data sets for analyses .",
    "moreover , although two forms for background spectrum considered in this work is rather naive , the nuclear form factors for the sd wimp interaction with different target nuclei are also more complicated as the simple thin  shell form used in our simulations , and the relative signs of the ( ratios of the ) expected / measured proton / neutron group spins of the used target nuclei could also change the reconstructed results ( to be larger or smaller , underestimated or overestimated ) , one should be able to extend our observations / discussions to predict the effects of possible background events in their own experiments .",
    "hopefully , this will not only encourage our experimental colleagues to present their ( future ) results in the parameter space of dark matter particles , but also help them to check the purity of their data sets , to understand ( residue ) background events in their experiments , as well as to improve their background discrimination techniques .",
