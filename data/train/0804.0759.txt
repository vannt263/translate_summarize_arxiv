    "it has been suggested that the processing of sensory information in the brain has adapted to the specific signal statistics of stimuli@xcite .",
    "such stimulus - specific adaptation is tantamount to taking advantage of statistical regularities in order to encode the highest possible amount of information about the signal@xcite under various constraints .",
    "the constraints include , for example , minimizing energy expenditure@xcite , minimizing wiring costs between processing units@xcite , or reducing spatial and temporal redundancies in the input signal@xcite .",
    "+ in the case of visual stimuli , natural images reveal a statistical regularity that corresponds to an approximately linear decrease of their amplitude spectra as a function of spatial frequency when scaling both coordinate axis logarithmically@xcite . this property is equivalent to strong pairwise correlations between pairs of luminance values@xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that visual neurons utilize this statistical property in a way that cells tuned to different spatial frequencies have equal sensitivities@xcite .",
    "thus , neurons tuned to high spatial frequencies should increase their response gain such that they achieve the same response levels as low frequency neurons .",
    "this is the _ response equalization hypothesis _ ( which should be distinguished from the _ decorrelation hypothesis_)@xcite .",
    "response equalization ( `` whitening '' ) may enhance the information throughput from one neuronal stage to another by adjusting the output of one stage such that it matches the limited dynamic range of the successive stage@xcite .",
    "+ the present article unveils a link between statistical properties of face images and psychophysical data for the processing of face identity .",
    "the processing of face identity was found to preferably depend on a narrow spatial frequency band ( about @xmath1 octaves ) from @xmath2 to @xmath3 cycles per face .",
    "however , to the best of my knowledge , no explanation has been offered yet of why it is that face processing mechanisms in the human brain reveal such a preference .",
    "+ here i analyzed the amplitude spectra of a large number of face images .",
    "different types of amplitude spectra were considered - with and without suppression of external face features ( hair , shoulders , etc . ) .",
    "the spectra were whitened ( i.e. , `` response''-equalized ) according to three different procedures . in this way it is demonstrated that the main results are largely independent of the specific method that was used for whitening :",
    "amplitudes were higher at spatial frequencies around @xmath4 cycles per face - but only in those spectra where external face features were suppressed .",
    "therefore , the effect must have been produced by internal face features ( eyes , mouth , nose ) .",
    "# 1    [ cols=\"^,^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      amplitude spectra are best conceived in polar coordinates , where the spatial frequency @xmath5 varies proportional to radius .",
    "thus , spectral amplitudes which have the same spatial frequency lie on a circle .",
    "the 2-d spectrum can be collapsed into an 1-d isotropic spectrum for each @xmath5 by averaging all amplitudes on that circle .",
    "this means that in an isotropic spectrum any orientation dependence of the amplitudes is lost .",
    "+ the amplitude spectra of _ natural _ images were found to depend on spatial frequency as @xmath6 , with an average ( isotropic ) spectral slope @xmath7@xcite .",
    "+ how do the amplitude spectra of face images compare to this finding ? to answer , i computed slopes of the amplitude spectra of @xmath8 female and @xmath8 male face images ( size @xmath9 ) . in a double - logarithmic representation ,",
    "these spectra also decreased approximately linear as a function of spatial frequency ( ) .",
    "therefore a line with ( spectral ) slope @xmath10 could be fitted to each spectrum .",
    "four different types of amplitude spectra were considered for each face image ( with different @xmath10 , see table [ slopetable ] and methods section ) .",
    "+ at first the spectra of the original images were computed (  raw ) .",
    "the second type of spectrum is defined by attenuating in each spectrum the truncation artifacts ( `` corr .",
    "raw '' , and ) .",
    "these artifacts are a consequence of the cropped shoulder region being displayed in each image besides the actual face . to smoothly strip off external face features ( like the hair , i.e. anything but the actual face ) ,",
    "a blackman - harris window was applied to each image prior to computing its spectrum ( `` blackman - harris '' or `` b.h . ''  see ) . because application of the b.h .- window leaves a faint but characteristic spectral `` fingerprint '' ( ) , a further spectrum type ( `` corr .",
    ") was considered , with the artificial `` fingerprint '' being attenuated .",
    "+ the mean isotropic slope values were computed in two ways .",
    "first , the spectral slope of each face image was computed , and individual slope values were averaged ( label _ `` slopes '' _ in table [ slopetable ] ) .",
    "second , an average spectrum is computed at first , which is composed of all individual spectra ( see ) .",
    "the second slope value corresponds then to the slope of the average spectrum ( label _ `` spectra '' _ in table [ slopetable ] ) .",
    "isotropic slope values are situated around @xmath11 , with minima and maxima of @xmath12 & @xmath13 ( females ) , respectively , and @xmath14 & @xmath15 ( males ) .",
    "+ notice that the standard deviations associated with the slopes of arbitrary natural images are usually bigger@xcite , as there is no restriction on displayed content and scale , respectively@xcite .",
    "+    usually , @xmath10 varies also as a function of orientation @xmath16@xcite .",
    "the orientation dependence is illustrated by means of the averaged corrected spectra ( ) .",

    "spectra , minimum slopes are associated with the orientations of the internal face features ( @xmath19 : nose ; @xmath20 : eyes , mouth , and the bottom termination of the nose ) .",
    "+ summarizing so far , the majority of the individual @xmath10 for face images is more negative than the theoretically predicted lower bound of @xmath21 for natural images@xcite ( table [ slopetable ] ; ) .",
    "similar observations also hold for spectral slopes of the mean amplitude spectra ( ) .",
    "this should not come as a surprise since the structure of face images is different from natural images : face images are not composed of self - occluding , constant intensity surface patches@xcite , and lack the self - similar distribution of spectral energy as it was reported for natural images@xcite .      here",
    "i ask whether by amplitude equalization of amplitude spectra ( `` whitening '' ) one could explain psychophysical data on face perception .",
    "the results which are presented below were obtained with the mean spectra .",
    "+ consider first the isotropic ( 1-d ) spectra . because the spectra fall , as a function of spatial frequency @xmath5 , as @xmath22 , we can multiply amplitudes by @xmath23 to obtain a `` flat '' spectrum ( in the sense that its shannon entropy is maximal ) .",
    "the slopes which were used to this end are the _",
    "`` spectra '' _ ones from table [ slopetable ] .",
    "whitened 1-d spectra are shown in .",
    "they are not completely flat , but instead have a global maximum at around @xmath4 cycles per face , and a second but local maximum at around @xmath24 cycles per face .",
    "+ consider now the 2-d spectra , where whitening was carried out according to three different procedures : whitening by _ slopes _",
    "( analogous to the 1-d case ) , by _ variance _ , and by _ diffusion _ ( see methods section ) .",
    "results are shown in for females , and in for males .",
    "for both genders , the whitened b.h .- spectra reveal amplitude maxima only within a narrow band of low spatial frequencies .",
    "furthermore , frequency maxima appear only at a specific orientation in the spectra which corresponds to horizontally oriented face features ( `` horizontal amplitudes '' , i.e. eyes and mouth ) .",
    "these results are obtained independently from the specific whitening procedure which was used ( _ slope_-whitening : & ; _ variance_-whitening : ; _ diffusion_-whitening : not shown ) .",
    "+ plotting of only these `` horizontal amplitudes '' ( indicated by a white box in ) for all three whitening procedures allows to identify the spatial frequencies of the maxima with higher precision .",
    "the curves now show clearly that the maxima occur in the range from @xmath4 to @xmath25 cycles per face height .",
    "nevertheless , maxima are only revealed by whitening of the b.h .- windowed spectra , but not by whitening of any raw spectra .",
    "this means that amplitude enhancement due to internal face features is annihilated by the presence of external face features ( such as hair or shoulder ) .",
    "here , i studied amplitude spectra of face images in the context of response equalization ( whitening ) . were external face features ( hair , shoulder ) suppressed by windowing the face images with a blackman - harris window ,",
    "then amplitude maxima are observed in the whitened spectra at low spatial frequencies . for the isotropic 1-d spectra ,",
    "maxima are situated around @xmath4 cycles per face , and for the 2-d spectra at around @xmath26 cycles per face height . in the 2-d case ,",
    "three different whitening methods yielded consistent results .",
    "+ several psychophysical studies suggest that recognition of face identity works _",
    "best _ in a narrow band ( bandwidth about @xmath1 octaves ) of spatial frequencies from @xmath27 to @xmath28 cycles per face .",
    "notice that this does not mean that face recognition exclusively depends on this frequency band , as faces can still be recognized when corresponding frequency information is suppressed@xcite .",
    "+ because the amplitude maxima appear in the whitened spectra exclusively at horizontal feature orientations , my results suggest that the psychophysical frequency preference might have been caused by an adaptation of corresponding neuronal mechanisms to eyes and mouth .",
    "+ interestingly , in the earlier cited psychophysical studies the spatial frequencies are often measured in `` cycles per face width '' ( i.e. , along vertically oriented face features ) , whereas the results presented here were rather brought about by horizontally oriented face features . the factors to convert spatial frequencies from `` cycles per image '' to `` cycles per face '' ( see methods ) are statistically different for width and height ( as suggested by a one - way anova and a kruskal - wallis test ) .",
    "however , they are not so different in absolute terms .",
    "the aforementioned frequency interval of @xmath26 _ cycles per face height _ transforms into @xmath29 _",
    "cycles per face width _ for females and @xmath30 _ cycles per face width _ for males , respectively , what is still in good agreement with the psychophysical data .",
    "+ psychophysical thresholds for face recognition are not significantly affected by the structure of the background in which a face is embedded@xcite .",
    "therefore , although the faces used in this study are shown against an uniform background , the validity of results should extend to arbitrary backgrounds .",
    "notice , however , that amplitude spectra consider the complete frequency content of an image , whereas humans have attentional mechanisms which allows them to process only a region of interest , and ignore background effects . windowing the face images with a blackman - harris window achieves the the same computational purpose : anything but the internal face features are suppressed .",
    "a follow - up paper examines in more detail the properties of internal face features by means of a model of simple and complex cells .",
    "+ the statistical prediction of a preferred band of spatial frequencies may also have implications for artificial face recognition systems .",
    "future experiments should systematically address the question whether the recognition performance of artificial systems is optimal at spatial frequencies similar to those used by humans .",

    "original images ( @xmath31 pixels , 24-bit true color ) were adjusted for horizontal alignment of eyes , before they were down - sampled to @xmath9 pixels and converted into 8-bit grey - scale .",
    "subsequently , the positions of left eye , right eye , and mouth [ @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively ] were manually marked by two persons ( m.s.k . and e.c . ) with an _ ad hoc _ programmed graphical interface .",
    "the position of each face center ( @xmath35 nose ) was approximated as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes rounding to the nearest integer value .",
    "[ spatialfrequencyconversion ] for conversion of spatial frequency units , face dimensions were manually marked with an _ ad hoc _ programmed graphical interface .",

    "corresponding factors for obtaining `` cycles per face height '' were @xmath42 ( females ) and @xmath43 ( males ) .",
    "conversion factors at oblique orientations were calculated under the assumption that horizontal and vertical conversion factors define the two main axis of an ellipse .",
    "pooling of results over gender implied also a corresponding averaging of conversion factors , and the factors for width and height were averaged in the isotropic case .",
    "[ amplitude_spectra ] let the features which are not part of the actual face be denoted by _ external features _ ( e.g. , shoulder region or hair ) . on the other hand , _ internal features _",
    "refer to the eyes , the mouth , and the nose .",
    "the presence of external features in our face images influences in their amplitude spectra , and may cause truncation artifacts .",
    "it is thus desirable to compare results with and without the presence of external features .",
    "a good suppression of external features could be achieved by centering a _ _ minimum 4-term blackman - harris window__@xcite at @xmath44 ( & ) .",
    "nevertheless , application of the window leaves a characteristic `` fingerprint '' in each spectrum ( ) . this artificial `` fingerprint '' , as well as the spurious lines caused by truncation , could be attenuated with a correction procedure based on a spatially varying diffusion mechanism ( outlined below ) .",
    "thus , for each face image , originally four types of amplitude spectra were considered : the original `` raw '' spectrum , the `` blackman - harris''-spectrum , and their respective corrected versions ( i.e. , `` corr .",
