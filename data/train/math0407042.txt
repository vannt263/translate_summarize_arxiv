    "according to steinitz paper @xcite from 1906 , the cone spanned by the @xmath3-vectors of @xmath6-dimensional polytopes ( with apex at the @xmath3-vector of the @xmath6-simplex ) is given by @xmath7 in conjunction with euler s formula , @xmath8 ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the cone of flag vectors of @xmath6-polytopes is also given by these two inequalities , together with the usual dehn ",
    "sommerville relations , such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here",
    "the extreme cases , polytopes whose @xmath3- or flag vectors lie at the boundary of the cone , are given by the simplicial polytopes ( for which steinitz first inequality is tight ) and the simple polytopes ( second inequality tight ) .",
    "moreover , _ all _ the integer points that satisfy the above conditions do correspond to actual polytopes .    for @xmath1-dimensional polytopes ,",
    "such a complete and simple answer is not to be expected ; compare grnbaum ( * ? ? ?",
    "10.4 ) , bayer @xcite and hppner & ziegler @xcite",
    ". however , we may now be getting close to a full description of the convex cone spanned by the @xmath3-vectors ( with apex at the @xmath3-vector of the @xmath1-simplex ) : in the projective coordinates introduced in  @xcite , @xmath11 we can write the known necessary conditions as @xmath12 where the first two conditions are trivial , the second two have simplicial resp .  simple polytopes as extreme cases , and the last condition is a lower bound that follows from `` @xmath13 . '' this is indeed a complete description of the cone if and only if there are polytopes for which the sum @xmath14 is arbitrarily small , that is , for which the _ fatness _ parameter @xmath15 is arbitrarily large @xcite .",
    "this observation has sparked a certain race for `` fat '' @xmath1-dimensional polytopes .",
    "the following table summarizes the main steps .",
    "most of the examples that appear there are 2-simple and 2-simplicial , with a symmetric @xmath3-vector ; the first infinite family of such polytopes was constructed by eppstein , kuperberg & ziegler @xcite ; a simple construction appears in paffenholz & ziegler @xcite .",
    "we call a polytope `` even '' if its graph is bipartite . @xmath16 } & 5.048 & 2-simple , 2-simplicial   &                                           eppstein et al.\\ \\cite{z80 } & 2003\\\\ $ e(c_m\\times c_n)$ & $ 6-{\\varepsilon}$ & 2-simple , 2-simplicial   &                                      paffenholz \\cite{paffenholz - pc } & 2004\\\\ projected products & $ 9-{\\varepsilon}$ & even        & here & \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] a flag vector parameter that is similar to fatness , called _ complexity _ , was also introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this is an invariant of the flag vector , defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are components of the toric @xmath20-vector of the polytope , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer to @xmath20-entries of the dual polytope ; compare @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "all @xmath1-polytopes satisfy @xmath23 .",
    "fatness and complexity are roughly within a factor of  @xmath0 : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in particular , it is not known whether @xmath26 can be arbitrarily large . previously , the polytopes with the largest known complexity were the `` neighborly cubical polytopes '' of joswig & ziegler @xcite , of complexity @xmath27 . our present construction yields `` neighborly cubical polytopes '' in the special case @xmath28 ( possibly special cases of those of @xcite , with a simpler description ) , but for @xmath29 it yields complexity values as large as @xmath30 .",
    "the concept of `` strictly preserving a face '' used in the following theorem will be explained in section  [ sec : projections ] .",
    "( compare the concept of faces in the `` shadow boundary '' of a projection , e.g.  in  @xcite . )",
    "[ thm : ppp ] let @xmath31 be even and @xmath32 .",
    "then there is a @xmath33-polytope @xmath34 , combinatorially equivalent to a product of @xmath35 @xmath36-gons , @xmath37 , such that the projection @xmath38 to the last four coordinates preserves the @xmath39-skeleton as well as all the `` @xmath36-gon @xmath0-faces '' of @xmath40 .    in the following ,",
    "we describe in brief the main ingredients for the construction and sketch the proof for its correctness .",
    "detailed proofs , the complete combinatorial characterization of the resulting polytopes , possible extensions , further remarkable aspects ( such as the polyhedral surfaces of high genus embedded in the @xmath0-skeleta of the resulting @xmath1-polytopes ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) as well as necessity of the restrictions imposed here ( e.g. , that @xmath36 must be even ) are topics of current research and will be presented later .      the intuition for the construction given here grew from previous joint work and current discussions with nina amenta , michael joswig , and thilo schrder .",
    "the combinatorial structure of the products of polygons @xmath41 is easy to describe : these are simple @xmath33-polytopes , with @xmath42 vertices , @xmath43 edges , and @xmath44 facets . in general , its non - empty faces are products of non - empty faces of the polygons , so @xmath45 the @xmath0-dimensional faces of  @xmath41 , and thus of any polytope combinatorially equivalent to  @xmath41 , may be split into two classes : there are @xmath46 faces that are @xmath36-gons , which we refer to _ polygons _ , which arise as products of one of the @xmath36-gons with a vertex from each of the other factors ; and there are @xmath47 _ quadrilaterals _ that ( in @xmath41 ) arise as products of edges from two of the factors with vertices from the others .",
    "thus , in total @xmath41 has @xmath48 @xmath0-faces .    in the case",
    "@xmath28 , the polygon @xmath0-faces of @xmath41 are @xmath1-gons , but we nevertheless treat the @xmath49 polygons and the @xmath50 quadrilaterals separately in this case .    an inequality description for such a product polytope may be obtained as @xmath51 assuming that @xmath52 is a correct description for an @xmath36-gon : for this it is necessary and sufficient that the row vectors @xmath53 of @xmath54 are non - zero and distinct and that they positively span  @xmath55 , that the components @xmath56 of  @xmath57 are positive , and that the rescaled vectors @xmath58 are in convex position ( the vertices of the polar of the polygon ) .    for this",
    "we say that a finite set of vectors @xmath59 _ positively spans _ if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions :    every vector @xmath60 is a linear combination of the vectors @xmath53 , with non - negative coefficients ,    every vector @xmath60 is a linear combination of the vectors @xmath53 , with positive coefficients ,    the vectors @xmath53 span @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is a linear combination of the vectors @xmath53 , with positive coefficients ( that is , the vectors @xmath53 are _ positively dependent _ ) .    in the following , we will need `` deformed products '' ( as described in amenta & ziegler @xcite ) of polygons . for this",
    ", we look at systems of the form @xmath63 given any such left - hand side matrix for such a system , we can adapt the right - hand side so that the resulting polytope is _ combinatorially equivalent _ to  @xmath41 : for this all components of @xmath64 have to be sufficiently large compared to @xmath65 , for @xmath66 .",
    "( compare @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "we work with a rather restrictive concept of faces `` being preserved under projection . ''",
    "[ def : strictly]let @xmath67 be a projection of polytopes . then a face @xmath68 is _ strictly preserved _",
    "if    its image @xmath69 is a face of  @xmath70 ,    the map @xmath71 is a bijection , and    the pre - image of the image is @xmath72 , that is , @xmath73 .    in the definition ,",
    "conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) are both needed .",
    "indeed , in the projection `` to the second coordinate '' displayed in our figure , the vertex @xmath74 is strictly preserved , but the vertex  @xmath75 and the edge @xmath76 are not : for @xmath75 condition ( iii ) fails , while for @xmath76 condition ( ii ) is violated .",
    "@xmath77    for simplicity , the following characterization result is given only in a coordinatized version , for the projection `` to the last @xmath78 coordinates . ''",
    "we say that a vector @xmath79 _ defines _ the face @xmath68 given by all the points of @xmath80 that have maximal scalar product with @xmath79 .",
    "this describes exactly all the vectors in the relative interior of the _ normal cone _ of  @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath80 is full - dimensional , this interior of the normal cone consists of all the positive combinations of outer facet normals @xmath81 to the facets @xmath82 that contain  @xmath72 .",
    "( compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sects .  2.1 , 3.2 , 7.1 ) . )",
    "[ prop : preserve]let @xmath83 , @xmath84 be the projection to the last  @xmath78 coordinates , and let @xmath85 be an @xmath86-dimensional polytope , and let @xmath72 be a face of  @xmath80 .",
    "then the following three conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath72 is strictly preserved by the projection @xmath87 .",
    "any @xmath88 arises as the first @xmath76 components of a vector @xmath89 that defines  @xmath72 .",
    "the vectors @xmath90 , given by the first @xmath76 components of the normal vectors @xmath91 to facets @xmath92 of  @xmath80 that contain @xmath72 , positively span @xmath93 .    here",
    "we only establish `` @xmath94 , '' which is used in the following .",
    "if the vectors @xmath90 are positively dependent , then some positive combination of the vectors @xmath91 yields @xmath95 .",
    "a point @xmath96 lies in the face @xmath68 if and only if its scalar product with each facet normal @xmath97 is maximal .",
    "this happens if and only if @xmath98 is maximal , that is , iff @xmath99 is maximal under the restriction @xmath100 .",
    "thus we have established that under the assumption ( 3 ) , @xmath101 is a face of  @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ; that is , conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) of definition  [ def : strictly ] are satisfied .    since the vectors @xmath104 additionally are positively spanning , we know that if @xmath105 , then @xmath106 for @xmath107 : every such @xmath108 arises as a positive combination of the vectors @xmath104 , and since the scalar product with the corresponding combination of the @xmath109 is maximized over @xmath80 at @xmath110 , a scalar product with @xmath111 will be larger than the maximum over  @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that the projection @xmath112 is injective .",
    "in particular @xmath71 is injective , and this establishes part  ( ii ) of definition  [ def : strictly ] .",
    "for @xmath31 even and @xmath32 , let @xmath40 be defined by the linear inequality system @xmath113 here the left - hand side coefficient matrix @xmath114 contains blocks of size @xmath115 , where @xmath116 with @xmath117 the block @xmath118 arises from @xmath54 by an @xmath119-perturbation : @xmath120 for a sufficiently small @xmath121 .",
    "all entries of @xmath122 outside the @xmath123 blocks of types @xmath118 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are zero .",
    "let the right - hand side vector be such that @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 for even @xmath128 , and @xmath129 for odd  @xmath128 , and by @xmath130 for sufficiently large @xmath131",
    ".    then @xmath40 has the properties claimed by theorem  [ thm : ppp ] .",
    "in particular , it is a deformed product of @xmath35 @xmath36-gons , and all its polygon @xmath0-faces survive the projection to the last @xmath1 coordinates .",
    "the rows @xmath132 of @xmath118 are indeed in cyclic order : @xmath133 moreover , rescaled as @xmath134 for odd  @xmath128 and as @xmath135 for even @xmath128 they are in convex position , if @xmath119 is small ; so @xmath136 defines a convex @xmath36-gon .",
    "thus for sufficiently small @xmath119 and sufficiently large  @xmath131 , the polytope @xmath137 is indeed a deformed product of polygons , as discussed in section  [ sec : products ] .",
    "now we show that for sufficiently small @xmath119 , all the polygon @xmath0-faces of @xmath40 survive the projection to the last @xmath1 coordinates . for this",
    ", we verify that the left - hand side matrix with @xmath54-blocks instead of @xmath118-blocks , which we denote by @xmath138 , satisfies the linear algebra condition dictated by proposition  [ prop : preserve](3 ) .",
    "this is sufficient , since the `` positively spanning '' condition is stable under perturbation by a small  @xmath119 .",
    "any polygon @xmath0-face @xmath72 of the simple @xmath33-polytope @xmath139 is defined by the facet normals to the @xmath140 facets that contain  @xmath72 .",
    "the facet normals correspond to the rows of the inequality system , and thus for the facet normals of a polygon @xmath0-face one has to choose two cyclically adjacent rows from each block ( corresponding to a vertex from each factor polygon ) , except from one of the blocks no row is taken .",
    "moreover , due to the structure of the matrices @xmath125 , @xmath54 , and @xmath124 , in which rows alternate , any choice of two cyclically - adjacent rows from a block yields the same pair of rows ( only the order is not clear , but it also does not matter ) .",
    "thus , to apply proposition  [ prop : preserve](3 ) we have to show :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if one of the @xmath35 pairs of rows is deleted from the reduced matrix @xmath141 then the remaining @xmath140 rows + ( a )  span @xmath142 , and + ( b )  have a linear dependence with strictly positive coefficients . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    let us establish ( b ) first . for this , let @xmath143 these sequences are designed to be non - negative , @xmath144 for all @xmath145 , with equality only for @xmath146 .",
    "thus for ( b ) it suffices to verify    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for any @xmath147 , the rows of @xmath148 are positively dependent with coefficients @xmath149 for the even - index row from the @xmath150-th block , and @xmath151 for the odd - index row from the @xmath150-th block . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    since the ( two ) vectors in the @xmath150-th block thus get zero coefficients , so they may be deleted from any linear dependence ( with otherwise positive coefficients ) .",
    "thus we are led to the condition @xmath152 which is needed to hold for @xmath153 , but which we impose for all @xmath145 .",
    "the choice of vectors @xmath154 is designed to satisfy this condition .",
    "indeed , except for the choice of a basis , which we took to be @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the configuration of five vectors @xmath154 are uniquely determined by the condition .    for property ( a ) , we have to show that if one of the @xmath35 pairs of rows is deleted from the matrix @xmath148 , then the resulting matrix still has full rank .",
    "if the first or the second pair of rows is deleted , then we still have the last @xmath157 rows , and they form a block upper triangular matrix , which has full rank since its diagonal block @xmath158 is non - singular . if a later pair of rows is deleted , then we are faced with the task to show that the @xmath159 matrices @xmath160 of the form @xmath161 are non - singular . to verify this ( without proving explicitly that @xmath162 , which might need combinatorial ingenuity ) we use our knowledge about row combinations of @xmath160 .",
    "indeed , if we sum the rows of @xmath160 with coefficients @xmath163 , then this will result in the linear combination of the three rows of the matrix @xmath164 with the coefficients @xmath165 , since @xmath166 .",
    "similarly , if we sum the rows of @xmath160 with coefficients @xmath167 , then we get a linear combination of the same three rows , with coefficients @xmath168 . and",
    "if we use coefficients @xmath169 to sum the rows of @xmath160 , then the result will be a sum with coefficients @xmath170 .",
    "the coefficient matrix @xmath171 is non - singular for @xmath172 : its determinant is @xmath173 .",
    "thus the full row - space of @xmath174 is contained in the row space of @xmath160 . in particular , we find the unit vectors @xmath175 in the row space of @xmath174 , and thus of @xmath160 , and this allows us to complete the argument by induction .",
    "[ cor : flag ] the @xmath1-polytope @xmath176 has the flag vector @xmath177    we obtain @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the products @xmath41 , which are simple @xmath33-polytopes with @xmath178 vertices . with the abbreviation @xmath179 this yields @xmath180 vertices and @xmath181 edges for @xmath176 .",
    "the projected polytope has two types of facets : there are `` prism '' facets , which involve two of the polygons , as well as `` cube '' facets , which in @xmath41 arise as products of three edges and @xmath183 vertices , but contain no polygon @xmath0-faces .",
    "thus each prism facet is bounded by two polygons , and each polygon lies in two prism facets .",
