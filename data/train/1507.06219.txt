    "organized wholesale electricity markets are increasingly replacing vertically integrated systems around the world .",
    "these markets attempt to balance the objectives of short term stability and performance with economic competitiveness , efficiency , and long term planning ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "their structure is designed to take into account the unique properties of electricity among commodities : ( i ) it currently can not be economically stored , so supply and demand must be continually balanced , ( ii ) injections into the transmission network flow according to kirchhoff s laws , not from point to point , ( iii ) the transmission network has finite capacity and many operating constraints which limit the size of injections and withdrawals at specific locations , and ( iv ) the amount of power demanded is typically insensitive to price over short time periods .",
    "in particular , these properties can lead to situations in which the network becomes segmented into effectively separate regions , meaning that some producers can not competitively sell energy at certain locations . this segmentation is usually called transmission congestion , and can lead to large inefficiencies and costs to consumers . the standard approach",
    "to dealing with the above is to use a spatial and temporal pricing mechanism that explicitly accounts for the physical and operating constraints on the transmission network and generation units ( @xcite ) . in this approach , prices at various locations in the transmission network , which are called locational marginal prices ( lmps ) , are determined with the objective of maximizing social welfare while taking into account all physical and operating constraints , and compensating production and transmission providers for the marginal costs of their services .",
    "these prices exhibit a very rich structure : they are high frequency , non - stationary , very seasonal , very volatile at times of peak demand and supply shortages , and fat tailed . from many points of view , such as financial risk management , market efficiency , mitigating market power , as well as short and long term planning , it is therefore important to understand the structure and predictability of these prices ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the fluctuations in the most volatile component of lmps exhibits multi - scaling behaviour and high generalized hurst exponent values .",
    "in addition , we study the forecast error of simple linear forecasting models , and how this is related to the generalized hurst exponent .",
    "in section [ sec : data ] we discuss the structure of the available data and its properties . in section [ sec : analysis ] we study the seasonality properties of the prices and the multi - scaling behaviour by using the generalized hurst exponent approach . in section [ sec : linmod ] we connect the properties of the generalized hurst exponent to the forecast error of a linear predictive model .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the electricity markets in the united states have adopted what is known as a multi - settlement structure .",
    "market participants freely make bids and offers for electricity at different locations in the transmission network which are fed into a centrally organized dispatch and scheduling system administered by an independent authority , often called an independent system operator ( iso ) .",
    "this bidding and dispatch is managed in a set of successive runs .",
    "the first run , performed a day in advance of an operating day , is called the day - ahead ( da ) market . using the da bids , the iso establishes a generation and load schedule and da lmps for each hour of the operating day , at each location ( often called node ) of the network .",
    "the da market exists to help participants and the iso plan ahead , increase market liquidity , and mitigate market power ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , as each hour of the operating day approaches , a real - time ( rt ) energy market is administered based on revised generation offers and load forecast .",
    "this process results in new hourly rt lmps at each node .",
    "rt lmps are much more volatile than da lmp s due to changes in fuel costs , unanticipated demand that must be met in real time by existing capacity , as well as planned and unplanned generation and transmission outages .    in more technical terms ,",
    "the lmp at some node is the marginal cost ( expressed in $ /mwh ) of supplying , at the lowest cost , the next increment of demand at that node , while taking into account supply and demand and the physical and operational constraints of the transmission network . for each node",
    "@xmath5 the da or rt lmp at time @xmath6 can be split into three components ( @xcite ) : @xmath7 where mec is the _ marginal electricity component _ , mlc is the _ marginal loss component _ , and mcc stands for _ marginal congestion component_. the @xmath8 component is the price of electricity at any given node if there is no congestion or loss to that node .",
    "@xmath9 is the cost of transmission losses to a node , and is generally small in comparison with @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 component is of particular interest to us : it is related to the congestion occurring in the transmission network and is the most volatile time series in rt and da , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] for a particular node in the miso market .    for our study",
    "we focus on the da mcc component of price from two markets : the midwest independent system operator ( miso ) and pennsylvania - new jersey - maryland interconnection ( pjm ) , for a period of time of 1632 hours , starting january 1 , 2014 and ending march 9 , 2014 .",
    "there are 1287 nodes for pjm and 2568 nodes in miso .",
    "given the fact that lmps are strongly influenced by the local and regional climates and supply and demand patterns , one could ask whether there are any cyclic patterns in lmps , and if this influences the predictability of the time series ( @xcite ) .    for this purpose , we study the discrete fourier transform ( computed with a fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm ) of the time series of prices @xmath12 at each node @xmath13 , from the pjm and miso markets . in fig . [",
    "fig : powerspectrumfft ] we plot the power spectrum of each time series , defined as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , evaluated over the whole time range and averaged over all nodes in the market .",
    "the value in each bin @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of nodes in the market .",
    "one can observe the presence of several peaks in the power spectrum , which one can identify respectively as 24h , 12h and 8h cyclic patterns ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these components have a larger size than the rest of the spectrum .        in order to investigate the properties of the fluctuations of the prices ,",
    "we next analyze the scaling properties using a hurst exponent approach ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the hurst exponent and its generalizations",
    "have been used to study financial market behaviours ( for an introduction see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "its importance has been stressed in the last decade in a series of papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and it has been used as a tool for quantifying the different degree of development and efficiency of various financial markets ( @xcite ) .",
    "multi - scaling has been investigated also through de - trended fluctuation analysis ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we use the generalized hurst exponent ( ghe ) approach .     in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexp ] ) for pjm ( left ) and miso ( right ) .",

    "this figure shows that in miso market the multi - fractal behaviour is more pronounced than in pjm.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the ghe is a tool used to study the statistical and scaling properties of time series .",
    "the scaling is characterized by an exponent @xmath0 which is commonly associated with the long - term statistical dependence of the series .",
    "it is defined from the scaling of the q - th order moments of the distribution of increments ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath21 where the time interval @xmath22 can vary between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the cumulative sum of the time series of interest @xmath26 , and @xmath23 is the sampling rate .    within this framework , two kinds of processes can be distinguished : ( i ) a process where @xmath27 is constant and independent of @xmath28 ; and ( ii ) a process with @xmath0 not constant .",
    "the first case is characteristic of uni - scaling or uni - fractal processes and the scaling behaviour is determined from a unique constant @xmath29 that coincides with the hurst coefficient or the self - affine index .",
    "this is the case for self - affine processes where @xmath30 is linear ( @xmath27 ) and fully determined by its index @xmath29 . in the second case ,",
    "when @xmath0 depends on @xmath28 , the process is commonly called multi - scaling ( or multi - fractal ) and different exponents characterize the scaling of different @xmath28-moments of the distribution . the hurst exponent is related with the the scaling behavior observed in power spectra @xmath31 by @xmath32 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was noticed in ( @xcite ) that the hurst exponents evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexp ] ) do not strongly depend on the choice of detrending procedure used on the time series or on @xmath22 if this is taken sufficiently large .",
    "for the present paper we have verified that using detrendings over time windows of size @xmath33 $ ] hours , the changes of the values of the hurst exponents were consistently below 10% .",
    "we analyze the values of the hurst exponents for the pjm and miso cumulative time series i.e. , we evaluate the hurst exponent on @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the da mcc prices .",
    "this approach is justified by the fact that in the day - ahead market , participants place bids one day ahead for each hour , and thus the cumulative sum of the time series is the real return as a function of time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : multifract ] we show the multi - scaling behavior in these markets by plotting the average quantity @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexp ] ) ( dark line ) together with the shaded area representing the standard deviation , and observing that these curves are below their linear trend .",
    "[ fig : multifract ] shows that prices in both markets exhibit strong multi - fractal behaviour , although this phenomenon is more pronounced in miso .",
    "these results are in line with ( @xcite ) for the case of north - european electricity markets , and can be attributed to the fact that electricity is not economically storable .    a snapshot of the distribution of the hurst exponent @xmath35 is shown in fig .

    "the average is taken over the nodes @xmath13 in the market , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "see ( @xcite ) for a similar analysis performed on stock market data .",
    "the use of a short time window with @xmath45 hours will be further motivated in the next section , where we will suggest the use of this training window to minimize forecast errors .",
    "it is also interesting to note that even if evaluated on such a short window , the values of these exponents appear to be in the same ranges as those evaluated on the whole time series .    for both pjm and miso , the hurst exponent is subject to rather strong fluctuations and spiky behaviour .",
    "we note that the latter is rather attenuated when we consider the signal from which the cyclic components have been removed , but still the hurst exponents oscillate in the range @xmath48 and @xmath49 for both markets , which confirms the persistence of the fluctuations .",
    "even after the signal has been filtered , we note that some abrupt transitions occur for both @xmath35 and @xmath40 .",

    "for instance , in the case of pjm , the sharp transition occurring at @xmath50h corresponds to a severe snowfall occurring in pennsylvania on the 5th of february 2014 .",

    ". our focus will be on applying the generalized hurst exponent method for forecasting purposes . in order to do so",

    "<S> we empirically analyze the most volatile component of the electricity price time series from two north - american wholesale electricity markets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these time series exhibit fluctuations which are not described by a brownian motion , as they show multi - scaling , high hurst exponents and sharp price movements . </S>",
    "<S> we use the generalized hurst exponent ( ghe , @xmath0 ) to show that although these time - series have strong cyclical components , the fluctuations exhibit persistent behaviour , i.e. , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effectiveness of the ghe as a predictive tool in a simple linear forecasting model , and study the forecast error as a function of @xmath0 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the ghe can be used as prediction tool for these time series when the hurst exponent is dynamically evaluated on rolling time windows of size @xmath4 hours . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also compared to the case in which the cyclical components have been subtracted from the time series , showing the importance of cyclicality in the prediction power of the hurst exponent .    </S>",
