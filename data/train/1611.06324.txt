    "the transport properties of active or self - propelled particles have received particular attention over the past several years . on the one hand , physicists , both theoreticians and experimentalists ,",
    "have found a fertile ground to probe and explore ideas regarding the out - of - equilibrium conditions at which active motion occurs . on the other , there are potential applications for the designing and/or controlling the self - propulsion mechanisms which would make possible to manipulate the diffusive properties of such particles at will @xcite .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium element of active systems relies undoubtedly on the single - particle mechanism that give rise to self - propulsion .",
    "such a mechanisms , breaks the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite , which otherwise characterizes the motion of passive brownian particles by linking in a direct way , the diffusion properties of the particle to the temperature of the surrounding fluid . in practice , the detailed microscopic dynamics of the self - propelling mechanism occurs at a smaller time scales than the corresponding one of the observed pattern of motion .",
    "this time - scales disparity allows us to employ a reductionist approach for which the complexity of the self - propelling mechanism can be simplified .",
    "such simplification considers the over - damped dynamics for time evolution of the particle s speed , so one can assume that the particle moves at constant speed over a coarse - scale of time at which the pattern of motion is described ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for instance ) .",
    "this approximation is well supported by experimental studies in many real biological systems @xcite where fluctuations around the average value are small .    in regards to the study of pattern of motion observed in active systems ,",
    "two wide lines of research can be identified , on the one hand , there has been a great interest on the emergent patterns of collective motion of collections of a large number of interacting self - propelled particles .",
    "indeed collections of self - propelled particles are ubiquitous in nature , from micro- to macro - organisms in biology @xcite and more recently in man - made systems where micron - sized particles self - propel by conversion of chemical energy into mechanical one as has been demonstrated in a variety of example @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the diversity of patterns of motion of single active particles , either biological or synthetic , is wide , particularly in the biological realm , where there are as many of such patterns as species of organisms in nature .",
    "thus , no wonder why the other main line of research focuses on developing the theoretical frameworks to describe such , most of the times complex , patterns of motion exhibited by single active particles @xcite .",
    "one aspect of interest corresponds to those swimmers , either alive or passive , that show chiral motion , i.e. , a well defined state ( clockwise or anticlockwise ) of the circular motion component of the particle trajectories . as a matter of fact , a plethora of biological organisms @xcite and synthetic particles as well @xcite exhibit chiral motion exhibited as helical motion in three dimensions and circular in two .",
    "the processes that lead to chiral motion of active articles may be diverse @xcite , the simplest situation in two dimensions corresponds to a geometric effect , that is to say , to the misaligning of the direction of the propelling force and the orientation of the particle axis @xcite . a simple effective - force model , that leads to circular patterns of motion , is the inclusion of an effective constant `` torque '' in the _ langevin _ equations that drive the orientation of the self - propulsive force @xcite .",
    "such constant torque exerts the particle to rotate with constant angular velocity @xcite , leading to circular trajectories in two dimensions and to helical ones in three dimensions .",
    "such torque , for instance , may be externally caused by a magnetic field that act over the magnetic moment of magnetic bacteria or used over nanorods to steer them @xcite .",
    "this theoretical framework is now standard and has been used in a variety of studies as in the study of the diffusion properties of active particles moving in two dimensions @xcite , of motors having a component of circular motion @xcite , and of the effects of confinement in the diffusion properties of chiral - active particles where directed motion has been observed @xcite .",
    "another approach that has been used to study two - dimensional chiral motion is the _ rotationally persistent _ random walks , where the introduction of a clockwise or counter - clockwise angular bias at each new step the walker takes @xcite .",
    "a connection , if any , among all these analytical approaches is still missing in the literature and deserves a future analysis .",
    "analytical studies of diffusion of active particles in three dimensions has been received more less attention than its two - dimensional counterpart . in ref @xcite , for instance , the diffusion of torqued , active particles in three - dimensional space is analyzed through overdamped - langevin equations , which are solved for the time dependence of the first two moments of the particle positions , namely , the average position and the mean square displacement from which the effective diffusion coefficient is computed . in ref .",
    "@xcite the diffusion properties of swimmers that move in three dimensions with fixed , mean curvature and torsion , are studied by the use of stochastic frenet - serret equations which generalizes the deterministic description of helical motion given in @xcite .",
    "a more general instance is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where a self - propelled brownian spinning top is considered through the analysis of overdamped - langevin equations .",
    "a complete description in three dimensions in terms of the smoluchowski - like equations is challenging and deserves a thorough analysis even in the absence of chirality .",
    "this approach leads us directly to the time evolution of the probability distribution of the particle positions , and from it , to relevant information regarding the characteristic features of the pattern of motion as its non - gaussian nature @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the diffusion of active brownian particles that move freely with constant speed in infinite three - dimensional space subject to an effective torque .",
    "we derive smoluchowski - like equations that take into account the persistence effects of active brownian motion and of chirality as well .",
    "the equations are derived from the fokker - planck equation for the total probability density of finding a particle at position @xmath0 moving in the direction @xmath1 at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 by coarse - graining over the direction of motion . from @xmath4 analytical expression for the mean square displacement and the kurtosis",
    "are given .",
    "a comparison of our prescription formulas with numerical simulations was carried out by solving the corresponding langevin - like equations of active particles subject to torques .",
    "our analysis reveals oscillations on time - dependence of the kurtosis in the ballistic regime and for large values of the torque strength .",
    "these oscillations points the helical pattern of motion .",
    "we also compute the stationary value of the kurtosis for an ensemble of active articles , each particle moving under the effects of an instance of an effective torque uniformly distributed on the sphere .",
    "interestingly this situation exhibit the `` anomalous , yet brownian , diffusion '' effect , also known as _ weakly anomalous diffusion _",
    ", where the probability distribution is not gaussian but the diffusion is normal with a mean squared displacement that grows linearly with time .",
    "this paper continues as follows : in section [ sectii ] we present the langevin equations for the trajectories of particles that move with constant velocity and their corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability density @xmath5 of a particle being at point @xmath0 , moving in the direction @xmath6 at time @xmath2 is stated in [ sectiii ] . in sect the method of analysis is presented [ sectiv ] .",
    "results are discussed in [ sectv ] .",
    "we finally give our conclusion and final remarks in section [ sectvi ] .",
    "we consider a self - propelled microscopic particle , for which the influence of thermal fluctuations due to the surrounding fluid can not be neglected . the interaction with the fluid accounts for both , the brownian component of the particle motion and the disspative mechanism due to the fluid viscosity .",
    "the active component of the particle s motion is accounted as the result of an _ active _ or _ swimming force _",
    "@xcite , which is defined to be proportional to the particle s swimming velocity , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hydrodynamic resistance that couples translational velocity to force given by @xmath9 for a sphere , with @xmath10 the fluid viscosity and @xmath11 the particle radius .",
    "thus the time evolution of the particle kinematic velocity , @xmath12 is given by the langevin equation @xmath13 for low reynolds numbers the approximated , overdamped dynamics is valid and last equation is replaced with @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the change in time of the particle position is due to the particles internal drive ( self - propulsion ) and to the influence of stochastic passive fluctuations , @xmath16 , that randomize the translational motion of the particle .",
    "last equation is supplemented by additional stochastic differential equations for the swimming velocity @xmath17 , from which the explicit time dependence of the swimming speed @xmath18 and the swimming direction @xmath19 , are determined @xcite . in the overdamped - speed limit ,",
    "i.e. when the dynamics that drives the time evolution of @xmath18 ( around a characteristic , fixed value @xmath20 ) , is faster than others in the system , the particle speed can directly be set to @xmath20 .",
    "this leaves to consideration of only one stochastic differential equation that provides the evolution in time of the direction of the swimming velocity , from now on simply denoted with @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that such evolution in time is only due to _ active _ fluctuations @xmath22 , which in many cases surpass thermal ones .",
    "chirality is taken into account by assuming that rotational , active fluctuations does not average zero but a constant , finite value @xmath23 , which gives a fixed direction @xmath24 in three dimensional space around the particles rotate with constant angular acceleration @xmath25 .    under these considerations ,",
    "the time evolution of the particles kinematic state is therefore given by the following stochastic differential equations    [ modelo ] @xmath26    @xmath16 and @xmath22 are modeled as three - dimensional vectors with gaussian white noise components , i.e. their entries satisfy @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for the translational ones , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "greek sub - indices denote vector components ; @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath10 correspond to the temperature and viscosity of the fluid respectively , @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath11 the radius of the particle that has been assumed spherical .",
    "@xmath34 denotes the active - rotational diffusion constant ( temperature independent ) that characterizes active noise , and as usual , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the dirac delta and kronecker delta respectively .",
    "the proper integration of equation requires the consideration of the explicit multiplicative process involved and that @xmath37 at each time , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the components of the unitary vector @xmath21 . both aspects are taken into account if the process described by eq .",
    "is acknowledged to be equivalent to the brownian motion of the tip of the unit vector @xmath21 on the unit sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ unitsphere ] ) . in the interpretation of it @xcite , eq . can be transformed , with the use of spherical coordinates , into the following pair of stochastic differential equations for the azimuthal , @xmath40 , and polar , @xmath41 , angles    , computed from eq . .",

    "the stochastic processes @xmath49 and @xmath50 are gaussian white noises with zero mean and autocorrelation function @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "one advantage of this formalism is that simple integration schemes , as the euler one , are numerically stable when applied to equations than when applied directly to .",
    "we reserve the use of variable with an explicit time dependence to denote those stochastic processes that appear in the langevin eqs . and , reserving the use of the same symbols , but without the explicit temporal dependence , to the corresponding variables that appear in the fokker - planck equation .",
    "thus our analysis considers the isotropic diffusion process on the sphere , with rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath34 , which allows us to choose it as a time scale @xmath53 and the length scale @xmath54 .",
    "this choice leads to two free dimensionless parameters , namely : the pclet number @xmath55 , which measures the effects of active motion in relation to diffusion , i.e. , the larger the pclet number the larger are the persistence effect due to activity ( see fig . [ trajectories ] ) ; and the strength of the chirality @xmath56 . regarding the chirality we consider two cases : i ) when this is constant and the same for each particle and ii ) when the chirality depends on each particle , i.e. different trajectories realizations correspond to different realizations of noise and chiral direction , in this last case the chirality direction for each particle is chosen from a uniform probability distribution .     and chiral intensity @xmath57 , for different values of the pclet number : @xmath58 ( blue ) , @xmath59 ( red ) , 10 ( magenta ) , and 1 ( cyan ) .",
    "axes correspond to the cartesian coordinates @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 in units of @xmath63 . ]",
    "numerical calculations have been carried out by integration of eqs . using a simple euler scheme with a time step @xmath64 , in figure [ trajectories ] some trajectories",
    "are shown for different values of @xmath65 ( blue ) , @xmath58 ( red ) , @xmath66 ( magenta ) and @xmath67 ( cyan ) with a torque pointing along the @xmath68 direction with magnitude @xmath69 .",
    "numerical results presented in the following sections were obtained by averaging over @xmath70 trajectories .",
    "in this section we present a fokker - planck equation that accounts for the evolution in time of the one - particle probability density , @xmath71 , of finding an active , chiral particle diffusing freely in three - dimensional space , at position @xmath0 and moving in the direction @xmath1 at time @xmath2 .",
    "such an equation can be derived in a simple manner by use of novikov s theorem @xcite ( see appendix [ appa ] ) .",
    "we follow this procedure and not the alternate one of deriving the fokker - planck equation from it s interpretation of eq . , since the later would give rise to extra terms not present in the former derivation , terms that usually makes the analysis more difficult .",
    "later on in this paper , the results obtained from the analysis of the fokker - planck obtained are compared with the numerical solutions of the langevin equation in the it interpretation .    in addition",
    ", eq . describes the standard diffusion of a point - particle on the surface of the unitary sphere as mentioned before , its corresponding smoluchowski equation is an instance of the general theory of _ brownian motion on a manifold _ developed by van kampen in ref .",
    "there , the author analyses the consequences of _ geometrical _ constraints as long as of _ symmetry induced _ constraints , on the diffusion of a point particle .",

    "namely @xmath80\\\\ + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\left[\\sin\\theta     \\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\right)\\cdot\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\ , \\hat{p}({\\boldsymbol{k}},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}},t)\\right]\\\\ + \\mathcal{l}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}})\\hat{p}({\\boldsymbol{k}},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}},t ) \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] being @xmath81 the unitary fourier transform of @xmath71 with respect the spatial variable @xmath0 .",
    "without loss of generality we choose a system of cartesian coordinates such that @xmath82 , thus equation reduces to @xmath83    we now expand @xmath84 on the set of eigenfunctions of equation when @xmath20 is set to zero , specifically , on the set of functions @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 denotes the spherical harmonic functions that are standardly defined as @xmath90 , @xmath91 being the associated laguerre polynomial , notice that the explicit dependence on @xmath92 and @xmath6 is made clear through expression , thus we have @xmath93 where we recognize in the first factor the fourier transform of the gaussian probability density @xmath94 due to translational brownian motion solution of the three - dimensional diffusion equation , while the second factor encompasses the dynamics that corresponds to the effects due to self - propulsion .",
    "further , expansion explicitly shows up the time - scale associated with the damping factor of each multipole distribution ( spherical harmonic ) , that contributes to , the higher the multipole order the faster it decays with time .",
    "in fact , in the asymptotic limit , when high multipole distributions have damped , only the rotationally symmetric distribution is expected to remain .",

    "in the spatial coordinates , i.e. , in consideration of the inverse fourier transform of , the convolution of @xmath100 with the coefficient @xmath101 , @xmath102 corresponds to the space - dependent multipole of the decomposition , into spherical harmonics , of the distribution of the direction of self - propulsion on the unit sphere . in this way",
    ", one should expect the monopole @xmath103 to be the dominant term in the long time limit , for which the distribution @xmath1 is uniform on the unit sphere and leads to the well - known diffusive behavior , at a shorter time regime the dipole distribution denoted as an order one rank tensor , @xmath104 $ ] , that characterizes the polar order of the distribution of @xmath1 , must be taken into account . in this regime",
    "the effects of persistence are apparent and , at an even shorter time regime , the quadrupole distribution that corresponds to a traceless , symmetric second order rank tensor , which can be written in terms only of @xmath105 ( see appendix ) , is related to the nematic order of the distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "further , one can notice that the expansion is akin to the expansion in powers of the unit vector @xmath1 @xcite , namely @xmath106 commonly , such expansion is approximately closed at the first two terms ( also known as @xmath107 approximation @xcite ) that involved the probability density of @xmath108 that equals @xmath109 and the current field @xmath110 whose components in terms of the dipole distribution are given explicitly in the appendix .",
    "this approximation takes into account the persistence effects of motion in various contexts and generally leads to telegrapher - like equations whose validity is restricted to the long - time regime .",
    "description of phenomena at shorter time regimes requires the consideration of higher order terms than the dipole one , which results in a difficult task .",
    "analogously , @xmath111 can be written explicitly in terms of the five independent quadrupole coefficients as given in the appendix . to close this paragraph ,",
    "we want to comment in passing that the transport equation corresponds to the _ one - speed diffusion equation _ ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , used to describe , in the absence of chirality , the mono - energetic transport process of neutrons and photons in the simplified case for which the scattering of the direction of motion is considered independent of the particles kinetic energy .",

    "substitution of expansion into eq .",
    ", results in a equation that after being multiplied by @xmath114 and integrated over the solid angle @xmath98 , the following hierarchy of equations for the coefficients @xmath115 are obtained @xmath116{y}_{n}^{m*}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{v}}),\\ ] ] where the orthogonality property of the spherical harmonics has been used .",
    "the integral in gives the explicit coupling factors among the coefficients @xmath115 owing to the advection term related to self - propulsion , @xmath117 in , and is reminiscent of the integrals that commonly appear in quantum mechanics regarding the calculation , to first order in perturbation theory , of the transition dipole moments for an electron of a hydrogenoid atom in an external electromagnetic field . in our case we define @xmath118 where the matrix elements    [ matrixelementsi ] @xmath119    are explicitly given in the appendix .",
    "there , one observes that the coupling factors vanish except when both , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are met .",
    "thus we have that for @xmath122 , the coefficient with given pair of indices @xmath123 is coupled with only the six nearestcoefficient neighbors with indices @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and we have explicitly that @xmath127^{1/2}e^{-i\\tau_{0}t}(k_{y}+ik_{x})\\right.\\\\ + \\hat{p}_{n+1}^{m-1}\\left[\\frac{(n - m+2)(n - m+1)}{(2n+1)(2n+3)}\\right]^{1/2}e^{i\\tau_{0}t}(k_{y}-ik_{x})\\\\ -\\left.\\hat{p}_{n+1}^{m}\\left[\\frac{(n+m+1)(n - m+1)}{(2n+1)(2n+3)}\\right]^{1/2}2ik_{z}\\right\\}\\\\ -\\frac{v_{0}}{2}e^{2d_{\\omega}nt}\\left\\{\\hat{p}_{n-1}^{m+1}\\left[\\frac{(n - m)(n - m-1)}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}\\right]^{1/2}e^{-i\\tau_{0}t}(k_{y}+ik_{x})\\right.\\\\ + \\hat{p}_{n-1}^{m-1}\\left[\\frac{(n+m)(n+m-1)}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}\\right]^{1/2}e^{i\\tau_{0}t}(k_{y}-ik_{x})\\\\ + \\left.\\hat{p}_{n-1}^{m}\\left[\\frac{(n - m)(n+m)}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}\\right]^{1/2}2ik_{z}\\right\\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath128 the coefficient with indices @xmath128 , @xmath129 is coupled only with the three coefficients with pair of indices @xmath130 and @xmath131 , since @xmath132 whenever @xmath133 and/or @xmath134 .",
