    "quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are ubiquitous phenomena wherever we look in the universe .",
    "the subset of quasars known as broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) are characterized by blue - shifted , rest - frame uv absorption troughs due to gas outflow . even before the first definitive survey in @xcite",
    ", balqsos provided a unique glimpse into the central engines of agn , where the nature of the intrinsic absorption has important implications for the structure of the central engine . to classify a quasar as a balqso",
    ", the traditional definition of @xcite requires the absorption troughs to be at least 2,000 km s@xmath7 wide .",
    "recent studies have relaxed this , e.g. , @xcite , to include quasars with absorption troughs over 1,000 km s@xmath7 in width .",
    "regardless of which definition is used , balqsos are further divided into those that exhibit absorption troughs from only high - ionization species ( hibals ) and those with low - ionization species ( lobals ) .",
    "most balqsos are hibals , and most lobals also have high - ionization troughs in their spectra @xcite .",
    "lobals are further classified by the low - ionization species they exhibit : in this paper , the objects surveyed have strong iron absorption , and are therefore iron lobals ( felobals ) .",
    "this type of balqso is rare , and comprises only 1.52.1% of the entire quasar population @xcite , while lobals and balqsos make up @xmath847% @xcite and @xmath82040% @xcite , respectively , depending on the threshold of the trough width .",
    "focusing on felobals is meaningful because of their unique characteristics and the bearing they have on the broader picture : either as an evolutionary link in the normal agn lifetime , or as a geometric interpretation of a uniform class of objects .",
    "besides the low - ionization absorption lines , the optical continua for lobals are more reddened than hibals and normal qsos , suggestive of stronger dust absorption , perhaps from large quantities of dust in the vicinity of the central engine @xcite .",
    "lobals in particular are more apparently x - ray weak than normal balqsos @xcite .",
    "there is a large portion , @xmath880% , not detected in x - rays , along with lower than expected values for the uv to x - ray luminosity ratio , @xmath2 ( @xmath2  lower than expected by @xmath9 ) , that leads most previous studies , e.g. @xcite , to conclude that there is extreme x - ray absorption in lobals .",
    "@xcite , however , found that lobals in general have lower column densities ( @xmath10 ) than hibals .",
    "this conclusion may have been influenced by their x - ray bright sample , required for sufficient quality to perform x - ray spectral analyses .",
    "low - ionization balqsos with broad iron absorption lines ( felobals ) represent an extreme category .",
    "they have the reddest continuum spectra , complex uv spectra , and possibly largest x - ray absorption column densities .",
    "there are a handful of felobals already studied in x - rays , with only a few detections .",
    "almost all were observed using the sensitive x - ray telescope , _",
    "chandra_. the nearby felobal mrk 231 ( @xmath11 ) was also detected by _ xmm - newton _ and _ bepposax _ @xcite in addition to _ chandra _",
    "@xcite , which allowed for the most in - depth studies of an felobal to date .",
    "all three studies find the 0.410 kev x - ray emission to be mostly reflected and scattered into our line of sight , and the direct x - ray emission is mostly absorbed . using the pds detector on board",
    "_ bepposax _ , @xcite detect the direct x - ray emission of mrk  231 at @xmath0 in the 1560 kev band , which allows the authors to constrain an intrinsic column density @xmath12 .",
    "another recent study focused on two felobals is @xcite , where the authors calculated @xmath2  upper limits for both objects , comparing them with a large sample of normal agn @xcite .",
    "other studies focused on subsets of quasars , but had felobals contained within their scope .",
    "quite a few of these focused on radio - detected objects . in one study , @xcite selected 12 luminous red quasars , with the criteria that they were also detected by first @xcite , and used standard aperture photometry ( for details see   [ sdr ] ) to conduct x - ray analyses .",
    "they found that all of their objects are x - ray absorbed to some degree ; in addition , they found a slightly steeper spectral slope than that for normal quasars , with an unweighted mean of @xmath13 and a high - energy region weighted mean of @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite selected five radio - loud balqsos , three of which are lobals , and two of those lobals exhibited iron features .",
    "the three lobals were found to exhibit the steepest @xmath2  values in the study .",
    "@xcite also selected 21 radio - loud balqsos , one of which is classified as an felobal .",
    "the authors proposed that the x - ray properties are explained by a model that consists of x - ray emission in the disk / corona and linked to the radio - jet .",
    "almost all of these studies calculated intrinsic column density for these objects , most of which are in the 10@xmath15 ",
    "10@xmath16  range .",
    "these will be discussed in detail in   [ tci ] . in this study",
    ", we will use our x - ray detections and non - detections to constrain x - ray absorption column densities .",
    "one of our objects is the first x - ray detection ( at the 3@xmath17 level ) by _ suzaku _  of an felobal .",
    "it is not understood why felobals possess unique physical characteristics ; evolution and geometry are the contending theories . a geometric interpretation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposes that the broad absorption line region of a balqso simply arises from looking straight down a narrow outflow , while normal agn and quasars are the same object viewed from different angles .",
    "a recent discovery of a lobal transitioning from an felobal within a few years rest frame favors special lines of sight , because of the short time scale @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite proposed that balqsos , and felobals especially , are early progenitors of normal agn and quasars , at the very end of an extreme starburst period and in the process of blowing out material from type ii sne that is fe ii rich .",
    "this evolutionary theory is partially supported by the higher fraction of lobals at high ir luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a recent _ spitzer _ spectral survey of six felobals @xcite showed significant signatures of dust and pah emissions .",
    "spectral modelings in the uv regime also support a large covering fraction of the wind for felobals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other evidence , such as the decreasing fraction as a function of radio luminosity , is consistent with a geometric interpretation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the population of lobals and felobals could also be a combination of both evolution and geometry @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is how felobals contribute to the quasar feedback process .",
    "agn feedback is widely used in galaxy formation models ( e.g. , granato et al .",
    "2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; hopkins et al .  2005 ; shankar et al .",
    "2008b ) to explain the co - evolution of agn and their host galaxies .",
    "feedback can reproduce such phenomena as the @xmath18@xmath17 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , star formation rates @xcite , and even the shortfall in the halo baryon fraction @xcite . whether felobals are an evolutionary stage or a geometric interpretation of agn , studying their feedback efficiency allows us to add to our limited picture of their physical characteristics .    in this paper we present new",

    "only a small sample of felobals has been studied in x - rays previously .",
    "we summarize all the measurements in table  [ density ] , which is divided into two subsamples : those that are radio loud , and those that are not .",
    "the radio loud objects tend to have lower column densities , which could be due to geometry or evolution .",
    "the x - ray emission may be linked to the jets as well as from the corona right above the central portion of the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bal wind ( see @xcite for a detailed illustration ) , would then only absorb x - ray emission from the accretion disk region .",
    "we do not know for certain what complicated structure dependence for x - ray emission may exist in a radio loud felobal , but the column density results are still important and thus we include them for completeness .",
    "our three felobals are radio quiet , and our constraints are consistent with the subsample that is not known to be radio loud .",
    "these objects in general are found to have  on the order of a few @xmath73  or higher .",
    "notably , the most recent study by @xcite found column densities for j2215 - 0045 and j0300 + 0048 to be @xmath159 , with j2215 - 0045 just above the range we calculate for j1723 + 5553 , but still consistent with our  for the two non - detections .",

    "cite lower column densities ( @xmath161 ) , but they also noted that this is an average expected column density for a hibal , and that  for a lobal would be higher .",
    "the fact that our 3@xmath17 detection in j1723 + 5553 is in the observed 210 kev ( rest frame 630 kev ) hard band rather than the soft x - ray band is significant , as this is expected from highly absorbed x - ray emission from the corona above the smbh .",
    "the non - detection of the source in the observed 0.22 kev ( rest frame 0.66 kev ) band is consistent with our interpretation that we detect the direct x - ray emission in the observed 210 kev band , as high column densities will suppress the soft x - rays more than the hard x - rays .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that none of these objects is detected , even at the 3@xmath17 level of significance , for the broadband observed 0.210 kev ( rest frame 0.630 kev ) energy range .",
    "if the observed 210 kev spectrum is reflected or scattered into our line of sight , the x - ray spectrum will be a flat power - law , and we would also detect the source in the observed 0.22 kev band , which has a larger collecting area for _ suzaku_. combining the measurements from this paper and those from @xcite , it is most likely that the intrinsic  column density absorbing the x - ray emission in a radio - quiet felobal is in the range from @xmath162 up to @xmath86 .",
    "this is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than the x - ray absorption range in balqsos ( @xmath163 , e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "2006 ) .    using @xmath2  to provide limits on intrinsic column density also allows us to provide limits on the intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "using the combined constraints summarized at the end of section  [ mla ] , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity for j0943 + 5417 is @xmath164 ; for j1352 + 4239 it is @xmath165 ; for j1723 + 5553 it is @xmath166 .",
    "compared to the normal sample of agn from @xcite , these luminosities fall into the middle to high range of x - ray luminosities for normal quasars .",

    "such a large optical depth will also significantly modulate the uv flux ( @xmath8400 times dimmer ) ; however , these objects are already more luminous in the uv than most of the agn in the @xcite study . as another check ,",
    "we calculate the black hole mass of the quasars assuming they are emitting at 1/3 of the eddington luminosity ( e.g. , shankar et al .",
    "we extrapolate our rest frame luminosities to 5100  and assume a bolometric correction of 10.33 for 5100  @xcite before using equation  [ mbh ] to find the black hole masses .",

    "the optical depth would be @xmath194 , which would dim the intrinsic luminosity by one and a half times . at the column density corresponding to the expected @xmath2  for j0943 + 5417 and j1352 + 4239 , @xmath195  ( from the @xmath2@xmath187 relation , and still within the limits for j1723 + 5553 )",
    ", the optical depth of @xmath190 would mean the intrinsic luminosity would be increased by 400 times , giving a black hole mass of @xmath196 .",
    "such a large mass is not a physical possibility ; therefore , it is unlikely that these objects are super - luminous in the uv , and we only see the tiny fraction of thomson scattered emission .",
    "since the x - ray emission region is expected to be smaller than the uv emission region from either variability ( e.g. , chartas et al .",
    "2001 ) or quasar microlensing ( e.g. , dai et al .",
    "2003 , 2010a ; pooley et al .  2007 ;",
    "morgan et al .",
    "2008 ; chartas et al .",
    "2009 ) arguments , it is instead possible that the x - ray absorbing material is located between the x - ray and uv emission region and only covers the x - ray emitting region .",
    "this is consistent with the disk wind models of @xcite and murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , where an essential component of the model is the compton thick shielding gas between the x - ray and uv emission , protecting the disk wind from being ionized by the x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite also reached a similar conclusion , where the thomson scattering optical depth was argued to have @xmath197 ( @xmath198 times dimmer ) . in this paper ,",
    "the constraint is likely more stringent with @xmath190 ( @xmath199 times dimmer ) .",
    "aoki ( 2010 ) analyzed the uv spectrum of j1723 + 5553 , and found the  column density in the uv wind was @xmath200 using the curve of growth method with the unresolved balmer absorption lines .",
    "aoki ( 2010 ) pointed out that the covering fraction can not be determined due to unresolved absorption lines , and assumed a covering fraction of 1 .",
    "the column density would be higher than the given limit if the covering fraction is significantly less than 1 .",
    "the limit derived by aoki ( 2010 ) is seven orders of magnitude less than , but still consistent with , our x - ray column densities . if the x - ray and uv absorbing gasses are located in different regions , it can still be incorporated into both existing geometrical interpretations of felobals ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 ; gallagher & everett 2007 ) or evolutionary models ( e.g. , fabian 1999 ) .",
    "however , for evolutionary models the uv emission should come from the photosphere of the gas / dust cloud rather than the accretion disk .",
    "such models have been simulated in recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and support that felobals may be an evolutionary stage in the development of normal quasars .",
    "another explanation is that felobals have intrinsic seds different from normal quasars .",
    "they could be extremely x - ray weak compared to normal quasars , as in the case of the narrow - line quasar phl 1811 @xcite , or the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy wpvs 007 @xcite .",
    "this would nullify our   constraints for j0934 + 5417 and j1352 + 4239 , since they are obtained by assuming a normal quasar sed .",
    "however , this would not explain j1723 + 5553 , which we detect in the observed 210  kev band , but not in the observed 0.2 - 2  kev band . if j1723 + 5553 were intrinsically x - ray weak , and x - ray unabsorbed , we would expect to see a flat - line power - law slope for quasars in the hard and the soft x - ray bands .",
    "this is not consistent with our observations .",
    "in addition , the   constraint from the x - ray hardness ratio is still valid for @xmath193  with the thomson scattering optical depth @xmath201 , which could only marginally scatter the uv emission if the true  column density is close to the lower boundary .",
    "more x - ray detections of felobals are needed so that we are not restricted by using the broadband sed constraints .",
    "it is also possible that quasar host galaxies contribute a fraction of rest frame 40007000  emission ; however , the contamination at this band is usually small .",
    "in addition , we correct the intrinsic dust extinction for felobals using the average dust extinction for lobals , which will underestimate the intrinsic flux and give less steep @xmath2  values . a priori ,",
    "it is unclear what the net effect of these two possibilities will be on the broadband flux ; ir spectroscopy is needed to help resolve these issues .",
    "we calculate the kinetic feedback efficiency , @xmath202 , of the x - ray absorber in felobals using the location , luminosity , and  column density constraints obtained in this paper .",
    "in particular , @xmath203 is the kinetic feedback power , @xmath204 ( e.g. , moe et al .  2009 ) , where @xmath205 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath206 is the proton mass , @xmath207 , @xmath208 ,  and @xmath209 are the covering fraction , location , column density , and velocity of the wind , respectively , and @xmath210 is the bolometric luminosity of the quasar . if the seds of felobals are consistent with those of normal quasars , we obtain a reasonable @xmath211 ; this is the upper end of the column density range for our 3@xmath17 detection , and entirely consistent with our column density lower limits for the non - detections .",
    "we locate the wind between the uv and x - ray emission regions , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , using the microlensing constraints of dai et al .",
    "( 2010a ) . for the covering fraction",
    ", we use the intrinsic felobal population range of 1.5% and 2.1% , depending on which model @xcite is used , and assume the quasars are emitting at a typical 0.3 eddington limit ( shankar et al .",
    "we are left with one uncertainty , the velocity of the x - ray absorber .",
    "the velocity of the bal wind is usually measured in the uv wind , which can reach up to @xmath214 .",
    "since the x - ray absorbing wind is located at smaller radii than the uv absorber , its velocity can be higher than the wind velocity measured from the uv spectrum .",
    "the only velocity measurement of the x - ray absorber is from the blue - shifted x - ray absorption lines detected in a few gravitationally lensed balqsos ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , 2007 ) , and this velocity can reach 0.30.8@xmath215 . since the x - ray absorption lines are mostly detected in mini - bals , we could possibly be looking through the edge of the wind , where the wind can be by fully accelerated .",
    "thus , we consider the x - ray absorption line as providing an upper limit , and assume our wind velocity is 0.10.3@xmath215 , between the estimates from the two methods .",
    "we find the feedback efficiency , @xmath216 , for felobals is in the range ( outflow velocity dependent ) of either 0.2%4.8% for a covering fraction of 1.5% , or 0.3%6.9% for a covering fraction of 2.1% . to reach the minimum of 5% required to explain the co - evolution between black holes and host galaxies ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; granato et al .",
    "2004 ; hopkins et al .  2005 ) , with the other variables given here , we need a column density of @xmath217  or @xmath218  for low velocity wind with the different covering fractions .",
    "these are consistent with our lower limits on column density for the two non - detections , but out of reach for j1723 + 5553 . however , for the high end of the conservative wind velocity range , only @xmath219 and @xmath220 are needed for @xmath2211.5% and 2.1% , respectively .",
    "both of these column densities are consistent with the results for j1723 + 5553 , and thus it is likely that felobals can contribute to agn feedback .",
    "this becomes even more likely when models like @xcite are considered .",
    "they describe a two - stage  feedback process , where a weak wind from the central engine energizes a hot , diffuse interstellar medium , which is then amplified when it it hits instabilities in a cold cloud within the host .",
    "this amplification outside of the central engine requires feedback efficiency as small as 0.5% .",
    "the bal wind in felobals , therefore , is a promising candidate for the feedback process responsible for the co - evolution between black holes and host galaxies .",
    "more measurements of @xmath28 are needed to further quantify how important the contributions are from felobals and balqsos to kinetic feedback efficiency .",
