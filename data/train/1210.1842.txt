    "quantum zero - point fluctuations manifest themselves in a variety of macroscopic effects .",
    "a prominent example is casimir s demonstration that these fluctuations lead to attraction of two perfectly conducting parallel plates @xcite .",
    "experimental advances in precision measurements of the casimir force @xcite have revived interest in finding frameworks where one can compute these forces both numerically @xcite and analytically . a particularly successful approach in applications to different geometries and material properties",
    "is based on scattering methods and techniques @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the quantum - field - theoretic problem is reduced to that of finding the _ classical _ scattering matrix of each object .",
    "another manifestation of fluctuations appears in the so - called dynamical casimir effect : when objects are set in motion , they interact with the fluctuations of the background vacuum in a time - dependent fashion which excites photons and emits radiation .",
    "in fact , accelerating boundaries radiate energy and thus experience friction . an early example of this phenomenon was discussed by moore for a one dimensional cavity @xcite . a relativistic analysis of an accelerating mirror in 1 + 1 dimension in ref .",
    "@xcite employs techniques from conformal field theory . a perturbative study of the latter confirmed and generalized its results to higher dimensions @xcite . among other methods ,",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem has been used to compute the frictional force on a moving sphere in free space @xcite , a hamiltonian formalism has been applied to the problem of photon production in cavities @xcite , and a ( euclidean ) path - integral formulation is introduced to study the `` vacuum '' friction for a rough plate moving laterally @xcite .",
    "we specially note that an input - output formalism relating the incoming and outgoing operators is used to compute , among other things , the frequency and angular spectrum of radiated photons @xcite .",
    "while a substantial literature is devoted to objects with perfect boundary conditions , dielectric and dispersive materials have also been studied in some cases @xcite .",
    "in fact , dispersive objects exhibit similar effects even when they move at a constant velocity .",
    "for example , two parallel plates moving laterally with respect to each other experience a ( non - contact ) frictional force @xcite .",

    "( translational motion of a single object is trivial due to the lorentz symmetry . )",
    "the latter examples , consisting of dispersive objects moving at a constant rate , are usually treated within the framework of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem or the closely related rytov formalism @xcite .",
    "inspection of the literature on the dynamical casimir effect leads to the following observations : there are a plethora of interesting  sometimes counter - intuitive phenomena emerging from the motion of a body in an ambient quantum field @xcite .",
    "these phenomena span a number of subfields in physics , and have been treated by a variety of different formalisms .",
    "even the simplest examples appear to require rather complex computations . only recently experimental realizations  using a squid to mimic the moving boundary of a cavity ( transmission line ) @xcite  have made precise measurements possible , raising the hope for an explosion of activity similar to the post - precision experiment era of static casimir forces .",
    "this motivates reexamination of theoretical literature on the subject , aiming for a simple and unifying framework for analysis .    in this work ,",
    "we follow two goals .",
    "first , inspired by the success of the scattering - theory methods in ( static ) casimir forces , we attempt at extending these techniques to dynamical casimir problems . we find that the _ classical _ scattering matrix is naturally incorporated into the formalism .",
    "however , dynamical configurations provide new channels where the incoming frequency jumps to different values , hence the scattering matrix should be defined accordingly .",
    "second , we aim for a universal framework which brings the diverse set of problems in dynamical casimir under the same rubric .",
    "most notably , we treat accelerating boundaries , modulated optical setups and moving dispersive objects  usually tackled with different techniques , as explained above  on the same footing .    in this paper",
    ", computations are performed for a scalar field theory .",
    "the generalization to electromagnetism is straightforward in principle , while practical computations are more complicated in the latter .",
    "we find scalar field theory convenient to set the framework for more realistic applications .",
