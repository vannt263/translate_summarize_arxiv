    "the production of heavy quarkonium in high energy collisions remains a challenging problem in qcd .",
    "this problem has some aspects that are inherently perturbative , because it requires the creation of a heavy quark - antiquark pair .",
    "it also has aspects that are inherently nonperturbative , because the heavy quark @xmath2 and the antiquark @xmath3 are required to form a bound state .",
    "the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization approach uses an effective field theory to systematically separate perturbative short - distance aspects from nonperturbative long - distance aspects  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive production cross section is expressed as the sum of products of parton scattering factors that can be calculated using perturbative qcd and nrqcd matrix elements that can be treated as phenomenological parameters .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formulas have not yet been proven rigorously , but they are well - motivated by proofs of factorization to all orders of perturbation theory for other processes in high energy physics . the nrqcd factorization formula for gluon fragmentation into quarkonium has survived a nontrivial test at next - to - next - to - leading order , although it required a modification of the formal definition of the nrqcd matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "nrqcd predicts a definite hierarchy in the size of the nrqcd matrix elements according to how they scale with the typical relative velocity @xmath4 of the heavy quark in quarkonium  @xcite .",
    "however , the nrqcd factorization framework is sufficiently flexible that any model for quarkonium production that is compatible with perturbative qcd at short distances should be expressible in terms of assumptions about the nrqcd matrix elements . the color - singlet model ( csm )",
    "can be expressed as the vanishing of all nrqcd matrix elements except one .",
    "the csm matrix element corresponds to formation of the quarkonium from @xmath5 in a color - singlet state with the same angular - momentum quantum numbers as the quarkonium in the potential model .",
    "the color - evaporation model can be expressed as the nrqcd matrix elements having a hierarchy according to the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath5 pair without regard to their color and spin quantum numbers  @xcite .    in 2005 ,",
    "lansberg , cudell , and kalinovsky ( lck ) proposed a new mechanism for heavy quarkonium production that they called the `` @xmath0channel '' cut  @xcite . in the case of the production of quarkonium from gluon - gluon collisions , they claimed it was leading order in the qcd coupling constant but had not been taken into account in any previous analyses",
    ". the name `` @xmath0channel cut '' refers to a mathematical description of the mechanism .",
    "it can be identified as a contribution to the imaginary part of the amplitude for quarkonium production in gluon - gluon collisions that corresponds to a cutkosky cut through @xmath2 and @xmath3 lines only .",
    "it is thus associated with a discontinuity of the amplitude in the square @xmath0 of the center - of - mass energy of the colliding gluons .",
    "this mechanism corresponds physically to the creation of the heavy quark and antiquark through the parton scattering process @xmath6 followed by the formation of quarkonium through the rescattering of the @xmath5 pair .",
    "a physical description of this mechanism is @xmath5 rescattering into quarkonium plus a recoiling gluon .",
    "lck applied their @xmath0channel cut mechanism to @xmath1 production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "they expressed the @xmath0channel cut contribution to the production amplitude as the sum of diagrams with a vertex @xmath7 for @xmath8 and diagrams with another vertex @xmath9 for @xmath10 that was introduced in order to restore a ward identity .",
    "they developed simple phenomenological models for these vertices and used them to estimate the @xmath0channel cut contribution to the inclusive @xmath1 cross section in @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath5 rescattering ( or @xmath0channel cut ) mechanism involves the formation of quarkonium from a @xmath5 pair that is created by a perturbative parton process , it must be expressible in terms of the conventional nrqcd factorization formula . in this paper",
    ", we identify the charm - pair rescattering contribution to the process @xmath13 as a next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) contribution to the color - singlet model term in the nrqcd factorization formula .",

    "their starting point was the amplitude @xmath18 for a color - singlet @xmath19 pair with total 4-momentum @xmath20 and relative 4-momentum @xmath21 to form @xmath1 with 4-momentum @xmath20 and polarization vector @xmath22 .",
    "this vertex is illustrated in fig .",
    "it can be defined diagrammatically by starting with the sum of all diagrams with two incoming @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines and two outgoing @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines .",

    "any amplitude for the production of @xmath1 can be expressed as a sum of diagrams with a vertex @xmath7 and additional qcd vertices .",
    "for example , the amplitude for @xmath24 at order @xmath17 has contributions from 6 one - loop box diagrams , one of which is shown in fig .",
    "the other five diagrams are obtained by permuting the attachments of the three gluons . for general quarkonium states ,",
    "there are also one - loop triangle diagrams involving a 3-gluon vertex . by setting the incoming and outgoing gluons on their mass shells , we obtain the t - matrix element for this process .",

    "a feynman diagram has a discontinuity in the invariant mass of any set of lines that are kinematically allowed to be on shell .",
    "this discontinuity can be represented by a cut diagram in which the cut passes through that set of lines .",
    "there are two possible cuts through the parton lines in the diagram in fig .",

    "the production amplitude for @xmath1 is a product of a wavefunction factor and the amplitude for producing a @xmath15 and @xmath16 that are on their mass shell in a color - singlet @xmath32 state with relative momentum 0 and total momentum equal to that of the @xmath1 . in an amplitude for @xmath1 production with vertex @xmath7",
    ", the meson @xmath19 cut puts the @xmath15 and @xmath16 on shell and therefore gives a contribution that resembles the amplitude in the color - singlet model . in the amplitude for @xmath24 at order @xmath17 with vertex @xmath7",

    "we now describe the formalism that lck used to calculate the @xmath0channel cut contribution to @xmath1 production .",
    "they assumed that the amplitude @xmath7 was dominated by the contribution from the @xmath19 fock state and has the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a scalar function of the relative 3-momentum @xmath35 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the @xmath1 rest frame .",

    "they parameterized @xmath7 as a gaussian with normalization factor @xmath36 and a momentum scale @xmath37 .",
    "this reduces @xmath7 to two phenomenological parameters .",

    "@xcite . ]",
    "lck recognized that the vertex @xmath7 is not gauge - invariant when the incoming @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not on their mass shells .",
    "one consequence is that the @xmath0channel cut to the amplitude for @xmath24 at order @xmath17 with vertex @xmath7 does not satisfy the ward identity associated with the current that creates the outgoing gluon .",
    "they proposed that the ward identity could be restored by adding diagrams with a 4-point vertex @xmath39 for @xmath10 .",
    "they did not give any diagrammatic definition of this vertex , but it was assumed to be of order @xmath40 relative to @xmath7 .",
    "there are two diagrams for @xmath24 at order @xmath38 with a vertex @xmath9 , both of which have an @xmath0channel cut .",
    "one of the diagrams is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and the other is obtained by reversing the arrows on the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines .",
    "the complete model of lck for the @xmath0channel cut contribution to the t - matrix element for @xmath24 at order @xmath17 is the sum of the 4 cut diagrams with vertex @xmath7 and the 2 cut diagrams with vertex @xmath9 .",
    "they took the charm quark mass to be @xmath41  gev , which is greater than @xmath42 so there is no meson @xmath19 cut . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lck proposed an expression for the vertex @xmath9 with no additional parameters that respects the ward identity .",
    "thus this model for the @xmath0channel cut contribution has 2 parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in addition to @xmath43 and the qcd coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "lck showed that in this model the cross section for @xmath1 production at the tevatron at large transverse momentum ( @xmath45 ) could be as large as the leading - order color - singlet model contribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lh proposed a more general expression for @xmath9 that depends on a phenomenological function .",
    "they introduced a simple parameterization for this function that depends on two parameters .",
    "thus this model for the @xmath0channel cut contribution has 4 parameters in addition to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "lh showed that if these parameters are adjusted so that the @xmath0channel cut contribution alone fits the tevatron data for @xmath1 production at low @xmath45 , the @xmath0channel cut contribution alone also fits the rhic data on @xmath1 production .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the @xmath0channel @xmath19 cut mechanism for @xmath1 production can be interpreted physically as charm - pair rescattering .",
    "the @xmath0channel cut to the one - loop amplitude with vertex @xmath7 for @xmath24 separates the incoming gluons from the outgoing @xmath1 and gluon . by the cutkosky cutting rules ,",
    "the imaginary part generated by the discontinuity of the amplitude in the variable @xmath0 is the sum over all such cuts .",
    "all the other cuts that contribute to that imaginary part must cut through the vertex @xmath7 .",
    "( the meson @xmath46 cut is not one of these cuts , because it does not separate the incoming lines from the outgoing lines . )",
    "a cutkosky cut through a set of parton lines corresponds to the scattering of @xmath47 into this set of on - shell partons followed by the rescattering of those partons into @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath0channel cut discussed by lck is through @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines , so it corresponds to the scattering of @xmath47 into @xmath49 followed by the rescattering of @xmath49 into @xmath48 .",
    "one misconception in ref .",
    "@xcite ( lck ) is that the meson @xmath19 cut of the amplitude for @xmath1 production should be identified with the color - singlet model contribution . at first glance",
    ", this identification may seem plausible , because the meson cut puts the @xmath15 and @xmath16 on their mass shells and the color - singlet model amplitude is usually calculated by taking the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines to be on their mass shells with 0 relative momentum .",
    "however this identification implies incorrectly that if the arbitrary phase of @xmath7 is chosen so that its dominant contribution is real , the leading color - singlet model contribution is pure imaginary . the color - singlet model amplitude should instead be identified with the contribution from the region of phase space that gives the dominant contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "since the @xmath1 is a nonrelativistic bound state , its primary constituents @xmath15 and @xmath16 have typical relative velocity @xmath4 that is significantly smaller than 1 .",
    "the largest contributions to @xmath7 come from the region in which the @xmath15 and @xmath16 have relative momentum of order @xmath4 in the @xmath1 rest frame and energies that differ by @xmath43 by amounts of order @xmath50 .",
    "calculations in the color - singlet model in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 are on their mass shells with 0 relative momentum should be understood simply as a technical device for calculating the contributions from this dominant region .",
    "if the arbitrary phase of @xmath7 is chosen so that its dominant contribution is real , the leading color - singlet model contribution will also be real .    by presenting the s - channel @xmath19 cut as a leading order contribution",
    ", lck implicitly assumed that the vertex @xmath7 for a @xmath19 pair to form @xmath1 can be treated as if it has a definite order in the qcd coupling constant @xmath40 .",
    "however its order in @xmath40 actually depends on the relative momentum of the @xmath19 pair .",
    "the running coupling constant @xmath51 is small at momentum scales @xmath52 of order @xmath43 and becomes large at small momentum scales .",
    "it is convenient to treat @xmath51 as being of order 1 at small momentum scales @xmath53 .",
    "we then need only count powers of the small running coupling constant @xmath54 from qcd vertices with momentum scale @xmath52 of order @xmath43 and larger .",
    "if the relative momentum of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 is small compared to @xmath43 , then @xmath7 is of order @xmath55 .",
    "we will refer to the vertex @xmath7 in this momentum region as a  soft vertex \" .",
    "if the relative momentum of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is of order @xmath43 , large momentum must be transferred between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 by the exchange of hard gluons with coupling constant @xmath54 in order for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 to bind to form @xmath1 .",
