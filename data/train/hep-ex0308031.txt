    "positronium ( ps ) , the bound state of an electron and a positron , is a purely leptonic system , and the triplet ( @xmath4 ) state of ps , orthopositronium(o - ps ) , decays slowly into three photons .",
    "precise measurement of this decay rate gives us direct information about quantum electrodynamics(qed ) in bound state .",
    "three precision measurements@xcite of the o - ps decay rate were performed at ann arbor , which reported decay rate values much larger , i.e. , 5.2  9.1 experimental standard deviations , than a qed prediction@xcite ( @xmath5 ) corrected up to @xmath3 .",
    "this discrepancy has been referred as ` orthopositronium lifetime puzzle ' , and was long - standing problem . to elucidate discrepancies ,",
    "a variety of experiments have since been carried out to search for the exotic decay mode of o - ps , resulting in no evidence so far @xcite .    as some fraction of o - ps inevitably results in `",
    "pick - off ' annihilations due to collisions with atomic electrons of the target material , the observed o - ps decay rate @xmath6 is a sum of the intrinsic o - ps decay rate @xmath7 and the pick - off annihilation rate into @xmath1 s , @xmath8 , i.e. ,    @xmath9    @xmath10 is proportional to the rate of o - ps collisions with the target materials , i.e. ; @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is product of the density of the target , @xmath13 the annihilation cross - section , and @xmath14 the time dependent velocity of o - ps . due to the thermalization process of o - ps , this necessitates expressing @xmath8 as a function of time whose properties are dependent on the surrounding materials .",
    "thermalization process should be carefully treated even in the cavity experiment@xcite .",
    "although pickoff correction is small in cavities , disappearance of o - ps through the cavity entrance aperture has large contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "this disappearance rate is also proportional to @xmath14 , as the same reason .",
    "since the rate of elastic collision is extremely small in cavities , it takes much time , longer than 1 @xmath15 , to thermalize well , and the disappearance rate still depends strongly on time . in previous measurements@xcite",
    ", @xmath6 s were measured by varying the densities of the target materials , size of the cavities and also the entrance aperture of the cavities .",
    "the extrapolation to zero density or aperture was expected to yield the decay rate in a vacuum , @xmath16 , under the assumption of quick thermalization ( shorter than 170 - 180 nsec ) with constant o - ps velocity .",
    "however , this assumption contains a serious systematic error as pointed out in reference@xcite .",
    "we have proposed the following entirely new method@xcite , which is free from above - mentioned systematic error .",
    "the energy distribution of photons from the 3-body decay is continuous below the steep edge at 511  kev , whereas the pick - off annihilation is 2-body which produces a 511  kev monochromatic peak .",
    "energy and timing information are simultaneously measured with high - energy resolution germanium detectors such that @xmath17 can be determined from the energy spectrum of the emitted photon .",
    "once a precise thermalization function is obtained , @xmath10 will contain all information about the process .",
    "the population of o - ps at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath20 providing the ratio is determined as a function of time , the intrinsic decay rate of o - ps , @xmath16 , can be directly obtained by fitting the observed time spectrum .",
    "we obtained decay rate of @xmath21 and @xmath22 independently@xcite , which are consistent with the non - relativistic qed calculation@xcite , and quite differ from the results obtained at ann arbor@xcite , 7.0482(16)7.0516(13)@xmath23 .",
    "the observed @xmath10 indicates that o - ps thermalization is slow and it is serious systematic problem in all experiments using an extrapolation . in 1998",
    ", they recognized that the incomplete thermalization makes the serious problem in their results@xcite , but they did not update results , and the discrepancy still remaining .",
    "there are also still several problems remained in our result@xcite : ( i ) accuracy was @xmath24 , being worse than those of the other experiments@xcite , ( ii ) there was unknown systematic uncertainties before @xmath25 , and therefore to remove this uncertainty , final results were obtained using data after @xmath26 , and ( iii ) systematic error regarding the stark effect was not estimated .",
    "improving results by considering these problems is described@xcite here , and we report the final result using our new method .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows a diagram of the experimental setup ; a @xmath27 positron source ( dia .",
    ", @xmath28 ) with approximate strength of @xmath29 , being sandwiched between two sheets of plastic scintillators and held by a cone made of aluminized mylar .",
    "the cone was situated at the center of a cylindrical @xmath30-diameter vacuum container made of @xmath31-thick glass , being filled with @xmath32 powder and evacuated down to @xmath33 torr .",
    "two different types of @xmath0 powder were used as listed in table  [ table : powder ] , with the biggest difference being in the mean distance between grains such that different pick - off ratio would be obtained . using these powders ,",
    "two 6-month runs were performed .",
    ".characteristics of @xmath0 powders used in the measurements . [ cols=\"^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ table : systematic ] summarizes estimates of various systematic errors , and the details are shown in reference@xcite .",
    "we just mention here about errors related to simulation and stark effect .",
    "monte carlo simulation related errors : the predominant contribution to total systematic error is produced by uncertain normalization .",
    "that is , the number of pick - off events are determined by subtracting the normalized 3-@xmath34 spectrum of monte carlo simulation from the o - ps spectrum , where changing the normalization factor affects the @xmath17 values and eventually propagates to the final result . since the sharp fall - off of the 3@xmath34-spectrum at 511  kev",
    "is solely produced by the good ge energy resolution of @xmath35  kev , this subtraction only affects the lower side of the pick - off spectrum such that improper subtraction results in asymmetry of the pick - off spectrum shape .",
    "comparison of the asymmetries of the pick - off peak shape and the prompt peak annihilation spectrum is a good parameter for estimating this systematic error .",
    "the 1  @xmath36 error is assessed as @xmath37 .",
    "inhomogeneity of the powder affects on the detection efficiency .",
    "@xmath0 powder density in the mc simulation is conservatively changed by @xmath38 although the uniformity is known to be within a few % ; a change resulting in an error of @xmath39  ppm .",
    "the stark shift stretches the lifetime of ps atoms , i.e. , a perturbative calculation shows that the shift is proportional to a square of the effective electric field @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath40 is defined as the root - mean - square electric field sensed by o - ps during its lifetime .",
    "calculations have estimated two contributions exist based on measurements of the electrical charge - up on the primary grains of silica powders and electrical dipole moment on the surface of grains@xcite .",
    "the charge - up is partly intrinsic depending on powder specifications and partly due to positron depositions from the @xmath43 source .",
    "the effect , however , is negligible in both cases , i.e. , on the level of @xmath44 at most .",
    "silanol functional groups on the surface of the powder grain behave as an electrical dipole moment creating an effective field around the grains .",
    "average densities are measured to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 for run 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the effective field can be analytically calculated such that the contribution to the o - ps decay rate is determined to be @xmath47 for run1 and @xmath48 for run2 .",
    "these estimations were confirmed using results from precise hyper - fine - structure ( hfs ) interval measurements of ground state ps in silica powder@xcite , where the interval is proportional to the size of stark effect . considering the difference in powder densities used , the hfs results are consistent with our estimation .",
    "other sources of systematic errors : error contribution due to the zeeman effect is estimated using the measured absolute magnetic field around the positronium assembly ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "since the 3-@xmath34 pick - off process can only occur at a certain ratio , the calculated relative frequency @xmath50 is consistent with previous measurements@xcite , being @xmath51 for run1 and @xmath52 for run2 .",
    "the probability of the excited state ( n=2 ) of ps is about @xmath53 @xcite , which could make the intrinsic decay rate @xmath54 smaller due to the low decay rate ( @xmath55 )    the above discussed systematic errors are regarded as independent contributions such that the total systematic error can be calculated as their quadratic sum , resulting in @xmath56 , @xmath57 for run1 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 for run2 .",
    "-corrected nrqed prediction .",
    "small vertical lines on the error bars indicate the size of errors solely due to statistics while error bars represent total ambiguities including systematic errors . ]",
    "the decay rate of o - ps formed in @xmath0 was measured using a direct @xmath1 correction method in which the thermalization effect of o - ps is accounted for and integrated into the time spectrum fitting procedure .",
    "consistent results were obtained using two runs with different types of @xmath0 powders , i.e. , and a weighted average gave @xmath60 , which agrees well with our previous result@xcite , it disagrees with results obtained at ann arbor , i.e. , by 3.8@xmath61 @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : history ] , our value agrees well with the nrqed prediction corrected up to @xmath3 term@xcite .",
    "we confirm our results obtained at 1995 and 2000 , and improve accuracy by factor of 1.8 .",
    "just one week before this workshop , ann arbor reported new result@xcite using nanoporous silica film , which produces near - thermal energy o - ps .",
    "they recognized the systematic problem due to unthermalized o - ps ( fast o - ps ) and suppress the kinetic energy of the emitted o - ps using nanoporous silica film and positron beam energy .",
    "they obtain value of @xmath62 , which completely agrees with our results as shown in fig.6 .",
    "so we can conclude that the unthermalized o - ps has contributed large systematic errors of about 1000 ppm and made discrepancy between the qed prediction as pointed out in references@xcite .",
    "now two groups ( two methods ) obtain the consistent results and the orthopositronium lifetime puzzle is clearly solved here .",
    "the combined results of two different methods is @xmath63 , which is not enough accuracy(140ppm ) to examine the @xmath3-correction ( 210ppm ) .",
    "we need much effort to improve accuracy .",
