    "in the currently - favoured hierarchical model of structure formation , clusters of galaxies have formed from the collapse of gravitational potential wells ( e.g. @xcite ) and are powerful cosmological probes .",
    "for instance , since they are sensitive to the expansion history of the universe , their abundance and spatial distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) and their mass function ( e.g. @xcite ) depend on cosmological parameters , such as the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) , or the power spectrum normalisation @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several observational methods now permit the use of clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes , such as x - ray observations , weak gravitational lensing and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "due to improvements in telescopes and techniques , x - ray studies are able to constrain cluster physics and the mass scaling relation with ever greater precision . for instance , the self - similarity for clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) has been observationally verified .",
    "nevertheless , adiabatic simulations still predicts a mass - temperature relation with double the observed normalisation ( e.g. @xcite ) and the self - similarity assumption could break down at low temperatures ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , a steepening of the mass - temperature ( m - t ) relation is expected if galaxy groups underwent a preheating by supernovae , or a surge of entropy , in their early days ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent evidence for this steepening was found by e.g. @xcite , or arnaud , pointecouteau & pratt 2005 ( app05 hereafter ) , but could not be seen by e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , the m - t normalisation estimation is currently limited by systematics in measuring cluster masses from their x - ray profiles .",
    "this limitation can be lifted by using probes which are independent of the physical state of the cluster .    beyond galaxy cluster physics ,",
    "the m - t relation is needed by x - ray experiments to estimate the power spectrum normalisation @xmath5 . measuring",
    "this parameter has triggered much effort in several observational areas .",
    "for instance , cmb experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) tend to a low value for @xmath5 ( @xmath8 ) , weak lensing experiments tend to higher values ( @xmath9 ) , and x - ray observations provide intermediate values .",
    "gravitational lensing does not depend on the underlying physics of clusters of galaxies or dark matter , but only on their potential wells , and on the universe s geometry .",
    "strong gravitational lensing has been used for galaxy clusters physics ( e.g. @xcite ) and measurement of @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "weak gravitational lensing is more difficult to measure ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) ) , and has taken longer to be detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "since then , particular attention has been given to cosmic shear , i.e. statistical cosmological weak lensing ( e.g. @xcite ) , in attempts to measure @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "it has also begun to be used as a tracer of the cosmic web ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a way to detect and catalogue mass overdensities ( e.g. @xcite , gavazzi & soucail 2007 , gs07 hereafter , and @xcite ) . beside the constraints it can bring to cosmology , it can be used as a complement to x - ray analyses of clusters of galaxies . thanks to the physics - independent estimation of cluster masses",
    ", it appears as a unique method to calibrate the mass - temperature relation for clusters of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that the uncertainty in the normalisation of the mass - temperature relation is the largest source of error in @xmath5 measurements inferred from x - ray cluster analyses ( @xcite ) .",
    "an accurate mass - temperature relation , obtained from combined weak lensing and x - ray analyses , will thus provide new insights not only on the @xmath5 discrepancy , but also on galaxy cluster physics .    in this paper , we present the first joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing and x - ray wide - area surveys of a randomly - selected patch of sky .",
    "the weak lensing survey is derived from the cfhtls , and the x - ray survey from the xmm - lss .",
    "the weak lensing analysis uses shapelets ( @xcite ) , a new generation shear measurement technique , which has been shown to achieve a few percent accuracy in shear measurement from ground based telescopes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we analyse one square - degree of the cfhtls deep survey ( the d1 field ) and four contiguous square degrees of the cfhtls wide survey , which enclose the d1 field .",
    "we create convergence maps for this region of the sky and give a catalogue of detections .",
    "we show how counting weak - lensing - selected clusters can provide an estimate of the power spectrum normalisation @xmath5 .",
    "we then show how the combination of weak lensing and x - ray analyses of clusters provides an estimate of the mass - temperature relation normalisation @xmath10 , independent of clusters physical state .",
    "finally , we investigate the impact of a joint weak lensing and x - ray survey strategy on the accuracy of the @xmath5 and @xmath10 measurement .",
    "we consider deep and wide weak lensing surveys , with the cfhtls characteristics , combined with a blind x - ray survey of the same region of the sky .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ data ] presents the surveys used in this paper , namely the cfhtls and the xmm - lss .",
    "the methods that we use are described in section [ method ] .",
    "we show how we estimate the weak lensing effect using shapelets , and how we generate convergence maps and detect clusters .",
    "we also briefly describe how the x - ray properties of clusters are obtained .",
    "section [ results ] presents the convergence map we inferred from our weak lensing analysis , and gives a catalogue of the galaxy clusters that we detect .",
    "we then give our estimates of the normalisation of the power spectrum and of the m - t relation .",
    "we then show in section [ discussion ] that combined blind surveys are necessary to get the best insights about those normalisations .",
    "the impact of survey strategy on those parameters estimations is discussed in section [ impact ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the  canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey \" ( cfhtls ) , a joint france - canada project , consists of three different surveys , namely the very wide survey , the wide synoptic survey ( referred to as  wide survey \" hereafter ) , and the deep survey .",
    "once complete , the wide survey will cover 170 deg@xmath0 ( divided into four distinct patches ranging from 49 deg@xmath0 to 72 deg@xmath0 ) in five filters ( u*,g,r,i,z ) , down to a magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "its main goal is the study of large scale structures by weak gravitational lensing and galaxy counts .",
    "the deep survey covers 4 different fields , each with an area of 1 deg@xmath0 , in the same five filters , down to @xmath12 .",
    "it is primarily intended for type ia supernovae studies but it is also useful for measuring large - scale structures .",
    "the cfhtls images were obtained from observations with the megacam camera , made of a 36 ccd mosaic , of 2048 @xmath13 4196 pixels each , with a 1 deg@xmath0 field of view ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present the weak gravitational lensing based mapping of 4 deg@xmath0 of the wide survey ( w1 patch ) , which include the 1 deg@xmath0 field of the deep survey ( d1 field ) , using both w1 and d1 images . the geometry of the fields that we use is shown in figure [ fig_data ] .",
    "the data processing ( astrometry , photometric calibration , stacking of images ) has been done by the cfht community and terapix .",
    "we use w1 images optimised for weak lensing : each field is the combination of 7 stacked images , each of 620 seconds exposure time .",
    "we use the t0003 release of the d1 field , consisting of 275 stacked images , with a total 37.4 hour exposure time .",
    "the average seeing is 0.7 arcsec .",
    "we masked parts of the images with saturated stars and/or too high a noise , by hand , so as not to bias our weak lensing results .",
    "this operation removes 10% of the original area covered by the data .",
    "we do not mask the ghosts created by spurious reflections on the telescope optics around saturated stars , but we eventually remove the galaxies that they cover from our catalogues , since they are too noisy .",
    "the average galaxy density is 28 arcmin@xmath14 in the d1 image , and 13 arcmin@xmath14 in the w1 images .",
    "designed to cover an area of several tens of square degrees up to a redshift @xmath15 , the xmm - lss survey aims at detecting a significant fraction of clusters of galaxies , in order to constitute a sample suited to cosmological studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "its nominal exposure times are 10 ks , and have been raised up to 20 ks for the _ xmm _ medium deep survey ( xmds : @xcite ) , a 2 deg@xmath0 region included in the xmm - lss , which covers the cfhtls d1 field . in this paper",
    ", we use 4 deg@xmath0 of the xmm - lss which cover our 4 deg@xmath0 cfhtls data .",
    "the _ xmm _",
    "pointings are shown on figure [ fig_data ] .",
    "the raw x - ray observations reduction is presented in @xcite .",
    "introduced in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , shapelets are a complete , orthogonal , set of basis functions with which one can analytically decompose galaxy shapes .",
    "they can be seen as fundamental shapes : a particular galaxy can be represented by a particular sum of shapelets basis functions @xmath16 , weighted by coefficients @xmath17 .",
    "their rich formalism provides an intuitive and analytic form for geometrical transformations ( such as smear , shear , rotation ) and for ( de)convolution .",
    "hence , they allow one to analytically describe the smearing of the point spread function ( psf ) and the shear of galaxies , properly correcting for the psf .",
    "the shear estimation they provide has been shown to reach the needed accuracy for the cfhtls specifications by the step project ( @xcite ) .",
    "our full pipeline will be described in an upcoming paper ( berg et al . in prep ) .",
    "we briefly summarise it here .",
    "each sufficiently bright and non - saturated star is first decomposed into shapelets .",
    "a polynomial interpolation of each shapelet coefficient then provides a model of its spatial variations across the image .",
    "we are thus able to reconstruct the shape of the psf at the position of each galaxy , the condition necessary for deconvolving it from the galaxies shapes .",
    "several stringent tests then validate our psf model .",
    "in particular , we require that the ellipticity distribution , and the two point correlation functions of the ellipticity , of the residuals between observed stars and their shapelet models are consistent with zero .",
    "we also require that the cross - correlation between stars and galaxies ellipticity , when corrected from the psf , is consistent with zero .",
    "the shape of galaxies is finally measured by decomposing them into shapelets , while deconvolving from the psf , as shown in @xcite .",
    "a shear estimator is created from the shapelet decompositions of galaxies , as prescribed by @xcite :    @xmath18    where the shear susceptibility @xmath19 is fitted on the magnitude - size plane for galaxies .",
    "the coefficients are complex numbers .",
    "the shear @xmath20 of equation ( [ gamma ] ) is the complex notation for shears , @xmath21 .",
    "to increase the signal to noise ratio of our measurements , we give to each galaxy @xmath22 a minimum variance weight @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the error on shape measurement for galaxy @xmath22 , @xmath25 the error on the measurement of its shear susceptibility , and @xmath26 is the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion , set to @xmath27 . slightly changing @xmath26",
    "would be equivalent to giving more or less weight to our measurement errors , and would mostly affect the error bars in the shear measurement .",
    "the eventual peak detection would not be affected by such slight changes .",
    "this weighting scheme is equivalent to smoothly selecting the most useful galaxies for shear measurement .",
    "for instance , the faintest are down - weighted .",
    "it therefore provides us with effective densities of @xmath28 and @xmath29 useful galaxies per square arcminute , in the d1 and w1 images , respectively .",
    "then , a direct inversion in fourier space of the pixelised shear map allows us to infer a convergence ( i.e. projected mass ) map ( @xcite ) of the images",
    ". structures in this mass map are extracted from the noise using a gaussian filter .",
    "figures [ massmapw1 ] and [ massmap ] show the convergence maps that we inferred from our data .",
    "these are described in section [ catalogue ] .",
    "while constructing a convergence map , we also create a signal - to - noise map , the signal - to - noise ratio being defined as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the convergence at the ( @xmath32 ) sky coordinates , and @xmath33 its r.m.s error .",
    "the r.m.s error @xmath33 is computed using monte - carlo simulations in which the input galaxies are positioned like the observed ones but with randomised shape orientations .",
    "structures are then searched for in the filtered convergence map , and their astrometry provided , by the sextractor software ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are extracted according to their signal - to - noise peak , read from the signal - to - noise map .",
    "hereafter , we define a ` significant structure ' as a detection with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 2.5 . their mass is related to their integrated convergence through the lensing geometry , and can be estimated when their redshift and the redshift distribution of background galaxies are known . to account for the latter , we use the normalised distribution    @xmath34\\ ] ]    where the parameters @xmath35 are given for the wide images by @xcite @xmath36 .",
    "to account for @xmath37 in the d1 image , we fit @xcite s photometric redshift distribution in the cfhtls d1 field , and obtain @xmath38 . @xcite",
    "have shown that errors in the @xmath37 fit are subdominant compared to poisson noise and sample variance for the measurement of cosmological parameters .",
    "we thus neglect them hereafter .",
    "we measure a cluster s virial mass by averaging its convergence in an aperture large enough that we can assume that the entire cluster is captured .",
    "the aperture corresponds to the region enclosed in the 2@xmath39 level of the cluster s convergence map .",
    "this technique is similar to using a @xmath40-statistic ( @xcite ) , with infinitely large annulus around the cluster , provided that the convergence in the entire field averages to 0 .",
    "we verified this latter point , thus validating our choice .",
    "note that because of the small number density of background sources , we can not reliably fit a shear profile around clusters ( see e.g. @xcite for an example of mass estimation using two profile fits around the galaxy cluster abell 209 ) .",
    "we then convert the virial mass into @xmath41 , the mass enclosed in the sphere of mean overdensity 200 times higher than the critical density , using the recipe from @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will note @xmath41 more briefly @xmath42 .",
    "weak lensing is affected by the entire mass distribution along the line of sight . as a result",
    ", the weak lensing mass measurement of one cluster is biased by projection effects .",
    "it has been shown , using different mass estimators , that large - scale structures in the line of sight , and near the target cluster , introduce errors ranging from a few percent ( @xcite ) to a few tens of percent ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume that they produce a 20% error , added in quadrature to the shear measurement error .",
    "the x - ray cluster detection pipeline has been described in @xcite .",
    "it takes account of the poisson nature of the x - ray images , to extract and analyse clusters of galaxies in a two - step procedure .",
    "clusters are first detected by a multi - resolution wavelet filter ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , each source is analysed using a maximum likelihood profile fitting procedure , and its x - ray properties assessed .",
    "three classes of extended sources have been defined ( @xcite ) : ( 1 ) the c1 class contains the highest surface brightness sources , and is uncontaminated ; ( 2 ) the c2 class allows for 50 % contamination , and contains less bright extended sources ; ( 3 ) finally , the c3 class contains optically confirmed sources with apparent x - ray emission , that were not selected as c1 or c2 . in this paper",
    ", we only consider c1 class detections , representative of the most massive objects seen in the xmm - lss .",
    "the redshift of detected clusters has been measured using spectroscopic observations from a number of telescope and instrument combinations detailed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "their temperature estimation is described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite have extracted and analysed 29 c1 clusters from 5 deg@xmath0 of the xmm - lss data ( shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_data ] ) , that contain our 4 deg@xmath0 optical data . among other things ,",
    "they have measured their luminosity and temperature . here , we take into account their 16 clusters which are enclosed in the fields of our cfhtls data , making use only of their temperature and redshift . they are listed in table [ cataloguetable ] .",
    "note that the cluster xlssc053 is in the g12 xmm - lss pointing ( shown by the cross in the d1 field , on fig .",
    "[ fig_data ] ) , which was not used when @xcite analysed the xmm - lss observations .",
    "this pointing has been re - observed , and the x - ray characteristics of xlssc053 are listed in table [ cataloguetable ] .",
    "in this section , we give the properties of clusters of galaxies detected with our weak lensing pipeline .",
    "counting the weak lensing detections allows us to constrain the matter power spectrum normalisation @xmath5 .",
    "we then use the weak lensing mass of the detected groups to calibrate the mass - temperature relation for clusters of galaxies .",

    "we found that for experiments driven by exposure time constraints , a wide survey will give @xmath135 3 times lower errors on the estimates of both @xmath5 and @xmath10 . to secure the measurement of @xmath5 and @xmath3 with the current statistical accuracy , a 200 deg@xmath0 and a",
    "300 deg@xmath0 wide surveys will be needed respectively .",
    "we finally found that a 7000 deg@xmath0 wide survey will be able to reach the 1% accuracy both on the power spectrum and mass - temperature relation normalisations .",

    "<S> we present a joint weak lensing and x - ray analysis of 4 deg@xmath0 from the cfhtls and xmm - lss surveys . </S>",
    "<S> our weak lensing analysis is the first analysis of a real survey using shapelets , a new generation weak lensing analysis method . </S>",

    "<S> we show that their counts can be used to constrain the power spectrum normalisation @xmath1 for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that despite the large scatter generally observed in the m - t relation derived from lensing masses , tight constraints on both its slope and normalisation @xmath3 can be obtained with a moderate number of sources provided that the covered mass range is large enough . adding clusters from @xcite to our sample , we measure @xmath4 . although they are dominated by shot noise and sample variance , our measurements are consistent with currently favoured values , and set the stage for future surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we thus investigate the dependence of those estimates on survey size , depth , and integration time , for joint weak lensing and x - ray surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we show that deep surveys should be dedicated to the study of the physics of clusters and groups of galaxies . for a given exposure time </S>",
    "<S> , wide surveys provide a larger number of detected clusters and are therefore preferred for the measurement of cosmological parameters such as @xmath5 and @xmath3 . </S>",
