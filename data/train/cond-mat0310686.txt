    "soft materials are often subjugated into classes :  colloids , polymers , or emulsions \" , or  liquid crystals , membranes , or foams \" .",
    "while these systems all share common mechanical and energetic scales , each subfield has developed its own set of theoretical tools , often required and inspired by real - world applications .",
    "recently  @xcite we have combined ideas from these subfields to study colloids which , in addition to the standard excluded - volume interactions , softly repel each other , either through a surface polymer coating ( `` fuzzy '' )  @xcite or via a screened coulomb interaction  @xcite . while free - volume theory provides remarkably accurate accounting of the free energy of packing the hard cores  @xcite , additional pair interactions are hard to implement analytically to determine in detail the phase behavior of these systems . we have argued that soft repulsion favors larger separations between the colloid surfaces which , in turn , implies that the area of the ( mathematical ) interface partitioning the voronoi cells of each colloid should be a minimum  @xcite . employing this idea and borrowing from the physics of foams ,",
    "we have successfully understood the phase diagrams of these and other systems with similar morphologies , _",
    "e.g. _ dendritic polymers  @xcite , diblock copolymers  @xcite and star polymers  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this analogy in order to determine the elastic properties of these materials when assembled into three lattices of interest : the face - centered cubic lattice ( fcc ) , which maximizes the packing density of hard spheres  @xcite , the body - centered cubic lattice ( bcc ) , which minimizes the overlap volume of spheres which cover space  @xcite , and the a15 lattice , which is conjectured to minimize the interfacial area of the voronoi cells  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , there exists a considerable body of experimental data and facts on many of these colloidal systems : from crystallographic data  @xcite to charged systems  @xcite and lyotropic systems  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of data can be attributed in part to the relative ease of manipulating colloidal systems by chemical means in the laboratory , and the resulting systems can be readily analyzed using optical techniques  @xcite .",
    "in fact , colloidal systems would serve as an ideal experimental playground provided that a recipe exists that would enable predictions of their external mechanical , thermal and electrical properties as functions of internal variables such as the size of colloidal particles and the form of interparticle interaction .",
    "prior efforts have been made to understand these colloidal systems from first principles .",
    "the more traditional routes include molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite or analytical methods like the density functional approach  @xcite .",
    "while these tools have proven important in our current understanding , they do not provide a robust explanation of the stability of colloidal crystals .",
    "our analogy with the physics of foams provides a unifying explanation of non - close - packed structures in fuzzy colloids and charged polystyrene spheres . in both of these systems",
    "the interaction potential consists of a hard core decorated with a  soft \" , purely repulsive part . in dendrimers , for instance",
    ", the hard core is composed of the aromatic internal part of the micelle - forming conical macromolecules , and the soft corona comes from the interdigitated alkyl chains of the outer part of the micelles  @xcite .",
    "the charged colloids , on the other hand , consist of polystyrene spheres and the soft repulsive tail is their short - range , screened coulomb potential .    in what follows ,",
    "we summarize the main concepts behind the foam analogy in section ii .",
    "we see that geometry provides a natural setting to relate the microscopic properties of colloids such as lattice spacing or interparticle interaction to phase diagrams delineating macroscopic and thermal properties of these systems . in section iii , we extend this foam analogy to study the elastic properties of these materials by considering small perturbations to the `` foams '' .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we sketch the salient features of the mapping between fuzzy colloids and foams . when studying the interactions of spheres , one limit is to treat them as point particles with infinite curvature .",
    "our approach is the other extreme : we treat the interactions between the spheres as if they are between flat , zero - curvature surfaces .",
    "if the system contains only one type of particle , we may divide the volume into equal volume cells , each singly occupied . at fixed density , the volume of the system is the volume of the hard cores and the excess volume of either the salt solution in charged systems or the soft chains within the corona in fuzzy colloids . since this latter volume can be viewed as enveloping the individual spheres , we imagine breaking the volume up into a lattice of voronoi cells , each of which contains a colloidal particle",
    ". the excess volume can then be written , by definition , as the product of the area of these dividing surfaces and their average thickness . since the volume of the hard cores and the volume of the whole system is fixed at a given density , the excess volume is also constant and so : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is total area of these bilayers and @xmath2 is their average thickness .",
    "the excess volume depends on the particle density of the system . using simple geometrical considerations ,",
    "the volume per particle subtracting the volume of each particle is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , depends on the lattice type ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and is a dimensionless quantity characterizing the magnitude of area .    given the repulsive nature of both types of systems , the surfaces of the hard cores within each voronoi cell would like to be as far apart from one another as possible .",
    "maximizing @xmath2 to reduce the repulsive interaction amounts to minimizing @xmath8 and we are thus led to consider kelvin s problem  @xcite of partitioning space into equal volume cells having the smalled interfacial area .",
    "it follows that the soft repulsion favors the bcc lattice over the fcc lattice  @xcite and the a15 lattice over both  @xcite .",
    "the total free energy of the system can be divided into two contributions : a bulk part due to the positional entropy of the hard cores in the voronoi cells , and an interfacial part due to the surface interactions between neighboring cells .",
    "other than its heuristic nature , the main advantage of our geometrical approach lies in the fact that although it incorporates only nearest - neighbor effects , our calculations have a many - body character since both maximization of the packing density and minimization of the interfacial area are global rather than local problems .    to compute the bulk free energy of the system ,",
    "we employ cellular free - volume theory  @xcite . in this approximation , each particle is confined to a cage formed by its neighbors .",
    "the free volume available to each particle s center of mass is the volume of the wigner - seitz cell after a layer of thickness @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the hard - core diameter of particles ) is peeled off of its faces . since the volume of the wigner - seitz cell depends only on the symmetry of the lattice , the bulk free energy encodes information on the geometry of the system .",
    "it turns out that the free volume theory yields good quantitative agreement with available numerical simulations at high densities in spite of its mean - field nature  @xcite . at lower densities ,",
    "as long as the shear elastic constants are non - zero , we expect that an `` einstein - crystal '' description of the phonon modes should be adequate",
    ". indeed , for the systems in which we are interested , the appropriate moduli are all non - zero in the density regime we are probing  @xcite : therefore there should be no `` soft modes '' which might otherwise contribute strongly to collective effects .",
    "the use of the free volume theory results in the following expression for the bulk free energy of the fcc or bcc lattice : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the reduced density and @xmath10 is the hard - core diameter of each colloidal particle . the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on the shape of the cells , whereas @xmath15 and @xmath16 are determined by their size .",
    "the bulk free energy expression for the a15 lattice is slightly more complicated but still amenable to an approximate analytical form  @xcite : @xmath17 . \\label{fa15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this formula best agrees with the numerical results obtained within the cellular theory for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ fbulk ] ) and ( [ fa15 ] ) shows that the free volume theory predicts that at reduced densities below about @xmath20 , the a15 lattice of hard spheres should become more stable than the fcc lattice , which is physically inadmissible .",
    "however , this is not essential since a pure hard - core system melts at reduced densities below @xmath21 .",
    "we note that this anomaly is not an artifact of the approximations behind eq .",
    "( [ fa15 ] ) ; instead , it provides us with a conservative estimate for the range of validity of the cellular theory in this system .",
    "the interfacial free energy of the system , on the other hand , incorporates the specific nature of interparticle interactions at the microscopic level . for charged systems ,",
    "the interaction is the screened coulomb potential . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the debye - hckel approximation and a derjaguin - like approximation are both used to obtain the interfacial free energy : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bulk counterion number density , @xmath24 is the dimensionless surface potential of colloids , @xmath25 is the colloid density , and the debye screening length is @xmath26 , itself a function of these control variables ( where @xmath27 is the dielectric constant ) .    for fuzzy colloids , an argument based on flory theory of the highly compressed polymer brushes  @xcite yields : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a parameter with the dimension of length that determines the strength of repulsion , @xmath30 is the number of alkyl chains per micelle , and @xmath31 , the thickness of the corona , is half the average thickness of the interdigitated matrix of the chains , @xmath2 . in both systems ,",
    "maximization of surface spacing @xmath2 implies the minimization of the interfacial area @xmath32 . from eq .",
    "( [ area ] ) , the density of particles enter directly into the energies of the system through the minimal - area constraint .",
    "however , the functional dependence on the particle density differs between them : for the charged colloids , we have a short - range exponential interaction while for the fuzzy colloids we have an algebraic interaction , valid at ranges smaller than the thickness of an uncompressed coronal brush .",
    "the bulk and interfacial free energies together express the thermodynamics of colloidal systems in a geometrical language .",
    "the formalism directly establishes relations between microscopic parameters governing the dynamics of the colloidal particles and the stability of various macroscopic phases with respect to temperature  @xcite .",
    "one can conceivably adapt eqs .",
    "( [ fbulk ] ) , ( [ fa15 ] ) , ( [ finterfacial ] ) , and ( [ ffuzzy ] ) to other kinds of lattice geometry , and the foam analogy can correspondingly be applied to studying the various solid phases of colloidal systems . in the following section we will consider lattices which can be attained through shearing the fcc , bcc and a15 lattices .",

    "the shear modulus , on the other hand , generally depends on the direction of the applied strain and ranges from deformations along the four - fold axis ( elongational shear ) , @xmath41 , to deformations along the face diagonal ( simple shear ) , @xmath38 . to determine the bulk modulus as well as the three elastic constants",

    "the bulk elastic energies can be found via a simple numerical scheme by deforming the unit cell and calculating the resulting free volume of the colloidal particle . at this point",
    ", we note that this approach reproduces the well - known shear instability of the bcc lattice of hard spheres .",
    "shear along a four - fold axis , called the bain strain , reduces the bulk free energy and leads eventually to an fcc lattice via a continuous sequence of body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattices .",

    "since our derjaguin - like approximation only accounts for nearest neighbors , it is not reliable for @xmath66 of order 1 . thus we expect that the peaks in the moduli mark the crossover at which the nearest neighbor approximation breaks down .",

    "it follows that the shear moduli of the charged colloids are considerably smaller than the bulk moduli .",
    "if we consider the results for @xmath38 , for instance , we see that the modulus is largest in the fcc lattice , and significantly smaller for the a15 lattice .",
    "this is similar to the case of hard spheres for which it is well known that the bcc lattice is unstable with respect to shear along the four - fold axis .",
    "it is conceivable that for the non - closed packed lattices , there exist pockets of unoccupied space that become available upon shear which would allow an overall lowering of the elastic free energy .",
    "the effects of lattice distortion are less noticeable in the bcc and a15 lattices due to the greater availability of space for each lattice site .",
    "physically , this property translates into the observed fact that the bcc and a15 lattices are much softer and much more amenable to shear deformations .",
    "the softening of the bcc shear moduli in comparison to the fcc ones has in fact been seen in md studies of the fcc lattice of copper  @xcite and of the bcc lattice of vanadium  @xcite .    in the case of the a15 lattice ( fig .",
    "[ a15shear ] ) , there is an interesting shear mode .",
    "this lattice has two distinct sites : pairs of columnar sites are located at bisectors of the faces of the unit cell , forming three sets of mutually perpendicular columns , and interstitial sites are at the vertices and at the center of the unit cell .",
    "[ a15shear]a shows a side view of the a15 lattice in the close - packing limit , which is determined by the density at which the columnar spheres touch each other  the interstitial sites are still far from their neighbors . there is a shear mode that can exploit this excess volume :",

    "the columnar sites now no longer touch one another , and the free energy is thus lowered in this configuration .",
    "however , as the shear increases , the columnar sites touch the interstitial sites and there can be no more distortion .",

    "this is qualitatively different from the shear instability of the bcc lattice , which is unstable at all densities .     for the fcc , bcc , and a15 lattices of a fuzzy colloidal system as a function of density @xmath25 , at `` screening '' length @xmath74 .",

    "since there is no mechanism that would prefer shear along either of the three faces of the a15 unit cell , the actual instability experienced by the system should preserve the equivalence of the columnar sites .",
    "thus it should include equal amounts of shear along all three faces , which corresponds to shear along the body diagonal .",
    "the resulting structure belongs to the triclinic system , since the edges of the sheared unit cell are no longer perpendicular to one another .",
    "however , the sheared lattice is a special triclinic lattice because the edges of the unit cell are of equal length and the angles between them are identical .",

    "<S> by mapping the interactions of colloidal particles onto the problem of minimizing areas , the physics of foams can be used to understand the phase diagrams of both charged and fuzzy colloids . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this analogy to study the elastic properties of such colloidal crystals and consider the face - centered cubic , body - centered cubic and a15 lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two types of soft interparticle potentials corresponding to charged and fuzzy colloids , respectively , and we analyze the dependence of the elastic constants on density as well as on the parameters of the potential . we show that the bulk moduli of the three lattices are generally quite similar , and that the shear moduli of the two non - close - packed lattices are considerably smaller than in the face - centered cubic lattice . we find that in charged colloids , the elastic constants are the largest at a finite screening length , and we discuss a shear instability of the a15 lattice . </S>"
