    "the kingman coalescent is a classical model in mathematical population genetics used for describing the genealogies for a wide class of population models ( see e.g @xcite ) .",

    "one particular example is the moran model ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is a stationary continuous - time model for populations of fixed size @xmath0 in which the reproduction takes place according to the following rule : starting with a population of size @xmath0 , after an exponential time of parameter @xmath2 a pair of individuals is picked uniformly at random from the population , out of which one individual dies and the other one gives birth to one child .",
    "the ancestry of a moran population of size @xmath0 started at time @xmath3 is at any time @xmath4 described by the kingman @xmath0-coalescent .",
    "this is a process with values in the set of partitions of @xmath5 which starts in the partition in singletons and has the following dynamics ( backwards in time ) : given the process is in state @xmath6 , it jumps at rate @xmath7 to a state @xmath8 which is obtained by merging two randomly chosen elements of @xmath6 .",
    "the process can be represented graphically as a binary rooted tree which , when traced back from its @xmath0 leaves ( and correspondingly @xmath0 _ external branches _ ) , exhibits a binary merger at rate @xmath7 while there are @xmath9 branches left .",
    "one particular feature of coalescent trees that has been intensively investigated in the literature , due to its relevance in statistical studies of genetic data , is their total length ( the sum of the lengths of all the branches of the tree ) . in the case of",
    "the kingman coalescent tree started with @xmath0 leaves the total length is in expectation equal to twice the harmonic number @xmath10 and when @xmath0 tends to infinity ( half of ) the total length compensated by @xmath11 converges in law to a gumbel distributed random variable .",
    "in the case of coalescent processes with multiple mergers the total length has been studied in various papers , for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as time @xmath1 increases the moran population evolves and its genealogy changes , giving rise to a tree - valued process @xmath12 , the _ evolving kingman @xmath0-coalescent_. the associated process of total tree length was investigated in @xcite .",
    "( see also the more recent papers @xcite and @xcite on the evolution of the total length in the multiple merger case . )",

[ fig_tree ]    the weak convergence can be lifted to convergence in probability , provided a representation for moran populations on the same probability space for all population sizes @xmath21 is considered . such a representation is given by the _",

    "the proof of proposition  3.2 in @xcite is based on the equality in law of the processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in sec .",
    "2 below we include an argument why this equality in law is valid .    the question that we address in this paper is one formulated in @xcite , namely whether @xmath20 is a semimartingale ( i.e. whether it can be written as a sum of a local martingale and a process of locally finite variation that are both adapted to the same filtration ) , and thus would be an instance for the classical tools of stochastic analysis .",
    "a necessary condition for a cdlg process to be a semimartingale is that its quadratic variation is a.s .",
    "finite , see e.g. @xcite theorem  ii.22 . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the process @xmath20 has `` infinite infinitesimal variance '' , more precisely , @xmath29\\to 4 $ ] as @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the squared increments @xmath31 are for small @xmath32 ( at least in expectation ) of a larger order than @xmath32 , which suggests that @xmath33 should not have finite quadratic variation .",
    "we will show that indeed @xmath20 has a.s",
    ". infinite quadratic variation ( and hence can not be a semimartingale ) .",
    "this will be achieved by investigating the jumps of the process  @xmath24 .",
    "let us now give a brief description of the look - down construction and explain heuristically our approach . a formal description of the look - down graph",
    "will then be given in the next section .",
    "the main idea behind the look - down representation is to label the individuals in the population according to the persistence ( or longevity ) of their offspring : label 1 for the individual with the most persistent progeny , 2 for the second and so on .",
    "[ fig_ld ]    we consider a system of countably many particles describing the sample genealogies ordered by persistence . at any time , each _ level _ 1,2,  is occupied by precisely one particle , and the system evolves as follows : for every pair @xmath34 at rate 1 the particle currently at level @xmath35 shoots an arrow towards level @xmath9 , independently of everything else . at this time",
    "the particle at level @xmath35 gives birth to a new particle which is placed at level @xmath9 , while for each @xmath36 the particle located at level @xmath37 changes its level from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . to each birth event",
    "we associate a _ line _ which records the time evolution of the levels occupied by the new - born particle ( see the graphical representation in figure [ fig_ld ] ) .",
    "this line is pushed up to the next level each time a birth event happens on a level to the left of the current level of the line .",
    "we say that the line ends ( dies ) at the time it reaches level @xmath39 .",
    "the countable system of all the lines ( including the immortal line that sits at level 1 ) makes up the look - down graph with infinitely many levels ( or _ infinite look - down graph _ for short ) ; the corresponding representation for a particle system of finite size @xmath0 is obtained by projecting the infinite look - down graph onto the first @xmath0 levels .",
    "when considering the system with @xmath0 particles only , we say that a line dies when it is pushed out of level @xmath0 . like in the case of the moran model , the realizations of the sample genealogy can be read off from the look - down graph .    for a line @xmath40 in the infinite look - down graph",
    "we denote by @xmath41 its _ life - length _ ,",
    "i.e. the time span between the birth and the death time of @xmath40 .",
    "if we restrict the graph to its first @xmath0 levels , then @xmath42 , the _ life - length of the line up to @xmath0 _ will denote the time span the line needs until it exits level @xmath0 . in terms of trees ,",
    "the life - length of a line that dies at some time @xmath1 in the look - down graph with @xmath0 levels corresponds to the length of the external branch that falls off the genealogical tree at time @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the jumps of the ( compensated ) tree length process @xmath27 happen at the times lines exist level @xmath0 in the @xmath0-look - down graph and they have sizes equal to the life - lengths up to @xmath0 of these lines . hence for @xmath43 we can write @xmath44 where the sum is taken over all lines @xmath40 that exit level @xmath0 in the time interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "it was proved in @xcite ( see proposition 3.1 and the proof of proposition 6.1 therein ) that for any fixed times @xmath43 @xmath46 holds in @xmath47 , and therefore almost surely along a subsequence @xmath48 .",
    "let us now consider the lines in the infinite look - down graph that die in the time interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "for every such line there exists an @xmath0 such that for all @xmath49 this line exits from level @xmath50 in the time interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "conversely , for any line that exits at level @xmath39 in the complement of the time interval @xmath45 $ ] there exists an @xmath0 such for all @xmath49 that this line does not exit from level @xmath50 in the time interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "therefore , with probability one , it is the life - lengths up to @xmath51 of precisely those lines that reach level @xmath39 in @xmath45 $ ] , which appear as summands on the right - hand side of ( [ jump_n ] ) for large enough @xmath9 , and thus contribute to the limit @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the jumps of the limiting process @xmath24 that occur in @xmath45 $ ] one key issue is to understand the behaviour of the life - lengths of the lines that die in the infinite look - down graph in this time interval .",
    "the following theorem on the squared life - lengths of these lines is the central ingredient for proving our main result , which is stated in theorem [ main_th ] below .",
    "[ sec_th ] for any @xmath43 the sum of the squared life - lengths of the lines that die in the time interval @xmath45 $ ] in the infinite look - down graph is almost surely infinite .",
    "[ main_th ] the kingman tree length process @xmath20 has a.s . infinite quadratic variation .",

    "we will prove theorem [ main_th ] for @xmath24 in place of @xmath20 .",
    "this is sufficient , since @xmath24 and @xmath20 are equal in law .",
    "a key ingredient in the proof of theorem [ sec_th ] is the proposition stated below .",
    "this result is also of interest in its own right since it sheds light on the overall structure of the look - down graph and the large amount of independence which is built into it . from the brief description of the look - down graph given above ( and from the formal definition provided in the next section )",
    "it is immediate that the birth times of lines on some level @xmath58 in the look - down graph form a poisson process with rate @xmath59 .",
    "it turns out that the death times of these lines are also points of a poisson process with the same rate . for the particular case @xmath60 two different proofs of this result",
    "were given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ prop_poisson ] in the infinite look - down graph , for every @xmath61 , @xmath62 consider the process @xmath63 of time points at which the lines that were born at level @xmath9 reach level @xmath39 .",
    "the processes @xmath63 are mutually independent poisson with rate @xmath59 . for each @xmath64 the process @xmath24 has a jump in each of the points of @xmath63 .",
    "the size @xmath65 of this jump is equal to the life - length @xmath66 of the line @xmath40 that dies at this time point ( see the proof of theorem [ main_th ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize that even though the jump times of @xmath24 are independent , @xmath24 is not a lvy process , because there are dependencies in the jump sizes .",
    "moreover , the integrability condition @xmath67 } h^2\\nu(dh)<\\infty$ ] , which must be satisfied by a lvy measure , is violated by the jump intensity measure of @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , the expectation of the life - length @xmath66 of a line born at level @xmath9 is @xmath68 ( see below ) and for large @xmath9 the distribution of @xmath66 is concentrated around @xmath68 ( see the proof of theorem [ sec_th ] , which uses a result of @xcite ) . since the points of @xmath63 come at rate @xmath59 , the jump intensity measure of @xmath24 has ( for large @xmath9 ) mass @xmath59 concentrated around @xmath68 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "part of the strategy of the proof of our main result reflects in the simple fact that @xmath69 .",
    "the _ look - down _ construction of donnelly and kurtz ( @xcite , @xcite ) is an alternative way of representing the evolution of moran ( and more general exchangeable ) populations , which proves to be a very powerful instrument in investigating population dynamics . as already mentioned in the introduction , this representation of populations of sizes @xmath0",
    "is done on one and the same probability space for all @xmath21 in such a way that the path - wise consistency of the genealogies is ensured as @xmath16 .",
    "the main idea of the look - down representation is the labeling of the individuals according to the persistence of their offspring in the population . in the first paper @xcite the persistence of the offspring",
    "is taken to hold in probability , whereas in the `` modified '' look - down construction introduced in @xcite , this holds almost surely .",
    "we will use this second version of the model which we describe below following @xcite .",
    "we consider a population of infinite size and denote by @xmath70 the set @xmath71 .",
    "an element @xmath72 in @xmath70 denotes the individual that occupies level @xmath35 at time @xmath73 .",
    "the levels represent indices given to the individuals in the population according to the persistence of their offspring in the following way : the offspring of the individual that lives at time @xmath73 at level @xmath35 almost surely outlives the offspring of any other individual alive at time @xmath73 on a level @xmath74 .",
    "the process evolves as follows : to every pair of levels @xmath75 with @xmath34 we attach a ( rate one ) poisson point process on @xmath76 which we denote by @xmath77 .",
    "all these poisson point processes are independent . each time",
    "the clock @xmath77 rings , level @xmath9 _ looks down _ to level @xmath35 , that is , the current individual at level @xmath35 reproduces and its offspring is placed at level @xmath9 . for @xmath62 and @xmath78 we associate with the individual born at time @xmath79 at level @xmath9 the set of points @xmath80 where @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "we call @xmath40 the _ line _ born at time @xmath79 at level @xmath9 and say that at time @xmath83 the line is pushed from level @xmath84 to level @xmath85 .",
    "note that a line is pushed one level upwards every time one of the poisson point processes associated with levels smaller than or equal to the current level of the line experiences an event .",
    "lines are born on a level @xmath86 at the times of a poisson point process with rate @xmath87 and a line at level @xmath9 is pushed up with rate @xmath7 because there are @xmath7 independent ( rate one ) poisson point processes which trigger the look - down between the levels that are smaller than or equal to @xmath9 .",
    "we say that a line dies when it reaches level infinity and denote the death time of line @xmath40 by @xmath88 since the rate at which a line is born at a level bigger than or equal to 2 is pushed up is quadratical , we conclude that the time it takes for a line to die is finite almost surely .",
    "level @xmath89 is never hit by arrows and therefore the offspring of the individuals living on this level persist forever in the population .",
    "we call the line @xmath90 _ the immortal line_.    the set of all the lines is countable and it forms a partition of @xmath70 .",
    "the random graph obtained in this way is called the _ look - down graph _ ( with infinitely many levels ) .",
    "this graph records the evolution of a population of infinite size .",
    "embedded in the look - down process are all the @xmath0-particle look - down processes corresponding to populations of sizes @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0-particle look - down process is constructed in a similar way , but the graph has only @xmath0 levels and we say that a line dies when it exits level @xmath0 . any @xmath0-particle look - down process can be recovered as the projection of the infinite look - down process on the first @xmath0 levels .",
    "the ordering by persistence ( corresponding to the direction of the arrows from left to right in figure [ fig_ld ] ) induces an asymmetry in the look - down graph : the offspring size of an individual with a lower level tends to be larger than that of an individual with a larger level .",
    "nevertheless , the ancestral process back from a fixed time @xmath1 that is induced by the random look - down graph is the kingman coalescent . in order to see this , consider two lines @xmath40 and @xmath91 . for @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94",
    "we say that @xmath95 is the _ ancestor _ of @xmath96 and we write @xmath97 if either the two lines are the same or there are some lines @xmath98 such that @xmath99 descends from @xmath40 , @xmath100 descends from @xmath101 , for @xmath102 and @xmath91 descends from @xmath103 .",

    "it is not difficult to check that for each @xmath1 the restriction @xmath110 of @xmath111 to @xmath5 is equal in law to the @xmath0-kingman coalescent @xmath112 , when both are viewed as metric trees .",
    "the consistency property then implies that the genealogy @xmath111 of the infinite population has the distribution of the kingman coalescent @xmath113 .",
    "the trees @xmath110 and @xmath114 come with a labeling of their leaves by @xmath115 , which in the case of @xmath110 corresponds to the levels .",
    "it is important to note that , for @xmath116 , the tree length processes @xmath117 and @xmath118 have the same distribution , even though for @xmath119 the distributions of the leaf - labeled metric tree - valued processes @xmath120 and @xmath121 are different .",
    "as already stated above , for any fixed time @xmath1 , the distribution of @xmath110 equals that of @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , this distribution is _ exchangeable _ , i.e. invariant under a permutation of the labels . if one considers instead of the leaf - labeled trees the _ unlabeled trees _",
    "( i.e. the equivalence classes of leaf - labeled trees under all permutations of the labeling ) , then it is clear how the moran dynamics acts on these unlabeled trees : after an exponential time with parameter @xmath123 ( at time @xmath124 , say ) a pair of leaves is chosen completely at random , one of them to die , which results in the removal of the external branch that is below the leaf that dies at time  @xmath124 , and the other to be parental , which results in two leaves having distance @xmath125 at time @xmath124 .",
    "( a  formal description of this so - called _ tree - valued moran dynamics of population size @xmath0 _ is given in @xcite , def .",
    "2.18 . ) with the look - down dynamics acting on the trees whose leaves are labeled by the levels , it is always the leaf at level @xmath0 that dies , and compared to the moran dynamics there is a bias towards the lower levels in the choice of the parental leaf .",
    "however , because the distribution of @xmath126 ( like that of @xmath110 ) is invariant under permutations of the labels , the choice from the labeled leaves of @xmath126 ( in spite of its bias ) amounts to a uniform choice of a pair of leaves from the unlabeled tree that corresponds to @xmath126 .",
    "( more formally , for a leaf - labeled tree @xmath127 , denote the unlabeled tree obtained from @xmath127 by @xmath128 , and write @xmath129 for the look - down transition probability in one reproduction step starting from @xmath127 .",
    "also , for an unlabeled tree @xmath130 , denote by @xmath131 the uniform distribution on the @xmath132 leaf - labeled trees in the equivalence class described by @xmath130 , and write @xmath133 for the moran transition probability on the unlabeled trees in one reproduction step starting from @xmath127 . what we have just explained amounts to the relation @xmath134 , which is one of the two criteria in theorem 2 of @xcite . the other criterion in this theorem ( requiring that @xmath135 ) is clearly satisfied .",
    "hence , this theorem yields ( first for the chains embedded at the reproduction times and then also for the processes in continuous time ) that @xmath136 is a markov process whose transitions are given by @xmath137 . ) altogether , this shows that the lookdown dynamics yields the same markovian projection on the unlabeled trees as the moran dynamics .",
    "since the tree length is a functional of the unlabeled tree , this shows that @xmath117 and @xmath118 have the same distribution .    with a view towards the jumps of @xmath24 ,",
    "in the look - down graph with infinitely many levels let us consider a line @xmath40 born at level @xmath138 .",
