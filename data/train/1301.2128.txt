    "3@xmath7 transition - metal ( tm ) oxides with the perovskite - type structure @xmath8o@xmath2 ( @xmath9 : rare earths , @xmath10 : alkaline earths , @xmath11 : tm ) exhibit a variety of physical properties .",
    "this is because complex interplays among the charge , spin and orbital degrees of freedom exist in these compounds , as often discussed .",
    "@xcite however , what are more important than the interplays themselves are subtle balances of them . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath8o@xmath2 oxides have a big advantage because the tertiary formula of their compounds ( @xmath12o@xmath2 and @xmath13o@xmath2 ) enables us to finely tune the balances , primarily the number of charge carriers , by controlling @xmath5 with minimal structural / environmental changes at the tm sites . in many 3@xmath7 tm perovskite - type oxides ,",
    "a family of manganese oxide @xmath14mno@xmath2 and their relatives occupies a special place because of its extraordinary property , the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr).@xcite this phenomenon is widely known as a manifestation of the complex interplays that are emphasizing a strong coupling between metallic conductivity and ferromagnetism , although it has not reached complete understanding yet .",
    "cmr is thus still attracting much attention and interest by a number of researchers .",
    "to seek the origin of cmr , particularly an aspect of the electrical conductivity , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) is one of the powerful tools because it directly probes the electrons coming out of the target sample.@xcite core - level xps is known as a typical element - selective technique and suitable for investigating the valence state of tm ions in the sample .",
    "however , the photoemission spectroscopy is generally surface sensitive and one should always pay appropriate attention when comparing the obtained spectra with macroscopic properties such as bulk electrical conductivity .",
    "bulk - sensitive hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( hx - pes)@xcite using synchrotron radiation was a breakthrough to overcome this difficulty and an increasing number of hx - pes studies have been reported in the past few years.@xcite among them , horiba _",
    "et al._@xcite found a new shoulder structure in the lower binding energy side of mn 2@xmath3 core - level hx - pes peak of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) thin films , which had never been observed until then because , according to their report , surface sensitivity in the conventional photoemission measurements is higher than hx - pes .",
    "more interestingly , this new structure changed its intensity with metal - insulator transition ( mit ) either by temperature or hole concentration @xmath5 , being interpreted as a well - screened peak due to electronic states at / near fermi energy ( @xmath15 ) . with regard to the temperature - dependent change , ueda _ et al .",
    "_ found a good agreement between the conductivity and the magnetization calculated using a hybridization term deduced from the core - level spectra of their la@xmath16ba@xmath17mno@xmath2 thin films.@xcite however , the origin of the new structure and its relation to electrical conductivity has not yet been clarified completely because ( 1 ) the insulating lamno@xmath2 ( lmo ) also has this structure as a hump and ( 2 ) no systematic investigations extending for the sr - rich region have been done so far .    in this paper , we re - examine the mn 2@xmath18 core - level photoemission spectra of sintered bulk lsmo by conventional xps to search how spectral features , including the above - mentioned shoulder structure , evolve with @xmath5 and how they can be correlated to electrical conductivity . from a detailed multiple - peak analysis",

    "[ mn2o3mno2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the mn 2@xmath3 peak width gradually increases probably due to the chemical shift of the mn 2@xmath3 peak from mn@xmath6 to mn@xmath4 , indicating that the mn@xmath4 component systematically grows with @xmath5 as expected .",
    "however , it actually increases even up to @xmath5=0.8 and then rapidly decreases in @xmath33 with significant changes in lineshape .",
    "hence , the mn valence may be changing more rapidly in @xmath33 than @xmath34 .",

    ", the background intensity due to secondary electrons were subtracted from the spectra using the shirley - type background correction@xcite and the spectra have been normalized with their areas from 635.0 to 648.5 ev .",
    "one can observe that the shoulder structure located at @xmath29639 ev already exists in @xmath5=0.0 , develops upto @xmath35 and then loses its weight for @xmath36 .",
    "this shoulder , characteristic of the lsmo system ( particularly in the metallic phase ) , has been considered to be measurable only by hx - pes.@xcite we note that the present result is the first decisive observation of the shoulder in the spectra from sintered bulk samples by the conventional lab xps , which is less bulk - sensitive than hx - pes .",
    "the intensity of the shoulder is , however , smaller than observed in hx - pes , probably due to less bulk sensitivity as already demonstrated.@xcite it is also noted that the shoulder weight is substantial even at the insulating @xmath5=0.0 and still finite upto @xmath5=0.8 ( discussed later ) , although insulating mn@xmath19o@xmath2 has no this weight ( see fig .",
    "[ mn2o3mno2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "interestingly , the shoulder was even observed in spectra from the surface fractured in air ( not shown ) .",
    "combining the fact that the o 1@xmath37 spectrum from the fractured surface in air has an extra surface - related peak , this may be indicating that the electronic state related to this shoulder has purely bulk nature and/or this electronic state at surface is very stable against oxidization .",
    "since the finite shoulder weight at @xmath5=0.0 may be caused by mobile carrier ( or mn@xmath4 ) due to off stoichiometry,@xcite we have checked stoichiometry of our lmo sample .",
    "several structural studies@xcite reported that the stoichiometric lmo is orthorhombic and should have the cell volume of 243@xmath30244 @xmath38 , which decreases with increasing @xmath39 of lamno@xmath40 or @xmath5 of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( up to @xmath41 ( ref .  ) ) .",
    "the cell volume of our lmo was 241.1 @xmath38 , which is more stoichiometric than lamno@xmath42 ( 5 % mn@xmath4 ) with its cell volume of 240.7 @xmath38 reported by ritter _",
    "et al_.@xcite hence , our lmo sample was practically stoichiometric although it may have a small amount of mn@xmath4 , less than about 4 % ( @xmath39=0.02 ) .",
    "in fact , theoretical calculations on eight mno@xmath43 clusters reproduced this shoulder in lmo , too.@xcite all these facts unambiguously demonstrate that the shoulder is not merely a consequence of doping - induced electronic states at @xmath15 as discussed by horiba _",
    "_ , who attributed the shoulder in a lmo thin film to excess oxygen.@xcite     spectra of ( a ) lmo compared with mn@xmath19o@xmath2 ( ref .  ) and ( b ) smo compared with mno@xmath19.@xcite , width=264 ]     spectrum of ( a ) la@xmath44sr@xmath45mno@xmath2 and ( b ) la@xmath45sr@xmath44mno@xmath2.,width=264 ]    in order to investigate the origin of the shoulder structure and extract more detailed information on the mn valence evolution , we performed multiple - peak fitting for the mn 2@xmath3 spectra in a different way from the literature , which has not been well - established so far but is accurate enough we believe to track the shoulder structure . in many reports",
    ", it is usually assumed that a spectrum of a certain @xmath5 can be reproduced by an appropriate superposition the mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath4 spectra.@xcite however , such a fitting wo nt be adequate here because the peak width and the shoulder intensity in particular do not evolve linearly with @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we adopt a mn@xmath19o@xmath2 ( ref .  ) and mno@xmath19 ( ref .  ) spectrum as references of the both ends of the mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath4 states , respectively ; figure  [ mn2o3mno2 ] ( a ) shows that the mn@xmath19o@xmath2 spectrum ( shifted by no more than 0.1 ev towards @xmath15 ) can explain the lmo spectrum well only except the shoulder.@xcite on the other hand , with a very tiny shift of 0.05ev towards @xmath15 , the mno@xmath19 spectrum almost completely agrees with the smo spectrum , as shown in fig .  [ mn2o3mno2 ] ( b).@xcite the mn@xmath19o@xmath2 and mno@xmath19 spectra are thus appropriate as the both ends in order to reproduce the spectra in all range of @xmath5 and track the intensity change at the shoulder . for the intermediate @xmath5 s",
    ", we further introduced an additional peak for the mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath4 main peaks , respectively , to simulate the spectral weight in the higher binding energy tail of the mn 2@xmath3 spectra .",
    "all the three peaks ( including the one for the shoulder named  lep \" , which stands for this low - binding energy peak ) were assumed to have the voigt profile for simplicity .",
    "the binding energies and the intensities of the end spectra ( mn@xmath19o@xmath2 and mno@xmath19 ones with tiny shifts ) were varied .",
    "thus , the fitting parameters were these and the magnitudes , widths , and the binding energies of the three functions . to reduce ambiguity of the fitting , we subtracted the background intensity due to secondary electrons from all the spectra using the shirley - type background correction.@xcite    , and their separation plotted as a function of sr concentration @xmath5 .",
    "( b ) relative spectral weight of the decomposed peaks deduced from the multiple - peak analysis .",
    "green triangles , blue circles , and red diamonds denote mn@xmath6 , mn@xmath4 , and lep , respectively .",
    "the green dashed line denotes the mn@xmath6 weight expected by @xmath5 , namely the la@xmath6/sr@xmath46 ratio ( not including the lep weight at @xmath5=0.0 ) .",
    "orange squares are deviation of the mn@xmath6 weight from this expected mn@xmath6/mn@xmath4 ratio .",

    "the open circles and dotted line show an expected behavior for an ideally bulk - sensitive measurement ( see text).,width=291 ]    figure  [ fitting ] shows decomposition of the ( a ) @xmath5=0.33 and ( b ) @xmath5=0.67 spectra as examples of the fitting .",
    "it is now obvious that the low - binding energy hump in the experimental spectrum is not just a continuation of the main peak but does originate in lep . in this way , we succeeded in tracking the weight of lep upto @xmath5=0.8 , beyond any literature , where it is too small to be noticed as a structure in the spectrum before decomposition .",
    "in fact , our experimental spectrum of @xmath5=0.8 is in good agreement with a recent report by bindu _",
    ", although their fitting did not include our lep as an independent peak.@xcite    the binding energy shifts of the mn 2@xmath3 components with @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( a ) .",
    "the mn@xmath6 main peak slightly moves towards @xmath15 with @xmath5 in agreement with literature@xcite , while lep moves in the same direction more rapidly until @xmath5=0.67 and then back away from @xmath15 . as a consequence , the separation between the mn@xmath6 main peak and lep increases with @xmath5 until @xmath5=0.67 , but",
    "eventually decrease .",
    "this trend agrees with what was observed in the thin films by horiba _",
    "_ although their data were limited up to @xmath5=0.55.@xcite in their mno@xmath43 cluster - model analysis , the separation was scaled by the hybridization term @xmath47 between the mn 3@xmath7 states and the doping - induced @xmath15 state , leading them to the conclusion that @xmath47 represents the magnitude of screening by conduction electrons ( we will denote this screening asconduction electron screening \" ( ces ) ) . however",
    ", this can not explain the fact that there is substantial spectral weight at the insulating lmo unless an amount of conduction electrons are assumed .",
    "although they attributed it to excess oxygen , it is somewhat questionable whether such large peak in both their thin - film and our bulk samples can satisfactorily be explained by this scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "van veenendaal s calculation using a mn@xmath48 cluster also reproduced a new peak corresponding to our lep , but he predicted the opposite behavior of the separation with @xmath5.@xcite in his framework , this peak represents nonlocal screening ( nls ) effects and does not necessarily correspond to the well - screened final state due to existence of coherent band at @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ]  ( b ) summarize the relative spectral weight of the decomposed peaks deduced from the multiple - peak analysis .",
    "it is found that the mn@xmath6 spectral weight does not linearly decrease with @xmath5 but is always higher than the expected mn@xmath6/mn@xmath4 ratio ; it is almost constant in @xmath49 , gradually decreases with further increase in @xmath5 until @xmath5=0.8 , and finally rapidly decreases to zero in @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mn@xmath4 spectral weight is almost constant in @xmath49 and rapidly increases after that in @xmath50 . even if we ignore weight of lep ( it is not very large ; see below ) , the above result is clearly demonstrating that the simple mn@xmath6/mn@xmath4 ratio assumption based on the la@xmath6/sr@xmath46 ratio is not appropriate . after discussing lep",
    ", we will be back to this issue later .",
    "the relative spectral weight of lep first increases from @xmath5=0.0 to 0.2 , slightly decreases until @xmath5=0.4 , and then goes down more rapidly towards @xmath5=1.0 .",
    "this change is , again , essentially the same as what was observed in thin films both at 300 k and 40 k as represented by the evolution of @xmath47 , having the maximum at @xmath5=0.2.@xcite hence , the ces scenario is not very compatible with the electrical conductivity change with @xmath5 , which is found in vast literature.@xcite we also show our data at 300 k in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( c ) .",
    "nevertheless , their temperature - dependent intensity changes in the peak at each @xmath5 does demonstrate the importance of ces .",
    "a simple nls scenario neither explains the spectral weight change with @xmath5 well since the calculated nls peak behavior , moving towards the main peak and rapidly losing its weight , is not what was observed in the experiments .",
    "however , his calculations also predicted that the a - type antiferromagnetism ( a - af ) coupled to the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion at @xmath5=0.0 substantially reduces the separation and the spectral weight.@xcite    a promising interpretation of our and past experiments / theories is that lep includes both nls and ces nature of mn@xmath6 sites ; at lmo ( @xmath5=0.0 ) , the a - af coupled to the jt distortion first suppresses the nls peak.@xcite the remnant of the a - af and the jt distortion upto @xmath5@xmath290.1 keeps suppressing the nls peak to some extent , but this suppression decreases with decreasing a - af and jt effects .",
    "in other words , the nls shoulder affected by the a - af and jt effects at @xmath5=0.0 continuously evolves to a larger nls peak in the ferromagnetic metallic phase at @xmath5=0.1@xmath290.2 , and then loses its weight simply due to decrease in @xmath51 electrons in @xmath52 .",
    "in this metallic range , however , ces nature develops in parallel , preventing from a rapid weight loss of the peak .",
    "finally , both nls and ces weight disappear with decrease in @xmath51 electrons .",
    "the change of the separation from the main peak with @xmath5 can also be understood by the same idea ; with decreasing a - af and jt effects with @xmath5 , the separation becomes large.@xcite in the range of @xmath52 , increasing ces nature takes over the origin of the increase in the separation.@xcite finally , the separation turns to decrease a little in the largest @xmath5 s because of dominant nls nature.@xcite here we note that the nls and ces can not be distinguished in the metallic phase .    based on the above interpretation",
    ", we may expect that the spectral weight of lep behaves as the electrical conductivity with @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( c ) shows sr - doping dependence of electrical conductivity at 300 k. it increases with @xmath5 in the range of @xmath53 , taking the maximum at @xmath35 , gradually decreases in @xmath54 , and a rapid drop follows in @xmath34 .",
    "however , this behavior does not agree with that of lep described earlier .",
    "in particular , the conductivity of lmo ( @xmath5=0.0 ) is lower than @xmath5=0.8 while the lep weight at @xmath5=0.0 is much larger than at @xmath5=0.8 .",
    "hence , the spectral weight of lep alone is not actually representing electrical conductivity .",
    "the area below ( above ) the red ( blue ) curve denotes the mn@xmath6 ( mn@xmath4 ) main peak .",
    "the well - screened peak intensity due to nls and/or ces is in between .",
    "note that this figure does not include the temperature - dependent changes.,width=302 ]    why does not the intensity variation of the well - screened peak due to nls / ces represent the electrical conductivity ?",
    "we believe that this question is closely related to the deviation of the mn@xmath6 weight from the expected value ; both nls@xcite and ces@xcite calculations were limited to mn@xmath6 sites , ignoring these effects at mn@xmath4 sites .",
    "however , there should be such well - screened peak for the mn@xmath4 configuration , too and it should be located at a lower binding energy side of the mn@xmath4 main peak .",
    "hence the mn@xmath4 nls / ces peak would be overlapping with the mn@xmath6 main peak and this is the reason why the apparent mn@xmath6 weight is larger than expected , namely the observed deviation of the mn@xmath6 weight probably represents the mn@xmath4 nls / ces weight .",
    "the sum of weight of lep and the deviation ( orange squares in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( b ) ) is compared with the electrical conductivity in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( c ) .",
    "the overall trend of the weight sum has fair agreement with that of the electrical conductivity . from @xmath5=0.0 to 0.2 , the weight sum increases with @xmath5 in agreement with the conductivity.@xcite it even reproduces the smaller conductivity of @xmath55 than @xmath56 in spite of the larger lep weight in the former range .",
    "the conductivity has a peak at @xmath5=0.4 and a large drop from @xmath5=0.4 to 0.5 in agreement with other reports,@xcite which may be reflecting of a structural phase transition here.@xcite however , the weight sum fails to reproduce the peak and the drop from @xmath5=0.4 to 0.5 in the conductivity .",
    "this is probably because the lab - xps measurement is more surface sensitive than hx - pes and the bulk - sensitive ces weight@xcite is underestimated in the metallic range of @xmath5 due to reduced ferromagnetism at surface.@xcite in other words , if the spectra were ideally bulk - sensitive , the weight sum of the @xmath5=0.33 and 0.4 ( which are the most metallic samples ) would be larger than observed and the weight sum behavior will be more similar to the electric conductivity , namely , the weight sum qualitatively reproduces the peak and the drop and even the plateau of the conductivity around @xmath56 as well .    a schematic relative spectral weight of each component in mn @xmath57 core - level peak deduced from the present results",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ mn2pschematic ] .",
    "the total nls / ces weight comes from both mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath4 sites and the nls nature is dominant in the well - screened spectral weight near the both insulating ends , while the ces nature becomes dominant in the metallic phase .",
    "however , we note that even nls will not be observed if the system is very insulating , implying that nls in the insulating phase still manifests the electrical conductivity to some extent . as a result , the total nls / ces weight is found to be a rough measure of electrical conductivity of the system .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the core - level electronic structure of la@xmath0sr@xmath58mno@xmath2 by xps . employing a careful sample synthesis , we have , for the first time by the conventional xps , succeeded in observing a clear well - screened structure at the lower binding energy side of the mn 2@xmath3 core - level spectra , which had been observed only by hx - pes so far . by the multiple - peak analysis on the mn 2@xmath3",
    ", we identified the well - screened peak in a wide range of @xmath59 and established its intensity / location changes with @xmath5 , which were not consistent with a simple metallic screening .",
    "the multiple - peak analysis also revealed that the mn@xmath4 spectral weight was not proportional to the nominal hole concentration @xmath5 but substantially less than expected .",

    "<S> considerable weight of the shoulder at @xmath5=0.0 and the fact that the shoulder weight was even slightly going down from @xmath5=0.2 to 0.4 were not compatible with the idea that this weight simply represents the metallic behavior . further analysis found that the whole mn 2@xmath3 peak can be decomposed into four portions , the mn@xmath4 , the ( nominal ) mn@xmath6 , the shoulder , and the other spectral weight located almost at the mn@xmath6 location . </S>",
    "<S> we concluded that this weight represents the well - screened final state at mn@xmath4 sites , whereas the shoulder is known as that of the mn@xmath6 states . </S>",
