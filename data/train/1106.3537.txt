    "we discuss a few practical issues related to the implementation of our purification scheme in section iii , while a short summary and outlook are given in section iv .",
    "the main physical resources of our purification scheme are : ( i ) chains of atoms , ( ii ) high - finesse optical cavities , and ( iii ) two types of detectors for the destructive and non - destructive measurement of atomic states . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we show a scheme of the proposed quantum repeater segment including two neighboring nodes ( a and b ) and combining entanglement purification and distribution protocols in a single experimental setup . in this setup ,",
    "each repeater node consists of one optical cavity @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) acting along the @xmath27-axis , a laser beam @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , a chain of atoms transported by means of an optical lattice along the along the @xmath30-axis , one stationary atom trapped inside the cavity with the help of a vertical lattice , laser beams @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) which act along the @xmath27-axis , a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , a detector @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) connected to the neighboring node through a classical communication channel , and a ccd camera .",
    "first we shall connect the purification scheme introduced in the previous section with the experimental setup from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) to clarify the role of each element .",
    "obviously , the sequence of steps in fig .  [ fig1 ] with an elementary block displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] can not be directly applied to our experimental setup since it would require one individual cavity for each elementary block and , therefore , an unreasonable demand of physical resources .",
    "instead , we shall consider a modified sequence that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which perfectly fits into our proposed experimental setup . by this sequence , repeater nodes a and b share only one elementary block in which the qubit pair @xmath37 is a permanent pair and the other two pairs are introduced in the block temporarily in a successive fashion .",
    "initially , there is only one permanent pair in the block that is characterized by the fidelity @xmath38 and supplemented by two extra temporary pairs @xmath15 and @xmath39 , both characterized by the fidelity @xmath40 . using these three qubit pairs , the sequence displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can now be applied and in the case of successful purification , the increased fidelity @xmath41 of pair @xmath37 , with @xmath42 , is obtained . after the projected pairs @xmath15 and @xmath39 are replaced with two fresh entangled pairs @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the purification steps are repeated .    while the permanent qubit pair encodes the distilled entangled qubit pair and stores it for the subsequent purification rounds , temporary qubit pairs are used to increase gradually the fidelity of the permanent pair .",
    "below we shall associate permanent qubits with stationary atoms trapped inside cavities @xmath25 and @xmath26 and temporary qubits with atoms in the chain , inserted into the horizontal lattices and transported along the @xmath30-axis [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "according to our experimental setup , this identification implies that atoms pass sequentially through the cavity and only two atoms from the chain can couple simultaneously to the same cavity mode .",
    "these two atoms together with the stationary ( trapped ) atom , therefore , provide an atomic triplet in each repeater node as required for our purification scheme .",
    "right before each atom from node a enters the cavity , it becomes entangled with the respective atom from node b as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) by wavy lines , such that each entangled pair is described by eqs .",
    "( [ w - state])-([f - def ] ) .",
    "this entanglement is generated ( non - locally ) by means of an entanglement distribution block , indicated in fig .  [ fig3](a ) by a rectangle .",
    "this entanglement distribution may be realized in various ways @xcite , where our purification protocol here does not depend on any specific choice for the entanglement distribution . during the transition of an atomic pair through the cavity , the triplet of atoms undergoes a cavity - mediated ( heisenberg xy ) evolution in each of the repeater nodes , which shall be referred to below as the ( new ) purification gate .",
    "according to the sequence in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , furthermore , the purification sequence is completed once the states of a ( conveyed ) atomic pair are measured and the outcome of projections is pairwise exchanged between the repeater nodes in order to decide if the purification was successful or not .    in our experimental scheme ,",
    "the latter projections are performed by means of a laser beam @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and a ccd camera in each of the repeater nodes as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "while the laser beam @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) removes atoms in a given quantum state from the chain without affecting atoms in the other state ( so - called push - out technique @xcite ) , the ccd camera is used to detect the presence of remaining atoms via fluorescence imaging and determine , therefore , the state of each atom that leaves the cavity .",
    "apparently , such measurements of atomic states are destructive and , being performed outside the cavity , detected atoms can not interact anymore with the stationary atom .",
    "assuming that the purification was successful , the next atomic pair from the chain enters the cavity ( in each repeater node ) and the next purification round occurs with the same stationary atom ( permanent qubit ) .    in the unsuccessful case , however , the stationary atoms should be re - initialized and the entire sequence from fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] should be re - started which , in turn , demands a high amount of atomic pairs in the chain and requires unreasonable operational times of the entire purification protocol . in order to avoid these potential bottlenecks and perform entanglement purification in a resource- and time - efficient way",
    ", we exploit : ( i ) periodicity of cavity - mediated evolution and ( ii ) both destructive and non - destructive state measurements of atoms in the chain . these features and detection techniques",
    "enable us to restore the initial fidelity of the permanent qubit pair in the case of an unsuccessful purification event .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "we set velocity of the atomic chain such that the transition time of atoms through the cavity is higher than the operational time required for one single purification gate .",
    "after an atomic pair enters the cavity and undergoes ( together with the stationary atom ) one purification gate , the atomic pair is still located inside the cavity .",
    "now instead of destructive measurements of atomic states outside the cavity as above , we probe atomic states inside the cavity by means of non - destructive state measurements which are based on cavity transmission techniques ( see below ) . by exchanging the outcome of these measurements between both repeater nodes , the state of the atomic triplet",
    "can be restored to its initial product state in the case of an unsuccessful purification event .",
    "the restoration is realized by switching on the cavity - mediated ( heisenberg xy ) evolution once more after the purification gate and non - destructive measurements .",
    "the duration of this evolution , moreover , is adjusted such that the quantum state of the atomic triplet completes one period of evolution and returns to its initial state , i.e. , the state of the atomic triplet before the interaction of the stationary atom with the conveyed atomic pair .",
    "this auxiliary evolution restores the initial state of stationary atoms in each of the repeater nodes and , as a consequence , the entanglement fidelity that has been obtained in the previous ( successful ) purification round . with help of such state non - destructive measurements and one conditional cavity - mediated evolution ,",
    "therefore , the entanglement fidelity of stationary atoms either increases due to successful purification or remains unchanged due to unsuccessful purification .    in our experimental setup ,",
    "the cavity - mediated evolution of atoms is controlled by using short resonant pulses produced by laser beams @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the repeater nodes a and b , respectively .",
    "these pulses transfer the electronic population of atoms from an auxiliary atomic state to the excited ( or backwards ) such that the atoms couple to ( or decouple from ) the cavity field in a controlled fashion .",
    "non - destructive measurements of atomic states , furthermore , are performed with help of a ( probe ) laser beam @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , which is tuned to the cavity resonant frequency , and detector @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) that monitors the transmission of this probe laser .",
    "the idea of state non - destructive measurements is based on the suppression of cavity transmission that arises due to the strong atom - cavity coupling ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and which , in turn , enables various state non - destructive detection schemes which we are going to discuss briefly in sect .",
    "[ sec - rpp ] .",
    "regardless of the outcome of non - destructive measurements , each atomic pair is detected by means of a laser beam @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and a ccd camera once it leaves the cavity .",
    "this ( state - destructive ) projection is essential to complete the purification protocol in the case of successful distillation , but also to discard inconclusive outcomes of non - destructive measurements .",
    "we recall that each repeater node disposes @xmath45 atomic pairs inserted into an optical lattice such that atoms within one pair are separated by a distance @xmath46 and the distance between two neighboring pairs is adjusted such that only one atomic pair can be coupled simultaneously to the same cavity mode [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "the entire chain is conveyed with a constant velocity @xmath47 along the @xmath30-axis such that their position vectors @xmath48(t ) = @xmath49 cross the cavity at the anti - node ( @xmath50 ) and where @xmath51 denotes the initial position of the @xmath52-th atom outside the cavity .",
    "both velocity @xmath47 and inter - atomic distance @xmath46 can be controlled experimentally by adjusting the shift in the frequencies of the two counter - propagating laser beams and by selecting a proper wavelength of the optical lattice , respectively @xcite .",
    "apart from @xmath45 atomic pairs , moreover , each repeater node contains one stationary atom trapped inside the cavity by a lattice acting along the @xmath27-axis . as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the position vector @xmath53 = @xmath54 of this atom crosses the cavity at the anti - node ( @xmath55 ) and is located in the same @xmath56 plane as the atomic chain .",

    "we recall , furthermore , that the purification gate from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is based on the heisenberg xy interaction that is produced deterministically by coupling two - level atoms to the same mode of a high - finesse resonator in our scheme . due to the encoding scheme from fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , however , the detuned optical cavity is coupled to the atomic transition @xmath60 , while the atomic qubit is stored by means of states @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in order to couple the atomic qubit to the cavity ,",
    "therefore , an intermediate excitation coupled to the @xmath61 transition is further required in order to transfer coherently the electronic population of atoms from the qubit - storage states @xmath12 to the cavity - active states @xmath62 . for this reason ,",
    "the laser beam @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is introduced in our experimental setup and coupled resonantly to the @xmath61 transition .    right after the atomic pair is loaded into the cavity ,",
    "this laser beam is switched on for a short time period that is equivalent to a @xmath63 rabi pulse . under the action of this pulse , the laser field couples simultaneously to the atomic triplet ( atomic pair from the chain and stationary atom ) and transfers coherently the electronic population of each atom from the qubit - storage to cavity - active states .",
    "this coherent transfer , in turn , couples the atomic triplet to the cavity and activates the cavity - mediated evolution within this atomic triplet . in the same fashion ,",
    "one additional laser pulse applied after the operational time that is required for the purification gate , transfers coherently the atomic population from the cavity - active to qubit - storage states backwards and stops the cavity - mediated evolution . by switching appropriately on and off the laser beam @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , therefore",
    ", we can precisely control the duration of the cavity - mediated evolution once the atomic pair is conveyed into the the cavity .    before we turn to the hamiltonian that governs the evolution of atoms coupled to the same cavity mode",
    ", it is important to explain the mechanism of cavity - mediated evolution of an atomic triplet .",
    "let us consider , for instance , three atoms prepared initially in the product state : @xmath64 , where the subscripts @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the atomic pair from the chain with position vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , while the subscript @xmath69 corresponds to the stationary atom with position vector @xmath70 . in this case , composite atomic states evolve according to the sequences : @xmath71 if there were initially no photons in the cavity .    the middle part of the above sequence describes the cavity - mediated interaction between the atoms realized by means of a single - photon exchange .",
    "in order to avoid the ( fast decaying ) cavity - excited state @xmath72 and ensure that the cavity remains ( almost ) unpopulated during the entire evolution , we require a rather large detuning between the atomic @xmath73 transition and the resonant frequency of the cavity field @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the resonant frequency of the cavity field and @xmath76\\ ] ] is the ( position - dependent ) atom - cavity coupling .- coordinate by means of width of gaussian beam , radius of curvature , and guoy phase @xcite . to a good approximation , however , we can neglect this dependence if the distance between two cavity anti - nodes ( to which atomic pair and stationary atom are coupled ) is relatively small .",

    "the latter situation with two atoms coupled to the same cavity mode and ( probe ) laser field , however , might introduce an undesirable interaction between the atoms . in practice , this technique is merely limited by the rate of inelastic raman scattering induced by the probe laser , causing random @xmath214 jumps . apart from this major limitation , moreover , the motion of atoms due to the conveyor belt and atomic thermal motion lead together to a weaker atom - cavity coupling and , therefore , to a notable degradation of the total detection efficiency .    an alternative ( non - destructive ) detection scheme , based on cavity transmission and fitting nicely our experimental setup , has been proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
