    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) appear to be a subclass of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "they have similar durations to the long - soft grbs , but they have a low gamma - ray flux , a high ratio of x - ray to gamma - ray flux , and a spectral peak at a much lower energy ( kippen _ et al . _  2003 ) .",
    "first identified by the wide field cameras on bepposax ( heise _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) they have been located with increasing frequency by _",
    "hete-2_. followup observations have in some cases successfully found afterglow emission , most commonly at x - ray wavelengths , and occasionally in the optical and nir .",
    "accurate positions have indicated that , like grbs , xrfs are found in star - forming galaxies at cosmological distances ( e.g. bloom _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) , but , based on statistics of a few , at rather lower median redshift than grbs .",
    "recently the very low - redshift xrf 060218 , 145 mpc distant , was shown to be associated with sn 2006aj ( campana _ et al . _  2006",
    "; pian _ et al . _  2006",
    "; modjaz _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) , clearly demonstrating that some xrfs , as for long duration grbs originate in the core collapse of a massive star in a type ic supernova ( hjorth et al . 2003",
    "; stanek et al . 2003 ) .",
    "photometric evidence for associated supernovae has also been seen in a number of xrfs previously ( e.g. fynbo _ et al .",
    "_  2004 ; soderberg _ et al . _",
    "2004;2005 ; bersier _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) , however the absence of sn signatures in some cases indicate that the sn emission may be markedly fainter than the prototypical grb supernova sn  1998bw ( levan _ et al . _  2005",
    "; soderberg _ et al . _",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the existence of xrfs shows that the range of spectral properties associated with grbs is very large .",
    "the peak of the @xmath2 spectrum ( @xmath3 ) can be seen from @xmath45 kev to @xmath5 mev .",
    "an important question is , therefore : what physical processes are responsible for this range of energies",
    "? observations of the prompt and afterglow emission of xrfs can be used to probe this question and place constraints on the energy generation and physical structure within these highly energetic explosions .",
    "various scenarios have been proposed to explain the lower peak energy of xrfs compared to grbs ; these can be split into several subsets of model , of which the most broadly discussed are : ( i ) grbs at very high redshifts would have their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) shifted into the x - ray window ( heise _ et al . _",
    "2001 ) ; ( ii ) grbs whose lorentz factor is modified due to the effects of baryon loading within the jet . in external shock models",
    "high baryon loading ( the so - called dirty fireball ) can create an xrf ( dermer _ et al . _  1999",
    "; ramirez - ruiz & lloyd - roming 2002 ; huang _ et al . _",
    "2002 ) , while in contrast for internal shock models very clean jets produce large x - ray fluxes ( zhang & meszaros 2002 , barraud _ et al . _",
    "( iii ) grbs with either a differing geometry or observer viewing angle can also naturally create xrfs , for example due to broader than normal jets ( huaag _ et al . _  2004",
    "; zhang _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) ; bursts where the line of sight is `` off - axis '' with respect to the jet orientation or bursts whose jet is structured , either in a simple ( two component ) manner , or with more complex variations with viewing angle .",
    "( iv ) finally it is possible that xrfs represent manifestations of differing physical processes to grbs themselves , perhaps originating from a hot photosphere ( meszaros _ et al . _",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the discovery of a correlation between @xmath3 and the square root of the isotropic energy release ( @xmath6 ) ( amati _ et al . _",
    "2002 ) directly implies that softer bursts have lower energies and can be well explained by models where the xrf is the result of a viewing angle effect . in other words ,",
    "xrfs are seen when a classical grb is viewed off the primary collimation so the highest energy emission is not seen ( e.g. yamazaki _ et al . _  2002 ; rhoads 2003 ; dado _ et al . _",
    "however , outliers to this relation can be found ( e.g. sazonov et al . 2004 ) , and it remains to be confirmed that it is purely the result of a viewing angle effect .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite was launched in november 2004 and is now delivering localizations for approximately 2 grbs per week ( see gehrels _ et al . _  ( 2004 ) for a description of the _ swift _ mission ) .",
    "the passband of the grb detectors on _ swift _ is smaller than that on _ hete-2 _ , with a low energy response down to 15 kev compared with 5 kev for _ hete-2_. xrf  050215b was the first xrf to be detected by _",
    "swift _ and to have moderately rapid x - ray followup ( previous xrfs have not been observed in x - rays for at least several hours , and more typically days ) .",
    "here we report the results of optical / ir and x - ray observations of xrf  050215 and the constraints they place on models for the production of xrfs .",
    "xrf  050215b was detected by the _",
    "swift _ burst alert telescope at 02:33:12 ut on 15th february 2005 ; the initial location was ra = 11:37:48 , dec = 40:48:18 with a 90% error radius of 4 arcminutes ( trigger 106106 , barthelmy _ et al . _",
    "_ swift _ slewed to the burst promptly , but was unable to observe until @xmath7 29 minutes after the trigger because it was in the high radiation environment of the south atlantic anomaly .",

    "the ratio of fluxes in the 2 - 30 and 30 - 400 kev bands was 1.65 , implying significantly more x - ray emission than @xmath9-ray and indicating that 050215b was indeed an xrf .",
    "initial ground - based observations failed to yield an optical counterpart .",

    "the photometric calibration of the r - band images was done using the photometry from the sloan digital sky survey , which covers the region of the burst in the same filter as used for the gmos observations .",
    "photometry of xrf  050215b is shown in table [ phot ] and the k - band light curve is shown in figure [ klc ] .",
    "the afterglow was very faint , and therefore the signal to noise was typically low ( @xmath30 in most observations ) .",

    "one possibility is that our measured fluxes do not contain pure afterglow but some contribution from an underlying host galaxy . in this case",
    "the true decay slope may be faster .",
    "we can estimate the maximum possible contribution from an underlying host by making the assumption that the host galaxy contributes a flux equal to the upper limit of the final epoch observation ( i.e. lies just below the detection threshold ) . given the r magnitude of the host ( see below ) and the typical r - k colours of grb host galaxies ( in the range 2.5 - 3 , le floch _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) it is unlikely that the host is significantly fainter than this , and therefore this may provide an acceptable estimate of the afterglow decay .",
    "the ( putative host ) subtracted photometry is shown in red in figure [ klc ] .",
    "this photometry , while very uncertain , is marginally consistent with a single power - law decay of index @xmath34 ; thus , within the uncertainty ( due to the unknown host magnitude ) , the optical and x - ray slopes are consistent with being identical .",
    "psf matched image subtractions of the optical observations taken 11 , 21 and 115 days after the burst reveal no evidence for any variation , demonstrating that the optical light from xrf  050215b was dominated by the host galaxy from 11 days onwards , and did not contain a significant contribution from either afterglow or associated supernova ( the limit on any transient emission at the location of the afterglow is r@xmath725.8 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this host galaxy is r=24.7 , comparable to the median of grb host galaxies seen to date .",
    "our final k - band point can also be used to place a limit on the host colour .",
    "assuming it has k@xmath022.25 this implies that r - k@xmath4 2.5 .",
    "this is again comparable to the r - k colours of grb hosts which have a mean r - k=3 ( chary _ et al . _  2002",
    "; le floch _ et al . _",
    "2003 ) .    under the assumption that a supernova was associated with xrf 050215b , we can use the observed limits on the supernova emission to crudely estimate a lower bound to the redshift ( also assuming that there is no excess extinction along the line of sight to xrf 050215b ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude of any supernova of r=25.8 is comparable to the peak magnitude of a supernova such as sn  1998bw at @xmath35 .",
    "however more typical type ic supernova such as those putatively associated with xrfs ( e.g. fynbo _ et al . _  2004",
    "; bersier _ et al . _",
    "2005 ) span a range of magnitudes from similar to sn  1998bw to a factor of 10 fainter , these fainter supernovae would only be visible to moderate @xmath36 redshift .        .",
    "the extrapolation of the xrt observations to early times falls slightly below the prompt emission measured by the bat ( and the fitting of a single power - law to both bat and xrt data does not result in a statistically acceptable fit , although given the calibration uncertainties it may be consistent with a single decline from @xmath37 hours onward ) .",

    "all of these models can efficiently soften the prompt emission from that seen in `` classical '' grbs . although the prompt emission of bursts from these different mechanisms may be largely indistinguishable ,",
    "it is possible that their afterglows will show significant variation in their appearance ( e.g. granot _ et al . _  2005 ) .",
    "we consider these models , and how they may apply to the afterglow of xrf  050215b , below .    in the off - axis model , the highest energy emission ( i.e. @xmath9-rays )",
    "is confined within a narrow cone oriented slightly away from the observer and is not seen .",

    "et al._(2005 ) consider the afterglows produced by such a model .",
    "the early afterglow of a uniform jet with sharp edges can be seen to rise at early times as the more energetic material becomes visible ; it then reaches a peak at a time roughly corresponding to the jet break , and from that point , follows a decay which is indistinguishable from an on - axis grb ( since all of the ejecta are visible ) , thus the late time decay slope would be expected to be rapid @xmath51 .",

    "thus the early observations of xrf  050215b can be explained under this model . however , the late time slope should be steep ( @xmath52 ) while a shallow slope is observed to 10 days post burst . thus indicating that the jet must be moderately wide , although other grbs ( e.g. grb 970508 ) have been shown to behave as a single power - law out to large times ( see e.g. bloom , kulkarni & frail 2003 ) .    under the dirty fireball model",

    "the decay of the afterglow is much slower ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 depending of the location of the cooling break ( rhoads 2003 ) ) .",
    "thus , for a typical @xmath55 burst the predicted decay slope would be @xmath56 , broadly consistent with the observed temporal slopes .",
    "however , dirty fireballs can only create a low peak energy if the prompt emission is created by external rather than internal shocks .",
    "recent observations favour a scenario in which the bursts themselves are caused by internal shocks ( zhang et al .",
    "furthermore the shape of the lightcurve , and comparison of the xrt and bat lightcurves place constraints . in the dirty fireball model ,",
    "the deceleration occurs when the outflow has collected 1/@xmath57 of rest mass ; for lower values of @xmath57 ( i.e. xrfs ) this deceleration time is significantly longer ( scaling as @xmath58 ) .",
    "the xrt observations can not be used to constrain the deceleration time since they begin @xmath7 30 minutes after the burst .",
    "however the shape of the bat lightcurve implies that deceleration must have occurred at early times , and thus that the @xmath57 can not have been very low .",
    "observations of future xrfs in x - rays in the seconds to minutes after the burst will allow stronger constraints to be made .    alternatively , under the internal shock model a clean fireball can naturally accommodate the creation of an xrf ( zhang & meszaros 2002 ) , especially if the contrast in lorentz factor between shells is small , which leads to inefficient energy dissipation ( e.g. barraud _ et al . _  2004 ) . in this case , the decay index of @xmath59 can also naturally be accommodated , although only if it is observed prior to the jet - break .",
    "a final possibility is that the xrf is caused by the opening angle of the jet itself .",
    "broad jets in grbs may be present either alone ( e.g. lamb , donaghy & graziani , 2005 ) or as a multicomponent structure including narrower ( @xmath9-ray emitting ) jets ( e.g. berger et al .",
    "2003 ; huang et al .",
    "2004 ) , although such models have recently been shown not to fit the afterglow of grb 030329 , which they were posited to explain ( granot 2005 ) .",
    "these broader jets have correspondingly later jet break times than the narrow emission responsible for the grb , and would naturally explain the lack of a jet break for @xmath010 days after the burst .",
    "indeed , regardless of the precise mechanism for the generation of this xrf , the lack of jet break implies that the jet opening angle must be wide , perhaps making a broader jet the most likely explanation .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the properties of both the prompt and x - ray emission of xrf  050215b with those of the population of bursts detected by _",
    "swift_. although the _ hete-2 _",
    "observations allowed for this burst to be classified as an xrf , the behaviour as observed by the bat was not significantly different from that seen in many other bursts .",
    "indeed the measured photon index of 2.0 is comparable to the mean of _ swift _ bursts in general ( e.g. obrien _ et al . _  2006",
    ") , although it does lie amongst the softer bursts detected by batse ( as do many _ swift _ grbs ) .",
    "thus , it may be that _",
    "swift _ , as for _ hete-2 _ and _ bepposax _ , does detect a large population of xrfs .",
    "however , swift is unable to accurately constrain their spectral properties due to its limited bandpass in comparison to previous missions . indeed in the case of xrf 050406 the apparent peak energy @xmath60kev ( romano et al . 2005 ) and thus",
    "although it was possible to identify the burst as an xrf its peak energy and detailed spectral prompt spectral properties could not be accurately measured .",
    "only xrf 050416 has a measured @xmath3 from _ swift _ , with @xmath61 kev ( sakamoto et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , even in this case the measurement is relatively weak , since a simple power - law fit yields a @xmath62 .",
    "the afterglow of the burst is both fainter than typical ( even for _ swift _ bursts ) and also more slowly declining , with no evidence for a jet break during long observations lasting for 10 days since the burst .",
    "the afterglow is very faint in the k - band ( fainter than the majority of upper limits on k - band afterglow brightness ) and lies at the faint end of the flux distribution for long duration grb detected by _",
    "swift_. there are a number of comparably faint bursts e.g. grb 050223 - page _ et al . _  2005",
    "; grb / xrf 050406 - romano et al .",
    "2005 ; grb 050421 - godet _ et al . _",
    "2006 , grb 050911 - page _ et al . _",
    "it is interesting to note that the proposed explanations for this faintness vary widely , demonstrating the large range of physical processes which affect the brightness of a given afterglow .",
    "for example grb 050911 was interpreted as being due to a bh - ns merger , since its lack of an x - ray afterglow was reminiscent of short duration grbs ( e.g. gehrels et al . 2005 ) , while its lightcurve could also be interpreted as being due to several accretion event which are seen in bh - ns mergers ( davies , levan & king 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast grb 050421 was explained as being due to a `` naked '' grb - a burst occurring in a region of very low density , which thus affected the brightness of the afterglow ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "2000 ) . for xrfs ,",
    "such explanations are not normally considered and the most commonly discussed explanations involve differing geometries of either the jet itself or the observer orientation .",
    "for example the flat slopes of the afterglow lightcurves are predicted in various off - axis models .",
    "however , for `` normal '' long duration bursts a generic feature of the afterglow light curve is a flat phase in the afterglow ( e.g. nousek et al .",
    "this is normally interpreted as being due to late time energy injection from the central engine , and is also interpreted as such in the afterglow of xrf 050406 ( romano et al . 2005 ) , which has a very flat light curve out to late times @xmath63 . while this flat phase is obviously a generic feature of x - ray afterglows it is less apparent in the optical and ir .",
    "thus for xrf 050215b , where the x - ray and optical decays are similar it is more likely that the relatively slow decay is simply a result of the jet structure .",
    "it is also interesting to note that other optical afterglows of xrfs have shown similar behaviour to xrf 050406 in the optical regime .",
    "for example xrf 020903 showed flaring behaviour and a flat decay in the r - band ( bersier et al .",
    "2006 ) , behaviour which has not commonly been seen in grb afterglows ( although the sample of xrf optical / ir afterglows remains much smaller ) .",
    "one of the most important contributions that _ swift _ has made to the grb field comes from the decrease in time between the burst itself and the first pointed observations .",
    "although in the pre-_swift _ era a few bursts were observed promptly in the optical ( e.g. grb 990123 , akerlof et al .",
    "1999 ) these were rare , and prompt , pointed , x - ray observations were never made .",
    "it was thus hoped that the early afterglow emission would provide crucial tests of various afterglow models . in practice ,",
    "the behaviour seen is somewhat different from what was expected ( e.g. tagliaferri et al . 2005 ; nousek et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the presence of frequent x - ray flares ( e.g. burrows et al . 2005 ) makes the x - ray afterglows a less `` clean '' probe than may have been hoped for .",
    "nonetheless , this early phase can provide powerful diagnostics of various models .",
    "obrien et al . (",
    "2006 ) have studied this transition period for a number of grbs and show that generally the extrapolation of the x - ray afterglow to early times `` joins '' with the prompt emission and does not exhibit a strong discontinuity .",
    "this behaviour , when seen in xrfs , disfavours a sharp - edged jet if jet geometry is the dominating factor .",
    "however , for three well studied _",
    "swift _ x - ray afterglows ( xrf 050215b , xrf 050406 and xrf 050416 ) there is apparently no jet break seen out to late times ( @xmath0 10 days in each case ) .",
    "thus , all of these cases must have wide opening angles .",
    "ultimately , insight into the xrf phenomena is likely to be made via the subset of bursts which are detected simultaneously by bat and another satellite ( e.g. hete-2 , suzaku - wam , konus ) and where early x - ray and optical observations can be paired with well constrained spectral parameters for the prompt emission .",
    "we have presented observations of xrf  050215b .",
    "this was the first x - ray flash to be located by _",
    "swift _ and was achieved by the use of _ hete-2 _ and _ swift _ in synergy , utilising the sensitivity and wide field of view of the _ swift - bat _ and the wide spectral range of _ hete - fregate_. the fluence within the prompt emission was comparable to that seen in previous xrfs , although the x - ray lightcurve is fainter than the majority of _ swift _ bursts , while in the infrared xrf  050215b is the faintest afterglow ever to have been detected ( although some bursts have been invisible to comparable limits ) . indeed , xrf  050215b had a flux at 9 hours which was only just observable with a 4 m telescope , and at early times was invisible to any robotic or uvot observations . as also suggested by berger _",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) , this implies that locating the afterglows of some grbs in the _ swift _ era will require rapid response observations from larger telescopes since many bursts will be too faint to be detected by the uvot or even by larger aperture robotic ground based telescopes .    the limited volume of data and lack of redshift available for this burst make it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the cause of the soft @xmath9-ray spectrum ;",
    "however the lack of any observed jet - break to @xmath0 10 days post burst make a broad jet the most likely explanation .",
    "the late - time behaviour of xrf 050215b is qualitatively somewhat similar to the late - time x - ray lightcurve of the recent grb 060218 , which , by virtue of its proximity ( 145 mpc ) had a bright x - ray and optical afterglow .",
    "in particular , grb 060218 also had a long - lasting slow decay , as seen in xrf  050215b , although the relative faintness of both afterglow and host galaxy , coupled with the lack of any supernova emission , imply a much higher redshift in the latter case .",
    "furthermore grb 060218 had an exceptionally long duration in @xmath9-rays ( @xmath64s ) , making the status of grb 060218 relative to the bulk of the xrf population unclear , and pointing to the continuing need for further well - observed xrfs if we are to understand the diversity in their emission mechanisms and their relationship to grbs ."
