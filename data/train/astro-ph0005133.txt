    "it has been recently established that nls1s are characterized by extreme soft excesses and extreme variability @xcite , although the origin still remain a puzzle .",
    "since these features are quite reminiscent of those of galactic black hole candidates during the very high state , i.e.  the state in which the luminosity is comparable to the eddington luminosity , @xmath4 , it is natural to assume that nls1s have a systematically large disk luminosity , @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , the disk is known to become a slim disk @xcite . what , then , is the observational signature of the slim disk ?",
    "it will be useful to quickly review disk theory .",
    "the standard disk model was constructed using energy balance between viscous heating and radiative cooling with advective energy transport assumed negligible . hence , accretion energy can be efficiently converted to radiation energy .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the advection - dominated flow , in which viscous heating is balanced by advective cooling ; that is , accretion energy is stored in the accreting gas or trapped photons within the flow and is finally swallowed by the black hole .",
    "the slim disk corresponds to the optically thick , advection - dominated flow .",
    "the slim disk exhibits rather unique temperature profiles .",
    "we calculate the disk structure , taking into account the advection , and plot in figure 1 the effective temperature distribution ( upper ) and spectra ( lower ) , together with those of standard disks ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "when the mass - flow rate is relatively small , @xmath6 , the disk resides in the standard - disk regime .",
    "when it increases up to @xmath7 , the two disk models give distinctly different results .",
    "first , the slim disk exhibits a flatter temperature profile , @xmath8 , in contrast with @xmath9 for the standard disk .",
    "second , substantial radiation arises from inside the marginally stable last circular orbit at @xmath10 .",
    "this reflects the fact that , although the accretion velocity is large , near the speed of light close to a black hole , substantial material exists there because of the large @xmath11 .",
    "third , compared with the standard disk , the slim disk produces higher energy photons , but the number of photons is fewer .",
    "if we fit the spectra with a blackbody , we find small sizes for the emitting region , @xmath12 , and high temperatures , @xmath13 kev .    in figure 2 we plot the theoretical values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , together with the asca data for nls1s ( see @xcite for details ) . from these plots",
    ", we can safely conclude that all nls1s plotted here fall into the regions above @xmath16 .",
    "this justifies our assumption of large @xmath17 in nls1s .",
    "also , the derived black - hole masses are relatively small .",
    "a further issue is the variability .",
    "we pay special attention to the following characteristics of the variability : ( i ) fluctuation light curves seem to be composed of numerous flares ( or shots ) ; ( ii ) shot amplitudes and durations do not have typical values but are smoothly distributed ; ( iii ) occurrence of flares is nearly random .",
    "power spectra of such light curves show a @xmath18 decline ( with @xmath19 in normal seyferts ) at high frequencies .",
    "nls1s exhibit a more peaked profile and thus @xmath20 is smaller .",
    "it is often suggested that variability is due to magnetic reconnection leading to flares , as is the case in solar flares . to investigate this magnetic - flare model ,",
    "we have examined the 3d mhd simulation data @xcite , finding ( i ) spatial fractals in the @xmath21 distribution ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are current and matter densities , respectively ) and ( ii ) temporal @xmath18 fluctuations in the ohmic dissipation , @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is resistivity , see figure 3 ) .",
    "these two are closely related .",
    "when reconnection occurs in fractal magnetic fields , a variety of flare amplitudes arise , yielding @xmath18 fluctuations ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "if fluctuations are of a magnetic origin , large - amplitude fluctuations indicate a relatively large field energy compared with the radiation energy . in the standard - type disk",
    ", cooling is efficient . since the emitted radiation energy is comparable to the gravitational - energy release",
    ", the internal energy of the gas should be much less than the gravitational energy , which the magnetic field energy can not exceed .",
    "hence , the magnetic field energy is much less than the emitted radiation energy , leading to rather small fluctuations .    in the slim - disk case , on the other hand , radiative cooling is inefficient .",
    "it is the trapped photons that contain large energy comparable to gravitational energy , which greatly exceeds the emitted radiation energy .",
    "magnetic energy can grow to overcome the emitted radiation energy .",
    "thus , large fluctuations are inevitable in radiation from slim disks , consistent with the observations of nls1s .",
    "a more detailed discussion is presented elsewhere @xcite ."
