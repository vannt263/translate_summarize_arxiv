    "microwave measurements of the temperature dependence of the complex conductivity tensor @xmath16 of high-@xmath17 superconductors ( htsc ) have advanced considerably our understanding of the mechanisms of quasiparticles transport along crystallographic axes of these anisotropic compounds .",

    "the tensors @xmath25 and @xmath26 are characterized by two components : @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) in weakly anisotropic @xmath29-planes cuo@xmath4 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) perpendicular to these planes .    in the temperature range @xmath32 ,",

    "the common features of these crystals are the linear temperature dependence of the surface resistance ( @xmath35 ) and of the surface reactance ( @xmath36 ) at temperatures @xmath37 ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the difference is that the linear resistivity region extends to near @xmath38 for bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath34 and terminates near or below @xmath39 for yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 single crystals . at higher temperatures @xmath40 of yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6",

    "in addition , the @xmath41 curves of some yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 single crystals have unusual features in the intermediate temperature range @xcite .    in comparison with the microwave response of the cuprate layers of htsc , the data concerning their microwave properties in the direction perpendicular to these layers are scarce . moreover , the available experimental data are controversial . in this connection ,",
    "the major electrodynamic problem is the accuracy of the techniques used in determination of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in htsc .",
    "the most convenient technique for measurements of the surface impedance of small htsc samples in the x - w microwave frequency bands is the so - called ` hot - finger ' method @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of the method is that a crystal is set on a sapphire rod at the center of a superconducting cylindrical cavity resonating at the frequency @xmath44 in the @xmath45 mode , i.e. , at the antinode of a quasi - homogeneous microwave magnetic field . in the experiment the real @xmath46 and imaginary @xmath47 parts of the surface impedance",
    "are derived from the following relations : @xmath48    here @xmath49 is the sample geometrical factor ; @xmath50 is the difference between the values 1/q of the cavity with the sample inside and the empty one ; @xmath51 is the frequency shift relative to that which would be measured for a sample with perfect screening and no penetration of microwave fields . in the experiment we measure",
    "the difference @xmath52 between resonant frequency shifts versus temperature of the loaded and empty cavity , which is equal to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a constant . in htsc single crystals",
    "the constant @xmath54 can be determined from measurements of the surface impedance in the normal state @xcite .",
    "another quantity essential for determining the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( 2 ) is the sample geometric factor @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the energy stored in the cavity , @xmath59 is the volume of the cavity , @xmath60 is the microwave magnetic field generated in the cavity , @xmath61 is the total sample surface area , and @xmath62 is the tangential component of @xmath60 on the sample surface .",
    "the energy @xmath58 is easily obtained for the resonator mode under use , therefore the task of deriving the impedance value is reduced to defining the integral @xmath63 in eq .",
    "the task simplifies if a typical htsc crystal in the form of a rectangular plate with dimensions @xmath0 and volume @xmath64  mm@xmath65 is radiated by the microwave magnetic field @xmath66 ( @xmath67-orientation , fig .",

    "thus we obtain @xmath75 , so the surface impedance @xmath76 for the sample in the @xmath67-orientation will be equal to @xmath77 where the subscripts of @xmath78 denote the directions of the screening currents . while deriving formula ( 4 ) we neglect not only weak anisotropy in the @xmath29-plane but also a contribution of the crystal @xmath79-faces which is apparently minute in comparison with the summands in the numerator in eq .",

    "the cleaving of the crystal along the @xmath81-edge into several needles multiplies up the contribution from the @xmath2-axis , so that measurements of @xmath76 before and after the cleaving allowed to extract @xmath82 in the superconducting state of yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 single crystal @xcite .",
    "however , this procedure has the following disadvantages : ( i ) it assumes @xmath83 term in eq .",
    "( 4 ) to be non - alterable , which results in an uncontrolled inaccuracy due to non - ideal sample cleaving into rectangular needles , ( ii ) as it will be shown below , the size effect takes place at temperatures @xmath84 in the @xmath67-orientation ; this restricts applicability range of eq .",
