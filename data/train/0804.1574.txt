    "we have searched the spitzer space telescope archive ( with _ leopard _ ) for observations covering the positions of all low mass x - ray binaries with known optical counterparts listed in liu et al .",
    "table 1 details the data available for each source as of march 21 , 2008 .",
    "note that not all of the data listed in the table are public at the time of this writing . accepted cycle 5 programs are listed , but not yet observed . in table 2 we provide results as to whether a particular source is detected or not , together with published spitzer measurements of lmxbs . in this context , ( f ) denotes faint , in a most subjective fashion .",
    "( s ) indicates that some pixels of the source psf are saturated .",
    "we have found 17 newly detected sources in addition to the eight published spitzer detections of lmxbs .",
    "photometry of these sources is still ongoing and will be published at a later date .",
    "the research described in this poster was carried out , in part , at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , and was sponsored by the national aeronautics and space administration through a grant to the pi .",
    "we made use of data products from the 2 micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "it also utilized nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service and the simbad database operated by cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "<S> we present preliminary results from our archival spitzer space telescope program aimed at characterizing the mid - ir properties of compact objects , both isolated and in binary systems , i.e. white dwarfs , x - ray binaries , cataclysmic variables , and magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> most of these sources are too faint at mid - ir wavelengths to be observable from the ground , so this study provides the very first comprehensive look at the mid - ir emission of these objects . here </S>",
    "<S> we present our results for the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we considered all of the systems listed in the most recent catalog of liu et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2007 ) that have known optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the particular goals of our projects encompass : to establish the mid - ir spectral energy distribution , to search for the signatures of jets , circumbinary disks , low mass or planetary companions and debris disks , and to study the local environment of these sources . </S>"
