    "<S> a recent theoretical model predicts that the modification of quark distributions in the nuclear medium ( emc effect ) depends on the flavor of the quarks . </S>",

    "<S> this surprising finding , called the emc effect , was later confirmed by other dis experiments using electron , muon , and neutrinos beams  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the emc effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these models are capable of describing certain features of the emc effect , they span a wide range of underlying physics . the physics origin of the emc effect remains to be better understood .    </S>",
    "<S> an effective tool to shed additional light on this subject is to study the quark flavor dependences of the emc effect . </S>",
    "<S> this was clearly demonstrated by the measurements of the nuclear dependence of the proton - induced drell - yan process  @xcite , which was primarily sensitive to the @xmath1 quark distributions in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of the nuclear enhancement of @xmath1 distributions in these experiments has already provided strong constraints on various emc models  @xcite .    to further understand the emc effect </S>",
    "<S> , it would be very valuable to examine other flavor dependences of the emc effect . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the possible dependence of the emc effect on the flavor of valence quarks for an @xmath2 nucleus , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the numbers of neutrons and protons in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the feasibility for observing such flavor - dependent emc effect with @xmath0-boson production at the rhic and lhc colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility for a flavor - dependent modification of quark distributions in @xmath2 nuclei was recently considered by clot , bentz , and thomas ( cbt )  @xcite . in the cbt model , the isoscalar and isovector mean fields in a nucleus </S>",
    "<S> will modify the quark distributions in the bound nucleons according to the nambu - jona - lasinio model . </S>",
    "<S> these modified nucleon quark distributions will then be convoluted with nucleon s momentum distribution in the nucleus to obtain the nuclear quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the @xmath5 field , characterized by the @xmath6 coupling , is determined by the empirical symmetry energy of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath7 gev@xmath8 is obtained  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting consequence of this approach is that the presence of the isovector vector meson ( @xmath9 ) mean field in an @xmath2 nucleus will modify the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks in the bound nucleons differently , leading to flavor dependence of nuclear quark distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the cbt model can be compared with existing dis data . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath12 ratios , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the structure functions ( per nucleon ) of @xmath15 nuclear matter and deuteron , extracted by sick and day  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cbt model calculation , shown as the solid curve , is in good agreement with the data . for @xmath16 nuclei , such as @xmath17au and @xmath18pb , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 mean field causes stronger binding for the @xmath10 quarks compared to the @xmath11 quarks in the protons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the nuclear modification of the @xmath10-quark distribution is greater than that of the @xmath11-quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , where the dotted and dashed curves show the nuclear modification of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks , denoted as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , in the @xmath17au nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> note that for an @xmath21 nucleus , the @xmath9 mean field will lead to an opposite effect , namely , the @xmath11-quark distribution will be modified more by the nuclear medium than the @xmath10-quark distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> there are other reasons for different nuclear modifications of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks in an @xmath2 nucleus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the well - established difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quark distributions in the proton would lead to some difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 . this ` trivial ' flavor dependence is usually taken into account in emc models automatically when the nucleon parton distributions are weighted by the @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate the size of this ` trivial ' flavor dependence , the @xmath9 mean - field in the cbt model is turned off and the resulting @xmath22 and @xmath23 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 confirms that the effect of this ` trivial ' flavor dependence is much smaller than that caused by the @xmath9 mean - field .    </S>",
    "<S> since the inclusive dis on nuclear targets probes the combined nuclear medium effects of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks , they do not provide a sensitive test for the flavor - dependent emc effect predicted by the cbt model . </S>",
    "<S> several new measurements sensitive to the flavor - dependent emc effects have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> they include the parity - violating dis asymmetry proposed at the future jlab 12 gev facility  @xcite , the semi - inclusive dis on nuclear target first considered by lu and ma  @xcite and recently proposed at jlab  @xcite , and future pion - induced drell - yan experiments  @xcite . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> 4 we show the predicted @xmath0 production ratios as a function of the charged lepton s rapidity at @xmath31 tev using the nucleon and nuclear pdfs from the cbt model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curves are obtained by setting the @xmath9 mean field to zero in the cbt model . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the solid and dashed curves show that the measurement of various @xmath74 as a function of @xmath66 remains sensitive to the flavor dependence of the nuclear modification of valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal effect of the @xmath5 mean field is about 3.6% at y=-3.5 for @xmath27 , 3.6% at y=-4.5 for @xmath28 and 6.5% at y=-3.8 for @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> although the size of the predicted flavor - dependent emc effect is relatively small , we note that many systematic uncertainties , such as those associated with beam luminosity and detector acceptance , are largely cancelled for the proposed measurement of various ratios . </S>",
    "<S> first results on @xmath0 production at lhc  @xcite have shown that high - statistics precision measurements can be obtained with existing detectors . </S>",
    "<S> although the detector coverage for atlas and cms does not go beyond @xmath87 , the lhcb has good detector coverage up to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows that the expected statistical accuracy for a measurement at the lhcb with an integrated luminosity of 1 @xmath67 is sufficient to distinguish the solid from the dashed curves for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> since the cms and atlas experiments have excellent coverage for the mid - rapidity region ( @xmath89 ) , the shape of @xmath74 will be well determined by the lhc experiments over a broad rapidity range . </S>",
    "<S> this would allow a stringent test of any emc models , including the cbt model .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that this study uses the leading - order ( lo ) expressions for @xmath0 production . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary since the pdfs in the cbt model was obtained using the lo formalism </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to extend the calculations to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) once the corresponding pdfs for the cbt model become available . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo pdfs for the cbt model would be constrained by the existing extensive dis data on nuclear targets . moreover , future @xmath0-production cross section data in @xmath90 collision at lhc , including data with isoscalar beams such as @xmath91c and @xmath92ca , could become available . </S>",
    "<S> data involving isoscalar nuclear beams would provide strong additional constraints for the cbt model when no @xmath93 mean field is present . </S>",
    "<S> although the absolute values of the various ratios @xmath74 could depend on the choice of lo versus nlo calculations , it is expected that the relative effect of the @xmath5 mean field on @xmath74 should be insensitive to whether lo or nlo calculations are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the required sensitivities of the proposed measurements for identifying the flavor - dependent emc effect , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , should also be applicable in the nlo formualism .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , this study shows that @xmath0 production in @xmath90 collisions is sensitive to flavor dependence of the emc effect predicted by the cbt model . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified several @xmath0 production cross section ratios which are sensitive to the flavor - dependent emc effect . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed measurements , though quite challenging , are within the capability of the existing detectors at lhc and could be carried out in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> a reliable extraction of the flavor - dependent emc effect would also require future analysis based on nlo formulation for the cbt model and nuclear pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute @xmath0 production cross sections anticipated for @xmath90 collision at lhc would provide important additional constraints for the nlo analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the proposed measurements , together with future theoretical development , could lead to valuable new insight on the origin of the emc effect . </S>"
