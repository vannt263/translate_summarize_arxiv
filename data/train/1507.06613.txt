    "the nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2films grown with the standard target show a wide spread in the hall coefficient , especially at low temperatures , where the characteristic minimum has completely disappeared for the films annealed following the _ oxygen _ procedure , see figure [ fig:5](a ) .",

    "for the nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2films with extra copper we see a closer grouping of all the curves and they all show the characteristic minimum , see figure [ fig:5](b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that both a longer vacuum annealing and an oxygen annealing following a short vacuum annealing suppresses the cross - over to a positive hall coefficient , not depending on the presence of the parasitic ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4phase . in the latter case this can be explained by the counter - doping effect of oxygen , effectively shifting the doping away from optimal doping , towards underdoping @xcite .",
    "the former case is not immediately obvious .",
    "the cross - over to positive hall coefficients for the extra copper films with an 8 minute vacuum annealing , suggests that the samples are already at optimal doping or even overdoped .",
    "it has been shown that , during vacuum annealing , oxygen is removed from the cuo@xmath3 planes , suppressing anti - ferromagnetic ordering and promoting hole - like carriers @xcite .",
    "this is accompanied by an increased normal - state resistance for over - reduction @xcite , attributed to increased defect and impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "annealing for 45 minutes should therefore only shift the hall coefficient towards more hole - like character , as is commonly observed for oxygen reduction in nd@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "this is not what we observe , we do see an increased normal - state resistance , but the hall coefficients shifts toward more negative values .",
    "we suggest that as more and more oxygen is removed from the cuo@xmath3 planes , scattering is increased . as the hall coefficient for a two - band system",
    "is also linked to the mobility of the carriers , our observations can be explained by the scattering centers having more influence on the mobility of the hole - like carriers than on the electron - like carriers .",
    "this would explain both the higher normal state resistivity and the shift to a more negative hall coefficient .",
    "our experiments show that the addition of extra copper to the pld target of nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2can increase the quality and @xmath15 of thin films by suppressing the formation of the parasitic ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4phase . the presence or absence of the parasitic ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4phase in nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2films has a strong influence on @xmath15 and the transport properties above @xmath15 . for long reduction",
    "the difference is minimal , while the biggest difference is observed for strong oxygenation .",
    "the relative minor influence of the exact annealing procedure on @xmath15 and the hall coefficient for nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2films grown with extra copper in the target suggests that studies into the exact role of oxygen in the reduction process for _ n-_type cuprates should not overlook the influence the presence of the ( _ re_,ce)@xmath3o@xmath4parasitic phase can have .",
    "we have also shown that the nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2films with extra copper can even be subjected to a 1 bar oxygen annealing suitable for the growth of _ p-_type cuprates such as la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath2and yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath16 .",
    "this makes nd@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath2grown from a non - stoichiometric target with extra copper a prime candidate for studying _",
    "pn_-physics in the cuprate superconductors , opening the way to integrate electron - doped cuprates with their hole - doped counterparts on a single chip .",

    "<S> we show that the quality of nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2films grown by pulsed laser deposition can be enhanced by using a non - stoichiometric target with extra copper added to suppress the formation of a parasitic ( nd , ce)@xmath3o@xmath4phase . the properties of these films are less dependent on the exact annealing procedure after deposition as compared to films grown from a stoichiometric target . </S>",
    "<S> film growth can be followed by a 1 bar oxygen annealing , after an initial vacuum annealing , while retaining the superconducting properties and quality . </S>",
    "<S> this enables the integration of electron - doped cuprates with their hole - doped counterparts on a single chip , to create , for example , superconducting _ pn_-junctions . </S>"
