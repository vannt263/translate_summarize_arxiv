    "gas inflow and outflow play a very important role in galaxy evolution .",

    "further evidence is that the timescale of gas depletion in star - forming galaxies at low redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found that the outflow is ubiquitous at @xmath0 and the outflow rate is in the same order of magnitude as the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies .",
    "because inflow and outflow affect the gas mass ( and its fraction ) and gas - phase metallicity in a galaxy , efforts have been made to constrain the inflow and outflow rates to reproduce the observational relations such as the stellar mass - metallicity relation by using cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "some of the studies showed that galaxies evolve while maintaining the balance between the amounts of inflow gas , star formation , and outflow : inflow @xmath5 star formation @xmath6 outflow .",

    "they found the inflow , outflow , and star - formation rates decreased while satisfying the equilibrium condition at all the redshifts .",
    "however , no studies constrain the inflow and outflow rates at @xmath9 with chemical evolution models using molecular gas observations for the gas mass fraction .",
    "the advent of high - sensitivity radio telescopes recently enables us to detect co emissions from `` normal '' star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 .",

    "we adopted the metallicity - dependent co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor given by @xcite .",
    "because @xcite used the metallicity calibration of @xcite , we converted the metallicity using an empirical relation between the two metallicity calibrations obtained by @xcite .",
    "the resultant molecular gas masses for the subsamples with smaller and larger stellar mass are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , and the gas mass fractions ( @xmath49 , including the helium mass for @xmath50 ) are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the stellar masses , gas mass fractions , and metallicities of the subsamples are plotted with red stars in figure  [ fig : fitting ] together with individual galaxies ( black symbols ) ; the left , middle , and right panel are diagrams of gas mass fraction versus stellar mass ( @xmath53 vs @xmath54 ) , metallicity versus gas mass fraction ( @xmath55 vs @xmath53 ) , and metallicity versus stellar mass ( @xmath55 vs @xmath54 ) , respectively . in figure",

    "this limit leads to an upper gas mass fraction at a fixed stellar mass ( left panel of figure  [ fig : fitting ] ) and at a fixed metallicity ( middle panel of figure  [ fig : fitting ] ) , if we assume the stellar mass - metallicity relation at @xmath0 @xcite and the metallicity - dependent co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor @xcite . in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : fitting ] ,",
    "the upper limit of the gas mass fraction is very high at lower metallicity .",
    "this is because the stellar mass - metallicity relation we adopted implies a very small stellar mass for the lower metallicity galaxies , resulting into a very large gas mass fraction .",
    "a few of our galaxies are located in the gray shaded region in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : fitting ] .",
    "this is because they show large deviations from the assumed stellar mass - metallicity relation .",
    "we compare the observational data with an analytic model for chemical evolution in a galaxy considering the gas inflow and outflow .",
    "based on the description by @xcite , the equation for the evolution of gas is given as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total mass fraction which is restored to the interstellar medium by a stellar generation , @xmath61 is sfr , @xmath62 is the inflow ( accretion ) rate , and @xmath63 is the outflow ( wind ) rate . the evolution of metal mass in gas phase is given as @xmath64 where @xmath55 is the gas phase metallicity , @xmath65 is the yield , and @xmath66 is the metallicity of inflow gas .",

    "the assumption of an outflow rate proportional to the sfr would be appropriate if the galactic winds are mainly driven by supernovae explosions .",
    "the assumption of an inflow rate proportional to sfr would be reasonable if the amount of inflow gas is closely related to the mass of gas available to form stars .",

    "although the degeneracy between the inflow and outflow rates is severe in the fitting of each diagram , since the directions of the degeneracy in each diagram are different , the inflow and outflow rates can be constrained with a joint fit . since the three relations shown in figure  [ fig : fitting ] are not independent , in this paper",

    "as mentioned above , @xcite constrain the inflow and outflow rates at the same redshift .",
    "our result is consistent with that of @xcite ( ( @xmath74 , @xmath75@xmath91@xmath92 , @xmath93 ) ) within the errors .",
    "although the uncertainty of the inflow and outflow rate is large , the best - fit model shows that the inflow rate is roughly equal to the sum of the outflow rate and effective star - formation rate ( @xmath94 ) , which supports the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution .",
    "it should be noted that the inflow and outflow rates are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , if we adopt the chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass with the chabrier imf is converted from that with the salpeter imf by dividing by 1.7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the outflow rate is smaller than that derived with the salpeter imf , the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution is still supported .",
    "we also examine the inflow and outflow rates by using the subsamples with lower ( @xmath97 ) and higher ( @xmath98 ) metallicity ( details are described by @xcite ) .",
    "the average stellar masses are @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the subsamples with lower and higher metallicity , respectively .",
    "the stacked molecular gas mass fractions for the subsamples with lower and higher metallicity are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",

    "the joint fit gives an inflow rate of @xmath105 and outflow rate of @xmath106 , which are consistent with the result derived by using the subsamples based on stellar mass , within the errors .",
    "the result also supports the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution .    according to the study of co luminosity ratios for main - sequence galaxies at @xmath46 by @xcite ,",
    "the uncertainty of the luminosity ratio ( @xmath45 ) is about a factor of 2 . if we adopt the luminosity ratio of 0.12 , the inflow and outflow rates are @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , respectively .",
    "if we adopt the luminosity ratio of 0.46 , the inflow and outflow rates are @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , respectively . as the luminosity ratio is larger ( i.e. , molecular gas mass fraction is smaller ) , the inflow and outflow rates become large but the initial gas mass becomes small .    if we adopt the galactic co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor ( @xmath113 ) to derive the molecular gas mass , the inflow and outflow rates are @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the subsamples with smaller and larger stellar mass , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 for the subsamples with lower and higher metallicity .",
    "these best - fit values are consistent with those derived with the metallicity - dependent co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor . however , the @xmath118 of the joint fit is worse , and the best - fit models do not reproduce the observational data well in the diagram of @xmath55 vs @xmath53 which is not used for the joint fit .",
    "although the gas mass in the chemical evolution model includes the hi mass , the gas mass fraction of observational data used in this paper does not include it . according to a semi - empirical model by @xcite , the hi mass in a galaxy at @xmath0 with a halo mass of @xmath119 is half or comparable to the h@xmath1 mass .",
    "we examine the inflow and outflow rate assuming two cases that the hi mass in a galaxy is half of the h@xmath1 mass and the same amount of the h@xmath1 mass in a galaxy for the subsample with smaller / larger stellar mass . in these cases ,",
    "the gas mass fraction is defined as @xmath120 .",

    "the inflow and outflow rates are smaller and the initial gas mass is larger than those without hi mass . if we assume a larger hi mass than these ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) , the large amount of the initial gas mass causes a lower metallicity and the best - fit models in these cases are unable to reproduce the observed stacked values of metallicity .    while the value of outflow rate is consistent with zero within the error , the small number of stacked data points leads to the large uncertainty .",
    "@xcite showed galactic - scale superwinds exist in galaxies with a global sfr surface density exceeding 0.1  @xmath127 from observations of local starburst galaxies . because the sfr surface density in all of our sample , whose size is derived from _",
    "b_-band image , exceeds the threshold , the outflow rates of our sample may not be zero .",
    "we constrain the inflow and outflow rates in star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 by using the analytic model for the chemical evolution in a galaxy .",
    "the gas mass fractions of our sample are derived from co(5 - 4 ) observations with alma by adopting the metallicity - dependent co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor .",
    "the joint least @xmath118 fit of the analytic model to the result of stacking analysis for the subsample with smaller / larger stellar mass shows the inflow and outflow rates in the unit of sfr are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the result is consistent with that from the previous study in which the gas mass was derived from extinction corrected h@xmath2 luminosity and galaxy size by assuming the kennicutt - schmidt law .",
    "the inflow rate is roughly comparable to the sum of outflow rate and effective sfr , which supports the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution .",
    "the result is also consistent with that derived from the stacking analysis for subsamples with lower / higher metallicity .",
    "if we include the hi mass which is proportional to molecular gas mass , then lower inflow and outflow rates and larger initial gas masses are needed to explain the data .",
    "however , if we assume the amount of hi mass is larger than h@xmath1 mass , the chemical evolution model used in this paper produces much lower metallicity , and do not reproduce the stacked metallicity .",
    "the uncertainty of inflow and outflow rates is large due to the small number of stacked data points . to obtain more reliable constraints of inflow and outflow rates , we need to increase the number of co observations toward main - sequence galaxies with known metallicity covering wide ranges of stellar mass and metallicity .",
