    "it is now established that , similar to quarks , leptons mix @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of fermion mixing was identified long ago ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that we have ( at least ) three sets of each `` type '' of chiral fermion field ( @xmath5  ) and , while gauge interactions can not tell different generations apart , the interactions responsible for fermion masses can .    in the quark sector of the standard model ,",
    "it is well - known that the ambiguity in defining the different quark chiral fields allows one to describe the entire flavor sector of the quarks in terms of 10 parameters : six quark masses ( three for the up - type quarks , three for the down - type quarks ) and four real parameters in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( say , the wolfenstein parameters @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cabibbo angle , @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is also well - known ( but often not emphasized ) that one can choose all quark masses positive and all quark mixing angles to lie in the first quadrant ( for the wolfenstein parameters , this translates into @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .    in the lepton sector",
    "the situation is similar , with a couple of `` twists : '' the neutrinos may be majorana fermions , and the neutrino sector of the standard model can be easily enlarged to included so - called sterile neutrinos @xmath11 . unlike fourth - generation quarks or charged leptons , sterile neutrinos can arise from standard - model singlet chiral fermion fields , and mix with the so - called active neutrinos after electroweak symmetry is broken",
    ". not only are sterile neutrinos of virtually all masses allowed by all current neutrino data , they are natural consequences of several well - motivated scenarios that explain the origin of the majorana neutrino masses , including most versions of the seesaw mechanism @xcite . it has recently been emphasized that there are plausible reasons to expect the `` seesaw '' sterile neutrinos to be low - mass , propagating fields @xcite .    in the absence of sterile neutrinos , it is well - known @xcite that the flavor sector of the leptons is described in terms of 12 parameters : three charged - lepton masses , three neutrino masses , and six real parameters in the lepton mixing matrix , often referred to as the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix .",
    "the last are parameterized in terms of three real mixing angles ( @xmath12 ) and three complex phases .",
    "if the neutrinos are dirac fermions , two of the three complex phases are unphysical , while if one of the neutrino masses is identically zero , one of the three complex phases can be `` rotated away . ''    in this paper , we discuss the physical range of the lepton mixing parameters ( mixing angles and complex phases ) assuming that the neutrinos are majorana fermions and allowing for the presence of sterile neutrinos . by `` physical range ''",
    "we refer to the following question : ` given a proper definition of the different neutrino states , what values should the mixing parameters take in order to describe _ all _ physically distinguishable values of _ all _ observables ? ' .",
    "subsets of this discussion , usually concentrating on the mixing angles and the `` dirac '' phase , can be found elsewhere ( see , for example , @xcite for an incomplete list of references ) , and many of the results we present here in detail can be found throughout the literature .",
    "it is , however , our experience that the topic of the  physical \" lepton - mixing parameter space is often source of confusion and misunderstanding , even among seasoned neutrino aficionados .",
    "a coarse scan of the literature reveals several incorrect ( but , fortunately , mostly harmless ) statements and misunderstandings . for this reason alone ,",
    "we think such a discussion is useful .",
    "furthermore , a detailed discussion of the physical parameter space for majorana phases and the physical range for all parameters when there are sterile neutrinos is , to the best of our knowledge , new and , we hope , useful .",
    "several subtle aspects of the definition of fermion mixing never surfaced with great prominence in the quark sector , because ( a ) both quark flavor and mass eigenstates can be produced or detected , and ( b ) quark mixing angles turn out to be very small . in the lepton sector , even if one ignores the possibility of majorana neutrinos or sterile neutrino states , the situation is different . for all practical purposes , in the laboratory ,",
    "all neutrinos are produced as flavor eigenstates , and all neutrinos are detected as flavor eigenstates .",
    "moreover , lepton mixing angles are large ( or even maximal ) and preempt the most straight forward definition of the different neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phyrange ] , we carefully define the mixing matrix and describe how unphysical field redefinitions define an equivalence class of physical mixing matrices . we then discuss in detail the two , three and many majorana neutrino cases .",

    "[ sec : nonstandardint ] , we discuss how the situation would change in the presence of new neutrino interactions .",
    "we discuss both lepton - number violating and lepton - number conserving new neutrino interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results and offer some concluding remarks .",
    "three appendices contain , respectively , a detailed discussion of the notation we use to describe unitary matrices of different dimensionality , an example of a `` non - standard '' parameter - space choice that may be useful in the case of dirac cp - conservation , and approximate expressions for neutrino mixing matrices in the case of three active plus one or two sterile neutrinos .",
