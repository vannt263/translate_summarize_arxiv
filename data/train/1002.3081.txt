    "the problem is analogous to the one coming from the addition of unbounded operators , namely that for two spectral triples @xmath147 and @xmath148 associated to a c*-algebra @xmath149 the intersection @xmath150 may be too small to be a dense subalgebra of @xmath151    this problem does not arise when forming the sum used in the definition of @xmath152 since the algebra @xmath153 is the same for all summands .",
