    "our toy model is described by the lagrangian @xmath4 with the scalar potential @xmath5 it contains a real scalar field @xmath0 and a majorana fermion field @xmath6 . the symmetry @xmath7 forbids a tree - level mass term of the majorana fermion and the term @xmath1 in the scalar potential .",
    "a possible phase in the yukawa coupling constant @xmath8 can be absorbed into the field @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality we assume that @xmath8 is real and positive .",
    "alternatively , we may consider a dirac fermion in the toy model . in this case , there are two different chiral fields @xmath6 and @xmath9 and the lagrangian reads @xmath10 the transformation of the fermion field in equation  ( [ s ] ) can for instance be modified to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in order to forbid a fermion mass at the tree level .",
    "we will assume @xmath13 , which leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath14 with a tree - level vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath0 given by @xmath15 the tree - level masses @xmath16 of the fermion and the scalar , respectively , ensue .",
    "we are interested in the mass renormalization of this most simple spontaneously broken toy model because we want to employ a special renormalization scheme which imposes renormalization conditions on the vev  @xcite and on the two coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath17 , but not on the masses ; we want to discuss this scheme in the most simple environment where we do not have to face the complications by gauge theories and propagator mixing .",
    "we will explicitly compute the one - loop corrections to equation  ( [ tm ] ) .",
    "our motivation for considering this kind of mass renormalization is the following :    1 .   due to the renormalization of the vacuum expectation value and the coupling constants , the fermion and scalar masses must be automatically finite .",
    "it is the purpose of these notes to work out how the cancellation of divergences in the masses occurs .",
    "in particular , we want to elucidate the role of tadpoles  @xcite in the context of the scalar mass .",
    "2 .   at a later time , having in mind renormalizable flavour models for fermion masses and mixing , we intend to extend the model to an arbitrary number of fermion and scalar fields . in this case , there are , in general , more yukawa couplings than fermion masses and it seems practical to renormalize coupling constants and vevs instead of masses .",
    "a further motivation for such a scheme is given by flavour symmetries which may impose tree - level relations among the vevs and among the yukawa couplings and , therefore , also on the masses ; such relations will obtain finite corrections at the one - loop level .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ renormalization ]",
    "we describe the renormalization of the toy model .",
    "the one - loop fermion and scalar selfenergies , together with the cancellation of infinities and the corrections to equation  ( [ tm ] ) , are discussed in sections  [ fermion ] and  [ scalar ] , respectively . since for simplicity",
    "we use the @xmath2 scheme  @xcite for the renormalization of both the yukawa and @xmath18-coupling constant , we have a dependence of renormalized quantities on the renormalization scale parameter denoted by @xmath19 in our paper , which is worked out in section  [ independence ] .",

    "we confine ourselves to the majorana case because the treatment of the dirac case is completely analogous .",

    "thus the one - loop fermion mass is given by @xmath89 and we arrive at the result @xmath90",

    "it is obtained from the scalar four - point function as @xmath97    the renormalized scalar propagator has residue one at the physical mass @xmath98 and the physical mass is determined by its pole .",
    "this means that the selfenergy has to fulfill @xmath99 where the prime indicates derivation with respect to @xmath100 .",

    "the one - loop masses @xmath66 and @xmath63 depend explicitly on @xmath19 . however , the fermion and scalar masses , defined as pole masses , are physical observables and have to be independent of @xmath19 .",
    "since we have performed a one - loop computation , independence means that the @xmath19-dependence must cancel at one - loop order which implies that the implicit dependence of @xmath119 on @xmath19 must be canceled by the explicit dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath19 .",
    "the same has to hold for @xmath103 and @xmath63 . in the following",
    "we will demonstrate this and derive as well some useful other relations concerning the @xmath19-dependence .",
    "the point of departure is the relationship between bare and renormalized quantities and their counterterms  @xcite :    [ bb ] @xmath120    exploiting the fact that we do not go beyond one - loop order , we obtain from equation  ( [ bb ] ) formulae for the bare masses : @xmath121 derivation of the above equations with respect to @xmath19 and taking into account that bare quantities do not depend on @xmath19 , we arrive at @xmath122 to proceed further we bear in mind that @xmath85 and @xmath17 correspond to the same order in the loop expansion and that from equations  ( [ yb ] ) and  ( [ lambdab ] ) we obtain at lowest order @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "then , with the results of sections  [ fermion ] and  [ scalar ] , it is straightforward to derive , at order @xmath85 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 plugging these results into equations  ( [ rg - m0 ] ) and  ( [ rg - m0 ] ) , we find the _ implicit _ dependence of the tree - level masses on @xmath19 :    @xmath127    it is now trivial to see that derivation of @xmath66 , equation  ( [ final - m1 ] ) , and of @xmath63 , equation  ( [ final - m1 ] ) , with respect to the explicit dependence on @xmath19 leads to expressions with signs opposite to those of equations  ( [ rg1-m0 ] ) and  ( [ rg1-m0 ] ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 and @xmath98 are independent of @xmath19 at order @xmath85 and @xmath17 , which proves our statement in the beginning of this section .    finally , for completeness we also present the beta functions of @xmath8 , @xmath17  @xcite and  @xmath35 at one - loop order : @xmath128",
    "in this paper we have discussed renormalization in a minimalist model with a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry . we have employed a renormalization scheme which renormalizes the vev such that the one - point function of the shifted field @xmath39 defined in equation  ( [ split ] ) vanishes ; for simplicity we have renormalized the yukawa coupling constant @xmath8 and the quartic scalar coupling constant @xmath17 by the @xmath2 scheme . the renormalization condition for the vev implies that tadpole contributions to the selfenergies are canceled by the renormalization parameter @xmath3 of the vev . in this model , since there is no fermion mass term in the unbroken lagrangian , it is obvious that the one - loop fermion mass gets renormalized by the renormalization parameter @xmath41 .",
    "concerning the scalar mass , the mass counterterm of the scalar contains explicitly the tadpole contributions in @xmath92see equation  ( [ dm ] ) , therefore , both @xmath3 and @xmath42 are needed for the finiteness of the scalar mass @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , @xmath98 also receives a finite tadpole contribution .",
    "we have considered this toy model , which does neither have the complications due to gauge interactions  @xcite nor those due to propagator mixing  @xcite , in view of a future application to renormalizable flavour models .",
    "we emphasize that our renormalization scheme has the virtue of providing a clear formulation of the hierarchy or fine - tuning problem because it allows the comparison of the tree - level masses with their radiative corrections without obfuscation by a cut - off .",
    "in addition , it seems straightforward to extend the model to the case of an arbitrary number of fermion and scalar fields .",
    "finally , we mention that there is an interesting difference between the majorana and dirac fermion contribution to the one - loop mass of equation  ( [ final - m1 ] ) due to occurrence of @xmath59see equation  ( [ varsigma ] ) for its definition .",
