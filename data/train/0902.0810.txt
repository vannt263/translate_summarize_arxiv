    "the three - dimensional magnetic field structures and the particle populations of extragalactic jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are still not well understood . @xcite and @xcite have recently made progress in studying the 3-d magnetic field structures of kilo - parsec scale jets , but little is known about the 3-d field structure near the jet origin , on parsec or sub - parsec scales .",
    "we wish to know if the jet magnetic field shows a structure which has its roots in the magnetic field in the supermassive black - hole / accretion - disk system responsible for giving rise to the jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite has suggested a direct disk - jet connection on the basis of x - ray / radio correlations , and this connection may extend to the magnetic field which threads the accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "unanswered questions include , for example , is there significant vector - ordered poloidal field along the jet axis or perhaps a toroidal / helical field structure confining the jet and indicating a jet current @xcite ?",
    "it is also unknown whether the particle population of jets is primarily electron - proton , @xmath3 , or electron - positron , @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we parameterize this unknown as the lepton number , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number densities of electrons and positrons respectively .",
    "additionally , the limits on the power - law particle spectrum which gives rise to the observed synchrotron radiation are poorly constrained .",
    "the relativistic number density can be parameterized as @xmath8 for @xmath9 where it is assumed to have a hard cutoff to the power - law at both high and low energies .",
    "@xcite found that the lower cutoff @xmath10 set the scale for the bulk kinetic luminosity of jets because the low energy particles dominate the particle density .    with sub - milliarcsecond resolution ,",
    "very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of extragalactic radio jets can study synchrotron emission from jets within a few parsecs of the jet origin .",
    "measurements of linear polarization from milli - arcsecond jets are sensitive to the net magnetic field order in the plane of the sky ; however , multiple 3-d magnetic field structures can all yield the same observed linear polarization . for example",
    ", a transverse shock of tangled magnetic field , a toroidal field , or a high - pitched helical field will all produce linear polarization with the electric field vector parallel to the jet axis .",
    "likewise , a vector - ordered poloidal field , shear in a tangled field , or a low - pitch helical field will all produce linear polarization with the electric field vector transverse to the jet axis .",
    "faraday rotation of linear polarization is sensitive to magnetic field order along the line of sight and to the properties of the particles doing the rotation .",
    "the observed faraday rotation must , in some cases , result from thermal particles and magnetic fields which are along the line of sight but external to the jet , but for rotations smaller than about @xmath11 , it is difficult to distinguish internal from external faraday rotation without additional information @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have attributed faraday rotation gradients observed approximately transverse to jets as evidence of toroidal or helical magnetic fields either in the jet itself or in a sheath layer around the jet @xcite ; however , these gradients are often gradients in magnitude of a single sign of the observed rotation and do not show the clear anti - symmetric signature expected for such fields , so an additional external faraday screen must be proposed as well . alternatively the observed gradients in rotation measure could be due to density gradients in the material surrounding the jet . in the case of 3c273 ,",
    "the case for toroidal or helical fields is stronger as the same direction of the gradient is observed at multiple jet locations @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also argued for helical field structure in bl lacertae based on temporal rotations in linear polarization angle from the jet core region .",
    "parsec - scale observations of circular polarization from extra - galactic jets provide additional constraints that can break some of the degeneracies inherent in linear polarization observations .",
    "circular polarization may be generated either as an _ intrinsic _ component of the emitted synchrotron radiation or via faraday _ conversion _ of linear polarization into circular polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . like faraday rotation ,",
    "_ conversion _ is a bi - refringence effect ; however , unlike rotation , conversion is much stronger in relativistic particles than thermal particles , and we do nt expect significant faraday conversion from magnetic fields and particles external to the jet @xcite . in this way ,",
    "circular polarization probes the jet magnetic fields and particles directly without modification from external screens .",
    "parsec - scale circular polarization observations of agn jets have been reported by @xcite , and most recently by @xcite .",
    "most agn jets appear to have less than @xmath12 to @xmath13% circular polarization , with 10% to 20% of jets detected at the level of @xmath14% to @xmath15% of the stokes @xmath0 emission from or very near the base of the jet ( or `` jet core '' ) .",
    "the highest levels of circular polarization detected are @xmath16 to @xmath17% of the local stokes @xmath0 emission in the core region of the nearby radio galaxy 3c84 @xcite and in the intra - day variable source pks 1519@xmath18273 @xcite .",
    "single dish monitoring of circular polarization from agn jets by the umrao has been ongoing since 2002 @xcite , and the austrian compact telescope array has studied the integrated circular polarization from agn @xcite .",
    "circular polarization has also been observed in intra - day variable sources , micro - quasars , low luminosity agn , and the galactic center @xcite . to date , no strong correlations have been found between the appearance of circular polarization and other source properties @xcite ; however , the lack of strong correlations may simply be related to the small fraction of detected sources and the low levels of circular polarization in those objects .",
    "there is increasing evidence that at least some circularly polarized sources tend to have a preferred `` handedness '' of circular polarization @xcite suggesting a persistent magnetic field structure is responsible for setting the sign of the observed polarization , although it is important to note that changes in sign have been observed in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to date ,",
    "radiative transfer modeling of parsec - scale circular polarization has been at only one or two frequencies , limiting our ability to uniquely constrain physical jet properties .",
    "@xcite preferred a model for 3c279 where circular polarization was produced via faraday conversion of linear into circular polarization and this conversion was driven by some internal faraday rotation .",
    "their results implied a low cutoff in the relativistic particle spectrum of @xmath19 , suggesting the jet was dominated by electron - positron pairs to keep the jet s kinetic luminosity within reasonable bounds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , subsequent work by @xcite and @xcite showed that some addition of thermal matter to the jet allowed a larger value for @xmath10 , reducing the need for a electron - positron dominated jet .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also preferred faraday conversion models for pks 0607@xmath18157 and 3c84 respectively . @xcite",
    "have linked the observation of transverse rotation measure gradients with parsec - scale circular polarization observations in a qualitative fashion to show that both observations are consistent with helical magnetic fields if all eight jets in their sample emerge from the south magnetic pole of the central engine .    to make progress on using parsec - scale circular and linear polarization observations of agn jets to constrain their magnetic field structure and particle populations",
    ", we have embarked on a program to study the linear polarization , circular polarization , and stokes @xmath0 spectra of agn jets at six frequencies with the vlba .",
    "we call these `` full polarization spectra '' of agn jets , as we use all four stokes parameters to constrain radiative transfer models .",
    "we combine these single - epoch , parsec - scale data with integrated monitoring by the umrao at 4.8 , 8.0 , and 14.5 ghz . the first vlba observations in this program took place in november of 2005 for 18 jets .",
    "we detected strong circular polarization at multiple frequencies in three jets : 3c84 , 3c279 , and 3c380 .",
    "here we report our results on 3c279 .",
    "future papers will explore 3c84 and 3c380 , as well as the sources in our sample with little or no detected circular polarization . in ",
    "[ s : obs ] we describe our observations , calibration , and gaussian modeling of the core region of 3c279 to obtain spectra for fitting . in  [ s : rad ] we describe a variety of possible models for producing circular and linear polarization in jets and then use analytic and computational radiative transfer models to fit the full polarization spectra obtained in  [ s : obs ] .",
    "we discuss the results of the radiative transfer modeling in ",
    "[ s : discuss ] , and our conclusions appear in  [ s : conclude ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology where @xmath20 km / s / mpc , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and so at the redshift of 3c279 ( @xmath23 ) , one milli - arcsecond corresponds to a projected linear scale of 6.34 parsecs .",
    "in 2005 , november 17@xmath1820 , we observed 18 agn radio jets with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) at six frequencies : 8.01 ghz , 8.81 ghz , 12.35 ghz , 15.37 ghz , 22.23 ghz , and 24.35 ghz .",
    "the observations were recorded at each frequency in dual circular polarization with single - bit recording at four intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) of 8 mhz bandwidth for a total bandwidth of 32 mhz .",
    "the observations were made over a continuous 72 hour period to minimize the effects of source variability with each of three 24 hour segments devoted to a pair of frequencies : 8.0 and 22 ghz , 12 and 15 ghz , and 8.8 and 24 ghz respectively .",
    "each source was visited 9 times at each observing frequency with these `` scans '' highly interleaved with neighboring sources to maximize ( u , v)-plane and parallactic angle coverage .",
    "scan lengths were approximately 300 seconds at 22 and 24 ghz , 215 seconds at 12 and 15 ghz , and 130 seconds at 8.0 and 8.8 ghz .",
    "each source thus obtained approximately 45 minutes integration time per frequency at 22 and 24 ghz , 32 minutes at 12 and 15 ghz , and 19 minutes at 8.0 and 8.8 ghz .",
    "our calibrated stokes i and polarization images at each of these frequency bands appear in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "a - priori data calibration , fringe - fitting , self - calibration , and calibration for linear and circular polarization were performed at denison university using the techniques described in detail by @xcite and @xcite . at 15.4 ghz ,",
    "the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) of the linear polarization was calibrated by comparing to the mojave database of rotated d - terms , as described in @xcite . at the other frequencies",
    ", we used the polarization of eight well defined jet components and looked at their deviations from the 15 ghz calibration ( which was taken as absolute ) ; although there was some clear faraday rotation in three of the components , the offsets at each frequency were remarkably consistent .",
    "we did make corrections for the apparent rotation measures of those three components , but our calibration is not strongly dependent on those values .",
    "indeed , if we rely on only the five components without apparent faraday rotation , we get the same calibration to within a degree at each frequency . based on the scatter of the offsets between components",
    ", we estimate that our evpa calibration is good to better than one degree at 12 ghz and below , and good to better than two degrees at 22 and 24 ghz .",
    "these numbers are relative to the 15 ghz calibration , which we expect to be accurate to within one degree , @xcite ; however , relative calibration between the frequencies is our main concern here for the modeling of the emission region . in our results",
    "we therefore consider only calibration uncertainty relative to 15 ghz added in quadrature with modeling uncertainty .",
    "circular polarization calibration was done via the gain transfer technique described in detail by @xcite , including their monte carlo methods to estimate the final uncertainty in the observed circular polarization .",
    "we have made some small improvements upon the methods described there to allow semi - automatic flagging of antennas and some individual scans that show a high rcp / lcp gain ratio .",
    "in particular we flagged an antenna if the standard deviation of its rcp / lcp antenna gain ratio was more than twice the median standard deviation of all the antennas .",
    "this requirement only resulted in the flagging of the ov antenna at 8.0 ghz which had a very large ( factor of @xmath24 ) gain discrepancy between the right and left hand feeds .",
    "we also flagged individual scans if their rcp / lcp ratio deviated by more than 5 times the standard deviation from the smoothed gains . in practice",
    "this accounted for a very small percentage , @xmath25 percent , of the overall scans being flagged .",
    "as described in @xcite , we also excluded sources with low snr , as indicated by large rcp / lcp gain fluctuations , or with apparently high levels of circular polarization , as indicated by a larger rcp / lcp gain offset from the smoothed gains , from contributing to the final smoothed gain - transfer table which would determine the overall circular polarization calibration . from the smoothed gains",
    "] these requirements excluded only between one and three sources from contributing to the final gain smoothing at each frequency , except at 24 ghz where seven sources were excluded , likely due to lower overall snr at that frequency .",
    "our circular polarization observations at 12 ghz were corrupted by strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , likely from geostationary satellites passing within the telescope beam , so we do not report circular polarization results at that frequency .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , phase calibration for circular polarization is complicated if a source has significant extended structure in stokes @xmath0 .",
    "this may lead to spurious anti - symmetric structure in the resulting circularly polarized images due to phase errors in earlier steps in the calibration . to account for this effect",
    ", we use the same approach described and tested by @xcite of adding an extra round of phase self - calibration , assuming no circular polarization in the data . in general this extra round of phase self - calibration",
    "is very effective in removing genuine phase gain errors while preserving the original circularly polarized signal ; although @xcite did find that the amplitude of the circularly polarized signal may be reduced by a few percent up to 10% and the position of the circular polarization was shifted a small amount , less than about half a beam - width , to better align with the source peak .",
    "real circularly polarized structure significantly away from the source peak was not shifted by the procedure . in the case of a source with a broad core region",
    ", @xcite found that the circular polarization may be spread by this procedure to encompass the whole region .    in recognition of the potential uncertainty of the precise placement of the circular polarization within the core region of 3c279 , we measured the integrated amount of circular polarization in the core region at each frequency using a single gaussian component in the ( u , v)-plane , and these results",
    "are reported in table 1 .",

    "the circular polarization is most likely associated with some combination of d and 5 . at 22 and 24",
    "ghz , we are confidently able to assign the measured circular polarization to component d at the base of the jet . to confirm this , we ran tests of our phase calibration procedure at 22 and 24 ghz by generating simulated data with the same stokes @xmath0 structure as the clean component models at these frequencies , but with the addition of a 10 or 20 mjy circularly polarized component at the locations of components 5 or 4 with the remaining circular polarization on component d. we found that the extra round of phase - calibration assuming zero circular polarization was not able to move circular polarization that originated on components 5 or 4 to component d. these results give us confidence that the circular polarization observed on component d indeed originated on component d and was not transferred there by our phase calibration .",
    "we used the caltech vlbi program _",
    "@xcite to model the stokes @xmath0 structure and linear polarization of 3c279 at each frequency with particular attention to the structure of the core region which produces the observed circular polarization .",
    "one challenge to this process is that the angular resolution of our observations differs by a factor of three between 8.0 and 24 ghz . to fit a comparable model over this range of resolution",
    ", we required that the relative separation , sizes , and shapes of the gaussian components remain the same from one frequency to another ; however , we allowed the fluxes of each component to vary as well as the overall phase center of the model .",
    "one difficulty with this approach is that no single collection of model components will be ideal for all frequencies , so in total we repeated this process to fit seven separate sets of model components in this fashion .",
    "each of these separate sets of model components explored somewhat different assumptions for how the structure of the core region and the remainder of the source was fit .",
    "for example , in some cases we fit elliptical gaussians to the core region and in other cases circular gaussian .",
    "we also tried varying the relative positions of the core components as well as the properties and numbers of components used to describe the rest of the jet . taken together , these seven different sets of model components sampled a range of reasonable possibilities for fitting the structure of 3c279 .",
    "overall the results for the core region were quite similar from one possibility to the next , and in table 2 we report the average fluxes and polarizations from these different possibilities for each of the main core components .",
    "the uncertainties for the component properties given in table 2 include calibration uncertainties added in quadrature with the standard deviation of the component values from the seven different sets of model components .",

    "our objective in this section is to model the magnetic field structure and particle properties in the core region of the parsec - scale jet of 3c279 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 provide a large number of constraints : stokes @xmath0 spectra for each component , fractional linear polarization ( lp ) , @xmath96 , as a function of frequency for each component , electric vector position angle ( evpa ) , @xmath97 , as a function of frequency for each component , and finally , fractional circular polarization ( cp ) , @xmath98 , for the entire core region at low frequency and for component `` d '' at high frequency .    in the analysis that follows , we take the jet to have a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath99 at an angle of @xmath100 to the line of sight , giving a doppler factor of @xmath101 for the jet .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the recent kinematical analysis of @xcite .",
    "similar but slightly larger values are found by @xcite : @xmath102 and @xmath103 , giving @xmath104 . both sets of values give an observed angle in the frame of the emitting fluid of @xmath105 , and our results are not strongly dependent on which set of values we choose .",
    "if we did choose the `` larger '' value for the doppler factor , it becomes somewhat easier to produce circular polarization via the intrinsic mechanism , as the estimated field strengths derived for the emission regions are somewhat larger ( see  [ s : speci ] ) .",
    "before we begin the detailed analysis , we will briefly outline five major models of circular polarization production which may be relevant to this source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    model ( 1 ) is stochastic production of circular polarization from a purely tangled magnetic field . in this model",
    ", the cp could be produced by either the intrinsic or faraday conversion mechanisms , or some combination of the two .",
    "this model requires a fairly coarse - grained magnetic field tangling to do the job , as the sign of the produced circular polarization will differ from cell - to - cell , leading to square - root@xmath18n style cancellation .",
    "a key prediction of this model is that the circular polarization should vary in sign and amount across different frequencies , which probe different parts of the jet near optical depth equals unity",
    ". we would also expect in this model that the cp would vary with time as the details of the magnetic field tangling change as the jet flows outward .",
    "our observations of 3c279 clearly show a consistency of sign and magnitude of circular polarization across the frequency bands , and previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has shown that 3c279 has maintained the same sign of circular polarization at high frequency for a decade now despite having a fast flowing jet and several outbursts over that period .",
    "the umrao has also observed a consistent sign of positive cp in 3c279 at 14.5 ghz from 2003 through 2007 , see figure [ f : umrao ] ; however , the umrao also finds periodic switches to negative cp at 4.8 ghz which we discuss in  [ s : discuss ] as a possible opacity effect . based on these results",
    ", we conclude that stochastic production of cp in a random magnetic field is not a major mechanism producing the cp we see in 3c279 . in the analysis that follows",
    ", we will therefore assume that any tangled portion of the magnetic field in 3c279 is tangled on a very short length - scale to minimize the production of stochastic cp and allow exploration of the contribution by organized magnetic fields .",
    "model ( 2 ) is intrinsic circular polarization from a strong , vector - ordered magnetic field , hereafter _",
    "intrinsic circular polarization_. given the consistency across epoch and frequency in the observed circular polarization of 3c279 , the most plausible candidate for such a vector - ordered field in the jet is a poloidal field along the jet axis .",
    "we can estimate the strength of such a field .",
    "if the magnetic field were completely uniform ( no reversals or tangling ) , the expected circular polarization would be of order @xmath106 where @xmath107 mhz is the electron gyro - frequency and @xmath108 is the emitted frequency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so for @xmath109 cp at 22 ghz , the required magnetic field strength is about @xmath110 mg .",
    "this is not an unreasonable field strength , and as we shall see in  3.4.2 , is of the order of the estimated field strength in component `` d '' .",
    "it is important to note that the above estimate assumes not only a uniform magnetic field , but also that all of the emitting particles are electrons",
    ". this will be the case in a `` normal '' matter jet consisting of a pure electron - proton plasma .",
    "allowing for the possibility of some admixture of electron - positron pairs , parameterized by the lepton number , @xmath111 , defined in the introduction , the fractional circular polarization is @xmath112 and the required field strength would scale as @xmath113 .    model ( 3 ) is faraday conversion of linear polarization into circular polarization driven by faraday rotation , hereafter _ rotation driven conversion_. in this model the lp is produced by whatever magnetic field order is available in the jet , such as shocked or sheared magnetic field .",
    "however , that lp can not be directly converted into cp by the same field order because there needs to be some offset between the position angle of the lp and the angle of the magnetic field doing the conversion .",
    "the angular offset is provided by internal faraday rotation within the jet , and in this model , the faraday rotation depth is relatively small so that the field at the front of the jet is converting the lp emitted by the back of the jet into some cp .    for this to be a consistent ( not stochastic ) process ,",
    "the faraday rotation must be provided by some vector - ordered field in the jet , probably a poloidal field along the jet axis as in model ( 2 ) .",
    "additionally , there must also be some preponderance of electrons in the jet relative to positrons , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "however , the requirements for some vector - ordered field and some preponderance of electrons in the jet plasma are not nearly as strong as they are for model ( 2 ) , where the cp is produced entirely by the intrinsic mechanism .",
    "model ( 3 ) has the additional requirement of low energy particles within the jet to produce the internal faraday rotation , either due to a low cutoff , @xmath10 , in the relativistic particle power - law spectrum @xmath115 for @xmath116 or due to the addition of some `` cold '' , non - relativistic thermal matter to the jet .",
    "it is interesting to note that the similarity in requirements between models ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) means that they will often act together to at least some degree .    model ( 4 ) is a high rotation depth version of model ( 3 ) , proposed and investigated independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the requirements are almost the same as for model ( 3 ) , but the rotation depth is much larger , so large , in fact , that significant rotation and conversion can happen over very small length scales in the jet .",
    "as long as this sense of rotation is common in all parts of the jet , no large scale magnetic field order is required ( except for the vector - ordered field which produces the rotation ) and net circular polarization can be produced in potentially large amounts with little if any net linear polarization @xcite .",
    "model ( 5 ) is faraday conversion from a helical magnetic field or other field structure which varies systematically in orientation across the jet . in this model , no internal faraday rotation",
    "is required , as the field orientation at the back of the jet is already at some angle with respect to the field orientation at the front of the jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have written a numerical simulation that solves the full - stokes equations of radiative transfer @xcite either by numerical integration or , optionally , by using the exact solutions calculated by @xcite .",
    "an early version of this simulation was used by @xcite to interpret the first parsec - scale circular polarization observations on 3c279 .",
    "the simulation models the emission from a `` homogeneous '' line of sight broken into cells where each cell has the same physical properties , including spectral index , @xmath117 , lepton number , @xmath111 , doppler factor , @xmath118 , viewing angle , @xmath119 , and low energy power - law cutoff for the relativistic particle distribution , @xmath10 .",
    "the exception to this is the magnetic field , which may consist of multiple components which can vary in direction and/or magnitude from cell to cell depending on the magnetic field model applied .",

    "the rotation driven conversion model is attractive as the sign , amount , and spectrum of circular polarization produced is nearly fixed by the observed properties of the linear polarization .",
    "in contrast , the helical magnetic field model , model ( 5 ) from  [ s : models ] , has fewer constraints because here we assume that all of the observed faraday rotation is external to the jet , so as to assess the ability of the helical field itself to produce the observed circular polarization . as above",

    "the spectrum of the circular polarization from the helical field falls off more slowly than for the rotation driven conversion case , but the levels are small enough at 15 ghz and above to still be acceptable .",
    "this shallower spectrum is due to the fact that the helical field produces cp via pure faraday conversion and depends only upon @xmath226 , whereas rotation driven conversion depends on the product of @xmath212 which includes two powers of the optical depth .",

    "additionally , the observed levels of linear polarization at high frequency ( 2@xmath183% ) are too low to generate the nearly @xmath190% corresponding circular polarization if the linear polarization is taken as a direct measure of the field order . in all likelihood ,",
    "faraday rotation and depolarization , either internal or external to the jet , are responsible for the offset evpas and the low observed levels of linear polarization .",

    "where @xmath317 is the number ratio of cold to relativistic particles in the jet @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous component d lies at the very base of the parsec scale radio jet , and we argue in  [ s : specp_compd ] that its stokes @xmath0 and polarization spectra can be well modeled by a @xcite and @xcite style conical jet with magnetic field and particle strengths that scale as power - laws with distance from the jet origin .",
    "we prefer a physical model for component d where the linear polarization is depolarized and rotated by the same magnetic field and particles in the jet which produce the stokes @xmath0 emission , linear polarization , and circular polarization .",
    "these circumstances provide the strongest constraints on the physical properties of the jet magnetic fields and particles as these properties alone must produce consistent amounts and directions of both linear and circular polarization across multiple frequencies . the physical model required by these constraints",
    "is dominated by a vector - ordered magnetic field along the jet axis with @xmath296 which does three things : ( 1 ) produces the observed linear polarization , ( 2 ) generates internal faraday rotation which rotates the evpa and depolarizes the linear polarization to the low fractional levels observed , and ( 3 ) produces the observed circular polarization largely as _ intrinsic _ circular polarization , although there is some contribution from _ rotation - driven conversion _ of the linear polarization into circular .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dominant mechanism for producing circular polarization in components 5 and 4 is rotation driven conversion , not intrinsic circular polarization ; however , these homogeneous components are not dominated by vector - ordered magnetic field along the jet axis which would be required for efficient intrinsic circular polarization production . in fact , for components 5 and 4 , some fraction of vector - ordered field , @xmath125 , is required to generate the necessary internal faraday rotation , and indeed _ the same polarity _ of vector - ordered field is required in components 5 and 4 as we deduce for component d.      for our model of the inhomogeneous component d , we required the vector - ordered field to scale as @xmath259 along the jet axis , consistent with conservation of magnetic flux in a conical jet .",
    "continued conservation of magnetic flux further down the jet in components 5 and 4 would leave some smaller fraction of vector - ordered field in these components with the same polarity . for components 5 and 4 ,",
    "it is not possible to compute the required magnetic flux because , as described in ",
    "[ s : discuss_comp54 ] , @xmath125 is tied to other unknown parameters , and it is also not clear whether components 5 and 4 , which are on different structural position angles , occupy the entire jet width at their location or represent bright spots within a jet with a wider opening angle . however , these limitations do nt apply to component d which has @xmath296 , and we can estimate the jet magnetic flux by fitting the transverse size of component d in our vlba data .",
    "we find the transverse size to be in the range @xmath318 mas ; however , we note that we are at the very limits of our resolution here and can only use this value to estimate the jet magnetic flux . to convert from gaussian fwhm to diameter of the jet ,",
    "we multiply by @xmath319 @xcite , and at a redshift @xmath320 , 1 mas corresponds to a linear scale of 6.3 parsecs for standard cosmological parameters of @xmath321 km / s / mpc , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for @xmath322 and @xmath323 g , the net magnetic flux in the jet is in the range @xmath324 g cm@xmath168 .",
    "this net magnetic flux is , to our knowledge , the first estimate of the magnetic flux carried by a jet that takes proper account of the vector order of the magnetic field . in the absence of field line reconnection or entrainment , it is a conserved quantity and is therefore equal to the net poloidal magnetic flux at the central engine .",
    "if the field originates in the black hole magnetosphere , then the expected magnetic flux for an eddington black hole is @xmath326 @xmath327 g cm@xmath168 ( wardle & homan 2003 , after correcting an arithmetic error ; begelman , blandford & rees 1984 ) .",
    "setting this equal to the measured magnetic flux implies a black hole mass in the range @xmath328 @xmath329 in 3c279 .",
    "this would be at the top of the range of measured or inferred black hole masses found in the literature @xcite but is not implausible ; however , this estimate is an order of magnitude larger than the inferred black hole mass for 3c279 itself @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the poloidal magnetic field may be anchored in the accretion disk , generally leading to larger magnetic fluxes because the area is much larger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter paper ,",
    "the net magnetic fluxes in the two models presented are @xmath330 g cm@xmath168 and @xmath331 g cm@xmath168 ( vlahakis , private communication ) which span our estimated range .",
    "the concordance between estimated and expected values suggests that circular polarization measurements can indeed measure a fundamental property of the central engine , and may even enable discrimination between models .",
    "the other physical parameter of interest constrained by this model is the lepton number @xmath111 , which we find to be @xmath15 in all of our plausible models ; however , the next smallest value we tested was @xmath332 .",
    "the lepton number is most strongly constrained by the circular polarization which is largely due to instrinsic circular polarization in this model .",
    "smaller values of @xmath111 require larger values of @xmath171 , such that @xmath113 , so if @xmath208 for @xmath333 g as we find here , @xmath332 would correspond to @xmath334 g. on @xmath111 is further complicated by the fraction of uniform field , @xmath125 , such that the quantity @xmath335 is approximately constant for @xmath125 near unity ; however , as @xmath125 is already @xmath336 not much additional reduction in @xmath111 can be gained by increasing @xmath125 . ] pushing this further , values as small as @xmath337 might be allowed for stronger magnetic fields up to a few gauss ; however , larger values of @xmath171 produce correspondingly larger values of the magnetic flux which is already quite large when estimated assuming @xmath338 g , see ",
    "[ s : flux ] . additionally , from our observed flux density , angular size , and estimated optical depth at 22 ghz , we estimated @xmath339 g in ",
    "[ s : bfield_strength ] , and while differing from this value by a factor of a few is certainly possible , the large deviations required for @xmath337 or less are implausible .",
    "we therefore find that in this model , the jet in 3c279 is at least dynamically dominated by protons with @xmath111 likely to be greater than or equal to about @xmath304 , corresponding to @xmath1% of the radiating particles being electrons .",
    "in the first parsec - scale circular polarization study of 3c279 , @xcite preferred a jet dominated by electron - positron pairs , and their argument was based on their conclusion that @xmath19 and therefore a jet dominated by electron - positron pairs was required by kinetic luminosity arguments originated by @xcite . applying the same calculation as @xcite for jet energy flux to these observations , we derive a similar constraint with @xmath340 $ ] ergs / s .",
    "this calculation assumes a magnetic field strength of @xmath287 g and , like that of @xcite , assumes equipartition between the magnetic field and particle energies .",
    "therefore , this calculation should be taken as a lower limit on the jet kinetic luminosity when the field strength is @xmath284 g. @xcite found a value for @xmath341 about twice this , and they concluded that @xmath19 required a mostly electron - positron jet to avoid carrying much more energy than appears to be dissipated on larger scales .",
    "it should be noted that in our model here , because the field strength , @xmath171 , scales roughly with @xmath342 , reducing @xmath111 far below 1.0 does not reduce the energy carried by the jet , but rather increases it sharply as @xmath343 .",
    "it seems that in this picture for component d there are only two ways to reduce the energy carried by the jet in the calculation given above .",
    "the first is reducing the magnetic field strength , which is possible as we had at least one model with @xmath301 g when we tried power - law indices of @xmath299 and @xmath300 , as described in  3.4.2 .",
    "the second is by increasing @xmath10 .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , work by @xcite and @xcite showed that the addition of thermal plasma to the jet generates enough internal faraday rotation to allow larger values of @xmath10 therefore relaxing the constraint on @xmath10 found by @xcite . in the model for component d",
    "explored here , a similar ambiguity exists for the value of @xmath10 .",
    "all of our plausible models have @xmath344 ; however , this constraint on @xmath10 is driven by the need to generate enough internal faraday rotation and depolarization by the relativistic plasma itself and the addition of thermal matter to the jet would relax this constraint on @xmath10 .",
    "our models for components 5 and 4 provide separate limits of @xmath2 , based on faraday conversion , that are not subject to this ambiguity .",
    "taken together , the uncertainties in the value of @xmath227 and @xmath10 allow for smaller values of @xmath341 , perhaps an order of magnitude smaller than that calculated by @xcite .",
    "the model described for component d in the previous sections is of an inhomogeneous jet which is dominated by vector - ordered , poloidal field along the jet axis . in this model ,",
    "the poloidal magnetic field is responsible for generating the observed circular polarization as intrinsic circular polarization , and the same field provides the internal faraday rotation and depolarization which produces the relatively low levels of observed linear polarization with a distinctly rotated evpa which is offset from the jet axis .",
    "the inhomogeneous nature of the component explains the stokes @xmath0 spectrum , the circular polarization spectrum , and the approximately flat spectrum for the fractional linear polarization and its evpa , despite the large faraday depth required .",
    "it is these properties that we consider to be robust aspects of our model , and they lead naturally to our constraints on the composition of the radiating particles as parameterized by lepton number @xmath111 .",
    "we expect that the details of the inhomogeneous model we have used are not unique , and that other inhomogeneous models could reproduce our observations just as well if they have the essential properties listed above .",
    "indeed , as discussed in  3.4.2 , any inhomogeneous model with smoothly varying magnetic field and particle densities is itself an idealization of the base of the jet which likely has local variations in these properties . in this respect , we see our detailed numerical results from  3.4.2 only as estimations of the physical properties of this feature .    finally , we reiterate that if an external faraday screen is responsible for rotating and depolarizing the linear polarization , a wider range of general magnetic field and particle models could produce the observed circular polarization .",
    "parsec - scale faraday rotation measure observations of 3c279 have been published by @xcite and @xcite spanning five epochs from early 1997 through mid-2001 .",
    "their results agree with ours in that they find consistently negative , but variable , faraday rotations in the core region of magnitudes encompassing those we see in components d , 5 , and 4 .",
    "the variable rotation measures they observe fit naturally into our model where the amount of poloidal magnetic field drops off sharply from the core region , and newly emerging components can sample a range of internal rotation measures as they propagate down the jet . however , an external screen , very close to the jet , could also have these properties . further out in the jet ,",
    "these authors find a strong jet component to have a small amount of negative faraday rotation at about 3 milli - arcseconds from the core in their 1997 and 1998 epochs ; however , by 2000 , this component shows a small amount of positive faraday rotation , less than @xmath345 rad / m@xmath168 in the observer s frame of reference .",
    "this shift to positive rotation measure could be related to a collision and re - alignment event this component underwent in mid-1998 @xcite , or the component could simply be far enough from the central engine that other external faraday screens between us and the source are playing the dominant role .",
    "rad / m@xmath168 for 3c279 which is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than even the smallest negative rotation measure we find here for component 4 , and thus correction for this integrated value would have essentially no impact on our results . ]",
    "this evidence indicates that the negative faraday rotation observed near the core region by ourselves and others is indeed produced local to the jet .",
    "it could be due to the fields internal to the jet , as we propose here .",
    "alternatively , it could be generated externally , but close to the jet , by fields and particle densities which scale with frequency and position in just the right way to produce both the approximately constant fractional linear polarization _ and _ offset evpa observed in component d at all frequencies .",
    "we regard the fact that linear polarization of this kind comes out naturally from the internal rotation model as strong evidence in favor of it .",
    "an interesting result from the integrated umrao monitoring of 3c279 at 4.8 , 8.0 , and 14.5 ghz is that 3c279 shows occasional sign reversals in its circular polarization at 4.8 ghz but not at higher frequencies ( * ? ? ? * and figure 5 ) .",
    "an important question is whether these sign reversals can be understood in the context of the model of the core region preferred for the vlba data . from figure",
    "[ f : speci ] it is clear that the core region flux at 4.8 ghz is dominated by components 5 and 4 .",
    "the faraday conversion models preferred for components 5 and 4 will naturally produce negative circular polarization at high optical depths , at a frequency about one - third of the spectral turnover @xcite . with spectral turnovers near 9.0 ghz , components 5 and 4 should not be producing negative circular polarization at 4.8 ghz in the vlba epoch investigated here , and indeed negative circular polarization is not observed near this epoch ; however , when these components were first originating near the base of the jet , they must have been more compact with higher turnover frequencies and may well have generated the negative circular polarization observed at 4.8 ghz in mid-2005 along with the increase in stokes @xmath0 at that time .",
    "strong negative circular polarization is also seen at 4.8 ghz at several other epochs during this period : early 2004 , mid-2004 , mid-2006 , late 2006 , and late 2007 .",
    "each of these events also appear to be linked with increases in stokes @xmath0 , suggesting that new components may be ejected from the base of the jet at these times .",
    "we have made multi - frequency , parsec scale observations of the core region of 3c279 in stokes @xmath0 , linear polarization , and circular polarization .",
    "the core region of 3c279 consists of three main components : two homogeneous components , 5 and 4 , and the inhomogeneous component d at the base of the jet , and we have modeled the full polarization spectra of these components with radiative transfer simulations to constrain the magnetic field and particle properties of the parsec - scale jet in 3c279 .    we find that the polarization properties of the core region , including the amount of linear polarization , the amount and sign of faraday rotation , and the amount and sign of circular polarization can be explained by a consistent physical model .",
    "the base of the jet , component d , is modeled as a conical inhomogeneous blandford - knigl style jet @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of this feature is dominated by vector - ordered poloidal magnetic field along the jet axis , and we estimated the net magnetic flux of this field .",
    "this poloidal field at the base of the jet produces intrinsic circular polarization and depolarizes and rotates the linear polarization . in the homogeneous components 5 and 4 , further down the jet , the magnetic field",
    "is dominated by local shocks , and a much smaller fraction of vector - ordered , poloidal field remains along the jet axis .",
    "this remaining vector - ordered field provides a consistent internal faraday rotation , which allows faraday conversion to generate the appropriate amount and spectra of circular polarization from these components .",
    "we note that this physical model is not unique if one allows the observed faraday rotation and depolarization to occur in screens external to the jet .",
    "such external screens would de - couple the linear and circular polarization and allow a wider range of physical parameters ; however , we find the fact that all of the essential polarization characteristics can be simultaneously produced by magnetic field and plasma properties internal to the jet itself to be compelling motivation for this model .    with this model",
    ", we can additionally constrain the particle properties of the jet .",
    "we find the jet to be kinetically dominated by protons with a lepton number @xmath346 corresponding to @xmath347 75% of the radiating particles being electrons , and therefore we can not rule out a significant admixture of positrons .",
    "based on the amounts of faraday conversion deduced for the homogeneous components 5 and 4 , we find a plausible range for the lower cutoff in the relativistic particle energy spectrum to be @xmath2 .",

    "* ) .          where @xmath352 and @xmath353 are the emission and absorption coefficients respectively for @xmath166 . for optically thin emission in a completely ordered magnetic field ,",
