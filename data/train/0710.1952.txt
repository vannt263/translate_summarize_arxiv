    "the question of neutrino mass is one of the most profound in modern particle physics .",
    "most plausible models of neutrino mass solve the puzzle of why neutrino masses are so small by introducing a new scale at high energy , and precision studies of neutrino physics therefore hold the potential to investigate physics at scales beyond those reachable in current accelerator experiments .",
    "they also make the study of the possible majorana nature of neutrinos possible ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion of this ) .",
    "while the neutrino mass differences have now been measured at about 10% precision by oscillation experiments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) the absolute mass scale remains unknown and inaccessible to oscillation experiments .",
    "there are , however , several possible paths to measuring the absolute neutrino mass .",
    "the kinematical effect of neutrino mass can be probed either via its effect on the beta decay spectrum or via its effect on cosmological structure formation . if neutrinos are majorana particles a different possibility is to search for neutrinoless double beta decay because the transition probability for this process is proportional to the neutrino mass squared .    in the past year",
    "there have been several papers discussing how to unify the data analysis for the various approaches @xcite .",
    "this is a non - trivial issue , given that completely different physics is involved and that the three probes are actually sensitive to three distinct observables .    here",
    "we present a new markov chain monte carlo global analysis of neutrino parameters using both cosmological and experimental data .",
    "the analysis software is based on the cosmomc markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package for cosmological parameter estimation @xcite , appropriately modified to incorporate all parameters related to neutrino physics .",
    "this approach uses bayesian inference instead of the frequentist method commonly used in particle physics .",
    "the approach is somewhat similar to the mcmc technique developed in @xcite to constrain mssm parameters .",
    "however , a key difference is that here we keep the full cosmological parameter estimation which allows for a closer study of the interplay between neutrino data and cosmological parameter estimation .    in section",
    "ii we describe the methodology used and in section iii we present the main results for various different assumptions about present and future data , as well as different parameter spaces .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section iv .",
    "the mcmc bayesian inference approach has been described in detail for instance in @xcite . based on assumed priors on each parameter",
    "it samples the likelihood function using the markov chain monte carlo method and from that the posterior credible intervals for all parameters can be calculated . before running the markov chains it is therefore necessary to specify both the parameters to be used and the priors on all parameters .    for the neutrino physics part we have used the mass of the lightest eigenstate @xmath0 ( @xmath1 for the normal hierachy , @xmath2 for the inverted hierarchy ) , the two mass differences @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the three mixing angles @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "we also assume that neutrinos are majorana particles so that there are two additional majorana phases @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which together with the mass differences and mixing angles specify the observables related to absolute neutrino mass ( assuming only active neutrinos ) . in total there are then 8 parameters related to the neutrino sector .",
    "there are three separate observables related to the three different types of probes .",
    "cosmology is only sensitive to the neutrino mass , and until the accuracy reaches the 0.05 ev level only to the sum of neutrino masses ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion of this ) @xmath10 in terms of the parameters used in cosmomc this corresponds to @xmath0 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these are therefore the only parameters which are regarded as `` slow '' in the sense that a change in one of them requires recalculation of the transfer function for cosmological perturbations .    at the projected level of accuracy of katrin",
    "the change in the electron energy spectrum can be described using a single effective mass parameter which is essentially the incoherent sum ( see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath13 the parameter actually measured in such experiments is in fact @xmath14 which , being a fit - parameter , can be positive or negative when measured .",
    "conversely , the effective mass measured in neutrinoless double beta decay is the coherent sum @xcite @xmath15 which allows for phase cancelation .",
    "the actual parameter measured in any neutrinoless double beta decay experiment is the half - life @xmath16 which is related to @xmath17 via the relation @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a phase - space factor and @xmath20 the nuclear matrix element squared . in principle",
    "the mcmc code should use the measured @xmath16 and the calculated matrix element ( both including uncertainties ) as parameters instead of @xmath21 .",
    "however , for simplicity we assume a gaussian error on @xmath21 with the estimated error on the matrix element from @xcite .",
    "in the following we have used cosmological parameters consistent with the `` vanilla '' @xmath22cdm model : @xmath23 , the physical baryon density , @xmath24 , the physical cdm density , @xmath25 , the amplitude of primordial fluctuations , @xmath26 the scalar spectral index , @xmath27 , the optical depth to reionization , and @xmath28 , the hubble parameter .",
    "spatial flatness has been assumed so that @xmath29 . in total",
    "there are then 6 parameters related to the cosmological model .    for the purpose of parameter estimation",
    "the publicly available cosmomc markov chain monte carlo has been modified to perform parameter estimation in this 14-dimensional parameter space .",
    "cosmomc has been set to use the fast / slow parameter scheme . in table",
    "[ table : priors ] we give the list of parameters as well as their priors .",
    "note that we also include the two parameters @xmath30 , the dark energy equation of state , and @xmath31 , the running of the scalar spectral index , both of which are discussed in section [ sec : extended ] .",

    "we note that this assumption can easily be changed in the code and replaced with the full likelihood calculation from experimental data .",
    "we use the same constraints as in @xcite , given by @xmath44 with all errors being @xmath45 .",
    "the assumption of gaussian errors does not significantly alter any of our results .",
    "based on the approach described in the previous section we have calculated the present bound on neutrino properties using various combinations of data sets from cosmology , tritium decay and neutrinoless double beta decay respectively .",
    "cosmological constraints on @xmath46 have been calculated by many different authors for various assumptions about parameters and using different data sets ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    here",
    "we present just one particular example , which is exactly the same as used in @xcite .",
    "we use the wmap cmb temperature and polarisation data @xcite , the sdss - lrg and 2df large scale structure data @xcite , the sdss - lrg baryon acoustic oscillation data @xcite , and the sni - a data set compiled in @xcite .",
    "details about the cosmological data can be found in @xcite .    using only the cosmological data we find a bound of @xmath47 ev for the minimal @xmath22cdm model .",
    "we note that this is slightly lower than the 0.6 ev found in @xcite for the same model and data .",
    "this is worth noticing because the prior on @xmath0 is logarithmic in the present study while it was linear in @xcite .",
    "a logarithmic prior on @xmath0 tends to favour small @xmath0 values because of the large parameter space volume at negative @xmath48 and therefore shifts the allowed region slightly down .",
    "this phenomenon is an integral part of bayesian inference because a prior probability distribution needs to be specified . in frequentist statistics",
    "this problem does not occur and the result does not depend on any priors . it should be noted that in the limit of gaussian statistics the two methods yield exactly the same result .",
    "the phenomenon has been recently been studied in the context of neutrino properties .",
    "for example it was shown in @xcite that bayesian inference and likelihood maximisation give very different results for cosmological parameters such as the radiation density as long as the likelihood function is non - gaussian . as more data is added and the likelihood function approaches a gaussian the two methods converge .",
    "the question of bayesian versus frequentist statistics was studied in @xcite in the context of katrin .",
    "for example the difference between a linear and a logarithmic prior on @xmath49 was investigated and found to have some ( not crucial ) effect . in conclusion",
    ", assumptions about priors will have an effect on the posterior distributions as long as the likelihood function is non - gaussian which is the case for parameters which are not extremely well constrained .",

    "more interestingly we have studied the interplay between various future constraints from cosmology , tritium decay and neutrinoless double beta decay . if all probes come up with a negative result the addition of data sets does not yield any radically new information .",
    "however , we have also studied an example in which the upcoming katrin and gerda experiments are both assumed to provide tentative evidence for neutrino mass . in this case",
    "the combination of all three types of data allows for a much stronger constraint on neutrino properties than otherwise allowed .",
    "finally we have also studied how experimental data from tritium decay or neutrinoless double beta decay can help in cosmological parameter estimation , particularly concerning the dark energy equation of state .",
    "it should be noted that in the present analysis only presently available cosmological data has been used . in the same time frame as katrin and gerda new cosmological data will become available and is likely to improve the cosmological neutrino mass bound significantly ( see @xcite for a non - exhaustive list ) . in the somewhat longer term cosmological constraints can be potentially be pushed below 0.1 ev sensitivity to @xmath46 . at the same time",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay experiments will have equally improved sensitivity and it will very likely be possible to determine the absolute neutrino mass as well as the nature of the mass hierarchy .    in conclusion , the combination of cosmological data with experimental neutrino data in a global analysis will be extremely useful in the future , when more precise experimental data becomes available .",
