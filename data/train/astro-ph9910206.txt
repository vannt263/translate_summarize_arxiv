    "ngc  5904=m5=*c1516 + 022 * is a rich globular cluster whose proximity and low reddening ( @xmath2  kpc , @xmath3 ; harris 1996 ) make it an excellent target for detailed studies .",
    "we selected this cluster as one of the targets for an ongoing survey for eclipsing binaries in globular clusters ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1997 ; thompson et al .",
    "the main goal of this project is to use detached eclipsing binaries for the determination of ages and distances of globular clusters ( paczyski 1997 ) .",
    "+ m5 is known to contain more than 120 rr lyr variables ( clement 1997 priv .",
    "ccd @xmath4 photometry for 49 of them was presented recently by reid ( 1996 ) who gives references to earlier papers dealing with rr lyr stars in m5 . as a side result of our survey",
    "we obtained @xmath5-band light curves for 65 rr  lyr stars from m5 .",
    "these data will be presented in a separate contribution ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "reid ( 1996 ) reported the discovery of 4 probable eclipsing binaries among the cluster hb / rgb stars .",
    "in addition , yan & reid ( 1996 ) identified 6 short - period eclipsing binaries located at the cluster turn - off .",
    "our data indicate that all of the eclipsing variables reported in reid ( 1996 ) and yan & reid ( 1996 ) were spurious detections .",
    "drissen & shara ( 1998 ) used hst images to look for variable stars in the core of m5 .",
    "they managed to identify one variable blue straggler , a possible eclipsing binary with a period @xmath6 d. several new rr lyr stars were also identified in this study .",
    "m5 is one of only two galactic globular clusters known to harbor dwarf novae .",
    "variable m5-v101 was first identified as a dwarf nova by oosterhoff ( 1941 ) .",
    "a recent summary of observational studies of that variable is given in hakala et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . during our monitoring of m5",
    "the variable exhibited two outbursts with full amplitudes exceeding 2.7 mag in the v band .",
    "the time - series photometry of m5 on which this paper is based was obtained with the 1.0-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the data were collected during the interval 1997 may 9  1997 aug 13 .",
    "a condensed log of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    ".observing log [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     all of the solutions in table 4 imply that the system is detached with the secondary eclipse being total or very close to total . based on a @xmath7 criterion ,",
    "the best solution was obtained for @xmath8 , but solutions derived for other values of @xmath9 are only marginally worse .",
    "this is not surprising considering the limited accuracy of the photometry and the detached configuration of the binary . to illustrate the quality of the solutions we plot in fig .",
    "8 the observed light curve with the synthetic light curve corresponding to @xmath8 . despite our inability to derive the mass ratio of the system it is safe to state that m5-nv5 is a detached binary with an inclination @xmath10 deg and that the luminosity ratio @xmath11 .",
    "the position of the primary component of m5-nv5 on the cluster cmd ( see fig .",
    "4 ) is consistent with the hypothesis that it is a main - sequence star belonging to the cluster .",
    "finally , we note that the derived values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 favor solutions with @xmath14 ( if we assume that both components are main sequence stars ) .",
    "if the system contains two cluster main sequence stars with masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 then the expected semi - amplitudes of their radial velocity curves are @xmath17 and @xmath18 km / sec . in this case",
    "the velocity curve of the binary would be relatively easily measured with a medium resolution spectrograph on a large telescope .    in a paper",
    "devoted mainly to a photometric analysis of rr lyr stars in m5 , reid ( 1996 ) reported the identification of 4 eclipsing binaries  2 located on the horizontal branch and 2 located on the giant branch .",
    "subsequently yan & reid ( 1996 ) used the same observational material to identify 6 short - period eclipsing binaries located on or near the main - sequence of the cluster .",
    "none of these 10 candidate variable stars was selected from our data base during our search for variable objects .",
    "our light curves for these stars do not show any sign of variability of the type reported by reid ( 1996 ) and yan & reid ( 1996 ) . at our request dr .",
    "reid checked his ccd frames of m5 .",
    "it turned out that the variability of the 4 candidate eclipsing binaries reported by reid ( 1996 ) was due to occasional passages of the stellar images through defective columns of the detector .",
    "our light curves for the 6 candidate variables reported by yan & reid ( 1996 ) show scatter ranging from 0.04 mag for v6 and v5 to 0.08 mag for v2 .",
    "none of these light curves show any modulation with the periods or at the amplitudes reported by yan & reid ( 1996 ) , nor with any other periods shorter than the time - base of our observations .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 9",
    "in which we show our light curves for stars v1 , v2 and v3 from yan & reid ( 1996 ) phased with the periods listed in that paper .",
    "m5-v101 is one of two cataclysmic variables which were known in globular clusters in the pre - hst era .",
    "it was discovered by oosterhoff ( 1941 ) , who suggested that it is a dwarf nova .",
    "that suggestion was later confirmed by spectroscopic as well as photometric observations ( margon et al .",
    "1981 ; shara et al .",
    "detection of the x - ray counterpart of m5-v101 was reported by hakala et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    in fig .",
    "10 we present the @xmath5-band light curve of m5-v101 based on our observations .",
    "the variable displayed two outbursts with full amplitudes of about 2.7 mag during our observations in 1997 .",
    "on the night of may 30 1998 we observed m5-v101 at @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( hjd = 245 0963.57 ) .",
    "the occurrence of at least two outbursts on a time scale of 100 days in 1997 as well as the detection by shara et al .",
    "( 1987 ) of a single outburst during a two - week long monitoring period indicates a relatively short duty cycle for m5-v101 .",
    "examination of the nightly light curves from the 1997 season reveals occasional variability with a full amplitude of about 0.4 mag on a characteristic time scale of about 3.4 hours .",
    "spectroscopic data presented by naylor et al .",
    "( 1989 ) suggest that the orbital period of m5-v101 is longer than 3.5 hours .",
    "an extensive and detailed photometric study of m5 based on ccd bvi data was published by sandquist et al .",
    "even more recently johnson & bolte ( 1998 ) reported vi data for a field in the outer part of the cluster .",
    "as a by product of our program we obtained a medium - deep @xmath1 cmd for the @xmath0 arcmin field centered on the cluster , shown in fig .",
    "this cmd is based on the following set of images : @xmath21  60  s , 150  s , 260  s ; v ",
    "60  s , @xmath22  s. the observations were obtained on the nights of 1998 may 30 and june 3 .",
    "the seeing for these frames ranged from 1.13 to 1.35 arcsec .",
    "photometry was extracted using daophot / allstar package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "measurements of stars with relatively poor quality ( large sigma for a given magnitude and/or a large value of stetson s chi parameter ) were rejected from the analysis .",
    "known variables listed in clement ( 1997 , priv . comm . ) or in sandquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are not plotted in fig .",
    "the cmd shows several features discussed in some detail by sandquist et al .",
    "in particular we note the presence of a star lying to the blue of the hb at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this star is located at angular distance @xmath25 arcmin from the projected cluster center .",
    "this does not exclude its cluster membership but clearly additional data are needed to clarify this point .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of this star are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the cmd also includes a faint blue star with @xmath5 = 18.836 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is located about 2 magnitudes below the cutoff of the blue horizontal branch of the cluster .",
    "this star is marked with the triangle in fig .",
    "its equatorial coordinates are : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is a good candidate for an extreme horizontal branch star .",
    "the light curve of this star shows no evidence for variability with a full amplitude exceeding 0.02 mag .",
    "the most interesting result of this paper is the identification of a detached eclipsing binary which is most probably composed of two upper main sequence stars from m5 .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic follow up observations of this star are planned by our group .",
    "our data indicate that 10 candidate eclipsing binaries reported by reid ( 1996 ) and yan & reid ( 1996 ) do not show any periodic variability on time scales shorter than about a week .",
    "four sx phe stars were identified , all located among the blue stragglers on the cluster cmd . assuming cluster membership , their absolute magnitudes @xmath31 are 0.2 - 0.3 mag too bright in comparison with the standard relations obtained by mcnamara ( 1997 , 1995 ) .",
    "two outbursts of the dwarf nova m5-v101 were detected during the period may - aug 1997 .",
    "a faint blue object , which we propose is an extreme horizontal branch star from m5 , was identified .",
