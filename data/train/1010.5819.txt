    "the emerging census of extrasolar planets has revealed an abundance of exoplanets , ranging from super - earths to super - jupiters .",
    "mayor et al . ( 2009 ) suggest that @xmath4 30% of solar - type stars have short period ( less than 100 days ) super - earths with masses less than 30 @xmath5 . the estimated frequency of giant planets with masses in the range from 0.3 to 10 @xmath6 ( jupiter - masses ) inside @xmath7 au is @xmath4 10% to @xmath4 20% ( cumming et al .",
    "gravitational microlensing detections imply an even higher frequency of giant planets orbiting beyond 3 au , about 35% ( gould et al .",
    "giant planet formation thus appears to be a reasonably common outcome of the low - mass star formation process .    while core accretion continues to be the most popular mechanism for giant planet formation ( e.g. , johnson et al .",
    "2010 ) , disk instability seems to be necessary as well , at least in order to explain the formation of gas giant planets orbiting at great distances .",
    "hr 8799 , e.g. , appears to have a system of three giant planets , orbiting at distances of 24 , 38 , and 68 au , with masses of 10 , 10 , and 7 @xmath6 , respectively ( marois et al .",
    "core accretion appears to be unable to form gas giants beyond @xmath4 35 au even in the most favorable circumstances ( e.g. , levison & stewart 2001 ; thommes , duncan , & levison 2002 ; chambers 2006 ) , and gravitational scattering outward of planets formed closer in does not seem to lead to stable wide orbits ( dodson - robinson et al .",
    "2009 ; raymond , armitage , & gorelick 2010 ) .",
    "disk instability appears to be the more likely mechanism for forming wide gas giant planets ( boss 2003 , 2010 ; dodson - robinson et al .",
    "2009 ; boley 2009 ) , while its utility for forming planets much closer in continues to be debated ( e.g. , boss 2009 ) .    at a minimum ,",
    "the disk instability mechanism require two conditions to be met in order to produce giant planets : a disk sufficiently massive and cold enough to be gravitationally unstable , and the ability to radiate away enough energy produced by compressional heating to allow any clumps that form to contract toward planetary densities ( e.g. , helled , podolak , & kovetz 2006 ; helled & bodenheimer 2010 ) .",
    "the latter question has been a particular focus of study , with much effort devoted to simplified models where disk cooling occurs over a timescale @xmath8 .",
    "gammie ( 2001 ) found that fragmentation should occur in two dimensional ( razor - thin ) disks with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the disk s angular frequency .",
    "rice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that @xmath12 led to fragmentation in their three dimensional disk simulations .",
    "boss ( 2004 ) estimated that @xmath13 characterized his three dimensional disk instability models with radiative transfer that resulted in clump formation .",
    "more recently , meru & bate ( 2010 ) have performed a detailed study of the effects of @xmath14 on disk models with varied surface density and temperature profiles , disk masses and radii , and stellar masses , finding that a single critical value of @xmath15 is not always able to predict whether or not fragmentation occurs . in a similar vein",
    ", a recent analysis by nero & bjorkman ( 2009 ) found that their analytical cooling time estimates were over an order of magnitude shorter than those calculated by rafikov ( 2005 ) , and hence considerably more supportive of fragmentation .",
    "a similar conclusion was found by boss ( 2005 ) .    here",
    "we completely avoid the debate over @xmath15 by directly calculating disk cooling through the inclusion of radiative transfer .",
    "we then use this brute force approach to attack the other pre - condition for a disk instability leading to fragmentation , namely the disk mass .",
    "recent observations of low- and intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars imply that their disks form with masses in the range from 0.05 @xmath16 to 0.4 @xmath16 ( isella , carpenter , & sargent 2009 ) .",
    "these observed disk masses form one of the primary constraints on disk instability models .",
    "previous disk instability models by boss ( 2002 ) for solar - mass protostars assumed disk masses of 0.091 @xmath16 from 4 to 20 au , while those by mayer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) had disk masses ranging from 0.075 to 0.125 @xmath16 inside 20 au .",
    "we present new results here for even lower mass protoplanetary disks ( 0.043 @xmath16 ) , to learn if the disk instability mechanism for giant planet formation can continue to operate in such a low mass disk around a solar - mass protostar .",
    "the calculations were performed with a numerical code that solves the three dimensional equations of hydrodynamics , including the energy equation , along with radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation and poisson s equation for the gravitational potential .",
    "compressional heating and radiative cooling are thus included .",
    "the same basic code has been used in all of the author s previous studies of disk instability .",
    "the code is second - order - accurate in both space and time .",
    "a complete description of the code and of the numerous tests it passed during its development may be found in boss & myhill ( 1992 ) .",
    "more recently , the radiative transfer solution technique has been shown to be highly accurate in relaxing to , and maintaining , analytical solutions for the temperature and radiative flux profiles for both spheres and disks of gas ( boss 2009 ) .",
    "both the jeans length ( e.g. , boss et al . 2000 ) and the toomre length ( nelson 2006 ) criteria are monitored throughout the runs to ensure that any clumps that might form are not numerical artifacts .",
    "the disks initially have the density distribution ( boss 1993 ) of an adiabatic , self - gravitating , thick disk in near - keplerian rotation about a stellar mass @xmath17    @xmath18,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath21 is the midplane density , and @xmath22 is the surface density .",
    "the adiabatic constant is @xmath23 ( cgs units ) and @xmath24 for the initial model ; thereafter , the disk evolves in a nonisothermal manner governed by the energy equation and radiative transfer ( boss & myhill 1992 ) .",
    "the radial variation of the initial midplane density is a power law that ensures near - keplerian rotation throughout the disk : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 g @xmath27 , and @xmath28 au .",
    "the surface density used to define the density distribution is : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 g @xmath31 . the use of this analytical surface density in the above density distribution results in an initial disk surface density distribution with @xmath32 to @xmath33 in the inner disk , steepening to @xmath34 in the outer disk ( boss 2002 ) .",
    "regions where the disk density falls to small values are considered to be in the infalling envelope with a density @xmath35 , where @xmath36 g @xmath27 . with @xmath37 ,",
    "the disk mass is @xmath38 from 4 to 20 au , a mass roughly half that of the otherwise identical disk models in boss ( 2002 ) .",
    "four different models have been computed with the above disk density distribution and with different combinations of outer disk temperature @xmath39 ( 20 and 25 k ) and envelope temperature @xmath40 ( 30 and 50 k ) .",
    "model a had @xmath39 = 20 k and @xmath40 = 50 k , model b had @xmath39 = 25 k and @xmath40 = 50 k , model c had @xmath39 = 20 k and @xmath40 = 30 k , and model d had @xmath39 = 25 k and @xmath40 = 30 k. the initial disk temperatures inside 7 au are those computed by boss ( 1996 ) for this disk density distribution , yielding a midplane temperature of @xmath41 = 339 k at 4 au and decreasing monotonically to @xmath41 = 100 k at 7 au ; thereafter , @xmath41 is assumed to decrease smoothly to @xmath2 = 20 or 25 k. [ in order to err on the side of stability , the temperature is not allowed to drop below this initial distribution . ]",
    "these choices lead to initial toomre ( 1964 ) @xmath42 gravitational stability criteria decreasing monotonically outwards from values greater than 10 inside 5 au to minimum @xmath42 values @xmath43 = 1.74 for models a and c and 1.95 for models b and d at the outer grid boundary of 20 au .",
    "higher initial @xmath42 values are expected to stifle disk fragmentation , so models b and d are intended to test the robustness of any fragmentation obtained in models a and c.",
    "all four models were run initially with @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( effectively ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for about 100 yr of evolution . during this time period ,",
    "all four models evolved in a similar manner , forming multiple trailing spiral arms that interacted with each other .",
    "the spiral arms formed throughout the disks , but were most pronounced inside @xmath4 10 au . in models",
    "a and c , the spiral arm interactions would occasionally lead to the formation of transient clumps .",
    "however , analysis of these clumps did not reveal any that were massive enough to be considered self - gravitating and hence candidates for possible giant planet formation . in models",
    "b and d , the spiral arms that formed were not as vigorous as those in models a and c , as expected given their slightly higher initial outer disk temperatures , and again self - gravitating clumps did not occur .",
    "after this initial phase of evolution , all four models were doubled in their @xmath48 grid resolution and run further with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , effectively quadrupling the computational load by doubling the number of grid points while halving the time step . in order to maintain numerical stability for the energy equation solution ,",
    "the time steps used were always small fractions of the maximum permissible explicit time differencing time step ( @xmath51 ) , often as small as 0.01 @xmath51 .",
    "this resulted in painfully slow execution of the models , each of which required approximately three years of continuous processing on a dedicated carnegie alpha cluster node .",
    "figure 1 shows the equatorial density distribution of model a after 129 yr of evolution .",
    "strong spiral arms are apparent from the inner boundary at 4 au out to @xmath4 10 au , as well as a number of clumps , often still aligned with their parental spiral arms .",
    "figure 2 depicts the midplane temperature distribution , which rises rapidly inside @xmath4 7 au to a maximum of @xmath4 340 k at 4 au .",
    "comparison of figures 1 and 2 shows that the clumps form in the region most advantageous for their formation : just outside @xmath4 7 au , where the disk midplane temperatures begin to moderate , yet as close to the center as possible , where the orbital periods are shortest , as expected for a dynamical instability linked to the rotation period .    for model",
    "a at 129 yr , the maximum midplane density of @xmath52 g @xmath27 occurs for the clump seen at about 6 oclock in figure 1 .",
    "figure 3 presents the midplane density and temperature as a function of disk radius for an azimuthal profile that passes through the clump at @xmath4 6 oclock in figure 1 .",
    "figure 3 shows that the maximum density occurs at a radius of @xmath4 8 au , just at the radius where the temperature profile begins to rise rapidly inward .",
    "the mass of the clump at this time is @xmath53 , slightly above the jeans mass of @xmath54 at the mean density ( @xmath55 g @xmath27 ) and mean temperature ( 26 k ) of the clump .",
    "this mass estimate implies that the clump is self - gravitating and could be expected to contract to higher densities if permitted by the spatial resolution of the grid . at the radial distance of the model a clump ( 7 au ) , @xmath42 has dropped from an initial value of 2.7 to 1.9 , allowing marginal clump formation .",
    "the tidal radius for the clump is 0.34 au , similar to the radial half - extent of the clump seen in figure 3 .",
    "note from figure 3 that at this early phase , the clump has not begun to undergo any significant self - heating due to contraction .",
    "upward convective - like motions are present in model a , but their vigor may not be sufficient to permit cooling on an orbital timescale , compared to disk models with twice the disk mass , i.e. , model hr of boss ( 2004 ) . boss ( 2004 )",
    "estimated an effective global value of @xmath13 for model hr ; the reduced convective - like motions in model a imply a value of @xmath56 .",
    "the clump orbits on a trajectory equivalent to a keplerian orbit with a semimajor axis of 7.3 au and an eccentricity of 0.05 .",
    "the 6 oclock clump shown in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 first appeared roughly 1/4 of an orbital rotation earlier , and persists for another @xmath4 1/2 orbital rotation before the calculation was ended after a total of 143 yr of evolution ( 143 yr equals @xmath4 19 inner orbital rotation periods , as the disk s orbital rotation period is 7.7 yr at 4 au ) . at that final time , the estimated clump mass had increased slightly to @xmath57 , again above the jeans mass of @xmath58 at the mean density ( @xmath59 g @xmath27 ) and the slightly higher mean temperature ( 30 k ) of the clump .",
    "this suggests that a protoplanet with an initial mass of at least @xmath57 should form from this clump .",
    "the clump s orbital eccentricity has increased to 0.09 by this time , while its semimajor axis has decreased to 6.8 au .",
    "a second distinct clump seen at about 10 oclock in figure 1 is not likely to form a protoplanet , however . at a time of 129 yr , the clump s estimated mass is @xmath60 , well below its jeans mass of @xmath61 at this mean density ( @xmath62 g @xmath27 ) and mean temperature ( 46 k ) .",
    "the other clumps evident in figure 1 suffer from the same fate of not being massive enough to be self - gravitating .",
    "hence model a seems able to lead to only a single giant protoplanet .",
    "figure 4 and 5 present the midplane densities and temperatures for model b after 119 yr of evolution .",
    "figures 4 and 5 are similar to figures 1 and 2 , although the spiral arms are not quite as robust in model b as in model a , as seen in either the density distributions of figures 1 and 4 or the temperature distributions of figures 2 and 5 .",
    "the most promising clump in model b at 119 yr occurs at 5 oclock in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the estimated clump mass is @xmath63 , below the jeans mass of @xmath57 at the mean density ( @xmath64 g @xmath27 ) and mean temperature ( 40 k ) of the clump .",
    "the clump at 7 oclock in figures 4 and 5 suffers from the same problem ; model b appears to be close to , but not quite capable of forming self - gravitating clumps .",
    "models c and d are identical to models a and b except for having envelope temperatures of 30 k instead of 50 k. while the envelope temperature has some effect on the outcome of the evolutions , after 137 yr model c was only able to form a single self - gravitating clump with a mass of @xmath65 and another clump that did not exceed the jeans mass , as was the case for model a. similar to model b , model d was unable to form a single self - gravitating clump after 113 yr of evolution .",
    "the four models clearly show that low mass disks orbiting solar - mass protostars are less able to form self - gravitating clumps that might go on to form giant protoplanets than more massive disks .",
    "boss ( 2002 ) presented a suite of solar - mass protostar models with disk masses of @xmath66 that are otherwise much the same as the present models , with the exception of starting their evolutions with outer disk temperatures ranging from 20 k to 50 k , resulting in initial minimum toomre @xmath42 values ranging from 0.94 to 1.5 .",
    "all of these boss ( 2002 ) disk models formed multiple self - gravitating clumps ( see , e.g. , figure 3 of boss 2002 ) .",
    "the present models thus suggest that the ability of disk instability to form self - gravitating clumps is severely compromised as the disk mass is lowered to @xmath3 .",
    "the results are consistent with those obtained by mayer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who studied disks extending from 4 to 20 au in orbit around a solar - mass protostar using an sph code with diffusion approximation radiative transfer .",
    "mayer et al . (",
    "2007 ) found that when the disk mass was taken to be @xmath67 , the toomre @xmath42 was below 2 in the outer disk and strong spiral arms appeared .",
    "however , fragmentation occurred in some of their models only when the disk mass was increased to @xmath68 , with fragmentation depending on their choice of the mean molecular weight of the disk gas and of the ability to cool from the surface of the disk . given that the mayer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) disks were assumed to have outer disk temperatures of 40 k , considerably warmer than the values of 20 k and 25 k studied here , the requirement of a disk mass higher than @xmath67 for fragmentation to occur in their models is consistent with the present models , as well as with those of boss ( 2002 ) , where fragmentation occurred in similar models with disk masses of @xmath66 and outer disk temperatures as high as 50 k.    while envelope temperatures of 30 to 50 k appear to reasonable bounds for a solar - mass protostar during quiescent periods ( chick & cassen 1997 ) , the primary question arising from these four models is what is the proper outer disk temperature ? is @xmath69 20 k or 25 k beyond @xmath4 7 au a realistic assumption ?",
    "dalessio et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented t tauri disk models with midplane temperatures of @xmath4 30 to 40 k at 10 au , depending on the dust grain population .",
    "observations of the dm tau outer disk , on scales though of 50 to 60 au , imply midplane temperatures of 13 to 20 k ( dartois , dutrey , & guilloteau 2003 ) .",
    "observations of cometary ices imply disk temperatures of @xmath4 28 k at their formation locations ( kawakita et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the composition of the giant planets suggests that solids formed at 5.2 au and beyond at temperatures of no more than 30 to 40 k ( owens & encrenaz 2006 ) .",
    "the present models suggest that outer disk temperatures must be as low as @xmath4 20 k in order for disk instability to have a chance to form giant protoplanets in these relatively low mass disks , and it is unclear at present if such low outer disk temperatures are realistic or not .",
    "boss ( 2002 ) found that robust disk instablities could occur inside 20 au in disks with a mass of @xmath70 .",
    "the present models show that when the disk mass inside 20 au is halved , the ability of disk instability to produce viable , self - gravitating clumps is signficantly compromised , when self - consistently - calculated disk cooling rates are employed . disk instability thus appears to be only a marginally effective process in a disk with @xmath71 , and is unlikely to lead to giant planet formation around solar - mass protostars with disks significantly less massive than @xmath71 . clearly core accretion remains as the favored formation mechanism for giant planets in such lower mass disks .",
