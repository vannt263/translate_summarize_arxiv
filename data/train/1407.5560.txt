    "the calculation of acoustic scattering by extended rough surfaces remains a challenging problem both theoretically and computationally ( e.g. @xcite ) especially in the presence of strong multiple scattering .",
    "this becomes acute at low grazing angles , where multiple scattering occurs for very slight roughness .",
    "boundary integral methods are flexible and often used for such problems but can be computationally intensive and scale badly with increasing wavenumber .",
    "much effort has therefore been devoted to this aspect , where possible exploiting properties of the scattering regime . for forward scattering in 2-dimensions , for example , provided roughness length - scales are large , the ` parabolic integral equation method ' can be applied @xcite . for electromagnetic problems ,",
    "also formulated using boundary integrals , the methods of ordered multiple interactions and left - right splitting in both 2-d and 3-d ( @xcite-@xcite ) have been developed : here the scattered field is expressed as an iterative series of terms of increasing orders of multiple scattering , as described below .",
    "approaches using conjugate gradient solutions combined with fast multilevel multipole are also receiving much attention . an important exception which overcomes the dependence of computational expense on wavenumber is @xcite , which has been applied to surfaces with piecewise constant impedance data or scattering in 2-d by convex polygons . a versatile recursive technique known as multiple sweep method of moments",
    "was developed and analysed in @xcite where it was compared with method of ordered multiple interactions .",
    "this technique was shown to tackle ` composite ' problems for which the above method diverges such as for a ship on a rough sea surface .",
    "other iterative solutions have been studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition theoretical results are available in various limiting regimes ( e.g. perturbation theory for small surface heights , @xmath0 including periodic surfaces @xcite , kirchhoff approximation @xcite , or the small slope approximation @xcite which is accurate over a wider range of scattering angles than both of these ) . for arbitrary finite rough surfaces , however , validation is more difficult , and such results are therefore scarce .    in this paper",
    "the left - right splitting method is developed and applied to the problem of acoustic scattering in three dimensions by randomly rough surfaces .",
    "for relatively small surfaces the results are validated by comparison with numerical solution of the full boundary integral equation .",
    "the principal aims are to validate the approach ; to examine its robustness and convergence as the angle of incidence changes ; and to consider further approximations which may reduce the computation time .",
    "the approach is applicable to a wide range of interior and exterior scattering problems , and we give examples for acoustic propagation in a varying duct , in addition to scattering from large rough surfaces .",
    "the mathematical principles of the method are the same as for the two - dimensional problem @xcite although implementation is considerably more complicated : the unknown field @xmath1 on the surface is expressed as the solution to the helmholtz integral equation , with the integration taken over the rough surface .",
    "this may be written formally as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the incident field impinging ( say ) from the left , so that we require @xmath4 .",
    "the region of integration is split into two , to the left and right of the point of observation , allowing @xmath5 to be written as the sum of ` left ' and ` right ' components , say @xmath6 . roughly speaking @xmath7 represents surface interactions due to scattering from the left , and @xmath8 the residual scattering from the right .",
    "the inverse of @xmath5 can formally be expressed as a series a^-1= l^-1 - l^-1 r l^-1 + ... [ eq1 ] discretization of the integral equation yields a block matrix equation , in which @xmath7 is the lower triangular part of the block matrix @xmath5 ( including the diagonal ) and @xmath8 is the upper triangular part . under the assumption",
    "that most energy is right - going , @xmath7 is the dominant part of @xmath5 , and the series can be truncated to provide an approximation for @xmath9 .",
    "this approach has several advantages . in terms of wavelength @xmath10 ,",
    "evaluation of each term scales with the fourth rather than the sixth power of @xmath10 required for @xmath11 ; subsequent terms ( of which typically only the first one or two are needed ) have the same computational cost . with further approximations",
    "this can be reduced to @xmath12 . however , this operation count is only part of the story , because the low complexity and memory requirement allow very large problems to be tackled without such additional approximation .",
    "in addition the algorithm lends itself well to parallelisation , and the speed scales approximately linearly with the number of processors .    in  2 the governing equations and left - right splitting approximation are formulated .",
    "the numerical details and main results are shown in  3 .",
    "consider a 3-dimensional medium with horizontal axes @xmath13 and vertical axis @xmath14 directed upwards , and let @xmath15 be the wavenumber .",
    "let @xmath16 be a 2-dimensional rough surface , varying about the plane @xmath17 , which is continuous and differentiable as a function of @xmath18 ( see figure [ example ] ) .",
    "( arbitrary scatterers can also be treated by the methods shown here ; examples will be given later . )",
    "consider a time - harmonic acoustic wave @xmath1 , obeying the wave equation @xmath19 in the region @xmath20 , resulting from an incident wave @xmath21 at a small grazing angle @xmath22 to the horizontal plane .",
    "this may for example be a plane wave or a finite beam .",
    "the axes can be chosen so that the principal direction of propagation is at a small angle to the @xmath23 plane . 1 true cm    3 true cm   example rough surface , title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    we will treat the neumann boundary condition , i.e. an acoustically hard surface .",
    "the derivation for the dirichlet condition is similar .",
    "thus    = 0 where @xmath24 is the outward normal ( i.e. directed out of the region @xmath20 ) .",
    "the free space green s function is given by g(, ) = e^ik|-|4|-| .",
    "[ ( 5.1 ) ] the field at a point @xmath25 in the medium is related to the surface field by the boundary integral _ inc ( ) = ( ) - _ s g(,)n (  ) d [ eq4 ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , say , and taking the limit as @xmath28 gives _",
    "inc(_s ) = ( _ s ) - _ s g(_s,)n (  ) d [ eq5 ] where now @xmath29 .",

    "the method of solution is analogous to that applied to the electromagnetic problem in 2-d or 3-d @xcite .",
    "the governing integral equation ( [ eq6 ] ) is expressed in terms of right- and left - going operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to the @xmath32-direction :    _ inc ( _ s ) = a ( l+r ) [ eq8 ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined ( for an @xmath35 function @xmath36 ) by @xmath37 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "[ for notational conveneince @xmath7 is interpreted to include the contribution from the singularity arising in ( [ eq5 ] ) when @xmath38 . ]",
    "the region of integration is thus split into two with respect to @xmath32 , and the solution of equation ( [ eq8 ] ) can be expanded as a series , given by    = ( l+r)^-1 _ inc = _ inc .",
    "[ series ] the key observation is that at fairly low grazing angles the effect of @xmath39 is in some sense small , so that the series converges quickly and can be truncated .",
    "define the @xmath40-th order approximation as _",
    "n=_1^n   l^-1 ( r l^-1)^n-1   . [ note that @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on surface geometry and wavenumber only , not on incident field ; and that one might expect convergence of the series ( [ series ] ) for given @xmath21 but not uniform ( norm ) convergence of the series ( [ eq1 ] ) . ]",
    "this corresponds physically to an assumption that surface - surface interactions are dominated by those ` from the left ' , as expected in this scattering regime .",
    "@xmath7 is large compared with @xmath8 first , because @xmath7 includes the dominant ` diagonal ' value ; second because a predominantly right - going wave gives rise to more rapid phase - variation in the integrand in @xmath8 than in @xmath7 .",
    "( although this depends on surface geometry and can not in general be quantified precisely , it occurs because in ( [ eq5 ] ) the phase in the green s function kernel decreases as the observation point is approached from the left and then increases to the right ; whereas the phase of @xmath1 tends to increase throughout , like that of the incident field . )",
    "this is borne out numerically , with many cases of interest well - described using only one or two terms of the series .",
    "the scattered field due to a given approximation @xmath41 is obtained by substitution back into the boundary integral ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "it is helpful to consider the significance of successive approximations to this field in the ray - theoretic limit : the first iteration contains ray paths which , before leaving the surface , may have interacted with the surface arbitrarily many times but only in a forward direction .",
    "the second includes most paths which have changed direction twice : once via the operator @xmath8 and again via @xmath42 ; and so on ( see figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "thus the first iteration accounts for multiple scattering but not _",
    "reversible _ paths which can occur when incident and backscatter direction are opposite ; these paths occur in pairs of equal length and therefore add coherently , giving rise to a peak in the backscattered direction ( enhanced backscatter eg @xcite ) in strongly scattering regimes .",
    "we would therefore expect this to show initially at the second approximation .",
    "1 true cm     possible paths ( a ) at 1st iteration , and ( b ) at 2nd iteration when reversible paths can occur and add coherently.,height=113 ]    having obtained this series , numerical treatment by surface discretization is straightforward .",
    "( discretization can equivalently be carried out before the series expansion , but it is more convenient , and analytically more transparent , to expand the integral operator first . )",
    "although use of the series ( [ series ] ) is motivated by physical considerations and its terms provide a convenient theoretical interpretation , the immediate advantage is computational : if the surface is discretized using a rectangular grid of @xmath43 by @xmath44 points , with @xmath43 transverse steps ( @xmath33 direction ) and @xmath44 in range ( @xmath32 ) , then @xmath45 becomes an @xmath46 matrix , and exact inversion would take @xmath47 operations . on the other hand evaluation of each term of eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) involves inversion of an @xmath48 matrix at each of @xmath44 range steps , requiring just @xmath49 operations and far less memory . assuming a resolution of say 10 points per wavelength , this scales with @xmath50 .",
    "there is an additional ` matrix filling ' component ; this also increases with @xmath50 , and in practice this is the dominant computational cost in the left - right splitting algorithm ( typically more than 90% when @xmath51 )",
    ".      the numerical treatment will now be outlined .",
    "the notation @xmath7 , @xmath8 will be used to refer to the discretized forms of the integral operators where no confusion arises , and we will focus on solution of the first term of ( [ series ] ) , i.e. inversion of @xmath7 . although not evaluated explicitly as such , the matrix @xmath7 is conveniently viewed as an @xmath52 lower - triangular block matrix whose entries are @xmath48 matrices .",
    "the system can therefore be inverted by gaussian elimination and back - substitution .",
    "this is an @xmath44-step ` marching ' process , in which each diagonal @xmath48 block is inverted in turn , corresponding to marching the solution for the unknown surface field in the positive @xmath32 direction .",
