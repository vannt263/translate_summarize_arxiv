    "neutrinos oscillation is one of most mysterious phenomena in particle physics , which reveals that neutrinos are massive and mixing structure of them are nontrivial .",
    "however , how to interpret the origin of masses and special mixing pattern of neutrinos is still an open question . as useful phenomenological scenarios , special textures of lepton mass matrices and corresponding flavor groups",
    "are introduced to predict mixing parameters of neutrinos . in particular , lepton mass matrices with texture zeros @xcite or structures alike @xcite are widely employed in mixing models of neutrinos , which can be realized in abelian or non - abelian flavor groups , see refs @xcite for example . as an important progress",
    ", the recent ref@xcite has performed a complete survey of possible combinations of texture zeros in mass matrices of charged leptons and majorana or dirac neutrinos .",
    "there are so many types of possible mass matrices with texture zeros that we do nt know what is the true texture chosen by nature . in order to evaluate importance of classes of texture zeros ,",
    "we propose two criteria : first , the mass matrices with texture zeros should be as economical as possible ; second , predictions of texture - zeros models should be stable under perturbations of mass matrices .",
    "we consider that an economical model of texture zeros can give clear dependences of observables on parameters of lepton mass matrices . and",
    "texture - zeros models with robust predictions are more sustainable , because they can react to the progress of neutrinos experiments by introduction small modifications or perturbations .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a special combination of texture zeros of leptons mass matrices with an economical and stable structure .",
    "the mass matrix of charged leptons is hermitian with fritzsch texture @xcite , i.e. , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is real and @xmath2 , @xmath3 are complex parameters . and the mass matrix of majorana neutrinos with one zero , i.e. , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is complex and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are real parameters . as for @xmath8 , because of its special structure , resorting to a diagonal phase matrix , it can be transformed to a real symmetric matrix with three parameters determined by masses of charged leptons .",
    "so it can be diagonalized by a matrix with a simple analytical expression . as for @xmath9 , it is magic , which predicts a trimaximal mixing pattern ( tm@xmath10 )  @xcite if the mass matrix of charged leptons is diagonal .",
    "the structure of @xmath9 is characterised by the ratio @xmath11 .",
    "so it can be diagonalized by a matrix with one real parameter . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath5 is a real parameter , @xmath9 would be more economical .",
    "however , in this case , ranges of mixing parameters would be smaller .",
    "so we introduce @xmath5 as a complex parameter in this paper .    in following sections , the analytical expression of the lepton mixing matrix",
    "numerical predictions of the mixing parameters are obtained by scanning parameter space of mass matrices .",
    "stabilities of these predictions are examined by introduction of random perturbations that break texture zeros of lepton mass matrices .",
    "finally , a summary is presented .",
    "in this section , we consider the analytical expression of mixing matrix and dependence of observables on parameters in lepton mass matrices .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix with the standard parametrization is expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are unphysical phases , @xmath14 are majorana phases , @xmath15 is written as  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the dirac cp - violating phase .",
    "this standard mixing matrix can be obtained through @xmath20 , where @xmath21 in our model comes from diagonalization of the hermitian mass matrix @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath22 @xmath23 comes from diagonalization of mass matrix of majorana neutrinos , i.e. @xmath24 in detail , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 where @xmath27+arg[b_{l}]$ ] , @xmath28 $ ] , elements of @xmath29 are written as  @xcite @xmath30^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath31^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath32^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath33^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath34^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath35^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath36^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath37^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath38^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "because mass hierarchy of charged leptons is strong , approximation of @xmath29 is @xmath41 furthermore , mass parameters of @xmath8 could also be expressed with masses of charged leptons , i. e. ,  @xcite @xmath42^{1/2},\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath43    as for neutrinos , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are normalization factors expressed as @xmath50^{-1 } , \\\\    n_{3\\nu}=[\\sqrt{1+(-1+x_{\\nu}+\\sqrt{1-x_{\\nu}+x^{2}_{\\nu}})^{2}+(x_{\\nu}-\\sqrt{1-x_{\\nu}+x^{2}_{\\nu}})^{2 } } ] ^{-1}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] and the diagonal phase matrix @xmath51 is expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "employing expressions of @xmath29 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath51 listed above , elements of the lepton mixing matrix can be written as @xmath58 obviously , @xmath59 are just relevant to majorana phases of the mixing matrix .",
    "the mixing angles of leptons can be obtained from comparison of expression of @xmath60 in eq .",
    "[ eq:15 ] with the form of @xmath61 in the standard parametrization in eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq:4 ] . in detail , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 because @xmath29 is dependent on masses of charged leptons that are determined by experiments very well , @xmath62 in fact is dependent on three real effective mass parameter : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . the same observation can also hold for @xmath67 , @xmath62 and @xmath19 . therefore , three mixing angles and dirac cp violating phase are not independent to each .    as for masses of neutrinos ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath68 they are dependent on four real parameters of @xmath9 . and",
    "the effective mass of neutrinoless double - beta decay , i.e. , @xmath69 is dependent on all 6 real parameters in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we take masses of charged leptons from particle data group  @xcite : @xmath70 then using the mixing - parameters - tools package  @xcite , we scan 6 real parameters in lepton mass matrices , i.e. , arg[@xmath2 ] , arg[@xmath3 ] , arg@xmath73 $ ] , @xmath74 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
