    "in typical inflationary scenarios of the early universe , after the many e - folds of inflation necessary to solve the horizon and homogeneity problems , the matter and radiation energy density had been red - shifted to almost zero . however , once inflation has ended , this scenario has to merge with the standard big bang , radiation dominated cosmology .",
    "the succesful intertwining of inflation with the standard big bang cosmology thus necessitates some source of energy and entropy to rethermalize , or reheat the universe@xcite .",
    "models that reheat to temperatures above the gut scale would have to cope with the monopole and domain wall and inhomogeneity problems associated with the breakdown of their symmetries .",
    "however there is a fundamental scale for a reheating temperature : nucleosynthesis , this requires reheating temperatures in excess of 10 - 100 mev . if baryogenesis can occur at the electroweak scale then it would be imperative to have reheating temperatures larger than say a few hundred gev ( a baryon over antibaryon excess may be wiped out if this occurs during the fast inflationary era ) .",
    "therefore , nucleosynthesis and particle physics restrict the reheating temperature but leave a wide window open for the acceptable values of the reheating temperatures : certainly larger than about 100 mev , and desirably , larger than say about 1 tev but not close to gut scale .",
    "the standard picture@xcite of old and new inflation invokes a scalar field , the inflaton , that produces a phase transition ( either second or first order ) and that at the end of inflation the expectation value of its zero momentum mode oscillates about the minimum of its ( effective ) potential . in chaotic inflation@xcite",
    ", the inflaton energy density still drives an inflationary phase , but there need not be any phase transition for this to occur .",
    "this inflaton field is constrained@xcite to have a mass a few orders of magnitude smaller than the planck mass , but typically much larger than the masses of the particles involved in the particle physics models . in the standard view of inflationary models ,",
    "the expectation value of the inflaton field oscillates around the minimum of its potential , and its couplings to the lighter particles allow the inflaton field to decay .",
    "this decay process is then supposed to induce a damping term in the evolution equation for the inflaton expectation value of the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the total decay rate of the inflaton field@xcite .",
    "the standard estimate for the reheating temperature based on single - particle decay@xcite is then obtained by comparing the total decay rate of the particle ( @xmath1 ) to that of the expansion , obtaining @xmath2@xcite .",
    "recent investigations of the non - linear quantum dynamics of scalar fields reveal a variety of new and striking phenomena@xcite .",
    "the main relevant implication for the reheating problem being that the particle production induced by the time evolution of the inflaton is significatively * different * from linear estimates .",
    "the non - linear ( quantum ) effects lead to an extremely effective dissipational dynamics and particle production even in the simplest self - interacting scalar field theory@xcite in which single particle decay is kinematically forbidden . in the case in which only the _ classical _ evolution of the expectation value is taken into account in the evolution of the quantum fluctuations",
    ", this mechanism corresponds to parametric amplification or parametric resonance , because the classical time evolution is periodic in time @xcite .",
    "however when back - reaction effects are taken into account , particle production damps out the evolution of the scalar field , and this damped evolution is incorporated in the equations for the quantum fluctuations . in this case the time evolution of the scalar field _ including _ the dissipative effects is not periodic ; this implies that the situation is far different from parametric amplification .",
    "we refer to this situation , which includes the back - reaction effects as * induced amplification * , to distinguish it from parametric resonant amplification @xcite .",
    "back - reaction effects@xcite drastically change the picture of particle production . in the case of parametric amplification",
    ", particle production never shuts off and the total number of particles created is infinite in minkowski .",
    "it is only when the back - reaction is incorporated that the damping effects on the expectation value feed back to the particle production mechanism , eventually shutting it off .",
    "this has been studied in detail analytically and numerically in@xcite for a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "induced amplification is most effective when the amplitude of the expectation value of the scalar field ( from the equilibrium value ) is large and is , therefore , an intrinsically non - linear process , which we refer to as _ non - linear relaxation_.    particle production via parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations has been studied recently in the semiclassical approximation , but without back - reaction effects , in connection with fermion production by ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone bosons@xcite .",
    "induced amplification and non - linear relaxation will be the primary mechanism for dissipation via particle production in the case of large amplitude of the scalar field .",
    "such is the case in chaotic infation scenarios@xcite , as well as in the out of equilibrium regime during phase transitions for fields with very flat potentials near the maximum , which is typically required for a long inflationary phase and also occurs for the moduli fields in string theory@xcite . in these inflationary models with light moduli fields , with masses typically of the order of a tev , and couplings of order ( @xmath3 )",
    "the standard reheating theory predicts reheating temperatures of the order of 0.01mev , well below nucleosynthesis temperatures , this is the polonyi problem@xcite .",
    "the non - linear mechanism of induced amplification of fluctuations and copious particle production in the large amplitude regime of the scalar field will necessarily modify the standard picture of reheating .",
    "the standard reheating scenario was primarily based on the premise that particle production only ocurred when the inflaton oscillates with small amplitude at the bottom of the ( effective ) potential .",
    "understanding the time scales and non - linear processes of reheating and eventually thermalization acquires further importance with the ( speculative ) possibility that asymptotic oscillations of the inflaton field around the minima of the ( effective ) potential may still be present in today s universe in the form of dark matter@xcite .",
    "thermalization is a process that is fundamentally different from particle production .",
    "typically , as will be seen below , the particles produced by the process of induced amplification will be in a non - thermal distribution@xcite .",
    "thermalization is a collisional process , in which the produced particles will exchange energy ( and momentum ) and eventually achieve a thermal distribution . in principle",
    "the time scales for dissipation via particle production may be widely different from the time scales of collisional thermalization .",
    "for very weakly coupled theories , if the distribution of produced particles via induced amplification is very far from thermal , many collisions will be necessary to thermalize the system and the time scale for thermalization may very well be large compared to the time scale of dissipation via particle production .",
    "this will have implications in cosmology discussed in the conclusions .",
    "the process of thermalization , reheating and relaxation of perturbations , and the ensuing production of entropy is also very relevant in heavy ion collisions@xcite and in phase transitions in particle physics , at the electroweak scale within the context of baryogenesis@xcite , as well as for the quark - gluon plasma , deconfining and chiral phase transitions@xcite .    in the linear relaxation case",
    "the important scale is determined by the decay rate @xmath1 , usually referred to as the damping rate .",
    "the literature@xcite usually identifies @xmath4 with the `` thermalization rate '' . here",
    "@xmath5 is the imaginary part of the self - energy . in this article",
    "we offer a _ real time _ critique of this relation by studying the real time evolution and relaxation of linearized perturbations , and point out the following observations :    1 .",
    "the damping rate is identical to the imaginary part of the self energy _",
    "only _ when the inflaton ( the particle interpolated by the order parameter ) is a resonance with @xmath1 being its width .",
    "in the complex frequency plane this corresponds to a pole in the second ( unphysical ) riemann sheet . even in this case",
    ", this damping rate corresponds to the relaxation of the _ expectation value of the scalar field _ and is exponential for some time regime .",
    "however , eventually relaxation continues with a power law tail . when the imaginary part is zero on - shell and",
    "the one particle pole is below the multiparticle thresholds , relaxation is given by a power law and no damping rate can be associated with the imaginary part of the self energy .",
    "moreover , the relation @xmath6 only holds in the * linear * approximation around equilibrium .",
    "even when relaxation of the expectation value of the scalar field is exponential , this damping rate determines the approach to equilibrium of the _ expectation value _ of the scalar field but it can not be immediately inferred that the same time scale describes thermalization , i.e. the approach to a bose einstein distribution of an initial off - equilibrium distribution .",
    "thermalization is a rather different process and has to be described with a boltzmann equation with a collision term .",
    "thus , rather than interpreting this time scale as a thermalization scale , we interpret it as a relaxation scale for the expectation value .",
    "we consider the non - linear quantum field evolution ( non - linear relaxation ) incorporating the order parameter into the effective mass in a self - consistent way .",
    "[ the self - consistency requirement makes the evolution equations non - linear ] .",
    "we study the inflaton evolution in real time coupled both to light scalars and fermions , providing exhaustive numerical results .",
    "we find that the non - linear relaxation time scales can be * much shorter * than those predicted by linear relaxation .",
    "in addition , the particles are produced with a momentum distribution that is very far from thermal and skewed towards low momentum . in the case of fermions",
    "we provide numerical evidence for the phenomenon of pauli blocking that hinders dissipation and production of fermion - antifermion pairs .",
    "this phenomenon is very similar to that found by kluger and collaborators@xcite in their studies of fermionic back - reaction in the presence of strong electric fields .",
    "we find that the reheating temperature is in between the inflaton mass and the lighter scalar mass .",
    "the precise relation is argued to depend on the product of the coupling and the initial amplitude of the inflaton zero mode and also logarithmically on the coupling .",
    "the distribution of produced particles is very far from thermal and skewed towards momenta of the order of or smaller than the inflaton mass .",
    "we argue that this implies fairly long thermalization times and a wide separation of the relevant time scales .",
    "both time scales will have to be understood in detail to provide a _ quantitative _ and reliable estimate of the reheating temperature .",
    "although we are ultimately interested in describing reheating and thermalization in friedmann - robertson - walker cosmologies , in this article we will work in minkowski space _ assuming _ that the relaxation time scales are much shorter than the expansion time scale .",
    "furthermore , we want to isolate dissipative effects arising from particle production from those resulting from the red - shift in an expanding cosmology .    a more detailed account of the results presented here can be found in ref.@xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the general model that we propose to study and summarize the necessary ingredients of non - equilibrium field theory to provide the reader with the essentials needed to reproduce our calculations , as these do not seem to be part of the standard techniques . in section iii",
    ", we study linear relaxation in real time and elucidate the rle of the imaginary parts of self energies , their interpretation in real time and criticize the identification with `` thermalization rates '' . here",
    "we provide a derivation of the reheating temperature based on single particle decay , valid in the linear regime of coherent oscillations of the scalar ( inflaton ) field .",
    "we also discuss the basics of the polonyi problem .    in section",
    "iv we study the process of non - linear relaxation , and particle production both for scalars and fermions , providing exhaustive numerical results . here",
    "we also discuss the issue of thermalization , and the important time scales associated with this collisional process . under the assumption of thermalization rates larger than the expansion rate we provide an estimate of the reheating temperature based on the total number of produced particles .",
    "finally we conclude in section v with a discussion of the implications of our results , in particular we emphasize the possibility that the new mechanism for reheating may provide a solution to the polonyi problem . an appendix is devoted to a pedagogical exercise in non - equilibrium field theory .",
    "we consider the simplest model @xcite where the inflaton field @xmath7 couples to a scalar @xmath8 and to a fermion field @xmath9 .",
    "that is ,    @xmath10    the case @xmath11 will be of particular relevance , since in this case there are open decay channels for the inflaton .",
    "we will investigate the scalar and fermionic couplings independently .",
    "although the situation for reheating corresponds to ( almost ) zero temperature , we will study the case of linear relaxation at finite temperature .",
    "the reason for this is that finite temperature effects reflect the bose enhancement and pauli blocking factors that appear whenever there are excitations in the medium .",
    "these contributions from the medium will allow us to identify similar physical features in the case of non - linear relaxation .",
    "to explore the behavior of the inflaton within the linear regime , we first use the tadpole method to obtain the equation of motion ( [ tad ] ) ( see the appendix for details on how this method is actually applied and reference@xcite for an alternative implementation ) . the next step is to linearize this equation in the inflaton zero mode amplitude and use this to study the relaxational dynamics of the inflaton .",
    "we should note that this amplitude expansion is _ a priori _ different from the standard perturbative expansion in the relevant coupling constant . later in this work",
    ", we will compare the results obtained here with results obtained through a self - consistent , non - perturbative resummation both in the coupling constants _ and _ the field amplitude .",
    "we arrange the initial conditions to be such that the fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 start to interact at a time that we choose @xmath12 .",
    "this can be accomplished by making the coupling `` constants '' time dependent , i.e. zero for @xmath13 and different from zero for @xmath14 . to perform the calculations",
    ", we will need the non - equilibrium green s functions and feynman rules .",
    "since the non - equilibrium generating functionals involve a forward and backward time contour@xcite , the number of vertices is doubled .",

    "we expect damping via production of fermion pairs to be strongly suppressed by pauli blocking .",
    "this phenomenon has been seen numerically in the case of fermion pair production in strong electric fields@xcite and will be seen numerically in the non - linear relaxation case later .      from the analysis presented above ,",
    "the following conclusions for the linear regime become very clear :    1 .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy only determines a _ relaxation rate _ in the case of a * resonance * , that is when there is an imaginary part on - shell for the external particle and the ( quasi ) particle pole moves off the physical sheet into the second ( unphysical ) sheet . in this case",
    "a breit - wigner approximation describes the exponential relaxation for a long time , but eventually the amplitude falls - off with a power law in time , with the power determined by the behavior of the spectral density at threshold . when the on - shell pole is below the two - particle threshold , the imaginary part does not translate to a damping rate .",
    "relaxation is described by a power law with an asymptotic behavior completely determined by the position and residue of the pole .",
    "2 .   even in the case of a resonance and exponential damping ,",
    "the `` damping rate '' @xmath1 describes exponential relaxation for the _ expectation value _ of the scalar field .",
    "the issue of thermalization is completely different .",
    "thermalization corresponds to the time evolution of the ( quasi ) particle distribution function towards a thermal distribution which , in principle , has nothing to do with the relaxation of the expectation value of the field .    an alternative way to look at thermalization is as a process of momentum and energy transfer .",
    "thus , the thermalization rate should be identified with the rate of energy and momentum transfer which is not necessarily related to the relaxation rate of the expectation value of the field . in order to understand thermalization , a collisional ( quantum ) boltzmann equation must be set up .",
    "although in the born approximation the collision term includes the scattering cross section that is related to the decay rate , the solution to the boltzmann equation implies a resummation that is quite different from the resummation of the dyson series for the propagator .",
    "if the initial distribution is very far from thermal and many collisions are necessary for thermalization , the relaxation and thermalization time scales may be widely different and in principle unrelated . thus we insist that the `` damping rate '' obtained from the imaginary part of the self - energy _ on shell _ must be interpreted as the relaxation rate for the expectation value of the scalar field and in principle _ not _ with the thermalization rate of the particle distribution function . moreover , this relaxation rate holds in the linear regime ( small field amplitude ) .",
    "we can use the results obtained above to provide an estimate of the reheating temperature based on single particle decay and valid * only in the linear regime*@xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the calculations of the relaxation and decay rate were performed in flat minkowski space these will only be useful for an estimate of the reheating temperature whenever @xmath155 with @xmath156 being the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "since the calculation of the rate even in flat space relies on a `` sharp resonance approximation '' ( breit wigner ) this implies that the lifetime of the particle is much longer than its oscillation period .",
    "this translates into the constraint @xmath157 .",
    "the inflaton oscillates coherently many times around the minimum of the potential before its oscillation amplitude diminishes appreciably both as a result of decay into lighter particles and because of the red - shift of the energy .",
    "the friedman equation for the rate of expansion is @xmath158 with @xmath159 the matter energy density .",
    "after the reheating stage is completed it is expected that the light produced particles will be in the form of radiation ( ultrarelativistic ) , thus @xmath160 . during the period in which the relaxation rate ( or rate of particle production ) is @xmath161",
    "the produced particles will be red - shifted in energy and will not contribute to a radiation dominated universe .",
    "only when the expansion rate becomes smaller than the rate of particle production is when the produced particles will remain as a radiation dominated component .",
    "thus the important time scale for which the produced particles will remain as a radiation dominated component in the universe is that for which @xmath162 . at this time",
    "@xmath163 leading to the estimate of the reheating temperature within the linear regime :    @xmath164      one area of current interest in which this work may have some implications is that of the so - called `` post - modern polonyi problem '' concerning flat directions for some of the moduli fields in string theories@xcite .",

    "this pauli blocking effect is explicit in eq .",
    "( [ widthfer ] ) but there it appears from finite temperature effects . in the non - linear relaxation case , we began at zero temperature , but an excited state quickly ensues because of particle production .",
    "this analysis reveals that for large amplitudes of the scalar field , fermions will be rather ineffective in dissipation and damping because of pauli blocking _ even at zero temperature_. the time scales for dissipation obtained from the fermion self - energies , which apply to the case of linear relaxation are completely unrelated to the time scales for non - linear dissipative processes , even asymptotically , because the fermionic states are pauli blocked .",
    "the self - consistent resummed one - loop approximation used in our analysis does not incorporate collisional processes .",
    "these will appear in the next ( two loop order ) .",
    "the distribution of the particles produced is clearly very far from thermal , with typically very many particles in the low momentum modes @xmath275 .",
    "although a full study of thermalization will necessarily involve the two loop contribution ( and consequently memory effects that will ultimately result in an extensive numerical effort ) , we can argue on the basis of an effective boltzmann description .",
    "we can take the distribution of particles obtained from the numerical analysis at long times ( times longer than the non - linear relaxation scale ) as an input in a boltzmann equation .",
    "the integration of this boltzmann equation will determine the time scales for collisional thermalization . because the couplings will be typically very small and the initial occupations are rather far from thermal equilibrium",
    "these collisional time scales will be very long ( as compared to the non - linear relaxation scales ) .",
    "collisional relaxation does not change the number of particles and is energy conserving ( in flat minkowsky space ) , just re - distributes the occupation .",
    "therefore a thermal equilibrium state will result with the total number of particles given by the number of produced particles obtained during the fast period of induced amplification and the final reheating temperature will be determined by this number of particles .",
    "including the collisional relaxation via the boltzmann equation during the period of induced amplification will not modify the time scales substantially .",
    "the reason is that initially the occupation numbers are rather small and boltzmann processes are suppressed .",
    "since the rate of particle production depends on the couplings _ and _ the initial amplitudes , for large values of the amplitudes the rate of particle production will be much larger than the rate of equilibration via boltzmann processes ( second order in the couplings and independent of the initial amplitude ) . thus collisional ( boltzmann ) processes will become relevant for thermalization at times much longer ( for weak coupling ) than the times during which most of the particle production takes place .",
    "if the rate of thermalization obtained from this boltzmann equation is much larger than the expansion rate of the universe , then the reheating temperature can just be estimated from the total number of particles produced during the period of induced amplification .",
    "however if this collisional thermalization rate is much smaller than the expansion rate there will be substantial redshifting of the temperature and a full numerical analysis will have to be carried out to obtain a reliable estimate of the reheating temperature .      with the arguments on thermalization given above in mind , and _ assuming _ that the thermalization rate is much larger than the expansion rate ( no red - shifting of the temperature ) , we can use the numerical analysis presented above to obtain an estimate of the reheating temperature .",
    "the important conclusion of the numerical integration is that the density of particles produced during the period of induced amplification is @xmath276 where @xmath277 is a mass in between the inflaton and the @xmath8 field masses .",
    "@xmath278 a constant of @xmath279 .",
    "this constant depends on the _ product _ of the coupling constants and the _ initial amplitudes _ as can be seen from the mode equations .",
    "it also depends approximately logarithmically on the coupling constants because of the time scales for the shutting - off of the induced amplification mechanism .",
    "this can be seen as follows : from the expression for the number of ( bosonic ) particles produced we find the _ rate _ of particle production ( for example for the @xmath8 field ) @xmath280 \\frac{d |v_k(t)|^2}{dt } \\label{rateparprod}\\ ] ] this expression clearly shows that the _ rate _ of particle production depends on the produc of the coupling and the initial amplitude ( squared for the interaction considered ) , since the mode functions also depend on this combination .",
    "the total number of particles is given by this rate integrated up to the time at which the amplification mechanism is shut - off by the back reaction .",
    "un upper bound to this time is estimated as follows : in the early stages , the mode functions increase almost exponentially ( because of the resonances ) this growth is modified by the damping of the amplitude of the zero mode . since we find that the back reaction shuts - off the particle production when the one loop term becomes of the order of the tree - level term , this gives a time scale that is logarithmic in the coupling .",
    "thus even for very small couplings but very large initial amplitude of the inflaton zero mode ( and this is the situation in cosmological scenarios ) the constant @xmath278 will be of @xmath279 and can be enhanced by giving the inflaton a larger initial amplitude . under the assumption of thermalization on time scales shorter than the expansion scale and that the mass of scalars and fermions are much smaller than the inflaton mass an estimate of the reheating temperature is obtained as @xmath281",
    "the reheating and thermalization processes in inflationary universe models occur very far from equilibrium and must be studied in their full complexity , eventually numerically .",
    "the methods developed within real - time non - equilibrium field theory allow a consistent treatment that we used to obtain the equations of evolution for the expectation value of the inflaton field .",
    "these equations are non - perturbative and take into account the back reaction effect of both the self couplings of the inflaton , as well as the couplings to lighter scalars and fermions .",
    "we have examined these evolution equations , both in the linear regime , in which the amplitude of the field is small and in the opposite extreme , the non - linear regime , which is intrinsically non - perturbative .    in the linear regime",
    ", we have seen that if the inflaton mass is above the two particle threshold , there is some damping behavior for a period of time , and indeed , this damping is governed by the total width of the inflaton",
    ". however , at late times the behavior is dominated by _ power law _",
    "decay rather than exponential damping .",
    "furthermore , we have noted the important distinction between the time scale for the relaxation of the expectation value of the inflaton as opposed to thermalization of the produced particles .",
    "it is clear that as treated in this work , relaxation can occur well before thermalization , i.e. interactions that drive the particle distributions towards a thermal one , has a chance to become relevant .    the more interesting case , and",
    "the one which would most likely be relevant to the reheating problem in models such as chaotic inflation@xcite , is that of when the inflaton is in the non - linear regime . unlike the elementary approach to reheating ,",
    "in which the `` decay '' of the coherent inflaton oscillations occured a time @xmath282 , where @xmath1 is the inflaton decay width , after the end of the slow - roll regime , particle production in the non - linear regime begins at very early times and then shuts off .",
    "indeed , by the time the inflaton expectation value reaches its asymptotic state of oscillations around its minimum , the period of particle production is essentially over .",
    "this will be the stage of thermalization via collisions , however we find that the spectrum of produced particles is extremely non - thermal , and collisional relaxation towards an equilibrium thermal state may take a long time .",
    "an inflationary model that can not reheat the universe to at least nucleosynthesis temperatures is wrong .",
    "thus it is clearly important to accurately compute the reheating temperature in inflationary models .",
    "what our analysis here shows is that this computation is of necessity much more complicated than has previously been thought but perhaps more importantly that there are different time scales .",
    "although so far we have studied the situation in flat minkowski space , recent investigations by kaiser@xcite reveal that these non - linear processes will still be very effective in inflationary cosmologies .",
    "the first stage which occurs rather fast is that of particle production and damping of oscillations as a result of induced amplification .",
    "the second stage , that begins typically when the amplitude of the inflaton is rather small and it oscillates with almost constant amplitude at the bottom of the potential is that of one - particle decay and of thermalization via collisional relaxation .",
    "the thermalization time will have to be studied setting up a ( quantum ) boltzmann equation using the distributions of produced particles at the end of the induced amplification stage as input for the boltzmann evolution .",
    "since these initial distributions are very far from equilibrium , it may take many collisions to relax to a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "if the couplings are very small ( and this will clearly depend on the models ) the thermalization time may be very large .",
    "following the particle numbers to the point at which they become thermal would then allow us to pick off the final reheating temperature . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "as mentioned above , the thermalization rate may be smaller than the expansion rate , allowing for significant redshifting of the total energy density , leading to a low reheat temperature , perhaps of the order of the inflaton mass or less .",
    "the particular case of large thermalization rates compared to the expansion rate , allows for a quick estimate of the reheating temperature . in this case",
    "we can assume that thermalization occurs without red - shifting of the energy which is then conserved during the thermalization time . by taking the energy density at the beginning of this stage to be @xmath283 with @xmath284 the stephan boltzmann accounting for the particle statistics one can then obtain an estimate of the reheating temperature , but the justification for this should ultimately arise from a deeper understanding of the time scales involved .",
    "our main point in all of this , though , is that self - consistent calculations taking into account the non - linearity of the dynamics are necessary in order to extract the reheating temperature in a reliable way .",
    "our work clarifies what the relevant particle production mechanisms are in these theories and provide a consistent and implementable framework of calculation .",
    "we are now extending these studies to frw cosmologies .",
    "we emphasized in this study that thermalization and particle production are fundamentally different processes and in the non - linear regime likely to occur on widely different time scales .",
    "as mentioned before a problem of much current interest in which this work may have some implications is the `` post - modern polonyi problem '' concerning flat directions for some of the moduli fields in string theories@xcite . in these scenarios",
    "the polonyi fields are very light ( of order of a tev ) with couplings to the particle physics sector that is extremely small ( order of @xmath285 ) .",
    "a calculation of the reheating temperature based on the `` old '' scenario of one particle decay give @xmath286 , well below the nucleosynthesis scale .",
    "this may not necessarily be true given our analysis .",
    "since particle production occurs not just during oscillations around the minimum now but throughout the evolution of the the moduli field . even for couplings",
    "@xmath287 since the initial amplitudes of these moduli field are @xmath288 then the mechanism of particle production via induced amplification will be very efficient and our analysis leads to an estimate of the reheating temperature @xmath289 that is larger than the electroweak scale , alleviating the polonyi problem .",
    "thus this mechanism may very well provide a solution to the polonyi problem reconciling moduli field cosmology with standard big bang cosmology .",

    "<S> the reheating stage in post - inflationary cosmologies is reanalyzed . </S>",
    "<S> new techniques from non - equilibrium quantum field theory allow a consistent derivation of the equation of motion including the non - linearity of the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these offer a rationale for the elementary theory of reheating based on single particle decay which is seen to be valid only in the linear regime of coherent oscillations of the scalar field .    a new non - perturbative mechanism of induced amplification of quantum fluctuations is introduced and studied in detail , both analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non - linear mechanism that is typically a far more efficient way of transfering energy out of the zero mode and into production of lighter particles than single particle decay . </S>",
    "<S> thermalization is discussed and we estimate the reheating temperature to be of the order of the inflaton mass , thus providing a potential solution to the polonyi and moduli problems . </S>"
