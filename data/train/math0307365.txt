    "@xcite asked a similar question : is there a natural number @xmath3 such that the vertices of _ any _ planar graph can be non - repetitively coloured using at most @xmath3 colours ? here",

    "[ map ] if @xmath1 is an outerplanar map , then the faces of @xmath1 can be non - repetitively coloured using at most five colours .",
    "we assume that we have an outerplanar embedding of @xmath1 .",
    "it suffices to show that the vertices of the dual graph @xmath4 can be coloured non - repetitively using at most five colours .",
    "consider the weak dual @xmath5 formed by deleting the vertex of @xmath4 corresponding to the outer face of @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that if @xmath1 is outerplanar , then @xmath5 is a forest of trees .",
    "@xcite mention that the vertices of any tree can be non - repetitively coloured using at most four colours .",
    "hence , the weak dual @xmath5 can be non - repetitively coloured with at most four colours .",
    "finally , add back the vertex initially deleted from @xmath4 and colour it using a fifth colour . the resulting 5-colouring of the dual graph @xmath4 induces a non - repetitive colouring of the faces of the outerplanar map @xmath1 .",
    "we will construct such a graph @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the graph @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ the graph consisting of a simple path on four vertices .",
    "since there are no non - repetitive binary sequences of length four , we require at least three colours to non - repetitively colour @xmath6 . next we add a vertex @xmath7 , connecting it with an edge to each of the vertices of @xmath6 , thus forming the so - called _ fan graph _ @xmath8 .",
    "let us call the vertex @xmath7 the _ rivet _ of the fan .",
    "since @xmath7 is connected to vertices of three different colours , it is evident that @xmath7 must be coloured a fourth colour .",
    "the graph @xmath1 then consists of _ five _ disjoint copies of @xmath8 , with an additional vertex @xmath9 connected to the rivet of each fan ( see figure  [ out_pic ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath1 is an outerplanar graph .",
    "if we assume that we only have four colours with which to work , then by the pigeonhole principle , two rivets , say @xmath7 and @xmath10 , must be coloured the same colour , say @xmath11 .",
    "the vertex @xmath9 can not be coloured @xmath11 , so @xmath9 must be coloured with one of the three remaining colours , say @xmath12 .",
    "however , the subgraph @xmath6 connected to the rivet @xmath7 contains vertices coloured with three distinct colours different from @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we can always find a vertex @xmath13 such that the path @xmath14 has colouring @xmath15 .",
    "this is clearly a repetition , and so we see that we need at least five colours to non - repetitively colour @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of @xmath1 is readily apparent from figure  [ plan_pic ] .",
    "let us label the two vertices of @xmath1 with degree eight @xmath9 and @xmath16 .",
    "let us call each of the connected components of the subgraph formed by deleting @xmath9 and @xmath16 from @xmath1 a _",
    "diamond_. by reasoning similar to that used in the proof of theorem  [ outer ] , we may conclude that each diamond requires at least five colours for a non - repetitive colouring .",
    "assume that we have a non - repetitive 6-colouring of @xmath1 .",
    "now consider the seven vertices of @xmath1 with degree seven . by the pigeonhole principle",
    ", two of these vertices must have the same colour .",
    "let us call these two vertices @xmath7 and @xmath10 , and let us assume that they are each coloured @xmath11 .",
    "let us call each of the two diamonds containing @xmath7 and @xmath10 @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are each coloured using exactly five colours , but the five colours used are not the same for each diamond . in this case ,",
    "between @xmath17 and @xmath18 all six colours are used , and so for all choices @xmath12 , @xmath19 , for the colour of @xmath9 we can always find a vertex @xmath13 in one of @xmath17 or @xmath18 such that the path @xmath14 has colouring @xmath15 .",
    "hence , it must be the case that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are each coloured using exactly the same colours .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are each coloured using all six colours , then again we can always find a vertex @xmath13 in one of @xmath17 or @xmath18 such that the path @xmath14 has colouring @xmath15 .",
    "it is therefore the case that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are each coloured using exactly the same five colours .",
    "thus we may colour @xmath9 using the colour that does not appear in @xmath17 or @xmath18 ; any other choice @xmath12 , @xmath19 , will allow us to find a vertex @xmath13 in one of @xmath17 or @xmath18 such that the path @xmath14 has colouring @xmath15 .",
    "however , by this same argument we find that @xmath16 must be coloured the same colour as @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath9 and @xmath16 are adjacent , this is a contradiction , and so we have that @xmath1 can not be non - repetitively coloured using fewer than seven colours .",
