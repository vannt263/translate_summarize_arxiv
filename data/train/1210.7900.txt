    "n atom abundance is high ( @xmath97 ) * the peak temperature of the shocked gas is @xmath128 2000 k.    we have also compared our reaction network model with umist91 , which is adopted in the hot core model of charnley & millar ( 1994 ) .",
    "phosphorus chemistry sensitively depends on the abundance of n atoms , which in turn depends on n- and o - chemistry .",
    "we identified several neutral - neutral reactions with different rate coefficients in our network models and umist91 , and these reactions significantly affect the p - chemistry . we confirmed that our conclusion  a high abundance of n atoms in the pre - shock gas is needed to make pn abundant  is valid even if we modify the rate coefficients of these reactions to those of umist91 .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that , even in hot core models , high n atom abundance is needed to make po less abundant than pn at @xmath92 yr , if we adopt our updated network instead of umist91 .",
