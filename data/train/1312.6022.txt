    "in 1867 , maxwell summoned his famous demon and pointed out that the second law of thermodynamics is seemingly violated in the thermodynamic processes with measurements and feedback controls . since then , thermodynamics with information processes have been the center of attention and numerous studies have been done  @xcite .",
    "the researches for such thermodynamic processes mainly consist of two types .",
    "the first type of researches considers thermodynamic systems and tries to solve the seeming violation of the second law  @xcite . in the researches of this type , we measure the excess of the work extracted from a thermodynamic system over the conventional second law .",
    "the excess is equal to the amount of correlation extracted by the measurement ; the correlation is measured by the classical mutual information in classical systems and by entanglement of formation in quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the second type of researches considers the energy costs of the information processes and seeks the restoration of the second law  @xcite . in the researches of this type",
    ", we measure the excess of the energy costs of the information processes such as measurement and information erasure and compare the energy costs with the excess which is derived in the first type .    for classical systems ,",
    "the above two types have been recently integrated into the form of the fluctuation theorem  @xcite ; we can derive both the inequality for the excess of work and the inequality for the energy costs from the information exchange fluctuation theorem  @xcite .",
    "this fluctuation theorem has been generalized to for case of multiple systems  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorem has been also derived for quantum systems  @xcite , but our comprehension is still limited . in the present article ,",
    "we present quantum versions of the jarzynski equalities for the energy costs of the measurement and the information erasure . using the jensen inequality ,",
    "we can derive two inequalities which bound the energy costs .",
    "the inequalities include sagawa and ueda s inequalities  @xcite as a special case .",
    "an equality similar to our jarzynski equality for the energy cost of the measurement was recently derived by funo , watanabe and ueda @xcite .",
