    "many thousands of variable stars were known ( roth 1994 ) .",
    "however , it was not until the 1990s that microlensing surveys changed the scale of variable star research .",
    "groups such as macho ( alcock et al .",

    "over much larger and less crowded areas of the sky , the very wide - field cameras of the asas survey ( pojmanski 1997 ) soon led to the discovery of tens of thousands of variable stars down to @xmath2 ( pojmanski 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ; pojmanski & maciejewski 2004a , b ; pojmanski et al .  2005 ) .",

    "these consist of the catalina schmidt survey ( css ) and the mount lemmon survey ( mls ) in tucson , arizona , and the siding spring survey ( sss ) in siding spring , australia .",

    ", we concentrate on the data taken by the css 0.7 m telescope ( css ) between april 2005 and june 2011 , that was made publicly available via csdr1 ( drake et al .",

    "we have chosen to select only the 20,155 square degrees covered by csdr1 in the region @xmath5 and @xmath6 as sources below @xmath7 have better temporal coverage in sss data that became available january 2013 as part of catalina surveys data release 2 ( csdr2 ) and will be anaylsed separately .",
    "in order to find the variable sources with csdr1 we began by selecting variables based on values of the stetson variability index ( @xmath8 , stetson 1996 ) using the weighting scheme of zhang et al .",
    "the current analysis method follows drake et al .",
    "( 2013a , b ) .",
    "however , have revised our variable selection process to better account for blending .",
    "this occurs in csdr1 photometry as it is based on sextractor aperture magnitudes . during poor",
    "seeing or sky conditions , close pairs or groups of sources are detected as a single object , while in good seeing conditions the objects are resolved and appear at their true brightness .",
    "blending is important for variable star selection since variations in seeing cause artificial changes in the apparent brightness of many catalog objects .",
    "candidate blended sources can be found by selecting master catalog objects that have multiple detections from a single observation .",
    "however , these multi - detection associations can also occur due to image artifacts and transient sources ( such as passing asteroids ) .",
    "thus , even isolated objects often have some nights where multiple detections have been matched from a single image .    to reduce the effect of blends we investigated the distribution of the number of detections ( @xmath9 ) for a few of the observation fields .",
    "sources in the range @xmath10 are not affected by saturation or the natural decline in detection efficiency with decreasing brightness .",
    "using these sources we determined the average number of detections for sources within a field ( @xmath11 ) . by inspecting the light curves of the objects with high numbers of detections we found that objects with @xmath12 were usually significantly affected by a neighbouring source .",
    "we removed all variable candidates with @xmath13 that had more detections than this threshold .",
    "in contrast to additional detections due to blending , sources with @xmath14 often have @xmath9 well below @xmath11 .",
    "this is because of saturation since such observations were flagged removed from our period search .",
    "this means that the brightness sources may have few good observations .",
    "nevertheless , we found that it was possible to detect variability for sources brighter than @xmath15 because such sources are not saturated in poor seeing , or when they have dimmed significantly .",
    "therefore , to reduce the presence of artificial variability due to saturation effects , we only remove objects with @xmath16 that have @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless it is prudent to be cautious about the small fraction of sources near the saturation limit . the data from shallower surveys , such as asas ( pojmanski 1997 ) and nsvs wozniak et al .",
    "2004 ) , may used to further verify the nature these sources .",
    "in addition to the change to our treatment of blended and saturated sources , we discovered that there were systematic variations in the photometric noise level between fields .",
    "therefore , instead of adopting a universal @xmath8 variability threshold as per drake et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , we derived separate thresholds for each field .",
    "firstly , we ordered all the sources within each field by their average magnitude .",
    "we then determined the average variability ( @xmath18 ) , and its standard deviation ( @xmath19 ) , in groups of 200 sources .",
    "since highly variable sources bias the @xmath8 distribution , we perform a 3-sigma clipping on the values and redetermine the average and sigma values of this statistic .",
    "as there are thousands of sources in each field with @xmath20 , we combined @xmath8 values in 0.25 magnitude bins to provide more robust values .",
    "variable candidates were selected at a @xmath21 threshold that was interpolated to their observed average brightness . in figure",
    "[ var ] , we plot the magnitude distribution of @xmath8 values for the sources in two fields as well as with the variability threshold used by drake et al .",
    "( 2013a ) .",
    "this plot demonstrates that there is a significant variation in the distribution of @xmath8 values with source brightness and field .",
    "in contrast to drake et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , where 8 million variable candidates were selected , our new selection reduces this number to 5.4 million .",
    "this is 2.7% of the total number of catalog sources .",
    "we ran lomb - scargle ( ls , lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) periodogram analysis on all the variable candidates .",
    "candidate periodic variables were selected based on a ls significance statistic of @xmath22 .",
    "154 thousand candidates were found in addition to the @xmath015,000 known css rrab s ( drake et al .",
    "( 2013a , b ) . this threshold matches that used drake et al .",
    "( 2013b ) since @xmath23 of rrab s in the css data were found to have been missed because of the higher ( @xmath24 ) threshold used by drake et al .",
    "( 2013a )    although our variability selection process noted above removes bright blends , faint stars have fewer detections because of lower detection efficiency . to remove blends among faint sources , we select objects with @xmath25 coincident detections from the individual images .",
    "this reduces the number of periodic candidates to 144 thousand sources .",
    "we allow small numbers of multi - detections since , apart from multiple detection due to artifacts , some faint neighbouring objects may only appear in good seeing .",
    "such objects only have a minor effect on the overall photometry and period determination .    as with drake et al .",
    "( 2013a , b ) , the adaptive fourier decomposition ( afd ) method ( torrealba et al .",
    "2014 ) was run on all candidates to determine the best period for each source . as expected",
    ", there are many cases where a false signal is found due to the sampling pattern as well as variation in lunar phase and location .",
    "these effects lead to period estimates that are near fractions and multiples of a sidereal day , as well as near sidereal and synodic months .",
    "we investigated the extent of each of these aliases and removed candidates lying within the range of each period alias .",
    "there is also significant evidence for seasonal and annual variations .",
    "as these features are broad they were not removed .",
    "however , as we will show , these sources are removed during inspection .",
    "the removal of aliases reduces the numbers of candidates to 128 thousand .",
    "we expect that a small fraction ( a few percent ) of true variables with periods within these ranges were also removed by these cuts .    a clear way to reduce the number of non - periodic objects along the candidates is to select sources based on the goodness - of - fit , or reduced-@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , of the best afd period .",
    "as expected , we found that most of the periodic variable candidates had @xmath28 .",
    "a poor fit generally signifies that an object is either not periodic , or the best fit period is incorrect .",
    "however , sources such as long - period variables ( lpvs ) exhibit significant periodicity , yet are poorly fit by a low - order ( @xmath29 ) fourier series due to moderately large variations in amplitude over time . to simultaneously retain the significantly - periodic sources ,",
    "while removing poorly fit aperiodic sources , we removed the candidates that had both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting set contains @xmath32 candidates .    in figure [ perampinit ]",
    "we compare the period - amplitude distribution of the initial 154,000 periodic candidates with the @xmath32 sources remaining after removing blends , period alias and sources with poor afd fits .",
    "all @xmath33 periodic candidates were inspected ( by ajd ) using a custom - built web service .",
    "this process involved classifying the variable types as well as flagging objects that had periods which were slightly incorrect , or completely incorrect but still probably periodic variables .",
    "the classification process itself mainly involved examination and comparison of the phased ( an in some cases unphased ) lightcurve morphology with known types of periodic variables . to improve this process , additional consideration",
    "was always given to the range of periods , amplitudes and colours that different types of variables are known to have .",
    "for example , short period contact binaries are generally red , while rr lyrae are blue .",
    "the values of the m - test statitistic ( described below ) were also considered . however , none of these individual parameters were specifically used to classify or exclude types of variable since the observational data itself contains some objects with unusual values . for example , unexpected colours due to blending that could be confirmed when examining higher resolution sdss images .    in ambigous cases , such as may arise for faint objects , or when multiple types of variablity are present , the most evident and likely individual type based on the combined information .",
    "cases where the presence of actual periodicity was in question were vetoed . due to the nature of the process it is highly likely that some observational biases exist .",
    "it is also possible that some objects have best fit periods that are aliases of their true period .",
    "this could lead to the type of variability being wrongly classified .    during the inspection process",
    "the initial periods of a large number of the sources were improved and corrected . in particular ,",
    "most of the contact binaries were initially found at half of their true period because of the symmetry of their light curves .",
    "this half - period effect is a well - known problem ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "additionally , in @xmath34 cases the afd periods were very close to correct , but clearly not correct .",
    "we improved the period determinations of these sources interactively by making very slight adjustment to the period .",
    "as the actual final changes are generally @xmath35 the process almost always converged very quicky .",
    "however , in the case of detached eclipsing binaries , we often found the correct period by investigating the harmoic frequencies .",
    "in total , @xmath36 light curves were classified as corresponding to periodic variables . of these , 396 are objects with multiple light curves due to overlap between fields .",
    "the duplicates include 45 rrab s previously given by drake et al .",
    "( 2013a , b ) .",
    "the number of unique periodic variables is @xmath37 .",
    "another @xmath38 objects remain periodic candidates and will be provided online . in table",
    "[ psel ] , we show the effect of selections on the total number of candidates .",
    "to see how the visually selected periodic variables differs from the initial candidates we investigated the period , amplitude , and magnitude properties of the sources . in figure",
    "[ perampfin ] , we plot the period - amplitude distribution of the periodic variables in the catalog . in contrast to figure [ perampinit ] , here we plot the final periods of the objects rather than their initial periods .",
    "very few objects remain at periods less than 0.2 days .",
    "these objects are contact binaries suffering from half - period effect , as noted above .",
    "additionally , very few objects with periods longer than 10 days remain . in particular , there are no sources with periods longer than @xmath39 days .",
    "most of the stars with long periods are lpvs .",
    "there are very few lpvs in the fields we observed away from the galactic disk .",
    "the foreground lpvs are generally undetectable since they are bright and thus saturated within the images .",
    "some stars are known to have longer periods . however , like lpvs such stars are generally near our saturation limit .",
    "additionally the length of our data does not provide strong constrains for objects with very long periods .",
    "most of the candidates that were found at very long periods had best - fit periods matching the time span of the data .",
    "many of these sources were found to be quasars ( qsos ) and were clearly not periodic .",
    "a comparison of the periods for the 396 objects with multiple light curves revealed @xmath40 of the objects had different periods .",
    "inspection of the light curves revealed that almost all of these cases were due to contact binaries that were also well fit when folded at an alias of their true periods .",
    "since contact binaries dominate the number of periodic variables in this catalog , we expect that @xmath41 of the periods presented here are aliases .    in figure [ sig ]",
    ", we present the distribution of ls periodic significance ( @xmath42 ) for the catalog variables .",
    "this plot shows us that @xmath43 of the periodic candidates with @xmath44 were found to be periodic .",
    "however , since a very large fraction of the sources found at this level , they constitute @xmath45 of the total number in the catalog .",
    "this result suggests that a large number of periodic sources remain to be found at low levels of significance .",
    "however , since there are millions of sources at this level , their discovery within these data requires either new techniques , or automated methods of classification and verification .",
    "the number of aperiodic variables within these data ( such as qsos ) , far outnumbers the periodic sources ( graham et al .",
    "2014 in prep . ) .    in figure",
    "[ chi ] , we present the distribution of afd fit @xmath27 values for the initial periodic candidates and the final catalog sources . as expected , these figures show that most of the remaining periodic sources are moderately good fits with @xmath46 . most of the faint sources with large @xmath27 values have been removed .",
    "however , many of the sources with @xmath47 , where saturation increases the value of @xmath27 , were found to be periodic .",
    "in addition , we see that most of the remaining sources in the range @xmath48 have @xmath27 values significantly less than one .",
    "low values of @xmath27 can be caused by fitting too many parameters to the data , or inaccurate estimates of uncertainty . in this case , these low values are due to the systematic overestimation of the csdr1 error - bars . for the brightest sources",
    "the average @xmath27 is approximately 0.3 , suggesting that the actual photometric uncertainties are @xmath49 the csdr1 values .",
    "the fact that the csdr1 errors are overestimated was demonstrated by palaversa et al .",
    "they compared csdr2 light curves with those from linear .",
    "they found that the catalina error - bars were larger , yet the objects phased with the correct periods generally show less scatter .",
    "this is also demonstrated by the low average values of @xmath8 .",
    "the overestimated photometric uncertainties do not affect the results in this analysis .    in figure [ mag ]",
    ", we compare the distribution of mean magnitudes for the initial periodic variable candidates with the final catalog variables .",
    "the largest number of periodic sources are found near @xmath50 .",
    "this result is in contrast to the peak of the rrab magnitude distribution from drake et al .",
    "( 2013a ) , which occurred at @xmath51 . to demonstrate the reason for this difference , we separate the main types of periodic variables and plot them in figure [ perhist ] . here",
    "we see that the contact eclipsing binaries dominate the number of periodic variables , and on average they are brighter than the rr lyrae . unlike the rr lyrae , eclipsing binaries are mostly main - sequence stars with spectroscopic types earlier than @xmath52 ( norten et al .",
    "these systems generally lie within the galactic disk .",
    "hence , since css observations are concentrated away from the disk , only foreground eclipsing binaries are detected .",
    "figure [ perhist ] also presents the period distributions for the main types of periodic variables detected .",
    "it is evident that drake et al .",
    "( 2013a ) missed a small number of rrab s that have periods similar to rrc s and rrd s .",
    "each of the periodic variables found among the candidates were classified into three broad classes : eclipsing , pulsating and rotational .",
    "the pulsational objects can be divided into @xmath53 scutis , rr lyrae , mira and semi - regular variables , and cepheids . among these",
    "we further divide the @xmath53 scutis into those with amplitudes @xmath54 ( high - amplitude @xmath53 scutis , hads ) , and those with @xmath55 ( low - amplitude @xmath53 scutis , lads ) based on alcock et al .",
    "( 2000c ) .",
    "the rr lyrae class consists of rrab s ( fundamental mode ) , rrc s ( first overtone mode ) , rrd s ( multi - mode ) and blazkho ( long - term modulation ; blazkho 1907 ) types .",
    "the cepheid class include classical ( type - i ) cepheids , type - ii cepheids ( cep - ii ) and anomalous cepheids ( aceps ) .",
    "however , we did not find any clear classical cepheids .",
    "we include both semi - regular variables and mira variables under a single , lpv classification .",
    "the eclipsing variables in our data were generally divided into a contact and semi - detached binary ( ew / eb ) group and detached systems ( ea ) following palaversa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . however , during a review of all the ea s we further divided these systems into semi - detached @xmath56 lyrae ( eb ) systems and true algol ( ea ) variables .",
    "our eb group is thus incomplete , with those systems that closely resembling contact systems being placed in the original ew / eb group .",
    "we found a number of ea variables where it was not possible to determine the period due to an insufficient number of eclipses .",
    "these objects were placed in an unknown - period ( @xmath57 ) class .",
    "we also discovered many eclipsing white dwarf and subdwarf binary systems .",
    "these are included in a post - common - envelope ( pceb ) class .",
    "a small group of periodic variables exhibiting distorted light curves and varying minima and maxima was discovered .",
    "as the nature of these sources is unclear we place them in the `` hump '' variable class ( see section [ misc ] ) .",
    "the variable stars that we discovered from the rotating variable class include ellipsoid variables ( ell ) and spotted ( rs cvn ) systems .",
    "our inspection also led us to retain 4808 systems in a periodic candidates class ( pcands ) .",

    "determination of the correct classes of variables can be very important for studies of stellar populations .",
    "for example , the accurate classification of rr lyrae is necessary when they are used to trace structure within the galactic halo .",

    "we will investigate the extent of the potential eclipsing binary - rrc misclassification problem within our periodic variable catalog .    as with drake et al .",

    "it is immediately clear that there are two separate groups .",
    "here we have plotted the eclipsing binaries at half their true periods since this is the period which most were initally discovered with .",
    "the objects we classify as eclipsing binaries are strongly grouped at half - periods of @xmath59 and m - test values @xmath60 , while rrc s are concentrated at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    as with the drake et al .",

    "the difference between the @xmath58 values of the eclipsing binaries and rrc s is indicative of real morphological differences in the light curves .",
    "the contact binaries spend less time below their average brightness than rrc s that are closer to sinusoidal . however , apart from the two main clumps of variables , there are still many binaries with @xmath58 values and periods that overlap the rrc s .",
    "another way of distinguishing rrc s and binaries is by their amplitudes . in figure",
    "[ peramp ] , we plot the distribution of contact binaries and rrc s at their final periods . as noted earlier , most of the contact binaries were initially found at half - periods . also , the contact binaries have amplitudes @xmath63 , while the rrc s are generally concentrated near @xmath64 .",
    "when rrc s and contact binaries are plotted with their true periods ( figure [ peramp ] ) they completely overlap .",
    "however , in actuality the difference between these two classes of sources is clear from the light curves since the eclipsing binaries have two cycles per orbital period , while the rrc s have only one .",
    "the misidentification of contact binaries as rrc s should only occur for objects with amplitudes in range @xmath65 , and periods @xmath66 . from figure [ perhist ]",
    "it is clear that only a small fraction of contact binaries and rrc s have such periods . nevertheless , since there are large very numbers of contact binaries , it is worth considering additional information .      the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , wright et al",
    ".  2010 ) provides mid - ir data for sources across the entire sky . to further investigate the level of misclassification among the eclipsing binaries and rrc s , we matched all of our periodic sources with the wise catalog .",
    "of our @xmath33 initial candidates , @xmath67 had wise matches with @xmath68-band ( @xmath69 ) data within @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for sources from our final catalog ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "[ wise ] , we plot the colours and periods of the contact binaries and rrc s .",
    "the results demonstrate the significant colour variation between contact binaries and rrc s in addition to the clear colour evolution with period .",
    "the combination of @xmath74 colours and period thus provides an excellent means of separating relatively red contact binaries from bluer rrc s .",
    "however , at long periods , contact binaries still have similar colours to rrc s .",
    "another means of separating eclipsing binaries from rrc s is via multi - band optical photometry .",
    "we matched the initial periodic candidates with photometry from sdss data release 10 ( sdss - dr10 , ahn et al .",

    "the brightest lpvs are foreground disk stars that are seen concentrated at low galactic latitude , while the faintest lpvs we detected come from nearby galaxies , such as m31 . by selecting sources with @xmath115",

    "an additional eight lpvs are found in the region @xmath119 , @xmath120 that also overlaps with the sgr stream .    to further test the association of lpvs with the sagittarius stream we selected lpvs within @xmath121 of the plane of the sagittarius streams system defined by majewski et al .",

    ", we plot the locations of these objects .    under the assumption that lpvs have representative luminosities of around @xmath122 ( smak 1966 ) in csdr1 data , we find good agreement with the results based on rrab s and rrc s .",
    "however , lpvs are known to occupy six separate period - luminosity sequences ( fraser et al .",
    "2005 ) and perhaps more ( mosser et al .",
    "as many of the lpv sequences overlap in period range , to derive more accurate absolute magnitudes , hence distances , one must first determine the sequence of the variable .",
    "a combination of light curve morphology and multi - wavelength observations may enable this determination .",
    "nevertheless , the figure does show that there is a strong trend in the average brightness of lpvs which is consistent with membership of the sagittarius tidal stream .",
    "more than 99% of the periodic variables inspected clearly fall into to the types described above .",

    "the light curves in the right panel of figure [ zig ] exhibit some of the features of contact binaries presenting the oconnell effect .",
    "however , the shapes of these `` hump '' variables are much more erratic",
    ". this may be due to the presence of gas streams or hot spots on their surfaces , such as noted by wilsey & beaky ( 2009 ) . in total",
    "there are 68 objects in this group of which 25 are placed in the hump group .    during inspection of the periodic candidates in this work we discovered a number of non - periodic sources and periodic sources where the light curve did not fit any of the existing classifications .",
    "most of the non - periodic variables are simply stars and qsos exhibiting irregular variability . however , some sources exhibiting outbursts were also discovered . among the aperiodic sources we serendipitously detected 51 supernovae , of which 42",
    "are new discoveries .",
    "eighteen of these sn occurred during the operation of crts ( drake et al .",
    "2009 ) and other large transient surveys , such as ptf ( law et al .",
    "2009 ) and panstarrs-1 ( hodapp et al .",
    "the discovery of such a large fraction of new sn suggests that current transient surveys miss many nearby , bright supernovae .",
    "further details of the sources are given in the appendices .",
    "one possible way of measuring the utility of a periodic variable star catalog is based on its purity , accuracy and completeness .",
    "a natural expectation is that a periodic variable catalog should consist purely of stellar sources .",
    "additionally , the catalog sources should provide accurate periods , magnitudes , amplitudes , and classifications .",
    "one might also expect a level of completeness that is at minimum equivalent to other recent catalogs .      to determine the purity of our periodic variables we matched our initial candidates with sources in sdss dr10 photometry and spectroscopic catalogs ( @xmath70 radius ) . among the spectroscopic matches",
    "there were 83 different types of spectra recorded in sdss .",
    "these types can be broadly separated into stars , galaxies and qsos . in table",
    "[ tabsdsss ] , we present the number of sources with sdss photometry and spectra data among the 112,000 pre - inspection candidates and among selected sources .",
    "this table shows that a large number of the initial periodic candidates had spectra classifying them as galaxies and qsos . however , as expected , after the light curves were inspected only a few were selected as periodic variables .",
    "we reviewed the sdss spectra for the 38 objects marked as galaxies and five sources marked as qsos .",
    "28 of the spectra marked as galaxies were g and k stars that were incorrectly classified as galaxies near redshift zero .",
    "seven of the matches were due to variables blended with neighbouring faint galaxies .",
    "only three sources were actually galaxies .",
    "these objects were removed from the catalog .",
    "all five of the objects classified as qsos by sdss were systems with strong emission lines .",
    "two of the agn among these appeared to exhibit possible periodic variability , yet all were removed .",
    "the possible periodic variability of the two agn may be due to an unresolved variable superimposed on the galaxies .",
    "based on the total number of sdss spectra , the false classification rate suggests that @xmath123 ( 8/2299 ) of the objects in the catalog are likely to be galaxies or qsos .",
    "thus , from the whole catalog one might expect @xmath124 such objects . however , sdss used colour selection to choose targets for spectroscopic follow - up . within sdss - dr10",
    "more than two million spectra of galaxies and qsos have been taken , while only @xmath125 stars ( see : http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/ ) .",
    "this suggests that the spectra comprise a much more complete sample of qsos and galaxies than stars , so the number of non - stellar sources may actually be smaller .",
    "in contrast to the sdss spectroscopy , photometry has been undertaken by sdss across a large fraction of the sky irrespective of the source type .",
    "this imaging provides much greater depth and resolution than css data , as well as multi - band photometry .",
    "this makes it an ideal source for investigating even the faintest of the csdr1 variables .",
    "in order to further test the purity of our sources we matched the periodic candidates with object in the sdss dr10 photometric catalog .",
    "approximately @xmath0 28,000 of the sources from our periodic variable catalog have sdss photometry .",
    "additionally , every object in sdss is classified as either a star , a galaxy , or an object of unknown type . as with the sdss spectra",
    ", there were many sources marked as galaxies among our initial candidates .",
    "however , a moderate number ( @xmath126 ) of the objects that we classifed periodic variables were classified by sdss as galaxies .    upon inspection of the sdss images we found that the automated sdss classifications were generally incorrect .",
    "for example , 77% of the catalog sources marked as galaxies had @xmath127 .",
    "these objects were found to be stars that were saturated in sdss photometry , rather than actual galaxies .",
    "it seems likely that the saturation causes the sources to appear extended , and thus be wrongly classified as galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , in order to account for differences in the saturation limit within the five sdss photometry bands , and for variation in star colour , we examined the sdss images of all 386 objects marked as galaxies with @xmath13 .",
    "only ten of these sources were found to be galaxies .",
    "these objects were removed from the catalog .",
    "we also reviewed the sdss images for some faint variables that were marked as galaxies by sdss .",
    "in contrast to the saturated sources , almost all of the sources fainter than @xmath128 were found to be blends between close pairs or groups of stars , although , there were also a few cases where a periodic variable was blended with a galaxy .",
    "more than a dozen of the faint sources classified as galaxies based on sdss photometry had stellar sdss spectra .",
    "we found that in many cases the objects marked as galaxies had multiple epochs of sdss photometry where sources were alternatively marked as stars or galaxies , depending on seeing .",
    "based on inspection of sdss images and the photometric colour information , we find @xmath129 of the periodic catalog sources are in fact galaxies .",
    "however , since qsos are marked as stars in sdss photometry , it is likely that there is some contamination due to qsos ( as suggested by the sdss spectra above ) .",
    "we have removed all the clear galaxies and qsos from the catalog .        the international variable star index ( vsx , watson et al .",
    "2006 ) provides what is very likely the most complete catalog of known variable stars .",
    "we matched the original @xmath130 csdr1 periodic variable candidates with sources in the vsx dataset and found 6459 matches .",
    "these objects comes from 176 different classes of variable stars .",
    "this very large number of classes is due to subclasses of variables as well as sources having either multiple or uncertain classifications ( e.g. class eb|ew , signifies membership of either @xmath56 lyrae or w uma types ) .",

    "approximately @xmath131 of the strictly periodic variables ( eclipsing binaries , rr lyrae and @xmath53 scutis ) with vsx matches among our original candidates were recovered , and 93% of the periodic candidates passing our periodic candidate selection are within our final catalog . as a comparison",

    "while the vsx catalog provides a very complete set of known variables stars , it is inherently heterogeneous ( being derived from hundreds of authors using hundreds of different instruments ) .",
    "therefore , to test the accuracy of our catalog , we instead decided to compare our results with large sets of variable stars found using a single instrument .",

    "this is likely to be due to cases where the uncertainty in the measurements is comparable with the amplitude of variability . at the low - amplitude limit , the distribution of photometric measurements between 5% and 95% represents the photometric scatter , rather than the amplitude of variability .    in figure",

    "however , some sources exhibiting outbursts were also discovered .",
    "our review of periodic candidates led to the discovery of 51 variable sources exhibiting single , long , outbursts .",
    "closer inspection showed that sources were supernovae associated with galaxies seen in sdss and catalina images .",
    "nine of these objects were previously discovered sn , while the rest were new discoveries .",
    "since supernovae are clearly not periodic , their discovery among our candidates is purely serendipitous .",
    "however , this is not completely unexpected since palaversa et al .",
    "( 2013 ) discovered a supernova during their inspection of periodic variable candidates from linear data . in table",
    "[ sn ] , we present the parameters of the 42 newly discovered supernovae . among all the supernovae discovered , two have sdss spectra where some flux from the sn is seen . in one case",
    "this led to the host galaxy being classified by sdss as a qso .    to contrast these new detections with ongoing efforts to discover supernovae and other transients in the css data ,",
    "we note crts has so far discovered @xmath157 supernovae in seven years of css data .",
    "the fact that half of the new supernovae occurred during the operation of crts , but were not detected , was found to be due to their association with luminous host galaxies . in most cases , the increase in total brightness of the galaxy plus supernova is @xmath158 mags .",
    "this is insufficient for automated detection by crts ( drake et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the near future",
    ", the crts - ii project will undertake image subtraction to find such supernovae .",
    "our results suggest that the current detection rate should increase significantly .    in figure [ snlc ]",
    ", we present the light curves of four of the newly discovered supernovae .",
    "we also show the apparent brightness of these events after the flux from the host galaxy has been subtracted .",
    "in addition to supernovae , we discovered 18 new dwarf nova - type cvs .",
    "the light curves of these objects exhibit repeated outbursts . in figure",
    "[ cvlc ] , we plot two of the sources and in table [ cvtab ] , we present the details of outbursting cvs discovered during the analysis .",
    "drake et al .  ( 2013c ) found that almost all cvs discovered by crts have @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "four of the 18 new cvs covered by sdss photometry exhibit colour excess compared to drake et al .",
    "( 2013c ) .",
    "this suggests cv systems where the companion star dominates the observed flux .",
