    "inversion of the conical radon transform is relevant for emission tomography using compton cameras as proposed in @xcite .",
    "such a device measures the direction as well as the scattering angle of an incoming photon at the front of the camera .",
    "the location of the photon emission can therefore be traced back to the surface of a cone .",
    "recovering the density of the photon source therefore yields to the inversion of the conical radon transform in a natural manner .",
    "radon transforms are the theoretical foundation of many medical imaging and remote sensing application .",
    "certainly the most well known instance is the classical radon transform , which integrates a function over hyperplanes . among others ,",
    "inversion of the classical radon transform is important for classical transmission computed tomography and has been studied in many textbooks ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "closed form reconstruction formulas are known for a long time and have first been derived already in 1917 by j. radon @xcite .",
    "another radon transform that has been studied in detail more recently is the spherical radon transform .",
    "this transform integrates a function over spherical surfaces ( for some restricted centers of integration ) and is , among others , important for photo- and thermoacoustic tomography @xcite .",
    "closed form reconstruction formulas for planar and spherical center sets have been found in @xcite .",
    "the conical radon transform , on the other hand , is much less studied . in particular ,",
    "closed form reconstruction formulas have only been known for the case @xmath136 , see @xcite . in this paper we derived such reconstruction formulas for arbitrary dimension @xmath2 . for computed tomography with compton cameras @xcite ,",
    "the three dimensional case is of course the most relevant one . in this case ,",
    "our reconstruction formulas have a particularly simple structure and consist of an application of the laplacian followed by a conical back - projection .",
    "the numerical implementation seems quite straight forward following the ones of the classical or the spherical radon transform ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
