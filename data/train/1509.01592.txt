    "extra - galactic high energy transients are intense cosmological transients whose electromagnetic emission peaks in the x - ray or @xmath15-ray bands .",
    "the study of extra - galactic high - energy transients has remained an active field in astrophysics over the years .",
    "wide - field @xmath15-ray detectors dedicated to study @xmath15-ray bursts ( grbs ) have led to discoveries of other types of high - energy transients , such as supernova shock breakouts ( sbos ) and jets from tidal disruption events ( tdes ) .",
    "upcoming wide field x - ray telescopes ( e.g. einstein probe , @xcite ) are expected to significantly enlarge the sample of the known high - energy transients , and probably discover new types .",
    "grbs are the main extra - galactic @xmath15-ray transients .",
    "their durations , usually described by @xmath16 , range from milliseconds to thousands of seconds .",
    "thanks to the extensive observations led by a list of @xmath15-ray telescopes , such as _ batse _ , _ hete - ii _ , _ integral _ , _ swift _ and _ fermi _ , our understanding of grbs has been greatly advanced .",
    "two main types based on their durations are short grbs ( or sgrbs ) with @xmath17 s , and long grbs ( or lgrbs ) with @xmath18 s @xcite .",
    "observations show that these two types of grbs have distinct physical origins : massive star core collapses for lgrbs vs. compact star mergers for sgrbs ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "afterglow observations led to measurements of the redshifts of grbs , allowing one to access the energetics of these events .",
    "most lgrbs are found to have a typical isotropic luminosity ( 1-@xmath19 kev ) in the range of @xmath20 , which are called high - luminosity long grbs ( hl - lgrbs ) . a small fraction of the observed lgrbs , on the other hand",
    ", have been detected with peak luminosities less than @xmath21 .",
    "most of these events have distinct observational properties , such as long duration , smooth , single - pulse lightcurves , and are usually referred to as low - luminosity long grbs ( ll - lgrbs ) .",
    "it has also been shown that ll - lgrbs have a much higher event rate density than hl - lgrbs @xcite .",
    "more importantly , they are found to form a distinct component in the grb luminosity function @xcite , suggesting that they have a distinct physical origin .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested that at least some ll - lgrbs may be related to breakouts of trans - relativistic shocks from exploding massive stars .",
    "lacking a sensitive wide - field x - ray camera , the study of x - ray transients is only in its babyhood .",
    "nonetheless , a few types of extra - galactic x - ray transients have been discovered .",
    "tdes , bright x - ray / uv flares generated when super - massive black holes tidally disrupt stars , have been discovered from the archival x - ray survey data of the missions such as _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these transients typically last for months to years , much longer than the duration of grbs .",
    "the discovery of sw j1644 + 57 @xcite by the _ swift _ satellite suggested that some tdes can have super - eddington luminosities , which point towards a relativistic jet associated with the tde event .",
    "the discovery of a thermal component associated with the prompt emission of the ll - lgrb 060218 led to the suggestion that the signal may be related to an sbo .",
    "a serendipitous discovery of an x - ray outburst ( xro ) 080109 associated with a nearby supernova sn 2008d @xcite suggested that there are indeed high - energy transients ( even though with a much lower luminosity than ll - lgrbs ) associated with sbos . this discovery established sbos as a new type of extra - galactic high - energy transient .",
    "there are several important questions regarding these transients : what are the event rate densities of them ( i.e. how often do they occur per unit volume ) ?",
    "how do these event rate densities depend on redshift ?",
    "what are the luminosity functions of these transients ?",
    "do the luminosity functions evolve with redshift ? addressing these questions are essential to understand the progenitor systems of these transients and their cosmological evolution .",
    "a cross comparison among different transients may also shed light into possible common underlying physics behind these apparently different events .    in the literature",
    ", some studies have been carried out to address these questions for individual transients ( e.g. @xcite for both hl - lgrbs and ll - lgrbs ; @xcite for sgrbs ; @xcite for sbos ; @xcite for normal tdes ; and @xcite for jetted tdes ) . due to the small sample size of some types of these transients ,",
    "the estimates of their event rate densities are usually subject to large uncertainties .",
    "the total event rate density of a particular transient depends on the minimum luminosity and the shape of the luminosity function , which is usually not well constrained .",
    "also , the detectors sensitivity , search algorithms , as well as instrumental selection effects all introduce additional uncertainties to the problem .",
    "the calculations of the intrinsic event rate density rely on the sensitivity , field of view , and working period of the detectors . since these transients have been detected using very different detectors with different sets of parameters , special care needs to be taken in order to obtain robust results .    in order to study the evolution of luminosity functions ,",
    "one needs a large enough sample that cover a wide redshift range , with each redshift bin having enough events to construct a statistically meaningful luminosity function in the redshift bin .",
    "the x - ray transients we are studying mainly reside in the nearby universe , so that their redshift evolution , if any , can not be investigated .",
    "we therefore mainly focus on the luminosity function evolution of grbs . in the literature",
    ", there has been intense discussion about the evolution effect of the luminosity function of long grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using either a flux - limited sample or a non - parametric method @xcite to account for the truncation effect , these studies suggested that the lgrb data are consistent with having a redshift - evolving luminosity function .",
    "some papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the luminosity function is a broken power law with a universal shape ( i.e. the power law indices before and after the luminosity break ) , but the break itself has a redshift evolution in the form of @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a unified method to systematically study the redshift - dependent event rate densities and the _ global luminosity functions _",
    "( i.e. luminosity functions derived ignoring possible redshift evolution ) of several known extra - galactic high - energy transients . for grbs ,",
    "thanks to their large sample size , we also investigate their luminosity function evolution . compared with previous studies , our analysis has a larger sample for most transients ( especially for ll - lgrbs , and tdes ) , and more interestingly , we will derive the global event rate density distributions of _ all transients _ for the first time . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the general methodology of calculating the event rate density and the luminosity function of any type of transient .",
    "we then introduce redshift distributions of various transients in section 3 , especially the new empirical models for short grbs and tdes .",
    "in section 4 , we describe our data of all extra - galactic high energy transients .",
    "the results for individual events are presented in section 5.1 ( lgrbs ) , 5.2 ( sgrbs ) 5.3 ( sbos ) , and 5.4 ( tdes ) , respectively . in 5.5 , we present the global distribution of the luminosity functions of all the transients .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 6 with some discussion . throughout the paper , the concordance cosmological parameters presented by the planck collaboration , i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are adopted @xcite .",
    "quantifying the redshift - dependent event rate density and luminosity function of a certain type of transient is a challenging task .",
    "the observed events and their redshift and luminosity distributions are the results of the convolution of both ( likely redshift - dependent ) luminosity function and intrinsic redshift distribution of the events , with the proper correction of the instrumental sensitivity threshold , field of view , and operational time .",
    "all these complications may be disentangled with a large enough observational sample .",
    "however , for most transients discussed in this paper ( except grbs ) , the number of observational sample is too small to perform such a task . in order to cross - comparing various types of transients ,",
    "in this paper , we first ignore the possible redshift - evolution of the luminosity functions of all the transients and use the data to construct luminosity functions of each type of transients .",
    "this allows us to separate luminosity function and redshift distribution @xmath27 . in principle , the luminosity function could be redshift - dependent .",
    "for example , for long grbs for which we have collected a large enough sample , evidence of such an evolution effect has been collected . as a result",
    ", the luminosity function we construct in this paper only carries the meaning in the `` global '' sense .",
    "we hereby define all the luminosity functions constructed without considering redshift evolution as _ global luminosity functions _ ( glf ) . in order to use the data to construct the glf",
    ", we also assume that the events with a same luminosity share the same other properties ( e.g. spectral properties and detector parameters ) .",
    "this makes the observed events good indicators of the underlying general population .",
    "also , since there is a wide range of the spectral peak energy ( @xmath28 ) distribution for different transients studied in this paper , we try as much as possible to apply the @xmath29-corrected bolometric luminosity ( @xmath30 ) using the measured spectral properties of the transients ( eq.([eq : k1 ] ) ) .",
    "the only exceptions are the tdes detected by _",
    "rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _",
    "whose narrow bandpass does not allow a precise inference of the global spectral parameters .",

    "the detected number of events in the luminosity interval from @xmath36 to @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 the dimensionless function @xmath27 describes the redshift - dependent event rate density , i.e. @xmath40 the redshift - dependent specific comoving volume reads ( for the standard @xmath41cdm cosmology ) @xmath42^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] for a particular @xmath32 , the maximum redshift @xmath43 , which defines the maximum volume inside which an event with luminosity @xmath32 can be detected , can be defined by the sensitivity threshold @xmath44 via @xmath45 where @xmath29 is a correction factor , which corrects the observed flux in the detector s energy band ( @xmath46 ) to a wide band in the rest frame ( e.g. @xmath47 kev for grbs , see eq.([eq : kdf ] ) ) .    technically , it is easier to evaluate numbers in the logarithmic luminosity bins .",

    "grbs have a large enough sample to study the redshift evolution effect .",
    "we investigate the evolution effect for lgrbs and sgrbs separately . for each class",

    "practically , for a redshift bin @xmath77 around a certain redshift @xmath78 , we change the integration limits in eq.(2 ) to @xmath79 and min@xmath80 , respectively , and repeat the procedure laid out in section 2.1 .",

    "the redshift of an event is needed .",
    "for grbs , not all events have redshift measurements . in order to properly account for their event rate density",
    ", one needs to correct the derived values based on the @xmath78-known sample by the ratio between the total number and the @xmath78-known event number . for hl - lgrbs and sgrbs",
    ", this correction factor is approximately 3 , and we adopt it in our derivations .",
    "the detected rates also depend on the detector s spectral window . for grbs , _ batse _",
    "observations suggested that the short - to - long ratio is about 1:3 @xcite , whereas _",
    "swift _ bat , which has a softer bandpass , only gets a 1:10 ratio @xcite . since _",
    "swift _ can essentially detect all _ batse _ lgrbs , one needs to correct for the _ swift_-detected sgrbs by another factor of @xmath88 for the inferred sgrb event rate density .",
    "this factor has been taken into account in our derivations .",
    "for the other types of transients , the samples are not large enough to access whether we have missed some events due to the imperfect instrumental spectral window or the lack of redshift measurements .",
    "we therefore derive the event rate density using the observed events only .",

    "table [ tab : instruments ] lists the three parameters of the high - energy detectors used to study various high - energy transients discussed in this paper . while the first two parameters are straightforwardly defined , the definitions of sensitivity thresholds are non - trivial .",

    "the threshold flux depends on the trigger duration @xmath99 , with the dependence @xmath100 .",
    "the trigger duration of grb 060218 was about 80 s , with a mean flux of @xmath101 ( t. sakamoto , 2015 , private communication ) .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a threshold flux @xmath102 which we adopt to also calculate the threshold flux for other image trigger events .",
    "the trigger duration of grb 100316d is 64 s. the two jetted tde events sw j1644 + 57 and sw j2058 + 05 had a trigger duration of 64s @xcite and 4d @xcite , respectively , and the corresponding @xmath44 are used to derive @xmath64 of jetted tdes .",

    "the latter are only observed in the nearby universe , so that the modification at high-@xmath78 does not enter the problem .      unlike long grbs , most short grbs do not directly trace star formation history .",
    "observations suggest that most short grbs are consistent with having an origin not related to massive star deaths .",
    "the leading scenario is mergers of double compact star systems , e.g. two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) or a neutron star and a black hole ( ns - bh ) ( @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review ) .    in order to have a merger to occur",
    ", a compact star binary system needs to go through a long inspiral phase defined by energy loss of the system through gravitational wave radiation .",
    "the redshift distribution of sgrbs therefore needs to account for an additional time delay due to inspiral with respect to the creation of the compact binary system , which itself traces the sfh .",

    "later , several more tdes have been detected from rass , namely rx j1242 , rx j1624 , rx j1420 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the recent decade , more tde candidates have been discovered by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , mostly by comparising survey catalogs with the archival data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as by serendipitous detections @xcite .",

    "however , it remains unknown whether two types of tdes are indeed intrinsically different from others , and if so , what could be the main reason to make the difference . by measuring the spin parameter of the central black holes of the two _ swift _ tdes within the theoretical framework of the blandford - znajek mechanism",

    "only two events may have been detected both in the rising and declining phases , so that the peak luminosity was measured @xcite . for other tdes , one did not detect the sources in both the rising and the declining phases , so that the peak luminosity can not be well constrained .",
    "the maximum luminosity during the detected phase is only the lower limit of the peak luminosity .",
    "however , since the lightcurve peak is rounded and spreads in several weeks @xcite , the observed peak luminosity may not be too different from the true peak luminosity .    due to the narrow bandpass of the x - ray telescopes that detect tdes , the spectral shape for tdes is not well constrained .",
    "except for the bat detected tdes for which a treatment similar to grbs can be applied , for the majority of tdes , we only apply an empirical relation to estimate the bolometric luminosity by multiplying x - ray luminosity by a factor of 1.4 , i.e. @xcite @xmath168 for swift tdes , a power - law spectrum in the bat band is reported for both events with a photon index of 1.8 and 1.6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "even though the spectrum of jetted tdes is not known , we speculate that they have a non - thermal spectrum with @xmath169 not far above the bat band . as a result",
    ", we apply eq.([eq : ep - gamma ] ) to estimate @xmath169 and apply eq.([eq : kdf ] ) to estimate the @xmath29-correction factor assuming the standard band - function parameters for the spectrum .",
    "this led to a @xmath29-correction factor 2.1 , and 2.2 for sw j1644 + 57 and sw j2058 + 05 , respectively .",
    "since lgrbs and sgrbs have different physical origins ( massive star core collapse vs. compact star mergers ) , we derive their event rate density and luminosity function separately . for each type",

    "the ll - lgrbs are not the straightforward extension of hl - lgrbs to low luminosities . but",
    "the slope of ll - lgrb is similar to that of first component of hl - lgrbs .",
    "the normalization of ll - lgrbs is a little bit lower as we apply a lower threshold for ll - lgrbs than hl - lgrbs .",
    "therefore it may be possible that ll - lgrbs follow the extension of lf of hl - lgrbs if we take a tpl fit to the joint ll- and hl- samples .",

    "this is similar to the tpl fit to hl - lgrbs alone except for a slightly shallower @xmath67 , which is compromised by the slight mis - match between ll - lgrbs and hl - lgrbs .",
    "the tpl nature of the joint glf for lgrbs is interesting .",

    "further more , the pl indices @xmath67 and @xmath68 also show significant evolutions ( variations ) in different redshift bins . since different redshift bins have different @xmath209 , and since the behavior below @xmath209 is poorly constrained by the data , in table [ tab : lfapp ] we choose different @xmath209 for different redshift bins . for nearby universe",
    ", we also get a @xmath210 at higher @xmath209 .",
    "we obtain a consistency of @xmath210 derived from data from different redshift interval .",
    "to minimize the truncation effect by the flux limit of detectors , we also use a sub - sample with a higher threshold ( with peak photon flux larger than 1.8@xmath84 ) , see fig.[fig : lf2 ] .",
    "the sub - sample consists less grbs in some redshift intervals ( e.g. @xmath211 ) so that the luminosity function can be fit by a spl .",

    "it is also different from @xcite , who claimed a bpl luminosity function .",
    "one caveat of our treatment is the assumption that all sgrbs are of a compact star merger ( type i ) origin . in the _ swift _ era , @xcite first suspected that some high-@xmath32 sgrbs at high redshifts may not be of the type i origin , but may rather originate from massive star core collapse ( type ii ) .",
    "they suggested to apply multi - wavelength criteria ( instead of using @xmath15-ray duration only ) to judge the physical origin of a grb .",
    "later @xcite pointed out that the assumption that all sgrbs are of the compact star merger origin ( type i ) is disfavored since one can not simultaneously account for the @xmath221 two - dimensional distribution and the @xmath222 distribution of sgrbs .",
    "they claimed that a good fraction of sgrbs may be of a type ii origin .",
    "@xcite recently reached the similar conclusion using a different argument based on the duration distribution of grbs .",

    "we did not exclude any sgrb from our sample for the following reason .",
    "we believe that any conclusion about the physical category of a sgrb based on the duration information only ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not reliable .",
    "rather one should consider multi - wavelength criteria @xcite , especially the host galaxy type and the afterglow location within the host .",
    "host galaxy studies of sgrbs @xcite suggested that the hypothesis that all sgrbs belong to the compact star merger ( type i ) category is not in conflict with the data .",
    "indeed , some sgrbs excluded by @xcite ( defined by them as collapsars ) actually have large offsets from host galaxies , fully consistent with being due to a compact star merger origin ( e.g. grb 070724 with offset @xmath223 kpc , and grb 070809 with offsef @xmath224 kpc , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a recent study of sgrb emission amplitude parameter @xcite also suggested that most observed sgrbs are not disguised sgrbs due to the `` tip - of - iceberg '' effect .",
    "even though we believe that there exists a contamination type ii grbs in the sgrb sample , without studying the multi - wavelength data of sgrbs in detail , we believe that it is more appropriate not to exclude any sgrb in this study .      for short grbs that have much less data ,",
    "it is more difficult to study the possible evolution effect of luminosity function .",
    "we manage to divide the short grb sample into three redshift bins ( @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 ) , and apply the method in section [ sec : evolution ] to derive @xmath228 using the data in different redshift bins .",

    "the glf of tdes ( including both normal tdes and jetted tdes ) can be roughly described by a single pl with @xmath249 . with the current sample , the jetted tdes detected by _ swift _",
    "seem to lie in the extension of normal tde luminosity function to high - luminosities .",
    "the event rate density of sw j1644 + 57 shows a flattening feature at the highest luminosity .",

    ": glb ] , we plot all high - energy transients in one figure .",
    "the left panel shows the local event rate density above a certain luminosity ( @xmath250 ) as a function of @xmath32 , and the right pabel presents the specific local event rate density ( @xmath64 ) , which essentially represents the glf .",
    "all the data points are given a @xmath251 error in vertical axis .",
    "the width of luminosity bin is shown as the horizontal error bar .",
    "intriguingly , all the transients seem to line up to form a rough single power law distribution .",
    "a best fit to the glfs of all the transients gives a slope of @xmath252 .",
    "all the events lie within the @xmath253 confidence bounds of the best fit .",
    "the region below this correlation line is likely due to an observational bias , and could be filled with new types of transients . with a much lower event rate density , these transients may not have been detected within the time span of the modern high - energy astronomy .",
    "the region above the correlation line , on the other hand , is not subject to selection effects and must be intrinsic .",
    "the existence of such an upper boundary of high - energy transients is intriguing , which may be rooted from more profound physical reasons .",
    "in this paper , we systematically investigated the local event rate density , redshift evolution , and glf of several known extra - galactic high - energy ( @xmath15-ray and x - ray ) transients , including high - luminosity and low - luminosity long grbs that have a massive - star core - collapse origin , short grbs that likely have a compact star merger origin , supernova shock breakouts , and tidal disruption events of stars by super - massive black holes .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "* for all types of transients , the glfs are typically well described by a single power law , although that of hl - lgrbs demands a triple power law . *",
    "the local event rate density of each type of transient depends on the minimum luminosity . for grbs , we get @xmath254 @xmath234 for @xmath255 @xmath256 for ll - lgrbs ; @xmath257 @xmath234 with @xmath258 @xmath256 ) for hl - lgrbs , and @xmath259 @xmath234 for sgrbs , with @xmath260 @xmath256 for the gaussian , log - normal and power law merger delay models , respectively . even though with two confirmed cases , the sbos have event rate densities cover a wide range , from @xmath233 @xmath234 for xro 080109/sn 2008d - like events ( luminosty @xmath235 ) to @xmath261 @xmath234 for grb 060218/sn 2006aj - like events ( luminosity @xmath237 ) .",
    "the event rate density of tdes also covers a wide range , from @xmath262 @xmath263 with @xmath264 @xmath256 for normal tdes to @xmath265 @xmath263 above @xmath266 @xmath256 for jetted tdes detected by _",
    "swift_. * for grbs , we confirmed the previous work @xcite that ll - lgrbs still do not straightforwardly follow the extension from hl - lgrbs .",
    "however , a tpl fit to the entire lgrb population suggests that the steeper glf slope in the low - energy end now extends to a much higher luminosity , so that ll- and hl - lgrbs are no longer clearly separated .",
    "consider the glf shape in the high-@xmath32 end , the indices ( @xmath267 ) and the break luminosity ( @xmath268 ) are generally consistent with ( even though not identical to ) what was found in previous work @xcite . for sgrbs , we found a spl luminosity function with @xmath269 , in contrast with the bpl distribution found by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy may lie in different sample selection criteria : whereas @xcite excluded about 1/3 of sgrbs , we included all the sgrbs in our analysis .",
    "* we confirm the conclusion of previous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the luminosity function of lgrbs likely evolve with redshift .",
    "however , we find that the evolution can not be easily quantified with a simple analytical model . nonetheless ,",
    "if one assumes that shape of the lf does not change and only the break luminosity evolves with redshift , the consistent results as previous authors can be achieved . *",
    "sbos and ll - lgrbs have a similar index @xmath270 , supporting the idea that ll - lgrbs may be related to shock breakouts @xcite . *",
    "the global luminosity function of tdes is consistent with a single power law with @xmath271 .",
    "the jetted tdes discovered by swift seem to be consistent with the extension of normal tdes to high - luminosty regime , even though a flattening feature is seen .",
    "more data are needed to judge whether jetted tdes form a new component in the glf . * intriguingly , all the high - energy transients are consistent with having a global single power - law distribution of glfs with a slope 1.6 .",
    "even though there could exist transients below the line which have not been discovered , the lack of events above the line is real .",
    "the existence of such an upper boundary is intriguing , and its physical origin is unknown . * to perform this analysis , we adopted / derived the redshift distribution factor @xmath27 of various types of transients based on different models . for lgrbs and sbos , we assume that the event rate density traces the sfh , and adopt the empirical model ( eq.([eq : sfh ] ) ) of @xcite . for sgrbs , through monte carlo simulations",
    ", we derived empirical @xmath27 functions for three merger delay models : eqs.([eq : gaussian ] ) , ( [ eq : ln ] ) , and ( [ eq : pl ] ) for the gaussian , log - normal , and power - law , respectively . for tdes , we assume that the event rate is constant within each galaxy , and derived an empirical formula of @xmath27 ( eq.([eq : tde ] ) ) based on the black hole number density evolution following @xcite . these empirical formulae can be directly used in the future .",
    "this paper focuses on high - energy transients only , serving as a reference for the wide - field @xmath15-ray astronomy and the upcoming wide - field x - ray astronomy ( led by e.g. einstein probe , @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that the phenomenology of all the transients studied in this paper extends to lower frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "for example , grbs have multi - wavelength afterglows .",
    "sbos can peak in the uv or even optical band if the progenitor star is large enough .",
    "uv and optical tdes and radio counterparts of jetted tdes have been discovered .",
    "the study of high - energy transients in the low - frequency domain is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "<S> several types of extra - galactic high - energy transients have been discovered , which include high - luminosity and low - luminosity long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , short - duration grbs , supernova shock breakouts ( sbos ) , and tidal disruption events ( tdes ) without or with an associated relativistic jet . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we apply a unified method to systematically study the redshift - dependent event rate densities and the global luminosity functions ( ignoring redshift evolution ) of these transients . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce some empirical formulae for the redshift - dependent event rate densities for different types of transients , and derive the local specific event rate density , which also represents its global luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> long grbs have a large enough sample to reveal features in the global luminosity function , which is best characterized as a triple power law . </S>",
    "<S> all the other transients are consistent with having a single power law luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the total event rate density depends on the minimum luminosity , and we obtain the following values in units of @xmath0 : @xmath1 for high - luminosity long grbs above @xmath2 ; @xmath3 for low - luminosity long grbs above @xmath4 ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 above @xmath8 for short grbs with three different merger delay models ( gaussian , log - normal , and power law ) ; @xmath9 above @xmath10 for sbos , @xmath11 for normal tdes above @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 above @xmath14 for tde jets as discovered by _ </S>",
    "<S> swift_. intriguingly , the global luminosity functions of different kinds of transients , which cover over 12 orders of magnitude , are consistent with a single power law with an index of -1.6 . </S>"
