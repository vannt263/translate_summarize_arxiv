    "the electron beam filamentation instability ( fi ) generates magnetic fields in energetic astrophysical and solar flare plasmas @xcite .",
    "the fi is also relevant for inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite and laboratory astrophysics @xcite experiments , as well as for particle accelerators @xcite .",
    "the fi is driven by counter - propagating electron beams and it feeds on their mean flow energy .",
    "this contrasts the weibel instability , which grows magnetic fields at the expense of a thermal anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the weibel instability and the fi can be combined to form cumulative instabilities @xcite . the fi becomes important , if the beam speeds are at least mildly relativistic .",
    "the growth and saturation of the fi can be modelled with particle - in - cell ( pic ) or vlasov codes .",
    "the fi has been investigated with a one - dimensional ( 1d ) vlasov code @xcite and with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) pic code @xcite , taking into account the ion dynamics .",
    "the impact of a flow - aligned magnetic field has been examined in ref .",
    "pic simulation studies have addressed the statistical properties of the fi in 1d @xcite and in 2d @xcite .",
    "the counterstreaming electron instability has also been examined with 3d pic simulations @xcite .",
    "the probably simplest and thus widely researched plasma configuration that gives rise to the fi consists of equally dense and equally warm electron beams that have a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "their thermal velocity spread @xmath0 in the rest frame of the respective beam is the same in all directions .",
    "this system can be considered in a simulation reference frame , in which both beams move into opposite directions at the non - relativistic speed modulus @xmath1 and with @xmath2 .",
    "the fi can be isolated by selecting a 1d or 2d simulation box , that is oriented orthogonally to the beam velocity vector @xmath3 .",
    "the electron velocities must be resolved in the simulation direction or plane and along the beam direction .",
    "the fi competes in reality with the two - stream modes and it can probably not be observed experimentally in an isolated form , even if the equal beam densities favor the fi over the two - stream instability @xcite .",
    "however , the gained insight into the development of the isolated fi will improve the understanding of systems , in which the fi interplays with other instabilities .",
    "the linear and nonlinear evolution of the fi driven by counter - propagating identical electron beams is qualitatively understood , at least in one spatial dimension where the filament mergers are suppressed @xcite .",
    "the refs . @xcite have provided an insight into its linear and nonlinear development , which can be summarized as follows .",
    "the fi triggers the aperiodic growth of waves out of an initial perturbation ( noise ) with the wavevectors @xmath4 over a wide band of @xmath5 , where the wavenumbers @xmath6 are of the order of the inverse electron skin depth .",
    "the electrons are deflected by the magnetic field perturbation , and electrons moving in opposite directions separate in space .",
    "the net current of these flow channels amplifies the initial perturbation and , thus , the tendency to form current channels .",
    "the magnetic field amplitude grows exponentially .",
    "magnetic trapping has been identified as a possible saturation mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed @xcite that the electrostatic fields , which grow during the nonlinear evolution of the fi , may be important for the saturation .",
    "these electrostatic fields have been related to the magnetic pressure gradient @xcite .",
    "however , it has not yet been demonstrated quantitatively that the electrostatic fields during the quasi - linear evolution of the fi do originate from the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "a direct comparison of the relative importance of the electric and magnetic fields for the nonlinear saturation of the fi is also lacking and this is an objective of this paper .",
    "the length of the 1d simulation box with periodic boundaries can be selected such , that only one wave period grows .",
    "this fi evolves like that in a much larger box @xcite and the saturation mechanism should thus be the same .",
    "we employ here a simulation box that resolves a single spatial period of the growing wave and we can thus compare our results to previous work @xcite .",
    "we employ plasma parameters that are identical to those in ref .",
    "@xcite and resort to the distribution of the filament sizes , which is computed in that paper .",
    "we perform three simulations , in which we vary the box length .",
    "the spectrum of unstable wavenumbers of the fi is bounded at low and large wavenumbers , the latter by thermal effects @xcite .",
    "the bounded @xmath6-spectrum implies in turn a maximum and a minimum filament size .",
    "we model a filament size close to the minimum value , one close to the maximum value and one , that is close to the size with the maximum probability .",
    "we compare the properties of the filaments .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the pic code and the initial conditions .",
    "the results are presented in the section 3 .",
    "all simulations demonstrate that the electrons are heated up orthogonally to @xmath3 , in line with previous simulations @xcite .",
    "the heating is achieved by the simultaneous interaction of the electrons with the quasi - static magnetic field and the oscillatory electrostatic fields .",
    "the heating is much stronger for the larger filaments than for the small one .",
    "the magnetic field amplitude reaches a value that is in reasonable agreement with the one expected from the magnetic trapping mechanism .",
    "it does , however , not scale correctly with the filament size .",
    "a reason is that the electrostatic field modifies the potential .",
    "the force excerted by the electrostatic field in the simulation of the least turbulent small filament oscillates around a mean value that equals the magnetic pressure gradient force , confirming experimentally their connection .",
    "the fields of the two larger filaments show the same spatial correlation .",
    "the heated electrons can not be confined by the electromagnetic field but a cooler , dense electron population remains localized , forming a plasmon .",
    "this plasmon can propagate at a sizeable fraction of the initial electron thermal speed , which contrasts the non - propagating filamentation modes out of which the plasmon forms .",
    "the plasmon maintains the net current along @xmath3 and , thus , the magnetic field . the slow extraordinary mode is pumped in the two large simulation boxes .",
    "however , the resulting growth of the discrete wave spectrum observed here , which has been reported first by ref .",
    "@xcite , is a finite box effect .",
    "the results are discussed in more detail in section 4 .",
    "the particle - in - cell simulation method is detailed in ref .",

    "a pic code approximates a phase space fluid by an ensemble of computational particles ( cps ) .",
    "the cps can have a mass @xmath7 and charge @xmath8 that differs from the physical particle it represents , but the charge - to - mass ratio must be preserved . the equations , which the pic code is solving , are @xmath9   + \\mathbf{v}_{cp } \\times \\mathbf{b}[\\mathbf{x}_{cp } ] \\right ) \\ , , \\ , \\ ,   \\frac{d}{dt } \\mathbf{x}_{cp } = \\mathbf{v}_{cp},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite , that it is not the magnetic trapping but the electrostatic fields that quench the instability .",
    "this is , because the bouncing frequency of electrons depends on the strength of the flow - aligned magnetic field , while the electrostatic field does not ; the pressure gradient of a uniform magnetic field vanishes and leaves unchanged the electrostatic field .",
    "the electron beams in our simulations have been equally dense and cool .",
    "the beams counter - propagated at a non - relativistic speed orthogonally to the simulation direction . picking a box length comparable to the filament size has allowed us to obtain a quasi - monochromatic wave spectrum and one pair of filaments .",
    "we have demonstrated quantitatively , that the electrostatic field is indeed driven by the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "the initial conditions we have used here do not represent a steady state and the saturated plasma oscillates around its equilibrium state .",
    "the amplitude of the electrostatic field oscillates around the mean value , which is expected from the magnetic pressure gradient . we have demonstrated this for the small filament .",

    "the electrostatic field oscillates in space twice as fast as the magnetic one .",
    "its effect is to reduce the force on the electrons close to the equilibrium point of the respective filament and to increase it farther away from it .",
    "the effective potential obtained from a summation of the magnetic pressure - driven electrostatic field and of the drift electric field is thus not a cosine .",
    "the electrons can move almost freely through the potential well and are reflected at a relatively thin layer , as we have demonstrated for two representative computational particles .",
    "the effective potential is not symmetric with respect to both filaments .",
    "this is , because the drift electric field depends on the beam flow direction , while the magnetic pressure - driven electric field acts on all electrons the same way .",
    "the wall of the potential that is confining one filament is located well inside the potential well of the second filament .",
    "filaments thus remain only separated if they have opposite beam flow directions , through which they can overlap without merging .",
    "this effective potential will also accelerate ions @xcite .",
    "this ion acceleration is , however , exaggerated in 1d simulations where the potential is stationary in space .",
    "the filaments merge in higher - dimensional simulations and the potentials are not longer stationary .",
    "we have thus deliberately omitted to consider ion effects .",
    "the electrons are heated up when the potential grows and also by their simultaneous interaction with the oscillatory electric field and the steady magnetic field .",
    "a dense and spatially confined electron population ( plasmon ) maintains the current responsible for the magnetic field after the heating has taken place .",
    "a hot electron population overcomes the potential well and presumably contributes to the quenching of the fi , which can be suppressed by a high temperature orthogonal to the beam flow direction @xcite .",
    "we have then assessed the impact of the filament size on its dynamics .",
    "the probability distribution for the filament size has been sampled using a long one - dimensional simulation box in ref .",
    "we have examined here two other filaments , the size of which we have selected according to the probability distribution .",
    "the size of the medium filament is close to the most common size .",
    "the large filament has a size close to the maximum observed one .",
    "larger filaments can only form , if filaments merge in higher - dimensional systems @xcite because the growth rate of the fi decreases , as we go to smaller wavenumbers .",
    "long waves are then outgrown by shorter waves .",
    "the electrostatic fields of the medium and the large filament have been correlated with the magnetic field after the fi has saturated and they have oscillated around an equilibrium value .",
    "this equilibrium value is close to the magnetic pressure gradient - driven field , as for the small filament .",
    "we have not shown it , because the fit is not as accurate as for the small filament , due to the drift of the structure and the increased levels of turbulence .",
    "the sub - structure , i.e. the merging of smaller filaments in the large filament , prior to the saturation of the fi has furthermore prevented a clear correlation of the electrostatic with the magnetic field at the saturation time .",
    "both the medium and large filaments propagated after they have saturated , even though the phase speed of the waves driven by the fi is zero .",
    "the speed has , however , been less than the initial beam thermal speed .",
    "a filament can be accelerated by the saturation of the fi .",
    "any net momentum of the hot and untrapped electron population must be balanced by an oppositely directed net momentum of the trapped electrons .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are tied to the trapped electrons and convect with the plasmons .",
    "the direction of the convection is random .",
    "the movie in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that different convection speeds of neighboring filaments result in their spatial oscillation rather than in a convection .",
    "the mean momentum along the beam flow direction has been spatially modulated .",
    "our comparative study of three filament sizes has shown that the magnetic field amplitude and the electrostatic field amplitude both increase with the filament size .",
    "they modulate the mean velocity of the beam through the @xmath195-force .",
    "this modulation thus increases with the filament size , explaining the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite that trapped electrons reach increasingly higher speeds as the filaments merge .",
    "the magnetic field has varied linearly in space over wide spatial intervals in all case studies . a magnetic field amplitude with a constant gradient results also in a magnetic pressure - driven electric field with a constant gradient .",
    "the fourier transform over space of a curve with a constant gradient results in a power - law spectrum .",
    "this is observed also in longer- and in higher - dimensional simulation boxes @xcite .",
    "we have examined the electric field component along the beam flow direction .",
    "its wavenumber , the phase shift relative to the magnetic field and that it grows during the linear phase of the fi implies that it is driven through ampere s law .",
    "these low - frequency oscillations are transient modes and they damp out . however , we have confirmed here a previous observation @xcite , that the fast extraordinary mode is pumped by this wave component .",
    "we could observe this only for the two large filaments .",
