    "without question , some of the most exciting results that have been observed in the study of relativistic heavy - ion collisions in the rhic era have been in the area of processes with large momentum transfers .",
    "all collaborations observed evidence of large _ final state _ suppression of the inclusive yield of charged hadrons at high transverse momenta ( ) in central collisions @xcite , by as much as a factor of 5 .",
    "the study of azimuthal correlations demonstrated that the suppression mainly affects hadrons found in the away - side of the leading particle in the event @xcite , and that this suppression was not present in  collisions .",
    "the consensus reached around these observations was that rhic produces extremely dense matter ( @xmath5 times higher than ground - state nuclei ) , and the suppression patterns were the result of induced gluon radiation as fast partons traversed this dense medium @xcite .",
    "the focus for the last two years of rhic research in this area has been the quantitative determination of the properties of the produced matter , _",
    "e.g. _  its density , temperature and viscosity .",
    "reliable estimations of these is the current challenge of the heavy - ion program . to determine the density quantitatively , the inclusive suppression was the first observable used to compare to theory , but in essentially all theoretical descriptions the level of suppression in the range @xmath6 shows a saturation with increasing density , ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) , so further information is needed to constrain the models .",
    "several measurements can provide further clues .",
    "first , to complete a systematic study of di - hadron correlations .",
    "second , to use heavy quarks as probes , given that they are expected to couple less strongly to the medium . finally , to measure photon - jet correlations to vary the geometry bias compared to di - hadron correlations .",
    "together , the study of di - hadron correlations , heavy quarks and @xmath4-jet measurements should provide sufficient sensitivity to quantitatively determine the density of the medium .",
    "we discuss now the results relevant to these probes presented at this conference by star .",
    "the summary of results for identified spectra at lower momenta , strangeness , azimuthal anisotropy and three - particle correlations is presented in ref .",
    "the interest in a systematic study of di - hadron correlations stems from the need to better understand the interaction of fast partons with the bulk of the produced medium .",
    "it is established that the away - side particles are strongly modified by the dense matter , leading to suppression of the yields @xcite .",
    "the observation of broad away - side correlations at low @xcite make clear that lowering the  is also necessary to fully understand the system .",
    "previous results on di - hadron @xmath7 correlations used untriggered particles with @xmath8@xcite . at intermediate , the observation of dip - hump structures in the away - side correlation functions @xcite have generated much interest and speculation as to the nature of the medium response to a fast parton . at high , clear di - jet signals",
    "are observed @xcite and the use of di - hadron fragmentation functions has been proposed as an additional tool for quantitative comparison to energy - loss phenomenology .",
    "we now aim to map the angular correlation panorama , extending the @xmath7 measurements using triggered hadrons with @xmath9 @xcite , forward - to- mid - rapidity @xmath1 correlations , @xcite , and extending previous @xmath1 correlation and di - hadron fragmentation measurements to study the systematics@xcite .",
    "we first summarize results from the @xmath10 correlation analysis at mid - rapidity ( @xmath11 ) . at low- , there are already quantitative measurements @xcite of the number and  correlation in @xmath7 which show a @xmath1 elongation of the 2-d number correlation in  collisions , and an @xmath0 elongation ( both in number and  correlations ) in for @xmath8 .",
    "the results presented here extend the reach to the region @xmath12 and @xmath13 , using the trigger - associated technique @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta - phicorrelations](left ) , presents the @xmath14 correlation , choosing tracks with @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the 10% most central events .",
    "we note the @xmath17 elliptic flow modulation in the azimuth - difference axis , and for the region near @xmath18 an @xmath0 correlation that is present throughout the @xmath0 acceptance of the star tpc .",
    "the correlation shows a maximum in the region near @xmath19 . to quantitatively study the yields as a function of centrality and of the  and  kinematics",
    ", we employed the following ansatz .",
    "we divide the correlation yield into two components .",
    "the first component is constructed to resemble a jet - like correlation .",
    "we do this in three different ways .",
    "one is to choose two disconnected regions in @xmath20 , a region away from the maximum ( @xmath21 ) and a region near the maximum ( @xmath22 ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details and examples ) . subtracting the former from the latter ,",
    "we obtain a component that we label the `` jet''-like correlation @xmath23 , borrowing from the picture of a qcd jet fragmenting into hadrons .",
    "the yield remainder in the region @xmath24 we label the `` ridge''-like correlation , due to the obvious shape .",
    "while this decomposition is instructive to produce quantitative measurements of the yields _ vs. _  centrality and _ vs. _  the kinematics , it should be noted that this does not imply that the ridge - like correlation is unrelated to jet - fragmentation phenomena .",
    "once we use the decomposition into the `` jet '' ( @xmath25 ) and the `` ridge '' ( @xmath26 ) , we can study the yields .",
    "we find the total yield ( @xmath27 ) increases linearly as a function of , but after removing the ridge yield @xmath26 , the remainder @xmath25 yield is independent of centrality ( see @xcite ) .",
    "focusing on central collisions , fig.[fig : eta - phicorrelations](right ) shows the yield in varying bins of  for windows of  for the @xmath25 component ( open symbols ) and the @xmath26 component ( filled symbols ) .",
    "we fit an exponential to each resulting  spectrum ; dashed lines for the @xmath25 spectra and solid lines for the @xmath26 spectra . for reference , the inclusive spectrum is shown ( stars ) .",
    "we observe that the @xmath26 spectra have similar slopes to the inclusive spectra , and the overall shape and yields are independent of @xmath28 within our uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath25 spectra are all harder than the inclusive , and a clear correlation is seen between the slope and yield of the @xmath25 spectrum and the choice of .",
    "r[0.01]0pt     studies on @xmath29 correlations can now benefit from the knowledge of this elongated @xmath20 structure in the near - side .",
    "figure [ fig : ztdistributions ] shows the result of applying the @xmath27 ansatz to the near - side di - hadron fragmentation functions _",
    "vs._@xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ztdistributions]a ) shows the  -triggered di - hadron fragmentation functions _ vs. _  for various windows in .",
    "the top - middle panel shows the same study for , where the  dependence of the  data has a similar shape for all choices of .",
    "panel d ) shows the ratio of the  spectra in  to that in .",
    "all  spectra have similar slopes in  compared to , but the yields are larger in  for lower . removing the @xmath26 component , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztdistributions]c ) , we find the remaining particles behave just like : fig .  [",
    "fig : ztdistributions]e ) shows the ratio of the @xmath26 removed  spectra in  to the spectrum , seen to be close to unity within our uncertainties for all  windows .",
    "this is suggestive that the @xmath25 component might be indicative of vacuum fragmentation after energy loss .",
    "together with the quantitative study of the low-  number and correlations , these measurements should provide a reference against which models attempting to constrain the density of the medium can be compared .",
    "the trigger - associated correlation technique has been extended to use electron triggers .",
    "experimentally , measurements of the non - photonic electron spectra are used as a proxy for heavy quarks .",
    "these show a rather large amount of suppression@xcite in , much larger than initial calculations of heavy - quark energy loss predicted@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of energy loss for heavy quarks was reassessed , with the conclusion that collisional energy loss is important@xcite .",
    "r[0.01]0pt     nevertheless , the calculations were still not able to reproduce the level of suppression measured for the non - photonic electrons .",
    "since the measurement is sensitive to the sum of the @xmath31 and @xmath2 quark contributions , it was also noted that if the @xmath2-quark contribution was modified ( and in the extreme case , _ ignored _ ) the calculations were consistent with the measurement .",
    "therefore , an urgent need arose for disentangling the relative contributions of @xmath31 and @xmath2 quarks to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "we present here the first results from a method to extract the @xmath2 contribution to the non - photonic electrons via the analysis of @xmath32 correlations in  collisions .",
    "the method exploits the correlation between the electron and hadron that originate from the semi - leptonic decay of a heavy - quark .",
    "the larger mass of the @xmath33 meson results in a larger energy given to the decay products , which results in a broader near - side @xmath32 correlation compared to that resulting from the semi - leptonic decay of a @xmath34 meson . we have simulated",
    "the resulting @xmath32 correlation shapes using pythia , which introduces a model - dependence into the method .",
    "the model - dependence is small however : varying the underlying fragmentation functions we find no significant modification of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 correlation shape . in other words ,",
    "the correlation shapes are to first order sensitive only to the kinematics of the decay given the meson masses ( a much tighter constraint ) .",
    "the details of the analysis ( background subtraction , fitting procedure and @xmath35 ratio extraction ) are in ref .",
    "figure  [ fig : bcontribution ] shows the resulting @xmath35 ratio from this analysis ( filled squares ) .",
    "the error bars are statistical , and the shaded band is the systematic uncertainty ( mainly from photonic - background reconstruction efficiency ) .",
    "the two lines in the figure are from fonll calculations , showing the bounds of the theoretical uncertainties ( mass and renormalization scale ) .",
    "the data from this measurement are consistent with the fonll calculations .",
    "this has important implications for the  data .",
    "since model calculations attempting to describe the non - photonic electron suppression in  were not able to reproduce the large amount of suppression , a better agreement could be arrived at assuming the @xmath33 contribution only starts to appear at @xmath36 . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcontribution ] disallows such solution , and one is left with the conclusion that to explain the data it is necessary to suppress the @xmath33 mesons in central  at rhic . a possible mechanism for @xmath33 suppression discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite invokes collisional dissociation of the @xmath33 mesons .      during 2006 ,",
    "several analyses benefited from the completion of the star emc ( @xmath11 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "one is a measurement of the  production at mid - rapidity .",
    "the larger coverage of the calorimeter improves the  acceptance in star by a factor of 4 over the coverage during the 2004 run . during the 2006  run , we sampled an integrated luminosity of @xmath38 .",
    "two main trigger settings were used during the running period ; we analyzed and obtained full corrections for one of these .",
    "figure  [ fig : upsilon](left ) shows the measurement of the ( 1s+2s+3s ) cross section @xmath39 .",
    "the filled histogram shows the background - subtracted counts in the  mass region to illustrate the acceptance .",
    "the left abscissa shows the @xmath40 scale and the right abscissa shows the scale for the raw - count histogram .",
    "the error bars in the cross section measurement are the statistical error and the shaded rectangle is the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the low cross section of the  at rhic makes this a luminosity limited measurement .",
    "we compare the datum point to a nlo calculation of the @xmath41(1s ) cross section scaled by 1.44 ( based on cdf @xcite ) to account for the excited states .",
    "figure  [ fig : upsilon](right ) shows the the world data on production as a function of @xmath42 , compared to nlo calculations .",
    "the nlo calculation is consistent with our measurement within our uncertainties .",
    "future measurements of  production in will yield additional clues as to the temperature of the produced matter .",
    "finally , we present results from the analysis of photon - hadron ( @xmath3 ) correlations in  collisions .",
    "this analysis has also benefited from the increased coverage of the calorimeter . compared to two - particle correlations using di - hadrons , @xmath3 measurements in",
    "hold the promise to essentially remove the surface bias that complicates the interpretation and model comparison of the correlations . since the photon will not suffer the effects of energy loss it can be used as a reference for the momentum transfer of the partonic hard process .    in the analysis of @xmath3 correlations ,",
    "the dominant source of background to the measurement of direct photons is @xmath43 contamination .",
    "the emc shower maximum detector ( smd ) is employed as a discriminator between direct @xmath4 s and @xmath43 s ( for details , see ref .",
    "the smd showers can be used to select showers with @xmath43-like shape , @xmath4-like shape , or somewhere in between .",
    "the tell - tale signature of a direct @xmath4 is that it should have no associated hadrons near it in @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma - hvset](left ) shows the near - side yields of the @xmath43-enriched ( open circles ) , mixed ( open stars ) , and @xmath4-enriched ( filled circles ) samples _ vs. _  @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath4-enriched data show a decrease of the yield at high , consistent with the expected behavior for @xmath4-jet events . for this sample ,",
    "the away - side yield is compared to @xmath4-jet simulations using hijing in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - hvset](right ) .",
    "the observed  spectrum of the away side yields is consistent with the calculations within our experimental uncertainty , an encouraging development for future tomographic explorations of the medium using high-  photons .",
    "we have measured di - hadron correlations in a large fraction of the available kinematics at rhic energies .",
    "we presented in this conference results on @xmath14 correlations at intermediate- to high- . using a simple ansatz to isolate the yield in the jet - like near - side region and subtracting it from the total to quantify the yield in the `` ridge '' region , we observe that the near - side jet - like peak shows compatibility with vacuum fragmentation behavior .",
    "our hope is that with the quantitative measurements of the correlations from low , intermediate and high-  will be less `` fragile '' than single inclusive spectra , and this robustness can provide tighter constraints on the estimations of the density .",
    "the analysis of @xmath32 correlations has yielded the first estimate of the @xmath33 contribution to the non - photonic electrons in ; we find it consistent with fonll calculations .",
    "together with the measured suppression of the non - photonic electron inclusive spectrum , the corollary of this observation is that there must be @xmath33 suppression at rhic in .",
    "we presented first  results from two luminosity - hungry measurements : the  cross section and the @xmath3 correlation . a larger integrated luminosity in future runs and rhic",
    "ii should allow a measurement of the  ( 2s)/(1s ) and ( 3s)/(1s ) ratios : perhaps one of the most direct ways to connect experimental data to a temperature calculated from lattice",
    "the @xmath3 measurement allows experimentalists to vary the surface bias that exists in measurements relying on particles which suffer energy loss , so it can be one of the ultimate probes of the medium density .",
    "having performed the proof - of - principle measurements , we now eagerly await a chance to take the data to complete these programs .",
