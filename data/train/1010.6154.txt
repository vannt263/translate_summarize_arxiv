    "it is well known that entanglement of quantum states is a genuine physical resource for various quantum information tasks such as quantum teleportation@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite , and quantum computer technology@xcite . in this reason , recently , much attention is paid to the various properties of the entanglement@xcite .",
    "in addition to the pure quantum mechanical aspect it is also important to analyze the entanglement of multipartite quantum state in the relativistic framework . evidently , this is an interesting subject from a fundamental point of view .",
    "furthermore , it is also important from a practical perspective because many modern experiments on quantum information processing use photons or other particles , which have relativistic velocities .",
    "the bipartite entanglement between inertial frames was investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the remarkable fact in the entanglement between inertial frames is its conservation although the entanglement between some degrees of freedom can be transferred to others .",
    "still , however , it is not obvious why the entanglement between inertial frames is preserved .",
    "the bipartite entanglement between noninertial frames was initially studied by fuentes - schuller and mann ( fm ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "they showed that the maximal bipartite entanglement between inertial parties is degraded if the observers are relatively accelerated",
    ". with increasing acceleration degradation of entanglement becomes larger and larger , and eventually the bipartite state reduces to the separable state at infinite acceleration .",
    "this phenomenon is sometimes called ` unruh decoherence ' and is closely related to the unruh effect@xcite . due to resemblance between unruh effect and hawking radiation@xcite",
    "fm predicted that the degradation of entanglement occurs in the black hole physics .",
    "the degradation phenomenon of bipartite entanglement in a schwarzschild black hole was investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the entanglement is degraded near a schwarzschild black hole as fm predicted , there is a subtle difference arising due to a difference of an event horizon in schwarzschild spacetime from an acceleration horizon in rindler spacetime .",
    "recently , quantum teleportation between noninertial observers is also discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we discuss on the tripartite entanglement in noninertial frame .",
    "as far as we know there are two entanglement measures which quantify the genuine tripartite entanglement : three - tangle@xcite and @xmath0-tangle@xcite .",
    "the three - tangle has many nice properties and is exactly coincides with the modulus of a cayley s hyperdeterminant@xcite .",
    "it is also an invariant quantity under the local @xmath3 transformation@xcite .",
    "even though its nice features it has a drawback due to its calculational difficulty . since we need an optimal decomposition for analytical computation of the three - tangle for a given tripartite mixed state , it is highly difficult problem to compute the three - tangle analytically except few rare cases@xcite .",
    "in order to escape this difficulty we adopt the @xmath0-tangle for the quantification of the tripartite entanglement solely due to its calculational easiness .",
    "the physical roles of the three - tangle and @xmath0-tangle in the real quantum information processing was , recently , discussed in ref.@xcite in detail .    in this paper",
    "we are considering the following situation .",
    "let alice , bob and charlie share the greenberger - horne - zeilinger(ghz)@xcite or w - state@xcite initially when they are not moving relatively .",
    "after then , charlie moves with a uniform acceleration with respect to alice and bob .",
    "we compute the @xmath0-tangle as a function of charlie s acceleration .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the @xmath0-tangle , in general , decreases with increasing the acceleration like the bipartite entanglement .",
    "however , we show that unlike the bipartite entanglement the @xmath0-tangle does not completely vanish even if charlie moves with an infinite acceleration .",
    "this is a striking result in a sense that this fact implies the possibility of the tripartite quantum information processing although charlie approaches to the rindler horizon .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider a situation where alice , bob , and charlie share the ghz state initially .",
    "it is shown that the resulting @xmath0-tangle decreases with increasing charlie s acceleration from @xmath4 at zero acceleration to @xmath1 at infinite acceleration . in section",
    "iii the ghz state in the previous section is replaced with w - state .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath0-tangle in this case also decreases with increasing acceleration from @xmath5 at zero acceleration to @xmath2 at infinite acceleration . in section",
    "vi we discuss the physical implications of the results in the context of the black hole physics .",
    "in this section we assume that alice , bob , and charlie share initially ghz state defined as @xmath6.\\ ] ] after sharing his own qubit charlie moves with respect to alice and bob with a uniform acceleration @xmath7 .",
    "then , charlie s vacuum and @xmath4-particle states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where the subscript ` m ' stands for minkowski , are transformed into@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parameter proportional to charlie s acceleration , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mode decomposition in the two causally disconnected regions in rindler space .",
    "eq.([unruh1 ] ) implies that the physical information formed initially in region i is leaked to the inaccessible region ( region ii ) due to accelerating motion .",
    "this loss of information causes a particle detector in the region i to detect a thermally average state , which is a main scenario of unruh effect@xcite .",
    "therefore , charlie s acceleration transforms the ghz state into @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath16 is a physically inaccessible state from alice , bob , and charlie , we should average it out via a partial trace .",
    "thus , the quantum state shared by alice , bob , and charlie reduces to the following mixed state : @xmath17.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is very similar to the information loss of hawking radiation in the black hole physics , where the pure ` in ' state becomes thermally mixed ` out ' state due to the gravitation collapse@xcite .    to quantify how much @xmath18",
    "is entangled we introduce a @xmath0-tangle@xcite defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 in eq.([pi2 ] ) @xmath21 and @xmath22 are one - tangle and two - tangle respectively , defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the partial transposition for @xmath26-qubit and @xmath27 is a trace norm of operator @xmath28 defined as @xmath29 .",
    "although one - tangle can be easily computed in the qubit system by using @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , we can not use this convenient formula because charlie s accelerating motion makes the quantum state infinite - dimensional qudit state .",
    "thus , we have to use the original definition for computation of one - tangle .",
    "now , let us compute one - tangles . in order to compute @xmath32 first",

    "however , one can compute the eigenvalues of @xmath46 analytically by ordering the basis of hilbert space as @xmath48 then , the non - vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath46 are @xmath49 where @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the one - tangle @xmath44 can be computed straightforwardly from its definition , whose explicit expression is @xmath51 it seems to be impossible to express @xmath44 in terms of the polylogarithmic function as the previous cases .",
    "-dependence of the one - tangles when alice , bob , and charlie share the ghz state initially .",

    "this figure shows that while @xmath44 reduces to zero at @xmath52 limit , other one - tangles do not completely vanish , but goes to @xmath53 in this limit.,height=377 ]    we plot the @xmath11-dependence of one - tangles in fig .",
    "all one - tangles become one at @xmath54 , which is exactly the value of one - tangles at the rest frame .",
    "as expected from the degradation of the bipartite entanglement in noninertial frame all one - tangles decrease with increasing charlie s acceleration . at @xmath52 @xmath44",
    "goes to zero .",
    "this can be understood from a fact that alice and bob can not contribute to charlie s entanglement because of charlie s infinite acceleration with respect to alice and bob . from this fact",
    "we guess that the one - tangle @xmath44 goes to zero when charlie falls into a black hole while alice and bob are near event horizon of the black hole .",
    "this fact also predicts that the coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw ) inequality@xcite , @xmath55 , is saturated at @xmath52 .",
    "as will be shown shortly , this is indeed the case .",
    "surprising fact is that the one - tangles @xmath32 and @xmath56 do not vanish but go to @xmath53 in @xmath52 limit .",
    "mathematically , this limiting value is originated from particular properties of the polylogarithmic function .",

    "the @xmath0-tangle decreases with increasing charlie s acceleration .",
    "unlike bipartite entanglement , however , the @xmath0-tangle does not completely vanish in @xmath52 limit , but approaches to @xmath1 in this limit .",
    "this fact enables us to predict that the tripartite entanglement does not completely vanish when charlie falls into black hole .",
    "if so , this is very surprising result because this fact implies that quantum communication process might be possible between parties even in the presence of the event horizon .",
    "this prediction should be checked in the near future by incorporating the quantum information theories in the black hole physics .",
    "in this section we assume that initially alice , bob , and charlie share w - state @xmath66 by making use of eq.([unruh1 ] ) one can show that after charlie s accelerating motion @xmath67 reduces to @xmath68 \\otimes { \\lvert n \\rangle}_{ii}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 .",

    "this implies that the effect of charlie s acceleration is contributed to these two two - tangles .",

    "thus , the @xmath0-tangle does not completely vanish even if one of the parties approaches to the rindler horizon .",
    "the non - vanishment of the @xmath0-tangle at the infinite acceleration is a striking result .",
    "since rindler spacetime is similar to the schwarzschild spacetime , this result enables us to conjecture that the tripartite entanglement does not completely vanish even if one party falls into the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "if so , some quantum information processing such as tripartite teleportation@xcite can be performed between inside and outside the black hole . since",
    ", however , rindler horizon is different from the event horizon physically , we should check this conjecture explicitly by actual calculation .",
    "we would like to re - visit this issue in the near future .    probably , the non - vanishment of the @xmath0-tangle at the infinite acceleration is due to the incomplete definition of the @xmath0-tangle as a measure of the tripartite entanglement .",
    "thus , it seems to be interesting to repeat the calculation of this paper by making use of the three - tangle .",
    "since , however , the computation of the three - tangle requires the optimal decomposition of the given mixed state , its calculation is much more difficult compared to the @xmath0-tangle . in order to explore this issue ,",
    "therefore , we should develop analytical and numerical techniques for the computation of the three - tangle .",
    "since recent string and brane - world theories predict the extra dimensions in the spacetime , it seems to be also of interest to study on the effect of the extra dimensions in the degradation phenomena of bipartite and tripartite entanglements .",
    "another interesting issue is to explore the effect of the black hole s rotation in the bipartite and tripartite entanglements .",
    "there are many interesting questions related to this issue .",
    "for example , it seems to be interesting to examine the relation between superradiance and degradation of entanglement .",
