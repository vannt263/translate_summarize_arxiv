    "semi - inclusive processes in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) are of importance because they can be used to test the perturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) description of hadron production via parton fragmentation .",
    "an observable of particular interest is the distribution of the azimuthal angle , @xmath57 ( measured in the hadronic centre - of - mass frame , hcm ) between the lepton scattering plane , defined by the incoming and outgoing lepton momenta , and the hadron production plane , defined by the exchanged virtual boson and an outgoing hadron ( fig .  [ fig : laurel ] ) .",
    "asymmetries in the @xmath58 distribution , i.e. terms proportional to @xmath59 and @xmath60 arise whenever a non - zero transverse momentum , in the hcm frame , is present in the scattering process .",
    "consequently both non - perturbative and perturbative qcd effects  @xcite give rise to these asymmetries .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of parton production has the form    @xmath61    this form results from the polarisation of the exchanged virtual boson .",
    "the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on the helicities of the final - state parton(s ) , partonic transverse momenta and on colour coherence  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 term is expected from interference of amplitudes arising from the @xmath64 and @xmath65 helicity components of the transversely - polarised part of the exchanged boson , whereas transverse / longitudinal interference gives rise to the @xmath66 term .",
    "the asymmetry that results from the intrinsic momentum of a quark in the proton is referred to as the non - perturbative asymmetry .",
    "since the intrinsic momentum is small , this asymmetry should fall rapidly with increasing transverse momentum of the measured hadron and with increasing @xmath67  @xcite , where @xmath68 is the negative square of the four - momentum of the virtual exchanged boson .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath63 is small at high @xmath67 for the non - perturbative effect .",
    "in contrast , the asymmetry associated with leading - order terms in perturbative qcd calculations , the perturbative asymmetry , is weakly dependent on @xmath67 and persists at high transverse momenta .",
    "the perturbative qcd contribution to terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 is large at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath69 at this order , two processes contribute to dis : qcd - compton scattering ( qcdc , @xmath70 ) and boson - gluon fusion ( bgf , @xmath71 ) . for the qcdc process",
    "the scattered quark preferentially appears at @xmath58 near @xmath72 whilst for the bgf process the @xmath58 dependence has a symmetry about @xmath73 as a consequence of the quark / anti - quark final state .",
    "the bgf process is the dominant contribution to the @xmath74 term , while the qcdc contribution dominates the @xmath75 term .",
    "the @xmath74 term can be unambiguously attributed to perturbative qcd processes in the high @xmath67 region under investigation .",
    "terms in @xmath76 and @xmath77 are also theoretically expected only for deep inelastic scattering with polarised leptons or charged current reactions . even in these cases ,",
    "their magnitude is however estimated to be substantially smaller than terms in @xmath66 and @xmath60  @xcite .    the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : azi ] is expected to be maintained for single particle production  @xcite , since high - momentum hadrons are produced close to the direction of the parton .",
    "measurable perturbative and non - perturbative predictions for the asymmetries in hadron production require the use of an appropriate fragmentation function or hadronisation mechanism .",
    "note that in order to observe the @xmath59 asymmetry , a selection procedure is required which consistently associates leading hadrons produced from either quarks or gluons  @xcite .",
    "this is described in section  [ sec : expt ] .",
    "the transverse momenta arising from the fragmentation itself does not contribute to the asymmetry but only smears the observed distribution  @xcite .",
    "the event kinematics of dis are determined by @xmath67 , and one of the two bjorken scaling variables @xmath78 or @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the four - momentum of the incoming proton and @xmath81 is the positron - proton centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the kinematic region studied is @xmath82 and @xmath83 corresponding to a @xmath67 range @xmath84    charged particles are selected over a defined range of @xmath85 values , where @xmath85 is the transverse momentum with respect to the @xmath86 axis in the hcm system .",
    "results for the asymmetry are presented as a function of @xmath87 the minimum value of @xmath85 of the selected charged particles , since the qcd predictions depend on this variable .",
    "the measurements are compared to theoretical expectations .",
    "previous studies of single hadron production in neutral current dis have observed a @xmath75 term that was attributed to non - perturbative effects  @xcite . here , for the first time , the observation of both @xmath88 and @xmath89 terms are reported . as discussed above",
    ", the @xmath89 term can be unambiguously attributed to perturbative qcd processes .",
    "the data presented here were taken at the positron - proton collider hera using the zeus detector .",
    "the @xmath90 of data were taken in 1996 and 1997 , when hera operated with positrons of energy @xmath91  gev and protons with energy @xmath92  gev .",
    "a detailed description of the zeus detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "the standard zeus right - handed coordinate system is used , in which @xmath93 is the nominal interaction point , the positive @xmath94-axis points in the direction of the proton beam ( referred to as the forward direction ) and the @xmath95-axis is horizontal , pointing towards the centre of hera .",
    "the polar angle , @xmath96 is defined with respect to the positive @xmath94 direction .",
    "the key component for this analysis is the central tracking detector ( ctd )  @xcite which operates in a magnetic field of 1.43 t provided by a thin superconducting solenoid .",
    "the ctd is a drift chamber consisting of 72 cylindrical layers , covering the region @xmath97 .",
    "the transverse momentum resolution for full - length tracks is @xmath98 @xmath99 ( @xmath100 in gev ) .",
    "the interaction vertex is measured using the ctd with a typical resolution along ( transverse to ) the beam direction of 0.4 ( 0.1 ) cm .    also important for this analysis",
    "is the uranium - scintillator sampling calorimeter ( cal )  @xcite , which surrounds the solenoid .",
    "the cal consists of 5918 cells , organised in three sections , the forward ( fcal ) , barrel ( bcal ) and rear ( rcal ) , with longitudinal segmentation into electromagnetic and hadronic sections .",
    "the energy resolutions , as measured in test beams , are @xmath101 = 0.18/@xmath102 and 0.35/@xmath102 for electrons and hadrons , respectively .",
    "the angular coverage of the zeus detector allows the kinematic variables @xmath103 and @xmath104 to be reconstructed in a variety of ways using combinations of energies and angles of the positron and the hadronic system .",
    "variables calculated only from the measurements of the energy , @xmath105 and angle , @xmath106 of the scattered positron are denoted with the subscript @xmath107 , whilst those calculated from the hadronic system measurements , using the jacquet - blondel method  @xcite , are denoted by the subscript @xmath108 variables calculated by these approaches are used only in the event selection . in the double angle method  @xcite ,",
    "denoted by @xmath109 the kinematic variables are determined using @xmath110 and the angle @xmath111 ( which is the direction of the struck quark in the qpm ) , evaluated using the cal cells corresponding to the hadronic final state .",
    "the @xmath112 method was used throughout this analysis for the calculation of the boosts and the kinematic variables because it is less sensitive than other methods to systematic uncertainties in the cal energy measurement .",
    "corrections are applied  @xcite for hadronic energy loss in inactive material in front of the calorimeter and for the backscattering of particles into the bcal or rcal from hadron jets in the fcal direction .",
    "the triggering and online event selections were identical to those used for the zeus measurement of the structure function @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "further selection criteria were applied both to ensure accurate reconstruction of the kinematic variables and to increase the purity of the sample by eliminating background from photoproduction processes :    * @xmath114 , to achieve a high purity sample of dis events ; * @xmath115 , to reduce the photoproduction background ; * @xmath116 , to give sufficient accuracy for @xmath112 reconstruction of @xmath67 and @xmath103 ; * @xmath117  gev , where the summation is over all calorimeter cells , to remove photoproduction events and events with large radiative corrections ; * @xmath118 where @xmath95 and @xmath119 are the impact position of the positron on the rcal , to avoid the region adjacent to the rear beampipe ; * @xmath120 to reduce background events from processes other than @xmath121 collisions ; * @xmath122 and @xmath123 to ensure @xmath124 lies within the ctd acceptance .",
    "the reconstructed tracks used in the charged particle analysis are associated with the primary event vertex and are required to have @xmath125  mev and @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the pseudorapidity , given by @xmath128 these cuts select the region of ctd acceptance where the detector response and systematics are best understood .",
    "since the gluon fragmentation function is ` softer ' than that of the quarks , the hadron - quark correlation can be enhanced by selecting ` leading ' charged particles .",
    "this was accomplished by cutting on the lorentz - invariant variable @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the track or particle four - vector .",
    "the tracks were selected if @xmath131 no selection biases arise from the @xmath132 cut applied in the laboratory frame .",
    "the number of events that pass the event selection is just over 13,800 ; approximately 7,700 charged tracks satisfy the @xmath133 criteria . in principle , more than one entry per event is permitted . however , as can be seen from the above numbers , such an occurrence is rare .",
    "monte carlo event simulation is used to correct for acceptance and resolution effects .",
    "the detector simulation is based on the geant  3.13 program  @xcite .    to calculate correction factors ,",
    "neutral current dis events were generated via django6  2.4 @xcite , using heracles  4.5.2  @xcite , which incorporates first - order electroweak corrections .",
    "the parton cascade was modelled with the colour dipole model ( cdm ) , using the ariadne  4.10 @xcite program , in which colour coherence effects are implicitly included in the formalism of the parton cascade .",
    "the lund string fragmentation model  @xcite is used for the hadronisation , as implemented in jetset  7.4 @xcite . for the analysis of the data ,",
    "a monte carlo sample of 120k events , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath134 was generated with @xmath135 and @xmath136 and the cteq4d  @xcite parameterisation of the proton s parton distribution functions .",
    "the @xmath137 parameterisation has been shown to describe satisfactorily the hera measurements of the proton structure function @xmath113 @xcite in the kinematic regions investigated .    for systematic checks , an additional sample of 120k events",
    "was generated using the django6 and lepto  6.5  @xcite monte carlo programs .",
    "the parton shower option , matched to the @xmath138 matrix elements ( me+ps ) , was used to simulate the parton cascade .",
    "the coherence effects in the final - state cascade are included by angular ordering of successive parton emissions .",
    "for the hadronisation the lund string model was used and for the parameterisation of the parton distribution functions cteq4d was used .",
    "the lepto sample was generated with the soft colour interactions  @xcite turned off .",
    "the ariadne sample was generated with the high @xmath67 modification developed during the 1998 hera monte carlo workshop  @xcite . a version of ariadne  4.10 , with a corrected implementation of the @xmath58 dependence ,",
    "was made available by the author  @xcite and it is this version that is used in the comparison with the data .",
    "the pomeron - scattering option of ariadne was switched off .",
    "the monte carlo samples described above were used to correct the differential @xmath58 distributions for detector effects . to minimise the sensitivity of the correction procedure to the underlying theoretical input of the monte carlo generator , the data were fitted using the following approach . rather than correcting the data directly ,",
    "a theoretical distribution @xmath139 was used to represent the corrected azimuthal angle , @xmath140 distribution .",
    "the parametrisation @xmath139 used in the analysis is that given in equation  ( [ eq : azi ] ) plus an additional @xmath141 term , so that @xmath142 here denotes the set of parameters @xmath143 the set of parameters , @xmath144 was determined by minimising the quantity    @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the measured @xmath58 distribution and @xmath147 is the theoretical distribution smeared for detector effects .",
    "the term @xmath148 is the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties of @xmath149 and @xmath150 the detector smearing takes account of : ( i ) migration between different @xmath151 bins , ( ii ) track reconstruction efficiency and the @xmath152 - @xmath153 migration matrix and ( iii ) correction factors for pair conversion , @xmath154 decay etc .",
    "these smearing coefficients were obtained from generated and reconstructed monte carlo events .    for a bin size of @xmath155 radians ,",
    "the efficiency for a generated @xmath58 to be reconstructed in the same bin as generated is @xmath156 the purity of the reconstructed @xmath58 bin ( i.e. the percentage of the tracks reconstructed in a bin coming from particles generated in the same bin ) is @xmath157    it should be noted that in this procedure a corrected experimental @xmath58 distribution is not determined . instead the parameterisation of the true @xmath139 distribution is fitted directly to the data .",
    "an important feature of this method is the fact that the @xmath152 - @xmath153 migration matrix depends only weakly on the generated @xmath58 distribution , and is essentially determined by the experimental inefficiencies , which are well simulated . because significant off - diagonal elements are present in the matrix , this fitting technique was used for the main analysis .",
    "the more conventional bin - by - bin correction method was used as a check .",
    "though this method is expected to be more dependent on the underlying physics in the generated distribution it has the advantage of producing a corrected experimental @xmath58 distribution .",
    "correction factors , @xmath158 were obtained from the monte carlo simulation by comparing the generated distributions before the detector and trigger simulation with the `` observed '' distributions after these simulations followed by the same reconstruction , selection and analysis as the real data . the correction factor for @xmath58",
    "is defined as the ratio of the generated and observed differential @xmath58 distributions : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the number of monte carlo events and @xmath161 the number of charged particles in the @xmath151 range .",
    "the correction factors are in the range 0.8 - 1.2 .",
    "the major systematic errors can be divided into three types : uncertainties due to event reconstruction and selection ; to track selection ; and to the modelling of the hadronic system .",
    "no single systematic uncertainty was larger than the statistical error in the mean of either @xmath75 or @xmath162 for both mean values , the largest effects , which approached the statistical uncertainties , were associated with : the inclusion of tracks not associated with the primary vertex ; the use of different correction procedures for the energy scattered into the calorimeter from the interaction of energetic particles in the forward direction ; the use of an alternative approach to correct for energy losses due to inactive material between the calorimeter and the interaction vertex ; and the @xmath133 cut being lowered by an amount commensurate with its reconstruction resolution .",
    "the mean value of @xmath74 was also reduced by its statistical uncertainty for @xmath163 when lepto was used to correct the data .",
    "the upper and lower uncertainties extracted from these systematic checks were added separately in quadrature .",
    "three additional cross - checks were made on the measurement that were not included in the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the analysis was repeated using : ( i ) the bin - by - bin correction ; ( ii ) the measured positron energy in place of that calculated from the da method , to check the sensitivity to the boost , and ( iii ) only events without bremsstrahlung from the monte carlo sample . in each case",
    "the results were consistent , within statistical errors , with those from the original analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : phidist ] shows the differential @xmath58 distributions of charged hadrons for four values of the @xmath85 cut , @xmath87 in the hadronic centre - of - mass .",
    "the results obtained from the main analysis method ( full line ) and the bin - by - bin correction method ( points ) are seen to agree . at low @xmath87 a clear @xmath75 term is observed . as the value of @xmath164",
    "is increased a @xmath74 term becomes evident .",
    "figure  [ fig : phievol ] shows the moments @xmath165 and @xmath166 as a function of @xmath167 they were calculated from the fit using @xmath168 the @xmath76 term is consistent with zero independent of the value chosen for @xmath167 the statistical errors are those obtained from fitting the data .",
    "the value of @xmath165 is negative and decreases in magnitude as @xmath164 is increased .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath166 is positive and rises as @xmath164 is increased .",
    "figure  [ fig : phievol ] also shows predictions of the lund monte carlo programs ( lepto and ariadne ) .",
    "the data have larger absolute values of @xmath165 than predicted by lepto , though for higher values of @xmath164 the agreement is reasonable .",
    "the dependence of @xmath169 on @xmath164 is weaker in the lepto generator than in the data . imposing a flat @xmath58 dependence on the matrix elements implemented in the lepto program , in order to investigate any asymmetry arising from purely qcd coherence effects , results in behaviour different from the data",
    "; both moments are almost zero for all values of @xmath167 the ariadne monte carlo predictions tend to have smaller absolute values of @xmath165 than the data , whilst the @xmath166 term is in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc_lo ] compares the data with two lo qcd calculations .",
    "both calculations were made with @xmath170 as the appropriate scale , with the binnewies et al .",
    "lo fragmentation function  @xcite and with the cteq4 lo proton parton densities  @xcite .",
    "the lo calculations result in a qualitatively similar behaviour to the lepto and ariadne monte carlo generator predictions .",
    "the analytic calculation from zeus ( based on the calculation of chay et al .",
    "@xcite ) includes an estimation of the non - perturbative contribution , from intrinsic @xmath171 and hadronisation @xmath172 and integrates over the whole kinematic range .",
    "the results of ahmed  & gehrmann are purely perturbative at leading order in @xmath173 and are evaluated at the mean values @xmath174 and @xmath175 of the data",
    ". the different implementations account for the observed difference in the two predictions ; using @xmath176 and @xmath177 in the zeus perturbative calculation leads to agreement with the ahmed  & gehrmann calculation .",
    "there are perturbative and non - perturbative contributions to both @xmath178 and @xmath179 for @xmath180 the non - perturbative contribution to the zeus calculation is at most 20% at low @xmath164 for a mean intrinsic @xmath171 of @xmath181 and a non - perturbative fragmentation @xmath85 of @xmath182 however , this fraction depends on the values of @xmath171 and @xmath85 used . for @xmath183",
    "this non - perturbative contribution is negligible , even for mean values of @xmath184 and @xmath185 it can be concluded that the observation of a significant @xmath166 term is clear evidence for a perturbative contribution to the azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "the sensitivity to higher - order corrections was examined at the partonic level using the disent monte carlo program  @xcite .",
    "this study suggests that higher - order corrections are large ( factors of 2 - 3 ) at low @xmath164 for the @xmath186 term , resulting in larger negative values . for the @xmath166 term",
    "they are much smaller .",
    "this may explain the disagreement between the data and the lo qcd models for @xmath187 at low @xmath167",
    "the azimuthal asymmetries in the deep inelastic electroproduction of single particles have been measured at hera in the hadronic centre - of - mass frame in the kinematic region , @xmath188 and @xmath189 for hadrons produced at large transverse momenta , the measured value for @xmath190 is negative and is in agreement with qcd predictions .",
    "the moment @xmath166 has been measured here for the first time and is non - zero and positive .",
    "it increases as a function of the minimum particle transverse momentum , as expected from qcd . since the non - perturbative contribution to @xmath191",
    "is predicted to be negligible , this measurement provides clear evidence for a perturbative qcd contribution to the azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "the strong support and encouragement of the desy directorate have been invaluable , and we are much indebted to the hera machine group for their inventiveness and diligent efforts . the design , construction and installation of the zeus detector have been made possible by the ingenuity and dedicated efforts of many people from inside desy and from the home institutes who are not listed as authors .",
