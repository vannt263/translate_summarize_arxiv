    "the shadows of two - dimensional objects are line segments , so it is easy to construct examples of two objects such that one hides behind the other but has a larger area than the other . however , in three dimensions , since shadows have shapes , the question is more complicated . in @xcite , it was shown that in three dimensions , there exist two convex bodies such that one can hide behind the other but have a larger volume than the other .",
    "examples that invoke minkowski sums were presented in @xcite , but optimal ratios were not calculated .",
    "recently , in @xcite , it was shown that in @xmath2 dimensions , the optimal volume ratio for two such objects is bounded above by @xmath3 , which decreases monotonically and approaches @xmath4 as @xmath2 approaches infinity .",
    "in particular , a universal bound of 2.942 was obtained , which is the value of the expression for @xmath5 and which can be easily verified for @xmath6 .    here",
    ", we present two examples and calculate the optimal numerical ratios for each . in particular , our examples require the minkowski sums of a tetrahedron and a ball and a tetrahedron and an inverted tetrahedron .",
    "the optimal volume ratio calculated for the first example is 1.12 , and the optimal volume ratio calculated for the second example is 1.16 .    in section  [ sec : def ] , we define all the relevant terms and present two two - dimensional examples of pairs of objects such that one can hide behind another but have a bigger area than the other . in section  [ sec : tetraball ] and section  [ sec : tetratetra ] , we present our new examples . in section  [ sec : futureresearch ] , we conclude with ideas for continued research .",
    "define a _ shadow _ of an @xmath2-dimensional body @xmath7 as an orthogonal projection of @xmath7 onto @xmath8 .",
    "a body @xmath0 is defined to be able to _ hide behind _ a body @xmath1 if the orthogonal projection of @xmath1 contains a translation of the corresponding orthogonal projection of @xmath0 in every direction .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : hidebehind ] , a disk of radius @xmath9 can hide behind a unit equilateral triangle .",
    "the shadows of the disk are line segments of length @xmath10 , and the shadows of the triangle are line segments ranging in length from @xmath10 to 1 .",
    "the _ minkowski sum _ of two sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a vector space is the set obtained by adding every element in @xmath0 to every element in @xmath1 , expressed as @xmath11    for example , figure  [ fig : minkexample ] illustrates the minkowsi sum of a square and an equilateral triangle , both scaled by @xmath12 .",
    "we can also define the _ minkowski interpolation _ of two objects @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the minkowski sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are scaling constants .    [",

    "the minkowski interpolation of a triangle and a disk can hide behind the original triangle but not hide inside it .",
    "see figure  [ fig : triangledisk ] .",
    "although the original disk , with radius @xmath9 , which has a larger area than the unit triangle , can hide behind the triangle , invoking minkowski sums generates a shape with a greater area ratio .",
    "more precisely , the area ratio is maximized by the minkowski sum of the disk scaled by @xmath38 , generating the approximate area ratio @xmath39 .    as another example , the minkowski interpolation of a triangle and an inverted triangle can hide behind the original disk but not hide inside it .",
    "see figure  [ fig : triangletriangle ] .",
    "the area ratio is maximized by the minkowski sum of both shapes scaled by @xmath12 , generating the area ratio @xmath40 , which is the optimal area ratio in two dimensions , by steiner s theorem .",
    "note that the case involving two triangles generates a higher area ratio than the case involving a triangle and a disk .",
    "this result extends to three dimensions , as will be shown in the next two sections , which describe two three - dimensional examples involving a tetrahedron .",
    "one example in which one body can hide behind another body of smaller volume is generated by the minkowski interpolation of a tetrahedron and a ball .",
    "suppose a unit tetrahedron is positioned in the coordinate plane with vertices at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "by lemma  [ lem : scaling ] , to calculate the highest volume ratio in this example , it is necessary to first calculate the radius of the largest circle that can always be contained in the shadow of the tetrahedron , in other words , the smallest inradius of all possible orthogonal projections of the tetrahedron .",
    "[ lem : inradius ] the smallest inradius of all possible shadows of the tetrahedron is @xmath45 .",
    "all possible orthogonal projections onto the @xmath46-plane can be obtained by rotating the tetrahedron first clockwise about the @xmath47-axis by @xmath15 degrees and then counterclockwise about the @xmath48-axis by @xmath16 degrees , which is sufficient because only the shape and not the configuration of the projection is relevant , as all the orthogonal projections of a ball are disks .",
    "the new coordinates of the vertices of the tetrahedron after these transformations can be explicitly calculated by matrix multiplication involving the rotation matrices @xmath49 for example , for the vertex @xmath42 , we have @xmath50 therefore , after the rotations , the coordinates of the projections of the vertices of the unit tetrahedron onto the @xmath46-plane are @xmath51 + @xmath52 + @xmath53 + @xmath54 + the shadow obtained by any projection is defined by the convex hull of these coordinates .    employing this procedure",
    ", we wrote a program that verified that the radius of the largest disk that can be contained in all orthogonal projections of the tetrahedron is @xmath45 , which is obtained by projecting parallel to one of the faces of the tetrahedron .",
    "the maximum volume ratio for the minkowski interpolation of a tetrahedron and a ball is obtained by scaling the ball by @xmath55    @xmath56 where    @xmath57    and the corresponding volume ratio is approximately 1.124358246 .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the original tetrahedron and the ball with radius @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "then , the minkowski interpolation @xmath60 + where @xmath19 , can hide behind the tetrahedron .",
    "its volume can be expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 + @xmath63 + @xmath64 + expanding this expression yields a cubic function with respect to @xmath18 , which is maximized at    @xmath65    @xmath56 where    @xmath57    generating the maximum volume approximately 0.13250689 and the volume ratio approximately 1.124358246 .",
    "another example in which one body can hide behind another body of smaller volume is generated by the minkowski sum of a tetrahedron and an inverted tetrahedron .",
    "see figure  [ fig : uptetra ] , figure  [ fig : downtetra ] , and figure  [ fig : tetratetra ] for a tetrahedron , an inverted tetrahedron , and the minkowski sum obtained by scaling the tetrahedrons by some constants @xmath31 and @xmath66 .",

    "s containment theorem in @xcite and in @xcite , in two dimensions , any shape @xmath7 contains a translate of @xmath67 . since the shadows of @xmath58 and @xmath68 are two - dimensional , it follows that each projection of @xmath58 contains a translate of the corresponding projection of @xmath69 , so @xmath69 can hide behind @xmath58 .    to prove that this bound is sharp , note the projection perpendicular to the bases of the tetrahedra , which generates equilateral triangle shadows .",
    "it is clear that @xmath69 can hide behind @xmath58 but @xmath70 can not hide behind @xmath58 for any @xmath71 .",
    "the maximum volume ratio for the minkowski interpolation of a tetrahedron and an inverted tetrahedron is obtained by scaling the inverted tetrahedron by @xmath72 , and the corresponding volume ratio is approximately 1.1633587 .    for the appropriate parameters @xmath15 and @xmath73 , the volume of the minkowski interpolation of the tetrahedron and the inverted tetrahedron can be expressed , by means of mixed volumes , as @xmath74\\\\ & = \\alpha^3v(\\triangle)+3\\alpha^2\\beta v(\\triangle , \\triangle , -\\triangle)+3\\alpha\\beta^2v(\\triangle , -\\triangle , -\\triangle)+\\beta^3v(-\\triangle).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 circumscribes @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath77 , as a tetrahedron circumscribes the inverted tetrahedron formed by connecting the centroids of its faces .",

    "note that this is better than the ratio for the previous example .",
    "this case and the two - dimensional case , which is known , suggest the following conjecture .    in any dimension @xmath2 ,",
    "the best volume ratio is generated by the minkowski interpolation of a simplex and an inverted simplex .",
    "the question of whether our examples indeed generate the best volume ratio is still unsolved .",
    "the current ratio bounds are a lot bigger than our calculations , although patterns certainly suggest that we have calculated the highest ratio .",
