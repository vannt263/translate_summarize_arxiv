    "the interest in the form factor @xmath3 for transition processes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are photon momenta , has again increased recently . experimentally , the data on the form factor @xmath8 for small virtuality of one of the photons , @xmath9 , with the virtuality of the other photon being scanned up to @xmath10 gev@xmath11 , are known from cello @xcite and cleo @xcite collaborations .",
    "theoretically , at zero virtualities , the form factor @xmath12 is related to the axial anomaly . at",
    "asymptotically large photon virtualities , the behavior is predicted by perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite-@xcite ( see @xcite for recent discussions ) and depends crucially on the internal pion dynamics that is parametrized by the nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude ( da ) , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the fraction of the pion momentum , @xmath15 , carried by a quark .",
    "moreover , the knowledge of the off - shell structure of the form factor enables one to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the evaluation of the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution to the muon @xmath16",
    "@xcite , which is relevant for the current experiment e821 at bnl @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "it is convenient to parametrize photon virtualities as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the total virtuality of the photons and the asymmetry in their distribution : @xmath21 the experimental data from cleo @xcite for the process @xmath22 @xmath23 can be fitted by a monopole form factor : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the two - photon pion decay constant . in the lowest order of pqcd , by using the light - cone operator product expansion ( ope ) , the high @xmath26 behavior of the form factor is predicted  @xcite as @xmath27 with the asymptotic coefficient given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 mev is the weak pion decay constant and the leading - twist pion light - cone da is normalized by @xmath30 . since the pion da reflects the internal nonperturbative pion dynamics , the prediction of the value of @xmath31 is rather a nontrivial task , and its accurate measurement would provide quite valuable information .",
    "it is important to note that for the transition process considered , the leading asymptotic term of pqcd expansion ( [ amplasympt ] ) is not suppressed by the strong coupling constant @xmath32 . hence , the pqcd prediction ( [ amplasympt ] ) may become reasonable . ] at the highest of the presently accessible momenta @xmath33 gev@xmath34 . at asymptotically",
    "high @xmath26 , the da evolves to @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the fit of cleo data  ( [ fpiggfit ] ) corresponds to @xmath38 indicating that already at moderately high momenta this value is not too far from its asymptotic limit .",
    "however , since the pqcd evolution of the da reaches the asymptotic regime very slowly , its exact form at moderately high @xmath19 may not coincide with @xmath35 . at lower @xmath26 , the power corrections to the form factor",
    "become important .",
    "thus , to study the behavior of the transition form factor , at experimentally accessible @xmath26 , is the subject of nonperturbative dynamics , where the same type of the leading high @xmath26 behavior , as in eq .",
    "( [ amplasympt ] ) , was obtained by different methods .",
    "so , the theoretical determination of the transition form factor is still challenging , and it is desirable to obtain direct calculations of @xmath39 , without any _ a priori _ assumptions about the shape of the pion da .",
    "the transition form factor in the symmetric kinematics , @xmath40 , at high virtualities was considered in @xcite by using the local ope with the result @xmath41 for the asymptotic coefficient , which is in agreement with prediction from ( [ j ] ) at @xmath42 . within the local ope",
    ", one can represent @xmath43 as an expansion in powers of @xmath44 , with the coefficients of expansion given by the moments of the pion da : @xmath45 . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , it was shown that the local ope is well convergent in the kinematic region , when the photon virtualities are close to each other : @xmath46 . in this kinematics , the result for",
    "the asymptotic coefficient is still close to 4/3 .",
    "however , in these references it was pointed out that for @xmath47 potentially large corrections to the first term of the local ope @xcite and also to the light - cone pqcd @xcite predictions exist at any finite @xmath26 . with increasing @xmath48 , the number of terms of ope with higher - dimension vacuum expectation values growths rapidly , but it is practically a hopeless task to find more than few terms of the local expansion .",
    "therefore , much more detailed information about the nonperturbative qcd vacuum is necessary to have control over the operator expansion .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , some progress was achieved , by using a refined technique based on the ope with nonlocal condensates   @xcite , which is equivalent to inclusion of the whole series of power corrections . by using the qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates",
    ", it was shown that this approach works in almost the whole kinematic region @xmath49 , and that for high values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath50 , the pion transition form factor is very sensitive to the nonlocal structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the latter is characterized by the average quark virtuality in the vacuum @xcite , @xmath51 , and , within the instanton model @xcite , may be expressed through the average instanton size , @xmath52 , as @xmath53 @xcite . in @xcite , the form factor @xmath54",
    "was directly calculated from a qcd sum rule for the three - point function , leading to the estimate @xmath55 .",
    "the covariant nonlocal low - energy models ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , based on the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) approach to dynamics of quarks and gluons , have many attractive features , as the approach is consistent with the low - energy theorems . in particular ,",
    "the abelian axial anomaly is within this approach , and the standard result for @xmath56 is reproduced exactly . within this nonperturbative model of quark - pion interaction , both the small mass and composite structure of the pion are realistically described .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic nonlocal structure of the model may be motivated by fundamental qcd processes like the instanton and gluon exchanges . in @xcite",
    "the transition form factor @xmath57 was considered at low @xmath19 and agreement with data was obtained .",
    "there , it was observed that the results are very sensitive to the value of constituent quark mass .    in this letter , within the covariant nonlocal low - energy model of the quark - pion interaction we study the high @xmath19 behavior of the pion transition form factor @xmath58 in general kinematics .",
    "we show that the asymptotic coefficient @xmath59 , as demonstrated in qcd sum rules @xcite , depends on the kinematics of the transition process and on the internal pion dynamics induced by the nonlocal structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the dynamic dependence of @xmath60 is governed by the so - called diluteness parameter @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the constituent quark mass .",
    "when considering the model dependence of the asymptotic coefficient @xmath60 , experimental data can be very useful to distinguish between different assumptions made on nonperturbative dynamics of the qcd vacuum . within the nonlocal quark - pion model the expression for the asymptotic coefficient @xmath60",
    "is found in the whole kinematic region of @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , from this dependence , the pion da is reconstructed in terms of the quark - pion vertex function .",
    "the effective quark - pion dynamics can be summarized in the covariant nonlocal action given by @xmath64   \\bar{q}(x+y/2)\\ [ m_{q}+g_{\\pi \\bar{q}q}i\\gamma _ { 5}\\tau ^{a}\\pi ^{a}(x)]\\ q(x - y/2 ) , \\label{s_q_pi}\\ ] ] where the dynamic vertex @xmath65 $ ] with nonlocality size @xmath66 depends on the coordinates of the quark and antiquark ; @xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the quark and pion fields .",
    "the nonlocal vertex characterizes the coordinate dependence of order parameter for spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking and can be expressed in terms of the nonlocal quark condensates .    in the following calculations ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the approximation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath69 \\to f(y^2 , \\lambda^{-2 } ) , \\label{separable}\\ ] ] when the dynamic quark - pion vertex depends only on the relative coordinate of the quark and antiquark squared , @xmath70 , if neglecting the dependence of the vertex on angular variable @xmath71 .",
    "the fourier transform of the vertex function in the minkowski space is defined as @xmath72 with normalization @xmath73 , and we assume that it rapidly decreases in the euclidean region ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we also approximate the momentum - dependent quark self - energy in the quark propagator @xmath75 by a constant mass  @xcite and neglect small effects of the pion mass .",
    "we have to note that the approximations used are not fully consistent .",
    "in particular , due to neglecting the momentum dependence of the quark mass , some low - energy theorems are violated .",
    "further , as we show below , the choice of the model for the quark - pion vertex ( [ separable ] ) depending only on the relative coordinate induces a certain artifact in the @xmath14 behavior of da ( see below ) .",
    "however , these deficiencies of the approximation chosen are not essential for the present purposes and do not lead to essential numeric errors .",
    "the quark - pion coupling is given by the compositeness condition  @xcite @xmath76 and the pion weak decay constant is expressed by @xmath77 we have rescaled the integration variable by the quark mass squared and introduced the parameter @xmath78 that characterizes the diluteness of the qcd vacuum .",
    "within the instanton vacuum model , the size of nonlocality of the nonperturbative gluon field , @xmath79 , is much smaller than the quark compton length @xmath80 ; thus , @xmath81 is a small parameter  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the contribution to the @xmath82 invariant amplitude as calculated from the triangle diagrams : @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the photon polarization vectors , and @xmath85{\\hat { e}}_{1}s(k+p/2)\\}.\\ ] ] if the tensor @xmath86 is factorized from this amplitude , the form factor can be expressed as @xmath87 where the feynman integral @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 [ m_{q}^{2}-(k - p/2)^{2}-i\\varepsilon ] [ m_{q}^{2}-(k-(q_{1}-q_{2})/2)^{2}-i\\varepsilon ] } .",
    "\\label{ipigg}\\ ] ] within the constant - mass approximation , the low - energy relation following from the adler - bell - jackiw ( abj ) axial anomaly [ @xmath90 is well reproduced numerically with a relative error smaller than @xmath91  @xcite . in the formal limit of a very dilute vacuum medium @xmath92 ,",
    "the results are consistent with the abj anomaly and the goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "let us note that the integral ( [ ipigg ] ) is similar in structure to the integral arising in the lowest order of pqcd treating the quark - photon interaction perturbatively . in the latter case ,",
    "its asymptotic behavior is due to the subprocess @xmath93 with @xmath14 ( @xmath94 ) being the fraction of the pion momentum @xmath15 carried by the quark produced at the @xmath95 ( @xmath96 photon vertex .",
    "the relevant diagram is similar to the handbag diagram for hard exclusive processes , with the main difference that one should use , as a nonperturbative input , the quark - pion vertex instead of the pion da .",
    "as we see below , this similarity allows one to translate the form of the quark - pion vertex into a specific shape of the pion da .",
    "in this section , we estimate the asymptotics of the transition form factor . to this end , we rewrite the expression for integral ( [ ipigg ] ) in the form that is obtained after rotating to the euclidean space [ @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 , by using the feynman @xmath101parameterization for the denominators and integrating over the angular variables .",
    "then , the corresponding integral @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 ,   \\label{igpigg3}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 in this way , the expression ( [ igpigg3 ] ) can be safely analyzed in the asymptotic limit of high total virtuality of the photons @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , the integral over @xmath106 can be taken analytically , leading , in the chiral limit @xmath107 , to the asymptotic expression given by eq .",

    "( [ f_pi ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ igpigg2 ] ) it is clear , that the prediction of the nonperturbative approach about the asymptotic coefficient is rather sensitive to the product @xmath81 of the value of the constituent mass @xmath62 and the size of nonlocality @xmath66 of the vertex @xmath110 and to the relative distribution of the total virtuality among photons , @xmath111 . in particular , for the off - shell process @xmath112 in the kinematic case of symmetric distribution of photon virtualities , @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , the result obtained from eq .",
    "( [ igpigg2 ] ) is @xmath115 in agreement with the ope prediction  @xcite .",
    "let us note , that we use an approximation to the model with constant constituent quark masses for all three quark lines in the diagram of the process .",
    "however , the asymptotic result ( [ igpigg2 ] ) is independent of the value of the mass parameter in the quark propagator with hard momentum flow , as it should be .",
    "the other two quark lines remain soft during the process ; thus , the mass parameter @xmath62 may be considered as given on a certain characteristic soft scale in the momentum - dependent case @xmath116 .",
    "it means that the dynamic and kinematic dependence of @xmath117 found in ( [ igpigg2 ] ) will be unchanged , even if one includes the momentum dependence of the quark mass and considers the dressed quark - photon vertex which goes into the bare one , @xmath118 , as one of the squared quark momenta becomes infinite .",
    "both the expressions for @xmath60 derived within the nonlocal quark - pion model ( [ igpigg2 ] ) and from the light - cone ope ( [ j ] ) can be put into the common form @xmath119    \\label{r}\\ ] ] with @xmath120 and similar expressions for @xmath121 . equating both contributions",

    "( [ igpigg2 ] ) obtained within the nonlocal quark - pion model is equivalent to the standard lowest - order pqcd result ( [ j ] ) , with the only difference that the nonperturbative information accumulated in the pion da @xmath124 is represented by the quark - pion vertex function @xmath125 .",
    "we have to note that an explicit form of the asymptotic coefficient ( [ igpigg2 ] ) and the relation between the da and the vertex function depend on the model of quark - pion interaction ( [ s_q_pi ] ) . in particular , the expression ( [ wf_vf ] ) is obtained within the approximation ( [ separable ] ) , when the quark - pion vertex depends only on the relative coordinate .",
    "this approximation results in the artificial dependence of da on the modulo function of @xmath14 and leads to the nonsmooth behavior of the distribution at @xmath126 ( see fig .",

    "it is instructive to consider some extreme cases , depending on the physics under consideration .",
    "if the qcd vacuum were a very dilute vacuum @xmath146 , then the vertex function @xmath147 is a very slowly decaying function .",
    "this corresponds to the local quark - pion vertex . in that case",
    ", the coefficient @xmath148 goes logarithmically to infinity and the da also becomes flat @xmath149 .",
    "the latter can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ wf_vfdif ] ) , where the derivative of da with respect to @xmath14 is very small , since in this limit , the normalization factor @xmath150 becomes small . from ( [ wf_vf ] )",
    "it is clear that the integration region is effectively restricted from above by the scale @xmath151 and from below by @xmath152 .",
    "these scales are well separated in the region @xmath153 , where @xmath154 .",
    "it means that the da is suppressed at the edges of the kinematic interval @xmath155 , where quarks are soft .",
    "as it was pointed out earlier , the incorporation of nonperturbative effects results in the intrinsic transverse structure of hadronic wave functions @xcite , as well as the sudakov perturbative factor @xcite modifies the hard scattering picture of exclusive reactions and essentially improves it . as a result ,",
    "perturbative qcd calculations of the hadron form factors extend the kinematic region of self - consistency from asymptotic values of @xmath156 to the region starting from @xmath157 . in the opposite extreme case of a very dense medium ( heavy quark limit , @xmath158 ) , @xmath159 ,",
    "as it is predicted by the first term in the ope result @xcite . in that case , the limit @xmath160 is small , and the integrand in ( [ wf_vf ] ) is concentrated in the vicinity of @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the da becomes @xmath161 , as it is expected .",
    "as we shown above , a realistic situation is in - between these two extremes .",
    "these different situations are illustrated in terms of the pion da , ( [ wf_vf ] ) , in fig.1 .",
    "as it is clear from the figure , the model pion da , under the realistic choice of the parameter @xmath162 , is close to the asymptotic da . as noticed in the introduction , by considering the actual accessible data",
    ", the nonperturbative dynamics may dominate .",
    "therefore , the data turn out to be quite restrictive and uniquely indicate that the dilute regime is realized in the qcd vacuum . in fig .",
    "2 , for the process @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) , we plot the asymptotic coefficient @xmath165 as a function of the dynamical diluteness parameter squared @xmath166 . in this figure , we indicate the values of @xmath165 obtained from cleo data and model predictions . in fig .",

    "the first value of @xmath170 corresponds to the model estimate ; and the second one , to the central point of the cleo data fit .    to get further interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ wf_vf ] ) , we can express the da as the transverse momentum integral of the pion light - cone wave function @xcite @xmath171 rewriting the r.h.s . of ( [ wf_vf ] ) via the original variable @xmath172 and then substituting @xmath173 by the light - cone combination @xmath174 , that is the invariant mass of the @xmath175 pair squared , we identify the pion wave function as @xmath176 the vertex function @xmath177 in our model of the pion wave function plays a similar role as the sharp @xmath178-function in the  local duality \" wave function @xcite @xmath179 , with @xmath180 being the duality interval .",
    "note that numerically @xmath181 gev@xmath34 is close to the value of the nonlocality parameter @xmath182 .",
    "as in the case of ( [ wf_vf ] ) , the pion light - cone wave function ( [ psi ] ) displays non - analytic dependence on @xmath14 that disappears if a more realistic quark - pion vertex with the angular dependence is considered .",
    "recently , in @xcite , it was claimed that the schwinger - dyson approach predicts the same asymptotic coefficient @xmath183 for _ all _ nonlocal quark - photon vertices @xmath184 $ ] which go into the bare ones , @xmath118 , as soon as one of the squared momenta ( @xmath185 or @xmath186 ) becomes infinite ( as in the curtis - pennington  @xcite form of the vertex ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the quark propagator that depends on the photon momenta was approximated , at large @xmath26 , by its asymptotic form @xmath187 ^{-1}\\rightarrow 2/q^{2}$ ] .",
    "after this change , the integral ( [ ipigg ] ) attains the same form as the integral in ( [ f_pi ] ) defining @xmath109 . by taking into account the coefficients in front of the integrals of equations ( [ f_pi ] ) and ( [ gpiqq ] ) , one immediately reaches the conclusion of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) about the asymptotic coefficient ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "as we show above , such a quick asymptotic estimation is rather naive and does not lead to the accurate result .",
    "the approximation made in @xcite is justified only in the formal limit @xmath189 .",
    "our analysis is based on the consideration of a triangle diagram in which the quark propagator and quark - pion vertex are determined nonperturbatively . in this respect ,",
    "our approach is close to earlier work @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite , the approximations in the calculation of the triangle diagram were used that simplify the dynamics of the process .",
    "it turns out that these approximations are not justified in the kinematic region of large @xmath48 . as a result",
    "the expression was obtained for the asymptotic coefficient that is independent of the internal nonlocal structure of the pion .    in conclusion , within the covariant nonlocal model describing the quark - pion dynamics , we obtain the @xmath190 transition form factor at moderately high momentum transfers squared , where the perturbative qcd evolution does not yet reach the asymptotic regime . from the model calculations it is possible to find the absolute normalization of the asymptotic @xmath191 term .",
    "the asymptotic normalization coefficient @xmath192 , given in ( [ igpigg2 ] ) , depends on the ratio of the constituent quark mass on a certain soft scale to the characteristic size of qcd vacuum fluctuations and also on the kinematics of the process .",
    "this result does not confirm the statement about the universality of the asymptotic coefficient given in @xcite .",
    "when considering the dependence of the asymptotic coefficient on the internal dynamics , the cleo data are consistent with a small value of the diluteness parameter , which confirms the hypothesis about the small density of the instanton liquid vacuum  @xcite . from the comparison of the kinematic dependence of the asymptotic coefficient of the transition pion form factor , given by pqcd and the nonperturbative model , the new relation eq .",
