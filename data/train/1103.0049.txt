    "principal results of elastic scattering measurements are shown in figure  2 . as is observed in @xmath0 powders ,",
    "the most prominent feature in the elastic scattering data is a build - up of intense diffuse scattering at low temperatures .",
    "for the regime @xmath17 , theory predicts a spin - spiral state with enhanced diffuse scattering on a spherical surface in the lowest brillouin zone@xcite . what we have observed for @xmath0 single crystals",
    "is scattering centered about specific bragg locations with selection rules ( h k l ) all odd or ( h",
    "k l ) all even with h+k+l = 4n+2 for integer n. this observation implies that the short - range correlations reflect a tendency towards the collinear antiferromagnetic state expected for near - neighbor antiferromagnetic a - site spinels@xcite ( see figure  1(a ) . ) to explore the correlations in detail we performed radial and transverse scans across several magnetic bragg positions in the ( h h l ) scattering plane shown in figure  1(b ) . in figure  2(a ) , we plot radial scans across the ( 0 0 2 ) bragg position at three representative temperatures . the ( 0 0 2 ) peak was chosen for illustrative purposes because at this position the structural bragg peak has vanishing intensity while the magnetic scattering is strongest .",
    "a narrow , temperature - independent multiple - scattering peak is visible for t = 25 k and 11 k ( see supporting information ) .",
    "magnetic scattering is visible below 100 k and at high temperatures is a single peak that grows in intensity and decreases in width as the temperature is reduced ( see e.g. the broad scattering at 11 k in figure  2(a ) )",
    ". the lineshape changes at low temperatures , as discussed below .",
    "figure  2(b ) shows a map in the ( h h l ) plane of the elastic scattering at 2 k with that at 25 k subtracted .",
    "the signal is clearly centered on the ( 0 0 2 ) position and drops off to zero in all directions .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering is shown in detail in figures  2(c ) and ( d ) , where the multiple - scattering peak as determined by fits to high temperature data has been subtracted .",
    "the logarithmic intensity scale of panel ( c ) illustrates how the broad scattering at high temperatures narrows significantly and intensifies as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the increase in magnetic intensity is most dramatic as t approaches @xmath2=6.5 k , as demonstrated by panel(d ) showing a series of radial scans plotted on a linear scale for t @xmath18 10 k.    at high temperatures , the intensity of the diffuse scattering is well described by a single isotropic lorentzian function :    @xmath19    the conventional ornstein - zernicke form for short - range correlations above a magnetic phase transition@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the distance from the magnetic bragg point and the width parameter , @xmath21 , can be associated with the inverse magnetic correlation length . in figure  3(a ) , we show the heights and widths extracted from simultaneously fitting radial and transverse scans across ( 0 0 2 ) to eq .  1 up to t=25 k. as the temperature",
    "is lowered the strength and extent of the magnetic correlations grow smoothly until saturating at @xmath2 .",
    "the width of the magnetic diffuse scattering at low temperature is substantially larger than the instrumental resolution width shown as vertical black bars in figure  2(a ) .",
    "below @xmath2 , there is a qualitative change in lineshape , and a single lorentzian is no longer sufficient to describe the scattering .",
    "this is emphasized by the plot of @xmath22 in figure",
    "3(b ) showing the failure of the single lorentzian at low temperatures .",
    "it is further illustrated by the blue line in figure  2(a ) , which represents the best fit of a single lorentzian to the data at t=3.5 k. in fact the low temperature diffuse scattering can not be fit well by any physically reasonable single peak lineshape ( see details in supporting information ) ; below @xmath2 , a second component of the scattering emerges .",
    "the best description of the data is obtained by adding an additional anisotropic lorentzian - squared function peaked at the same position .",
    "accordingly , the neutron intensities below @xmath2 are fit to the two - component form :    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the distance from the magnetic bragg point , * g * , of momentum transfer parallel and perpendicular to * g * in the ( h h l ) scattering plane , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the respective peak widths in those directions .",
    "the quality of the fit for temperatures below 15 k is displayed in figure  3(b ) . at temperatures greater than @xmath2 the fit is not improved by adding a second component , however at low temperatures eq .",
    "2 is a far superior description of the data .",
    "the main panel of figure  3(c ) shows the relative heights of the two components to the scattering .",
    "the intensity of the lorentzian - squared component shows a sudden onset at a temperature that can be identified using linear extrapolation ( dashed line ) as 6.4@xmath280.5 k , equal within error to @xmath2 identified via bulk probes .",
    "the inset shows @xmath29 , a measure of the anisotropy of the lorentzian - squared component .",
    "in contrast , the lorentzian component remains isotropic at all temperatures .",
    "the strong temperature dependence and the observed lineshape below @xmath2 have important implications for the physics of @xmath0 .",
    "the abrupt emergence of an anisotropic lorentzian - squared component of the scattering may be a signature of a first - order phase transition at @xmath2 to a n@xmath1el ordered state .",
    "this can be understood through the following reasoning . as discussed earlier , below a discontinuous phase transition , ordered regions nucleate in one of the available degenerate ground states and grow until they meet . at this point , the sample volume consists of ordered domains separated by walls .",
    "an array of sharp domain walls gives rise to diffuse scattering with a lorentzian - squared lineshape@xcite , characteristic of the coarsening regime of first - order phase transition kinetics@xcite . if there is sufficient thermal energy , the large domains grow and the small ones disappear , resulting in narrower peaks in the diffuse scattering .",
    "when the temperature is low compared to the natural energetics of the system , as occurs in frustrated systems , the walls are kinetically frozen and the scattering remains broad .",
    "the lorentzian - squared peak observed below @xmath2 in @xmath0 suggests antiferromagnetic domains with average size of order 10 spins in each direction .",
    "the lorentzian component of the scattering below @xmath2 indicates that some fraction of the spins , most likely those located at walls , remains disordered .",
    "lorentzian - squared lineshapes have been observed before in frustrated magnets and spin glasses and have usually been attributed to random fields , possibly arising from impurities .",
    "we note however that the random field model should not be relevant to a clean single - crystal system with no applied field .",
    "moreover , although random fields can lead to lorentzian plus lorentzian - squared ( l+l@xmath30)scattering@xcite , in principle the @xmath21 parameters of each component should be equal , and there is no reason to expect anisotropy .",
    "in contrast , scattering arising from an array of domain walls is often anisotropic as a consequence of energetics@xcite .",
    "numerical calculations appropriate for @xmath0 ( see supporting information ) show that domain walls perpendicular to the ( h h 0 ) direction have a lower energy than those perpendicular to the ( 0 0 l ) direction .",
    "this leads to a smaller average distance between walls and hence broader lineshapes along ( h h 0 ) , consistent with experiment .",
    "given the specific predictions for @xmath0@xcite , it seems likely that the first - order nature of the transition can be attributed to the classical order - by - disorder mechanism .",
    "however , it is worth noting that any discontinuous magnetic transition in a frustrated system might be expected to demonstrate similar behavior .",
    "the saturation of the scattering width at value above the resolution width is inconsistent with a continuous transition , where one would expect the correlation length to diverge as the system approaches the transition temperature from above .",
    "a direct comparison of the current data with those above a continuous phase transition in a closely related system is provided in the supporting information .",
    "further evidence for the existence of n@xmath1el order in @xmath0 is provided by the appearance of dispersive spin - wave excitations at low temperatures .",
    "figures  4(a , b ) show single crystal inelastic neutron scattering spectra taken using the hb1 triple - axis spectrometer at the hfir for two representative wavevectors , including the magnetic zone boundary ( 1 0 3 ) .",
    "well below @xmath2 these show clear inelastic modes in addition to a peak centered on zero energy .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the inelastic peaks weaken and broaden as seen in the data at 25 k. the wavevector dependence of the mode energies in three symmetry directions is depicted in figures  4(c)-(e ) and the mode intensity along the ( 0 0 l ) direction is plotted in figures  4(f ) .",
    "the solid red lines in figures  4(c)-(f ) are generated by fitting the available data to a spin - wave model ( see supporting information ) based on the heisenberg hamiltonian with nearest ( next - nearest ) neighbor exchange parameters @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and effective anisotropy field @xmath31@xcite .",
    "the model gives an excellent description of the data , with inferred exchange parameter values @xmath32  mev and @xmath33  mev .",
    "this implies @xmath34 , close to the critical value of @xmath9 .",
    "the best fits also yield a small but finite value for single - ion anisotropy , @xmath35 = 0.018 @xmath28 0.006  mev , implying the existence of a gap in the spectrum .    to resolve the low - energy excitations at the magnetic zone center , cold neutron inelastic scattering measurements were made using the cold neutron chopper spectrometer instrument at the sns .",
    "the main results are summarized in figure  5 . a representative energy - momentum slice of this data taken at t = 1.5 k is plotted in figure  5(a ) , with the expected spin - wave prediction superimposed .",
    "the adjacent figure  5(b ) is a cut through this data at the magnetic zone center ( dashed line ) .",
    "the spectrum at base temperature shows a well - defined magnon peak at the magnetic zone center with a small gap @xmath36  mev , in good agreement with extrapolations from the triple axis data .",
    "the observation of a well - defined magnon at the zone center argues against a short - range ordered glassy state .",
    "the presence of a gap may be significant , since recent monte carlo calculations have suggested that a single - ion anisotropy is necessary to stabilize n@xmath1el order in @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the gap likely arises from the effect of spin - orbit coupling which is known to be important for the @xmath37 ion in a tetrahedral environment@xcite , and incidentally provides an explanation for the enhanced local moment inferred from bulk magnetization measurements@xcite .",
    "finite domain size effects may also play a role .",
    "figure  5(c ) , shows an identical data slice at t=8.1 k , just above @xmath2 .",
    "figure  5(d ) directly compares energy cuts for the two temperatures . at 8.1",
    "k the elastic intensity and spin - wave mode easily resolved at low temperature give way to significant quasi - elastic scattering , more typical of a disordered system .",
    "the temperature dependence of the zone center scattering was characterized by fitting the energy cuts to the following form :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a gaussian with width determined by energy resolution describing elastic scattering from the n@xmath1el - ordered domains , @xmath40 is a lorentzian parameterizing the quasi - elastic scattering , and @xmath41 is a damped harmonic oscillator term describing the magnon .",
    "the functions are normalized to unit area with @xmath40 and @xmath41 constructed to satisfy detailed balance .",
    "( see supporting information for explicit definitions of fitting functions . )",
    "the integrated intensities of the elastic ( @xmath42 ) and quasi - elastic ( @xmath43 ) components are plotted vs. temperature in figure  5(e ) . as expected",
    ", the elastic intensity rapidly dies off above @xmath2 . the spectral weight of the lorentzian component increases with temperature up to 8k , weakening slightly at 10.3k .",
    "this implies that it is associated with the isotropic lorentzian component of the q - dependent elastic scattering .",
    "the data presented here call for a reconsideration of the physical picture describing @xmath0 , and may have more general implications for additional frustrated magnetic systems . until now",
    ", the behavior of @xmath0 below @xmath2 has largely been thought of as characteristic of a glassy state , possibly arising from disorder associated with cation site inversion .",
    "the single crystals measured here have minimal site inversion , and the current data supports the idea that @xmath2 may instead be associated with a first - order phase transition .",
    "this interpretation naturally explains reports of magnetic order in some powder neutron diffraction@xcite and esr@xcite measurements .",
    "the resultant domain structure is out of equilibrium , consistent with the observed irreversibility in magnetization measurements@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the discontinuities associated with a first - order phase transition become very small on approaching a tricritical point , consistent with the linear temperature dependence of the intensity of the lorentzian - squared scattering in figure  3(c ) , as well as the rounded peak observed in heat capacity measurements .",
    "moreover , heat capacity measurements made with the time relaxation technique have well - known and documented problems handling latent heat@xcite and generally will not exhibit of a strong anomaly near a weak first - order phase transition .",
    "the diamond - lattice antiferromagnet with dominant nearest neighbor interactions is expected to exhibit a continuous phase transition to the collinear n@xmath1el state . in this respect ,",
    "the first - order nature of the transition is surprising , and in light of the theoretical work of bergman _ _ et al.__@xcite , it is natural to associate it with the physics of frustration and perhaps the order - by - disorder mechanism .",
    "it appears that the physics of @xmath0 has common features with the closely related fcc heisenberg antiferromagnet which is also expected from theory to exhibit order - by - disorder physics@xcite .",
    "interestingly , monte carlo calculations on the fcc system@xcite reveal that domain walls have a significant effect and inhibit the apparent magnitude of the ordered sublattice magnetization . alternatively , the recent work of savary _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite suggests that the ground state properties of certain diamond - lattice antiferromagnets are strongly affected by relatively small amounts of disorder , perhaps enhancing the propensity of @xmath0 to form an actual spin glass and leading to strong sample - dependence .",
    "we also note certain similarities between the current results and the two length scales observed in the scattering of order - by - disorder candidate @xmath44@xcite , although the latter exhibits a continuous phase transition and resolution - limited bragg peaks at low temperatures .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again however that the current picture of kinetically inhibited order relies on very few assumptions and may be more generally applicable to systems beyond those which demonstrate order - by - disorder physics .",
    "first - order phase transitions are predicted for a number of different reasons including dipolar interactions@xcite and magneto - elastic coupling@xcite , and we believe the picture proposed here for @xmath0 is more common than is currently appreciated . the origin of glassy behavior in relatively clean systems is a problem of current interest in the study of rare - earth pyrochlore systems@xcite .",
    "observations of l+l@xmath30 lineshapes in elastic neutron scattering exist for some of these systems but remain unexplained@xcite .",
    "it would very interesting to investigate whether or not there is a universal origin for these features .",
    "we believe @xmath0 is a prototypical example of an important class of frustrated magnets where apparent glassy behavior is actually a signature of kinetically inhibited magnetic order .",

    "it contributes a small fraction of the total intensity at the precise peak position , and no intensity whatsoever to the wings of the magnetic scattering .",

    "as mentioned in the main article , magnetic scattering at the ( 0 0 2 ) reciprocal lattice position was well - described by an isotropic lorentzian function at temperatures greater than @xmath2 . upon cooling through this temperature though , a sudden change in the lineshape was observed . to explore the form of the scattering function at low temperatures , radial and transverse scans across the ( 0 0 2 ) reciprocal lattice position were fit simultaneously to a number of different functions .",

    "each function was either constrained to be isotropic ( i ) are allowed to be anisotropic ( a ) .",
    "as is clear from the quality - of - fit parameters , no single - component function describes the data well at lowest temperature , nor does any perfectly isotropic function .",
    "in fact , by a large margin , the peak functions described by a lorentzian and an anisotropic lorentzian - squared function give the best description of the data . in these fits ,",
    "the anisotropy ratio of the width parameters for the lorentzian - squared component , @xmath77 , ranges from 0.3 to 0.7 .",
    "if one allows the width parameters describing the lorentzian component to vary independently in the radial and transverse directions , with the single exception of the data at t=2k the resulting best fits yield a width parameter equal to 1 within 3% and no improvement in the quality of fit as measured by the normalized @xmath22 .",
    "the data at 2 k exhibits a difference of 10% .",
    "it is important to note that the conclusions reached here are unaffected by the inclusion of instrument resolution in the fits .",
    "as mentioned and shown graphically in figure  2 of the main article , the width of the elastic scattering peak is significantly larger than the resolution widths .",
    "it has been verified that the @xmath78 form remains the most accurate description of the data when the effects of resolution are included .",
    "moreover , inferred signal anisotropy of the lorentzian - squared term is in fact accentuated by the inclusion of resolution , as the resolution ellipsoid is considerably broader in the ( 0 0 l ) than the ( h h 0 ) direction at the ( 0 0 2 ) reciprocal lattice position .",
    "as argued in the main article , the anisotropy of the diffuse scattering widths in @xmath0 at lowest temperatures can be naturally interpreted as a signature of preferred wall orientation in a n@xmath1el ordered state with domains . specifically , the broader observed linewidth in the ( 1 1 0 ) relative to the ( 0 0 1 ) crystallographic direction implies a shorter distance between domain walls in that direction .    to follow up on this idea , we numerically estimated the number of nearest and next - nearest neighbor bonds broken by an anti - phase domain wall of each orientation in an n@xmath79n@xmath79n array of cubic cells containing the n@xmath1el order for different values of n. we then extrapolated these estimations to n@xmath80 .",
    "the energy of a wall was then derived from the total energy cost ( gain ) of breaking nearest - neighbor ( next - nearest - neighbor ) bonds via : @xmath81 here , we used the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 extracted from fits of inelastic data to linear spin - wave theory .",
    "results for walls oriented normal to the ( 0 0 1 ) and ( 1 1 0 ) directions are listed in table  s2 .",
    "consistent with experiment , walls oriented normal to the ( 0 0 1 ) direction have a higher estimated energy cost per unit area , implying a larger distance between such walls and a narrower neutron scattering line - width in that direction .",
    "at temperatures greater than the magnetic transition temperature , the current study observes intense lorentzian - like elastic scattering which grows in intensity and correlation length ( inversely proportional to peak width ) as @xmath82 is approached from above .",
    "importantly though , the magnetic correlation lengths are seen to saturate at a value of @xmath8333 , which is much shorter than the resolution length of the instrument .",
    "this is in direct contrast to the behavior above a continuous phase transition to long - range order , where correlation lengths are seen to diverge .    to emphasize this point , we plot in figure  s4 the fitted values of @xmath21 from the isotropic lorentzian component of the scattering in @xmath0 and compare to equivalent data from a separate study of @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath84 is also a diamond - lattice antiferromagnet , but has a smaller @xmath6 and a continuous phase transition to long - range n@xmath1el order at @xmath82=39 k@xcite .",
    "notably , the @xmath84 data shown here are from a sample with a larger level of cation inversion , and thus greater amount of disorder , than the current crystal of @xmath0 . nevertheless , the extent of ornstein - zernicke correlations at the transition temperature is much longer in the @xmath85 material .",
    "comparisons such as this provide further evidence that a continuous transition is avoided in @xmath0 .",
    "the linear spin - wave predictions used to fit inelastic data in the main text were based on the derivations of lovesey@xcite and are laid out below . consider the following hamiltonian for an antiferromagnet described by two interpenetrating lattices , * m * and * n * , containing spin - up and spin - down moments , respectively : @xmath86    here , * r * is defined to be any vector which connects nearest - neighbors ( coupling opposite sublattices ) , * * r**@xmath87 is any vector which connects next - nearest neighbors ( n.n . on a single sublattice ) and @xmath31 is an effective field along the ( arbitrarily chosen ) * z*-axis included to parameterize a possible uniaxial anisotropy .",

    "one candidate is spin - orbit coupling in the form of a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , allowed here since the diamond lattice breaks bond inversion symmetry .",
    "as mentioned previously , spin - orbit coupling has long been known to be important in systems with @xmath37 ions in a tetrahedral environment and can explain the enhanced local moment inferred from high - temperature magnetization measurements@xcite .",

    "<S> frustration occurs in spin systems when constraints prevent the formation of a ground state satisfying all of the pairwise interactions . </S>",

    "<S> noteworthy examples include unusual short - range correlations@xcite , apparent spin - glass behavior in the absence of disorder@xcite , collective ring excitations in pyrochlore spinels@xcite , spontaneously reduced dimensionality in rare - earth titanates@xcite , and topological excitations like magnetic monopoles in spin - ice materials@xcite </S>",

    "<S> examples include dipolar interactions in the pyrochlores@xcite or spin - lattice interactions in multiferroics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , degeneracy can also be broken in the complete absence of such interaction terms , through a mechanism known as ` order - by - disorder'@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> order - by - disorder refers to the scenario where the entropy associated with thermal or quantum fluctuations lowers the free energy of one ordered state compared to others of equal energy , thereby stabilizing order . </S>",
    "<S> order - by - disorder was first predicted in studies of the diluted ising model on a rectangular lattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has since emerged as a central feature in theories of various frustrated antiferromagnets , including the face - centered cubic ( fcc)@xcite as well as some pyrochlore@xcite and two - dimensional lattices@xcite . despite the long history and ubiquity in theoretical models , </S>",
    "<S> few , if any , real materials have been found that exhibit this important phenomenon clearly .    </S>",
    "<S> the classical ( i.e. thermal - fluctuation induced ) order - by - disorder mechanism often results in a first - order phase transition@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> wall motion must be driven by thermal energy that is sufficient to overcome the magnetic interactions that dominate the surface energy of the walls . since this condition is not met , the system is kinetically frozen in a state with small domains , and even though it is ordered , it can seem to exhibit glassy behavior regardless of the level of chemical disorder . to our knowledge , this scenario has not been proposed in the literature on frustrated magnets . however </S>",

    "<S> theoretical investigations@xcite have revealed particularly interesting physics in the diamond - lattice antiferromagnets arising from the frustrating effects of competing exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the diamond - lattice antiferromagnet with only nearest - neighbor exchange ( @xmath5 ) is not frustrated and orders with a collinear ground state as illustrated in figure  1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lattice has only 4 nearest - neighbors versus 12 next - nearest - neighbors coupled via second neighbor exchange , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even moderate @xmath6 is predicted to suppress the collinear order , leading to highly degenerate spin - liquid ground states@xcite with order - by - disorder type transitions at low temperatures driven by thermal@xcite or quantum fluctuations@xcite . in particular </S>",
