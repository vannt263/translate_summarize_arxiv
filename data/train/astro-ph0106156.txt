    "the time evolution of the gravitational collapse of perturbations in decelerating , isothermal shocked layers has been examined numerically and analytically using linearized equations by elmegreen ( 1994 ) . in this paper",
    ", we continue with nonlinear analysis of the gravitational instability of spherically symmetric shells expanding into the stationary homogeneous medium .",
    "we modify the approach adopted by fuchs ( 1996 ) who described the fragmentation of uniformly rotating self - gravitating disks .",
    "the inclusion of higher order terms helps to determine with better accuracy when , where and how quickly the fragmentation happens .",
    "formation rates and the mass distribution function of fragments are derived from simulations and compared to the observed mass spectrum of molecular clouds .",
    "equations as derived by w \" unsch & palou ( 2001 ) are    @xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the expansion velocity of the shell , @xmath4 is mass in the area @xmath5 on the surface of the shell , and @xmath6 denotes a two dimensional velocity of surface flows .",
    "@xmath7 is the surface density , @xmath8 is the constant isothermal sound speed inside the cold shell , @xmath9 is the gravitational potential generated by the mass distribution in the shell , g is the gravitational constant and @xmath10 is a delta function of the space coordinate @xmath11 perpendicular to the surface of the shell .      the solution of linearized eq .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) may be written in the form of exponential functions for the perturbations : @xmath12 ( perturbed surface density ) and @xmath13 . the shell starts to be gravitationally unstable when @xmath14 is purely imaginary and negative .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the radius and @xmath16 the unperturbed surface density of the shell .",
    "@xmath17 is the angular frequency , in the case of instability @xmath18 gives the perturbation growth rate , and @xmath19 the wave number of perturbations .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath16 and of @xmath20 , is shown in fig .",
    "1 for shell expanding in the homogeneous medium of the constant volume density 1 @xmath21 and average atomic weight 1.3 .",
    "the total energy released is @xmath22 erg and @xmath8 = 1 km s@xmath23 .",
    "w \" unsch & palou ( 2001 ) include quadratic terms into equations for the evolution of perturbations . the time evolution of the perturbed maximum surface density including nonlinear terms , @xmath24 , is given in fig .",
    "1 . as another result of the nonlinear analysis fig . 2 shows the spatial distribution of the surface density and velocity vectors of the surface flows resulting from mode interactions .",
    "after the time when the shell becomes unstable , the mass of the fragment decreases as its size decreases . later",
    ", the inflow of mass begins to dominate ( surface flows are shown in fig .",
    "2 ) and the fragment mass grows .",
    "masses of individual fragments are between a few times @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the highest frequency around @xmath27 .",
    "another consequence of the dispersion relation ( 4 ) is that the most massive fragments , corresponding to the smallest unstable wave number @xmath19 , form very slowly .",
    "therefore , the most massive clouds are created at the latest stages of the shell evolution .",
    "the mass spectrum of fragments is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "its decreasing part can be approximated with a power law @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "this is quite close to the observed mass spectrum of gmc in the milky way .",
    "combes ( 1991 ) gives @xmath30 .",
    "nanten survey of the co emission of the lmc ( fukui , 2001 ) gives steeper slope : @xmath31 , which may be connected to higher level of random motions in the lmc compared to the milky way , which restricts the formation of late time massive fragments in the lmc and steepens their mass spectrum .",
