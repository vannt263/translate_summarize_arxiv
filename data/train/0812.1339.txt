    "non - linear partial differential equations ( pde s ) are distinguished by the fact that , starting from smooth initial data , they can develop a singularity in finite time @xcite .",
    "very often , such a singularity corresponds to a physical event , such as the solution ( e.g. a physical flow field ) changing topology , and/or the emergence of a new ( singular ) structure , such as a tip , cusp , sheet , or jet . on the other hand",
    ", a singularity can also imply that some essential physics is missing from the equation in question , which should thus be supplemented with additional terms .",
    "( even in the latter case , the singularity may still be indicative of a real physical event ) .",
    "consider for example the physical case shown in fig .",

    "shown is a snapshot of one viscous fluid dripping into another fluid , close to the point where a drop of the inner fluid pinches off .",
    "this process is driven by surface tension , which tries to minimise the surface area between the two fluids . at a particular point",
    "@xmath0 in space and time , the local radius @xmath1 of the fluid neck goes to zero ; this point is a singularity of the underlying equation of motion . since the drop breaks into two pieces , there is no way the problem can be continued without generalising the formulation to one that includes topological changes .",
    "however , in this review we adopt a broader view of what constitutes a singularity . we consider it as such whenever there is a loss of regularity , which implies that there is a length scale which goes to zero .",
    "this is the situation under which one expects self - similar behaviour , which is our guiding principle .",
    "cm , the viscosity ratio is @xmath2 . ]",
    "a fascinating aspect of the study of singularities is that they describe a great variety of phenomena which appear in the natural sciences and beyond @xcite .",
    "some examples of such singular events occur in free - surface flows @xcite , turbulence and euler dynamics ( singularities of vortex tubes @xcite and sheets @xcite ) , elasticity @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , non - linear wave physics @xcite , bacterial growth @xcite , black - hole cosmology @xcite , and financial markets @xcite .    in this paper we consider evolution equations @xmath3 ,   \\label{ge}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] represents some ( nonlinear ) differential or integral operator .",
    "we will also discuss cases where @xmath5 is a vector , and thus ( [ ge ] ) is a system of equations .",
    "furthermore , the spatial variable @xmath6 may also have several dimensions , and thus potentially different scaling in different coordinate directions .",
    "we will cite some examples below , but few of the higher - dimensional cases have so far been analysed in detail .",
    "for the purpose of the following discussion , let us suppose that both @xmath6 and @xmath5 are scalar quantities , and that the singularity occurs at a single point in space and time @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we are looking for local solutions of ( [ ge ] ) which have the structure @xmath9 with appropriately chosen values of the exponents @xmath10 .",
    "note that later the prime is also used to indicate a derivative",
    ". however , this will always be with respect to a spatial variable like @xmath11 , or the similarity variable @xmath12 , hence confusion should not arise .",
    "giga and kohn @xcite proposed to introduce self - similar variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 to study the asymptotics of blow up .",
    "namely , putting @xmath15 ( [ ge ] ) is turned into the `` dynamical system '' @xmath16\\equiv \\alpha h - \\beta\\xi h_{\\xi } + f[h ] .",
    "\\label{ds}\\ ] ] by virtue of ( [ ds ] ) , solutions to the original pde ( [ ge ] ) for given initial data can be viewed as orbits in some infinite dimensional phase phase , for instance , @xmath17 . to understand the blow - up of ( [ ge ] ) , giga and kohn proposed to study the long - time behaviour of the _ dynamical system _ ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "thus in particular , one is interested in the attractors of ( [ ds ] ) ( @xmath18-limit sets in the notation which is customary in the context of partial differential equations , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if ( [ ss ] ) is indeed a solution of ( [ ge ] ) , the right hand side of ( [ ds ] ) is _ independent _ of @xmath19 , and self - similar solutions of the form ( [ ss ] ) are _ fixed points _ of ( [ ds ] ) , which we will denote by @xmath20 . by studying the dynamics close to the fixed point",
    ", we find that the dynamical system ( [ ds ] ) frequently reduces to very few dimensions .",
    "thus on one hand one obtains detailed information on the behaviour of the original problem ( [ ge ] ) near blowup . on the other hand ,",
    "one also gains a fruitful means of _ classifying _ , or at least _ characterising _ singularities .",
    "the most basic linear stability analysis of this self - similar solution consists in linearising around the fixed point according to @xmath21 which gives @xmath22 where @xmath23 depends on the fixed point solution @xmath24 . to solve ( [ sd_lin ] ) , we write @xmath25 as a superposition of eigenfunctions @xmath26 of the operator @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the eigenvalue : @xmath30    in the cases we know , the spectrum turns out to be discrete . for evolution pde s involving second order elliptic differential operators , such as semilinear parabolic equations , mean",
    "curvature or ricci flows , the discreteness of the spectrum of the linearisation about the fixed point is a direct consequence of sturm - liouville theory @xcite .",
    "this theory establishes that , under quite general conditions on the coefficients of a second order linear differential operator and the boundary conditions , its spectrum is discrete and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete set in a suitably weighed @xmath17 space .",
    "some explicit examples are presented in subsection [ quad ] . for general linear operators such",
    "a theory is not available , and one has to study the spectrum case by case .",
    "now the solution of ( [ sd_lin ] ) corresponding to @xmath26 is @xmath31 and all eigenvalues need to be negative for the similarity solution to be stable . in that case ,",
    "convergence to the fixed point is exponential , or _ algebraic _ in the original time variable @xmath32 . soon the solution has effectively reached the fixed point , and there is very little change in the self - similar behaviour . if one or several of the eigenvalues around the fixed point vanish , the approach to the fixed point is slow , and the dynamics is effectively described by a dynamical system whose dimension corresponds to the number of vanishing eigenvalues .",
    "the same holds true if the attractor has few dimensions ( such as a limit cycle or a low - dimensional chaotic attractor ) .",
    "thus although singular behaviour is in principle a problem to be solved in infinite dimensions , in practise it typically reduces to a dynamical problem of few dimensions . in this review we analyse singularities from the point of view of the _ slow dynamics _ contained in ( [ ds ] ) , to obtain an overview and tentative classification of possible scaling behaviours .",
    "we also emphasise the physical significance of these different types of behaviours .",
    "the perspective described above suggests a close relationship to the description of scaling phenomena by means of the renormalisation group , developed in the context of critical phenomena @xcite ; we will continue to point out similarities , but we are not aware that a classification similar to ours has been achieved using the language of the renormalisation group . for a computational perspective on analysing ( [ ds ] ) in terms of its slow dynamics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "finally , another approach sometimes associated with the classification of singularities is catastrophe theory @xcite . however , as far as we are aware catastrophe theory only yields useful results if the problem can be mapped onto a low - dimensional geometrical problem , which can in turn be rephrased in terms of normal forms of polynomials .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for wave problems such as shock formation and wave breaking @xcite , as well as singularities of the eikonal equation @xcite and related problems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the following cases :    1 .",
    "_ stable fixed points _ ( section [ fixed ] ) + in this case the fixed point is approached exponentially in the logarithmic variable @xmath19 , so the dynamics is described by the self - similar law ( [ ss ] ) .",

    "centre manifold _",
    "( section [ sec : centre ] ) + here one or more of the eigenvalues around the fixed point are zero . as a result ,",
    "the approach to the fixed point is only algebraic , leading to logarithmic corrections to scaling .",

    "this implies that the solid surface is smooth and does not exhibit facets , coming from the underlying crystal structure .",
    "above the roughening transition , a continuum description is still possible @xcite .",

    "solutions of ( [ sdsim ] ) have been studied extensively in @xcite . to ensure matching to a time - independent outer solution , the leading order time dependence must drop out from ( [ ssd ] ) , implying that @xmath83 the general form of this matching condition for self - similar solutions of the form ( [ ss ] ) is @xmath84 all solutions of the similarity equation ( [ sd ] ) , and which obey the growth condition ( [ bound ] ) are symmetric , and form a discretely infinite set @xcite , similar to a number of other problems discussed below .",

    "other physical problems which frequently involve anomalous scaling exponents are strong explosions on one hand , and collapse of particles or gases into a singular state on the other .",

    "the type of scaling depends on the details of the underlying physics , and scaling of both the first and second kind is observed .",
    "for example , the radius of a shock wave resulting from a strong explosion can be calculated from dimensional analysis to be @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "however , in the seemingly analogous case of a strong _ implosion _ , an anomalous exponent is observed , which moreover depends on the parameters of the problem @xcite .",
    "cases were collapse and shock formation coincide were given by @xcite ( similar to section [ shock ] above ) .",
    "in a somewhat different context , anomalous scaling is observed in model calculations for the collapse of self - gravitating particles @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "it is important to remember that these examples come from _",
    "kinetic _ equations describing the stochastic collision of waves or particles , and hence involving nonlocal collision operators . however , the kinetic equations appear to be closely related to certain pde problems @xcite , which are analogous to other evolution equations studied in this article .",
    "self - similar solutions correspond to fixed points of the dynamical system ( [ ds ] ) , whose stability we now investigate by linearising around the fixed point .",
    "we explain the situation for the example of section [ sub : first ] in more detail , for which the transformation reads @xmath96 where @xmath97 . the similarity form of ( [ sd ] ) becomes @xmath98_{\\xi } , \\label{mean_dyn}\\ ] ] which reduces to ( [ sdsim ] ) if the left hand side is set to zero . to assure matching of ( [ mean_dyn ] ) to the outer solution",
    ", we have to require that ( [ ssmean ] ) is to leading order time - independent as @xmath12 is large , which leads to the boundary condition @xmath99 this is the natural extension of ( [ bound ] ) to the time - dependent case .",
    "next we linearise around any one of the similarity solutions @xmath100 listed in table [ series ] , as described in the introduction .",
    "the stability is controlled by eigenvalues of the eigenvalue equation ( [ mean_lyn ] ) .",
    "inserting the eigensolution ( [ eigen_exp ] ) into ( [ bcsd ] ) one finds that @xmath26 must grow at infinity like @xmath101 similarly , the growth condition for the general case of a similarity solution of the form ( [ ss ] ) is @xmath102    if the similarity solution @xmath20 is to be stable , the real part of the eigenvalues of @xmath27 must be negative .",
    "however , there are always two positive eigenvalues , which are related to the invariance of the equation of motion ( [ sd ] ) under translations in space and time , as noted by @xcite .",
    "namely , for any @xmath103 , the translated similarity solution @xmath104 is an equally good self - similar solution of ( [ sd ] ) , and thus of ( [ mean_dyn ] ) . in particular",
    ", we can expand ( [ trans ] ) to lowest order in @xmath103 , and find that @xmath105 where the linear term is a solution of ( [ sd_lin ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath106 but this means that @xmath107 is an eigenvalue of @xmath27 with eigenfunction @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , considering the transformation @xmath109 , one finds a second positive eigenvalue @xmath110 , with eigenfunction @xmath111 .",
    "however , these two positive eigenvalues _ do not _ correspond to instability . instead",
    ", the meaning of these eigenvalues is that upon perturbing the similarity solution , the singularity time as well as the position of the singularity will change",
    ". thus if the coordinate system is not adjusted accordingly , it looks as if the solution would flow away from the fixed point .",
    "if , on the other hand , the solution is represented relative to the perturbed values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the eigenvalues @xmath114 and @xmath115 will not appear .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ mean_lyn ] ) was studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "it was found that each similarity solution @xmath116 has exactly @xmath117 positive real eigenvalues , _ disregarding _ @xmath118 .",
    "the result is that the linearisation around the `` ground state '' solution @xmath119 only has negative eigenvalues while _ all _ the other solutions have at least one other positive eigenvalue .",
    "this means that @xmath119 is the only similarity solution that can be observed , all other solutions are unstable .",
    "close to the fixed point , the approach to @xmath119 will be dominated by the largest negative eigenvalue @xmath120 : @xmath121 .",
    "\\label{approach}\\ ] ] for large arguments , the point @xmath122 where the correction becomes comparable to the similarity solution is @xmath123 , and thus @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the region of validity of @xmath20 _ expands _ in similarity variables , and is constant in real space .",
    "this rapid convergence is reflected by the numerical results reported in fig .",
    "[ sdfig ] .",
    "more formally , one can say that for any @xmath103 there is a @xmath125 such that @xmath126 if @xmath127 _ uniformly _ as @xmath128 .",
    "we suspect that the situation described above is more general : the ground state is stable , while each following profile has a number of additional eigenvalues . in the case of the sequence of profiles @xmath116 of ( [ sdsim ] ) , two new positive eigenvalues appear for each new profile , corresponding to a symmetric and an antisymmetric eigenfunction .",
    "below we give two more examples of the same scenario , for which we are able to give a simple geometrical interpretation for the appearance of two additional positive eigenvalues at each stage of the hierarchy of similarity solutions .",
    "the simplest case is that of shock wave formation ( cf .",
    "section [ shock ] ) , for which everything can be worked out analytically .",
    "the dynamical system corresponding to the self - similar solution ( [ be_scal ] ) is @xmath129 and so the eigenvalue equation for perturbations @xmath25 around the base profile @xmath130 becomes @xmath131 here @xmath130 is the ith similarity function defined by ( [ be_impl ] ) for the exponents @xmath132 as given by ( [ be_alpha ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalue equation ( [ be_ev ] ) is solved easily by transforming from the variable @xmath12 to the variable @xmath133 , using ( [ be_impl ] ) : @xmath134 = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial\\overline{u } } \\left[\\alpha_i\\overline{u}_i + ( 1+\\alpha_i)\\overline{u}_i^{2i+3}\\right ] , \\label{be_ev_tr}\\ ] ] with solution @xmath135 the exponent @xmath136 must be an integer for ( [ be_ev_sol ] ) to be regular at the origin , so the eigenvalues are @xmath137 as usual , the eigensolutions are alternating between even and odd",
    ". however , we are interested in the _ first _ instance , given by ( [ first ] ) , at which a shock forms .",
    "this implies that the second derivative of the profile must vanish at the location of the shock , and the amplitude of the @xmath138 perturbation must be exactly zero .",
    "thus for @xmath139 the remaining eigenvalues are @xmath140 ; the first two are the eigenvalues @xmath141 and @xmath142 found above .",
    "the vanishing eigenvalue occurs because there is a family of solutions parameterised by the coefficient @xmath143 in ( [ be_impl ] ) .",
    "all the other eigenvalues are negative , which shows that the similarity solution ( [ be_alpha1 ] ) is stable . in the same vein , for @xmath144 there are two more positive exponents : @xmath145 , so the solution must be unstable .",
    "the same is of course true for all higher order solutions .",
    "thus in conclusion the ground state solution @xmath146 given by ( [ be_alpha1 ] ) is the only observable form of shock formation .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in @xcite by a stability analysis based on catastrophe theory .",
    "the sequence of profiles for viscous pinch - off , found in section [ second ] , suggests a simple mechanism for the fact that two new unstable directions appear with each new similarity profile of higher order .",
    "in fact , the argument is strikingly similar to that given for shock formation . differentiating ( [ visc ] ) with respect to @xmath147 one finds that a local minimum point @xmath148 remains a minimum .",
    "thus the local time evolution of the profile can be written as @xmath149 for generic initial data @xmath150 , so there is no reason why @xmath151 should vanish at the singular time , which means that the self - similar solution @xmath152 will develop , which has a quadratic minimum .",
    "this situation is structurally stable , so one expects the eigenvalues of the linearisation to be negative .",
    "if however the coefficients @xmath153 are zero for @xmath154 , they will remain zero for all times .",
    "namely , if the first @xmath155 @xmath147-derivatives of @xmath5 vanish , one has @xmath156 so the first @xmath155 derivatives will remain zero .",
    "thus to find the similarity profile with @xmath157 , one needs @xmath158 as an initial condition .",
    "this is a non - generic situation , and a slight perturbation will make @xmath151 and @xmath159 nonzero . in other words , there are two unstable directions , which take the solution away from @xmath160 , as defined by ( [ cond ] ) . in the general case , the linearisation around @xmath161 will have @xmath117 positive eigenvalues ( apart from the trivial ones ) .",
    "extensive numerical simulations of drop pinch - off in the inertial - surface tension - viscous regime ( cf .",
    "section [ thin ] ) suggests that the the hierarchy of similarity solutions again has similar properties in this case as well , although stability has not been studied theoretically .",
    "the ground - state profile is stable , while all the others are unstable @xcite .",
    "even when using a higher - order similarity solution as an initial condition , it is immediately destabilised , and converges onto the ground state solution @xcite .",
    "in section [ fixed ] we described the generic situation that the behaviour of a similarity solution is determined by the linearisation around it . in the case of a stable fixed point , convergence is exponentially fast , and the observed behaviour is essentially that of the fixed point . in this section , we describe a variety different cases where the the dynamics is slow . in all cases we are able to associate this slow dynamics with a fixed point in the appropriate variable(s ) ,",
    "around which the eigenvalues vanish . instead , higher - order non - linear terms have to be taken into account , and the slow approach to the fixed point is determined by a low - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "we consider essentially two different cases :    * the dynamical system ( [ ds ] ) possesses a fixed point @xmath85 , which has a _ vanishing _ eigenvalue , with corresponding eigenfunction @xmath162 .",
    "the dynamics in the slow direction @xmath36 is described by a nonlinear equation for the amplitude @xmath163 , which varies on a logarithmic time scale : @xmath164 ,   \\quad \\xi = x'/t'^{\\beta } .",
    "\\label{model1}\\ ] ] * the dynamical system does not possess a fixed point , but has a solution of a slightly more general form : @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are not necessarily power laws . to expand about a fixed point",
    ", we define the generalised exponents @xmath168 which now depend on time . in the case of a type - i similarity solution , this reduces to the usual definition of the exponent . in the cases considered below , one derives a finite dimensional dynamical system for the exponents @xmath10 ( potentially including other , similarly defined scale factors ) .",

    "first , the presence of logarithms implies that there is some dependence on initial conditions built into the description .",
    "the reason is that the argument inside the logarithm needs to be non - dimensionalised using some `` external '' time scale .",
    "more formally , any change in time scale @xmath222 leads to an identical equation if also lengths are rescaled according to @xmath223 .",
    "this leaves the prefactor in ( [ hmin_res ] ) invariant , but adds an arbitrary constant @xmath224 to @xmath19 .",
    "this is illustrated by comparing to a numerical simulation of the mean curvature equation ( [ mc ] ) close to the point of breakup , see fig .",
    "[ hminfig ] .",
    "namely , we subtract the analytical result ( [ hmin_res ] ) from the numerical solution @xmath225 and multiply by @xmath226 . as seen in fig.[hminfig ] , the remainder is varying slowly over 12 decades in @xmath32 .",
    "if the constant @xmath224 is adjusted , this small variation is seen to be consistent with the logarithmic dependence predicted by ( [ hmin_res ] ) .",
    "the second important point is that convergence in space is no longer uniform as implied by ( [ conv1 ] ) for the case of type i self - similarity .",
    "namely , to leading order the pinching solution is a cylinder . for this to be a good approximation",
    ", one has to require that the correction is small : @xmath227 .",
    "thus corrections become important beyond @xmath228 , which , in view of the logarithmic growth of @xmath19 , implies convergence in a constant region _ in similarity variables only_. as shown in @xcite , the slow convergence toward the self - similar behaviour has important consequences for a comparison to experimental data .",
    "mean curvature flow is also an example of a broader class of problems called generically `` geometric evolution equations '' .",
    "these are evolution equations intended to gain topological insight by flowing geometrical objects ( such as metric or curvature ) towards easily recognisable objects such as constant or positive curvature manifolds .",
    "the most remarkable example is the so called ricci flow , introduced in @xcite , which is the essential tool in the recent proof of the geometrisation conjecture ( including poincar s conjecture as a consequence ) by grigori perelman .",
    "namely , poincar s conjecture states that every simply connected closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere . being homeomorphic means that both are topologically equivalent and can be transformed one into the other through continuous mappings .",
    "such mappings can be obtained from the flow associated to an evolutionary pde involving fundamental geometrical properties of the manifold .",
    "thurston s geometrisation conjecture is a generalisation of poincar s conjecture to general 3-manifolds and states that compact 3-manifolds can be decomposed into submanifolds that have basic geometric structures .",
    "perelman sketched a proof of the full geometrisation conjecture in 2003 using ricci flow with surgery @xcite . starting with an initial 3-manifold ,",
    "one deforms it in time according to the solutions of the ricci flow pde ( [ ricci_g ] ) we consider below .",
    "since the flow is continuous , the different manifolds obtained during the evolution will be homeomorphic to the initial one .",
    "the problem is in the fact that ricci flow develops singularities in finite time , one of which we describe below .",
    "one would like to get over this difficulty by devising a mechanism of continuation of solutions beyond the singularity , making sure that such a mechanism controls the topological changes leading to a decomposition into submanifolds , whose structure is given by thurston s geometrisation conjecture .",
    "perelman obtained essential information on how singularities are like , essentially three dimensional cylinders made out of spheres stretched out along a line , so that he could develop the correct continuation ( also called `` surgery '' ) procedure and continue the flow up to a final stage consisting of the elementary geometrical objects in thurston s conjecture .",
    "ricci flow is defined by the equation @xmath229 for a riemannian metric @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is the ricci curvature tensor .",
    "the ricci tensor involves second derivatives of the curvature and terms that are quadratic in the curvature .",
    "hence , there is the potential for singularity formation and singularities are , in fact , formed .",
    "as perelman poses it , the most natural way to form a singularity in finite time is by pinching an almost round cylindrical neck .",
    "the structure of this kind of singularity has been studied in @xcite . by writing the metric of a @xmath232-dimensional cylinder as @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the canonical metric of radius one in the @xmath235sphere @xmath236",
    ", @xmath237 is the radius of the hypersurface @xmath238 at time @xmath171 and @xmath147 is the arclength parameter of the generatrix of the cylinder .",
    "the equation for @xmath36 then becomes @xmath239 in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath240 the solution close to the singularity admits a representation that resembles the one obtained for mean curvature flow : @xmath241 namely , ( [ ricci ] ) admits a constant solution @xmath242 , and the linearisation around it gives the same linear operator ( [ ling ] ) as for mean curvature flow .",

    "the semilinear parabolic equation @xmath247 is again closely related to the mean curvature flow problem ( [ mc ] ) .",
    "namely , disregarding the higher order term in @xmath248 , ( [ mc ] ) becomes @xmath249 putting @xmath250 one finds @xmath251 which is ( [ semilinear ] ) in one space dimension and @xmath252 , once more neglecting higher - order non - linearities . as before , ( [ semilinear ] ) has the exact blow - up solution @xmath253    if @xmath254 , where @xmath255 is the space dimension , then there are no other self - similar solutions to ( [ semilinear ] ) @xcite , and blow - up is of the form ( [ semi_blow ] ) ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a recent review ) . as in the case of mean curvature flow , corrections to ( [ semi_blow ] )",

    "one has to replace @xmath6 by the distance to the blow - up set .",
    "this covers all range of exponents ( larger than one , because otherwise there is no blow - up ) in dimensions @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "the situation if @xmath260 is not so clear : if @xmath261 then there are solutions that blow - up and `` small '' solutions that do not blow - up .",
    "nevertheless , the construction of solutions as perturbations of constant self - similar solutions holds for any @xmath255 and any @xmath262 . a simple generalisation of ( [ semilinear ] ) results from considering a nonlinear diffusion operator , @xmath263 and now the blow - up character depends on the two parameters m and p , see @xcite .",
    "more complex logarithmic corrections are possible if the linearisation around the fixed point leads to a zero eigenvalue and cubic nonlinearities .      as shown in @xcite , the equation for a slender cavity or bubble is @xmath264 where @xmath265 and @xmath1 is the radius of the bubble .",
    "dots denote derivatives with respect to time @xmath171 .",
    "the length @xmath266 measures the total size of the bubble .",
    "if for the moment one disregards boundary conditions and looks for solutions to ( [ bernoulli ] ) of cylindrical form , @xmath267 , one can do the integral to find @xmath268 it is easy to show that an an asymptotic solution of ( [ cyl ] ) is given by @xmath269 corresponding to a power law with a small logarithmic correction .",
    "indeed , initial theories of bubble pinch - off @xcite treated the case of an approximately cylindrical cavity , which leads to the radial exponent @xmath270 , with logarithmic corrections .",

    "thus , a second equation is needed to close the system , which is obtained by evaluating the the second derivative of ( [ bernoulli ] ) at the pinch point : @xmath278    the two coupled equations ( [ a0]),([deltaequ ] ) are most easily recast in terms of the time - dependent exponents @xmath279 where @xmath280 , so @xmath10 are generalisations of the usual exponents in ( [ ss ] ) .",

    "we now propose another system , which shares some of the structure of ( [ cosm : a])-([cosm : e ] ) , but which we are able to solve analytically : @xmath398 the system ( [ f : a])-([f : c ] ) is driven by the simplest type of blow - up equation ( [ f : c ] ) , and can be solved using characteristics .",
    "however , in the spirit of this review , we transform to similarity variables according to : @xmath399 it is seen directly from ( [ f : c ] ) that @xmath400 first blows up at a local maximum @xmath401 . near a maximum ,",
    "the horizontal scale is the square root of the vertical scale @xmath32 , and thus we must have @xmath402 . with that ,",
    "the similarity equations become @xmath403    the fixed point solution of the last equation is @xmath404 where @xmath405 is a constant . the equations for @xmath406",
    "are solved by the ansatz @xmath407 and for the function @xmath408 one finds @xmath409 with solution @xmath410 .",
    "thus ( a single component of ) the singular solution is indeed of the general form @xmath411 where @xmath412 is _ periodic _ in @xmath413 .",
    "this is a particularly simple version of discretely self - similar behaviour , i.e. when @xmath37 is the period of @xmath36 , the same self - similar picture is obtained for @xmath414 .",
    "in connection to limit cycles and in the context of singularities in relativity , a few interesting situations have been found numerically quite recently .",
    "one of them is the existence of hopf bifurcations where a self - similar solution ( a stable fixed point ) is transformed into a discrete self - similar solution ( limit cycle ) as a certain parameter varies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other kinds of bifurcations , for example of the shilnikov type , are found as well @xcite . before coming to simple explicit examples",
    ", we mention that possible complex dynamics in @xmath19 has long been suggested for simplified versions of the inviscid euler equations @xcite . for a critical discussion of this work , see @xcite .",
    "the problems considered in these papers were the 2d axisymmetric euler equations with swirl , which produces a centripetal force . in the limit",
    "that the rotation is confined to a small annulus , the direction of acceleration is locally uniform , and the equation reduces to that of 2d boussinesq convection , where the centripetal force is replaced by a `` gravity '' force .",
    "another related model is 2d porous medium convection , for which the equation reads @xmath415 where @xmath416 plays the role of the velocity field and @xmath37 is the temperature .",
    "the potential @xmath417 follows from the constraint of incompressibility , which gives @xmath418 .",
    "simulations provide evidence of a self - similar dynamics of the form @xcite @xmath419 where @xmath370 is approximately 0.1 and @xmath420 is a function that is slowly varying with @xmath19 .    depending on the model , both periodic behaviour as well as more complicated",
    ", chaotic motion has been observed in numerical simulations .",
    "oscillations of temperature in @xmath19 are motivated by the observation that a sharp , curved interface ( i.e. the transition region between a rising `` bubble '' of hot fluid and its surroundings ) becomes unstable and rolls up . however , owing to incompressibility , the sheet is also stretched , which stabilises the interface , leading to an eventual decrease in gradients .",
    "locality suggests that this process could repeat itself periodically on smaller and smaller scales @xcite .",
    "however , simulations of the euler equation have also shown examples of a more complicated dependence on @xmath19 , which might be chaotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "we also mention that corresponding chaotic behaviour has been proposed for the description of spin glasses in the theory of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "we now give some explicit examples of chaos in the description of a singularity .    in section [ quad ]",
    "we treated a system of an infinite number of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients of the expansion of an arbitrary perturbation to an explicit solution .",
    "such high - dimensional systems in principle allow for a rich variety of dynamical behaviours , including those found in classical finite dimensional dynamical systems , such as chaos .",
    "consider for instance an equation for the perturbation @xmath179 ( the analogue of ( [ gequ ] ) ) of the form @xmath421 where @xmath422 is a linear operator .",
    "assuming an appropriate non - linear structure for the function @xmath423 , an arbitrary nonlinear ( chaotic ) dynamics can be added .    to give an explicit example of a system of pde s exhibiting chaotic dynamics , consider the structure of the example given in section [ limit ] .",
    "it can be generalised to produce _ any _ low - dimensional dynamics near the singularity , as follows by considering the system ( [ f : a])-([f : c ] ) @xmath424 using the ansatz analogous to ( [ ansatz_circ ] ) : @xmath425 and choosing @xmath410 , one obtains the system @xmath426    to be specific , we consider @xmath427 and @xmath428 so that ( [ res_lor ] ) becomes the lorenz system @xcite . as before , for @xmath429 , the variable @xmath19 goes to infinity , and near the singularity one is exploring the long - time behaviour of the dynamical system ( [ ansatz_lor ] ) . in the case of ( [ sys_l ] ) , and for sufficiently large @xmath430 , the resulting dynamics will be chaotic . specifically ,",
    "taking @xmath431 , @xmath432 , and @xmath433 , as done by lorenz @xcite , the maximal lyapunov exponent is @xmath434 . the initial conditions with which ( [ ansatz_lor ] ) is to be solved depend on @xmath12 .",
    "thus the chaotic dynamics will follow a completely different trajectory for each space point . as a result",
    ", it will be very difficult to detect self - similar behaviour of this type as such , even if data arbitrarily close to the singularity time is taken .",
    "if for example a rescaled spatial picture is observed at constant intervals of logarithmic time @xmath19 , the spatial structure of the singularity will appear to be very different .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , chaotic motion is characterised by unstable periodic orbits , for which one could search numerically .",
    "the singularities described so far occur at a single point @xmath112 at a given time @xmath435 .",
    "this need not be the case , but blow - up may instead occur on sets of varying complexity , including sets of finite measure .",
    "we begin with a case where singularity formation involves two different points in space .",
    "a particularly rich singularity structure is found for a special case of ( [ thin_film ] ) in one space dimension with @xmath436 .",
    "dropping the second term on the right , which will typically be small , one arrives at @xmath437 this is a simplified model for a neck of liquid of width @xmath5 confined between two parallel plates , a so - called hele - shaw cell . which is a simplified model for the free surface in a so - called hele - shaw cell @xcite .",
    "breakup of a fluid neck inside the cell corresponds to @xmath5 going to zero in finite time .",
    "singular solutions displaying type - i self - similarity would be of the form @xmath438 but are never observed . instead , several types of pinch solutions different from ( [ hs_ss ] ) have been found for ( [ hs ] ) using a combination of numerics and asymptotic arguments @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "singularities exhibit type - ii self - similarity . on the other hand , the simple structure ( [ hs_ss ] )",
    "is broken by the fact that the location of the pinch point is _ moving _ in space .",
    "the root for this behaviour lies in the fact that two singularities are _ interacting _ over a distance much larger than their own spatial extend .",
    "below we report on three different kinds of singularities whose existence has been confirmed by numerical simulation of ( [ hs ] ) .    the first kind of singularity was called the _ imploding singularity _ in @xcite , since it consists of two self - similar solutions which form mirror images , and which collide at the singular time .",
    "locally , the solution can be written @xmath439 where @xmath440 is the constant speed of the singular point .",
    "note that the scaling exponents do not agree with ( [ hs_ss ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the singularity is moving , so @xmath5 is the solution of @xmath441 where @xmath442 is determined by matching to an outer region .",
    "the similarity profile @xmath82 is a solution of the equation @xmath443 , with boundary conditions @xmath444    ) with spatially periodic boundary conditions and initial condition ( [ hs_init ] ) , with @xmath445 and @xmath446 .",
    "[ hs_simulation ] ]    one might wonder whether this behaviour is generic , in the sense that it might depend on the initial conditions being exactly symmetric around the eventual point of blow up .",
    "the simulation of ( [ hs ] ) shown in fig .  [ hs_simulation ] shows that this is _ not _ the case .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath447 , \\label{hs_init}\\ ] ] which for @xmath282 reduces to the symmetric initial condition considered by @xcite .",
    "the type of singularity that is observed ( or no singularity at all ) depends on the parameter @xmath448 .",
    "the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ hs_simulation ] shows that even at finite @xmath125 ( non - symmetric initial conditions ) the final collapse is described by a symmetric solution .    , but both parameters @xmath449 and @xmath450 .",
    "[ hs_simulation2 ] ]    the second kind is the _ exploding singularity _",
    "@xcite , since now the two self - similar solutions are moving apart , cf .",
    "fig.[hs_simulation2 ] .",
    "this time even a very small asymmetry ( @xmath451 ) makes one pinching event `` win '' over the other .",
    "however , this does not affect the asymptotics described briefly below .",
    "locally , the solution can be written @xmath452 with @xmath453 , which is similar to examples considered in section [ sec : centre ] . however , an additional complication consists in the fact that the singularity is moving , so there is a coupling to the parabolic region between the two pinch - points .",
    "this matching is unaffected by the fact that in the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ hs_simulation2 ] one side of the solution touches down first . in @xcite , a possible generalisation is also conjectured , which has the form @xmath454 and @xmath455 . in principle",
    ", any value of @xmath456 is possible , but numerical evidence has been found for @xmath457 ( above ) and @xmath458 only .    finally , a third type is the _ symmetric singularity _ of @xcite , which does not move . in that case , the structure of the solution is @xmath459 with @xmath460 , where @xmath25 is a polynomial .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath125 is not reported .",
    "evidently , many aspects of the exploding and of the symmetric singularity remain to be confirmed and/or to be worked out in more detail .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the hele - shaw equation ( [ hs ] ) is that several types of _ stable _ singularities have been observed for the same equation . within a one - parameter family of smooth initial conditions ,",
    "all three types of singularities can be realized as @xmath461 .",
    "each type is observed over an interval of the parameter @xmath448 . near the boundary of the intervals ,",
    "a very interesting crossover phenomenon occurs : the solution is seen to follow one type of singularity at first ( the exploding singularity , say ) , and then crosses over to a solution of another singularity ( the imploding singularity ) .",
    "the dynamics of each singularity can be followed numerically over many decades in @xmath32 . by tuning @xmath448",
    ", the crossover can be made to occur at arbitrarily small values of @xmath5 .",
    "the switch in behaviour is driven by the slow dynamics of scaling regions exterior to ( [ hs_imp ] ) or ( [ hs_exp ] ) .",
    "it is a signature of the very long - ranged interactions ( both in real space as well as in scale ) , that exist in ( [ hs ] ) .",
    "thus an outside development can trigger a change of behaviour that is taking place on the local scale of the singularity . to mention another example , applying different boundary conditions for the pressure at the outside of the cell can change the singular behaviour completely @xcite .",
    "this makes the crossover behaviour of ( [ hs ] ) very different from that observed for drop pinch - off ( cf .",
    "( [ hequ]),([vequ ] ) ) , which is driven by a change in the dominant balance between different terms in ( [ vequ ] ) .",
    "it appears that the hele - shaw equation is not an isolated example , but rather is representative of a more general phenomenon .",
    "namely , another example of a potentially complex singularity structure is the semilinear wave equation @xmath462 it has trivial singular solutions of the form @xmath463 with @xmath464 ^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}$ ] .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of different self - similar solutions is known in a few particular cases , like the case @xmath465 , where @xmath466 is an odd integer ( see @xcite ) or in space dimension @xmath315 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the character of the blow - up is controlled by the blow - up curve @xmath467 , which is the locus where the equation first blows up at a given point in space .",
    "it has been shown for @xmath315 @xcite that there exists a set of _ characteristic _ points , where the blow - up curve locally coincides with the characteristics of ( [ semi - wave ] ) .",
    "the set of non - characteristic points @xmath468 is open , and @xmath37 is @xmath469 on @xmath468 .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that the blow - up at characteristic points is of type ii .",
    "even more intriguingly , it appears @xcite that the structure of blow - up at these points is such that the singularity results from the _ collision _ of two peaks at the blow - up point , very similar to the observation shown in fig .",
    "[ hs_simulation ] .      in the hele - shaw equation of the previous subsection , different parts of the solution , characterised by different scaling laws , interacted with each other . in the generic case , however , finally blow - up only occurred at a single point in space .",
    "an example where singularities may even occur on sets of finite measure is given by reaction - diffusion equations of the family @xmath470 where @xmath471 is any bounded , open set in dimension @xmath255 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath262 and @xmath472 singularities of ( [ react - diff ] ) may be regional ( @xmath303 blows up in subsets of @xmath473 of finite measure ) , or even global ( the solution blows - up in the whole domain ) ; see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "singularities may even happen in sets of fractional hausdorff dimension , i.e. , fractals .",
    "this is the case of the inviscid one - dimensional system for jet breakup ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and might be case of the navier - stokes system in three dimensions , where the dimension of the singular set at the time of first blow - up is at most @xmath258 ( cf .",
    "this connects to the second issue we did not address here .",
    "it is the nature of the singular sets both in space and time , i.e. including possible continuation of solutions after the singularity . in some instances ,",
    "existence of global in time ( for all @xmath474 ) solutions to nonlinear problems can be established in a _",
    "weak sense_. for example , this has been achieved for systems like the navier stokes equations @xcite , reaction - diffusion equations @xcite , and hyperbolic systems of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "weak solutions allow for singularities to develop both in space and time . in the case of the three - dimensional navier - stokes system ,",
    "the impossibility of singularities `` moving '' in time , that is of curves @xmath475 within the singular set is well - known @xcite .",
    "hence , provided certain kinds of singularities do not persist in time , the question is how to continue the solutions after a singularity has developed .",
