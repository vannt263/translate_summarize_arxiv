    "_ chimera states _ are intriguing spatio - temporal patterns made up of spatially separated domains of synchronized ( spatially coherent ) and desynchronized ( spatially incoherent ) behavior , although they arise in networks of completely identical units .",
    "kuramoto et al .",
    "discovered the chimeras in a network of phase oscillators with a simple symmetric non - local coupling scheme @xcite . within these `` classical '' chimera states , coherent domains of periodic in - phase oscillations",
    "coexist with incoherent domains , characterized by a chaotic behavior in time . in greek mythology ,",
    "the chimera is a fabulous creature with a lion s , a goat s , and a snake s head . as the counter intuitive dynamical state",
    "is as well composed of incongruous parts , it was named after the beast @xcite .",
    "kuramoto s finding initiated a broad wave of theoretical and empirical investigations @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence on chimera states was presented only one decade after their theoretical discovery @xcite . in real - world systems chimera states",
    "might play a role , e.g. , in the unihemispheric sleep of birds and dolphins  @xcite , in epileptic seizures  @xcite , in power grids  @xcite , or in social systems  @xcite .",
    "the basin of attraction of the chimera states is typically relatively small compared to that of the synchronized state .",
    "this explains why they were not detected for a long time .",
    "further , it is the reason why for many investigations specially prepared initial conditions are used .",
    "an interesting feature of the chimera states is that they are often long living transients towards the in - phase synchronized oscillatory state . by this , the coupling between the oscillators introduces a time scale much larger than the oscillation periods of each single oscillator .",
    "it was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally confirmed @xcite that the lifetime of the chimera states of phase oscillators grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "this illustrates impressively that they are not simply a temporary trace of the initial conditions , but are a persisting phenomenon .",
    "recently , the investigation of chimera states has been generalized towards networks of elements which have more complicated local dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , nodes which not only involve phase but also amplitude dynamics are considered . as described in @xcite , in such systems amplitude - mediated chimeras can be found , which show a chimera behavior with respect to the phases as well as with respect to the amplitudes . in this work",
    ", we will consider a different type of chimera states .",
    "they are characterized by strictly correlated phase dynamics throughout the whole network , but coexisting domains of coherent and incoherent amplitude dynamics .",
    "these _ amplitude chimeras _ were first described in @xcite . a crucial difference to classical phase chimeras is that the spatial incoherence does not imply chaotic behavior in time .",
    "in fact , all nodes of an amplitude chimera perform periodic oscillations , but in the incoherent domain the spatial sequence of the positions of the centers of oscillation is completely random .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that amplitude chimeras are long living transients , however , the dependence of their lifetimes upon the system size is not known .",
    "this will be one of the questions addressed in this work .",
    "+ it has been shown that the occurrence of the amplitude chimeras in a network of stuart - landau oscillator is restricted to the case of non - local coupling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the breaking of the rotational @xmath0 symmetry of the single oscillator is crucial . in this work , this symmetry breaking is realized through a coupling term which only involves the real parts instead of the complex variable @xmath1 , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "+ this symmetry - breaking coupling introduces a nontrivial spatially inhomogeneous fixed point ( steady state ) into the system @xcite , which is typically associated with a pitchfork bifurcation . as a result , oscillation death patterns occur in addition to the oscillatory states .",
    "_ oscillation death _ is a phenomenon appearing in oscillator networks , when the coupling induces a splitting of a ( trivial ) homogeneous fixed point into at least two distinct branches @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with amplitude death , where the quenching of the oscillations is caused by stabilization of an unstable spatially homogeneous fixed point which is already present in the uncoupled case @xcite .",
    "when the newly born inhomogeneous fixed point is stabilized , typically through an inverse hopf bifurcation , the oscillatory dynamics can be suppressed . in general , however , oscillation death states can coexist with oscillatory solutions .",
    "amplitude chimeras and oscillation death are two different phenomena related to symmetry breaking that occur in the stuart - landau oscillator network .",
    "interestingly , a novel type of steady state coherence - incoherence patterns combining features of both phenomena , called _ chimera death _ , has been discovered in this system @xcite . like amplitude chimeras ,",
    "these patterns are characterized by coexisting domains of coherent and incoherent behavior in space .",
    "they have recently been extended to globally coupled networks @xcite .",
    "+ an important question is whether transient chimera patterns persist under perturbations .",
    "the robustness of classical phase chimeras with respect to heterogeneous natural frequencies of the oscillators @xcite or heterogeneous connections @xcite was investigated .",
    "it was found that the specific way in which links are removed from the network defines how strongly the chimera lifetimes are affected .",
    "also in the fitzhugh - nagumo model , the robustness of chimeras with respect to heterogeneous frequencies and topologies was studied @xcite .",
    "apart from the present work , the robustness of chimera states with respect to external noise has so far not been considered .",
    "this problem is especially relevant in the light of experimental realizations where noise is inevitable .",
    "it is known that even at a relatively low intensity , noise can significantly influence the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system . under certain conditions noise",
    "can cause the increase of coherence , e.g. , in coherence resonance , and on the contrary it can also induce irregular , chaotic dynamics .",
    "stochasticity appears due to the intrinsic fluctuations in a system , or alternatively can be implemented as an external random control force .",
    "the influence of noise strongly depends on its characteristics such as intensity , for example , which can be treated as bifurcation parameters of a stochastic system .",
    "therefore , the investigation of noisy dynamics is on the one hand significant for the understanding of the processes occurring in nature and on the other hand relevant from the point of view of control .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate how external noise influences the occurrence of chimera death states and amplitude chimeras , and how it affects their properties and lifetimes . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce novel order parameters to characterize chimera states , and discuss the impact of initial conditions . in order to explain our numerical findings",
    ", we propose that amplitude chimeras represent a saddle - state in the underlying phase space . + the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we introduce the model . in sect .",
    "iii we analyze amplitude chimeras and chimera death without noise and introduce a global measure which can distinguish between chimera patterns and completely coherent dynamics like in - phase synchronization or traveling waves and can be used to quantify the lifetime of chimeras .",
    "further , we focus on the role of the initial conditions and the dependence of the chimeras upon coupling parameters and system size . in sect . iv the influence of noise upon the transient times of chimeras is investigated .",
    "v summarizes the results in terms of the different regimes of the coupling parameters , and sect .",
    "vi draws conclusions .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath2 stuart - landau oscillators @xcite under the impact of external white noise @xmath3 .",
    "the local deterministic dynamics of each node @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 , with the normal form of a supercritical hopf bifurcation @xmath6 where @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . at @xmath10",
    "a hopf bifurcation occurs , so that for @xmath11 the single stuart - landau oscillator exhibits self - sustained oscillations with frequency @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 , and the unique fixed point @xmath14 , @xmath15 is unstable .",
    "+ we investigate a ring of @xmath2 non - locally coupled stuart - landau oscillators , where each node is coupled to its @xmath16 nearest neighbors in both directions with the strength @xmath17 , and is subject to noise of intensity @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and all indices are modulo @xmath2 . the coupling and the noise are only applied to the real parts .",
    "in many real - world oscillator systems only one variable is accessible for coupling .",
    "for instance , the diffusive coupling through only one variable naturally arises in biological and biochemical systems .",
    "the simplest coupling scheme is hence to choose the real parts of the complex variable @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath21 is additive gaussian white noise @xcite , i.e. , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the kronecker - delta and @xmath25 denotes the delta - distribution . hence the noise is spatially uncorrelated .",
    "as shown in @xcite in the absence of noise , various different states can be found in the network given by eq.([eq : sl_network_det ] ) . which particular state actually arises , depends on the specific values of the coupling parameters and the initial conditions , as eq.([eq : sl_network_det ] ) describes a multistable system . among the possible states ,",
    "two different types of asymptotically stable states can be found , on the one hand oscillatory states , and on the other hand steady state patterns which are related to oscillation death .",
    "the latter are represented by completely coherent or completely incoherent oscillation death patterns , as well as by chimera death patterns .",
    "the asymptotically stable oscillatory states appear in two different spatio - temporal patterns : in - phase synchronized oscillations and coherent traveling waves . besides these , long lasting oscillatory transients with interesting features occur , i.e. , amplitude chimera states . in this work",

    "in contrast to classical chimeras , during the chimera all nodes ( including the ones within the incoherent domains ) oscillate with the same approximate period , @xmath34 , and a spatially correlated phase , but they show spatially incoherent behavior with respect to the _ amplitudes _ in part of the system . figure [ fig : ac - example ] shows an exemplary amplitude chimera configuration .",

    "such a phase space scenario explains the sensitivity of transient times to initial conditions since they determine the particular path the system takes . with increasing network size @xmath2 , the dimension of the phase space of the network increases , and it becomes more likely that the distance of the initial conditions to the stable manifold is larger , which leads to decreasing transient times for passing the saddle - point .",
