    "the particle data book abounds with hadronic resonances @xcite . however , there are comparatively few states which are very close to the threshold for decay into other mesons .",
    "recently a new near - threshold state  the narrow @xmath1 ( @xmath7 and possibly @xmath8 ) at about @xmath9 below @xmath10 threshold  was found at babar @xcite , cleo @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "note , that the @xmath1 state can be interpreted in a number of ways : ( a ) as the missing triplet s - wave @xmath11 @xmath12 `` quarkonium state '' ; ( b ) as a `` single bag '' @xmath13 of two separate hadrons .",
    "the two hadrons in the last case can be bound  just like the deuteron  by an attractive potential due to the t - channel exchange of various light mesons .",
    "the lagrangian has `` off - diagonal '' terms such as @xmath14 pair creation and annihilation and/or `` bag '' fissioning and rejoining interconnecting states of type ( a ) and ( b ) , and ( b ) and ( c ) respectively . as a result",
    "we expect that @xmath1 is a superposition of all three states in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the question is then which one dominates the state @xmath15 .",
    "regardless of how one chooses to interpret the state there is one key fact about this state which will play a major role in what follows : the state is extremely close to the @xmath10 threshold .",
    "this situation parallels a case of the pseudoscalar isosinglet and isotriplet mesons@xmath3 and @xmath5which are very close to the @xmath16 threshold .",
    "these states can correspond to any one of the three cases above provided the quark pair @xmath17 is replaced by @xmath18 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite one of us argued in favor of interpretations ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the argument in @xcite was based on the fact that the mass difference of approximately @xmath19 between @xmath1 and the state @xmath20 @xmath11 with a mass of about @xmath21 ( belle @xcite ) is significantly smaller than an approximate @xmath22 split between any two `` strangeness analogue '' @xmath23 ) mesonic or baryonic state @xcite .",
    "likewise , the isotriplet ( @xmath24-wave ) @xmath18 state is @xmath9 lighter than the isotriplet @xmath25-wave @xmath26 rather than being more than @xmath27 heavier , as is the case for all other nonets .",
    "this is an argument against the `` minimal '' interpretation of @xmath3 and @xmath5 states as @xmath18 pairs .",
    "to the extent that @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 are indeed of type ( b ) or ( c ) then the following prediction can be made .",
    "a `` qcd inequality '' @xcite implies yet another pseudoscalar @xmath28 state approximately @xmath22 below the threshold @xcite .",
    "this state can be discovered via the @xmath29 decay mode in babar and belle .",
    "ordinary @xmath30 states are accounted for and such a state would have to be interpreted as being exotic .",
    "of course , one can take a far more agnostic position as far as the interpretation of the @xmath1 or the @xmath3 and @xmath5 . since the three interpretations were expressed in terms of model concepts rather than qcd degrees of freedom",
    ", one can argue that even in principle there is no way to distinguish between them .",
    "however one chooses to interpret these states , we can rely on the fact that they have @xmath8 and are only very slightly below the corresponding break - up thresholds : @xmath31 below @xmath10 and @xmath32 below @xmath16 thresholds respectively .",
    "this fact greatly facilitates the possibility that these mesons will be bound weakly into `` molecular''-like states : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "while any of these states would be interesting to observe , the @xmath38 is of particular interest owing to the fact that by quantum numbers alone ( @xmath39 ) it is manifestly exotic .",
    "bound state : @xmath40-channel @xmath2 exchange.,height=188 ]     bound state : @xmath40-channel @xmath2 exchange.,height=188 ]     bound state : @xmath40-channel @xmath2 exchange.,height=188 ]",
    "the key to our analysis is the following fact .",
    "if there exists a meson @xmath41 quite near to the break - up threshold into a @xmath2 plus another meson , @xmath42 , then there will be an unnaturally long - ranged force between mesons @xmath41 and @xmath42 due to @xmath2 exchange .",
    "now suppose the @xmath2-exchange force leads to an attractive @xmath25-wave interaction .",
    "this in turn will lead to tendency toward binding .",
    "of course , if the state formed is deeply bound , then the fact the interaction is comparatively long ranged plays no important role . indeed ,",
    "if the state is deeply bound , the @xmath2-exchange mechanism clearly does not dominate and one would need to understand the physics at the quark level .",
    "however , if the state formed is relatively loosely bound , the unnaturally long - ranged character of the potential becomes essential to the binding . as we show below , for a large range of parameters , this is precisely what occurs : the @xmath2-exchange is strong enough to bind the two mesons together but is weak enough so that the resulting bound state is dominated by ranges where the @xmath2-exchange is expected to be important .",
    "note , that if we are in such a weakly bound region , it is legitimate to use a nonrelativistic schrdinger equation to describe the dynamics .",
    "we begin the analysis by deriving the interaction due to the @xmath2-exchange .",
    "consider two `` heavy '' mesons @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ( @xmath46)case ( 1)or @xmath1case ( 2 ) ; @xmath47 ( @xmath4)case ( 1)or @xmath0case ( 2 ) ) of the same spin and opposite parity .",
    "the mesons need only be heavy in the sense that their masses are much larger than the ultimate binding energy between them . in this regime",
    ", the binding potential , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , can be obtained from a one - kaon exchange amplitude shown in the feynman diagrams of figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] .",
    "they can be evaluated in the limit in which the recoil energies of the mesons @xmath43 and @xmath50 are neglected ( such a limit is justified near the @xmath51 threshold ) . in this limit",
    "the energy transfer carried by an off - shell @xmath2 meson is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the masses of @xmath43 , @xmath50 and @xmath2 mesons respectively . in the cases of interest here",
    "this energy is @xmath54 , _",
    "i.e. _ much smaller than the mass of @xmath2 meson .",
    "the @xmath55 can be viewed as the binding energy of @xmath2 and @xmath42 into @xmath41 .    keeping the leading term in @xmath6 expansion of the kaon propagator and taking the fourier transform of the amplitude one obtains an attractive yukawa - like potential : @xmath56\\over r } = \\alpha_i \\,\\ , { { \\rm exp}\\left [ -\\kappa_i \\ , r\\right]\\over r}\\ , , \\label{v}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) is ( the mass dimension two ) coupling constant of the @xmath25-wave yukawa coupling @xmath60 .",
    "the factor @xmath61 in the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) comes from the non - relativistic normalization of the scalar wave functions of @xmath43 and @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , the coupling constant @xmath62 is dimensionless .    the potential in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) can be interpreted as the ( asymptomatic ) profile function of the field strength of the virtual @xmath2 inside the @xmath63 bound state ( up to the coupling constants ) .",
    "it has the form of an outgoing spherical wave with a purely imaginary momentum @xmath64 with @xmath65 equal to @xmath66 .",
    "note that the @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) replaces @xmath67 in the standard yukawa - like potential yielding much longer range potentials .",
    "this effect is huge for possible @xmath68 loosely state considered by t@xmath69rnqvist @xcite . as in our case , @xmath70 is tiny . however , in that case , the interaction is in @xmath24-wave with a derivative @xmath71 coupling . as a result ,",
    "the increase in the range in this case is essentially compensated by the corresponding decrease in the strength of the coupling .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath25-wave momentum independent couplings relevant in our case .",
    "the central result of this paper is that for a wide range of `` reasonable '' interactions between @xmath41 and @xmath42 binding results .    in the two cases considered here(1 )",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and ( 2 ) @xmath73the values of @xmath65 are : @xmath74 the variation in eq .",
    "( [ kappa12 ] ) is due to the differences in binding energies for various @xmath0 and @xmath2 charge sates .",
    "the binding energies of the @xmath75 `` molecules '' can now be determined from the schrdinger equation with a potential given in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) and reduced masses @xmath76 ( case ( 1 ) ) and @xmath77 ( case ( 2 ) ) .",
    "the binding energies and the typical sizes of the ground state wave functions ( given by @xmath78 ) for a number of couplings @xmath79 and values of @xmath65 ( eq .  ( [ kappa12 ] ) ) are shown in tables  [ tabl1 ] , [ tabl2],[tabl3 ] ( case ( 1 ) ) and tables  [ tabl4 ] , [ tabl5],[tabl6 ] ( case ( 2 ) ) @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of the coupling constant @xmath80 was determined to be @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless coupling is @xmath82 .",
    "we also assume that the same value is applicable in the case of @xmath83 and @xmath84 systems .    .@xmath85",
    "( @xmath86 ) : the binding energies and the size of the ground sate wave function for the potential in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) with @xmath87 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that as the composite states overlap the strong short range hyperfine interactions come into play since we have largely different quarks in @xmath1 and @xmath0 even for the case ( b ) above with @xmath1 viewed as a four - quark construct .",
    "the tendency to form these new loosely bound states would imply that at shorter distances we have even stronger attraction that the extrapolation of the relatively smooth yukawa potential to short distances and the results without any cutoff and a fortiori those in the case ( 2 ) may be relevant !",
    "it is interesting to note the drastic consequence of an even small attractive scattering length  with no bound state in @xmath88 ( rather than @xmath89 channel ) .",
    "arbitrary ( sufficiently large ) number of @xmath90 in a common @xmath25-wave sate would then attract forming a condensate carrying macroscopic strangeness _ ala _",
    "lee and yang or coleman s @xmath91-balls @xcite .",
    "the longest range interaction between two kaons ( and in fact any two mesons ! ) due to the two pion exchange  specifically the @xmath25-wave projection thereof in the @xmath40-channel is like a @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) or a scalar graviton exchange which is always attractive .",
    "the same also holds for @xmath94 interactions .",
    "however , the scattering length in the born approximation appropriate here is given by @xmath95 and the long range attraction is overcome ( surely for @xmath96 from scattering data analysis and most likely for @xmath97 ) by the strong short range repulsion so that the condensates may not exist .",
    "it is amusing to note in passing the ( admittedly weak ) connection between the @xmath98 bound state and the `` efimov effect '' @xcite .",
    "the latter ( which inspired us to look at the present problem ) would arise for a zero energy @xmath99 @xmath25-wave bound state and infinite scattering length .",
    "this in turn leads to an infinite series of three body @xmath100 bound states .",
    "the ratios the binding energies and the sizes of the efimov states scale as @xmath101 ( see also @xcite ) .clearly in the present case where the range of the actual potential is only about @xmath102 this idealized case and the very extended @xmath103 ( or contracted)states in the above series are irrelevant .",
    "note , the the yukawa potential , eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) goes to @xmath104 in the limit as @xmath105 goes to infinity and @xmath106 goes to zero rather rather then @xmath107 as in the efimov effect .",
    "the reason is that the efimov effect requires exact diagonalization of the degenerate perturbation transcending the perturbative one - meson exchange @xcite .",
    "assuming that the @xmath73 `` molecular '' state exists how can it be produced and detected ?",
    "since the production requires two pairs of @xmath108 quarks the discussion in @xcite is relevant , providing an upper bound on the expected rate of the new loosely bound extended @xmath73 state which we term @xmath109 for _",
    "molecular_.    the bound state should manifest as a narrow peak in the mass distribution of associate @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . however , the limited experimental resolution at babar and fermi lab experiments limits the extent that we can utilize this .",
    "the different binding of @xmath110 and @xmath111 and different life - time @xmath112 may lead to some extra signatures in specific charge dependence of the width and even in the binding energies .",
