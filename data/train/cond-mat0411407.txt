    "creating and manipulating a non - equilibrium magnetisation in a non - magnetic metal is a central requirement in the field of spintronics@xcite .",
    "the orientation of an electron spin injected in a non - magnetic metal is the result of the interaction of the spin intrinsic magnetic moment with the magnetic fields in which the spin is moving . in the presence of a uniform magnetic field , the spin precesses coherently around the field s direction and its orientation changes with a uniform precession frequency .    in a diffusive metal , a ( non - uniform )",
    "effective magnetic field arises from the relativistic motion of the spin in the electric field of the metal ions and the defects@xcite .",
    "this is called spin orbit interaction and it is responsible for the randomisation of the spin orientation : the relaxation of the non - equilibrium magnetisation occurs by transferring the spin angular momentum to the metal lattice in a time scale in the order of 100  ps .    to induce a spin current and a spin accumulation , a spin dependent scattering is required for the conduction electrons . the usual approach in all - electrical transport experiments is to drive a current from a ferromagnet ( fm ) whose band structure is spin dependent , to a non - magnetic ( n ) metal .",
    "it has been noted that the main obstacle for efficient spin injection in the diffusive regime is the short spin relaxation length in the ferromagnet , a problem known by the name of conductance mismatch@xcite . in gmr experiments@xcite , with vertical devices ,",
    "the useful signal can be made large enough for practical applications by reducing the distance between the ferromagnetic layers . in lateral structures , this is not a feasible solution , due to technological limitations .",
    "also , in the clean contact regime , measures have to be taken to ensure that either the current path is perpendicular to the fm / n interface or that the voltage probes are separate from the current path .",
    "anomalous magneto - resistance and hall effect can mimic and hide the spin accumulation@xcite .",
    "in order to overcome these problems , tunnel barriers were proposed@xcite at the interface between the ferromagnetic metal and the normal metal layer ( the tunnel barrier conductance being proportional to the fm density of states ) , thereby making the tunnel barrier the dominant ( spin dependent ) resistance of the system .",
    "previous experiments have studied the spin current in systems larger than the spin relaxation length .",
    "a seminal experiment was performed by johnson and silsbee@xcite in the clean contact regime and four - terminal configuration , in a device with two lateral dimensions larger than the spin relaxation length .",
    "the experiment was performed on single crystal aluminium bar .",
    "the long spin relaxation length they found , @xmath3 m at 4.2  k , allowed them to observe a weak ( tens of pv ) spin precession signal at macroscopic scale .",
    "in diffusive metallic systems , with typical relaxation lengths in the @xmath4 m range , observations were done by jedema _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite at room temperature in a one - dimensional device , both with clean contacts and with tunnel barriers at the fm / n interfaces in four - terminal devices .",
    "the spin signal in the clean case was about 1  m@xmath5 and about two orders of magnitude larger for the devices with tunnel barriers , proving their efficiency as spin injector / detector .",
    "spin accumulation occurs in two terminal pillar structures with all dimensions shorter than the spin relaxation length , used to study the magnetisation reversal of a thin fm layer , driven by a spin polarised current created by a second massive fm layer@xcite .",
    "the torque exerted on the fm layer is proportional to the spin accumulation , which is in the mv range .",
    "recently@xcite we have performed electrical injection and detection of spin accumulation in an aluminium island with all lateral dimensions shorter than the spin relaxation length @xmath6 ( @xmath7 m at rt ) , where @xmath8 is the diffusion constant and @xmath9 the spin relaxation time .",
    "tunnel barriers separated the island from the cobalt electrodes .",
    "as opposed to the previous four - terminal experiments , the spins in our case are confined to the island , and since the diffusion time @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the island s size ) is shorter than @xmath9 , the induced magnetisation behaves uniformly within the island , so that the spatial variation of the magnetisation can be disregarded and the system is zero - dimensional with respect to the spin .",
    "the description of coherent spin transport in a diffusive metal is obtained from the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "the two - channel ( spin up and spin down ) model of valet and fert@xcite , which successfully describes the experimental results of giant magneto - resistance , is however limited to the collinear ( magnetisation either parallel or anti - parallel ) case . in the general case , one has to retain all the information about the spin direction inside the bulk metal and at the fm / n interfaces .    a theoretical approach to systematically studying the transport through fm / n interfaces in the non - collinear situation",
    "was developed by brataas _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter , alongside the interface conductance for spin up and spin down electrons @xmath12 , is a ( complex valued ) mixing conductance term @xmath13 , describing the reflection of electron spins perpendicular to the magnetisation of the ferromagnet .",
    "@xmath14 is related to the amount of angular moment that the electron spin has transferred to the ferromagnet , and plays an important role in the description of the spin torque and spin pumping@xcite .    here",
    "we present a systematic study of non - collinear spin accumulation in a small metallic island , extending the results of ref .  .",
    "theoretically , we apply the circuit theory to the system and show how the presence of the fm contacts provides an additional ( and anisotropic ) mechanism for the relaxation of the spin accumulation , with the relaxation occurring at a faster rate in the direction perpendicular to the fm magnetisation axis .    in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , we derive a formula in the zero dimensional limit ( @xmath15 ) for the spin accumulation as a function of the contacts properties .",

    "[ results ] presents an extensive set of measurements of spin accumulation in a non - magnetic island at 4.2  k and at room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "we use spin precession as a tool to analyse the spin accumulation and extract the relevant parameters such as the spin relaxation time , and the direction of the magnetisation of the fm contacts .",
    "we also show that , for our device , the magnetisation relaxation is independent of the mixing conductance term .",
    "to completely characterise the electronic transport in the linear regime , including the spin , four chemical potentials are necessary , one spin independent ( charge ) and three spin dependent ( magnetisation ) .",
    "the main idea of the finite element theory of brataas _ _ et al.__@xcite , is to divide the system into ( normal or ferromagnetic ) _ nodes _ connected to each other or to reservoirs by _ contacts _ ( interfaces ) .",
    "a contact can be spin selective , that is it can have different conductances for the two spin populations .    in each node",
    ", spin accumulation appears as a result of the spin currents through the contacts . in turn , the amount of spin current through each contact is determined by its conductance and by the chemical potentials of the two nodes on each side of the contact .",
    "thus , the problem of the transport in the system is broken down into the solution of the motion of charge and magnetisation inside a node with the additional boundary conditions given by the charge and spin current through the contacts . the finite element theory of brataas _ et al .",
    "_ provides an elegant way to describe the charge and spin currents through fm / n interfaces .",
    "( 0 , 0 ) ( 0 , -80)@xmath16    in the following , we will briefly review the elements of the theory that are relevant for our experimental situation .",
    "we will then present an analytical solution for the situation in which the electron diffusion time inside the island @xmath17 can be neglected when compared to the spin relaxation time @xmath9 .",
    "this last assumption is equivalent to saying that the distribution of magnetisation is uniform in the island and we will therefore call it , a zero - dimensional system from here on .    in a fm / n device , and for arbitrary configuration of the magnetic reservoirs , a spin current injected from a fm reservoir to a node of normal metal will cause a non equilibrium accumulation of magnetisation . in the linear regime , we describe the transport properties by means of four chemical potentials @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spin independent and spin dependent chemical potentials in the node and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the spin independent and spin dependent distribution functions .",
    "@xmath23 represents the spin accumulation in different directions and @xmath24 its magnitude . in equilibrium ,",
    "no spin accumulation exists in normal and ferromagnetic nodes or reservoirs .    only in the particular case",
    "in which the spin accumulation has the same direction throughout the entire system ( and the contacts are all collinear ) , one can use a description in terms of two , spin up and spin down , chemical potentials : these are related to @xmath16 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in a reservoir",

    "the motion of charge and magnetisation in the island is diffusive as the mean free path is of the order of 5  nm at rt and 20  nm at 4.2  k.    the finite element theory specifies the charge and spin _ particle _ currents @xmath31 and @xmath32 through the contacts that connect the island .",
    "this is related to the amplitude probabilities @xmath33 for the reflection of a spin up electron from mode @xmath34 to mode @xmath35 in the normal metal , evaluated at the normal side of the contact .",
    "if , as in our case , the tunnel barrier is non - magnetic and @xmath36 is the unit vector representing the magnetisation direction of the @xmath37 electrode , the natural choice for the quantisation axis is collinear to @xmath36 ( and @xmath38 means , for instance , parallel to @xmath36 and @xmath39 anti - parallel ) . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the conductances for the up and down spin channels , @xmath42 is the total contacts conductance and @xmath43 the polarisation of the interface .    also the assumption that spin transport through the contacts can be specified only in terms of @xmath33 , @xmath33 implies that a spin up electron have zero probability of being converted into a spin down electron , that is no spin flips occur inside the contacts@xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that spin accumulation in the fm side can only be collinear to the magnetisation direction , i.e. the spin dependent chemical potential is of the form @xmath44 , as the large exchange field rapidly randomises the spin component perpendicular to @xmath45 .",

    "we now derive from the circuit theory some relationships relevant in the two cases : fm electrode as voltage probe and fm electrode as spin source .    when a fm electrode is used as a voltage probe , the spin independent chemical potential on the fm side is raised above the n chemical potential by an amount that depends on the spin accumulation on the two sides of the contact .",

    "the expression we derived for the spin accumulation in the island is valid in the case of negligible spin accumulation in the fm contacts .",
    "experimentally , we have fabricated a small island of aluminium with all dimensions ( 400  nm@xmath28400  nm@xmath2830  nm ) smaller than the spin relaxation length ( @xmath266  nm at rt ) .",
    "transparent tunnel barriers between the island and the fm electrodes provide a spin dependent resistance that is much higher than all the other ( spin independent ) resistances in the system , so as to overcome the conductivity mismatch .",
    "because of the lateral dimensions of the island compared to the spin flip length , only pure spin accumulation occurs in our device : the spin signal can therefore be described in terms of the relative orientations of the magnetic electrodes .",
    "spin valve and spin precession measurements were presented for different electrical configurations .",
    "the peculiarity in the experiments is that the ohmic drop across the island is smaller than the spin signal .    in spin valve and precession measurements ,",

    "the spin relaxation time at room temperature was found to be @xmath0  ps .",
    "the presence of tunnel barriers confine the electrons inside the island and they tunnel out of the system long after having lost their spin information : in fact the escape time is three orders of magnitude larger than the spin flip time . with our lateral devices , it is not possible to directly measure the spin mixing conductance .",
