    "one of the fundamental aims of mathematical population genetics is the construction of population models in order to describe and to analyse certain phenomena which are of interest for biological applications .",
    "usually these models are constructed such that they describe the evolution of the population under consideration forwards in time .",
    "a classical and widely used model of this kind is the wright - fisher diffusion , which can be used for large populations to approximate the evolution of the fraction of individuals carrying a particular allele . on the other hand",
    "it is often quite helpful to look from the present back into the past and to trace back the ancestry of a sample of @xmath3 individuals , genes or particles . in many situations ,",
    "the kingman coalescent @xcite turns out to be an appropriate tool to approximate the ancestry of a sample taken from a large population .",
    "it is well known that the wright - fisher diffusion is dual to the block counting process of the kingman coalescent @xcite .",
    "more general , the fleming - viot process @xcite , a measure - valued extension of the wright - fisher diffusion , is dual to the kingman coalescent .",
    "such and similar duality results are quite common in particular in the physics literature on interacting particle systems @xcite and in the more theoretical literature on mathematical population genetics @xcite .",
    "donnelly and kurtz @xcite established a so - called lookdown construction and used this construction to show that the fleming - viot process is dual to the kingman coalescent .",
    "this construction and corresponding duality results have been extended @xcite to the @xmath0-fleming - viot process , which is the measure - valued dual of a coalescent process allowing for multiple collisions of ancestral lineages . for more information on coalescent processes with multiple collisions , so - called @xmath0-coalescents",
    ", we refer to pitman @xcite and sagitov @xcite .",
    "there exists a broader class of coalescent processes @xcite in which many multiple collisions can occur with positive probability simultaneously at the same time .",
    "these processes can be characterized by a measure @xmath2 on an infinite simplex and are hence called @xmath2-coalescents .",
    "it is natural to further extend the above constructions and results to this full class of coalescent processes and , in particular , to provide constructions of the dual processes , called @xmath2-fleming - viot processes .",
    "although such extensions have been briefly indicated in @xcite and @xcite , these extensions have not been carried out in detail yet .",
    "@xmath2-coalescents have also recently been applied to study population genetic problems , see @xcite .",
    "the motivation to present this paper is hence manifold .",
    "we explicitly construct the @xmath2-fleming - viot process and provide a representation via empirical measures of an exchangeable particle system in the spirit of donnelly and kurtz @xcite .",
    "we furthermore establish corresponding convergence results and pathwise duality to the @xmath2-coalescent .",
    "we also provide an alternative , more classical functional - analytic construction of the @xmath2-fleming - viot process based on the hille - yosida theorem and present representations for the generator of the @xmath2-fleming - viot process .",
    "our approaches include neutral mutations .",
    "the results give insights into the pathwise structure of the @xmath2-fleming - viot process and its dual @xmath2-coalescent .",
    "examples and situations are presented in which certain @xmath2-fleming - viot processes and their dual @xmath2-coalescents occur naturally .",
    "consider a population of fixed size @xmath4 and assume that each individual is of a certain type , where the space @xmath5 of possible types is assumed to be compact and polish .",
    "furthermore assume that for each vector @xmath6 of integers satisfying @xmath7 and @xmath8 a non - negative real quantity @xmath9 is given .",
    "the population is assumed to evolve in continuous time as follows . given a vector @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with rate @xmath13 we choose randomly @xmath14 groups of sizes @xmath15 from the present population .",
    "inside each of these @xmath14 groups we furthermore choose randomly a ` parent ' which forces all individuals in its group to change their type to the type of that parent .",
    "we say that a @xmath16-reproduction event occurs with rate @xmath13 .",
    "the classical moran model corresponds to @xmath17 .    except for the fact that these models are formulated in continuous time ,",
    "they essentially coincide with the class of neutral exchangeable population models with non - overlapping generations introduced by cannings @xcite . starting with the seminal work of kingman @xcite , the genealogy of samples taken from such populations",
    "is well understood , in particular for the situation when the total population size @xmath18 tends to infinity .      for neutral population models of large , but fixed population size and finite - variance reproduction mechanism , kingman @xcite showed that the genealogy of a finite sample of size @xmath3 can be approximately described by the so called @xmath3-coalescent @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath3-coalescent is a time - homogeneous markov process taking values in @xmath20 , the set of partitions of @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are in the same block of the partition @xmath24 , then they have a common ancestor at time @xmath25 ago . @xmath26 is the partition of @xmath21 into singleton blocks .",
    "the transitions are then given as follows : if there are @xmath27 blocks at present , then each pair of blocks merges with rate 1 , thus the overall rate of seeing a merging event is @xmath28 .",
    "note that only binary mergers are allowed and that at some random time , all individuals will have a ( most recent ) common ancestor .",
    "kingman @xcite also showed that there exists a @xmath29-valued markov process @xmath30 , where @xmath29 denotes the set of partitions of @xmath31 .",
    "this process , the so - called kingman coalescent , is characterised by the fact that for each @xmath3 the restriction of @xmath30 to the first @xmath3 natural numbers is the @xmath3-coalescent",
    ". the process can be constructed by an application of the standard kolmogoroff extension theorem , since the restriction of every @xmath3-coalescent to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , is an @xmath14-coalescent .    whereas the kingman coalescent allows only for binary mergers , the idea of a time - homogeneous @xmath29-valued markov process that evolves by the coalescence of blocks",
    "was extended by pitman @xcite and sagitov @xcite to coalescents where multiple blocks are allowed to merge at the same time , so - called @xmath0-coalescents , which arise as the limiting genealogy of populations where the variance of the offspring distribution diverges as the population size tends to infinity .",
    "mhle and sagitov @xcite and schweinsberg @xcite introduced the even larger class of coalescents with simultaneous multiple collisions , also called exchangeable coalescents or @xmath2-coalescents , which describe the genealogies of populations allowing for large family sizes .",

    "exactly @xmath47 blocks collide into @xmath48 new blocks , each containing @xmath49 original blocks , and @xmath50 single blocks remain unchanged , such that the condition @xmath51 holds .",
    "the order of @xmath52 does not matter .",
    "the rate at which the above collision happens is then given as ( schweinsberg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) ) @xmath53 an intuitive explanation of ( [ rates ] ) is given below in terms of schweinsberg s @xcite poisson process construction of the @xmath2-coalescent .",

    "we provide explicit expressions for several quantities of interest .      consider a population , say with non - overlapping generations , in which the population size has undergone occasional abrupt changes in the past .",
    "specifically , we assume that ` typically ' , each generation contains @xmath18 individuals , but at several instances in the past , it has been substantially smaller for a certain amount of time , and then the population has quickly re - grown to its typical size @xmath18 .",
    "this is related to the models considered by jagers & sagitov in @xcite , but we assume occasional much more radical changes in population size than @xcite . let us assume that the demographic history is described by three sequences of positive real numbers @xmath728 , @xmath729 and @xmath730 , where @xmath731 holds for all @xmath22 , and the population size @xmath25 generations before the present is given by @xmath732 , where @xmath733 thus , back in time the population stays at size @xmath18 for some time @xmath734 .",

    "note that we assume @xmath747 as @xmath145 , so the duration of the bottleneck is negligible on the timescale of the ` normal ' genealogy .",
    "we also assume @xmath740 but @xmath748 , i.e. , in the pre - limiting scenario , the population size during a bottleneck should be tiny compared to the normal size , but still large in absolute numbers . the ratio @xmath749 is sometimes called the _ severity _ of the ( @xmath22-th ) bottleneck in the population genetic literature .",
    "given sequences @xmath750 and @xmath751 , classical convergence results for samples of size @xmath3 can be applied for the time - intervals between bottlenecks and `` inside '' the bottlenecks . since @xmath752 , the probability that any of the ancestral lines of the sample converge exactly at the transition to a bottleneck is @xmath753 , so that nave `` glueing '' is feasible .",
    "note that bottleneck events with @xmath754 become invisible in the limit , whereas in a bottleneck with @xmath755 the genealogy necessarily comes down to only one lineage ( and thus , all genetic variability is erased ) .",
    "since we fixed the @xmath756 and @xmath757 , the limiting process described in lemma  [ lemma : bottleneck ] is not a homogeneous markov process and thus does not fit literally into the class of exchangeable coalescent processes considered in this paper .",

    "in this situation , the genealogy of an @xmath3-sample from the population at present is ( approximately ) described by @xmath761 where @xmath762 is a subordinator ( in fact , a compound poisson process with lvy measure @xmath763 and drift @xmath683 ) .",
