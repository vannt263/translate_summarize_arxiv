    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite has allowed the creation of macroscopic quantum systems that are sensitive , isolated from the environment , and highly controllable , providing an excellent system in which to investigate many body quantum mechanics @xcite , as well as leading to the creation of the atom laser , a matter - wave analog of the optical laser @xcite .",
    "atom lasers are usually generated by creating a bec in which the atoms are trapped by magnetic or optical fields , and then changing the state of a subset of the atoms so that they are no longer trapped , and are free to escape .",
    "this can be done via rf spin flipping @xcite , or raman outcoupling @xcite , respectively resulting in a beam that falls under gravity , or a beam that can have some directionality due to a momentum transfer corresponding to a few @xmath0s@xmath1 .",
    "such coherent , directional matter beams offer great promise not only as a sensitive probe of the source condensate , but also offer potential in terms of atom interferometry and precision sensors . furthermore",
    ", both becs and atom lasers also offer the possibility of creating non - classical states that exhibit properties such as number and quadrature squeezing @xcite , which among other things have the potential to enhance the sensitivity of atom interferometers @xcite , allowing the measurement of electric , magnetic and gravitational fields , as well as rotations , with great precision @xcite .",
    "the creation of coherent matter beams can also be achieved by utilizing the inherent properties of the bec itself .",
    "this can be more useful than a conventional atom laser as not only can such beams carry information about the interaction properties , dynamics and quantum state of the bec , but depending on their method of generation they can possess highly interesting quantum states of their own .",
    "the dissociation of a molecular bec has been shown , for example , to lead to the creation of pairs of particles with oppositely - directed momenta that are expected to exhibit epr correlations @xcite , as can different forms of atomic four - wave mixing @xcite .",
    "one can also utilize colliding condensates resulting in a spherical shell of scattered atoms where opposite points on the sphere have correlations that depend on the the interation properties of the atoms within the condensate .",
    "most of these schemes , however , result in atomic fields that are not in easily accessible modes .",
    "they rely , for example , on collisions or dissociation resulting in scattering over the full sphere , beams that are co - propagating rather than spatially distinct , or that have their interesting quantum properties such as entanglement spread over a large number of resonant modes .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of a new method of generating correlated atomic fields , which has the advantages of being experimentally realistic and producing spatially distinct , coherent , highly - directed atomic beams at well - defined momenta .",
    "the beams are produced due to dynamic instabilities within the atomic system itself , and as such do not rely on molecular dissociation or colliding condensates , or the existence of engineered quantum optical fields to use as a template for the desired quantum statistics to be transferred to the atomic fields .",
    "our scheme is motivated by the experiment of dall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who exploited the combination of a metastable helium bec and a double stacked multichannel plate to image the transverse ( i.e. orthogonal to the propagation direction ) beam profile of an atom laser . at high outcoupling powers",
    "they observed an anomalous particle flux that was ejected along the long axis of the bec , and was well separated from the bulk atom laser profile . in this paper we develop a general theoretical model of a class of systems which includes that experiment , and demonstrate that pairs of correlated beams at specific quantized momenta can be produced .    in brief",
    ", our scheme requires a two - state bec that has a high aspect ratio , with the two states being coupled in some way .",
    "a further requirement is that the @xmath2-wave scattering length of the atoms within each state and between the states must not all be equal .",
    "one experimental realization of such a system would be a magnetically trapped condensate with two equally - trapped zeeman states , for example the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 levels of @xmath7 .",
    "another would be an optically trapped condensate using the quadratic zeeman shift to lift the degeneracy in the zeeman level splittings to create an effective two - level system .",
    "in both the optical and magnetically trapped cases the two levels could be coupled by two optical fields utilizing a raman transition .",
    "two - state raman coupling has been achieved experimentally in @xmath7 @xcite .    the existence of the coupling between the two levels , as well as the non - equal scattering lengths , results in dynamic instabilities in the condensate which can grow exponentially at specific well - defined momenta .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the equations governing the unstable system can be mapped to those describing optical parametric down - conversion , and have the same result  the generation of pairs of entangled particles with oppositely directed momenta .",
    "only the unstable momentum modes which have de broglie wavelengths that fit within the condensate are amplified , which results in the pairs being emitted along the long ( weakly trapped ) axis of the condensate .",
    "if the aspect ratio of the condensate is sufficiently large , a pair of highly directed beams will be generated .",
    "as part of our analysis , we will develop techniques for the application of bogoliubov theory to perturbations about a time - dependent mean field background , rather than a static one .",
    "a bogoliubov approach is necessary because the creation of the entangled pairs of particles is spontaneously seeded , meaning that analysis beyond the mean field is required . in its standard form bogoliubov theory assumes a time - independent mean field . in our case , however , the effect depends on the existence of a _ time - dependent _ mean field background , which suggests a bogoliubov - de gennes approach should be used .",
    "the usual drawback to such an approach is that the bogoliubov - de gennes equations are generally analytically intractable and are therefore solved numerically , which in many cases precludes deep insight into the problem . in this paper",
    ", however , we prove that the mean field background in our system , while time - dependent , is also periodic .",
    "this enables us to employ floquet s theorem to gain a semi - analytic solution to the problem of determining the excitation spectrum and instabilities of the system .",
    "the outline of this paper is follows : we begin by giving a brief overview of bogoliubov theory in section  [ secbogoverview ] , and demonstrate that the basic approach is still sound even in the presence of a time - dependent background . in section  [ secperiodicsolutions ]",
    "we solve for the mean field dynamics of our system , and map them to modified optical bloch equations with a nonlinear term .",
    "this enables us to prove that the mean fields , while time - dependent , are also periodic , regardless of the initial state of the system .",
    "the equations of motion for the fluctuations beyond the mean field are derived in section  [ sectionexcitationdynamics ] , and we show that in the special case of equal nonlinearities for the two atomic states they reduce to the standard bogoliubov excitation spectrum . in section  [ secinstabilitiesandexcitations ]",
    "we take advantage of the temporal periodicity of the mean field to employ floquet s theorem and show that the floquet exponents can indicate dynamical instabilities in the system . these dynamical instabilities",
    "lead to exponential growth of excitations at particular momenta .",
    "we also check the accuracy of the theory by performing truncated wigner simulations of the system to ensure the excitations occur where our floquet theory predicts , and derive the equations of motion for the annihilation and creation operators governing the excitations . as a further test of the validity of our theory",
    "we apply it to the experiment of dall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in section  [ sectheoryexperimentagreement ] and demonstrate that the anomalous particle production they measured is correctly described by our theory .",
    "in section  [ secentanglement ] we note that the equations of motion for the excitations are identical to those governing optical parametric down conversion , and thus should exhibit epr entanglement , at least on formation .",
    "finally , in section  [ secdiscussion ] , we discuss the optimal experimental system to generate the dynamical instabilities our theory predicts , and consider possible difficulties , and conclude in section  [ secconclusion ] .",
    "as described in the introduction , the paired matter beams generated in our scheme arise from a dynamical instability in the condensate , and in order to determine which modes are dynamically unstable , the excitation spectrum of the condensate must be obtained . to that end",
    ", we begin with an overview of the theory of condensate excitations beyond the mean field approximation , and then use these results to calculate the stability of the condensate and its excitation spectrum in section [ sectionexcitationdynamics ] .",
    "more comprehensive treatments of the bogoliubov theory can be found in @xcite and in a number of review articles ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is to determine the response of the condensate to small fluctuations about the mean field .",
    "typically the condensate is stable to such fluctuations , and their energy spectrum determines the phase and group velocities of the excitations . in the case",
    "that the condensate is dynamically unstable some modes will undergo exponential growth , which corresponds to the generalised energy spectrum containing non - zero imaginary components . as a concrete example of the techniques we will employ , consider a single - component condensate described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where an arbitrary energy offset @xmath9 has been included .",
    "this term is introduced for calculational reasons and has no physical influence on the hamiltonian as it can not affect any expectation values .",
    "this can be seen by noting that although it contributes a different energy offset for states with different total number , these states are uncoupled due to the hamiltonian ( [ eqelementaryexcitationsexamplehamiltonian ] ) conserving particle number . for the case of calculating the excitation spectrum of a ground state",
    ", the arbitrary energy offset @xmath9 will be identified as the condensate chemical potential .    to find the excitation spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eqelementaryexcitationsexamplehamiltonian ] ) we use the gross - pitaevskii equation to describe the mean field of the condensate , and then consider quantum - mechanical fluctuations about this mean field . to this end",
    "we define the deviation operator @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is considered to be a small quantity in the sense that its quadratic moments are small compared to @xmath13 ( its first - order moments are identically zero ) .",
    "the concept of @xmath12 being a  small quantity \" is not entirely trivial . for it to be considered in any sense small",
    ", the mean field @xmath14 must be non - zero .",
    "however the state of condensates with a large number of atoms is well approximated by either a state with well - defined total number or as a statistical mixture of coherent states with random phases @xcite . in both of these cases",
    "the mean field @xmath14 is zero , as the system has no well - defined global phase . as any _",
    "physical _ expectation value is independent of the choice of global phase , however , any analysis can be performed for a coherent state with a specific global phase , and the results then averaged over the global phase . because all observables will be made up of equal numbers of annihilation and creation operators ( since atom number is conserved )",
    ", the choice of global phase can not affect the final result .",
    "an alternative justification is to note that spontaneous symmetry breaking results in the selection of a specific phase , which is equivalent to assuming that the state of the condensate is unchanged on the addition of a particle , that is the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 are physically identical @xcite .",

    "measuring this entanglement is however a greater challenge as the local oscillators are more complicated , and it would require searching over a larger space to find the entanglement unless highly accurate theoretical predictions for the experiment were available .",

    "the effect depends on a nonlinearity mismatch , requiring that the s - wave scattering lengths in the system are not all identical , so that @xmath75 .",
    "this is not necessarily easy to achieve .",

    ", we performed a perturbation analysis beyond the mean field .",
    "as the mean field background about which we are considering perturbations is time - dependent , the standard approach would be to apply the bogoliubov - de gennes theory , which would result in a purely numerical solution to the dynamics . as our system is time - dependent but _ periodic _ , however , we are able to apply floquet s theorem to obtain analytic insights into the system .    from the period of the mean field evolution , we can extract the monodromy matrix describing the dynamics , the eigenvalues of which allow us to calculate the floquet exponents for the system .",
    "these floquet exponents are generally complex , indicating dynamic instabilities within the system .",
    "specifically , the real part of the exponents describe the energy spectrum of excitations within the condensate , while the imaginary part corresponds to exponential growth of the excitations .",
    "as the exponents are momentum - dependent , this results in the amplification of excitations at very specific momenta .",
    "the evolution of the annihilation and creation operators of the excitations are identical to those corresponding to the annihilation and creation operators of the photons in optical degenerate parametric down - conversion .",
    "optical parametric down - conversion is a well - studied and often - employed scheme to generate epr - entangled pairs of photons and , just as in the optical case , our scheme results in epr entanglement between two particle excitations with the same momentum magnitude but opposite direction .",
    "as the amplification can only occur if there exists substantial condensate population within a few de broglie wavelengths of the initial excitation , it is possible to create a situation when the entangled excitations are emitted directionally .",
    "this can be done by employing a high aspect ratio condensate , where the thomas - fermi radius in the tightly trapped axis is comparable to or less than the de broglie wavelength of the lowest momentum excitation , resulting in exponential gain predominantly along the long axis of the condensate .",
    "the narrower the condensate is , the more directional the entangled beams can become .",
    "the system we have analyzed in this paper is not difficult to arrange experimentally , and we have shown that an experiment matching our criteria resulted in particle emission along the long axis of the condensate at momentum that matches our predictions @xcite .",

    "the stability of ( [ eqappendixevolutionofangles ] ) about the fixed points may be used to demonstrate that there are no trajectories that approach the fixed points ( with the exception of the fixed points themselves ) . linearizing ( [ eqappendixevolutionofangles ] ) about the fixed points yields @xmath357 where @xmath358 and @xmath359 are the deviations from the fixed point and the identity has been used to simplify the result .",
    "the eigenvalues of this linear system of differential equations are @xmath360 which are pure imaginary as both @xmath70 and @xmath2 are real .",
    "this implies that there exist no trajectories near any fixed points of the system that asymptotically approach the fixed point .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical analysis of a coupled , two - state bose - einstein condensate with non - equal scattering lengths , and show that dynamical instabilities can be excited . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these instabilities are exponentially amplified resulting in highly - directional , oppositely - propagating , coherent matter beams at specific momenta . to accomplish this we prove that the mean field of our system is periodic , and extend the standard bogoliubov approach to consider a time - dependent , but cyclic , background . </S>",
