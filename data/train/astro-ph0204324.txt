    "the present dynamical state of clusters of galaxies should contain interesting cosmological information since the rate of growth of perturbations is different in universes with different matter content @xcite ; in an @xmath2 universe the perturbations grow proportionally to the scale factor [ @xmath3 , while in the extreme case of an empty universe , they do not grow at all [ @xmath4 constant ] .",
    "it is also known that @xmath5 universes behave dynamically as an @xmath6 universe at large redshifts , while at some redshift @xmath7 perturbations stop evolving , allowing clusters to relax up to the present epoch much more than in an @xmath2 model , in which clusters are still forming .",
    "note that a flat @xmath8 model behaves as an @xmath2 model up to a lower redshift than the corresponding open model , while for redshifts @xmath9 it behaves like an open model @xcite .",
    "this implies that clusters even in this model should be dynamically older than in an eds model @xcite",
    ".    therefore one should be able to put constraints on @xmath10 from the evolution of the cluster dynamical state .",
    "one such indicator , the cluster ellipticity , was recently proposed in @xcite ; the more elliptical a cluster the younger it is , since ellipticity should be correlated with the anisotropic accretion of matter and merging @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for a recent evolution ( @xmath11 ) of cluster ellipticity , defined in both optical and x - ray bands , based on various cluster samples , containing in total @xmath12 rich abell clusters . an earlier study , using clusters identified in the lick map @xcite , had also found that cluster ellipticity decreases with redshift for @xmath11 , due however to possible systematic effects involved in the construction of the data , the authors did not attach much weight to this result .",
    "this interesting finding was interpreted in @xcite as an indication of a low-@xmath1 universe , because in such a universe and under the hierarchical clustering scenario , one expects that merging and anisotropic accretion of matter along filaments @xcite will have stopped long ago .",
    "thus the clusters should be relatively isolated and gravitational relaxation will tend to isotropize the clusters reducing their ellipticity , more so in the recent times . a variety of indications do exist supporting the formation of clusters by hierarchical aggregation of smaller units along filamentary large - scale structures @xcite .",
    "although the cluster ellipticity is a relatively well defined quantity , systematic effects due to projections in the optical , that could increase the ellipticity of spherical clusters or decrease the ellipticity of flat ones , or the strong central concentration of the x - ray emitting gas ( since @xmath13 ) in the x - ray band , which in conjuction with resolution effects could reduce the ellipticity of distant clusters , should be taken into account .",
    "one should therefore use large and well constructed samples of galaxy clusters to verify such an ellipticity trend .",
    "furthermore , other indicators of recent cluster evolution should be used as well .",
    "for example , if the ellipticity decrease with @xmath14 is indeed due to recent dynamical relaxation processes , then one should expect an evolution of the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas as well as the x - ray cluster luminosity which should follow the same trend as the cluster ellipticity , decreasing at recent times , since the violent merging events , at relatively higher redshifts , will compress and shock heat the diffuse icm gas @xcite .",
    "another possible indicator could be the cluster velocity dispersion , which naively one would expect to increase at lower redshifts , since virialization will tend to increase the cluster ` thermal ' velocity dispersion .",
    "although there is a quite well defined @xmath15 relationship @xcite , unrelaxed clusters can also show up as having a high velocity dispersion due to either possible large peculiar velocities of the different sub - clumps @xcite or due to the possible sub - clump virialized nature .",
    "therefore , a better physical understanding of the merging history of clusters is necessary in order to be able to utilize the velocity dispersion measure as an evolution criterion .    in this letter",
    ", we will present further evidence for a recent dynamical evolution of clusters , using the optical apm and the x - ray xbac and bcs cluster samples and three indicators of cluster dynamical evolution , namely ellipticity , the x - ray cluster temperature and x - ray luminosity .",
    "details of the apm cluster sample and its construction can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we only remind the reader that the apm cluster catalogue is based on the apm galaxy survey , which covers an area of 4300 square degrees in the southern sky and contains about 2.5 million galaxies brighter than a magnitude limit of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied an objective cluster finding algorithm to the apm galaxy data using a search radius of @xmath17 mpc , in order to minimize projection effects , and so produced a list of 957 clusters with @xmath18 .",
    "out of these 309 ( @xmath19 ) are aco clusters , while 407 ( @xmath20 ) have measured redshifts .",
    "the apm clusters that are not in the aco list are relatively poorer systems than the abell clusters , as can be verified comparing their mean apm richness s , determined in @xcite .",
    "the apm cluster shape parameters ( ellipticity and position angles ) were estimated in @xcite and were used to measure the intrinsic distribution of clusters shapes ( found to be prolate - like ) .",
    "the shape parameters were estimated using the moments of inertia method on the gaussianly smoothed galaxy distribution , the angular smoothing scale of which depends on the distance of each cluster . an optimum grid size was selected based on an extensive monte - carlo procedure . in order not to bias the ellipticity measurements",
    "no circular aperture was used , but rather all cells above a selected density threshold were feed into the inertia tensor .",
    "three such thresholds were used to provide the shape parameters at three different scales and to test their robustness as a function of distance from the cluster center [ see details in @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "the shape parameters for all apm clusters as well as indicators of the dynamical state of each apm cluster will be published shortly ( plionis & basilakos in preparation ) .    here",
    "we will use the ellipticities of 903 apm clusters that have measured shape parameters ( 54 clusters are found in the vicinity of plate - holes or crowded regions and thus are excluded ) .",
    "we will also use the xbac @xcite and bcs @xcite rosat x - ray cluster samples to test whether there is any indications of a recent evolution of the icm temperature .",
    "details of the sample construction can be found in the original papers .",
    "we only note that the xbacs has a flux - limit of @xmath21 sec@xmath22 @xmath23 and contains 283 abell clusters , while the bcs , with its low - flux extension @xcite , has a flux limit of @xmath24 ergs sec@xmath22 @xmath23 and contains 304 clusters .",
    "most of the listed icm temperatures are estimated from the @xmath25 relation of @xcite , but a reasonable number of clusters have measured temperatures [ see table 1 of @xcite ] .",
    "the flux - limited nature of these samples create an apparent @xmath26 relation , as can be seen in figure 1 , and in order to avoid reproducing an artificial redshift evolution we construct volume limited subsamples ( the delineated regions of fig.1 ) ; one is a low - luminosity ( @xmath27 ergs / sec ) subsample , which spans a limited redshift range ( @xmath28 and 0.09 for the xbacs and bcs , receptively ) and one high - luminosity subsample ( @xmath29 ergs / sec ) , spanning a much larger redshift range ( @xmath30 and 0.24 for the xbacs and bcs , respectively ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of apm cluster ellipticities as a function of redshift ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the filled circles represent apm clusters that are also in the abell / aco catalogue .",
    "there is a definite trend of ellipticity with redshift in the direction expected from an evolution of the dynamical status of clusters , supporting similar claims of @xcite .",
    "table 1 summarizes the quantitative correlation results for all tests .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient for the @xmath32 correlation is @xmath33 and with a probability of being a chance correlation of @xmath34 .",
    "this result is robust to changes of the sample size by factors of two or three , depending on whether we use clusters with observed redshifts or different cluster richness ( see table 1 ) .",
    "tests were performed to investigate whether systematic effects in the shape - parameter determination method could be responsible for the ellipticity - redshift trend .",
    "already in @xcite a detailed analysis of the performance of the method as a function of sampling , distance and the presence of a projected random background galaxy distribution [ as predicted by the luminosity function of apm galaxies ; @xcite ] showed that such effects will tend to overestimate by @xmath35 the ellipticity of nearly spherical clusters ( more so for distant clusters - but only by 5% more ) , they will underestimate the ellipticity of flat clusters , more so at large - redshifts , while they will leave unaffected the clusters with ellipticities around the mean of the distribution ( ie . , @xmath36 ) .",
    "these effects could in principle bias the ellipticity redshift correlation , depending on the relative abundance of different ellipticity clusters .",
    "we investigate this possibility by performing a monte - carlo simulation analysis in which we assume the same underlying cluster ellipticity distribution at all redshifts . then using the individual apm cluster distance and richness characteristics we simulate , for each apm cluster ,",
    "1000 mock clusters having ellipticities derived by randomly sampling the corrected , for different biases , ellipticity distribution [ see fig.6 of @xcite ] .",
    "mock clusters are constructed having king profiles and the apm richness at the selected distance from the observer as in @xcite .",
    "the estimated background is overlayed on the cluster image , allowing however for clustering ( we take the extreme case that all the background galaxies are clustered at the distance of the cluster ) . from the resulting population of @xmath37900000 cluster ellipticities , which have the correct underlying apm redshift selection function , we randomly select @xmath38-times 900 ellipticities and estimate their correlation with redshift ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we find no significant correlation ( ie . ,",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , while only in 16 out of the 40000 cases do we find a similar @xmath32 correlation having the observed , or higher significance level",
    ". this number drops to 3 if we use a random , instead of a clustered , background in the mock cluster construction .",
    "since we have used the extreme case where all the background is assumed to be clustered at the distance of each apm cluster , we should consider the derived significance as an upper limit .",
    "therefore the true significance of the observed @xmath32 correlation , taking into account the possible redshift dependent systematic effects , is @xmath42 verifying that our ellipticity determination method , coupled with shot - noise and the projection of a clustered background can not create the observed @xmath32 trend .    regarding the @xmath43 relation ,",
    "we have found that there is indeed a correlation , especially apparent in the high-@xmath44 subsample , which spans a larger range in @xmath14 ( see figure 3 and table 1 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient for the combined xbac - bcs high-@xmath44 subsample ( were for the common clusters we have used only the more accurate bcs values ) is @xmath45 with probability of chance correlation being @xmath46 .",
    "this correlation is also apparent in each individual cluster sample as well , although with a slightly lower significance .",
    "a similar but weaker @xmath43 correlation is found in the low-@xmath44 sample .",
    "note , however , that many of the used temperatures are based on the @xmath47 relation of @xcite and thus this correlation could be a manifestation of an underlying @xmath48 relation . in order to investigate this possibility",
    "we restrict our analysis only to those clusters with measured temperatures , reducing our samples considerably ( by more than 50% ) , but the correlation of @xmath49 with @xmath14 persists ( see table 1 ) .",
    "especially for the low-@xmath50 sample the correlation now is even stronger and more significant . for the high-@xmath44 sample , where the sample number has dropped by a factor of 3",
    ", there is still an apparent correlation but the significance has dropped considerably .",
    "therefore , we confirm that cluster temperatures do evolve with redshift in the recent past .",
    "we return to the question of a possible recent @xmath50 evolution , which if present it could extend , through the @xmath47 relation , the already existing @xmath51 relation also to clusters with estimated temperatures . indeed , as seen in figure 4 , where we plot the @xmath50 versus @xmath14 ( see also table 1 ) , we do find such a relation with correlation coefficient @xmath52 and significance @xmath53 - 0.14 ( depending on the subsample ) .",
    "note , however , that if we use all the clusters in our subsample ( not only those with measured temperatures ) then we observe a correlation only for the high-@xmath50 sample ( @xmath33 ) which is weak and of low significance ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "it could be that clusters with measured temperatures have more accurately measured luminosities .",
    "we have presented evidence , based on the optical apm and x - ray xbac and bcs cluster samples , of a recent dynamical evolution of clusters , a fact to be expected if in clusters the merging and anisotropic accretion of matter along filaments have stopped and relaxation processes are now in effect .",
    "gravitational relaxation will tend to isotropize the clusters reducing their ellipticity , their icm temperature ( shock heated during the violent merging phase of their formation ) and their x - ray luminosity .",
    "we have found indications of varying strength and significance for all three of these effects , supporting similar claims of @xcite , on the basis of an ellipticity - redshift relation .",
    "these results appear to be consistent with the expectations of a low-@xmath1 universe .",
