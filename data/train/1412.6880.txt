    "an electromagnetic sampling calorimeter is one of the most popular detectors for detecting photons in high energy physics .",
    "it is usually composed of alternate layers of high - z converters and active materials sensitive to electrons and positrons .",
    "incident photons produce electromagnetic showers in the converter and their energies are determined in the active layers .    in this paper , we describe a novel photon detector with lead - aerogel sandwich used under an intense flux of neutrons .",
    "we choose aerogel cherenkov radiation as an @xmath1 sensing process so that it is insensitive to heavier particles .",
    "the detector is being used in a rare @xmath2 decay experiment@xcite at the j - parc main ring ( mr)@xcite . the experiment , named koto , aims to observe the cp - violating decay mode of @xmath3 with a sensitivity exceeding the standard model prediction ( @xmath4@xcite ) .",
    "an intense neutral kaon beam is needed to achieve the sensitivity .",
    "the beam contains large amounts of photons and neutrons as well as @xmath2s with typical energies of 10  mev , 1.4  gev and 2  gev , respectively .",
    "rates of the photons and neutrons are expected to be around 600  mhz each with the designed beam condition .",
    "figure  [ fig : koto ] shows a cross - sectional view of the koto detector assembly .",
    "the signature of the @xmath3 decay is a pair of photons from @xmath5 and no other visible particles .",
    "the two photons from the @xmath5 are detected with an electromagnetic calorimeter ( csi in fig .",
    "[ fig : koto ] ) placed downstream of an evacuated decay volume .",
    "a number of veto counters surrounding the decay volume hermitically ensure the existence of no other visible particles at the same time .",
    "the major background is expected to come from the decay @xmath6 , in which two out of the four photons escape detection . in order to suppress this type of background ,",
    "photon detection with high efficiency is essential .",
    "this requirement is also true for photons escaping into the beam direction , and the energy of these photons ranges 100  mev-5  gev .",
    "thus , an efficient photon detector which works inside the beam with a large flux of neutrons is needed .",
    "the crucial feature for the photon detector used in such an intense beam is blindness to neutrons , which is to reduce single counting rates and overveto probabilities of the signal events .",
    "various requirements on the detector , including the next two , were evaluated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations :    * the efficiency is > 99.5% for photons with the energy of 1  gev or greater . *",
    "the efficiency is < 1% for neutrons with the momentum of 2  gev/@xmath0 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_performance ] , we report various design studies to satisfy these requirements , including results of test experiments with positron and proton beams for verification of the detector response and tuning of the simulation . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the performance on photon detection in the neutral beam was evaluated for the partially - installed detector in the koto experimental area .",
    "we add an appendix to describe a measurement of the transmittance of aerogel radiators , which provided important parameters concerning the light yield .",
    "in this section , we first explain the basic concepts of the detector and describe its components .",
    "next , results of two test experiments with positrons and protons are reported . finally , we present results of simulation studies on the performance of the designed detector .",
    "the detector , named bhpv ( beam hole photon veto ) , is placed at the most downstream part of the koto detector assembly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : koto ] .",
    "it is composed of 25 layers of modules along the beam .",
    "the structure of a single module is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhpv single module ] .",
    "the main part of the module consists of a lead converter and an aerogel radiator as well as light collecting mirrors and photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "we chose a lead - aerogel sandwich counter as the module .",
    "photons are detected through cherenkov radiation of the converted electrons and positrons in the aerogel , which is known to have a small index of refraction ranging between 1.007 - 1.13 .",
    "this enables us to reduce sensitivity to neutrons since they tend to produce slow particles which yield no or less cherenkov light than @xmath1 .    in order to achieve high photon efficiency , optimization of the converter and radiator thicknesses and the refractive index of the aerogel is important . in general , a large number of sampling is required because each converter should be thin enough to reduce shower particles stopping inside the converter and the total thickness should be large enough to ensure conversion of photons into showers . in our case , the total converter thickness of 10 x@xmath7 and 25 samplings are adopted .",
    "the refractive index of aerogel is chosen as @xmath8 by optimizing the photon efficiency and neutron blindness .",
    "the arrayed configuration along the beam has an additional merit of reducing neutron sensitivity .",
    "we note that electromagnetic showers by high energy photons tend to develop into the forward direction while secondary particles such as protons and pions produced by neutron interactions have more isotropic angular distributions .",
    "thus , by defining photons as the events with hits in three or more consecutive modules , we can remove neutron events substantially .",
    "contribution from photons with the energy smaller than 50  mev in the beam can also be reduced by this requirement .",
    "quantitative results of studies , performed with mc simulations , can be found in sec .",
    "[ mcstudywithfullmodule ] . in the following ,",
    "we describe the structure of a single module in more detail .",
    "each single module consists of a lead sheet and aerogel tiles followed by a light collection system and pmts .",
    "the thickness of the lead sheet is 1.5 - 3.0  mm .",
    "two types of aerogel tiles with different sizes and optical qualities are used .",
    "they are named type - m and type - a as listed in table  [ table : aerogel ] .",
    "several layers of type - m ( type - a ) tiles are stacked into @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) grid in order to cover the transverse size of 300-mm - square , oversizing the actual neutral beam of 200-mm - square to detect diverging photons from @xmath2 decays .",
    "these tiles are wrapped with a thin polyvinylidene chloride sheet , whose transmittance is 90% for visible light , to maintain their rigidity .",
    "the optical system has two identical arms , each of which consists of a flat mirror , a winston cone@xcite for collecting light , and a 5-inch pmt .",
    "the advantages of the dual readout system include efficient and uniform light collection .",
    "in addition , single counting rates are cut in half , alleviating possible performance deterioration under high rate operation .",
    "the flat mirror is made of a 0.75-mm thick aluminum sheet coated by an anodizing method .",
    "the reflectivity is 85% over the visible light region .",
    "the winston cone ( 480-mm - long ) is designed to funnel the cherenkov light from the input aperture of 300  mm in diameter into the output aperture of 120  mm .",
    "it is made of an aluminum sheet by deep - draw processing ; its inner surface is coated with aluminum by vapor deposition .",
    "the average reflectivity is 85% for visible light .",
    "the 5-inch pmt , hamamastu r1250@xcite , has a bialkali photocathode with borosilicate glass .",
    "its quantum efficiency peaks around the wavelength of 400  nm with value of 20% , according to its catalog information .",
    "light emitting diodes ( leds ) are installed for calibration of the pmts .",
    ".parameters of the aerogel radiators .",
    "type - m tiles were used in the calibration measurement in sec .",
