    "much of the progress in understanding langmuir waves has been from the linear viewpoint , obtained by assuming that the perturbation of the plasma from its ( maxwellian ) equilibrium is `` sufficiently small '' such that second order terms in the perturbation may be neglected . under these conditions",
    ", one can derive the normal modes of the distribution function ( the singular case - van kampen modes @xcite ) or , alternatively , the landau damped `` modes '' of the electric field @xcite .",
    "a basic result of these linear analyses is that smooth , electrostatic perturbations tend to zero through the process of landau damping .    that such damping is not universal",
    "was first pointed out by bernstein , green , and kruskal ( bgk ) @xcite , who included the particles trapped in the electrostatic wave to formulate nonlinear distribution functions that give rise to time - independent electrostatic disturbances .",
    "explicit constructions of sinusoidal , small - amplitude bgk waves were later derived by holloway and dorning @xcite , in which they showed that even arbitrarily small amplitude waves can exist without being landau damped .",
    "bgk distributions are generally functions of the conserved particle energy @xmath0 whose charge perturbation self - consistently generates the electrostatic potential @xmath1 via poisson s equation .",
    "thus , bgk distributions are static solutions to the 1d vlasov - poisson system [ eqn : vlasovpoisson ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron distribution function and we consider the ions to have a time - independent density @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce and characterize nonlinear langmuir wave solutions to the vlasov - poisson system ( [ eqn : vlasovpoisson ] ) that are naturally occurring bgk - like waves . these waves ( and the distribution functions that generate them ) have particular relevance to laser - plasma physics , in that they dynamically arise as kinetic , nonlinear langmuir waves in systems that are weakly driven on or near resonance .",
    "to obtain these solutions , we use the canonical action - angle coordinates , finding that the plasma is well - described by a simplified distribution function that is gaussian in the canonical action . in this way",
    ", we obtain near - equilibrium solutions that approximate the fully time - dependent distribution function when the resonant forcing is small .",
    "while these notions may be reminiscent of adiabatic theory , we do not invoke adiabatic invariance , since we imagine that the plasma is resonantly driven .",
    "our calculation is more in the spirit of an averaged theory , in that the dynamical dependence on the canonical angle is ignored on the grounds of rapid phase - mixing in the langmuir wave , while the particle action evolves self - consistently .",
    "because these nonlinear , kinetic langmuir waves arise naturally in slowly driven systems , their bulk properties can be used to illuminate basic plasma processes and obtain reduced descriptions of complex phenomena .",
    "for example , the nonlinear frequency shift of the thermal langmuir resonance is an important quantity in any reduced model of raman scattering in plasma @xcite , and our results extend those of morales and oneil @xcite to colder plasmas and larger electrostatic potentials @xmath1 .",
    "we leave such an implementation in a langmuir envelope code to future work .    in sec .",

    "[ fig : portrait ] , superposed on a phase - space snapshot taken from a self - consistent particle simulation .",

    "in this section , we introduce our bgk - type distribution function _ ansatz _ that naturally arises in weakly driven plasmas .",
    "this results in a dramatic reduction in the number of degrees of freedom from the vlasov equation ( [ eqn : vlasov ] ) , and therefore can be used as the foundation of a simplified , fluid - like model .",
    "we first motivate our assumed functional form for @xmath3 , showing how simple physical arguments based on particle phase mixing in the slowly changing electrostatic field governed by vlasov evolution lead to a very simple distribution : gaussian in the canonical action @xmath46 with slowly evolving mean and fixed variance .",
    "we include an example from a slowly driven , self - consistent particle simulation that naturally evolves in this way , and compare it to the more familiar velocity - space distributions .",
    "finally , we give the distribution function in an explicit form from which phase - space averages can be computed .      the central assumption for our distribution function action _",
    "ansatz _ is that the langmuir wave amplitude and frequency are slowly evolving , meaning that the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the pendulum hamiltonian ( [ eqn : pendham ] ) do not vary appreciably over the period @xmath64 .",
    "for the nearly all electrons , i.e. , all except the exponentially few in a narrow range about the separatrix , the condition of `` slowness '' can be written as @xmath65 as previously noted , while these conditions are reminiscent of adiabatic motion , we do not explicitly invoke adiabaticity ; rather , we use the slowness condition ( [ eqn : slow ] ) to justify our assumption that the distribution function remains essentially uniform in the canonical angle @xmath66 throughout its evolution . far from the separatrices , it is clear that the slowness conditions ( [ eqn : slow ] ) imply that the electrons make many oscillations before the parameters of the wave significantly change , so that a set of these particles that is initially uniform in canonical angle remains so under evolution by ( [ eqn : pendham ] ) . as particles approach the separatrix where @xmath67 and the nonlinear period diverges @xmath68 , such a simple argument breaks down . in this case , we invoke the results of phase evolution by cary and skodje @xcite and elskens and escande @xcite , obtained by analyzing the near - separatrix motion in slowly evolving systems .    for most of the particles , the canonical angle is mapped smoothly through the separatrix . in a naive picture , the strip of particles in region i with the same action @xmath69 and spread over @xmath70 is mapped across the separatrix to the strip from @xmath71 that then rotates in region ii . as shown in @xcite , this picture is essentially correct to @xmath72 , excluding the exponentially few @xmath73 particles that pass very close to the hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "since these particles can spend an arbitrarily long time tracing the stable manifold , they lead to long , diffuse phase - space tendrils . neglecting these particles , to each action",
    "is associated a strip of particles that is mapped to one - half the canonical angle upon crossing the separatrix .",
    "this proceeds with each successive action strip , with each one displaced from the next by a relative phase in the canonical angle .",
    "the relative phase between increasing action strips increases up to @xmath74 , for which the action has increased by @xmath72 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . in this way",
    ", we argue that the distribution remains phase mixed to @xmath72 even when crossing the separatrix , provided only that the slowness conditions ( [ eqn : slow ] ) are met .",
    "assuming that the electrostatic wave amplitude and phase velocity are slowly varying , the previous arguments indicate that the distribution function remains uniform in the canonical angle throughout the range @xmath70 , resulting in the following simplification : f ( , ; ) f ( ; ) . to make further progress",
    ", we also assume that the distribution @xmath75 is well - represented by its first two moments in canonical action .",
    "this is trivially true if @xmath76 , for which @xmath77 and a maxwellian plasma is gaussian in action . in the general case ,",
    "this assumption is similar in spirit to a warm - fluid theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , for which asymptotic solutions are obtained by systematically neglecting the ( presumably small ) third- and higher - order moments in @xmath78 . by using moments in @xmath46 , however ,",
    "our model will self - consistently include the effects of trapped particles on the langmuir wave , as do the models of holloway , dorning and buchanan @xcite ; on the other hand , unlike the theories of @xcite , ours is non - relativistic .",
    "retaining only the first two moments in the canonical action is equivalent to prescribing @xmath3 to be gaussian in @xmath46 : f ( ; ) = \\{}. [ eqn : firstgaussian ] we can simplify ( [ eqn : firstgaussian ] ) in the following manner .",
    "the vlasov equation ( [ eqn : vlasov ] ) permits an infinite number of conservation laws ( casimirs ) , of which the entropy is one of particular physical significance : dd f ( , ; ) f ( , ; ) = 0 .",
    "[ eqn : casimirs ] using the gaussian - in - action distribution ( [ eqn : firstgaussian ] ) , the conservation of entropy ( [ eqn : casimirs ] ) implies that ( ) = 0 , [ eqn : entropy ] i.e. , that the gaussian width is fixed throughout the evolution .",
    "some care must be taken to apply this result across the separatrix where the action @xmath46 is not continuous ; note that this is an issue of coordinates , not dynamics .",
    "since the coordinate @xmath46 doubles across the separatrix , the width in @xmath46 similarly doubles . to be more precise , the phase space region @xmath79 , \\ ; [ 0 , 2\\pi ) \\right\\}$ ] just above ( or below ) the separatrix corresponds to the equal area region between the separatrices over the intervals @xmath80 , \\;[0 , \\pi ) \\right\\}$ ] .",
