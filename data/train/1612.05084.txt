    "the study of the dynamics of phase transitions started with the question posed by kibble @xcite .",
    "he noted that , in the rapidly cooling post  big bang universe , phase transitions must lead to disparate local choices of the broken symmetry vacuum .",
    "the resulting mosaic of domains with independently chosen vacua will in turn precipitate formation of topological defects with observable consequences .",
    "for instance , kibble theorized that the presently observed cosmological structures have been seeded by cosmic strings ",
    "an example of such defects .",
    "while the original estimate @xcite of defect density was incorrect , as it relied on an equilibrium argument @xcite ( hence , densities did not depend on the phase transition rate ) , the key question  whether transitions leave relics such as topological defects in their wake  can be also posed in the condensed matter setting and studied in the laboratory .",
    "the theory @xcite developed to estimate defect density for the second order phase transition relies on their non - equilibrium nature but also on the universality class of the transition : it uses equilibrium critical exponents to predict scaling of the density of defects and other excitations with the quench timescale .",
    "the size of domains within which symmetry breaking can be coordinated is given by the size of the `` sonic horizon '' that estimates how far the local choice of the broken symmetry can be communicated ( and plays a similar role as the causal horizon used bykibble @xcite to set lower bounds on defect density )    the usual estimate of the sonic horizon size relies on a power - law scaling of the relaxation time and the healing length with a distance from the critical point that is characterized by the dynamical and correlation length critical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a characteristic time - scale @xmath2 and a length - scale @xmath3 are predicted , where the quench time @xmath4 quantifies the rate of the transition .",
    "the correlation length @xmath5 determines the number of excitations as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) has been confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite and by experiments @xcite in a variety of settings , with most recent results providing evidence of the kzm scaling laws @xcite .",
    "refinements and extensions of kzm include phase transition in inhomogeneous systems ( see   for a recent overview ) , generation of winding numbers in the limit when flux trapping is a rare event @xcite ( and kzm scaling must be suitably adjusted @xcite ) , and applications that go beyond topological defect creation ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "recent reviews related to kzm are also available  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a zero - temperature quantum phase transition . despite important differences with respect to thermodynamic transitions  where thermal rather than quantum fluctuations act as seeds of symmetry breaking  the kzm can be generalized to quantum phase transitions @xcite , see also   for reviews .",
    "the quantum regime was also addressed in some of the recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently a fully fledged scaling hypothesis was proposed @xcite as a generalization and extension of the predictive power of kzm , though some of its basic ingredients were known from the beginning  @xcite . since in the adiabatic limit , when @xmath6 , both scales @xmath7 and @xmath8 diverge",
    ", they should become the only relevant time and length scales in the regime of low frequencies and long wavelengths .",
    "this in turn suggests a dynamical scaling hypothesis , similar to the ( static ) one in equilibrium phase transitions , that during the quench all physical observables depend on a time @xmath9 through the scaled time @xmath10 and on a distance @xmath11 through the scaled distance @xmath12 .",
    "what makes it really powerfull is the fact that the two scales are not independent : @xmath13 .",
    "this space - time renormalization hypothesis was confirmed in a precise experiment  @xcite where it proved useful in organizing the experimental data . in the following",
    "we also find it useful in organizing our numerical results .",
    "in this paper we consider the mott - superfluid quantum phase transition in the 1d bose - hubbard model that belongs to the kosterlitz - thouless universality class .",
    "this problem was touched upon in ref . where it was argued that , since the correlation length diverges exponentially near the critical point , one can not ascribe a definite scaling exponent @xmath14 to @xmath15 except for @xmath16 in the limit of exceedingly slow @xmath4 that are beyond any realistic experiment . however , when the range of @xmath4 is restricted to one or two orders of magnitude , then an effective scaling @xmath15 with an effective exponent @xmath17 can be a convenient approximation . in this paper",
    ", we readdress the problem , this time with fully fledged numerical dmrg simulations . like in a real experiment ,",
    "there are limitations that restrict the range of available quench times and the kz scaling hypothesis with effective exponents is a convenient approximation .",
    "we simulate linear quenches from the mott insulator to superfluid , where the range of correlations builds up as the tunnelling rate between nearest - neighbor sites is turned on .",
    "the spatial profile of the correlators and their time dependence satisfy the scaling hypothesis .",
    "we also simulate reverse linear quenches from the superfluid to mott insulator .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find the excitation during a ramp across the gapless superfluid to be negligible as compared to the excitation that builds up after crossing the critical point to the mott phase .",
    "apparently , the different critical superfluid ground states that are crossed by the linear ramp are similar enough for the excitation to be negligible despite their vanishing gap .",
    "what matters here is that a relatively large change of the tunneling rate during the ramp across the superfluid phase corresponds to a relatively small change of the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath18 that determines the ground state of the liquid .",
    "when measured by a distance between different ground states , the superfluid phase can be effectively identified as a single critical point .",
    "it is only after crossing to the mott phase that the ground state begins to change fundamentally .",
    "this inevitably makes the excitations build up until their growth is halted by the opening mott gap .",
    "the last crossover , that takes place at the time @xmath7 after crossing to the mott phase , is the essence of the quantum kzm .",
    "our simulations confirm this simple scenario by demonstrating that the excitation energy in the mott phase satisfies the kz scaling hypothesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a general discussion of the textbook version of the quantum kibble - zurek mechanism in section  [ sec : qkz ] .",
    "this generic version assumes gapfull phases on both sides of the transition and a power law divergence of the correlation length at the critical point .",
    "these assumptions are relaxed in section  [ sec : kzinkt ] where we introduce the 1d bose - hubbard model and consider the phase transtion from mott insulator to superfluid that belongs to the kosterlitz - thouless universality class . here",
    "the divergence of the correlation length on the mott side is exponential and the whole superfluid phase is gapless and critical .",
    "we recall relevant predictions of ref .   for this type of transition . in this paper",
    "these results are corroborated by numerical simulations described in sections  [ sec : misf ] and  [ sec : sfmi ] . in section",
    "[ sec : misf ] we describe simulations of the mott - to - superfluid transition and in section  [ sec : sfmi ] those of the reverse superfluid - to - mott quench .",
