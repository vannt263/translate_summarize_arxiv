    "in the study of population dynamics , it turns out to be very useful to classify individual interactions in terms of evolutionary games @xcite . early mathematical theories of strategic interactions were based on the assumption of rational choice @xcite : an agent s optimal action depends on its expectations on the actions of others , and each of the other agents actions depend on their expectations about the focal agent . in evolutionary game theory , successful strategies spread by reproduction or imitation in a population @xcite .",
    "evolutionary game theory not only provides a platform for explaining biological problems of frequency dependent fitness and complex individual interactions such as cooperation and coordination @xcite . in finite populations , it also links the neutral process of evolution @xcite to frequency dependence by introducing an intensity of selection @xcite .",
    "evolutionary game theory can also be used to study cultural dynamics including human strategic behavior and updating @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting open questions is how do individuals update their strategies based on the knowledge and conception of others and themselves ?",
    "two fundamentally different mechanisms can be used to classify strategy updating and population dynamics based on individuals knowledge about their strategic environment or themselves : imitation of others and self - learning based on one s own aspiration . in imitation dynamics , players update their strategies after a comparison between their own and another individual s success in the evolutionary game @xcite . for aspiration - driven updating",
    ", players switch strategies if an aspiration level is not met , where the level of aspiration is an intrinsic property of the focal individual @xcite . in both dynamics",
    ", novel strategies can not emerge without additional mechanisms such as spontaneous exploration of strategy space ( similar to mutation ) @xcite .",
    "the major difference is that the latter does not require any knowledge about the payoffs of others .",
    "thus aspiration level based dynamics , a form of self - learning , require less information about an individual s strategic environment than imitation dynamics .",
    "aspiration - driven strategy - update dynamics are commonly observed in studies of animal and human behavioral ecology .",
    "for example , fish would ignore social information when they have relevant personal information @xcite , and experienced ants hunt for food based on their own previous chemical trials rather than imitating others @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a form of aspiration - level - driven dynamics play a key role in the individual behaviors in rat populations @xcite .",
    "these examples clearly show that the idea behind aspiration dynamics , i.e. , self - evaluation , is present in the animal world . in behavioral sciences ,",
    "such aspiration - driven strategy adjustments generally operate on the behavioral level .",
    "however , it can be speculated that self - learning processes can have such an effect that it might actually have a downward impact on regulatory , and thus genetic levels of brain and nervous system .",
    "this , in turn , could be seen as a mechanism that alters the rate of genetic change @xcite .",
    "whereas such wide reaching systemic alterations are more speculative , it is clear that aspiration levels play a role in human strategy updating @xcite .",
    "we study the statistical mechanics of a simple case of aspiration - driven self - learning dynamics in well - mixed populations of finite size .",
    "deterministic and stochastic models of imitation dynamics have been well studied in both well - mixed and structured populations @xcite . for aspiration dynamics ,",
    "numerous works have emerged studying population dynamics on graphs , but its impact in well - mixed populations  a basic reference case , one would think  is far less well understood .",
    "although deterministic aspiration dynamics , i.e. , a kind of win - stay - lose - shift dynamics , in which individuals are perfectly rational have been analyzed @xcite , it is not clear how processes with imperfect rationality influence the evolutionary outcome . here",
    ", we ask whether a strategy favored under pairwise comparison driven imitation dynamics can become disfavored under aspiration - driven self - learning dynamics . to this end , in our analytical analysis , we limit ourselves to the weak selection , or weak rationality approximation , where payoffs via the game play little role in the decision - making @xcite .",
    "as it has been shown that under weak selection , the favored strategy is invariant for a wide class of imitation processes @xcite .",
    "we show that for pairwise games , the aspiration dynamics and the imitation dynamics always share the same favored strategies . for multi - player games ,",
    "however , the weak selection criterion under aspiration dynamics that determines whether a strategy is more abundant than the other differs from the criterion under imitation dynamics .",
    "this paves the way to construct multi - player games , for which aspiration dynamics favor one strategy whereas imitation dynamics favor another .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to deterministic aspiration dynamics , if the favored strategy is determined by a global aspiration level , the average abundance of a strategy in the stochastic aspiration dynamics is invariant with respect to the aspiration level , provided selection is weak .",
    "we also extrapolate our results to stronger selection cases through numerical simulation .",
    "we consider evolutionary game dynamics with two strategies and @xmath0 players . from these , the more widely studied @xmath1 games emerge as a special case @xcite . in individual encounters ,",
    "players obtain their payoffs from simultaneous actions .",

    "we examine the simplest case of an entire population having a certain level of aspiration .",
    "players need nt see any particular payoffs but their own , which they compare to an aspired value .",

    "when payoffs exceed the aspiration , strategy switching is unlikely . at high values of aspiration",
    "compared to payoffs , switching probabilities are high .",
    "the level of aspiration provides a global benchmark of tolerance or dissatisfaction in the population .",
    "in addition , when modeling human strategy updating , one typically introduces another global parameter that provides a measure for how important individuals deem the impact of the actual game played on their update , the intensity of selection , @xmath21 .",
    "irrespective of the aspiration level and the frequency dependent payoff distribution , vanishing values of @xmath21 refer to nearly random strategy updating . for large values of @xmath21 ,",
    "individuals deviations from their aspiration level have a strong impact on the dynamics .",
    "note that although the level of aspiration is a global variable and does not differ individually , due to payoff inhomogeneity there can always be a part of the population that seeks to switch more often due to dissatisfaction with the payoff distribution .    in our microscopic update process",
    ", we randomly choose an individual , @xmath23 , from the population , and assume that the payoff of the focal individual is @xmath24 . to model stochastic self - learning of aspiration - driven switching , we can use the following probability function @xmath25 which is similar to the fermi - rule @xcite , but replaces a randomly drawn opponent s payoff by one s own aspiration .",

    "thus multi - player games have attracted increasing interest in different areas @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward form of multi - player games makes use of the generalization of the payoff matrix concept @xcite .",
    "such multi - player games are more complex and show intrinsic difference from @xmath107 games .",
    "hence , as examples here we have studied the dynamics of one of the most widely studied multi - player games  the linear public goods game @xcite , a simplified version of a threshold public goods game that requires a group of players to coordinate contributions to a public good @xcite , as well as a multi - player version of the snowdrift game @xcite where coexistence is possible .",
    "our analytical finding allows a characterization of the evolutionary success under the stochastic aspiration - driven update rules introduced here , as well as a comparison to the well known results of pairwise comparison processes . while in coordination games , such as the threshold public goods game , the self - learning dynamics support cooperation on a larger set in parameter space ; the opposite is true for coexistence games , where the condition for cooperation to be more abundant becomes more strict",
    ".    it will be interesting to derive analytical results that either hold for any intensity of selection , or at least for the limiting case of strong selection @xcite in finite populations .",
    "on the other hand , the update rule presented here does not seem to allow a proper continuous limit in the transition to infinitely large populations @xcite , which might give rise to interesting rescaling requirements of the demographic noise in the continuous approximation @xcite in self - learning dynamics .",
    "our simple model illustrates that aspiration - driven self - learning dynamics in well - mixed populations alone may be sufficient to alter the expected strategy abundance . on previous studies of such processes in structured populations @xcite",
    ", this effect might have been overshadowed by the properties of the network dynamics studied _ in silico_. our analytical results hold for weak selection , which might be a useful framework in the study of human interactions @xcite , where it is still unclear to what role model individuals compare their payoffs and with what strength players update their strategies @xcite .",
    "although weak selection approximations are widely applied in the study of frequency dependent selection @xcite , it is not clear whether the successful spread of behavioral traits operates in this parameter regime .",
    "thus , by numerical evaluation and simulations we show that our weak selection predictions also hold for strong selection .",
    "models such as the one presented here may be used in attempts to predict human strategic dynamics @xcite .",
    "such predictions , likely to be falsified in their simplicity @xcite , are essential to our fundamental understanding of complex economic and social behavior and may guide statistical insights to the effective functioning of the human mind .",
