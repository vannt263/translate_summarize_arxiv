    "recent measurements of the meissner penetration depth@xcite and josephson interference effects in @xmath5@xcite have been interpreted in support of a spin - singlet order parameter belonging to the one - dimensional , @xmath4 representation , @xmath7 , which breaks reflection symmetry in the basal plane .",
    "such a pairing state has been proposed by several authors@xcite based on arguments that the cuo materials are fermi liquids close to an sdw instability .",
    "if the cuprates have an order parameter that is unconventional , _",
    "i.e.  _ one that breaks additional symmetries of the normal state besides gauge symmetry , then the superconducting state is expected to exhibit a number of novel properties , including ( i ) gapless excitations below @xmath8 , ( ii ) anomalous josephson effects , ( iii ) exotic vortex structures and associated excitations , ( iv ) new collective modes , ( v ) sensitivity of superconducting coherence effects to defect scattering and ( vi ) multiple superconducting phases.@xcite many of these signatures of unconventional pairing have been observed in superfluid @xmath9he , and in heavy fermion superconductors , notably upt@xmath10.@xcite the case for an unconventional order parameter in the cuprates , and particularly a @xmath4 state , is not settled ; there are conflicting interpretations of closely related experiments,@xcite variation in results that are presumably related to material quality or preparation,@xcite and experimental results that are not easily accounted for within the @xmath4 model.@xcite    in this paper we examine the long - wavelength current response in superconductors with an unconventional order parameter , and show how the _ field - dependence _ of the meissner penetration length can be used to detect the structure of the order parameter .",
    "this report extends our earlier work on nonlinear supercurrents,@xcite and provides the relevant analysis that could not be included in our short reports .",
    "specifically , we show ( i ) how the nodes in the excitation gap , whose multiplicity and position in momentum space depend on the symmetry class of the order parameter , lead to a nonlinear current - velocity constitutive equation at low temperatures ( @xmath11 ) which is unique and qualitatively distinct for each symmetry class . the effective meissner penetration length is _ linear _ in @xmath0 and exhibits a characteristic anisotropy for fields in the @xmath1-plane .",
    "( ii ) this anisotropy is determined by the _ positions _ of the nodes in momentum space .",
    "for example , in the case of a @xmath4 state in a tetragonal material the anisotropy is precisely @xmath12 , independent of the detailed shape of the fermi surface or the gap .",
    "( iii ) the nonlinear current - velocity relation leads to an intrinsic magnetic torque for _ in - plane _ fields that are not parallel to a nodal or antinodal direction .",
    "the torque scales as @xmath2 for @xmath11 and has a characteristic angular variation with a period of @xmath13 ( for tetragonal symmetry ) . the magnitude and angular dependence of this torque",
    "are calculated for thick superconducting films or slabs . ( iv )",
    "we discuss the effects of thermal excitations , impurity scattering and geometry for observing these features in a @xmath4 superconductor .",
    "recent measurements of the low - temperature , zero - field penetration length@xcite are used to determine the relevant material parameters for @xmath5 , which are then used to estimate the magnitudes of the field - dependence of the penetration depth and the torque anisotropy at low temperatures .",
    "our starting point is fermi - liquid theory applied to anisotropic superconductors ; section ii includes the relevant theoretical framework needed to calculate the current response in unconventional superconductors .",
    "we derive formulas relating the equilibrium supercurrent to the magnetic field and discuss the linear response limit in section iii .",
    "the nonlinear current - velocity constitutive equation is examined in section iv .",
    "a clean superconductor with a line of nodes in the gap has an anomalous contribution to the current which is a nonanalytic function of the condensate velocity , @xmath14 , at @xmath15 .",
    "the relation of the anomalous current to the quasiparticle spectrum is discussed , and the contribution of this current to the meissner penetration depth is obtained from solutions to the nonlinear london equation .",
    "the effects of impurity scattering and thermally excited quasiparticles on the anisotropy and field - dependence of the supercurrent are examined in detail ; the signatures of the anomalous current survive thermal excitations and impurity scattering at sufficiently low temperatures and weak ( or dilute ) impurity scattering .",
    "we discuss our results in light of recent experiments on the low - temperature penetration depth@xcite in single crystals of @xmath16 .",
    "an important conclusion is that if the linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth reported for @xmath16 is due to the nodes of a @xmath4 order parameter , then the nonlinear meissner effect , including the intrinsic anisotropy and field - dependence , should be observable for @xmath17 with a change in @xmath18 of approximately @xmath19 over the field range @xmath20 . in section",
    "v we discuss the nonlinear current , and associated in - plane magnetic torque , that develops for surface fields that are not aligned along a nodal or antinodal direction .",
    "the torque anisotropy ( or transverse magnetization ) is obtained from solutions to the nonlinear london equation at low temperatures .",
    "we also comment on a recent experimental report of a measurement of the in - plane magnetization@xcite of a single crystal of @xmath6 .",
    "in the rest of the introduction we briefly discuss the symmetry classes and unconventional order parameters for superconductors with tetragonal symmetry appropriate to the @xmath21 superconductors ( see refs .",
    "( ) for detailed discussions .",
    ")      bcs superconductivity is based on a macroscopically occupied equal - time pairing amplitude @xmath22 , for quasiparticle pairs near the fermi surface with zero total momentum and spin projections @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "fermi statistics requires that the order parameter obey the anti - symmetry condition , @xmath25 , while inversion symmetry ( if present ) implies that the pairing amplitude decomposes into even - parity ( spin - singlet ) and odd - parity ( spin - triplet ) sectors .",
    "furthermore , the pairing interaction separates into a sum over invariant bilinear products of basis functions for each irreducible representation of the point group .",
    "the resulting ground - state order parameter , barring the exceptional case of near degeneracy in two different channels , belongs to a single irreducible representation .",
    "for tetragonal symmetry there are four one - dimensional ( 1d ) representations and one two - dimensional ( 2d ) representation , and each of them occurs in both even- and odd - parity representations .",
    "the residual symmetry of the order parameter is just that of the basis functions for the 1d representations , but for the 2d representation there are three possible ground states with different residual symmetry groups . there is no evidence that we are aware of to support a spin - triplet order parameter in the @xmath21 superconductors ;",
    "in fact the temperature dependence of the knight shift in the cuprates@xcite is argued to strongly favor a spin - singlet order parameter.@xcite thus , we limit the discussion to even - parity , spin - singlet states ; however , most of the analysis and many of the main results for the current response are also valid for odd - parity states .",
    ".even parity basis functions and symmetry classes for @xmath26 [ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i summarizes the symmetry classes of the order parameter for spin - singlet pairing .",
    "all of the 1d representations have residual symmetry groups which include four - fold rotations combined with appropriate elements of the gauge groups .",
    "the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 have a residual symmetry group that allows only two - fold rotations .",
    "the resulting supercurrent , or superfluid density tensor , for such states is in general strongly anisotropic in the basal plane .",
    "the 2d order parameter , @xmath29 , preserves the four - fold rotational symmetry , but breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "although the @xmath30 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) order parameters break the @xmath33 rotational symmetry of the cuo planes , a combined @xmath33 rotation and gauge transformation by @xmath34 is a symmetry . since many properties of the superconducting state depend only on fermi - surface averages of @xmath35 , the broken rotational symmetry is not easy to observe . in particular ,",
    "the london penetration depth tensor is cylindrically symmetric for any of the 1d pairing states listed in table i. furthermore , all of the unconventional gaps in table i yield a linear temperature dependence at @xmath11 for the zero - field penetration depth ( in the clean limit ) .",
    "a distinguishing feature of each phase , which is a consequence of their particular broken symmetries , is that the nodes of each gap are located in different positions in @xmath36-space .",
    "a point that we make below is that the field - dependence of the supercurrent may be used to locate the positions of the nodal lines ( or points ) of an unconventional gap in momentum space .",
    "this gap spectroscopy is possible at low temperatures , @xmath11 , and is based on features which are intrinsic to nearly all unconventional bcs states in tetragonal or orthorhombic structures .",
    "our starting point for calculations of the current response is the fermi - liquid theory of superconductivity .",
    "this theory is general enough to include real materials effects of fermi - surface anisotropy , impurity scattering and inelastic scattering from phonons and quasiparticles , in addition to unconventional pairing . a basic feature of the fermi - liquid theory of superconductivity ( _ c.f . _ refs .",
    "( ) for a more detailed discussion of the formulation of fermi - liquid theory . )",
    "is that for low excitation energies @xmath37 , the wave nature of the quasiparticle excitations is unimportant and can be eliminated by integrating the full matsubara green s function over the quasiparticle momentum ( or kinetic energy ) in the low - energy band around the fermi surface , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normal - state quasiparticle excitation energy for momentum",

    "the pairing correlations are described by the @xmath44-integrated anomalous green s functions , @xmath45 the low - energy quasiparticle spectrum , combined with charge conservation and gauge invariance , allows one to formulate observables in terms of the quasiclassical green s function and material parameters defined on the fermi surface .",
    "for example , the equilibrium current is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the single - spin density of states at the fermi level and the integration is over the fermi surface with a weight factor of the angle - resolved density of states normalized to unity .",
    "we have introduced the @xmath48 quasiclassical functions in ` spin @xmath49 particle - hole ' space ; a convenient representation for the particle - hole and spin structure of the propagator is , @xmath50 this matrix structure represents the remaining quantum mechanical degrees of freedom ; the coherence of particle and hole states is contained in the off - diagonal elements in eq.([qcmatrix ] ) .",
