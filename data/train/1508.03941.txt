    "geometric frustration induced by competing interactions in quantum systems produces increased quantum fluctuations resulting in a range of distinct quantum phases with potentially rich phase diagrams.@xcite such systems can be low - dimensional if there are a sufficient number of competing interactions , which need to be comparable in magnitude to induce frustration .",
    "the example which we examine here is the cross - coupled two - leg heisenberg spin ladder .",
    "spin ladder systems are of considerable importance in condensed matter physics and have thus been widely investigated , with a number of known ladder compounds realised in experiments.@xcite the cross - coupled spin ladder has hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are spin-1/2 operators on rung @xmath3 and legs 1 and 2 .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the intra leg , inter leg ( rung ) and cross exchange couplings , respectively .",
    "the spin ladder couplings are depicted in fig .",
    "we are most interested in competing antiferromagnetic couplings , for which there have been conflicting results for the precise nature of the phase diagram .        the cross - coupled ladder model in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) has been investigated , using numerous methods , for over already two decades.@xcite after some debate it now appears settled that the phase diagram for antiferromagnetic couplings consists of a phase boundary separating rung - singlet and haldane phases . as emphasized,@xcite the entire region above the transition line is in the rung - singlet phase , being continuously related to the exactly solvable line @xmath7 along which an exact rung - singlet state is the ground - state in this phase .",
    "the entire region below the transition line is in the haldane phase , being continuously related to the point @xmath8 at which the ladder is equivalent to a spin-1 chain.@xcite    the debate centred over the existence or not of a columnar dimer ( cd ) phase intermediate between the rung - singlet and haldane phases which was predicted on the basis of weak coupling field theory renormalisation group arguments.@xcite this phase is between @xmath9 and @xmath10.@xcite subsequent numerical work motivated by this prediction disputed the existence of the cd phase .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , further numerical work provided evidence supporting the existence of the cd phase.@xcite in particular , the cd phase was claimed to exist in the range @xmath11 for @xmath12.@xcite this point was further addressed by more extensive density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations in the range @xmath13 for @xmath12 , from which it was concluded that the cd phase does not appear.@xcite the most recent work highlighted the fundamental limitations of the dmrg method when applied to the cross - coupled ladder.@xcite nevertheless , the existence of the cd phase in this model is beyond dispute for ferromagnetic couplings , as confirmed by a number of studies.@xcite    an efficient tensor network algorithm has been developed for spin ladder systems which generates ground - state wave functions for infinite length quantum spin ladders.@xcite in general , tensor networks have proven to be a convenient means to represent wave functions of quantum many - body lattice systems,@xcite and in particular , to calculate quantum fidelity as a measure of quantum state distinguishability .",
    "the ground - state fidelity per lattice site based on tensor networks has thus been established as a powerful tool to study quantum phase transitions regardless of what type of internal order exists in the quantum states .",
    "it has been demonstrated to directly ( i ) capture phase transition points due to changes of ground - state wave functions in the vicinity of quantum critical points @xcite and ( ii ) detect degenerate ground - states due to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite the quantum fidelity approach can thus be utilized to provide evidence for the existence or not of the cd phase , because by its definition,@xcite the cd phase is to be induced by a spontaneous breaking of lattice translational symmetry .",
    "motivated by the conflicting results for the existence of the cd phase in the antiferromagnetic regime and the advantages of the quantum fidelity and tensor networks approach , we have examined the cross - coupled ladder model , paying particular attention to the previously studied line @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we outline the numerical procedure for the tensor network based quantum fidelity approach for the cross - coupled spin ladder and define the relevant order parameters .",
    "our numerical results using this method are also presented .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the ground - state fidelity and tensor network states approach has been developed to study the criticality and phase diagrams of ladder models in ref . .",
    "we refer to that paper for technical details . the tensor network representation suitable to describe the ground - state wave function of an infinite - size spin ladder is a particular case of projected entangled - pair states ( peps)@xcite adapted to the geometry of the spin ladder system . for the two - leg ladder one needs to update four different four - index tensors .",
    "in this prescription the updating procedure is closely connected to the infinite peps algorithm@xcite and the translationally invariant mps algorithm.@xcite the computational cost scales as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the truncation dimension .",
    "for the two - leg heisenberg spin ladder it was demonstrated that the tensor network approach could very accurately determine the ground - state wave function , with truncation dimension @xmath16 outperforming the dmrg results.@xcite    fig2a.eps ( 0,80)(a )    fig2b.eps ( 0,80)(b )        for the cross - coupled spin ladder in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) we set @xmath17 , fix @xmath18 and vary @xmath5 as control parameter . with a randomly chosen initial state in the tensor network representation ,",
    "the updating algorithm of the tensors until the saturation of the energy in ref . allows us to obtain the ground - states of the spin ladder . for a given @xmath19 with @xmath12",
    ", we calculate the ground - state @xmath20 . in general",
    ", one can consider the quantum fidelity @xmath21 which is the overlap function between the calculated ground - state @xmath20 and an arbitrary reference state @xmath22 .",
    "the quantum fidelity scales as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the system size . following ref .  , the fidelity per lattice site can be defined as @xmath25 it satisfies properties inherited from the characteristics of the fidelity @xmath26 , namely ( i ) normalization @xmath27 and ( ii ) range @xmath28 .    when the arbitrary reference is chosen as a ground - state of the spin ladder ,",
    "the ground - state fidelity per lattice site has been demonstrated to be a universal marker for detecting the existence of quantum phase transitions , which are characterized by a pinch point on the fidelity surface , irrespective of the dimensionality of the system.@xcite for our system , then , one can choose the reference state @xmath29 to find a pinch point , i.e. , a phase transition point .",
    "in this case , the fidelity per lattice site satisfies one more property , namely ( iii ) symmetry @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the fidelity surface @xmath31 as a function of the rung coupling computed with truncation dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the fidelity surface satisfies the symmetry property for exchanging @xmath5 and @xmath33 .",
    "we find a pinch point at @xmath34 in the parameter range @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the pinch point at @xmath38 implies that a continuous phase transition occurs at @xmath39 .",
    "most importantly , only one pinch point in the fidelity surface is observed in the parameter range , which indicates that there are two characteristic phases .",
    "however , the cd phase was predicted to be intermediate between the rung - singlet and haldane phases.@xcite in other words , the existence of the cd phase implies that there should be two pinch points in the parameter range .",
    "consequently , the observed single pinch point on the fidelity surface indicates the non - existence of the cd phase in the parameter range .",
    "fig3a.eps ( -5,90)(a )    fig3b.eps ( -5,93)(b )      one can make a further check on the existence of the cd phase , which has not been applied to ladder models before . according to the landau theory for quantum phase transitions , if a phase can be characterized by a local order parameter , the phase is induced by a spontaneous symmetry breaking and , as a consequence , the system should have degenerate ground - states in the phase .",
    "if this theory is applicable for the cd phase , the cd phase should have degenerate ground - states . because the cd local order parameter @xcite is given by @xmath40",
    "the cd phase should be responsible for two degenerate ground - states .",
    "it vanishes in the rung - singlet and haldane phases .",
    "this local order parameter should be nonzero in the cd phase and is thus a measure of the existence of the cd phase .    to determine the existence of the cd phase , then , we need to detect degenerate ground - states .",
    "the ground - state fidelity per lattice site has been utilized in detecting degenerate ground - states for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite to apply this scheme here , for a fixed system parameter , we need to calculate ground - states repeatedly with @xmath41 differently chosen initial states for the tensor network representation .",
    "particularly , the system parameters are chosen to be @xmath42 with @xmath17 for @xmath12 , because these values were suggested to be in the cd phase.@xcite for our numerical study , the initial states have been chosen randomly and used to calculate ground - states with the truncation dimension @xmath43 .",
    "the reference state @xmath22 has been also chosen randomly and has been kept to calculate the fidelity , which allows us to distinguish different ground - states with the same saturated energy in the numerical calculation . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we plot the fidelity per lattice site @xmath44 for the number of initial trial states @xmath41 .",
    "twenty initial trial states are here presented to produce the same ground - state because there is only one observed value for the fidelity per lattice site @xmath44 . as a result , for this set of system parameters , the system does not undergo any spontaneous symmetry breaking and has a non - degenerate ground - state , which implies non - existence of the cd phase .",
    "the vanishing local order parameter @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) also manifests the non - existence of the cd phase .",
    "in contrast to the case of antiferromagnetic couplings , the cd phase is known to exist for ferromagnetic couplings ( @xmath19 and @xmath18 @xmath46).@xcite in order to compare with our results for antiferromagnetic couplings , we calculate degenerate ground - states for the parameter values @xmath17 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these values are known to be deep in the cd phase for ferromagnetic couplings.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we plot the fidelity per lattice site @xmath44 for the number of initial trial states @xmath41 . in the cd phase",
    "it is clearly observed in the same way that there exist two degenerate ground - states corresponding to the two values of @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , for a large enough number of random initial state trials , the probability @xmath49 of each degenerate ground - state approaches @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "this gives an explicit detection of the two degenerate ground - states for the cd phase which originate from a @xmath52 spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , as expected , the local order parameter @xmath45 exhibits two distinct values that have the same amplitude and opposite sign , i.e. , @xmath53 , where the local order parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are calculated from the two degenerate ground - states @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the relation between the two local order parameters manifests a @xmath52 symmetry breaking for the two degenerate ground - states .",
    "consequently , the sharp contrast between fig .  [ fig3](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) lends further weight to there being no cd phase for antiferromagnetic couplings .     and @xmath58 and the local order parameter @xmath59 as a function of @xmath5 for the cross - coupled spin ladder with coupling @xmath36 .",
    "thin lines are guides to the eye .",
    "the system clearly exhibits the haldane phase for @xmath60 and the rung singlet phase for @xmath61 .",
    "the local order parameter @xmath45 is zero , indicating the absence of the cd phase.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]      order parameters for distinguishing between the rung - singlet and haldane phases are nonlocal string order parameters.@xcite for two - leg spin ladders , we investigate the string order parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 defined by@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the order parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are each non - zero in one phase and vanish in the other . more specifically , @xmath62 vanishes in the rung - singlet phase and @xmath63 vanishes in the haldane phase . also , @xmath45 vanishes in the rung - singlet and haldane phases .",
    "the behaviour of the three order parameters can thus also be used as a means of locating the quantum critical point and the range of each phase .    in the previous subsection",
    ", we obtained the ground - states @xmath68 as a function of @xmath19 for @xmath17 and @xmath12 with truncation dimension @xmath32 to obtain the ground - state fidelity per lattice site in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we calculate and plot the order parameters from the ground - states in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that the local order parameter @xmath45 is zero for the parameter range .",
    "also , both the even / odd string order parameters @xmath69 vanish at @xmath70 .",
    "the string order parameters clearly identify the haldane phase for @xmath60 and the rung singlet phase for @xmath61 . as is detected from the pinch point on the fidelity surface in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the behavior of order parameters shows that a continuous phase transition occurs at @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , the order parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show further that there is no evidence for the cd phase .",
    "we have examined the phase diagram of the cross - coupled heisenberg spin ladder in eq.([ham ] ) with antiferromagnetic couplings using the recently developed tensor network states and ground - state fidelity approach for quantum spin ladders.@xcite this method has been demonstrated to be particularly effective for identifying quantum phases and transition points .",
    "we examined the particular coupling region @xmath72 for @xmath12 for which there have been conflicting results for the existence of the cd phase .",
    "we identified a continuous phase transition at the value @xmath73 and clearly observed the haldane and rung - singlet phases .",
    "however , we did not find any evidence for the existence of the cd phase .",
    "this conclusion was further supported by the use of a related spontaneous symmetry breaking method , which we tested in the vicinity of the critical point and for comparison in a region with ferromagnetic couplings where the cd phase is known to exist .    a particular symmetry of the hamiltonian in eq . ( [ ham ] )",
    "poses a strong constraint on the nature of the phase diagram for this model .",
    "it was observed that @xmath74,@xcite which is readily seen to be evident by inspection of the hamiltonian . defining the variables @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath76 this symmetry implies the  duality \" relation @xmath77 .",
    "thus the phase diagram for @xmath78 maps to the values@xcite @xmath79 consequently if the cd phase were to exist in the region @xmath13 for @xmath12 , then there must also be phase boundaries in the corresponding region @xmath80 for @xmath81 . yet",
    "no further phase boundaries have been observed in this region , which is consistent with the evidence for a single phase boundary , with no intermediate phase , between the rung - singlet and haldane phases .",
    "it thus seems plausable to rule out the existence of the cd phase in the antiferromagnetic region on symmetry arguments alone .",
    "it appears then that the only contentious point remaining for the cross - coupled spin ladder with antiferromagnetic couplings is identifying the order of the transition along the phase boundary .",
    "it is clear that along this line a singlet - singlet gap vanishes between the gapped haldane and rung - singlet phases .",
    "the early analytic and numerical results were consistent with the transition being first order for both weak and strong interchain couplings.@xcite however , later work suggested the transition was continuous for weak interchain coupling , becoming first order for stronger coupling.@xcite it has also been concluded that the transition is first order along the whole line.@xcite here we have seen that the transition is continuous at @xmath12 , @xmath82 .",
    "this supports there being some crossover point(s ) on the phase boundary separating lines of continuous and first order transitions .",
    "such a point is known to exist for the zig - zag ladder model , or equivalently the @xmath83-@xmath84 spin chain , which exhibits a single line of first order transitions for weak couplings crossing over to second order transitions for strong couplings.@xcite the precise clarification of this issue for the cross - coupled spin ladder deserves further study .",
