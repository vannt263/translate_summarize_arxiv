    "m82 is usually considered the prototype of starburst galaxies since the luminosity and star formation rate of its central star - forming region is comparable to the luminosity of a typical giant spiral galaxy ( e.g. telesco 1988 ; lester et al .",
    "imaging studies at optical and infrared wavelengths have shown that young , compact , luminous star clusters ( ` super star clusters ' or sscs ) are very numerous in the actively star - forming regions of m82 ( oconnell & mangano 1978 ; oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ; satyapal et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; de grijs et al .",
    "m82 provides an excellent and nearby setting in which to study the properties of young sscs .",
    "we adopt a distance to m82 of 3.6  mpc by assuming that it is at the same distance as m81 ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 ) , consistent with the red giant branch tip distance to m82 found by sakai & madore ( 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of luminous , massive sscs in starburst galaxies leads to the question : are these really ` young globular star clusters ' ( e.g. schweizer & seitzer 1993 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ; oconnell , gallagher & hunter 1994 ; meurer et al .",
    "differences in cluster luminosity functions between those for young sscs in starbursts and those of ancient globular cluster systems may present a problem . while globular star cluster luminosity functions peak at @xmath14 ( corresponding to @xmath15m@xmath4 ; see harris 1991 ; ashman , conti & zepf 1995 ) , the raw luminosity functions of clusters spawned in starbursts typically resemble the power law distributions found for open star clusters ( e.g. whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ; zhang & fall 1999 ) , although incompleteness may be an issue ( de grijs , oconnell & gallagher 2001 ) . a further complication can arise in the evolution of populations of star clusters within galaxies .",
    "fritze - v. alvensleben ( 1998 , 1999 ) emphasized the possible importance of differential survival rates , which favour dense , massive star clusters , such as compact sscs , and might transform the power luminosity functions of star clusters at birth into those of globular clusters ( see also chernoff & weinberg 1990 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "luminosity function measurements alone for populations of star clusters do not resolve this issue .    the questions of masses and densities of sscs are therefore critical ; do sscs have the mass densities of globular star clusters ?",
    "this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sscs to survive for @xmath16gyr time scales to become globular clusters . ho & filippenko ( 1996a , b ) measured stellar velocity dispersions for two sscs , ngc 1569a and ngc 1705 - 1 , with the hires echelle spectrograph on the keck i 10-m telescope .",
    "combining these data with half - light radii in the literature derived from observations with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , they found dynamical masses consistent with those of globular clusters . both of these sscs are relatively bright ( @xmath17 and 14.7 , respectively ) , young ( ages of @xmath18myr ) , and in small galaxies with low metallicities .",
    "the recognition that compact sscs may indeed be proto - globular clusters opens up the possibility of studying their formation conditions , evolution and destruction processes .",
    "one issue of particular interest is whether sscs have sufficient numbers of low mass stars to remain as bound systems over long time - scales .",
    "the slope of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is critical since too high a fraction of high mass stars will cause the cluster to evaporate within a few gyr due to stellar mass - loss ( e.g. chernoff & weinberg 1990 ; goodwin 1997 ; takahashi & portegies zwart 2000 ) .",
    "it is not obvious whether all young sscs have ` normal ' mfs .",
    "for example , the best studied galactic example , ngc  3603 , has a normal mf extending down to @xmath191  according to eisenhauer et al .",
    "the compact young galactic centre clusters , the arches and quintuplet , appear to have remarkably flat mfs for m@xmath2010  ( figer et al . 1999 ) , although they have probably undergone rapid mass segregation ( kim , morris & lee 1999 ) and could even represent the dense cores of dissolved clusters ( gerhard 2001 ) .    in the lmc ssc r136 , massey and hunter ( 1998 ) demonstrated a normal mass function for stars with @xmath21m@xmath4 while sirianni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the mass function flattens below 2m@xmath4 ; the r136 mf could be slightly ` top - heavy ' compared to that for lmc field stars .",
    "similarly , sternberg ( 1998 ) suggests a deficiency of low mass stars in ngc  1705 - 1 .",
    "spectra of sscs in the peculiar galaxy ngc  1275 taken with the keck i telescope show unusually strong h - balmer lines ; brodie et al .",
    "( 1998 ) interpret these as evidence for flat mfs in clusters that are about 350  myr old .",
    "more generally there has been much debate over the slope of the imf in starburst galaxies , and particularly , in m82 .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 1980 ) first suggested that the m82 starburst has a deficit of stars below 3m@xmath4 on the basis of its high @xmath22 band luminosity and relatively small dynamical mass .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) used up - dated models and observational constraints from mcleod et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to demonstrate further that the m82 starburst has an mf biased towards more massive stars .",
    "doane & mathews ( 1993 ) also find that the m82 mf must be top - heavy to explain both the high supernova rate and low dynamical mass . on the other hand , satyapal et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) derived a smaller value for the extinction - corrected @xmath22 band luminosity and found that the mf could be consistent with a salpeter slope .",
    "in a previous paper ( gallagher & smith 1999 ; hereafter paper i ) , we presented a spectroscopic study of two m82 sscs , denoted f and l by oconnell & mangano ( 1978 ) .",
    "m82-f is one of the most luminous sscs known ( oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ) and is located 440pc south - west of the nucleus .",
    "we found that its radial velocity indicated that it could be buried deep within m82 and fortuitously viewed through a hole in the dust layer .",
    "conversely , the nearby cluster m82-l is highly reddened but its radial velocity indicates that it lies near the middle of the m82 disc .",
    "our blue spectrum of m82-f shows mid - b type spectral features and the red spectra of m82-f and m82-l have a strong caii triplet and numerous f- and g - type absorption lines .",
    "we compared the blue spectrum of m82-f with theoretical model cluster spectra using the pegase spectral synthesis code ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , and derived an age of @xmath8myr .",
    "for m82-l , we find that the similarities in the strength of the caii triplet and overall spectral appearance with m82-f suggest a similar age .",
    "the location away from the central starburst and compactness of m82-f make it an ideal candidate in m82 for determining its dynamical mass by measuring its size and internal velocity dispersion .",
    "it is an important addition to sscs with dynamical masses because it is older and probably more metal - rich than the two ssc dynamical mass measurements by ho & filippenko ( 1996a , b ) , but has the disadvantage of being relatively faint , @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we present the results of such a study based on high dispersion echelle spectroscopy obtained at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "we compare the dynamical mass of m82-f with those determined for other young sscs by ho and filippenko ( 1996a , b ) , using up - dated parameters .",
    "in particular , we discuss its luminosity - to - mass ratio in the context of imf models that lack lower mass stars .",
    "the form of the imf in turn affects the ability of the cluster to survive as a bound system and thus its status as a young globular star cluster .",
    "we also discuss the dynamics of neutral and ionized gas in the line of sight to m82-f through the analysis of the nai interstellar lines and various hii region emission lines .",
    "in fig .  [ hst_wf ] , the locations of clusters f and l within m82 are shown using @xmath24-band images taken with the wiyn  3.5-m telescope and the wide field planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) onboard _ hst_. the wfpc2 image was obtained from the _ hst _ archive and is an average of two 200s exposures in the f814w filter .",
    "there are also @xmath25-band ( two 350  s exposures in the f555w filter ) and @xmath26-band ( two 400  s exposures in the f439w filter ) images available .",
    "these images were taken as part of the go 7446 program ( r. w. oconnell , p.i . ) to investigate star clusters and other features of the visible surface of the m82 starburst ( see de grijs et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "they were not designed for measurements of bright star clusters such as m82-f , and this introduced some complications .",
    "images of m82-f and m82-l are both on the wfpc2 wf4 ccd , which has an image scale of 0.1  arcsec pixel@xmath1 .",
    "we worked from combined pairs of images in each filter , and used standard iraf software to remove cosmic rays ( there were no major cosmic ray hits on or near m82-f ) .",
    "the f439w short exposure images are unsaturated and give a true measure of the m82-f brightness profile . both the f555w and f814w images contain 9 saturated pixels ( due to the wfpc2 a / d converter response ) in the m82-f cluster centre .",
    "we corrected these by using the f439w image as a template and replaced the saturated pixels with values scaled from the surrounding regions of the cluster in the f555w and f814w bands . to estimate the error",
    ", we arbitrarily increased the values of all saturated pixels by 30 per cent , and find that this leads to an increase of slightly more than 0.1 magnitudes in the brightness of m82-f in both the f555w and f814w images .",
    "the method we have used assumes that there is no radial colour gradient present in m82-f .",
    "any colour changes are expected to be small since typical gradients of at most @xmath27 mag are observed in rich lmc clusters ( elson , fall & freeman 1987 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt an error of @xmath28 mag for the @xmath25 and @xmath24 magnitudes of m82-f .",
    "the f439w and f814w images of m82-f are shown in fig .",
    "[ hst_f_bi ] .",
    "m82-l is very bright in the f814w - band but essentially absent in f439w .",
    "we also see that m82-f has a companion star cluster at a projected distance of 0.7  arcsec along a position angle of 50@xmath29 .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on m82-f and its companion .",
    "the region of the companion cluster was replaced with the mean background for the m82-f photometry .",
    "a circular aperture with a 7 pixel radius was chosen for the total magnitude measurement .",
    "the background was measured from the centroid of the distribution of pixel brightnesses in an annulus at 1214 pixels .",
    "magnitudes were transformed to the landolt @xmath30 system following the precepts of holtzman et al .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( table  [ tab_par ] ) . using a smaller aperture of radius 0.5  arcsec",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 ; oconnell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used observations taken with the original wfpc to estimate a deconvolved @xmath34 within the same radius .",
    "photometry of the companion star cluster was performed by estimating a constant background which was derived by assuming that m82-f has a symmetric structure , and then using the mean count rates on the side opposite of the cluster to the companion .",
    "this procedure yielded for the m82-f companion cluster @xmath35 and @xmath36 using a 5 pixel radius circular aperture .",
    "due to the faintness of this object with respect to the galaxy background and proximity of m82-f , we could not obtain reliable photometry from the f814w wfpc2 image .    from circular aperture photometry on m82-f",
    ", we measure a half - light radius @xmath37(f439w)@xmath38  arcsec ( 1 pixel @xmath39  arcsec ) .",
    "the ratio of major to minor axes was determined to be about 1.3 using an ellipse fitting routine in the iraf software package .",
    "this gives a negligible ellipticity correction of @xmath40  arcsec for the effective radii of circular apertures used for the photometry . to correct for the effects of blurring of the point - spread - function ( psf ) of the wf cameras of wfpc2",
    ", we used the simple approach of phillips et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who suggest subtracting @xmath41  arcsec from the observed value in quadrature .",

    "a psf correction was derived from measurements of stars surrounding the cluster to be 1.8 wfpc2/pc pixels , or 0.082  arcsec .",
    "the measured projected half - light radius for the central star cluster measured from multiple aperture photometry is 2.25 pixels , and thus @xmath46  arcsec .",

    "in addition , two atmospheric standards and eight template stars were observed ranging in spectral type from a7iii to m2iab .",
    "the echelle data were reduced using the figaro software package ( shortridge et al .",
    "each frame was cleaned of cosmic rays , bias corrected and divided by a normalized flat field .",
    "the individual orders were next extracted for the object and two adjacent background regions ( sky @xmath59 galaxy ) and wavelength calibrated .",
    "the orders were then background - subtracted , binned to 4kms@xmath1 wide intervals , and co - added . finally the orders were merged in the overlap regions and normalized to unity using spline fits .",

    "the peak of the co rotation curve lies between the 120 kms@xmath1 and 50 kms@xmath1 emission components ( shen & lo 1995 ) .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of m82-f is measured to be @xmath66 kms@xmath1 from the caii triplet lines , in good agreement with the value of @xmath67 kms@xmath1 obtained in paper i.    the first two velocity components are resolved in the first three spatial pixels but appear to merge to produce two components at @xmath68 and @xmath64 kms@xmath1 at the position of m82-f on the slit ( fig .  [ ech_vel ] ) .",

    "the presence of multiple sharp components in the d@xmath75 line demonstrates that this feature is due to intervening interstellar gas rather than stellar photospheres as assumed in some previous studies ( e.g. sait et al .",

    "shen & lo ( 1995 ) propose that the high velocity dispersion molecular emission originates in spiral arms where previous starburst activity disrupted the interstellar medium .",
    "high angular resolution maps of gas kinematics in the outer disc of m82 would be very useful in disentangling the multiple interactions in this peculiar system .",
    "the wavelength region of the ues observations ( 57609140 ) was chosen because , as discussed by ho & filippenko ( 1996a , b ) , and demonstrated by our intermediate dispersion spectra of m82-f ( paper i ) , the spectral region longward of 5000   is dominated by the light of cool evolved stars .",

    "comparison of the ratios of the strengths of these lines to the caii triplet lines shows that the closest spectral match is to the two k stars .",
    "we have used these three stars as templates and cross - correlated their spectra with that of m82-f .",
    "we chose four spectral regions which are free of telluric absorption lines : 60106275  , 63206530  , 73407590  , and 77058132 for the analysis .",
    "all these regions gave a strong cross - correlation signal ; an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ ccf ] where we also show the spectrum of an atmospheric standard .",
    "we ignored the region containing the caii triplet because these lines are saturated in the template spectra and broad paschen absorption lines from early - type stars are present in the m82-f spectrum .",

    "the relationship between the fwhm and the velocity dispersion was empirically calibrated by broadening the template spectra with gaussians of different velocity dispersions and cross - correlating with the original spectra .",
    "we find that relative to hr 6863 ( f8ii ) , hr 1529 ( k1 iii ) and hr 6498 ( k3 iab ) , the velocity dispersion of m82-f is @xmath0 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 kms@xmath1 respectively , where the errors represent the @xmath83 dispersion on the mean .",
    "the values derived using the f and k template spectra are different because the intrinsic photospheric absorption line widths are smaller in the two k stars .",
    "it is surprising to find that the k3 iab star in our sample has the same line widths as the k1 giant , suggesting the k3 star may be wrongly classified in terms of its luminosity .",
    "the velocity dispersions derived from cross - correlating the two k stars ( hr 1529 and 6498 ) with the f8 bright giant are @xmath84 and @xmath85 kms@xmath1 respectively , and are entirely consistent with the differences in the cluster velocity dispersions found from the various template stars .",
    "to choose the appropriate velocity dispersion value for m82-f , we need to determine which template star provides the best spectral / luminosity match and consider the effects of macroturbulent broadening in the atmospheres of cool evolved stars . in bright giants",
    "macroturbulence is the dominant factor in setting weaker stellar absorption line profile widths , and this depends primarily on luminosity class for cooler stars . as discussed above , the closest spectral match is to the two k stars . inspection of the starburst99 code ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) shows that kii stars dominate the ues wavelength region at an age of 60 myr ( paper i ) .",
    "we thus choose the f8ii template star since gray & toner ( 1986 ) show that the macroturbulent broadening in f5k4 luminosity class ii bright giants is very similar with a mean value of @xmath86 kms@xmath1 , while the kiii stars have sharper lines , in agreement with our results .",
    "we therefore adopt a velocity dispersion @xmath87 of @xmath0 kms@xmath1 for m82-f .",
    "_ m82-f has a sufficiently large stellar velocity dispersion to be a proto - globular cluster .",
    "_      the mass of m82-f can be obtained from the virial theorem since the average stellar crossing time of @xmath88 yr is much less than the cluster age , and thus the cluster should be near virial equilibrium .",
    "the virial mass @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 where it is assumed that the cluster is spherical with an isotropic velocity distribution such that @xmath87 represents the one - dimensional rms velocity dispersion along the line - of - sight ( spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "with the radius expressed in terms of the half - mass radius @xmath91 ( rather than the gravitational radius ) , the constant of proportionality is 7.5 ( see e.g. the review of gerhard 2000 ) . further assuming that the half - light radius derived from the wfpc2 image ( sect .",

    "the discussion of these points by ho and filippenko ( 1996b ) on the connection between massive sscs and ultra - dense molecular clouds in m82 is borne out by our observations .",

    "are found at the cluster s velocity , blueshifted by almost 170  km  s@xmath1 with respect to the centroid of m82 .",
    "the cluster evidently has had time to completely separate itself from any natal gas .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that the cluster is old enough to have made more than one revolution about the centre of m82 ; it is now well - removed from its birthplace and faces an uncertain future .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ lum_r ] , m82-f is too young to have experienced significant dynamical mass segregation .",
    "some star clusters , however , seem to have been born with their massive stars centrally concentrated .",
    "the orion nebula cluster sets an example of this phenomenon ; massive stars are centrally located but the cluster is far too young for two - body relaxation to have played a role ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",

    "fischer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reach a similar conclusion for the 100  myr old lmc star cluster ngc  2157 .",
    "thus , if mass - segregation is playing a significant role in m82-f , it must have been present at birth .",
    "m82-f should therefore have an extended halo of low mass stars if primordial mass segregation has occurred . to test for this possibility , we take an extreme model where the velocity dispersion is the same and assume that low mass stars affect the mass and not the luminosity .",
    "the half - light radius has then to increase by a factor of 5 to 14  pc for @xmath5 to agree with a kroupa - type imf . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ hst_f_bi ] , clusters f and l are @xmath166  pc apart .",
    "this increase is well beyond the radius where we can detect m82-f , and while not impossible , there is no evidence at present to support such an extended halo .",
    "the other alternative is that m82-f has had its halo of low mass stars removed by a process such as tidal stripping .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed to explain the peculiar mass functions of the galactic centre clusters ( gerhard 2001 ) .",
    "while m82-f does have a peculiar orbit , it seems unlikely that it could have been born in a location with large tidal stresses because such an environment is not obviously present in m82 .",
    "the data for the two younger sscs ngc 1569a and 1705 - 1 are inconclusive .",
    "the former cluster appears to have a normal mf while the latter has a truncated mf yet both clusters reside in the inner parts of their galaxies .",
    "we conclude that while mass segregation at birth may have occurred in m82-f , the current observational evidence favours the view that the imf of m82-f was abnormal in being deficient in low mass stars .",
    "future spatially - resolved spectroscopy of m82-f is needed to investigate the significance of mass segregation .      predicting the lifetime of a star cluster is difficult .",
    "the simplest model assumes a cluster is in virial equilibrium and therefore must expand in response to any mass loss . in the case of m82-f",
    "this will be dominated by effects due to stellar evolution . at the age of m82-f",
    ", the ssp models with lower mass cut - offs of 2 and 3  m@xmath4 , show that 49 and 60 per cent of the original mass has been ejected .",
    "therefore , the cluster should soon have too little mass to remain bound with a constant stellar velocity dispersion ; i.e. it will reach positive total energy .",
    "how long the cluster can endure depends on the actual form of the imf , but since we expect that less than half of the original stellar mass resides in stars with m@xmath192  m@xmath4 , the cluster should begin to dissolve in the next 12  gyr as stars in this mass range complete their evolution .",
    "we therefore adopt a probable lifetime for the ssc m82-f in its present massive form of @xmath167  gyr .",
    "of course star clusters are subject to a variety of internal and external evolutionary influences beyond those imposed by stellar evolution and the imf , including tidal radius limits , stellar mass segregation , and the nature of the stellar velocity distribution function ( see chernoff & shapiro 1987 ) .",
    "the general impact of these additional influences is to promote cluster expansion and thereby reduce the cluster lifetime , since expansion causes increased vulnerability of stars to tidally - induced mass loss ( spitzer 1987 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "a cluster s long term prospects further depend on its orbit , and the importance of dynamical heating of its stars by processes such as disc shocking ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . models of dense star clusters therefore generally require a steep imf extending to masses well below that of the sun to insure cluster survival over cosmic time scales . for clusters with lower mass limits of @xmath770.1  m@xmath4 ,",
    "imf slopes of @xmath1682.3 - 2.5 are preferred for durable clusters in the milky way , and clusters with @xmath169 will disrupt even when the tidal field is weak , as in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "thus again , we are left with the question of whether the ancient globular clusters , and especially those near the dense centres of giant galaxies , were formed by some process that was preferred at early epochs ( see zhang & fall 1999 ) ?",
    "alternatively , it may simply be that the survivors were picked out from what was initially a varied population of sscs ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "the large radial velocity of m82-f with respect to its host galaxy implies that m82-f can not be on a simple circular orbit within the disc of m82 .",
    "it may be subject to some degree of disc shocking as well as a moderate tidal radius constraint of about 35  pc produced by m82 .",
    "this is sufficiently large that tides should not have an immediate impact on the structure of m82-f .",
    "however , if the cluster begins to expand due to mass loss , as expected within the next 2  gyr , then tides will help to disperse the escaping stars .",
    "we measure a stellar radial velocity dispersion of 13.4@xmath1220.7  km  s@xmath1 for the super star cluster m82-f .",
    "this result in combination with a new determination of the projected half - light radius of @xmath1702.8@xmath1220.3  pc yields a dynamical mass estimate of @xmath3  m@xmath4 for m82-f .",
    "wfpc2 archival observations together with a revised estimate for the minimum amount of interstellar obscuration give @xmath171 or @xmath172  l@xmath4 .",
    "the luminosity - to - mass ratio is then @xmath103 .",
    "these parameters show that m82-f has the luminosity and mass to qualify as a young globular star cluster .",
    "unlike most optically luminous sscs , m82-f is middle - aged ; we reconfirm our earlier age estimate of 60@xmath12220  myr from paper i based on fits to the h@xmath113 and he  i @xmath1734922 absorption line profiles .",
    "_ m82-f is a factor of 5 times too luminous for a star cluster of its age with a standard stellar mass function extending to 0.1  m@xmath4 .",
    "our data require that m82-f has a deficiency of low mass stars , at least within the optically bright component of the cluster .",
    "_    m82-f appears to be unique for an object of its age in displaying the enhanced @xmath5 predicted for top - heavy imfs that are deficient in low mass stars .",
    "while this type of behaviour is seen in galactic centre clusters for m@xmath163  m@xmath4 , it is not yet known if this behaviour applies to lower stellar masses within these star clusters , or if such objects should be expected to exist outside of the very dense centres of giant galaxies .",
    "our models suggest that the lower mass limit for m82-f is 23  m@xmath4 for an imf slope of 2.3 , and much of the mass is then near the lower stellar mass cutoff .",
    "we have considered obvious sources of error but have found none that would substantially change our conclusions . in particular , we have investigated the question of mass segregation and find no current observational evidence to support this possibility . while modern forms of the imf which have fewer low mass stars than a salpeter imf provide better agreement with our observed @xmath5 ratio , they do not help with the dynamical problem of having sufficient low mass stars to hold the cluster together over cosmic time spans . in this case",
    ", the m82-f cluster is steadily losing mass due to mass lost by evolving stars , and should dissolve within the next 12  gyr .",
    "_ if the cluster is limited to what we see , its high mass and density are not sufficient to assure its survival without sufficient mass in the form of long - lived , low mass stars .",
    "m82-f can not then be considered as a proto - globular cluster .",
    "_    the history of evidence for substantial variations in the imfs of star clusters is chequered .",
    "for example , elson , fall & freeman ( 1989 ) suggested that intermediate mass stars have a flat imf in some lmc star clusters , a view that gained support from an observed range in cluster core radii consistent with expansion due to mass loss in the presence of a flat imf ( elson et al .",
    "however , in one of her last papers , elson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) present deep stis photometry of two lmc star clusters that show rather normal mfs in both cases , even though one cluster has a compact core and the other a large core of the type previously associated with a flat imf . in his review of imfs , scalo ( 1998 )",
    "suggests that significant imf variations may occur between star clusters , but finds no signs of imf variations at the level we require in m82-f .",
    "similarly , as we discussed earlier in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , neither of the nearest sscs , ngc  3603 and r136 , have abnormal intermediate mass stellar mfs .",
    "further afield we re - examined properties of ngc  1569a from new structural information published by hunter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and in ngc  1705 - 1 from size and photometric measurements taken from wfpc2 archival exposures for a new distance estimate ( tosi et al . 2001 , in prep . ) .",
    "we confirm the features discussed by sternberg ( 1998 ) for ngc  1569a which is well fit by ssp models with a slightly steeper imf with a single slope of 2.5 .",
    "the new data for ngc  1705 - 1 also confirm the results of sternberg ( 1998 ) that this cluster has a top - heavy mf ; for a @xmath12 slope , we find that the mf is truncated near 2  m@xmath4 .",
    "an indirect factor in favour of a possible top - heavy mf in m82-f is the long held suspicion that this type of situation might generally prevail in m82 .",
    "bernlhr ( 1992 ) and rieke et al . (",
    "1993 ) suggested a deficit of low mass stars from fits to the spectral energy distribution .",
    "unfortunately , the luminosity of m82 depends critically on assumptions concerning the degree of interstellar obscuration .",
    "satyapal et al . (",
    "1997 ) find that these earlier studies over - corrected for interstellar obscuration , leading to an artificially high stellar power output and the need for a top - heavy mf .",
    "doane and mathews ( 1993 ) took a different approach . in modelling the power requirements for the superwind",
    ", they needed a high supernova rate that could be naturally explained by a top - heavy imf .",
    "again more modern approaches suggest that a normal imf might be sufficient ( strickland & stevens 2000 ) .    from what we presently know",
    ", the over - luminous cluster m82-f is an anomaly even within the anomalous m82 starburst .",
    "the only comparable cases may be those seen in ngc  1275 sscs by brodie et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who presented spectroscopic evidence for top - heavy mfs .",
    "yet theory suggests that if imf variations occur , they are most likley to appear in dense star clusters , where mergers could take place and increase the mass where the stellar imf breaks in slope ( larson 1999 ) .",
    "the ssc m82-f then may be the long sought example of an evolved system with a truly peculiar mf ( see kroupa 2001 ) , and its properties and environment therefore merit further careful investigation .",
    "we thank monica tosi for providing the distance to ngc 1705 - 1 in advance of publication , and richard norris for his generous help with the starburst99 code .",
    "we also thank john mathis for his comments on this paper .",
    "both authors thank the organisers of the massive stellar clusters workshop held at the observatory of strasbourg in 1999 for a very informative and stimulating meeting where many of the ideas presented here were discussed .",
