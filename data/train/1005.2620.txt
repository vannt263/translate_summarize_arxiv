    "soon after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , it was realized that interactions of extragalactic ultrahigh energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( crs ) on the relic photons would suppress the cosmic ray flux at energies @xmath1  gev , the so - called `` gzk cutoff ''  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out subsequently  @xcite that the gzk interaction also generates a `` cosmogenic flux '' of neutrinos , through the decay of secondary charged pions .",
    "forty years later , the predicted suppression of the uhe cr flux was indeed observed by the hires  @xcite and auger  @xcite experiments .",
    "however , the cosmogenic flux of neutrinos has yet to be detected .",
    "the gzk reaction chain generating cosmogenic neutrinos is well known  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate state of the reaction @xmath2 is dominated by the @xmath3 resonance , because the neutron decay length is smaller than the nucleon mean free path on the cmb .",
    "resonant @xmath4 interactions produce twice as many neutral pions as charged pions .",
    "direct pion production via virtual meson exchange contributes only about 20% to the total cross - section , but is almost exclusively into @xmath5 .",
    "hence , @xmath4 interactions produce roughly equal number of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "gamma - rays , produced via @xmath6 decay , subsequently cascade electromagnetically on intergalactic radiation fields through @xmath7 pair production followed by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the net result is a pile up of @xmath0-rays at gev - tev energies , just below the threshold for further pair production on the diffuse optical background .",
    "meanwhile each @xmath5 decays to 3 neutrinos and a positron ; the @xmath8 readily loses its energy through inverse compton scattering on the diffuse radio background or through synchrotron radiation in intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the neutrinos carry away about 3/4 of the @xmath5 energy , therefore the energy in cosmogenic neutrinos is about 3/4 of that produced in @xmath0-rays .",
    "the normalization of the neutrino flux depends critically on the cosmological evolution of the cr sources and on their proton injection spectra  @xcite .",
    "it also depends on the assumed spatial distribution of sources ; for example , local sources in the virgo cluster  @xcite , would dominate the high energy tail of the proton spectrum .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the energy at which there is a transition from galactic to extragalactic crs as inferred from a change in the spectral slope .",
    "the `` ankle '' at @xmath9  gev seems to be a natural candidate for this transition  @xcite , but a lower energy crossover at the `` second knee '' at @xmath10  gev has also been advocated  @xcite .",
    "a fourth source of uncertainty is the chemical composition of the parent crs  if these are heavy nuclei rather than protons , then the neutrino flux is reduced  @xcite .",
    "the most up - to - date calculation  @xcite of the cosmogenic neutrino flux combines a double - fit analysis of the energy  @xcite and elongation rate  @xcite measurements to constrain the spectrum and chemical composition of uhe crs at their sources .",
    "injection models with a wide range of chemical compositions are found to be consistent with observations .",
    "the data is consistent with a proton - dominated spectrum with a small admixture of heavy nuclei , in which case the cosmogenic neutrino flux is rather similar to the all - proton model . in this case ,",
    "kilometer - scale neutrino telescopes are expected to observe of @xmath11 cosmogenic neutrino event per year .",
    "in contrast , an intermediate to heavy nuclear composition beyond the ankle , as indicated by the elongation rate vs.  energy  @xcite , can lead to a considerable suppression ( up to two orders of magnitude ) of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in comparison to the all - proton case .",
    "however , little is known about the chemical composition from just below to beyond the gzk cutoff , where the most significant contribution to cosmogenic neutrinos form uhe cr protons is expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that uncertainties in the extrapolation of the proton - air interaction  cross - section , elasticity and multiplicity of secondaries  from accelerator measurements to the high energies characteristic for air showers are large enough to undermine any definite conclusion on the chemical composition  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the constraint set by the diffuse @xmath0-ray background on all - proton models of extragalactic crs .",
    "we parametrize our ignorance of the crossover energy  which marks the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components  as a variable low energy cutoff in the proton injection rate . by fitting only to cr data above the crossover energy , taken to be between @xmath12  ev and @xmath13  ev , we determine the statistically preferred values of the spectral index @xmath0 and cosmic source density evolution index @xmath14 by a goodness - of - fit ( gof ) test of the hires data , taking into account the energy resolution of about 25% . for each model",
    "we check that the total energy density of the em cascade is below a critical value inferred from the recent measurement of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background by the fermi - lat collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we find that the allowed range of the cosmogenic neutrino flux increases with the crossover energy and can be up to an order of magnitude _ larger _ than the values presented in a recent study  @xcite .",

    "this confirms our earlier suspicion that an increasing value of the crossover energy allows a larger contribution of cosmogenic neutrinos relative to the @xmath0-rays and hence larger neutrino fluxes .",
    "figure  [ fig : nulimits ] also shows the estimated sensitivity of icecube  @xcite ( 5@xmath160 ) to neutrino fluxes in the @xmath173-@xmath161  gev ( solid )  @xcite and the @xmath161-@xmath32  gev ( dotted )  @xcite energy range after one year of observation .",
    "icecube located at the south pole is presently the largest neutrino telescope . on completion in early 2011",
    "it will consist of a km@xmath174-scale detector of transparent glacial ice , that is constantly monitored for erenkov light emission of secondary charged particles from high energy neutrino interactions .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : nulimits ] that icecube s sensitivity after one year is already sufficient to probe cosmogenic neutrino fluxes from an all - proton spectrum of extra - galactic cosmic rays .",
    "if the crossover energy exceeds @xmath175  ev , the best - fit model of the hires data is within reach of icecube .    in summary",
    "we find that while the expected range of cosmogenic neutrino fluxes in all - proton models is indeed reduced due to the constraint from the diffuse @xmath0-ray background measurements , neutrino fluxes compatible at 99% c.l with the hires and fermi - lat results can be larger than those presented in ref.@xcite by up to factor of @xmath176 for the same values of @xmath177 ev and @xmath178 . in particular the allowed cosmogenic flux is still within reach of neutrino observatories like icecube .",
    "furthermore , our results are obtained with the simple parametrization of the source spectral emission rate in eq .  ; larger neutrino fluxes might be allowed with a more general spectrum than a simple power - law .",
    "one can also turn this argument around and use observation or non - observation of cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future to provide additional constraints on the composition of cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "we have assumed here an all - proton composition for extra - galactic cosmic rays .",
    "however , as mentioned already , the chemical composition of uhe crs is rather uncertain and may well be dominated by heavy nuclei . in this case",
    "the limits on diffuse neutrino fluxes can still serve as a probe of the possible proton fraction in cosmic rays  @xcite and the limits from diffuse @xmath0-rays serve as an additional probe  @xcite .",
