    "* ) , [ oii ] line emission @xcite , and h@xmath2 line emission @xcite , have shown that the comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) density in galaxies increases rapidly as a function of redshift , rising by an order of magnitude from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "measurements of the uv luminosity of high redshift ( @xmath11 ) galaxies by @xcite and @xcite , even after correction for extinction due to dust obscuration @xcite , suggest a flattening or a decrease in this trend . consequently , the redshift range @xmath12 appears to host a change in the slope of the global sfr density , and has become the focus of several recent studies @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken a study of the global sfr within this redshift range using the h@xmath2 line emission as a probe of star formation , detected in observations with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "our target regions were chosen to lie within the groth - westphal strip @xcite .",
    "this allows us to exploit existing deep multicolour photometry and ongoing complementary ground - based spectroscopy in the analysis of the detected galaxies .",
    "the observations and data processing are described in the next section , with the resulting catalogue and measured sfr density presented in section  [ res ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath6kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "field selection was based on photometric redshift estimates for sources in the groth - westphal strip . to ensure detection of the @xmath14 emission line population ,",
    "the target fields were chosen to maximise the number of galaxies with photometric redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "six such fields lying within the groth - westphal strip were observed with camera 3 on nicmos using the f160w broadband filter and the g141 grism .",
    "the grism covers the wavelength range 1.1 to 1.9@xmath16 m with a mean dispersion of @xmath17 m pixel@xmath4 .",
    "more details of the grism properties are given in @xcite .",
    "the observations for each of the six fields consisted of 10 separate exposures with both the grism and broadband filter . the total exposure time with the f160w filter was @xmath18s , and with the g141 grism was @xmath19s for each field .",
    "the size of the direct images is 256@xmath20256 pixels with @xmath21pixel@xmath4 , so the six fields cover a total area of @xmath22 square arcminutes . for",
    "all but one of the fields the instrument was rotated by a few degrees after the first 6 pairs of exposures .",
    "this was done in an attempt to regain information on sources whose spectra might be heavily blended at the initial position angle .",
    "the data processing performed closely follows the steps outlined by @xcite .",
    "the starting point was the calibrated output from the stsci data processing pipeline , which consists of dark current removal , linearisation , bad pixel masking and cosmic - ray rejection .",
    "subsequent processing began with subtraction of a median sky frame .",
    "the median sky was constructed by combining the calibrated exposures for all the observations , producing a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) sky frame .",
    "this median was scaled before subtraction from the grism images to minimise the rms noise in each frame .",
    "the individual sky - subtracted frames for each field were then combined using a median filter after being shifted into registration using offsets derived from the associated direct images .",
    "the observations at different position angles for each field were processed independently , resulting in two direct and grism images ( at different position angles ) for five of the six fields .",
    "the nicmos - look software @xcite was used for the extraction of one - dimensional spectra from the grism images .",
    "the location and sizes for the objects in each frame were established using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the resulting source lists were input to nicmos - look for spectral extraction .",
    "this procedure identifies extraction regions in the grism images for each object based on previously calibrated transformations from the object positions in the associated direct images .",
    "the extracted spectra were wavelength and flux calibrated based on existing calibration data incorporated into nicmos - look . for some objects where the spectrum was mildly contaminated by that of a nearby object , the  deblend \" option of nicmos - look was successfully applied . for situations with strong blending , however , the spectra were not able to be reliably extracted . in the latter cases",
    "unblended spectra were often available in the grism image taken at the other position angle . in some few cases ,",
    "the spectra of objects in more crowded regions were heavily blended at both position angles , and no reliable spectra for these were obtained . for these reasons , spectra for corresponding objects in the pairs of rotated images were not combined .",
    "instead the spectra were analysed separately . in most cases",
    "the parameters for detected emission lines were measured using the spectrum extracted from the image at the orientation with the higher s / n .",
    "while the spectral range of the grism is 1.1 to @xmath23 m , we found that in many spectra , at wavelengths longer than @xmath24 m , spurious features or artifacts prevented confident emission line detections . as a result",
    "we have restricted our analysis to @xmath25 , this upper limit corresponding to h@xmath2 emission at @xmath26 m .",
    "the resulting calibrated spectra show noise levels between @xmath27jy ( rms ) over the wavelength range @xmath28 m . for a @xmath29 emission feature of average equivalent width ( @xmath30 , estimated from observed emission lines ) ,",

    "the primary cause of the discrepancy comes from the widely varying sensitivities between the different fields observed in the latter survey @xcite , which comprises a large number of less sensitive fields , and fewer deeper fields .",

    "the conclusions of earlier work showing a strong increase of global star formation rate out to redshifts of @xmath115 are clearly seen in figures  [ sfd1 ] and [ sfd2 ] .",
    "our measured value of 0.166m@xmath3yr@xmath4mpc@xmath5 for the star formation density between @xmath0 reinforces this conclusion .",
    "it also supports the conclusion that extinction corrections for uv derived estimates of sfr density are significant , and need to be of the magnitude applied by @xcite to ensure they are consistent with estimates based on emission line measurements .    our measurement of sfr density between @xmath0 is greater than that estimated from uv based data by about a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "this is similar to the factor observed in the local universe and implies that , globally speaking , there has been very little evolution in the relative extinctions between uv and h@xmath2 out to @xmath10 .",
    "this in turn implies that extinction laws constructed from observations of local systems should be valid out to redshifts of at least @xmath8 .",
    "obviously individual systems may show quite a wide variety in the amount or type of extinction , however , and in general such global trends should be applied with caution to individual cases .",
    "figure  [ sfd1 ] also emphasises that emission line measures ( o[ii ] and h@xmath2 ) of sfr density are self - consistent , as are the uv - based estimates , but that they are inconsistent with each other .",
    "this discrepancy is most likely to be explained by dust extinction .",
    "@xcite has shown that the extinction law of @xcite for starburst regions appears to be quite successful in accounting for this discrepancy .",
    "we have observed 6 fields lying within the groth - westphal strip with the nicmos g141 grism , covering a total area of @xmath1 square arcminutes .",
    "a catalogue of 163 objects has been compiled , 37 of which show emission features likely to be h@xmath2 at redshifts between @xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath2 lf in this range has been extended to luminosities a factor of two fainter than measured by @xcite .",
    "we find a value for the density of star formation between @xmath0 of 0.166m@xmath3yr@xmath4mpc@xmath5 , consistent with earlier h@xmath2 measurements .",
    "this supports the conclusions of earlier work that the global star formation rate at @xmath10 is an order of magnitude greater than locally , and that extinction corrections for uv derived estimates of sfr density are significant .",
    "additionally , our measurement of sfr density at @xmath10 is greater than the uv estimate by a similar factor to that found locally .",
    "this implies little , if any , cosmic evolution in the relative extinctions between uv and h@xmath2 out to this redshift .    the authors would like to thank the deep consortium for providing data ahead of publication for comparison with our results .",
