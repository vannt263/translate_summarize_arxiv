    "since the faddeev equations are the fundamental equations of the three - body problems their solutions are of central interest in many branches of physics .",
    "this is especially true in nuclear physics because three - body calculations serve as a distinguished tool for studying the fundamental nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "a general interaction may have a local or non - local short - range part and a long - range coulomb part .",
    "the solution of the faddeev equations with such type of potentials is not an easy job , especially the coulomb interaction and the scattering dynamics make the procedure very complicated .",
    "there exits extensive literature on the subject ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) so we restrict ourselves only to practical approaches .",
    "there are two genuinely different approaches in the practical faddeev calculations that in some extent can handle coulomb - like interactions in scattering - state problems .",
    "one of them is based on the solution of the configuration - space differential equations using the asymptotic boundary conditions @xcite . in the other approach , in order that the standard techniques could be applied , the long - range coulomb potential is screened , and then , as the screened coulomb potential goes to the unscreened one , a renormalization procedure is applied @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of the rapid development we have witnessed in the past few years , only limited solutions below or above the breakup threshold are available yet ( see , e.g. refs . @xcite .    an another approach to the nuclear three - body problem with coulomb interaction were derived along the two - potential formalism .",
    "the first , and formally exact , approach was proposed by noble @xcite . in this formulation",
    "all the coulomb interactions were included in `` free '' green s operator . thus the corresponding faddeev - noble equations are mathematically well - behaved and in the absence of coulomb interaction they fall back to the standard equations . however , the associated green s operator is not known , so this formalism is not suitable for practical calculations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to treat the three - body coulomb scattering problem via the solution of the faddeev - noble integral equations . in sec .",
    "ii below we shall derive a  three - potential  formalism .",
    "we will arrive at a set of lippmann - schwinger and faddeev equations which form a mathematically well - behaved set of integral equations . in sec .",
    "iii below we shall describe how the solution can be reached . in sec .",
    "iv below we shall compare our calculations with existing benchmark @xmath0 and @xmath1 below - breakup scattering results .",
    "it is found that in all cases excellent agreement is achieved .",
    "the method therefore appear as a promising and efficient tool for solving the coulomb three - body scattering problem , as it can be adapted to more general cases and can be extended to above - breakup coulomb scattering calculations .",
    "the noble s approach , which is , in fact , a two - potential formalism , requires the knowledge of the complete solution of the three - body coulomb problem .",
    "bencze has suggested to replace the incalculable three - body coulomb green s operator by the channel - distorted coulomb green s operator @xcite . in this section below",
    "we will follow the derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite , but instead of neglecting the intermediate range polarization potential , we will link the three - body coulomb green s operator to the channel - distorted coulomb green s operator via a lippmann  schwinger equation .",
    "thus we will arrive at a set of faddev - noble and lippmann - schwinger integral equations which are mathematically well - behaved because all the long - range interactions are kept in the green s operator .",
    "the hamiltonian of a three - body system with short - range plus coulomb two - body interactions reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the three - body kinetic energy operator , @xmath4 denotes the interaction in subsystem @xmath5 and the superscript @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for short - range and coulomb , respectively .",
    "we introduce here the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath8 is the coordinate between the pair @xmath10 and @xmath9 is the coordinate between the particle @xmath5 and the center of mass of the pair @xmath10 .",
    "thus the potential @xmath4 , the interaction between the pair @xmath10 , appears as @xmath11 .",
    "the asymptotic hamiltonian is defined as @xmath12 and the asymptotic states are the eigenstates of @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , a product of a free motion in coordinate @xmath9 and a bound - state in the two - body subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "we define two asymptotic coulomb hamiltonians as @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an auxiliary potential in coordinate @xmath9 , which is required to have the asymptotic form @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "in fact @xmath18 is an effective coulomb interaction between the center of mass of the subsystem @xmath5 ( with charge @xmath21 ) and the third particle ( with charge @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us introduce the resolvent operators : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 the operator @xmath26 is noble s channel coulomb green s operator and @xmath27 is the channel distorted coulomb green s operator introduced by bencze @xcite .",
    "these operators are connected via the following resolvent relations : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in the potential @xmath32",
    "the coulomb tail of @xmath33 is compensated by @xmath18 . as concerning the asymptotic motion",
    "@xmath32 is of short - range type , so the equation ( [ g2b ] ) is mathematically well - behaved .",
    "the scattering states @xmath34 satisfy the lippmann - schwinger equations @xmath35 in configuration - space representation the sates @xmath36 are given as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are scattering functions in the coulomb - like potential @xmath18 .    in ( [ g3b ] )",
    "the potential @xmath39 is of short - range type and @xmath40 contains all the coulomb interactions .",
    "now , all the formulas which exist in the conventional short - range three - body theory can analogously be derived , only the channel green s operator @xmath41 has to be replaced ,  la noble , by @xmath42 throughout .",
    "one can analogously perform the faddeev decomposition and for the faddeev components @xmath43 of the scattering function @xmath44 one arrives at the faddeev - noble integral equations @xmath45 \\label{feqs}\\ ] ] with a cyclic permutation in @xmath46 .",
    "the s - matrix elements of scattering processes can be obtained from the resolvent of the total hamiltonian by the reduction technique @xcite @xmath47 the subscript @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the @xmath48-th and @xmath49-th eigenstates of the corresponding subsystems , respectively .",
    "if we substitute now ( [ g3b ] ) into ( [ sm ] ) we can get , like in @xcite , the following two terms : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 we substitute again ( [ g2b ] ) into ( [ s12 ] ) and the first term yields again two further terms @xmath53 @xmath54 making use of the properties of the resolvent operators the limits can be performed and we arrive at the following , physically very plausible , result .",
    "the first term , @xmath55 , is the s - matrix of a two - body single channel scattering on the potential @xmath56 @xmath57 if @xmath56 is a pure coulomb interaction @xmath58 falls back to the s - matrix of the rutherford scattering .",
    "the second term , @xmath59 , describes a two - body multichannel scattering on the potential @xmath60 @xmath61 utilizing the properties of the faddeev components @xcite the matrix elements in ( [ s3 ] ) can be rewritten in a form which is better suited for numerical calculations @xmath62 we note , that if the coulomb interactions are absent the whole ",
    "three - potential  formalism falls back to the conventional short - range formalism .",
    "to solve operator equations in quantum mechanics one needs a suitable representation for the operators . for solving integral equations",
    "it is especially advantageous if one uses such a representation where the green s operator is simple .",
    "the free green s operator takes a very simple form in momentum representation .",
    "this is the main reason why for the solution of faddeev equations , in the presence of short - range interactions , momentum - representation techniques perform so successfully ( see for a recent review ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since the momentum representation is a continuous representation , to solve the equation one needs also some kind of discretization .    for the two - body coulomb green s operator",
    "there exists a hilbert - space basis in which its representation is very simple , it is the coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) basis . in this representation - space",
    "the coulomb green s operator can be given by simple and well - computable analytic functions @xcite .",
    "this basis is a countable set .",
    "if we represent the interaction term on a finite subset of the basis it looks like a kind of separable expansion of the potential , so the integral equation becomes an algebraic equation .",
    "the completeness of the basis ensures the convergence of the method .    in the past few years along",
    "this idea we have developed a quantum - mechanical approximation method for treating coulomb - like interactions in two - body calculations .",
    "bound- and resonant - state calculations were presented first @xcite , then the method was extended to scattering states @xcite and multichannel problems @xcite . since only the asymptotically irrelevant short range interaction",
    "is approximated , the correct ( two - body ) coulomb asymptotics is guaranteed .",
    "the corresponding computer codes for solving two - body bound- , resonant- and scattering - state problems were also published @xcite .",
    "recently the cs separable expansion approach was applied to solving the three - body bound - state problem in the presence of short - range plus repulsive coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous faddeev - noble integral equations were solved by expanding only the short - range part of the interaction in a separable form while treating the long - range part in an exact manner .",
    "the efficiency of the method was demonstrated in benchmark calculations of the three - body bound - state problem without and with coulomb interactions . in both cases",
    "the solution showed a rapid convergence , and , whenever a comparison were possible to existing results in the literature , correct predictions for the binding energies and wave functions were achieved .",
    "the method was also applied in realistic calculations @xcite .    in subsection",
    "a below we will define the basis states in two- and three - particle hilbert space . in subsection",
    "b below we recapitulate some of the most important formulas of the two - body problem ( the details are given in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , while in subsection c below the solution of the three - body coulomb scattering problem along the cs separable expansion technique is presented .",
    "the cs functions , which are the solutions of the sturm - liouville problem of hydrogenic systems @xcite , in some angular momentum state @xmath63 are defined in configuration- and momentum - space as @xmath64 ^{1/2}(2br)^{l+1}e^{-br}l_n^{2l+1}(2br )   \\label{basisr}\\ ] ] and @xmath65 respectively , and @xmath66 . here ,",

    "they form a complete set @xmath70 where @xmath71 in configuration - space representation reads @xmath72    the three - body hilbert space is a direct sum of two - body hilbert spaces .",

    "the results are given in table [ tabcps ] .",
    "we can see that the effect of the polarization potential can realy be neglected in the calculation of the @xmath1 scattering lengths .",
    "besides the number of terms in the expansion there is only one parameter in the method , the @xmath69 parameter of the basis .",
    "this should be chosen according to the range of the potential .",
    "we have found that the converged results do not depend on @xmath69 and for a wide range of reasonable values even the speed of the convergence is rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath69 . in all calculations",
    "presented the same value was applied ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "we have suggested a three - potential formalism for treating the three - body coulomb scattering problem . in absence of coulomb interactions",
    "the formalism falls back to the usual short - range formalism .",
    "according to the three - potential picture the three - body coulomb scattering starts with a two - body single channel coulomb scattering , then it goes over to a two - body multichannel scattering on the intermediate - range polarization potential , finally comes the three - body scattering due to the short - range potentials .",
    "this formalism preserves the mathematical correctness of noble s approach , and along the idea of channel distorted formalism of bencze , without neglecting important terms , gives solvable equations .",
    "these  solvable  equations are certainly too complicated for most of the numerical methods available in the literature , but the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion method can cope with them .",
    "it solves the three - body integral equations by expanding only the short - range part of the interaction in a separable form on a hilbert - space basis while treating the long - range part in an exact manner via a proper integral representation of the three - body channel distorted coulomb green s operator . as a consequence the method has good convergence properties and can in practice be made arbitrarily accurate by employing an increasing number of terms in the expansion .",
    "the usage of the coulomb - sturmian basis is essential as it allows an exact analytic representation of the two - body green s operator , and thus the contour integral for the channel distorted coulomb green s operator can be calculated also in the practice",
    ".    we have presented below - breakup calculations and got perfect agreements with existing benchmark results .",
    "we have observed a fast convergence with respect to increasing the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "using high rank expansion we got very accurate results .",
    "the quality of the convergence is practically the same in short - range and in coulomb case , coulombic calculations need only roughly @xmath142 more computer time .",
    "although the example presented here is rather simple , but not unrealistic , the method can handle more complicated potentials , as were demonstrated in bound state calculations @xcite",
    ".    certainly , the toughest problems in nonrelativistic three - body scattering are the above - breakup calculations with coulomb interactions . in this respect , the method presented here , is very promising since the equations used are mathematically well - behaved also for this case .",
    "the extension of the contour integral for above - breakup energies is straightforward .",
    "the only foreseeable problem is that the interaction volume is much bigger and one needs much higher terms in the expansion .",
    "indeed , test calculations show that for energies just a little bit above the breakup threshold with terms up to @xmath143 we can reach acceptable convergence and good agreements with benchmark results @xcite , but the method fails to reach convergence for higher energies .",
    "this indicates that the mathematical formulation is correct , but the available computing power is not sufficient .",
    "so , the method needs some more polishing and we have to think a little bit further .",
