    "knowledge of chemical composition is an important aspect in the study of materials . as a surface analytical technique , secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) ,",
    "is employed for composition profiling of materials in widely varying fields like semiconductor industry@xcite and nuclear technology@xcite .",
    "this technique has high sensitivity , surface specificity , and high dynamic range .",
    "however , it lacks quantification because of the dependence of yield of secondary ions on the composition ( matrix ) of the surface from which it is ejected.@xcite this artefact of the technique is called as matrix effect . in semiconductor industry , the number of commonly analyzed semiconductor materials is limited .",
    "hence , semiconductor research uses matrix - matched standards to quantify sims measurements.@xcite however , in a general case , like a compound multilayer or an alloy with oxidized surface , the composition is likely to vary over a vast range in the volume analyzed .",
    "such specimens would require a very large number of standards matching each of those compositions to quantify the data .",
    "hence , employing matrix - matched standards in such cases is near to impossible . the matrix effect in the intensities of xcs@xmath0 secondary ions measured with cs@xmath1 primary ions ( where x stands for an atom from the specimen and n",
    "is equal to 1 or 2 ) was shown by gao @xcite to be much lower ( in some cases , even by orders of magnitude ) than that in secondary elemental ions . however , there is considerable deviation of the composition computed from these xcs@xmath2 signals from the actual composition . in spite of developments in understanding the formation process of these species ( for example",
    ", ref @xcite ) , a gap remains in this approach in reaching complete quantification .",
    "the current work provides an incremental step in filling this gap .",
    "the xcs@xmath1 secondary ions are understood to be formed by the combination of a resputtered cs@xmath1 ion with a sputtered neutral atom from the specimen @xcite .",
    "since secondary neutrals are formed as different atomic clusters@xcite , the intensities of the cs complexes of all these clusters should be combined to enhance the quantitativeness of xcs sims .",
    "this was earlier verified with a limited number of cs complexes @xcite . however , testing this with all the cs complexes involves quantitative measurement of the intensities of the species constituting a mass spectrum and then computing the composition from those intensities .",
    "in this report , the details of this process are presented by analyzing a mass spectrum obtained from a sample of d9 steel , produced by m / s .",
    "valinox , france .",
    "d9 is the steel used in fast reactors as a construction material of core components because of its resistance to void swelling.@xcite it was selected as a material for test in this report , because it is a multi - component alloy with known composition .",
    "the implementation of the above theory involves setting up and solving systems of linear equations to know the composition of the mass spectrum .",
    "a mass spectrum is analyzed completely by considering its peaks one after another . with a peak chosen for analysis , a probable species with its mono - isotopic mass equal to the mass of that peak",
    "is first identified .",
    "this species could be mono atomic or a poly atomic cluster .",
    "its fingerprint mass spectrum has to be constructed and matched with the experimental mass spectrum .",
    "if this species contains @xmath3 number of elements , the number @xmath4 of different isotopic combinations forming this species is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , is the number of atoms of the @xmath7 element in the species and @xmath8 is the number of isotopes of the @xmath7 element . those isotopic combinations with differences in mass , which are not discernible by the resolving power of the mass analyzer , appear as a single peak in the mass spectrum .",
    "( for example , in the cluster species crfe , the combinations , @xmath9cr@xmath9fe and @xmath10cr@xmath11fe differ by a mass of 0.003u .",
    "a typical mass spectrometer with mass resolving power ( mrp ) of 500 can not resolve these two combinations since the mrp required to resolve these species is 35428 . ) hence , generally in a mass spectrum , the number of peaks corresponding to a cluster species is fewer than @xmath4 .",
    "this group of peaks from the mass spectrometer forms the fingerprint spectrum of the species after normalizing the sum of their intensities to unity .",
    "the fingerprint spectra of many species are likely to overlap with each other .",
    "the difficulty of identifying and measuring the intensities of such species in the measured spectrum depends on the number and complexity of their fingerprint spectra .",
    "the overlapping fingerprint spectra in the measured spectrum are mathematically represented by a system of linear equations .",
    "this system of equations contains one equation for every peak in the spectrum that is the resultant of overlap . for @xmath12 number of species ,",
    "overlapping with each other , constituting @xmath13 number of peaks , the system of equations is @xmath14 where @xmath15 runs from @xmath16 to @xmath13 representing the @xmath13 number of equations and @xmath17 is the measured intensity of the @xmath7 peak .",
    "@xmath18 is the intensity of the @xmath19 species , to be solved for .",
    "if the fingerprint mass spectrum of the @xmath19 species has a peak at the mass of the @xmath7 peak , @xmath20 is the intensity of that peak of the fingerprint mass spectrum .",
    "otherwise , @xmath20 is zero .",
    "@xmath21 is the noise that occurred while measuring @xmath17 , which is not known .",
    "this term was added for completeness of mathematical description .",
    "however , the above set of equations has to be solved without the knowledge of this term .",
    "the above set of equations can be represented in matrix form , after neglecting the noise term as , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 matrix containing the elements @xmath20 of eqn.[eq : equations to be solved ] .",
    "@xmath25 is the @xmath26 solution vector and @xmath27 is the @xmath28 input vector containing @xmath18 and @xmath17 of eqn.[eq : equations to be solved ] as their elements respectively .",
    "the solution providing the least squared deviation between the l.h.s . and r.h.s .",
    "of the above equation is obtained by solving the normal form of the above equation , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a @xmath31 matrix and @xmath32 is a @xmath28 vector .",
    "@xmath33 means transpose of @xmath23 .    in a few circumstances ,",
    "the solution may turn out to be erroneous ( including negative values for the intensities of a few species ) due either to the intensity of noise or to wrong choice of species or both .",
    "if the error in the solution is due to the noise in the data , the solution can be optimized by following a regularization algorithm such as the iterative algorithm discussed by gautier _ _ et al__@xcite to deconvolve instrumental broadening from sims depth profiles .",
    "the convolution matrix , solution of deconvolution and measured depth profile found in ref .",
    "@xcite are to be replaced by the isotope abundance matrix @xmath23 , solution for intensities @xmath25 and the measured mass spectrum @xmath27 respectively to regularize the solution of eqn [ eq : matrix form of equations to be solved ] . out of the two regularization conditions imposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the condition of positivity has to be retained while rejecting the condition of smoothness since the intensities need not vary smoothly from species to species .",
    "if the choice of species is wrong , the intensities of one or more species in the solution may remain to be negative even after the regularization process . in such cases ,",
    "other probable species have to be tried out and the process has to be repeated until all the correct species are identified .",
    "the concentration of an element is computed as the fraction of the number of atoms of that element in the cs complexes to the total number of atoms in all of the cs complexes excluding atoms of cs and any other element like o that might originate from the instrument,@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the concentration of the @xmath7 element , @xmath36 is the number of species containing the @xmath7 element , @xmath37 is the number of atoms of @xmath7 element in the @xmath19 such species , @xmath18 is the intensity of that ( @xmath19 ) species , @xmath3 is the total number of species identified , @xmath38 is the number of elements ( excluding cs and any other element as mentioned above ) in the @xmath39 species , @xmath40 is the number of atoms of the @xmath41 element in the @xmath42 species and @xmath43 is the intensity of the @xmath39 species .    the process of identifying and measuring the intensities of the species constituting a mass spectrum will be discussed here with a sims mass spectrum obtained from a d9 specimen .",
    "this mass spectrum was obtained using a sims ( cameca ims-4f ) system by employing a @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath46 primary ion beam for sputtering the specimen .",
    "the primary ion beam was rastered over a square area of width @xmath47 and the secondary ions were collected from the central circular area of diameter @xmath48 .",
    "the mass spectrometer was operated with a mass resolving power of @xmath49 and energy band - pass of @xmath50 for the secondary ions .",
    "eleven data points were recorded around each integral mass number to construct the peaks .",
    "a portion of the raw mass spectrum in addition to the peak values as calculated below is shown in figure [ fig : sample mass spectrum ] .",
    "the sims mass spectral peaks have the shape of the convolution of the ion - beam crossover with the exit slit of the mass analyzer .",
    "the data required for analysis are the heights of these peaks .",
    "since the data is subject to noise and the peaks have a sparse density of data , the highest raw data point of many of the peaks do not represent the apex position .",
    "hence , the spectrum was smoothened by 3-point weighted average with the central point receiving a weight of 50% and the neighboring points a weight of 25% .",
    "after smoothening , the heights of the peaks decreased proportionately and almost all of the peaks obtained a unique apex point as shown in the figure .",
    "the apex values of most of the smoothened peaks could be considered as the heights of the respective peaks .",
    "the heights of the remaining peaks were estimated manually .",
    "the peak values so estimated are shown as a bar graph in figure [ fig : full mass bargraph ] .",
    "a portion of raw mass spectrum showing extraction of peak values , scaledwidth=80.0% ]     the mass spectrum over the complete mass range , constructed using the peak values picked up from the raw mass spectrum .",
    "the names of a few of the prominent species are labeled to the corresponding peaks.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the two strongest peaks in this mass spectrum , at mass numbers 133u and 266u , are those of cs and cs@xmath51 respectively .",
    "the next highest peak is at mass number , 189u that is the mass of @xmath11fe@xmath52cs . setting up and solving eqn.[eq : matrix form of equations to be solved ] for fecs alone results in a slightly higher estimate for the intensity of fecs , to minimize the squared deviation from the measured intensity at mass number 187u that is the mass of @xmath9fe@xmath52cs as well as that of @xmath9cr@xmath52cs .",
    "the higher estimate for fecs compensates the absence of @xmath9cr@xmath52cs in the equation for mass number 187u . after including crcs in the equation ,",
    "this error in the estimate for fecs is corrected . in this manner ,",
    "the probable species contributing to all the peaks can be tried out one after the other until all the peaks are successfully characterized .",
    "the final solution is not affected by the order in which the the peaks of the mass spectrum are chosen for analysis .",
    "in the above mass spectrum , twenty four species were identified overlapping with each other spanning over the mass range from 177u to 208u , as shown in figure [ fig : solution for species around csfe ] . in this figure ,",
    "the measured spectrum is shown wider in the background and the constituent fingerprint spectra multiplied by their respective intensities are shown narrower in the foreground . with the perfect solution , the sum of the constituent spectra should be as equal to the measured spectrum as possible as shown in figure [ fig : solution for species around csfe ] .",
    "the analysis of the complete mass spectrum resulted in identification of 165 species that are tabulated in table [ table : species list ] .",
    "most of them are cs complexes that are required for the proposed quantification process .    , labelled here as  meas . ms \" , and its composition computed using",
    "_ eqn _ [ eq : normal form of equations to be solved],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    [ ! htbp ]",
    ".species identified as constituents of the complete mass spectrum shown in figure [ fig : full mass bargraph ] [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the technique of combining all xcs@xmath2 complexes ( where x is any cluster ) to compute composition is verified to advance the current status of quantification with cs complexes a step further towards better quantification by two means .",
    "one is by the inclusion of atoms in the left out cs complexes .",
    "the other is by the tendency of the disproportionalities of the intensities of xcs and xcs@xmath51 species to the concentration of x to counter each other .",
    "delineation of species constituting a mass spectrum , which is a prerequisite for this quantification technique , is aided by the mass spectral analysis described here .",
