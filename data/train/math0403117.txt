    "a striking feature of the wavelets with compact support , which are based on scaling , is that the varieties of the two kinds of bases can be well understood geometrically .",
    "for example , the collapse of the wavelet orthogonality relations , degenerating into coherent vectors , happens on a subvariety of a lower dimension .",

    "+ in quantum mechanics , one talks , for example , about coherent states in connection with wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "combinations of stationary wavefunctions from different energy eigenvalues vary periodically in time , and the question is which of the continuously varying wavefunctions one may use to expand an unknown function in without encountering overcompleteness of the basis",
    ". the methods of `` coherent states '' are methods for using these kinds of functions ( which fit some problems elegantly ) while avoiding the difficulties of overcompleteness .",
    "the term `` coherent '' applies when you succeed in avoiding those difficulties by some means or other .",
    "of course , for students who have just learned about the classic complete orthonormal basis of stationary eigenfunctions , `` coherent state '' methods at first may seem like a daring relaxation of the rules of orthogonality , so that the term seems to stand for total freedom !      wavelet theory is the art of finding a special kind of basis in hilbert space .",

    "on the two sides we present ( 1 ) a basis condition , with the basis functions indexed by a frequency variable , and giving an orthonormal basis ; and ( 2 ) a geometric notion which takes the form of a tiling , or a iterated function system ( ifs ) .",
    "our initial motivation derives from the fuglede conjecture , see @xcite : for a subset @xmath788 of @xmath789 of finite positive measure , the hilbert space @xmath790 admits an orthonormal basis of complex exponentials , i.e. , @xmath788 admits a fourier basis with some frequencies @xmath791 from @xmath789 , if and only if @xmath788 tiles @xmath789 ( in the measurable category ) where the tiling uses only a set @xmath792 of vectors in @xmath789 .",
    "if some @xmath788 has a fourier basis indexed by a set @xmath791 , we say that @xmath793 is a spectral pair .",
    "we recall from @xcite that if @xmath788 is an @xmath32-cube , then the sets @xmath791 in ( 1 ) are precisely the sets @xmath792 in ( 2 ) .",
    "this begins with work of jorgensen and steen pedersen @xcite where the admissible sets @xmath794 are characterized .",
    "later it was shown , @xcite and @xcite that the identity @xmath795 holds for all @xmath32 .",
    "the proofs are based on general fourier duality , but they do not reveal the nature of this common set @xmath794 .",
    "a complete list is known only for @xmath451 , @xmath309 , and @xmath161 , see @xcite .",
    "we then turn to the scaling ifs s built from the @xmath32-cube with a given expansive integral matrix @xmath102 .",
    "each @xmath102 gives rise to a fractal in the small , and a dual discrete iteration in the large . in a different paper @xcite , jorgensen and pedersen",
    "characterize those ifs fractal limits which admit fourier duality .",
    "the surprise is that there is a rich class of fractals that do have fourier duality , but the middle third cantor set does not .",
    "we say that an affine ifs , built on affine maps in @xmath789 defined by a given expansive integral matrix @xmath102 and a finite set of translation vectors , admits fourier duality if the set of points @xmath791 , arising from the iteration of the @xmath102-affine maps in the large , forms an orthonormal fourier basis ( onb ) for the corresponding fractal @xmath358 in the small , i.e. , for the iteration limit built using the inverse contractive maps , i.e. , iterations of the dual affine system on the inverse matrix @xmath796 . by `` fractal in the small ''",
    ", we mean the hutchinson measure @xmath358 and its compact support , see @xcite .",
    "( the best known example of this is the middle - third cantor set , and the measure @xmath358 whose distribution function is corresponding devil s staircase . )    in other words , the condition is that the complex exponentials indexed by @xmath791 form an onb for @xmath797 .",
    "such duality systems are indexed by complex hadamard matrices @xmath144 , see @xcite and @xcite ; and the duality issue is connected to the spectral theory of an associated ruelle transfer operator , see @xcite .",
    "these matrices @xmath144 are the same hadamard matrices which index a certain family of quasiperiodic spectral pairs @xmath793 studied in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". they also are used in a recent construction of terence tao @xcite of a euclidean spectral pair @xmath793 in @xmath798 for which @xmath788 does not a tile @xmath798 with any set of translation vectors @xmath792 in @xmath798 ; see also @xcite .",
    "we finally report on joint research with dorin dutkay @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where we show that all the affine ifs s , and more general limit systems from dynamics and probability theory , admit wavelet constructions , i.e. , admit orthonormal bases of wavelet functions in hilbert spaces which are constructed directly from the geometric data .",
    "a substantial part of the picture involves the construction of limit sets and limit measures , a part of geometric measure theory .",

    "<S> [ abs]abstract : some connections between operator theory and wavelet analysis : since the mid eighties , it has become clear that key tools in wavelet analysis rely crucially on operator theory . while isolated variations of wavelets , and wavelet constructions had previously been known , since haar in 1910 , it was the advent of multiresolutions , and sub - band filtering techniques which provided the tools for our ability to now easily create efficient algorithms , ready for a rich variety of applications to practical tasks . </S>",
    "<S> part of the underpinning for this development in wavelet analysis is operator theory . </S>",
    "<S> this will be presented in the lectures , and we will also point to a number of developments in operator theory which in turn derive from wavelet problems , but which are of independent interest in mathematics . some of the material will build on chapters in a new wavelet book , co - authored by the speaker and ola bratteli , see http://www.math.uiowa.edu/jorgen/0.1em .    </S>",
