    "two liquid state theories are presently available which provide an accurate description of the liquid - vapour transition of simple systems including the critical region .",
    "a first one is the so - called self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) devised initially by hye and stell @xcite and later adapted for numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the direct correlation function behaves , to a good approximation , at long range ( attractive region of the potential ) as the potential with a density and temperature dependent prefactor which is determined by imposing consistency between the energy and compressibility routes to the thermodynamics .",
    "the second approach put forward by parola and reatto @xcite , incorporates renormalisation group ideas by gradually taking into account fluctuations of longer and longer wavelengths .",
    "it is based on the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) of fluids truncated at lowest order by means of an orpa - like ( optimised random phase approximation ) ansatz ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) . both predict non - classical critical exponents @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams based on the scoza and hrt approaches have been reported for a variety of potentials ( limiting ourselves to continuum systems ) including the hard core yukawa ( hcy ) potential @xcite , the square well potential @xcite , the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xcite , the gaussian potential @xcite , ultrasoft potentials @xcite , asakura - oosawa pair potentials @xcite , girifalco potentials  @xcite , binary hard core yukawa mixtures @xcite , etc .. most of the comparisons with simulation data are so far restricted to short or medium range potentials .",
    "the aim of this article is to extend such comparisons to long range interactions . a convenient choice to do this is the hcy potential as the range can be varied from short range appropriate for modelling colloidal suspensions or protein solutions to medium range , where it mimics the familiar lj potential @xcite , to long range . for long range interactions",
    "we have considered a third approach , an optimised mean field theory ( omf ) @xcite , exact in the kac limit @xcite , which can be worked out analytically for the hcy potential ( see section 6 ) .",
    "a further advantage of the hcy potential is that the repulsive part of the potential which in scoza , hrt and omf is used as a reference potential is a hard sphere potential whose properties are accurately known @xcite .",
    "last , an approximate analytical solution ( mean spherical approximation ) is available for the hcy potential @xcite which drastically reduces the computational efforts of the solution of the scoza equations .    for short inverse screening lengths @xmath0 of the yukawa potential , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 hard sphere diameter ) , a comparison between scoza , hrt and simulation results for the liquid - vapour coexistence curve is available in @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend the domain of @xmath0 from @xmath3 ( where the hcy potential approximates the lj potential ) to @xmath4 , the infinite long range potential . with respect to simulations , in this domain",
    "the range of the yukawa potential generally exceeds the dimensions of the simulation box ( for typical system sizes of a thousand particles ) and some care is necessary to properly treat the long range of the potential .",
    "this has been done both by using periodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) and performing an ewald ( ew ) sum @xcite and by using hyperspherical b.c . @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in section [ mod ] we define the hcy interaction .",
    "section [ sim ] provides a description of the two monte carlo ( mc ) methods used to treat the long range of the yukawa interaction , ewald sum and hyperspherical method .",
    "after summarising the three considered theories , scoza , hrt and omf in section [ th ] we compare , in section [ results ] , the numerical results obtained with the different theories for the liquid - vapour coexistence curve and the thermodynamic properties along the coexistence boundary with the simulation results .",

    "we apply it to a liquid of attractive yukawa spheres .",
    "the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation in its most general formulation is a liquid - state theory that introduces in the relation between the direct correlation function @xmath50 and the pair potential @xmath51 one or more state - dependent parameters that are determined by imposing consistency between the different routes to thermodynamics leading to a partial differential equation ( pde ) for the unknown parameter(s ) .",
    "the scoza originally grew out of the semi - analytic solution of the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) for hcy potentials  @xcite and it is this scoza formulation that is considered in the present work .",

    "the consistency requirement leads to a pde of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the reduced ( with respect to the ideal gas ) dimensionless isothermal compressibility given by the compressibility route and @xmath59 is the excess ( over ideal gas ) internal energy per volume provided by the energy route , i.e. @xmath60 . once @xmath61 is expressed in terms of the excess internal energy the pde  eq.([consist ] ) can be transformed into a pde for @xmath59 @xmath62 for the general case of an arbitrary attractive tail of the pair interaction the determination of @xmath63 must be done fully numerically  @xcite and requires an enormous amount of computational cost .",
    "however , this procedure is not necessary for the fluid considered here : for certain pair potentials , like the hard - core yukawa potential or hard - core potentials with linear combinations of yukawa and exponential tails - so called sogami - ise fluids , the coefficient @xmath63 can be obtained semi - analytically due to the availability of the semi - analytic msa solution for these potentials .",
    "details of the determination of @xmath63 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and  @xcite . while the former formulation of scoza in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the laplace transformation route for solving the underlying msa for hard - core yukawa fluids , we have used in the present work the reformulation described in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite which is based on the wertheim - baxter factorisation method for the solution of the msa .",
    "while both solution methods are equivalent for the potential considered here , the wertheim - baxter factorisation method is more flexible and allows a broader applicability of the scoza  @xcite .",
    "the pde is a quasilinear diffusion equation that has been solved numerically via an implicit finite - difference algorithm in the region @xmath64\\times[0,1]$ ] with suitable initial and boundary conditions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "we have chosen a density and temperature grid spacing of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "up to now scoza has been applied to a number of discrete  @xcite and continuum systems  @xcite and the results showed - when compared with computer simulations - that the theory yields very accurate predictions for the thermodynamic and structural properties throughout the temperature - density plane , even near the phase coexistence and in the critical region .",
    "indeed , scoza is one of very few liquid state theories that do not show serious problems in the critical region and even exhibit some form of scaling with non - classical , partly ising - like critical exponents @xcite .      in hrt",
    "the pair potential @xmath51 is divided into a repulsive reference potential part @xmath67 and a longer - ranged attractive part @xmath68 . in the present case",
    "the reference system is the hard - sphere fluid , whose thermodynamics and correlations are accurately described by the carnahan - starling equation of state  @xcite and the verlet - weis parameterisation of the two - body radial distribution function  @xcite .",
    "the hrt differs from the conventional liquid state approaches in the way the attractive perturbation is dealt with : in order to take into account the effect of fluctuations , @xmath68 is introduced gradually via a sequence of @xmath69 systems whose interaction potential @xmath70 results from the sum of @xmath71 and a perturbation @xmath72 .",
    "the latter term is defined by its fourier transform @xmath73 which coincides with @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and is identically vanishing for @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath69 evolves from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , the interaction @xmath79 goes from the reference part @xmath67 to the full potential @xmath51 . in other words the parameter @xmath69 plays the role of an infrared cutoff whose effect consists in depressing fluctuations on length scales larger than @xmath80 : the critical fluctuations are recovered only in the limit @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding evolution of thermodynamics and correlations of increasing order can be determined via perturbation theory and is described by an exact hierarchy of integro - differential equations . as mentioned above close to a critical point and at large length scales , this hierarchy becomes equivalent to a formulation of the momentum - space renormalisation group  @xcite .",
    "unlike current liquid - state theories hrt preserves the correct convexity of the free energy also below the critical temperature , producing flat isotherms in the coexistence region which correspond to infinite compressibility and constant chemical potential .",
    "the first equation of the hierarchy gives the evolution of the helmholtz free energy @xmath82 of the partially interacting system in terms of its two - body direct correlation function in momentum space @xmath83 and the full perturbation @xmath74 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",

    "indeed , they represent the free energy and direct correlation function of the fully interacting fluid as given by a treatment such that the fourier components of the interaction with wavelengths larger than @xmath80 are not really disregarded , but approximately taken into account by mean - field theory . in the @xmath81",
    "limit the modified quantities coincide with the physical ones , once the fluctuations have been fully included .",
    "for @xmath77 the definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ amod ] ) and ( [ cmod ] ) reduce , instead , to the well - known mean - field expressions of the free energy and direct correlation function .",
    "a simple approximation scheme consists in truncating the hierarchy at the first equation , supplementing it with a suitable closure relation based on some ansatz for @xmath87 . as in previous applications",
    ", our form of @xmath87 has been inspired by liquid - state theories , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the fourier transform of the direct correlation function of the hard - sphere fluid , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 are _ a priori _ unknown functions of the thermodynamic state and of q. the function @xmath96 is determined by the core condition , i.e. , the requirement that the radial distribution function @xmath97 is vanishing for every @xmath69 whenever the interparticle separation is less than the hard - sphere diameter @xmath2 . via eq .",

    "the compressibility rule  ( [ sum ] ) plays a fundamental role .",
    "in fact , when @xmath95 in  eq.([closure ] ) is determined via  eq.([sum ] ) and the resulting expression for @xmath87 is used in  eq.([hrteq ] ) , one obtains a partial differential equation for @xmath86 which reads @xmath100 \\ , , \\label{hrtclos}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 \\varphi(k ) \\ , .",

    "the spacing of the density grid is @xmath108 , consequently the error in the determination of the coexistence densities is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "concerning the boundary conditions : for low density the system behaves as an ideal gas while at @xmath109 we assumed the validity of the standard orpa approximation .",
    "two remarks are worth mentioning : first , eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) assumes that the fluid direct correlation function depends linearly on the perturbation @xmath110 .",
    "this ansatz is especially appropriate when the perturbation range is much longer than that of the reference part of the interaction , i.e. longer than the particle size .",
    "the second remark relates to the implementation of the core condition : the inverse fourier transform of the function @xmath96 has been expanded in a series of legendre polynomials for @xmath111 and the series has been truncated after a finite number of terms ( typically five ) .",
    "the evolution equations for the expansion coefficients were then determined by differentiating with respect to @xmath69 the integral equation for @xmath98 , i.e. the core condition , and subsequently projecting it on the polynomials used in the expansion . however ,",
    "the resulting equations are coupled to the evolution equation  [ hrteq ] for the free energy , and this makes them difficult to handle . therefore , as described in detail in [ 21 , 22 ] , in the derivative of @xmath98 with respect to q the long - wavelength contributions containing the isothermal compressibility of the q - system were disregarded .",
    "physically this amounts to a decoupling of the short- and the long - range evolutions of the correlations .",
    "this approximation , as well as the previous one , are fully justified for long - range perturbations , where the short- and the long - range parts of the correlations are mainly affected by the reference and the perturbation terms respectively , but become more problematic for short - range interactions where the interplay between excluded - volume and cohesion effects is much stronger . however , this effect does not concern the present study",
    ".      we consider , quite generally , a fluid of identical hard spheres of diameter @xmath2 with additional isotropic pair interaction @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath51 is an arbitrary function of @xmath113 for @xmath114 , one can assume that @xmath51 has been regularised in the core in such a way that its fourier transform @xmath115 is a well behaved function of @xmath116 and that @xmath117 is a finite quantity .    at equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath118 and chemical potential @xmath119 ( grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble )",
    "the pressure @xmath120 of the fluid is a convex function of @xmath121 ( at fixed @xmath118 ) @xcite even before the thermodynamic limit has been taken @xcite . as a consequence @xmath122 is continuous ,",
