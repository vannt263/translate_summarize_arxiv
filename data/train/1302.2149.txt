    "galaxy morphologies do not follow the classical hubble classification .",

    "observationally , there are hints that the @xcite @xmath9-parameter of clumpy disks is @xmath10 , suggesting that clumps form because of gravitational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the resolution achieved by these studies , the masses of the clumps are quite high ( @xmath11 ) , with the radii between 0.5 and a few kpc .",

    "the average surface density of sfr becomes a direct measure of the gas surface density present in the galaxy @xcite . under the assumption of a rotating and marginally unstable ( @xmath12 ) disk ,",
    "@xcite argued that the mass of the more massive clumps which can form increases for higher disk surface density .",
    "this finding can , indeed , explain why when the properties of high @xmath5 clumps are compared to local star - forming regions , they appear to follow the same physical relations as the latter but at much higher scales of sfr , luminosity , total stellar mass , etc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a comparison study of the clump properties in clump clusters , chains and young spirals shows that the former may evolve into spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , theoretical works and simulations show that clumps form in gravitationally unstable , highly turbulent disks .",
    "these clumps are expected to migrate toward the centre of the system because of dynamical friction and tidal torques in about 10 times the dynamical time , i.e. a total time range of 0.51 gyr . in the centre clumps coalesce and slowly build up the bulge and the thick disk component @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario works if clumps survive long enough to reach the centre of the galaxy . in simulations and analytical studies , different initial conditions and assumptions",
    "lead to opposite fates of the clumps , i.e. they can be rapidly disrupted by stellar feedback @xcite , or survive to the initial gas loss for several dynamical times , so they could spiral inward @xcite .",
    "streams of material coming from dissolving clumps could still migrate toward the centre , but the bulge formation mechanism would be more inefficient @xcite .    in spite of the progress made in understanding how galaxies have evolved from the time at which the cosmic sfr peaked ( @xmath13 ) to the current decline , it is still challenging to get a complete census of the whole process .",
    "the major obstacles are the limited resolution and sensitivity , which create a bias toward galaxies with extreme sfrs and physical conditions not observed in the local universe .",
    "recently , in order to study fainter galaxies with lower sfrs , researchers have focused their attention to galaxies which have been magnified by a strong gravitational lens , i.e. galaxy cluster potential well .",

    "the most important outcome of this high - resolution analysis is that in spite of the extreme conditions under which clumps and star formation happens in these galaxies , the underlying physical process which governs star formation is the same as observed in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the system is located behind the galaxy cluster ( hereafter macs j1149 ) , and thanks to the gravitational magnification , allows us to resolve spatial scales down to @xmath15 pc . according to @xcite , sp1149 has a luminosity comparable to a local @xmath6 galaxy @xcite , and is about 1 mag fainter than previously studied unlensed spirals at similar redshifts .",
    "we will try to constrain how star formation is proceeding in the galaxy , by means of the clump analysis .",
    "the current sfr of sp1149 is not extreme if compared to local spirals ( in the range 16 @xmath16/yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported clear signs of a rotationally supported disk and an increasing radial metallicity gradient toward the centre .",
    "therefore , sp1149 is a potential target for investigating the transition phase that extremely star - forming galaxies have experienced when evolving into modern late type systems .",
    "the paper is organised as follow . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the dataset and details of the photometric analysis .",
    "these data will be used to derive clump properties , e.g. age , mass , extinctions , effective radii , in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce some new data , together with literature ones , which will be used as a comparative sample , both at high @xmath5 and in the local universe .",
    "section 5 presents the analysis of the clump properties , in the context of local cluster complexes but also high @xmath5 clumps .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss the formation and fate of sp1149 clumps , evidence for the bulge formation and the potential rate of metal - rich globular cluster progenitors .",
    "a discussion and summary will follow in the final section .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters : h@xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",

    "four multiple images of have been identified in the galaxy cluster frame of macsj1149 . in this work",
    "we will focus on the tangential image a1.3 from @xcite and showed here in figure  [ image ] .",
    "the particular geometry of the gravitational potential causes this image of to be almost equally lensed in both linear directions , thus avoiding the distortion effects that plague many other lensed galaxies . using the lens model derived by @xcite",
    ", we measured a linear magnification in the centre of the galaxy is 2.7@xmath223.1 ( almost symmetric ) at a position angle of 37 degrees ( * ? ? ?",
    "* livermore et al in prep . ) .",
    "therefore , we assume a uniform magnification across the galaxy of @xmath23 because the system is distant enough from the @xmath24 critical line to not be affected by strong magnification gradients .",
    "the uncertainties on the magnification as function of the position in the galaxy are smaller than the uncertainties associated to the computed galaxy cluster magnification map , i.e. @xmath25 % . because the fluxes of each clump are scaled by the same magnification factor , this uncertainty will not change the shape of the clump sed but only the derived mass .",
    "the galaxy cluster macsj1149 has been included among the 25 targets of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( _ clash _ ) , an ongoing _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) multi - cycle treasury program ( 12065 , pi : marc postman ) .",

    "[ tbl-1a ] and [ tbl-1b ] , we summarise the filters used in this analysis ( 11 out of 17 ) , the aperture correction applied , and the photometric catalogue of the extracted cluster complexes in the abmag system .    the clash  team has released two reduced datasets of macsj1149 with different final pixel scale resolutions , 0.03/px and 0.065``/px .",
    "the images have all been rescaled to the same pixel scale , aligned , and registered ( see * ? ? ? * for more information ) . to carry out our analysis we use the set with 0.065''/px scale resolution .",
    "the latter is a good compromise between the finer resolution of the acs / wfc and wfc3/uvis cameras ( 0.05 and 0.04/px , respectively ) and the worse scale sampling of the wfc3/ir ( 0.13/px ) .    to perform the photometric analysis we selected only the filters where the signal  to  noise ( s / n ) was good enough to detect the clumps ( e.g. in the f225w , f275w , and f336w filters the galaxy is barely detected ,",
    "so they are excluded from the analysis ) and the filter width was such that it carried new information ( e.g. the f625w has been excluded because it overlaps with the f555w , f606w , and f775w transmission ) .",
    "of each large frame , we cut out a 13@xmath2213 arcsec@xmath28 image centred on the spiral .",
    "the acs frames have then been combined with the iraf task imcombine , using the function sum to improve the s / n of the sources .",
    "this combined frame has only been used to identify the clumps by eye . to do aperture photometry",
    ", we used a radius of 3 px ( @xmath29 ) and a sky annulus 1 px wide located at a distance of 4 px .",
    "the aperture radius has been chosen large enough to contain the stellar fwhm of the ir camera . the combined frame",
    "used for clump detection and the aperture size applied to do photometry is shown in figure  [ pos ] .    as we will discuss in section  [ ssc ] ,",
    "some of the clumps are extended , others unresolved or barely resolved . to compensate for the missing flux caused by the use of a finite aperture radius we used unsaturated stars detected in each initial macsj1149 frame to estimate the aperture correction . in the case of extended sources",
    "this correction factor is a lower limit to the fraction of missed flux .",
    "in other words , we have only corrected for the missing flux assuming a stellar psf .",
    "the photometry has also been corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .    tables  [ tbl-1a ] and [ tbl-1b ] contain the final photometric catalogue of the 31 clumps .",
    "these fluxes have been scaled down by the factor @xmath30 to take into account the magnification of the lens .",

    "<S> we analyse the clump population of the spiral galaxy sp1149 at redshift 1.5 . </S>",
    "<S> located behind the galaxy cluster macs j1149.5 + 2223 , sp1149 has been significantly magnified allowing us to study the galaxy on physical scales down to @xmath0 pc . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy cluster frame is among the targets of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble ( _ clash _ ) , an ongoing _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) multi - cycle treasury program . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the publicly available multi - band imaging dataset to reconstruct the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the clumps in sp1149 , and derive , by means of stellar evolutionary models , their physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we found that 40 % of the clumps observed in sp1149 are older than 30 myr and can be as old as 300 myr . </S>",
    "<S> these are also the more massive ( luminous ) clumps in the galaxy . among the complexes in the local reference sample , </S>",
    "<S> the star - forming knots in luminous blue compact galaxies could be considered progenitor analogs of these long - lived clumps . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 60 % of clumps have colors comparable to local cluster complexes , suggesting a similar young age . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the sp1149 clumps follow the @xmath1 relation similar to local cluster complexes , suggesting similar formation mechanisms although they may have different initial conditions ( e.g. higher gas surface densities ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the galaxy is experiencing a slow decline in star formation rate and a likely transitional phase toward a more quiescent star - formation mode . </S>",
    "<S> the older clumps have survived between 6 and 20 dynamical times and are all located at projected distances smaller than 4 kpc from the centre . </S>",
    "<S> their current location suggests migration toward the centre and the possibility to be the building blocks of the bulge . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical timescale of the younger clumps are significantly shorter , meaning that they are quite close to their birthplace . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the clumps of sp 1149 may account for the expected metal - rich globular cluster population usually associated with the bulge and thick disk components of local spirals . </S>"
