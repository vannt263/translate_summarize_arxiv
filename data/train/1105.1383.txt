    "the ` guitar fingering problem ' is , less colloquially , the finding of an optimal assignment of pitches to strings and frets .",
    "previous work on this problem @xcite takes as fixed three things : the composition , the musical key , and the guitar s tuning . from these , a fingering is found that demands little technical dexterity , or that at least obeys the mechanical limitations of the instrument .",
    "we generalize this by fixing only the composition , and then simultaneously optimizing over three aspects : the fingering , the tuning , and the key ( transposing from , say , g major to a major ) .",
    "historical motivation for exploring nonstandard tunings is found in the work of guitarists such as muddy waters , chuck berry , and keith richards  @xcite , john lennon  @xcite , and especially michael hedges  @xcite .",
    "the search for optimality is also driven by the observation that some genres such as blues or gypsy jazz @xcite typically use only one or two fingers at a time .",
    "strong constraints are thus critical for reconstructing fingering from audio - only recordings .",
    "a * pitch * is the fundamental frequency of a sound with a harmonic spectrum , such as that played by many musical instruments .",
    "pitch is measured in log hz .",
    "the logarithm conveniently lets us define an * interval * , such as an octave or semitone , as a _ ratio _ of pitches ( 2:1 or @xmath0{2}$]:1 , respectively ) .",
    "\\subset \\mathbb{r}$ ] . ]",
    "pitch is continuous , but as we are discussing fretted stringed instruments , we temper the octave into twelve equal semitones ( equal temperament ) . then we represent an interval as not a ratio but an integer counting the number of semitones between two pitches .",
    "thus , in the familiar way , 12 represents an octave , 7 a perfect fifth , 1 a semitone .",
    "if we fix a reference pitch , then we can similarly represent any _ pitch _ as an integer , namely the integer representing the interval from the reference to the pitch in question . in the context of a particular tuning of an instrument ,",
    "the reference pitch is often that of the lowest string , played unfretted ( see below ) .",
    "a * string * is defined by what it can do : sound a pitch from a contiguous range bounded at both ends by the fingerboard s finite length . at any given moment",
    ", a string sounds either no pitch or exactly one pitch .",
    "when a string sounds its lowest pitch , we call it unfretted or * open*.    an * instrument * means a fretted multi - string musical instrument such as a guitar , arpeggione , or lute .",
    "we concentrate on the six - string guitar because it is widely played , often retuned , and used in many musical styles .",
    "a * fret * constrains a string s playable pitches to a discrete subset .",
    "we assume that adjacent frets are one semitone apart , and that all strings have the same frets ( a rectangular fingerboard ) .",
    "we assume that strings are fretted by the four fingers of the left hand ( not the thumb , although some advanced styles permit the thumb to fret the lowest string ) .",
    "one finger can fret several adjacent strings .    an instrument s * tuning * is the set of pitches of its open strings . a",
    "* tuning vector * is that set , sorted by rising pitch .",
    "thus , the number of strings determines the size of the tuning vector . *",
    "retuning * means a change of tuning , whether or not this is to or from an instrument s standard tuning ( scordatura ) .",
    "we ignore unusual ` out of order ' tunings such as congolese mi - compos , standard tuning with the d string up an octave  @xcite .",
    "we also ignore tunings where several strings share the same pitch , such as variations on lou reed s ` ostrich ' ( d - d - d - d - d - d ) .",
    "in particular , we assume that as one moves across the fingerboard , open pitch strictly rises .",
    "common examples for the guitar include standard tuning ( e - a - d - g - b - e@xmath1 ) and open  g ( d - g - d - g - b - d@xmath1 ) ; hundreds more exist  @xcite .- a@xmath2-d@xmath3-g@xmath3-b@xmath3-e@xmath4 )  @xcite , because the former is more legible in the few octaves used by the guitar .",
    "we also spell such vectors with hyphen - separated pitch names , instead of with mathematically orthodox tuple notation . ]",
    "a * chord * is a set of pitches sounding simultaneously .",
    "( these pitches need not have begun simultaneously . )",
    "we abuse the term s traditional meaning by letting it contain fewer than three pitches , what musicians call an interval or a unison .",
    "this is because traditional harmonic analysis concerns us less than the constraints on which strings can play which pitches .",
    "a * composition * is a finite sequence of chords of finite duration .",
    "we concentrate our attention on the left hand , ignoring right - hand techniques like plucking and damping .",
    "a * fingering * for a composition is a mapping from its pitches to ( string , fret ) pairs .",
    "a * pitch value * is a pitch constrained to an integer ( semitone ) value . a * pitch class * is one of the twelve traditional names c , c@xmath5 , d , ... , b. a * musical key * , such as e major , is a set of seven distinct pitch classes that forms a major or minor scale .",
    "one of these pitch classes is special , called the * tonic*. a pitch s * scale position * is its distance above the next lowest tonic pitch of a musical key , measured in semitones .",
    "thus a scale position must lie in @xmath6 .",
    "consider a tuning vector @xmath7 .",
    "because we start counting from the lowest string , the @xmath8 are increasing .",
    "we then define the corresponding * length-5 tuning vector * as @xmath9 because no two open strings share a pitch , the @xmath8 are _ strictly _ increasing : @xmath10 . thus each @xmath11 . for convenience of summation in eqs .  , and , we also define @xmath12 .",
    "one 5-vector ( of intervals ) corresponds to many 6-vectors ( of pitches ) .",
    "for example , ( 5,5,5,4,5 ) , abbreviated as 55545 , corresponds to both e - a - d - g - b - e@xmath1 and d - g - c - f - a - d@xmath1 ) .",
    "converting a 5-vector to a 6-vector , by choosing a pitch for the lowest string , is what we call augmenting or * evaluating * a 5-vector at a pitch .",
    "for example , evaluating 75545 at d yields drop - d tuning , d - a - d - g - b - e@xmath1 .    for",
    "a given tuning , let @xmath13 be the pitch sounded by string @xmath14 when fingered at fret @xmath15 , for @xmath14 from 1 to 6 , for @xmath15 from 0 to 24 ( lowest pitch to highest , in both cases ) . as a reference for this tuning , set @xmath16 .    since frets are spaced one semitone apart , @xmath17    combining these yields the string changing equation @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "this equation characterizes the relationship between four concepts : pitch value @xmath21 , string @xmath14 , fret @xmath15 , and tuning vector @xmath22 .",
    "this notation derives from work by allen , formalized by gilles and jennings  @xcite .",
    "for notational convenience , we call @xmath23 a * guitar position * , or just a position . as before , @xmath19 indicates string , and @xmath20 indicates fret .",
    "this lets us define a * tone * as an ordered triple : ( pitch value , scale position , guitar position ) .",
    "given a particular tuning and musical key , a guitar can play some tones but not others .",
    "for example , in standard tuning in e major , playing the lowest open string yields the tone ( 0 ,  0 ,  ( 1 ,  0 ) ) : pitch value  0 , scale position  0 , ( string  1 , fret  0 ) .",
    "but the tone ( 0 ,  0 ,  ( 2 ,  0 ) ) can not be played : string  2 , fret  0 has a different pitch value and scale position than string  1 , fret  0 . playing the highest open string in the context of c major yields the tone ( 24 ,  4 ,  ( 6 ,  0 ) ) : 24 semitones higher , 4 above c , sixth string , zeroth fret .",
    "if we momentarily relax some constraints on pitch value , scale position , and the two elements of guitar position , then @xmath24 describes the set of all possible tones . as @xmath25 , since there is no confusion with the latter s other meanings in number theory .",
    "] we still constrain scale position to lie in @xmath26 .",
    "if vector addition is componentwise , and ( real ) scalar multiplication is multiplication on each element of the vector , then this set is not quite a vector space over the field @xmath27 , as it lacks closure under scalar multiplication . for example , @xmath28 is in @xmath29 , but not @xmath30 . to get a vector space",
    ", we must extend the @xmath31 s to @xmath27 s . instead of the field @xmath27 , leaving the space as only a module over @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. , _ an abelian group .",
    "this is too limited for our purposes .",
    "] this demands continuous values for not only pitch , scale position , and fret number , but also for string number .",
    "( imagine a haken continuum  @xcite programmed to change pitch along _ both _ horizontal axes . )",
    "then @xmath25 becomes @xmath27 ` mod 12 . '",
    "this is in fact a vector space over @xmath27 .",
    "intuitively , its vectors are directions on a clock face and its scalars are the lengths of the clock s hands . to prove this rigorously , we define @xmath32 as the set of length-1 vectors whose elements lie in @xmath26 . for vectors @xmath33 , [ y ] \\in \\mathbb{r}_{12}$ ] ,",
    "we define @xmath33 + [ y ] = [ ( x+y ) - 12 \\lfloor \\frac{x+y}{12 } \\rfloor ] $ ] . for scalars @xmath34 , we define multiplication as @xmath35 = [ rx - 12 \\lfloor \\frac{rx}{12 } \\rfloor ] $ ] .",
    "the proofs of commutativity , distributivity , _ etc .",
    ", _ are then elementary .    as @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath36 are themselves vector spaces over @xmath27 ( the usual euclidean ones ) , we then conclude that the set @xmath37 of all tones is one too , namely the direct sum @xmath38 .",
    "as the set of all tones is a vector space , we can imagine the subset of _ playable _ tones as a space within which we can move .",
    "it then becomes useful to informally discuss ` directions of motion ' or ` orthogonal vectors of tone movement . ' also , instead of moving from one tone to another , we can equivalently describe one playable tone ` changing ' to another , as a side effect of changing guitar tuning , musical key , string , or fret .",
    "the directions then correspond to the changing of one of the three elements of a tone ( pitch value , scale position , or guitar position ) .",
    "insofar as these three directions have an obvious unit value , we can even call these orthogonal vectors orthonormal .      given a particular guitar tuning and a particular musical key",
    ", the subset @xmath39 of playable tones has a certain structure relative to @xmath37 , the vector space of all possible tones .",
    "we can imagine @xmath39 as a surface or manifold within @xmath37 . to motivate a derivation of its precise structure ,",
    "consider the example of tuning in fourths , e - a - d - g - c - f@xmath1 ( 55555 evaluated at e ) , with the key of a major .",
    "to intuit the local structure of @xmath39 , take a note somewhere in the middle of the fingerboard , such as ( 3 , 4 ) : d string , fourth fret , sounding f@xmath5 .",
    "since f@xmath5 is 9 semitones above a , the corresponding tone in @xmath39 is ( f@xmath5 ,  9 ,  ( 3 ,  4 ) ) . to find nearby members of @xmath39 ,",
    "change this tone elementwise :    1 .",
    "if we change pitch value from f@xmath5 to g , then 9 becomes 10 , and ( 3 , 4 ) becomes ( 3 , 5 ) .",
    "more generally , as the finger moves along the string , pitch value , scale position , and fret number move along a euclidean line .",
    "if we change the scale position from 9 to 10 , the same thing happens .",
    "if we change fret number from 4 to 5 , the same thing happens .",
    "4 .   if we change string from d to g , ( 3 , 4 ) to ( 4 , 4 ) , then f@xmath5 becomes b and 9 becomes @xmath40 .",
    "more generally , as the finger moves transversely across the strings , pitch value and scale position ( mod 12 ) move along a euclidean line , while fret value remains constant .    within this particular tuning and musical key , scale position can be derived from pitch value : a playable tone with pitch value @xmath41 must have scale position @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the scale position of pitch value 0 , the lowest pitch of the lowest string .",
    "this removes one dimension from @xmath39 , leaving at most three . but",
    "@xmath39 also needs at _ least _ three dimensions :    * from ( 1 ) , pitch value is independent of string number . * from ( 1 ) , fret number is independent of string number . * from ( 4 ) , fret number is independent of pitch value .",
    "thus a local neighborhood ( a topology ) in @xmath39 has _",
    "exactly _ three dimensions , or three independent vectors .",
    "we can not call the vectors suggested by ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) orthogonal , because their dot product may be nonzero . for example , starting again from ( f@xmath5 ,  9 ,  ( 3 ,  4 ) ) , moving in ` direction ' ( 1 ) yields ( g ,  10 ,  ( 3 ,  5 ) ) ; in direction ( 4 ) yields ( b ,  2 ,  ( 4 ,  4 ) ) . computing the dot product , @xmath44 since @xmath39 might not contain the origin",
    ", it might not be a proper vector subspace of @xmath37 .",
    "this dimensionality argument still suggests that @xmath39 looks locally like a 3-dimensional affine subspace of @xmath37 .",
    "but appearances deceive : sections [ manifold ] and [ ominimal ] disprove this and find more fitting structures for @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the set of playable tones in @xmath37 , using the tuning vector 55555 from the example in section [ ortho ] .",
    "viewed discretely , each element of @xmath39 corresponds to one guitar position . since a guitar position can take on 6 string values and 25 fret values , @xmath45 .",
    "viewed continuously , on the other hand , the finite fingerboard imposes bounds on @xmath39 .",
    "guitar position must lie in @xmath46 \\times [ 0,24]$ ] .",
    "this in turn bounds pitch values . at the bottom ,",
    "position ( 1 ,  0 ) has pitch value 0 by definition , while at the top , eq .",
    "says that position ( 6 ,  24 ) has pitch value @xmath47 .",
    "these bounds prevent @xmath39 from being closed under either linear or affine combinations , so @xmath39 can be neither a subspace nor an affine subspace of @xmath37 .",
    "but when we induce a topology on @xmath39 from the usual topology on @xmath48 , the one whose basis is the set of open spheres , then @xmath39 becomes a manifold within @xmath37 , a manifold with corners  @xcite .",
    "`` any closed rectangle in @xmath49 is a smooth @xmath50-manifold with corners ''  @xcite .",
    "the closed rectangle here comes from the bounds themselves , @xmath46 \\times [ 0,24 ] \\times [ 0,49]$ ] . also , since each string has comfortably more than 12 frets , each string s set of pitches spans more than an octave .",
    "thus @xmath39 includes all possible values of scale position .",
    "having jumped from linear algebra to topology , we can now dispense with the requirement of constant - interval tunings such as 44444 or 55555 .",
    "when the interval between adjacent strings is nonconstant , @xmath39 merely relaxes from a manifold to a piecewise linear ( pl ) manifold  @xcite .",
    "has fewer than four dimensions , it escapes milnor s counterexample to hauptvermutung  @xcite . ]",
    "recall that the set of tones @xmath37 is @xmath38 . consider @xmath39 as a subset of not @xmath37 but rather the ` bigger ' space @xmath51 .",
    "relabel as @xmath52 the scalars that we have called pitch value , scale position , string , and fret .",
    "then we can define @xmath39 in terms of solution sets to inequalities that are in the form of polynomials in the @xmath53 .",
    "we begin with the bounds on @xmath39 , expressed as two inequalities each for pitch value , scale position , string , and fret : @xmath54 ( here , @xmath55 abbreviates the conjunction of the equation @xmath56 and the inequality @xmath57 . )",
    "another boolean expression specifies the correspondences between pitch value @xmath58 and ( string , fret ) pair @xmath59 found in eq .",
    ": @xmath60 the conjunction of all these is a finite boolean combination of sets of the forms @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where all the @xmath15 s and @xmath63 s are polynomials ( all of degree 1 , incidentally ) . hence",
    ", @xmath39 is a semialgebraic set .    of the many interesting corollaries that follow from this result , we note particularly that the set @xmath64 of all sets of playable tones  all possible @xmath39 s , from all tunings , in all musical keys ",
    "forms an o - minimal structure on @xmath27 .",
    "this means that @xmath64 is ` nice : ' it is closed under common operations such as finite unions and intersections , complements , and ( via the tarski - seidenberg theorem ) projection to lower dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the subset of @xmath39 that lies on one string has a powerful structural description , namely a line .",
    "if we call a tone s fret position @xmath41 , the pitch value of the tone s open string @xmath65 , and the tone s pitch value @xmath66 , then the line @xmath67 relates @xmath41  to  @xmath66 within @xmath39 , with the slope @xmath68 being 1 .",
    "conjoining six of these equations , one per string , yields a vector equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the vector of fret positions , @xmath71 is the guitar s tuning , and @xmath72 is the resulting vector of pitch values .",
    "we call eq .   the * pitch - position relation*. particularly when written as @xmath73 , it describes the shape of @xmath39 for any tuning @xmath71 . more concretely ,",
    "if we re - tune from @xmath74 to @xmath75 but wish to leave pitches unchanged , then eq .   shows how the fingering s fret positions must compensate by changing from @xmath76 to @xmath77 : @xmath78 combining these and solving for @xmath77 , the new fret positions are @xmath79 .    in cryptography , such a difference of vectors , @xmath80 , is called a caesar shift or caesar cipher .",
    "thus , we call this difference a * cipher*. a cipher ` encodes ' how a change of tuning causes a change of fingering . section [ ciphers ] treats this in detail .",
    "recall that a local neighborhood in @xmath39 has three dimensions .",
    "we can describe these three dimensions functionally :    * * transformation * means that a tone preserves its pitch value , but changes scale position . *",
    "* translation * means that a tone preserves its scale position , but changes pitch value . * * isomerization * means that a tone preserves both pitch value and scale position , but changes guitar position .    one more term will become useful : * re - keying * means a change of musical key ( _ e.g. , _ from e major to d major ) .      three common applications arise when practically applying these directions .    *",
    "_ transformation usually implies retuning _ ( with a compensating fret change , to leave pitch unchanged ) .",
    "but transformation could also mean that no retuning happened : instead , the musical key changed , landing the same pitch on a different scale position .",
    "transformation could even mean both retuning and re - keying .",
    "* _ translation implies re - keying .",
    "_ for example , in c major , pitch value g has scale position 7 .",
    "to remain at 7 , but change pitch from g to a , the musical key must change from c major to d major .",
    "for this reason , we sometimes call translation transposition , the everyday term for changing the key of a musical composition . * _ isomerization demands neither retuning nor re - keying . _ because of the other two motions , transformation and translation , without loss of generality we can constrain isomerization to preserve both guitar tuning and musical key .",
    "isomerization really implies a change of string and fret , leaving everything else constant .",
    "it is motion along _ iso - pitch lines , _ like contour lines on a topographic map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isopitch ] ) . may mislead insofar as it is drawn in the plane . its `` 45-degree '' appearance suggests that isomerization is a linear combination of two other directions of motion of tones , as if @xmath39 had only two dimensions , not the three proven in section [ ortho ] .",
    "but the axes of the figure are string number and fret number , rather than directions of motion .",
    "the figure can not represent anything about transformation or translation , because it represents neither tuning vectors nor musical keys .",
    "if it is to be interpreted as a picture through which tones move , the picture is a severely restricted one . ]",
    "a * cipher * is a vector of 6 intervals .",
    "a cipher can notate retuning , re - keying , or both .",
    "in other words , given a tuning , a key , and a fingering , if the tuning or key changes , then the cipher encodes how to restore the original pitches by changing the fingering , the word also alludes to how someone listening to a performance must discover the ` hidden ' guitar tuning _ before _ the actual fingering ( unravelling redundancy , section [ redundancy ] ) .    as a retuning example , to notate a change from standard to drop - d ( e - a - d - g - b - e@xmath1 to d - a - d - g - b - e@xmath1 ) , the cipher is the elementwise difference between these two tuning vectors ( starting arbitrarily from c=0 , so e=4 , a=9 , _ etc . _ ) : @xmath81 to leave pitches unchanged after this retuning , the cipher indicates that fret numbers increase by 2 on the first string , and remain unchanged on the other strings .",
    "more generally , the number of nonzero elements in a retuning cipher indicates how many strings were retuned . as a sign convention",
    "we let positive elements correspond to strings retuned lower , so elements can be directly added to fret numbers as a compensating offset to restore pitch .    on the other hand , as a re - keying example",
    ", the cipher @xmath82 notates a key change down two semitones , such as from e major to d major . to f@xmath5-b - e - a - c@xmath83-f@xmath83 .",
    "but in practice , a cipher with all elements equal indicates a change of key . ]",
    "again , the cipher s elements work as fret offsets : to play the same composition in the lower key , fret numbers must decrease by 2 on all strings .    like all vectors ,",
    "ciphers add elementwise .",
    "if we combined the previous two examples , perhaps because the composition was in e major while drop - d is more playable in d major , then the resulting cipher would be @xmath84 .    because a fret number @xmath15 is bounded ( @xmath20 ) , adding an element of a cipher to @xmath15 can push it out of range .",
    "when this happens , we replace that tone with another that has the same pitch value ( see section [ redundancy ] ) .",
    "this is far more common with negative cipher elements pushing @xmath15 negative than positive elements pushing @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath86 , the tone often moves only to the next lower string ( or lower still , until @xmath15 once again reaches nonnegativity ) .",
    "avoiding excessively low strings reduces stretching and jumping along the fingerboard ( see section [ playability ] ) .",
    "when precise voice - leading is not critical , the class of tone substitutions can increase to include octave substitutions .",
    "less rigorous resolutions of out - of - range fret numbers include replacing the tone with one whose pitch value is a different element in the currently sounding chord ( `` doubling a different note '' ) , and even outright omission of the offending tone .",
    "when choosing a fingering , we first obey the mechanical limits of the fingerboard and then consider more flexible desiderata .",
    "the first of these we formalize in the term redundancy , the second in playability .",
    "these constraints apply to not just software , but also to intuitive human searching for better fingering .",
    "the ubiquity of chess - playing software that is better than almost any human player has not dulled the appeal of learning to play chess oneself .",
    "similarly , software that finds optimal fingerings hardly makes manual search obsolete .",
    "indeed , a guitarist might prefer an inferior fingering ( that took longer to find ) to one found by computer but that demanded first typing in the notes , since pleasure is to be found in the hunt itself .",
    "this preference would in fact be forced for the many competent guitarists who do not read music , or for compositions that are too improvisational to be amenable to the task of data entry .      given a composition and a tuning ,",
    "the most elementary choice in fingering is : which ( string , fret ) pair should play a given pitch value ?",
    "we formalize this choice in a pitch value s redundancy , the number of tones that have it as a first element .",
    "mathematically , the redundancy of a pitch value @xmath87 is @xmath88 or , applying eq .  ,",
    "@xmath89 where @xmath87 is relative to the tuning @xmath90 , that is , pitch value zero corresponds to the lowest open string .",
    "for example , in standard tuning , e and g have a redundancy of 2 , while e has a redundancy of 1 .",
    "( of course , moving a given pitch to a lower string demands a higher fret . )",
    "if we shrink the intervals between adjacent strings of a tuning , then pitch values will increase in redundancy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : redundancy ] ) .",
    "the inevitable compromise is that such a tuning has a smaller interval between its lowest and highest strings , a smaller overall pitch range .",
    "this means fewer iso - pitch lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : isopitch ] ( topographically speaking , more widely spaced contour lines , that is , less steep terrain ) . the varying pitch ` elevations ' of a composition will then increase the width of both jumps and hand - stretches .",
    "we empirically observe that the more playable tunings are those which have redundancies slightly greater than one for a given composition s pitch values .",
    "redundancies of 4 or more may cost too much in terms of these jumps and stretches .",
    "the outermost strings necessarily include some pitch values with redundancy 1 .",
    "for example , the lowest string includes pitch values too low to be played on any other string .",
    "so from that redundancy-1 set of pitch values , only one at a time can sound .",
    "chords that include multiple members of that set can not be played .",
    "a similar constraint applies to the highest pitches on the highest string .",
    "for example , in standard tuning , both the lowest - string and highest - string redundancy-1 sets have 5 members .",
    "the 5 s come directly from the first and last digits of that tuning vector , 55545 .",
    "the bottom left and top right corners of fig .",
    "[ fig : isopitch ] render these as groups of 5 points , where each point is a degenerately short iso - pitch line .      for purposes of optimization",
    ", we may ignore capo without loss of generality .",
    "a proof of this has two directions .",
    "first , say a guitarist somehow finds an acceptable tuning , key , and fingering for a composition .",
    "if that happens to use a capo , and we remove the capo , then the same fingering still works when moved down the appropriate number of frets : the musical key will have merely been transposed .",
    "conversely , say someone wants to change musical keys to match a singer s vocal range , without changing fingering .",
    "a retuning may navely tighten all strings so far that the guitar neck deforms , but a capo solves this problem more conventionally .",
    "[ fig : capo ] shows how higher capos unsurprisingly reduce both redundancy and pitch range .",
    "so , at least for finding a fingering , there is no harm in omitting the complicating extra degree of freedom introduced by capo position .      in the context of performing a composition",
    ", playability is our aim of minimizing the demanded technical dexterity , the mechanical difficulty . among other things ,",
    "we wish to avoid wide stretches and large fast jumps .",
    "( this is just as true of keyboards as it is of fingerboards . )    given a particular fingering , we assign a collection of costs to it as suggested by previous work  @xcite @xcite @xcite . to determine an overall cost ,",
    "these costs are weighted to suit a particular guitarist s preferences .",
    "for example , one person might dread jumps , while another jumps confidently but is limited in chord choice by injury  @xcite or arthritis .",
    "we prefer stretches that span fewer frets .",
    "thus , for any chord we define its * span cost*. this is 0 for a barre chord ( plus open strings , if applicable ) .",
    "it increases monotonically to 1 for a 5-fret span . for larger",
    "spans it is @xmath91 , effectively forbidding such spans . at the high end of the fingerboard , where frets are spaced more closely",
    ", this may be less important , but a virtuoso comfortable in that stratosphere needs little guidance anyways .",
    "we prefer shorter jumps . closely related to this",
    ", we prefer keeping the hand at the low end of the fingerboard .",
    "empirically , this lets open strings play more often ; it is also more familiar to beginning players . for two consecutive chords , then",
    ", we define their * jump cost * as a monotonically increasing function of the jump size , that is , the number of frets moved by the index finger .",
    "( an absence of jumping yields a zero jump cost . )",
    "we prefer open strings .",
    "thus , for any chord we define its * fret cost*. this is zero if no strings are fretted , and increases monotonically to one as the number of fretted strings increases to 6 .",
    "( four fingers can fret more than four strings , as in barre chords . )    as a side effect of this preference for open strings , a constraint between tunings and musical keys arises .",
    "given a tuning , the musical keys that are generally more playable are those whose pitch classes are found in the tuning s open strings .",
    "this is especially so for pitch classes with harmonically important roles like the tonic , subdominant , and dominant : three or four musical keys satisfy this for most tunings .    as an elementary demonstration of this , guitar music performed in standard tuning often uses the key of e major , where four open strings play harmonically important pitches , namely e , a , b , and e@xmath1 .",
    "conversely , standard tuning almost never uses the key of e@xmath92 , where the only diatonic open strings are d and g , pitches with less important harmonic roles ( leading tone and mediant ) .",
    "when manually exploring fingerings and tunings , a ` tuning - key path ' may happen : as a new tuning is tried , a new key suggests itself , which may in turn suggest another tuning , and so on .",
    "we prefer slower jumps . for two consecutive chords ,",
    "we define their * speed cost * as the duration expected to perform the jump divided by the duration allowed .",
    "the expected duration is predicted by fitts s law  @xcite .",
    "consequently , jumps towards the low end of the fingerboard , where frets are spaced more widely , are less costly .",
    "this agrees with empirical observation .",
    "once an acceptable tuning , key , and fingering is found , tablature notates this result better than a five - line staff .",
    "tablature directly notates fingering , and is thus better for evaluating playability .",
    "although staff notation is better suited to the tools of traditional music theory , it needs awkward diacritical marks to map pitches to particular strings and frets , and the guitar s tuning must be extraneously indicated .",
