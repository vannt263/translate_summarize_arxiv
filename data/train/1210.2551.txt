    "[ fmthardcores ] contains contributions to the excess free energy that are of third order in density . in this section",
    "we compare the results from this theory to those from an extended onsager theory with parsons - lee rescaling that explicitly includes only two - body interactions . for details about parsons - lee theory ,",
    "the phase diagram of a hard core mixture with size ratio @xmath124 according to parsons - lee theory is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figpl ] .",
    "it is to be compared with panels ( a1 ) and ( b1 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where corresponding results obtain from fmt are shown .",
    "an immediately noticeable difference is in the location of the @xmath0 phase transition in the pure fluid of platelets . in this limit ( @xmath128 ) parsons - lee theory gives an unchanged result as compared to onsager theory due to the vanishing packing fraction in the pure fluid of platelets .",
    "hence parsons - lee theory clearly overestimates the coexisting densities ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) .",
    "it also predicts a much too high nematic order parameter at the @xmath0 coexistence , @xmath155 ( not shown ) , compared to fmt and mc simulation .",
    "for @xmath124 the topology of the phase diagram predicted by both theories is the same . according to parsons - lee theory",
    "the partitioning between isotropic and nematic phases is higher than in fmt .",
    "a similar trend was observed comparing the current fmt and onsager theory in binary mixtures of hard platelets with different radius @xcite .",
    "parsons - lee theory predicts demixing between two nematic phases in mixtures with high size ratio , as does fmt .",
    "however , the minimal size ratio for phase segregation to occur between two nematics ( using parsons - lee theory ) is @xmath156 , considerably higher than the threshold for fmt , which is @xmath157 .",
    "one important difference is that parsons - lee theory predicts @xmath141 demixing for low size ratios @xmath158 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath141 phase boundary is located at very high pressures and densities and is most likely metastable with respect to segregation between an isotropic phase rich in platelets and a solid phase rich in spheres .",
    "we have investigated the fluid bulk phase behaviour of mixtures of colloidal platelets and spheres using a geometry - based density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the size ratio @xmath159 is the key parameter that controls the behaviour of the system . in mixtures with @xmath160",
    "we find only @xmath0 phase separation .",
    "we have identified two different mechanisms behind the @xmath0 phase transition .",
    "if the composition of spheres is low , the @xmath0 transition is driven by the excluded volume interaction between the platelets , similar to the mechanism in a pure fluid of platelets . in this regime , the transition takes place between two phases with low partitioning . as the composition of spheres",
    "is increased , the interaction between dissimilar species becomes dominant , and the ( unfavourable ) excluded volume interactions between spheres and platelets drives strong demixing between an isotropic sphere - rich phase and a nematic platelet - rich phase",
    ".    mixtures with high size ratio , @xmath161 , also display demixing between two nematics at different compositions .",
    "however reliably describing such highly asymmetric mixtures is a very difficult for any theoretical treatment , see the comparison of fmt and simulation results for asymmetric binary hard sphere mixtures @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of demixing between two isotropic fluids in mixtures of colloidal platelets and spheres remains an open question .",
    "the fmt approach does not predict @xmath141 demixing .",
    "previous studies @xcite reported @xmath141 phase separation in mixtures were the size of both species is similar . nevertheless , in both studies the authors neglected excluded volume interactions between platelets .",
    "this approximation is valid only if the platelets density is very low . in contrast",
    "our theory includes platelet - platelet interactions , modelled via up to cubic contributions in platelet density to the free energy .",
    "the bulk free energy for isotropic states from the present dft is the same as that from scaled - particle theory @xcite , which gives further confidence into our results .",
    "carrying out a careful simulation study in order to shed further light on the existence of @xmath141 demixing in the hard core mixture would be very valuable .",
    "we have not considered spatially inhomogeneous phases in this work .",
    "the pure fluid of hard spheres undergoes a fluid - solid phase transitions .",
    "the freezing transition , according to monte carlo simulations @xcite , takes place at packing fractions @xmath162 for the liquid and @xmath163 for the solid ( values which are higher than the packing fractions considered in the present work ) .",
    "hence , we expect our fluid phase diagrams to be stable with respect to freezing of the hard spheres . for low size ratios ( smaller than those analysed here )",
    "we expect an isotropic - solid demixing region in the phase diagram .",
    "columnar as well as solid phases become relevant in systems of platelets with non - vanishing thickness at sufficiently high densities .",
    "hence , it is possible that nematic - nematic demixing in mixtures with high size ratio will be metastable with respect to columnar ordering .",
    "recent experiments by lekkerkerker _",
    "et al . _ on mixtures of charged gibbsite platelets and silica spheres @xcite have shown a large isotropic - columnar coexisting region .",
    "columnar ordering has also been studied theoretically in mixtures of board - like platelets and spheres in a cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "smectic phases are not very common in discotic liquid crystals , but they could appear in real systems with finite thickness @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with mixtures of colloidal gibbsite platelets and spheres @xcite show that also glass formation can occur at sufficiently high sphere concentrations .    as our theory is mean - field in character",
    ", we expect the location of nematic - nematic critical point to change upon including neglected fluctuations , say in computer simulations .",
    "such ( future ) work could ascertain the stability of nematic - nematic demixing .",
    "furthermore it would be interesting to consider the stability of the nematic - nematic transition upon altering the platelet - polymer interactions , in order to take into account penetrability of platelets and polymers .",
    "the results presented in this work can form the basis for studies of inhomogeneous platelet - sphere mixtures using dft , such as the analysis of the effects of gravity @xcite , as well as wetting and confinement effects .",
