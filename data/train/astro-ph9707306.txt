    "until recently , it was widely believed that the numerous , diffuse h  i clouds which give rise to the dense ly@xmath0-forest lines seen in high - redshift qso spectra are _ intergalactic _ clouds not directly associated with galaxies ( sargent  et al .",
    "however , since the launch of _ hst _  and the subsequent discovery of ly@xmath0 lines in the uv at redshifts @xmath7 1 ( bahcall  et al.1991 ; morris  et al .",
    "1991 ) , our understanding of their origin has become somewhat confused .",
    "the low - redshifts of these newly identified systems have made it possible to directly search for galaxies which may be responsible for the absorption , and deep ccd images of fields around observed qsos , combined with spectroscopic confirmation of candidate galaxies , initially suggested that ly@xmath0 clouds are only weakly associated with galaxies on scales of @xmath8  mpc ( morris  et al .",
    "1993 , hereafter m93 ; stocke et al .",
    "later studies , however , found that most luminous galaxies at @xmath9 are apparently surrounded by extended gaseous envelopes @xmath10  kpc in radius , where @xmath11 is the hubble constant , and @xmath12 throughout this paper ] and that the fraction of ly@xmath0-forest lines which occur in galaxies is high , between @xmath13  % ( lanzetta  et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter lbtw ) .",
    "confusingly , a study identical in method and objective , but using different sightlines , failed to confirm this result ( le brun  et  al . 1996 ) and instead suggested that ly@xmath0  lines may simply follow the large scale structures which the brightest galaxies map out .",
    "more recent observations have shown that at least some ly@xmath0  absorbers reside in galaxy voids ( shull  et  al .",
    "1996 ) , although what that fraction is remains unclear .    in a previous paper ( bowen , blades , & pettini 1996 ; hereafter bbp ) we conducted a search for ly@xmath0  absorption lines from _ nearby _ galaxies , since it is easier to study the origin and characteristics of ly@xmath0  clouds in the local universe .",
    "we concluded that nearby galaxies do not possess ly@xmath0-absorbing halos beyond @xmath14  @xmath2  kpc , and that _ if _ absorption systems were directly associated with chosen galaxies , then @xmath15% of galaxies had absorbing halos of radii @xmath16  @xmath2  kpc .",
    "however , several facts led us to question whether galaxies we identified were actually responsible for a ly@xmath0  line when absorption was found , and we proposed that the most likely explanation was that absorbers follow the large - scale structure of the galaxy distribution , a conclusion similar to that drawn by le brun  et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) at higher redshift and supported by numerical simulations of the high redshift universe ( e.g. cen  et  al .  1994 ; petitjean , mcket & kates 1995 ; zhang  et  al .  1995 ; mcket  et  al .",
    "an alternative explanation is that ly@xmath0  absorbers are associated with dwarf galaxies or low surface - brightness galaxies ; in that case the bright galaxies we had selected which appeared to show absorption were not in fact directly responsible for the absorption .",
    "a similar suggestion has been made by shull  et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the observations reported in bbp were designed to study the incidence of absorption in galactic halos ; we did not , however , quantify the fraction of the ly@xmath0-forest associated with galaxies . to determine this quantity ,",
    "complete redshift information must be obtained in the field of a qso sightline to ensure that any galaxy which might be associated with any particular absorption line could be detected  at least to some limiting magnitude .",
    "we have therefore begun a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in fields of selected qsos observed with _",
    "hst _  in the far uv , to characterise any association of ly@xmath0  absorption systems with present day galaxies and their large scale structure . with the advent of multi - fibre spectrographs able to obtain redshifts of relatively faint galaxies over large areas of sky , it is now feasible to pursue such a study . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of our programme , identification of a magnitude limited sample of galaxies toward the bright qso 1821 + 643 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this was one of the first qsos to be observed with _",
    "( bahcall  et  al .",
    "1992 ) , and was one of the sightlines studied by le  brun  et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) in order to identify intermediate - redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers . q1821 + 643",
    "is unique in being one of the few qsos bright enough to be observed with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aboard _ hst _  _ and _ the medium resolution gratings of the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) .",
    "this means that over small wavelength regions it is possible to search for weak ly@xmath0  lines ( equivalent widths @xmath18  m ) which can not be seen in fos data .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  2.1 we present spectra of galaxies obtained with the multi - fibre spectrographs wyffos / af-2 attached to the william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma , and hydra on the wiyn telescope at the kitt peak national observatory . ",
    "2.2 discusses our re - analysis of the avilable _ hst _  data . in ",
    "3 we present the results from our survey , and discuss the size of individual galaxy halos (  3.1 ) and the association of ly@xmath0  lines with galaxies in general (  3.2 ) . in ",
    "3.3 we consider whether the associations found are significant compared to a random distribution of galaxies and absorbers .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in  3.5 .",
    "lists of galaxy candidates were produced from a scan of the poss - ii plate pj3948c which covers the field of q1821 + 643 using the automated plate measuring ( apm ) scanning machine in cambridge .",
    "the majority of spectra were obtained with the wyffos / af-2 instrument on the wht on august 20 and august 22nd 1995 .",
    "wyffos is a bench spectrograph situated at the nasmyth platform of the wht , fed by 2.7 arcsec fibres positioned at the prime focus of the telescope using the autofib-2 fibre positioner , with a circular field of view of 30 arcmins radius .",
    "data were obtained using the r600b grating centered at 5200    and a thinned tektronix 1024 ccd as the detector giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath19   .",
    "fibre  configurations were produced using the configure routine , with priority given to the brightest objects in our sample . with a configuration completed , objects already allocated with a fibre were removed from the list , and the configuration routine run again , with the same magnitude priority acting on the list to produce the next configuration .",
    "two exposures of 1200 sec were taken at each fibre configuration .",
    "fibres unallocated to galaxy candidates were used for obtaining sky spectra , and wavelength calibration frames were taken for each fibre configuration . to maximise the efficiency of the available telescope time",
    ", we decided to obtain spectra of all objects with apm magnitudes of @xmath20 in the 30 arcmin radius field of view .",
    "spectra were obtained of 69 objects using 3 fibre configurations .",
    "these objects are listed in table  [ gallist ] , with object designation given in column  1 .",
    "the nomenclature of objects is arbitrary , but the ext designation indicates objects which were not selected from the apm scans as galaxies , but were nevertheless added either because their classification as galaxies were marginal or because of their proximity to the qso sightline .",
    "all these objects turned out to be stars .",
    "data were reduced using the wyffos data reduction package ( lewis 1996 ) running under iraf .",
    "redshifts of extracted spectra were measured by cross - correlation with two radial velocity standards hd182572 ( @xmath21  km  s@xmath22 ) and hd171391 ( @xmath23  km  s@xmath22 ) using the rv iraf package .",
    "the resolution of our data , as measured from the calibration arc lines , was 6.2   , or 350  km  s@xmath22  at 5300   ; cross - correlation of galaxy spectra with template radial standards is known to give accuracies of @xmath24 fwhm , or @xmath25  km  s@xmath22  for our data .",
    "cross correlation of the two radial velocity standards with each other easily found the correct shift , confirming that the technique could certainly measure velocities to at least 100  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "sky was subtracted from each spectrum using summed sky spectra obtained during object exposures .",
    "column 6 of table  [ gallist ] indicates the quality of the final spectrum : ` a ' indicates a certain redshift , measured independently from both of the two exposures of a given fibre configuration ; ` b ' also indicates a certain redshift ( more than one feature is identified in a spectrum ) but the redshift could only be measured accurately from one of the exposures ; ` c ' means a redshift could be measured but the data were of low quality and the redshift may be uncertain ( this applied to only two objects in our sample ) ; ` d ' indicates that no redshift could be measured .    of 69 objects observed , 63 redshifts were obtained .",
    "of these , 44 were galaxies .",
    "redshifts for 68 objects are given in column  5 of table  [ gallist ] ( obj56 in the original list of 69 objects measured was removed  see  2.1.2 ) , along with the ra & dec of the object ( cols . 2 and 3 ) , the @xmath26 magnitude derived from the apm scans ( col .",

    "spectra were obtained of 80 objects .",

    "as noted above , our initial goal was to observe all galaxies within 30 arcmins of the sightline of q1821 + 643 down to a magnitude of @xmath1 . combining the wyffos and hydra data , we measured 68 of 71 galaxy candidates , a completeness of 96% .",
    "17 of 68 candidates , or 25% , were found to be stars .",

    "there exist several independent observations of q1821 + 643 made with _",
    "hst _ , covering different wavelength ranges and obtained at different resolutions .",
    "the first data were obtained with the _ fos _ by bahcall  et  al .",
    "( 1992 , hereafter b92 ) using the g130h , g190h , and g270h gratings , and subsequently reanalysed as part of the absorption line key project ( bahcall  et  al .",
    "1993 , hereafter kpi ) .",
    "higher resolution data from the ghrs were obtained by savage , sembach & lu ( 1995 , hereafter ssl ) with the g160 m grating over two small wavelength regions from @xmath35    and @xmath36   . finally , ghrs g140l data are available from the _ hst _  archive , taken 30-march-1996 and covering the wavelength range @xmath37   .    comparing the list of ly@xmath0  absorption lines identified in fos spectra by b92 and kpi shows several inconsistencies which arise from changes in their method of line identification .",
    "further , the high resolution ghrs spectra obtained by ssl show that some of the initial identifications in the fos spectra were erroneous . to derive a list of ly@xmath0  absorption systems to compare with galaxies detected in our spectroscopic survey , we have extracted the fos and ghrs data from the _ hst _  archive and reanalysed the data with our own software .",
    "our identification of absorption lines follows similar procedures to those described by young  et  al .",
    "( 1979 ) and by b92 .",
    "( these procedures differ from those used subsequently by kpi who used the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) of the spectrograph to weight the summation of pixels comprising a line in the determination of its equivalent width . )",
    "there are several differences in our analysis to those used by b92 and kpi .",
    "first , we have corrected the fos wavelength scales by applying a shift to match the rest wavelengths of low ionization lines arising from galactic absorption in the spectra to the velocity of the bulk of h  i emission measured at 21  cm .",
    "we take the heliocentric velocity of this gas to be at @xmath38  km  s@xmath22  ( lockman & savage 1995 ) .",
    "second , no accurate lsfs are available for the fos aperture used ( @xmath39 ) so we have not used an lsf to estimate the equivalent widths of lines . instead , we have taken the number of pixels over which an absorption feature is detected to be 11 .",
    "this , for example , is the extent of the lsf for the @xmath40 aperture ( see bbp ) .",
    "third , error arrays supplied by the pipeline wavelength calibration of fos spectra do not include any contribution from the background or from other sources such as scattered light , and are therefore inadequate for determining the reality of a feature in a spectrum .",
    "we have therefore constructed arrays from measured rms deviations in regions of a spectrum clearly free of absorption lines , and used these for our error arrays .",
    "the flux arrays used to measure the noise are those prior to the data being resampled to a linear wavelength scale because resampling introduces a smoothing of the flux . for ghrs data ,",
    "the pipeline calibrated error arrays are true representations of the noise in the data , and can be used for detection and measurement of absorption lines .",
    "our final line lists consist of lines at wavelength @xmath41 , with observed equivalent widths , @xmath42 , which are @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the error in the equivalent width at @xmath41 . for lines which are in common with those found by b92 and kpi ,",
    "the majority of our measurements of @xmath42 are within @xmath45 of their measurements . hence our measurements of @xmath42 give values close to those already published .",
    "only if a line sits on the peak of an emission line do equivalent widths differ by more that @xmath45 , because errors inherent in continuum fitting around the emission line mean that the true value of @xmath46 is greater than that estimated from the noise . of the 18 lines we detect in fos or published ghrs data ,",
    "15 have been identified by b92 , ssl , and/or kpi .",
    "we detect an additional ly@xmath0  line in the ghrs data at 1252.1   , which is weak , but present at the 3@xmath47 level in our analysis .",
    "another two lines are marginal detections in the fos g130h data , but are confirmed in the unpublished ghrs g140l spectrum .",
    "the ly@xmath0  lines we identify are listed in table  [ linelist ] .",
    "column 4 lists the absorption redshift , @xmath48 , of the absorption line ; column 5 , @xmath49 , indicates whether the redshift has been determined from the high resolution g160 m ghrs spectra of ssl , either by direct measurement of the ly@xmath0  line or higher order lyman lines of the same absorption system .",
    "measurements of @xmath48 using these spectra are more accurate than those derived from the fos data .",
    "column 6 lists the absolute magnitude we reach in our survey at @xmath48 given the limiting observed magnitude of @xmath50 .",
    "column 7 lists in which spectra the lines have been identified , while in column 8 we record whether the authors mentioned above also identified the line .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,^ , > , < \" , ]     of the ten ly@xmath0  lines listed in table  4 we are unable to detect any galaxies at similar redshifts from five ( 50% ) of them .",
    "this result is shown graphically in a plot of @xmath51 vs.  @xmath28 for nine of the absorption systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : percent2 ] ( for this figure , we have assumed that the weak line at @xmath52 , separated by 450  km  s@xmath22  from the @xmath53 line , is associated with the galaxy 104  @xmath2  kpc  from the qso sightline ) .",
    "the figure suggests that at least half of the ly@xmath0  lines are intergalactic in origin .",
    "as mentioned above , eight of the ten ly@xmath0  lines are weaker than @xmath54   ; hence we are discussing a population of ly@xmath0  lines much weaker than those detectable in fos spectra .",
    "six of these eight weak absorbers have no bright galaxies at separations less than ( @xmath55  @xmath2  mpc .",
    "there are two strong lines ( @xmath56   ) at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and both have galaxies 578 and 104  @xmath2  kpc  from the qso sightline respectively .",
    "again , the question is whether these associations are coincidental , a question we attempt to answer in  3.3 .",
    "our survey detects one obvious group of galaxies at @xmath59 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wedges ] ) .",
    "as noted above , possible absorption by ly@xmath0  at this redshift is unfortunately obscured by a weak galactic c  i absorption line .",
    "it is clear though that strong ly@xmath0  absorption , with equivalent widths greater than the @xmath42(c  i@xmath60)@xmath61    observed , is _ not _ associated with this group of galaxies .",
    "a direct association between galaxy groups and ly@xmath0  absorption systems has been claimed by lanzetta  et  al .",

    "this clearly shows that loose groups of galaxies  where intracluster gas might be expected to produce absorption  need not produce ly@xmath0absorption .",
    "m93 found a similar example towards 3c  273 .",
    "in contrast , there are three absorption lines at @xmath67 ( a depth of @xmath68  @xmath2  mpc ) which are offset from this galaxy group , and unassociated with any galaxies brighter than @xmath69",
    ". there are @xmath70 published examples of a ly@xmath0  line lying in a void between galaxy structures at low - redshift ( shull  et  al .",
    "1996 ) , and , if the identification of the @xmath71 and 0.0454 systems towards q1821 + 643 is correct ( see  2.2 ) , then this would be another good example of ly@xmath0  lines avoiding galaxies .",
    "of course , at @xmath72 , 30 arcmins corresponds to only 1@xmath2  mpc , which makes it possible that galaxies forming part of a loose group at these redshifts might be missed .",
    "if we consider galaxies listed in the ned outside our 30 arcmin survey radius , we find only eight nearby galaxies , at large distances of @xmath73  @xmath2  mpc  from the qso line of sight within a redshift range @xmath74 .",
    "although the catalogue of galaxies from the ned is in no sense complete , ( and drawing any inferences from such a catalog may be highly misleading ) , this does suggest that some ly@xmath0  absorbers avoid galaxies on scales of at least a few mpc .",
    "it is clear from the proceeding section that we need a statistical approach to establishing whether apparent galaxy - absorber correlations are real . in this section , therefore , we calculate the galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - absorber cross - correlation functions in our data set to test the significance of such associations .",
    "we have used the formalism given by mann , saunders & taylor ( 1996 ) , which for the galaxy - galaxy correlation function reduces to the estimator of @xmath75 given by hamilton ( 1993 ) . to calculate the galaxy - absorber cross - correlation , @xmath76 , in redshift space , where separations are denoted as @xmath77",
    ", we have used their generalization    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the weighted pair counts of galaxies and lines whose separation places them in a bin centred on @xmath77 , @xmath80 is the corresponding weighted count for a random catalogue of a ) galaxies covering the same area of sky and having the same selection function as the data , and b ) lines randomly distributed along the line of sight with a correction for an evolving number density with redshift .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath80 are the weighted counts of cross pairs between the data and the random catalogs .    for the weighting of the pair",

    "1996 ) , @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 to evaluate @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , the correlation function we calculate is relatively insensitive to using this weighting function . for absorption lines ,",
    "@xmath93 is always set equal to unity .",
    "to ensure the correct number density of lines , random catalogs were generated with the number of lines @xmath94 , where @xmath95 ( bahcall  et  al .",
    "although this is inevitably only an approximation , because we have included ly@xmath0  lines with equivalent widths less than the @xmath96    used to evaluate @xmath97 , the correction has little effect over the small redshift range discussed herein . for all estimates of @xmath98 and @xmath99 ,",
    "we have used 10000 points for the random catalogues , and a maximum redshift of @xmath100 . for @xmath99 , we have used a minimum redshift of 0.0060 for lines and galaxies , since below this , we can not distinguish ly@xmath0  lines from the damped ly@xmath0  line of our own milky way .",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross1 ] ( top ) the galaxy auto - correlation function for galaxies weighted in the way described in equation 2 .",
    "errors shown are @xmath101 error bars calculated in the way prescribed by mo  et  al .",
    "also plotted is @xmath102 from the lcrs ( dotted line ) .",
    "the figure shows , unsurprisingly , that the galaxies are clustered in much the same way as seen in more extensive galaxy surveys .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross2 ] we plot the galaxy - absorber correlation function , @xmath76 . for bins with no galaxies or ly@xmath0  clouds detected ,",
    "we have set @xmath103 to indicate the size of bins used to calculate @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross2]a the correlation is dominated by a single point between @xmath104  @xmath2  mpc ; this is obj172 lying 104  @xmath2  kpc  from the qso sightline ( table  [ neargals ] ) at a redshift of 0.1216 .",
    "this correlation calculation assumes a ( comoving ) hubble flow ; hence the difference between @xmath105 and @xmath48 of @xmath106 means that the distance of galaxy and absorber becomes 518  @xmath2  kpc , even though this value of @xmath107 is within our measurement errors of @xmath105 and @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of a galaxy at these impact parameters remains statistically significant ; given a random distribution of galaxies and absorbers , we would only have expected 0.02 pairs instead of the one we found .",
    "hence this galaxy - absorber association is unlikely to have arisen by chance .",
    "apart from this pair , fig .",
    "[ fig : cross2]a shows that the majority of absorbers are uncorrelated with galaxies , that is , that galaxies at similar redshifts to absorbers on scales of @xmath108  @xmath2  mpc  in fig .",
    "[ fig : percent ] probably arise by chance .",
    "we note a slight excess between @xmath109  @xmath2  mpc , but the point is within @xmath110 of @xmath111 ( 7 pairs were expected , 10 were detected ) .",
    "we note that the lack of any galaxy - absorber pairs at separations of @xmath112 and 0.27  @xmath2  mpc  is not significant : compared with the randomly generated catalogue of galaxies and absorbers , less than 1 galaxy - absorber association was expected for each of these bins .    the problems in taking the projected two - point correlation function and estimating the proper three - dimensional spatial correlation function ( davis & peebles 1983 ) for galaxies and absorbers are discussed in detail by m93 .",
    "it is of more interest , however , to calculate @xmath76 using a `` retarded hubble flow '' to take into account the possibility that a galaxy and an absorber may be at the same ( radial ) distance from us , but have peculiar velocities with respect to each due to the origin of the absorbing gas ( e.g. halo gas co - rotating with a galaxy disk ) .",
    "hence in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross2]b we calculate @xmath76 with @xmath113 set to zero if the measured value is @xmath114  km  s@xmath22 , and @xmath113 corrected to @xmath115  km  s@xmath22  if @xmath116  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "( the resulting correlation is changed little by adopting values of @xmath117  km  s@xmath22as the criterion for setting @xmath118 . )",
    "the figure shows that in this case , absorbers and galaxies tend to more consistently have values of @xmath119 .",
    "this suggests that absorbers and galaxies are weakly associated if it is _ assumed _ that the velocity difference is not related to any real physical separation , i.e. if the real separation between galaxy and absorber is the measured value of @xmath28 .",
    "however , it is important to realise not only that all the points are within @xmath110 of @xmath111 , but that this correlation is sensitive to the exact sample of ly@xmath0  lines used ; simply removing a line at random from the list to test the robustness of the correlation can remove the apparent consistency of having most of the points with @xmath119 .",
    "this lack of robustness is not surprising given the small sample size of our data set .",
    "we conclude that weak absorbers are uncorrelated , or at best , weakly correlated , with galaxies , on scales of beyond a few hundred @xmath2  kpc  or more .",
    "given that there may be more of a significance for the retarded hubble flow estimate of @xmath76 , we can speculate on what this might mean . in what scenarios",
    "could galaxies and absorbers be at the same radial distance from us ?",
    "one possibility is that absorbing gas is directly associated with the identified galaxy .",
    "this seems unlikely for points in fig .",
    "[ fig : percent ] and  [ fig : percent2 ] with @xmath120  @xmath2  mpcsince there is good evidence that individual galaxy halos do not have absorbing gas beyond @xmath121  @xmath2  kpc  ( lbtw ; bbp ) .",
    "a second possibility is that the gas is a remnant of prior galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "although tidal debris is not a favoured explanation for the origin of the @xmath122 mg  ii absorption lines ( see , e.g. steidel  et  al .",
    "1994 ) , nearby interacting galaxies have been shown to produce the characteristics of higher redshift mg  ii systems ( bowen  et  al .",
    "1995 ) , while tidal debris as an origin of ly@xmath0  absorbers has been discussed by morris & van den bergh ( 1994 ) .",
    "this interpretation will remain hard to test , as observing the more subtle signs of galaxy - galaxy interactions is difficult .",
    "finally , galaxies and absorbers could be at similar distances if they inhabit the same dark matter ( dm ) structures which constitute the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "many cdm - based numerical simulations ( e.g. cen  et  al .  1994 ; petitjean , mcket & kates 1995 ; zhang  et  al .  1995 ; mcket  et  al .",
    "1996 ) now point to the possibility that low column density h  i gas simply follows the same lss as galaxies ( at least at high redshift ) .",
    "it seems likely that galaxies and absorbers which lie in dm sheets and filaments will have small ( but non - zero ) velocity differences , since the velocity width of galaxy shells seen in local lss is @xmath123  km  s@xmath22(e.g .",
    "santiago 1995 ) .",
    "hence the measured values of @xmath28 may well represent real distances between galaxies and absorbers , at least for sheets aligned perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "we have detected a single galaxy 104  @xmath2  kpc  from the line of sight of q1821 + 643 ; ly@xmath0  absorption arises at the same redshift as the galaxy to within measurement errors .",
    "the association is statistically significant compared to a randomly distributed ensemble of clouds and galaxies , suggesting a direct link between absorber and galaxy .",
    "the line is strong ( @xmath3   ) and its detection is consistent with those of similarly strong lines within 160  @xmath2  kpc  of bright galaxies found by lbtw .",
    "the next nearest galaxies are 291  @xmath2  kpc  and 410  @xmath2  kpc  away from the sightline , and these show no absorption to very low equivalent width limits ( @xmath124   ) within 600  km  s@xmath22 . beyond 500  @xmath2  kpc , several absorption systems are found at similar redshifts to the galaxies , but these coincidences are likely to be accidental .",
    "five of ten ( 50% ) ly@xmath0  absorption systems out to a redshift of @xmath125 have no galaxies within 600  km  s@xmath22  and separations less than ( @xmath126 )  @xmath2  mpc . at these redshifts ,",
    "our magnitude limited redshift survey would have been able to detect at least @xmath5 luminosity galaxies . excluding the one ly@xmath0  system apparently associated with the galaxy described above , two ly@xmath0  systems have galaxies within 600  km  s@xmath22  and @xmath127  @xmath2  mpc , but these associations are again probably coincidental .",
    "eight of the ten lines have _ weak _ equivalent widths ( @xmath6   ) , and we conclude that this population is uncorrelated , or at best , weakly correlated , with galaxies .",
    "a similar result was found by stocke  et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) for lines with @xmath128  detected in their own and previously published data sets .",
    "the nature of the strong lines is less clear .",
    "the detection of strong lines within 200  @xmath2  kpc  of galaxies by lbtw , and the association of one of two strong lines ( out to a redshift of 0.12 ) with a galaxy at a separation of 104  @xmath2  kpc  in our own survey supports the idea that strong lines are associated with galaxies while weak ones are intergalactic in origin .",
    "this is the ` two - population ' explanation proposed by mo & morris ( 1994 ) and bahcall  et  al .",
    "the difficulty in unambiguously drawing this conclusion from our analysis is that our data set contains too few strong lines at low redshift to adequately characterise the nature of this population .",
    "le brun  et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) have published the only other available survey of the association of strong ( fos - detectable ) lines with galaxies ; of 13 ly@xmath0  systems listed with @xmath129   , four have galaxies coincident in velocity which are within 200  @xmath2  kpc  of a qso sightline , five are in the range @xmath130  @xmath2  kpc , and the remaining four are at separations beyond 1.0  @xmath2  mpc   a roughly even spread in impact parameters .",
    "much of this ambiguity may be down to the 43  % completeness of their survey at @xmath131 , which ensures considerable difficulty in detecting intermediate brightness galaxies at the redshifts of the ly@xmath0  systems studied , @xmath132 . however , detection of even a few bright galaxies so close to ly@xmath0  systems may suggest that strong lines are directly associated with galaxies",
    ". clearly , to explore this possibility further , more complete galaxy surveys are required at the redshifts of strong lines .",

    "our results do not rule out the possibility that strong ly@xmath0  lines are directly associated with galaxies of _ all _ luminosities  including faint dwarf galaxies which have not been found in the surveys described above  on scales of a few hundred @xmath2  kpc .",
    "this would explain why it has been easy to find some absorbing galaxies ( i.e. the bright ones ) while some strong lines appear to have no associated galaxies ( those which are too faint to be detected ) . only rauch et  al .  ( 1996 ) have searched for low surface brightness galaxies which might be responsible for ly@xmath0  absorption lines toward 3c  273 , and none were detected , although two faint galaxies ( cgcg014@xmath31054 , @xmath134 and the h  i cloud h  i  1225 + 01 , @xmath135 ) are at similar redshifts to the lowest redshifted ly@xmath0  lines at 1012 and 1582  km  s@xmath22   and within @xmath136  @xmath2  kpc .",
    "bbp also found ly@xmath0  absorption toward q1001 + 2910 at the same velocity as ugca201 ( @xmath134 , @xmath137  @xmath2  kpc ) with no other galaxies nearby .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to test whether these coincidences are accidental or not .    the amount of data needed to fully understand the origin of the ly@xmath0-forest is still far from available . obtaining high quality , high resolution _ hst _",
    "spectra toward q1821 + 643 demonstrates the importance of such data , not only for exploring the weak population of ly@xmath0  lines , but simply in disentangling the ly@xmath0-forest from galactic absorption lines when working at low - redshift .",
    "the nature of the strong lines remains unclear , and as mentioned above , a direct search for ly@xmath0  lines within a few hundred @xmath2  kpc  of nearby , isolated galaxies would provide much needed information as to whether strong lines alone are directly associated with galaxies .",
