    "as is well known , dynamical chaos in hamiltonian systems is related to the destruction of separatrices of nonlinear resonances . for a strong interaction between the resonances ,",
    "the latter can overlap in the phase space , thus leading to a _ global chaos _ for which chaotic region is spanned over the whole phase space of a system , although large isolated islands of stability may persist . for a weak interaction ,",
    "chaotic motion occurs only in the vicinity of separatrices of the resonances , in accordance with the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in the case of two degrees of freedom ( @xmath0 ) , a passage of the trajectory from one stochastic region in phase space to another",
    "is blocked by kam surfaces .",
    "the situation changes drastically in many - dimensional systems ( @xmath1 ) , where the kam surfaces no longer separate one stochastic region from another , and _",
    "chaotic layers _ of destroyed separatrices form a _ stochastic web _ that can cover the whole phase space . thus ,",
    "if trajectory starts inside the stochastic web , it can diffuse throughout the phase space .",
    "this weak diffusion along stochastic webs was predicted by arnold in 1964 @xcite , and since that time it is known as a very peculiar phenomenon , universal for nonlinear hamiltonian systems with @xmath1 .",
    "there are many physical systems which behavior appears to be strongly affected by the arnold diffusion . as examples",
    ", one should mention three - boby gravitational systems @xcite and galaxies dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the arnold diffusion may have strong impact for the behaviour of our solar system , it is also responsible for a loss of electrons in magnetic traps ( see discussion and references in @xcite ) . from the practical point of view",
    ", the arnold diffusion may be dangerous for long - time stability of motion of charge particles in high energy storage rings @xcite .",
    "recently , the arnold diffusion was explored in the classical description of rydberg atoms placed in crossed static electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approach has been used for the stochastic pump model @xcite , where the effect of quantization of the arnold diffusion in a system of two pairs of weakly coupled oscillators has been investigated .    for the first time , the arnold diffusion was observed in numerical study of a @xmath2-dimensional nonlinear map @xcite .",
    "the more physical model of two coupled nonlinear oscillators with time - dependent perturbation was considered , both analytically and numerically , in @xcite ( see also review @xcite and the books @xcite ) .",
    "numerical experiments with this model have confirmed analytical estimates obtained for the diffusion coefficient in dependence on model parameters ( for recent studies on this subject see @xcite ) .",
    "note that direct numerical study of the arnold diffusion is quite difficult since its rate is exponentially small , and it occurs only for initial conditions inside vary narrow stochastic layers .",
    "one should distinguish stochastic web for the arnold diffusion from that found for systems which are linear in the absence of a perturbation , see for example @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the stochastic web arises around a _",
    "single _ nonlinear resonance that has infinite number of cells in the phase space ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so far , the studies of the arnold diffusion are restricted by the classical ( or semiclassical ) approaches . on the other hand , it is important to understand the influence of quantum effects .",
    "the problem is not trivial since strong quantum effects can completely suppress weak diffusion along narrow stochastic layers , even in a deep semiclassical region @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the fingerprint of the arnold diffusion in a quantum model , by making use a direct numerical simulation of some nonlinear system , both in classical and quantum description .",
    "preliminary data are reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the basic model is introduced and discussed .",
    "we describe shortly the mechanism of the classical arnold diffusion in classical system and give the expression for the diffusion coefficient . sec .",

    "we also discuss global properties of quasienergy states .",
    "next step of our consideration ( sec .",
    "iii(c ) ) is the study of the evolution of the system for different initial conditions and model parameters .",
    "we show that for initial states corresponding to stochastic layer near the separatrix of the coupling resonance , the motion has a diffusion - like character .",
    "we calculate quantum diffusion coefficient and compare it with the classical one .",
    "quantum effects of the dynamical localization and suppression of the classical diffusion are discussed in sec .",
    "iii(d ) . in sec.iv",
    "we give our conclusions by summarizing main results , and shortly discuss possible systems in which the quantum arnold diffusion may be observed .",
    "in this section we discuss main results on the arnold diffusion obtained in @xcite for a classical model .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model describes two nonlinear oscillators coupled by the linear term , and governed by an external force @xmath3 , @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are momentums in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions , and @xmath9 is the coupling constant .",
    "the driving term consists of two harmonics of the same amplitude @xmath10 , @xmath11 with commensurate frequencies , @xmath12 , so that the period is @xmath13 .    without the coupling ( @xmath14 ) and in the absence of the perturbation ( @xmath15 ) , the motion of each oscillator is integrable and",
    "can be found analytically .",
    "the quartic form of the potentials has been chosen in order to have simple analytical expressions in comparison with more realistic models with additional quadratic terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the hamiltonian .",
    "an interesting feature of the system of quartic oscillators is a small contribution of higher harmonics in spite of a strong nonlinearity .",
    "indeed , the solution for @xmath18 has the form ( for details see @xcite ) , @xmath19 } \\over \\cosh{\\bigl[\\pi(n-1/2)\\bigl]}}\\approx\\ ] ] @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the amplitude of oscillations and @xmath22 stands for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "one can see that the amplitude @xmath23 of higher harmonics sharply decreases with an increase of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in action - angle variables @xmath25 one can approximately represent the position of the @xmath26oscillator by the expression @xmath27 .",
    "then the system under consideration is described by the hamiltonian @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    near the _ coupling resonance _",
    "@xmath31 the resonance phase @xmath32 and amplitudes @xmath33 , @xmath34 oscillate .",
    "thus , it is convenient to introduce slow ( @xmath35 ) and fast ( @xmath36 ) phases by making use of the canonical transformation with the generating function , @xmath37 as a result , new actions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are expressed as follows , @xmath40 for the coupling resonance we have @xmath41 , hence , @xmath42 , and the resonance hamiltomian @xmath43 gets the form , @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    the average of eq.([res_ham ] ) over the fast phase @xmath47 gives the pendulum hamiltonian , @xmath48 it defines the frequency @xmath49 of small oscillations of @xmath50 and @xmath38 , @xmath51 and the half - width @xmath52 of the coupling resonance , @xmath53 comparing eqs.([res_ham ] ) and ( [ res_ham_st ] ) , one can understand that the time - dependent perturbation destroys the separatrix of the coupling resonance , and gives rise to a chaotic motion in the vicinity of the separatrix .",
    "specifically , the action @xmath39 reveals a weak arnold diffusion _ along _ the coupling resonance _ inside _ the stochastic layer .",
    "thus , the long - term dynamics we are interested in , is controlled by three resonances , the coupling and two driving ones .",
    "the first - order driving resonances are determined by the condition @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , the coupling resonance @xmath31 serves as a _ guiding resonance _ along which the diffusion takes place .",
    "all three resonances are characterized by their widths , they can overlap with each other if the coupling constant @xmath9 and perturbation strength @xmath10 are large enough . in order to observe the arnold diffusion",
    ", one needs to avoid such an overlap since it leads to a strong _ global chaos_. the condition for the overlap of the resonances reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the half - width of the @xmath59-th driving resonance , @xmath60 . from eqs.([hwc ] ) and ( [ hwd ] ) one can obtain for the overlap , @xmath61 the arnold diffusion occurs in the case when inequality ( [ over-2 ] ) does not satisfy .    in principal ,",
    "the arnold diffusion arises in our model even for one driving resonance .",
    "however , in this case , the rate of the diffusion will be strongly dependent on the distance between the position of a trajectory inside the stochastic layer , and the driving resonance in the frequency space .",
    "instead , for two driving resonances the arnold diffusion is almost homogeneous if one starts in between the two driving resonances .",
    "this simplifies the analytical treatment of the diffusion , that has been performed in refs.@xcite . leaving aside technical details , we briefly comment below the approach used in @xcite .    in order to obtain the diffusion coefficient for a diffusion along the coupling resonance",
    ", one needs to find the change of the total hamiltonian over the half - period of the unperturbed motion near separatrix .",
    "therefore , the diffusion coefficient can be evaluated as follows , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the averaged period of motion within the separatrix layer .",
    "the change of the hamiltonian depends on an initial phase , however , successive values of the phase can be treated as random and independent .",
    "the variation of the total energy is then determined by the sum over many periods for which successive phases can be obtained via the _ separatrix map_. analytical estimates obtained in @xcite , give the following expression for the diffusion coefficient ( in action ) , @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the half - width of chaotic layer of the coupling resonance , that mainly depends on the adiabaticity parameter @xmath66 , with @xmath49 determined by eq.([fr ] ) .",
    "we performed numerical study of the classical arnold diffusion in the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ cl_ham ] ) .",
    "the frequencies of the perturbation ( [ force ] ) were chosen as @xmath67 and @xmath68 resulting in the period @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , @xmath70 which determines the amplitude @xmath71 .",
    "correspondingly , the initial conditions were taken for the system to be in between the two driving resonances .    to put the system inside the stochastic layer of the coupling resonance it is necessary to take @xmath72 . as in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the ratio @xmath73 was taken small enough in order to avoid the overlapping of three first - order resonances ( see eq.([over-2 ] ) ) .",
    "this also suppresses the influence of second - order resonances between unperturbed non - linear motion and the external perturbation .",
    "schematic structure of the coupling resonance is shown in fig.1 .",
    "numerical data are obtained for different initial conditions corresponding to the separatrix layer and to the resonance region of the coupling resonance .",
    "the chaotic region inside the resonance is due to second - order resonances between non - linear motion of the unperturbed hamiltonian and two - frequency perturbation .",
    "the condition of secondary resonances is @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is the frequency of oscillations at the coupling resonance ( near the resonance centre we have @xmath76 ) , and @xmath77 are integers .",
    "one can find that the stochastic region inside the resonance corresponds to @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "as one can see , weak diffusion along the coupling resonance can occur both within the separatrix layer and inside the chaotic region formed by second - order resonances .",
    "the diffusion coefficient was computed as follows , @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the value of the total hamiltonian ( [ cl_ham ] ) , averaged over time intervals @xmath82 of length @xmath83 with @xmath84 . the second average in ( [ dform ] ) has been done in the following way . having the mean value @xmath81 in each interval @xmath82 for a fixed @xmath85 , we computed the difference @xmath86 between adjacent intervals , and averaged the variance @xmath87 over all differences .",
    "this procedure was taken in order to suppress large fluctuations of the energy , and to reveal a stochastic character of motion .",
    "specifically , in the case of a true diffusion , one should expect @xmath88 .",
    "the dependence of diffusion coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 on initial phase @xmath50 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 at @xmath93 is shown in fig.[cl_th_2 ] .",
    "the region close to @xmath94 corresponds to initial conditions inside the separatrix layer , and the interval near @xmath95 corresponds to initial conditions inside the inner stochastic region ( see fig.[diagram ] ) . in",
    "both these regions arnold diffusion coefficients have the same order .",
    "approximate equality @xmath96 indicates here that the motion is really diffusion - like @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", strong difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the region @xmath99 manifests that the dynamics of the system is non - diffusive .",
    "the corresponding quantum model is described by the hamiltonian ( compare with eq.([cl_ham_xy ] ) ) , @xmath100 here @xmath101 and standard relations for momentum and coordinate operators are assumed , @xmath102=-i\\hbar_0 , \\qquad [ \\hat p_y,\\,y]=-i\\hbar_0\\ ] ] with the dimensionless plank constant @xmath103 .    in order to investigate the evolution of the system , first , we have to find stationary eigenstates of the unperturbed ( @xmath15 ) system , corresponding to the vicinity of the coupling resonance @xmath31 . at the second stage , we will use the floquet formalism when considering the time - periodic perturbation for @xmath104 . specifically",
    ", we construct the evolution operator in one period @xmath105 of the perturbation , that allows one to study the dynamics over many periods .",
    "it is naturally to represent stationary states of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath106 , @xmath107 in terms of the eigenstates of uncoupled ( @xmath14 ) nonlinear oscillators , @xmath108 here @xmath109 , @xmath110 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( which will be calculated numerically ) , and the coefficients @xmath113 satisfy to the following stationary schrdinger equation , @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 as eigenvalues of the hamiltonians @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .    at the center of the coupling resonance @xmath117",
    "we have @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 . near to this resonance",
    "it is convenient to expand @xmath121 and @xmath122 in tailor series up to second order terms .",
    "this allows one to introduce new indexes @xmath123 and @xmath124 via the relations @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "then our system ( [ stat eq ] ) can be written in the following form , @xmath127c_{k , p}-\\cr -\\mu\\bigl(\\dots + \\sum_{k ' } x_{k , k'}y_{p - k,-1-k'}\\,c_{k',-1}+ \\bigr.\\cr \\quad\\;\\;\\,+ \\sum_{k ' } x_{k , k'}y_{p - k ,-",

    "\\qquad\\qquad\\;\\:\\ ,     + \\sum_{k ' } x_{k , k'}y_{p - k,1-k'}\\,c_{k',1}+ \\dots \\bigr ) } \\ ] ] with @xmath128 .",
    "one should note that matrix elements @xmath129 and @xmath130 of the coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal to zero for transitions between the states of equal parity .",
    "therefore , the exact solution of the system ( [ system ] ) is characterized by two independent sets of odd and even parity eigenstates ( for odd and even @xmath131 respectively ) .    below we consider the case of a small nonlinearity , @xmath132 this allows us to characterize all states by the group number @xmath133 and by the index @xmath134 that stands for energy levels inside each group .",
    "in fact , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are similar to _ fast _ and _ slow _ classical variables characterizing the motion inside the coupling resonance .",
    "therefore , the energy in each group can be written as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the mathieu - like spectrum of one group .",
    "numerical data for a fragment of the energy spectrum are shown in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "one can see that the spectrum consists of series of energy levels , shifted one from another by the value @xmath137 .",
    "note that the structure of the energy spectrum in each group is typical for a quantum nonlinear resonance @xcite .",
    "lowest levels are practically equidistant with the spacing equal to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the classical frequency of small phase oscillations at the coupling resonance .",
    "accumulation points correspond to classical separatricies , and all energy levels inside separatricies are non - degenerate .",
    "the states slightly above separatricies are quasi - degenerate due to the symmetry of a rotation in opposite directions .",
    "typical structure of eigenstates for different @xmath134 is shown in fig.[func ] .",
    "note that ground states in each group correspond to @xmath140 , and next stationary states , reordered according to the energy increase , are labelled by @xmath141 etc .",
    "the eigenstates inside the resonance are symmetrical with respect to @xmath142 .",
    "one can see that the main maximum corresponds to @xmath143 , although there are small additional maximums at @xmath144 .",
    "the degree of delocalization in the @xmath124-space for eigenstates inside the coupling resonance strongly depends on the energy of eigenstates .",
    "specifically , the closer the energy to that corresponding to the separatrix , the more delocalized is the eigenstate . above the separatrix",
    "all eigenstates are characterized by the maximums of probability located symmetrically with respect to @xmath142 for states @xmath134 and @xmath145 , see fig.[func](c),(d ) .",
    "now we consider the dynamics of our model in the presence of the external two - frequence perturbation acting on the @xmath7-oscillator .",
    "the frequencies @xmath146 and @xmath55 are commensurable , so that the external force is periodic with the period @xmath147 , where @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath59 , @xmath150 are integer .",
    "the initial conditions were taken for the system to be about half - way between the two driving resonances , @xmath151 .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is periodic in time , in accordance with the floquet theory the solution of the non - stationary schrdinger equation can be written in the following form , @xmath152 here @xmath153 is the _ quasienergy function _ with the corresponding _ quasienergy _",
    "( qe ) @xmath154 .",
    "the qe functions and quasienergies are , in fact , the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the evolution operator @xmath155 that describes the evolution of the system within one period of the external perturbation , @xmath156 since we are interested in wave functions only in discrete times @xmath157 with @xmath158 integer , we omitted the argument @xmath159 in eq.([ev_1 ] ) .    in order to construct the evolution operator ,",
    "we represent the qe functions as follows , @xmath160 here the functions @xmath161 are eigenstates of the stationary hamiltonian @xmath106 ( see eq.([hs ] ) ) , and the coefficients @xmath162 are the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath163 in the representation of @xmath106 .",
    "these eigenvectors can be found by a direct diagonalization of the corresponding matrix @xmath164 .    to obtain the matrix @xmath164 we have used the following procedure .",
    "let the evolution operator @xmath163 act on an initial state @xmath165 .",
    "then the wave function @xmath166 at time @xmath105 forms the column of the evolution operator matrix , @xmath167 repetition of this procedure for different initial states @xmath168 allows one to find the whole matrix @xmath169 .",
    "as a result , the wave function @xmath166 can be computed numerically by integration of the nonstationary schrdinger equation in the presence of the time - dependent perturbation , @xmath170 by introducing the slow amplitude @xmath171 via the transformation @xmath172\\ ] ] one can obtain , @xmath173,}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 . in the resonance approximation",
    "we keep in eq.([reson ] ) only the most important slowly oscillating terms with @xmath175 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath176 in eq.([reson ] ) correspond to transitions between the states @xmath134 and @xmath177 from neighbor groups @xmath133 and @xmath178 .",
    "figure [ matr_el ] illustrates relative amplitudes of the matrix elements @xmath179 . in accordance with our numeration of the states , matrix elements at the center of fig.[matr_el ] correspond to transitions between the lowest states in each group , and matrix elements at the corners define the transitions between the states above accumulation points .",
    "the latter elements quickly decrease with an increase of the difference @xmath180 .",
    "the cross at the center of fig.[matr_el ] where matrix elements are relatively large , corresponds to a transition between separatrix states .",
    "the important point is that the transition between such states of neighbor groups ( along the coupling resonance ) is much stronger than those between other states .",
    "this phenomenon is analogous to the quantum diffusion inside a separatrix , which was observed in @xcite for a degenerate hamiltonian system .    as a result ,",
    "numerical procedure for computing the dynamics of our model is as follows .",
    "first , we solve eqs.([reson ] ) and construct the evolution matrix @xmath169 by making use of eq.([change ] ) .",
    "then , direct diagonalization of this matrix yields the eigenvalues @xmath154 and the eigenvectors @xmath162 .",
    "once the eigenvalues @xmath154 and eigenvectors @xmath162 are obtained , one gets the evolution operator for one period , @xmath181 by raising @xmath169 to the @xmath158-th power and using the ortogonality condition for the eigenvectors @xmath162 , one can obtain the evolution operator that propagates the system over @xmath158 periods of the external perturbation , @xmath182      as was shown above , in our model the arnold diffusion occurs along the coupling resonance , or , the same , in @xmath133-space .",
    "this means that a wave packet initially localized at @xmath183 , spreads diffusively in time . in order to observe this dynamics , below",
    "we introduce specific variables that characterize global structure of wave packets .",
    "but , first , we discuss the structure of qe eigenstates ( in terms of these new variables ) since it helps us to understand the mechanism of quantum arnold diffusion .    in the @xmath133-space",
    "each of qe functions @xmath162 can be globally characterized by the ",
    "mean position \" @xmath184 and by the variance @xmath185 determined as follows @xcite , @xmath186 then , it is convenient to plot @xmath184 versus @xmath187 for all eigenfunctions , see fig.[cluvs ] . for small values of the coupling @xmath9 ,",
    "see fig.[cluvs](a ) , the qe functions have a very small variance that means a strong localization in the @xmath133-space .",
    "more details are seen in fig.[cluvs](b ) which shows a magnified fragment of fig.[cluvs](a ) .",
    "one can see different groups of qe functions , characterizing specific relations between @xmath184 and @xmath187 .",
    "first group consists of those eigenstates whose energies are close to the ground state ( with a very small variance , @xmath188 ) .",
    "another group is characterized by an irregular dependence of @xmath184 on @xmath187 ( region ( 1 ) in fig.[cluvs](b ) ) .",
    "the states which belong to this group are chaotic separtrix eigenstates .",
    "regular dependences @xmath189 for @xmath190 correspond to under - separatrix states with @xmath191 and @xmath192 . for very large @xmath134",
    "this regular structure is destroyed due to the influence of two driving resonances ( not shown in fig.[cluvs](b ) ) .",
    "irregular spread of points in the region ( 2 ) reflects chaos in the inner region of the coupling resonance , that arises due to two secondary resonances @xmath193 . with an increase of @xmath9 ( see fig.[cluvs](c ) )",
    ", the regular structure of qe functions disappears .",
    "this means that many of eigenstates are chaotic .",
    "however , the variance @xmath185 remains limited , thus , demonstrating that in the @xmath133 direction the eigenstates are _",
    "localized_. the fact that many points in fig.[cluvs](c ) are distributed incidentally , should be treated as the manifestation of quantum chaos .",
    "now we discuss numerical results for the dynamics of our model .",
    "the evolution of any initial state @xmath194 can be computed using the evolution matrix @xmath195 , @xmath196 we repeat again that our numerical data refer to the regime when the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are small enough , so that main three resonances are not overlapped .",
    "quantum dynamics for different initial conditions is shown in fig.[comp ] .",
    "here we show typical dependencies of the variance of the energy @xmath197 in normalized units , versus time @xmath159 measured in the number @xmath158 of periods of the external perturbation . the quantity @xmath198 is defined similar to that for the qe eigenstates , @xmath199 where @xmath200 .",
    "the data clearly show a different character of the evolution for three initial states taken from below and above the separatrix , as well as from the separatrix layer . for the states taken from the center of the resonance and well above the separatrix , the variance @xmath201 quasi - periodically oscillates , in contrast with the separatrix state . in the latter case , after a short stochastization time the variance of the energy increases linearly in time , thus manifesting a diffusion - like spread of the wave packet .",
    "more results are presented in fig.[dyn ] where a diffusion - like increase of the energy is shown for separatrix initial states and different values of @xmath9 .",
    "one can see that linear increase of the variance @xmath202 is typical , and it occurs after a short time which is associated with the time of a fast spread of packet over the separatrix layer in transverse direction .",
    "such a behaviour is typical for the classical arnold diffusion .",
    "the data allows one to determine the diffusion coefficient as @xmath203 , by making use the fit to a linear dependence @xmath202 for @xmath204 .",
    "we have calculated separately quantum and classical diffusion coefficients and found that the quantum arnold diffusion roughly corresponds to the classical one . however",
    ", the data clearly indicate that the quantum diffusion is systematically weaker than the classical arnold diffusion , see fig.[coeff ] .",
    "one should stress that the quantum arnold diffusion takes places only in the case when the number @xmath205 of energy stationary states in the separatrix layer is relatively large .",
    "for the first time , this point was noted by shuryak @xcite who studied the quantum - classical correspondence for nonlinear resonances . in this connection",
    "we have to estimate the number of the energy states that occupy the separatrix layer .",
    "however , it is a problem to make reliable analytical estimates of the width of the separatrix layer for our model . as was shown in @xcite , in the case of many - frequency perturbation , secondary resonances play the dominant role in the formation of chaos in a separatrix layer . indeed , as was shown above , the role of such resonances is quite strong in our case of the two - frequency perturbation .",
    "for this reason , we have performed a direct numerical calculation of the width of stochastic separatrix layer for the classical hamiltonian , and used these results in order to estimate the number of separatrix energy levels in the corresponding energy interval .",
    "we have found that for @xmath206 the number @xmath205 of stationary states in the separatrix chaotic layer is more than 10 , therefore , one can speak about a kind of stochastization in this region . on the other hand , with a decrease of the coupling",
    "( see data in fig.[coeff ] for @xmath207 ) , the number @xmath205 decreases and for @xmath208 it is of the order one . for this reason",
    "the last right point in fig.[coeff ] corresponds to the situation when classical chaotic motion along the coupling resonance is completely suppressed by quantum effects ( the so - called  shuryak border \" @xcite ) .",
    "since the diffusive motion along the coupling resonance is effectively one - dimensional , one can naturally expect the anderson - like localization .",
    "we have already noted that the variance of qe eigenstates of the evolution operator is finite in the @xmath133-space .",
    "this means that eigenstates are localized , and the wave packet dynamics in this direction has to reveal the saturation of the diffusion .",
    "more specifically , we expect that the linear increase of the variance of the energy ceases , after some characteristic time .",
    "this effect known as the _ dynamical localization _ , has been discovered in @xcite for the kicked rotor , and was studied later in different physical models ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one should note that the dynamical localization is , in principle , different from the anderson localization , since the latter occurs for models with random potentials .",
    "in contrast , the dynamical localization happens in dynamical ( without any randomness ) systems , and is due to interplay between ( week ) classical diffusion and ( strong ) quantum effects .    in order to observe the dynamical localization in our model ( along the coupling resonance inside the separatrix layer ) , one needs to study long - time dynamics of wave packets .",
    "our numerical study for large times @xmath209 have revealed that after some time @xmath210 , the diffusionlike evolution stops for all range of coupling parameter @xmath9 .",
    "instead , for larger times , the variance @xmath198 starts to oscillate around the mean value @xmath211 .",
    "period of such oscillations depends on @xmath9 non - monotonically and vary from @xmath212 to @xmath213 .",
    "two examples of such a long - time dynamics are given in fig.[limit ] .",
    "one can argue that the localization length is of the order of the width of wave packet after the saturation of the diffusion @xcite .",
    "therefore , the localization length @xmath214 can be associated with the square root of @xmath211 .",
    "we have numerically found the exponential dependence @xmath211 on @xmath215 , see fig.[localiz ] .",
    "this result is not surprising because @xmath216 is proportional to @xmath215 ( see fig.[coeff ] ) and @xmath217 is practically independent on @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that the spread of packets in @xmath124 and @xmath218 space occurs even without the coupling between two resonances , due to the influence of the time - dependent perturbation ( see section iii - a ) .",
    "for this reason one should compare this spread to that determined by the arnold diffusion .",
    "our additional study clearly show that these two effects are very different , see fig.[decreas ] .    here",
    ", we plotted the profile @xmath219 of the wave packet after the saturation , versus the group number @xmath133 .",
    "this figure demonstrates the main effect of the arnold diffusion along the coupling resonance .",
    "one can see that in all cases there is an exponential localization of packets in the @xmath133-space .",
    "this allows to introduce the localization length defined from the decrease of the probability in the tails of packets .",
    "the data illustrate a strong increase of the localization length in the presence of the coupling between two oscillators , in comparison with the case of completely independent oscillators for @xmath14 ( @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) .",
    "we have studied the hamiltonian system of two coupled nonlinear oscillators , one of which is under the influence of the time - dependent perturbation with two commensurate frequencies . in the classical description , the separatrix of the coupling resonance is destroyed due to the perturbation , and the arnold diffusion occurs along this resonance inside a narrow stochastic layer .",
    "our numerical data performed for the quantum analog of the system , allow us to make the following conclusions about the properties of the quantum arnold diffusion .    by studying the quasienergy eigenstates of the evolution operator",
    ", we have found an irregular structure of those eigenstates which correspond to the stochastic layer .",
    "these eigenstates turned out to be exponentially localized along the coupling resonance , with the localization length , strongly enhanced in comparison with the case of non - coupled oscillators .",
    "the study of wave packet dynamics for different initial states have revealed a diffusion - like spread of packets along the coupling resonance , if initial states correspond to the stochastic layer .",
    "we have found that the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on model parameters , roughly follows the classical dependence . however , the quantum diffusion is systematically slower than the classical one .",
    "this fact is obviously due to the influence of quantum effects .",
    "it should be stressed that the quantum arnold diffusion occurs in a deep semiclassical region , specifically , for the case when the number @xmath205 of chaotic eigenstates inside the stohastic layer is sufficiently large ( of the order of 10 or larger ) . with a decrease of the coupling parameter ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient strongly decreases , and for @xmath222 the diffusion disappears .",
    "therefore , we can see how strong quantum effects destroy the diffusive dynamics of wave packets .",
    "another manifestation of quantum effects is the dynamical localization that persists even for large @xmath205 .",
    "specifically , we have observed that the quantum diffusion occurs only for finite ( although large ) times . on a larger time",
    "scale the diffusion ceases , and after some characteristic time it terminates .",
    "this effect is similar to that discovered in the kicked rotor model @xcite and studied later in other physical systems ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , in our case the dynamical localization arises for a weak chaos inside the separatrix layer , in contrast to previous models with a strong ( global ) chaos in the classical description .",
    "our results may find a confirmation in experiments on one - electron dynamics in 2d semiconductor quantum billiards , where the charged particle motion is determined by the hamiltonian of the type ( [ ham ] ) , ( [ hath^0_x ] ) .",
    "it is also possible that the quantum arnold diffusion occurs in nuclear dynamics of complex molecules , driven by laser fields @xcite .",
