    "the characterization of correlations in composite open quantum systems is essential for quantum information and computation tasks@xcite . to a specific property of the system it can be made to correspond a type of correlation that is used to define the property itself .",
    "in fact , entanglement represents correlations related to non - separability of the state of a composite quantum system ; violation of bell inequalities@xcite represents quantum nonlocality , that is correlations not reproducible by any local classical model ; quantum discord ( entropic@xcite and geometric@xcite ) represents quantumness and indicators of purely classical correlations can also be defined .",
    "each of these types of correlations can be useful for specific tasks .",
    "for example , entanglement is the main resource for teleportation and superdense coding@xcite , nonlocal correlations guarantee secure quantum cryptography@xcite , entropic discord is a resource for deterministic one - qubit computation@xcite and geometric discord for remote state preparation@xcite .",
    "the above correlations , each linked to a specific property of bipartite quantum systems , have been extended to multipartite systems and quantified in terms of distances between the state of the system and its closest states without that property@xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to understand , in a given open system , the dynamics of the various correlations and in particular how much and for how long they persist .",
    "the dynamical behavior of correlations present in a composite open quantum system strongly depend on the noise produced by the surrounding environment . in this sense one of the most important aspects of the environment",
    "is if it can be described either as memoryless ( markovian ) or as with memory ( non - markovian ) .",
    "the characterization of the environment as markovian or non - markovian , with respect to a given system , is determined by the ratio between its typical correlation time and the system relaxation time . for two - qubit systems in markovian environments ,",
    "some kind of correlations may be subject to early - stage disappearance ( esd , or sudden death ) , meaning that they completely disappear at a finite time in spite of exponential decay of single - qubit coherence .",
    "this has been shown , both theoretically and experimentally , in the case of entanglement@xcite and of bell inequality violations@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon strongly limits the time when correlations can be usefully exploited .",
    "differently , two - qubit systems in structured non - markovian environments may present phenomena such as revivals@xcite and trapping@xcite of correlations , thus overcoming esd .",
    "the study of the dynamics of correlations under non - markovian noise thus appears to be fundamental for quantum information purposes@xcite and it shall be the main subject of this paper .    in particular , the aim of this review is to summarize some of the most recent results on the dynamics of correlations in bipartite qubit systems embedded in specific non - markovian environments .",

    "we now review the main features of entanglement dynamics when two noninteracting qubits are embedded in a common non - markovian bosonic environment ( see right part of fig .",

    "( [ spectraldensity ] ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "the exact , and therefore non - markovian , analytical expression for the amplitudes @xmath110 has been derived . using these quantities",
    ", one can readily calculate the time evolution of entanglement , as measured by concurrence , which for our system is simply given by @xmath111 .",
    "an interesting feature of the dynamics is the existence of a non - zero stationary value of @xmath112 due to the entanglement of the decoherence - free state @xmath113 .",
    "the maximum stationary entanglement @xmath114 is obtained for initially factorized states .    for weak couplings and/or bad cavity and for an initially separable state ,",
    "the concurrence increases monotonically up to its stationary value ; whereas , for initially entangled states , the concurrence first goes to zero before increasing towards @xmath115 .",
    "the strong coupling / good cavity case is more rich and presents entanglement oscillations and revival phenomena for every initial atomic states .",
    "one can prove that for maximally entangled initial states the revivals have maximum amplitude when only one of the two atoms is effectively coupled to the cavity field , i.e. for @xmath116 .",
    "this revivals are similar to those present in the independent environments case discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : inden ] , as they are also due to the reservoir memory effect .",
    "however , in the case of common environment the revivals are enhanced and the amount of revived entanglement is huge , being comparable to the previous maximum .    based on this dynamics , a detailed analysis of the experimental implementation of cavity - mediated entanglement generation in the context of trapped ion cavity qed has been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the rich dynamics of the system , showing quantum beats and other truly nonclassical phenomena , has been studied in the off - resonant regime in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , it has been demonstrated that the loss of entanglement can be completely suppressed by a series of appropriate projective measurements , a consequence of the quantum zeno effect@xcite .",
    "let us now consider the case in which two excitations are initially present in the system . in this case",
    "the derivation of the exact analytical solution is more complicated . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that two identical atoms interact resonantly with a lorentzian structured reservoir with equal coupling . in ref.@xcite it has been shown that , by using the pseudomode approach@xcite and establishing a connection with a three - level ladder system , it is still possible to solve the dynamics without performing any approximations .",
    "armed with the exact solution we can prove that esd and entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) phenomena occur in the non - markovian common reservoir scenario@xcite .",
    "entanglement sudden death and entanglement revivals are basically due to two combined and intertwined effects : the backaction of the structured reservoir and the reservoir - mediated interaction between the qubits . in order to understand the role played by each of these effects it is useful to compare the dynamics with the cases of the common markovian reservoir , and two independent non - markovian reservoirs .    in a common markovian reservoir",
    "a period of complete disentanglement is followed by a revival of entanglement , but no oscillations are present .",
    "such a revival is due to the action of the common reservoir which tends to create quantum correlations between the qubits , providing an effective coupling between them .",
    "the feedback of information from the reservoir into the system , characterizing the non - markovian dynamics , enhances the appearance of esd regions , since it tends to recreate the conditions that led to the first esd period .",
    "a comparison between the non - markovian independent and common reservoir cases reveals that , for the same type of reservoir spectrum , esd ( dark periods ) regions are much wider in the independent reservoirs case than in the common reservoir case .",
    "since both cases take into account memory effects , this suggests that the reservoir - mediated interaction between the qubits , in the common reservoir scenario , effectively counters the fast disappearance of entanglement .",
    "non - markovian effects also influence strongly the dynamics for initially factorized states , when the reservoir - mediated interaction between the qubits leads to entanglement generation .",
    "while , for independent reservoirs , sudden birth of entanglement does not appear , for the common reservoir case , esb does occur . moreover , in a structured reservoir such a phenomenon presents new interesting features , compared to the markovian case . in general , the reservoir memory prolongs the initial disentanglement . in this case",
    ", therefore , the reservoir backaction dominates over the tendency of the common reservoir to create entanglement between the qubits .",
    "esb periods and disentanglement revivals become more frequent and numerous for stronger non - markovian conditions .",
    "strategies for preventing the decay of quantum correlations , initially present in a composite quantum system , and thus to fight decoherence are important for effective realization of quantum computers .",
    "some of these strategies , applied to a single qubit , are quantum error correction@xcite , dynamical decoupling of the quantum system from its environment@xcite or quantum zeno effect@xcite .",
    "all of these procedures require external controls .",
    "it has been then shown that entanglement protection is possible by dynamical decoupling based on nonlocal pulses@xcite and by zeno effect on qubits in a common bosonic reservoir@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another possible way to reduce the detrimental effect of the environment , without using external controls , could consist in embedding the qubits in suitably structured environments where , for example , population trapping is achievable .",

    "a huge deal of attention has been devoted to the dynamics of correlations other than entanglement in presence of both markovian@xcite and non - markovian@xcite quantum environments . for a comprehensive review on quantum discord",
    "we refer to ref.@xcite . in general quantum discord",
    "is more robust than entanglement against decoherence , and it does not present sudden death phenomena .",
    "a peculiar aspect of the dynamics of quantum discord is that it may remain frozen for finite time intervals@xcite even in presence of decoherence , as also proven in an all - optical experimental setup@xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been very recently theoretically demonstrated that , for non - markovian dephasing , quantum discord can be eternally frozen or time invariant@xcite .",
    "this new phenomenon is indeed quite unique , as discord is the only nonclassical property which may remain constant in time in presence of decoherence even when the state of the system evolves due to the interaction with the environment . if , as several studies strongly indicates , quantum discord is a resource for certain quantum technologies , its time invariant properties might play an important role .",
    "the physical system under investigation consists of two qubits under local dephasing channels .",
    "let us assume that the qubits , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are prepared in a state of the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the pauli operator in direction @xmath93 acting on @xmath145 , @xmath146 is a real number , such that @xmath147 for every @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the identity operator of the total system . for a dephasing channel subjected to either white or colored noise the form of the state",
    "is maintained during the evolution . in the case of white noise",
    "the markovian dissipator takes the form @xmath150=\\gamma [ \\sigma^{a(b)}_j \\rho_{a(b ) } \\sigma_j^{a(b ) } - \\rho_{a(b)}]/2 $ ] , with @xmath151 the phase damping rate , and @xmath152 for the bit , bit - phase , and phase flip cases , respectively . for certain classes of states",
    "the discord does not decay at all , until a finite transition time @xmath153 .",
    "the system indeed experiences two different dynamical regimes : at the beginning the state of the qubits evolves in a way to lose only classical correlations while quantum correlations are not touched in any way by decoherence .",
    "this is what we call the classical decoherence regime . in the second phase , after a sudden change in quantum and classical correlations ,",
    "quantum correlations are lost while classical correlations are preserved .",
    "this is the quantum decoherence phase .",
    "this effect was named sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence .    when the two quits are subjected to local colored noise dephasing channels one needs to use a memory - kernel master equation to study the dynamics of each qubit subjected to random telegraphic noise@xcite . in this case , for certain states and regimes of parameters , one can distinguish two different behaviours for the dynamics of the quantum correlation : the frozen behaviour , and the sudden change dynamics .",
    "in the first case the dynamics displays multiple sudden transitions : as in the markovian case , classical correlation at first decreases while the discord remains constant then at a sudden transition point classical correlation becomes constant and discord oscillates , and then again discord becomes constant while classical correlation oscillates .",
    "in the second case first both classical and quantum correlations decrease until , at a sudden change point , classical correlations become constant while quantum correlations exhibit a discontinuous change in the amplitude of the damped oscillations . at the following sudden change point",
    "classical correlation starts again to oscillate and quantum discord changes back to its previous rate of oscillation .",
    "this behavior reflects the presence of memory effects characterizing the dynamics .",
    "here we treat the case when environments are classical , where back - action is absent .",
    "one would expect that if the quantum environment of a quantum system is modelled as classical , for example a classical light field coupled to a quantized atom , then there might be qualities of the dynamics that this model is unable to describe . intuitively , one might expect that since a classical environment should not be able to store quantum correlations in the same way as a quantum environment , the capability to describe revivals of quantum correlations might be affected . similarly , if the environment has no back - action on the system , then it would seem that this could also affect the correlation dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , revivals of entanglement can occur for random classical telegraph noise@xcite , for atoms subject either to local phase - noisy lasers@xcite or to random external classical fields@xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to exactly know how correlation dynamics behaves when an environment is modelled as classical instead of quantum , or when back - action on the system is not present .",
    "we now briefly review a recent result@xcite that tries to explain how and why revivals of correlations , including quantum correlations , can generally occur also if the environment is classical , and when no back - action is present .",
    "we illustrate our discussion with a model characterized by the absence of correlations induced by back - action , where the element of randomness is introduced in a very simple way .",
    "the example we consider is a pair of independent qubits driven by single classical field modes with random phase , where it has been shown that revivals of correlations do occur both for entanglement , for the so - called quantum discord , and for classical correlations@xcite .",
    "the dynamical map for the single qubit @xmath42 is of the random external fields type@xcite and can be written as @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the time evolution operator with @xmath156 and the factor @xmath157 arises from the equal field phase probabilities of the model ( more in general , there is a probability @xmath158 associated to @xmath159 ) .",
    "each hamiltonian @xmath160 is expressed in the rotating frame at the qubit - field resonant frequency @xmath161 . in the basis @xmath162",
    ", the time evolution operators @xmath163 have the matrix form @xmath164 where @xmath165 with @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this simple model is depicted in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : randomexternalfields ] , where the two local environments are realized by two single classical field modes of the same frequency and amplitude , but each passing across a random dephaser such that the phase of the field at the location of each qubit is either zero or @xmath168 , with probability @xmath169 .",
    "the interaction between each qubit and its local field mode is assumed to be strong enough so that , for sufficiently long times , the dissipation effects of the vacuum radiation modes on the qubit dynamics can be neglected .",
    "the dynamics is cyclic , as follows from the unitary matrix of eq .",
    "( [ unitarymatrix ] ) ( for each @xmath165 ) becoming the identity for times @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the same initial state is thus retrieved at these times . if one takes into account dissipation effects on the system , the dynamics would not be cyclic anymore , but it is expected that for dissipation weak enough the qualitative behavior of the dynamics would remain the same until a characteristic time .    the global dynamical map @xmath172 applied to an initial state @xmath173 of the bipartite system , @xmath174 , is again of the random external fields type , that is , @xmath175 this map @xmath172 moves inside the class of bell - diagonal states , that are mixture of the four bell states . given a state @xmath176 , we adopt the definitions@xcite of entanglement @xmath177 and quantum discord @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the relative entropy , @xmath180 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are , respectively , the classical state and the separable state closest to @xmath176 .",
    "these quantities can be analytically calculated for bell - diagonal states .",
    "right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : randomexternalfields ] displays the dynamics of entanglement @xmath183 and discord @xmath184 starting from the bell - diagonal state @xmath185 .",
    "collapses and revivals of entanglement occur , as is known to happen for independent non - markovian bosonic environments acting as amplitude damping channels@xcite .",
    "quantum discord also decreases and increases during the dynamics , vanishing only at given times . in presence of small dissipation ,",
    "the same qualitative behavior of correlations is expected , that is , partial revivals should still occur when the dissipation effects are weak enough .",
    "the above revivals of quantum correlations , as characterized by entanglement and discord , occur without transfer of correlations induced by back - action from system to environment .",
    "the absence of back - action implies that the initial two - qubit correlations can not be  temporarily stored \" as correlations entirely within the environments .",
    "this differs from the point of view where revivals are interpreted in terms of transfer of correlations induced by back - action which correlate the independent non - markovian quantum environments , which in turn again re - correlate the qubits@xcite . in our example",
    "this mechanism is absent .",
    "these revivals can be instead explained in terms of correlations in a classical - quantum state between qubits and environments@xcite .",
    "the environments itself play an important role through the classical record they keep memory of what operation has been applied to the qubits .",
    "finally , it has been also shown that these revivals can be interpreted by referring only to the intrinsic features of the two - qubit dynamics , by showing that they are connected with the increase of a quantifier of non - markovianity@xcite of the single - qubit dynamics .",
    "the reduced dynamics of a system interacting with a non - markovian environment can be characterized by relevant memory effects . in this non - markovian regime",
    ", correlations present in a composite system may evolve in ways which can be exploited in applications requiring their presence . in this paper",
    ", we have reviewed some recent results concerning the characterization of different kinds of correlations in non - markovian environments .    in a first part of this review ,",
    "we have discussed the phenomenon of entanglement revivals . in the case of two non - interacting qubits initially prepared in an entangled state and subject to local markovian noise , in front of an exponential decay of single qubit coherences , entanglement may disappear in a finite time .",
    "differently , in the case of non - markovian environments , it has been shown theoretically and experimentally that entanglement may revive also after finite time intervals when it is absent , because of the memory effects in the two - qubit dynamics .    following this result , as a possible strategy for preventing the decay of quantum correlations , we have discussed on the possibility to exploit at the maximum non - markovian effects to protect entanglement from noise . in the case of qubits embedded in photonic crystals",
    ", entanglement may be preserved for arbitrary long times , phenomenon due to the direct link between the dynamics of entanglement and that of the excited state population of each qubit ; indeed in a photonic - band gap material , spontaneous emission of a qubit may be inhibited and population trapping may occur , as observed for example in the case of quantum dots .    in the final part we have also discussed recent results concerning the occurrence of revival of correlations also in the case of classical environments such that back - action on the system is absent .",
    "the mechanism at the basis of these revivals appears to be connected to the memory effects in the reduced dynamics and is linked to a subtle mechanism that the environment itself can play through the classical record they keep memory of what operation has been applied to the qubits .",
    "this occurs even if the classical environments can not store any quantum correlations on their own , and they do not become entangled with their respective quantum systems .",
