    "in the central regions of disk galaxies , we often find intense star formation activities ( e.g. , @xcite ) where not only the star formation rates ( sfrs ) but also the star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) , defined as the fraction of the sfr surface density in the surface mass density of molecular gas , are also enhanced .",
    "these star formation activities are referred to as starburst phenomena , which are different from the star formations in the disk regions of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the starburst phenomena are prominent not only because they show high sfrs but also because they show elevated sfes .",
    "what causes these `` high sfe '' star formations ?",
    "in other words , why do sfes differ among galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or within locations / regions in a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) ?",
    "since stars are formed by the contraction of molecular gas , which would be initiated by gravitational instability and/or cloud - cloud collision of molecular clouds , it can be easily expected that some properties of molecular gas play a key role in controlling the variations of sfes .",
    "investigations of molecular gas are widely performed using co(@xmath11 ) emission , which traces the total mass of molecular gas . in particular , extensive surveys or mappings of co(@xmath11 ) emission toward galaxies",
    "are examined ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , co(@xmath11 ) emission simultaneously traces both diffuse / cold molecular gas and dense / warm molecular gas , which is directly linked to star formation .",
    "therefore , co(@xmath11 ) emission is useful to determine the total amount of molecular gas , but it is difficult to compare with sfes quantitatively .",
    "thus , it is essential to study _ dense _ molecular gas , because stars are formed from the dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "in fact , recent studies of the dense molecular medium in galaxies based on the observations of hcn(@xmath11 ) emission , a dense molecular gas tracer ( @xmath15 @xmath16 a few @xmath17 @xmath18 ) due to its large dipole moment ( @xmath19 debye , whereas @xmath20 debye ) , demonstrate the intimate connection between dense molecular gas and massive star formation in galaxies .",
    "for example , after the first report by @xcite , a tight correlation between hcn(@xmath11 ) and fir continuum luminosities has been shown among many galaxies including nearby ones ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and high redshift quasar host galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that sfes are governed by the fraction of dense molecular gas to the total amount of molecular contents traced by the hcn(@xmath11)/co(@xmath11 ) intensity ratios ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a spatial coincidence between dense molecular gas traced by hcn(@xmath11 ) and massive star forming regions was also reported ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    however , hcn(@xmath11 ) emission is often too weak to trace a wide - area map in the disk regions of galaxies .",
    "hcn(@xmath11 ) intensity is typically 1020 times lower than the co(@xmath11 ) intensity in the disk regions of the galaxy @xcite and galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , hcn(@xmath11 ) emission is mainly used to measure the amount of dense molecular gas in the central regions of galaxies or to obtain information integrated over the whole regions of galaxies due to inadequate sensitivity of current observing facilities ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    instead , co(@xmath0 ) emission is a promising probe of dense molecular clouds even in the disk regions of galaxies . the critical density for co(@xmath0 )",
    "transition is a few @xmath2 @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the co(@xmath0 ) emission can also trace the dense component of molecular clouds as well as hcn(@xmath11 ) .",
    "in fact , in the central regions of nearby star forming galaxies , a tight correlation between co(@xmath0 ) and h@xmath23 luminosities , which is better than the correlation between co(@xmath11 ) and h@xmath23 luminosities , has been reported @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite discovered a trend that co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath11 ) ratios , hereafter referred to as @xmath12 , increase with the sfe in infrared - luminous galaxies , which is very similar to a finding based on hcn(@xmath11)/co(@xmath11 ) ratios ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there seem to be detectable amounts of co(@xmath0 ) emitting dense gas in the disk regions of galaxies such as m 51 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , m 31 @xcite , ngc 6946 @xcite , and antennae galaxies @xcite , where the co(@xmath0 ) intensities are found to be comparable to the co(@xmath11 ) intensities .",
    "these results clearly indicate a potential for the use of co(@xmath0 ) emission as a dense gas tracer in the disk regions of galaxies .",
    "spatially - resolved wide - area co(@xmath0 ) observations of nearby galaxies are also essential for the appropriate interpretations of high-@xmath24 co observations of high redshift objects ( see a review by @xcite ) , because most of these high-@xmath24 co observations of distant objects are spatially unresolved .",
    "previous co(@xmath0 ) observations of nearby galaxies , however , were almost limited to their central regions or to the whole regions of galaxies without resolving the structures using a large observing beam ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present wide - area observations of co(@xmath0 ) line emission using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; @xcite , @xcite ) towards the whole inner disk of m  83 ( ngc 5236 ) .",
    "m  83 is a nearby , face - on , barred , grand - design spiral galaxy hosting an intense starburst at its center .",
    "the distance to m  83 is estimated to be 4.5 mpc @xcite ; therefore , 1@xmath25 corresponds to 22 pc .",
    "the inclination of m  83 is @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "its proximity and face - on view enable us to resolve its major structures such as the nuclear starburst region , bar , and inner spiral arms even by single - dish observations at millimeter or submillimeter wavelength . for these reasons , m  83 is the best target to investigate the spatial variations of sfe and the physical state of the molecular gas between the nuclear region and the disk region .",
    "the co observations toward m  83 were reported for various transitions ( see a comprehensive summary in @xcite ) . @xcite present a co(@xmath11 ) map of the nucleus and the bar at a resolution of @xmath27 using a nobeyama 45-m telescope . a new wider co(@xmath11 ) map using the nobeyama 45-m telescope is now available @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite present co(@xmath11 ) and co(@xmath28 ) maps covering the entire optical disk .",
    "however , the high-@xmath24 co line observations such as co(@xmath0 ) were still limited to the nuclear region and the bar ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    the goals of this paper are ( 1 ) to depict the global distribution of co(@xmath0 ) line emission or dense molecular gas in the disk region of m  83 , ( 2 ) to investigate the spatial variations of @xmath12 within the disk of m  83 , by computing the radial profiles of co(@xmath0 ) and co(@xmath11 ) intensities , and ( 3 ) to examine the correlation of the @xmath12 values and sfes through a comparison of the radial profiles .",
    "in particular , we focus on the difference of properties of the nuclear starburst and star formation in the disk region . further analysis of our co(@xmath0 ) data of m  83 will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "co(@xmath0 ) observations towards m  83 were performed using the aste from december 2004 to january 2005 , and june 2005 .",
    "the size of the co(@xmath0 ) map is about @xmath29 ( @xmath30 kpc ) , including the nuclear starburst region , the bar , and the inner spiral arms .",
    "we set the grid spacing to 11@xmath25 , except for the inter - arm region where the grid spacing was set to 22@xmath25 .",
    "we set the position angle of the major axis to 45@xmath31 @xcite .",

    "the receiver sc345 was plugged into the single cartridge dewar of the aste , which is based on the design of the alma test cryostat ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) using a 3-stage gifford mcmahon cryocooler with an he pot for temperature stabilization .",
    "a nb - based parallel - connected twin - junction - type mixer is mounted on the 4 k stage of the dewar with a corrugated feed horn and a local oscillator ( lo ) signal coupler to inject radio - frequency ( rf ) and lo signals into the receiver .",

    "both the attenuation of the lo signal power and the change in the frequency setting without a phase lock loop of gunn oscillator easily facilitate fully remote operations of the receiver system .",
