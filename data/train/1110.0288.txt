    "shallow - water equations have been proposed by adhmar barr de saint - venant in 1871 to model flows in a channel @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "they are widely used to model flows in various contexts , such as : overland flow @xcite , rivers @xcite , flooding @xcite , dam breaks @xcite , nearshore @xcite , tsunami @xcite .",
    "these equations consist in a nonlinear system of partial differential equations ( pde - s ) , more precisely conservation laws describing the evolution of the height and mean velocity of the fluid .    in real situations ( realistic geometry , sharp spatial or temporal variations of the parameters in the model , etc .",
    ") , there is no hope to solve explicitly this system of pde - s , _",
    "i.e. _ to produce analytic formul  for the solutions .",
    "it is therefore necessary to develop specific numerical methods to compute approximate solutions of such pde - s , see for instance @xcite .",
    "implementation of any of such methods raises the question of the validation of the code .",
    "validation is an essential step to check if a model ( that is the equations , the numerical methods and their implementation ) suitably describes the considered phenomena .",
    "there exists at least three complementary types of numerical tests to ensure a numerical code is relevant for the considered systems of equations .",
    "first , one can produce convergence or stability results ( _ e.g. _ by refining the mesh ) .",
    "this validates only the numerical method and its implementation .",
    "second , approximate solutions can be matched to analytic solutions available for some simplified or specific cases .",
    "finally , numerical results can be compared with experimental data , produced indoor or outdoor .",
    "this step should be done after the previous two ; it is the most difficult one and must be validated by a specialist of the domain .",
    "this paper focuses on the second approach .",
    "analytic solutions seem underused in the validation of numerical codes , possibly for the following reasons .",
    "first , each analytic solution has a limited scope in terms of flow conditions .",
    "second , they are currently scattered through the literature and , thus , are difficult to find .",
    "however , there exists a significant number of published analytic solutions that encompasses a wide range of flow conditions .",
    "hence , this gives a large potential to analytic solutions for validatation of numerical codes .",
    "this work aims at overcoming these issues , on the one hand by gathering a significant set of analytic solutions , on the other hand by providing the corresponding source codes .",
    "the present paper describes the analytic solutions together with some comments about their interest and use .",
    "the source codes are made freely available to the community through the swashes ( shallow - water analytic solutions for hydraulic and environmental studies ) software .",
    "the swashes library does not pretend to list all available analytic solutions . on the contrary , it is open for extension and we take here the opportunity to ask users to contribute to the project by sending other analytic solutions together with the dedicated code .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : eq ] , we briefly present the notations we use and the main properties of shallow - water equations .",
    "in the next two sections , we briefly outline each analytic solution",
    ". a short description of the swashes software can be find in section [ sec : swashes ] .",
    "the final section is an illustration using the results of the shallow - water code developed by our team for a subset of analytic solutions .",
    "first we describe the rather general settings of viscous shallow - water equations in two space dimensions , with topography , rain , infiltration and soil friction . in the second paragraph , we give the simplified system arising in one space dimension and recall several classical properties of the equations .",
    "the unknowns of the equations are the water height ( @xmath0 [ l ] ) and @xmath1 , @xmath2 the horizontal components of the vertically averaged velocity [ l / t ] ( figure  [ fignot2d ] ) .",
    "the equations take the following form of balance laws , where @xmath3 m / s@xmath4 is the gravity constant : @xmath5 the first equation is actually a mass balance .",
    "the fluid density can be replaced by the height because of incompressibility .",
    "the other two equations are momentum balances , and involve forces such as gravity and friction .",
    "we give now a short description of all the terms involved , recalling the physical dimensions .",
    "* @xmath6 is the topography [ l ] , since we consider no erosion here , it is a fixed function of space , @xmath7 , and we classically denote by @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) the opposite of the slope in the @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) direction , @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) ; * @xmath14 is the rain intensity [ l / t ] , it is a given function @xmath15 . in this paper",
    ", it is considered uniform in space ; * @xmath16 is the infiltration rate [ l / t ] , mentioned for the sake of completeness .",
    "it is given by another model ( such as green - ampt , richards , etc . ) and is not taken into account in the following ; * @xmath17 is the friction force .",
    "the friction law @xmath18 may take several forms , depending on both soil and flow properties . in the formul  below",
    ", @xmath19 is the velocity vector @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the discharge @xmath23 . in hydrological models ,",
    "two families of friction laws are encountered , based on empirical considerations . on the one hand , we have the family of manning - strickler s friction laws @xmath24 @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the manning s coefficient [ l^-1/3^t ] .",
    "+ on the other hand , the laws of darcy - weisbach s and chzy s family writes @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 dimensionless coefficient , ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 [ l^1/2^/t ] ) we get the darcy - weisbach s ( resp .",
    "chzy s ) friction law .",
    "notice that the friction may depend on the space variable , especially on large parcels . in the sequel",
    "this will not be the case .",
    "* finally , @xmath32 is the viscous term with @xmath33 the viscosity of the fluid [ l^2^/t ] .      in this section ,",
    "we recall several properties of the shallow - water model that are useful in the flow description . for the sake of simplicity , we place ourselves in the one - dimensional case , extensions to the general setting being straightforward . the two - dimensional equations rewrite @xmath34    the left - hand side of this system is the transport operator , corresponding to the flow of an ideal fluid in a flat channel , without friction , rain or infiltration .",
    "this is actually the model introduced by saint - venant in @xcite , and it contains several important properties of the flow . in order to emphasize these properties , we first rewrite the one - dimensional equations using vectors form : @xmath35 with @xmath36 the flux of the equation .",
    "the transport is more clearly evidenced in the following nonconservative form , where @xmath37 is the matrix of transport coefficients : @xmath38 more precisely , when @xmath39 , the matrix @xmath40 turns out to be diagonalizable , with eigenvalues @xmath41 this important property is called strict hyperbolicity ( see for instance @xcite and references therein for more complete information ) .",
    "the eigenvalues are indeed velocities , namely the ones of surface waves on the fluid , which are basic characteristics of the flow .",
    "notice here that the eigenvalues coincide if @xmath42  m , that is for dry zones . in that case ,",
    "the system is no longer hyperbolic , and this induces difficulties at both theoretical and numerical levels . designing numerical schemes that preserve positivity for @xmath43 is very important in this context .    from these formul",
    "we recover a useful classification of flows , based on the relative values of the velocities of the fluid , @xmath44 , and of the waves , @xmath45 .",
    "indeed if @xmath46 the characteristic velocities have opposite signs , and information propagate upward as well as downward the flow , which is then said subcritical or fluvial . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath47 , the flow is supercritical , or torrential , all the information go downwards .",
    "a transcritical regime exists when some parts of a flow are subcritical , other supercritical .",
    "since we have two unknowns @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( or equivalently @xmath43 and @xmath48 ) , a subcritical flow is therefore determined by one upstream and one downstream value , whereas a supercritical flow is completely determined by the two upstream values .",
    "thus for numerical simulations , we have to impose one variable for subcritical inflow / outflow .",
    "we impose both variables for supercritical inflow and for supercritical outflow , free boundary conditions are considered ( see for example @xcite ) .    in this context ,",
    "two quantities are useful .",
    "the first one is a dimensionless parameter called the froude number @xmath49 it is the analogue of the mach number in gas dynamics , and the flow is subcritical ( resp .",
    "supercritical ) if @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 ) .",
    "the other important quantity is the so - called critical height @xmath52 which writes @xmath53 for a given discharge @xmath48 .",
    "it is a very readable criterion for criticality : the flow is subcritical ( resp .",
    "supercritical ) if @xmath54 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) .    when additional terms are present , other properties have to be considered , for instance the occurrence of steady states ( or equilibrium ) solutions .",
    "these specific flows are defined and discussed in section  [ sec : steady - state ] .",
    "[ morecells ]",
    "in this section , we focus on a family of steady state solutions , that is solutions that satisfy : @xmath56 replacing this relation in the one - dimensional shallow - water equations , the mass equation gives @xmath57 or @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "similarly the momentum equation writes @xmath60 thus for @xmath61 , we have the following system @xmath62 system is the key point of the following series of analytic solutions . for these solutions ,",
    "the strategy consists in choosing either a topography and getting the associated water height or a water height and deducing the associated topography . + since @xcite",
    ", it is well known that the source term treatment is a crucial point in preserving steady states . with the following steady states solutions",
    ", one can check if the steady state at rest and dynamic steady states are satisfied by the considered schemes using various flow conditions ( fluvial , torrential , transcritical , with shock , etc . ) .",
    "moreover , the variety of inflow and outflow configurations ( flat bottom / varying topography , with / without friction , etc . ) gives a validation of boundary conditions treatment .",
    "one must note that , as different source terms ( topography , friction , rain and diffusion ) are taken into account , these solutions can also validate the source terms treatment .",
    "+ the last remark deals with initial conditions : if initial conditions are taken equal to the solution at the steady state , one can only conclude on the ability of the numerical scheme to _ preserve _ steady states . in order to prove the capacity to _ catch _ these states , initial conditions should be different from the steady state .",
    "this is the reason why the initial conditions , as well as the boundary conditions , are described in each case .",
