    "master equation approach is a standard technique for open quantum systems  @xcite and a successful theory in descriptions of light - matter interactions , such as in condensed matter physics  @xcite , chemistry and biology  @xcite , quantum optics  @xcite , and ultracold gases  @xcite .",
    "the master equation is quite general and encompasses various physical phenomena , as long as these phenomena share common physical mechanisms , i.e. the interplay between coherence and dissipation .",
    "traditionally , these kinds of systems are treated within the framework of few - level models  @xcite . with the development of highly bright lasers  @xcite",
    ", however , the few - level models lose the possibility for describing complex open systems , since energy here is deposited in a broad range and relaxes in a vast number of decay channels . in this case ,",
    "new challenges appear for real dynamics of these complex systems , and a large - scale simulation is inevitable . here , one open issue , related to coherence effects in dynamical processes of complex systems , is still unknown .",
    "coherence plays an important role in describing correlation properties of quantum matters and understanding quantum phenomena including lasing  @xcite , fano shape  @xcite , superconductivity , superfluidity and bose - einstein condensate  @xcite , and novel phenomena arising from quantum optics  @xcite and attosecond physics  @xcite . to study these coherence - induced quantum features ,",
    "dramatic success has also been achieved in preparing and controlling the coherent dominant systems with suppressed dissipations , such as electromagnetically induced transparency in quantum optics  @xcite and superfluid - mott phase transition in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "recently , exploring coherence effects of complex systems has been arguably one of the most important topics in physics , inspired by generating x - ray laser with extremely high brightness and fully temporal coherence  @xcite , such as the linac coherent light source ( lcls )  @xcite , where one opened a new era of exploring the interaction of high - intensity x rays with complex systems on femtosecond ( fs ) timescales .",
    "unfortunately , a typical feature of x - ray - matter interactions is the rapid decay processes , due to the vast relax channels . as a result ,",
    "it is inevitable to investigate the interplay between coherence - induced effects and dissipations in x - ray - matter systems .    here",
    ", the x - ray free electron laser , with an ultrashort pulse duration and a high peak brilliance , provides the possibility for the study of physical , chemical and biological properties which are never accessed experimentally before  @xcite . for example , a series of pioneer experiments  @xcite focus on understanding of x - ray - matter interactions , including nonlinear photoionizations , hole relaxations , auger electron distributions , and x - ray emission spectrums in atoms , molecules and solid materials . to simulate these experiments , a semiclassical description of radiation - field coupled systems , einstein s rate equation approach  @xcite ,",
    "has recently been extended to the regime of x - ray - matter interactions for gaining fundamental insight into the fast decayed systems , by including photoexcitation and ionization , electron impact excitation and ionization , auger decay , and their reverse processes . in einstein s rate equation model ,",
    "all the absorption and emission processes are treated with transition probability and the coherence between different levels is neglected , which are good approximations for either incoherent light fields or dominant decay processes of the systemic coherence  @xcite .",
    "the agreement that one finds between theoretical predictions  @xcite and experiments  @xcite at relatively low atomic number densities , verifies the capability of the model to simulate x - ray - matter interactions .",
    "the physical reason is that the free - electron laser beam has limited temporal coherence with each pulse consisting of a random number of incoherent intensity spikes in a fs duration .",
    "one big challenge , however , which has not been overcome yet , is the temporal coherence of x - ray free - electron laser generated from self - amplified spontaneous emissions from electron beams  @xcite .",
    "one goal of the x - ray free - electron laser is to enhance temporal coherence of the field , and the quest for improved x - ray sources , based on the free electron laser , is being tackled with several techniques  @xcite . in fact , the new x - ray pulse with improved temporal coherence  @xcite is more suitable to locally deposit energy and prepare electronic states , study dynamical properties via photon correlation spectroscopy , and image biological specimens and long - rang orders in liquid and condensed matters  @xcite . recently , one generates the first successful coherent free - electron laser radiation pulses in the soft x - ray regime , based on the seeding experiment  @xcite , which experimentally provides the possibility for investigating the interplay between coherence and dissipation in x - ray - matter systems .",
    "then the crucial issue , related to an x - ray laser with an improved temporal coherence , is how to model the ultrafast dynamics of the x - ray - matter systems and understand the underlying physics . to obtain a more precise description of dynamical mechanics , in general , we need a quantum mechanical tool for simulations of its time evolution , such as time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "in contrast to the case of low - z species in dilute gases  @xcite , time - dependent schrdinger equation for complex systems is difficult to tackle directly , due to electron - electron correlations , collision processes , and spontaneous and auger decay processes .",
    "approximations for the x - ray - matter systems are inevitable , such as master equation approach . in the master equation approach , one can include the important microscopic processes as much as possible and investigate the interplay between coherence and dissipations in the x - ray - matter systems . instead of a few - level simulations  @xcite , one need to simulate _",
    "real _ dynamics of the complex x - ray - matter systems based on large scale simulations , due to the vast decay channels induced by the intense x - ray laser .",
    "as far as we know , this problem is never explored in the framework of quantum master equation approach before , coherent dynamics of the complex systems is still unclear , and it is still an open issue whether new phenomena arise from coherence effects in the ultrafast decayed systems .",
    "these questions motivate our study in this paper to establish a general method for describing coherent dynamics of the x - ray - matter systems in the framework of master equation approach . in principle",
    ", master equation approach can deal with different kinds of dynamics of the intense x - ray - matter systems by including the microscopic processes due to photons , electrons and environments . in dilute atomic gases",
    "@xcite , for example , one should include photoexcitations and ionizations , auger and spontaneous decay processes , and their reverse processes . for dilute molecules  @xcite , additional processes , such as photon dissociations",
    ", should be taken into account . for solid - dense warm and hot matters",
    "@xcite , electron impact excitations and ionizations play an important role , in addition to environmental screening effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we develop a thousand state master equation for describing _ real _ dynamics of these complex systems induced by an x - ray laser , and discuss possible experimental implementations such as signatures for coherent evolution of inner - shell electrons .",
    "our studies will provide the basis for understanding the coherence effects in x - ray absorption mechanisms at a fundamental level .",
    "actually , if all the off diagonal elements of the density matrix are ignored , our method reduces to einstein s rate equation approach , which is a semiclassical description for x - ray - matter interactions  @xcite .",
    "the present approach can be applied to many different practical open quantum systems , which are widely treated qualitatively before by a few - level master equation approach  @xcite , such as those in atomic physics  @xcite , quantum optics  @xcite and cold matter physics  @xcite .",
    "shell dominate the photoabsorptions , followed by the consequent further outer - shell ionizations ( a ) and auger decay processes ( b ) , ending up with a highly ionized stage .",

    ", comparisons between master equation and rate equation approach will be made to investigate the influence of coherence on the dynamical mechanics , as related to the ongoing experiments with different temporal coherence . in parallel",
    ", we also perform an approximate calculation based on a degenerate atomic master equation approach which is computationally more affordable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a detailed description of the approach .",
    "section iii covers our results for coherent dynamics of neon induced by an x - ray laser , and discusses auger processes of neon based on thousand state master equation approach .",
    "we summarize with a discussion in section iv .",
    "we consider a many - body system , such as dilute atomic and molecular gases  @xcite , and solid - state materials  @xcite , coupled with incoherent sources such as vacuum , irradiated by a high intensity x - ray laser .",
    "inner - shell electrons of these atoms and molecules will be excited , forming a far - off - equilibrium system and typically relaxing in a fs timescale via spontaneous , coulombic and auger decay processes .",
    "these processes compete with other mechanics , such as processes including coherent photoexcitations and ionizations .",
    "correspondingly , the total hamiltonian of the x - ray - matter systems can be written as @xmath2 where the total hamiltonian is the sum of the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the many - body system in vacuum , the external field hamiltonian @xmath4 including the coherent and incoherent external field , the laser - matter interaction @xmath5 , and the incoherent - field - matter interaction @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 governs the time evolution of the system in vacuum , such as dilute atomic and molecular gases , and condensed materials , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the total energy levels included .",

    "with the semi - classical treatment for the laser field , the quantization of the light is ignored .",
    "instead the light is considered as a electric field , @xmath20 , which interacts with the @xmath16-th dipole @xmath21 for the transition between states @xmath10 and @xmath22 to give @xmath23 where the transition operator @xmath24 , and rabi frequency @xmath25 at time @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",

    "( [ field ] ) can be ignored in the simulations .",
    "this semiclassical approximation forms the basis of most investigations on the many - body systems both coherently and incoherently coupled by a strong external field .    for magnetic sublevels ,",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian of the matter - field interaction in a more explicit form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the polarization of the external laser , and the dipole operator @xmath32 describes a @xmath33 transition between states @xmath34 and @xmath35 with zeeman substructures .    actually",
    ", we can remove the explicit time dependence from the hamiltonian , if rabi frequency @xmath36 is time independent and @xmath37 , transforming the hamiltonian of the system to an arbitrarily specified rotating frame .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath38 reads @xmath39    the system can also be pumped by an incoherent field , such as the black - body radiation field in a hot plasma environment , and it reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the directions of the dipole moment @xmath21 , the polarization of the incoherent field , respectively .",
    "actually , the contributions of the incoherent field can directly be included in the master equation approach  @xcite , as discussed in sec .",

    "now , the next question is how to theoretically simulate the time evolution of complex systems in the presence of the x - ray laser , described by eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "in contrast to low - z atomic and molecular gases  @xcite , the x - ray - matter system is dominated by ultrafast decayed mechanics in the experimental timescales , such as spontaneous decay processes , where one loses the possibility to keep track of the couplings between the system and the environment with infinite degrees of freedom . in solid - state materials , electron - ion ,",
    "electron - electron and ion - ion collisions occur rapidly and randomly , where screening and broadening effects due to the solid - density environment should be taken into account in dynamical simulations .",
    "hence , a statistical description for the x - ray - matter system is needed , and here we study the time evolution based on a generalized thousand state master equation approach for the reduced density matrix of the system , where the degrees of freedom of both the environment and x - ray laser have been traced out in a perturbative treatment .",

    "here , the first term in the right side describes the coherent dynamics of the multilevel system coupled with the laser field , and the second term denotes the incoherent processes , such as spontaneous and auger decays , transitions due to the black - body radiation field and collision processes .",
    "the contributions of the black - body radiation pump are only nontrivial in warm and hot matters , and collision processes can be neglected for the dilute atomic and molecular gases since it occurs in a fs timescale being much shorter than the average particle - collision time .",

    "( [ hamil ] ) and plasma environments are included to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ master - eq ] ) , while the corresponding energy shifts are incorporated in the energy levels of the system in vacuum .",
    "we remark here that the thousand state master equation has unique features , which needs large - scale simulations for propagating in time a matrix of @xmath47 and is not trivial to solve directly , such as stability of numerical linear algebra and parallel procedure demanding .",
    "there are two possible ways to take photoionization processes into account in our simulations . while we treat the ionization as incoherent processes by adding photoionization cross section in the incoherent terms for the low intensity x - ray laser , we consider ionization as coherent processes for multiphoton dominant processes , which features analogies to bound - state transitions of the system .",
    "for multiphoton dominant processes , the ionized state composing of the residual system and ionized electrons reads @xmath48 , @xmath49 , j , @xmath11 , p denote the angular momentum of the residual system , relativistic angular momentum of free electrons , total angular momentum , total energy and parity of the system , respectively . in the physical systems",
    ", these states can be populated by multiphoton excitations .",
    "considering the large amount of continuous states , selection rules should be used to solely include dominant states , such as degenerate initial , intermediate and finial continuous states connected by multiphoton energies , and at the same time neglect states detuned from resonance excitations since the finite time duration of the x - ray laser implies a finite fourier width for the bound - free or free - free transitions .",
    "these selections are a good approximation for hydrogen in the presence of strong laser beams , and therefore we anticipate that the dominant states for ionizations of a complex system should be similar .",

    "<S> we develop a large scale quantum master equation approach to describe dynamical processes of practical open quantum systems driven by both coherent and stochastic interactions by including more than one thousand true states of the systems , motivated by the development of highly bright and fully coherent lasers in the x - ray wavelength regime . </S>",
    "<S> the method combines the processes of coherent dynamics induced by the x - ray laser and incoherent relaxations due to spontaneous emissions , auger decays , and electronic collisions . as examples , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical investigation of _ real _ coherent dynamics of inner - shell electrons of a neon gas , irradiated by a high - intensity x - ray laser with a full temporal coherence , is carried out with the approach . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the rate equation treatment , we find that coherence can suppress the multiphoton absorptions of a neon gas in the ultra - intense x - ray pulse , due to coherence - induced rabi oscillations and power broadening effects . </S>",
    "<S> we study the influence of coherence on ionization processes of neon , and directly prove that sequential single - photon processes for both outer- and inner - shell electrons dominate the ionizations for the recently typical experiments with a laser intensity of @xmath0 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible experimental implementations such as signatures for coherent evolution of inner - shell electrons via resonance fluorescence processes . </S>",
    "<S> the approach can also be applied to many different practical open quantum systems in atomic , quantum optical , and cold matter systems , which are treated qualitatively by a few - level master equation model before . </S>"
