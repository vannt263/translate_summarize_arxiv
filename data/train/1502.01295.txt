    "our goal is to estimate the probability @xmath165 that important colours distinguish endpoints of edges in @xmath166 $ ] , which is the graph induced by those vertices that are coloured with unimportant colours and that are adjacent to at least one vertex from each unimportant colour class .",
    "since the number of configurations to investigate is at most @xmath167 it is enough to estimate @xmath165 from above by , say , @xmath168 the result will then follow immediately by the union bound .",
    "the expected number of edges in @xmath166 $ ] is @xmath169 , and so it follows from chernoff s bound that with probability at most @xmath170 the number of edges is smaller than , say , @xmath171 . on the other hand , if the maximum degree in @xmath166 $ ] is larger than @xmath152 ( for some configuration @xmath172 ) , then we stop the whole argument and claim no lower bound for @xmath13 . recall that at the beginning of the proof , we showed that a.a.s",

    "let us note that if @xmath215 , where @xmath17 is defined so that @xmath216 , then suen s inequality can be avoided and we can simply use chernoff s bound to obtain the desired upper bound for @xmath217 : indeed , it follows from the claim proved above that there exists a matching in @xmath166 $ ] consisting of at least @xmath218 edges ; otherwise , the remaining @xmath219 vertices in @xmath175 would form an independent set that could be split into two sets of equal size and , clearly , no edge will be present between them , contradicting the claim .",
    "since the events are now independent , and the expected number of edge endpoints not distinguished is @xmath220 the desired bound holds , since @xmath221 by chernoff s bound .",
    "it remains to consider the case @xmath222 .",
