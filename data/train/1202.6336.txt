    "one further source of arbitrariness is the choice of the logarithms to be resummed .",
    "in fact , it is not clear whether powers of @xmath85 or powers of _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath86 have to be resummed .",
    "the origin of this arbitrariness has to do with how much of the non - logarithmic part of the fixed - order prediction is exponentiated together with the logarithms .",

    "@xcite several prescriptions are given on how to set the correct variation range for @xmath83 for different observables .",

    "this choice is also close to the nominal range of variation proposed in  @xcite .",

    "apart from the far infrared region , it is observed to decrease by @xmath89 in the peak region . the scale - dependence reduction is smaller towards the multijet region , where the contribution of the logarithmic part becomes less important .",
    "the resummation uncertainty at nnll+nnlo varies between @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the right plot",
    "the same comparison is made at nnll+nnlo using the @xmath2-matching and @xmath1-matching schemes .",
    "we observe a similar @xmath83-dependence in both schemes .",
    "the recent results on event shape resummation improve the description of existing experimental data . in view of future work at high energy linear colliders and precise determinations of the strong coupling constant , n@xmath92ll predictions for the remaining event - shape observables are necessary .",
    "moreover , an additional source of uncertainty is due to power - behaved hadronisation corrections which get large in the dijet region .",
    "currently there is no deep theoretical understanding of such corrections which constitute an important source of theoretical error . in the past ,",
    "these were often computed using leading - logarithmic parton shower monte carlo programs , which turned out to be clearly insufficient  @xcite in view of the precision now attained by the perturbative description .",
    "systematic approaches to hadronization within the dispersive model  @xcite or by using the shape function formalism  @xcite are offering a more reliable description .",
    "such corrections are quite sizeable at lep energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nonpt1 ] ) while they are highly suppressed at future linear colliders energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nonpt2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonpt1 ] we show what the power - corrected distribution looks like when compared to the pure perturbative answer .",
    "non - perturbative corrections are computed with a dispersive model @xcite and both the mean effective coupling @xmath93 and the strong coupling @xmath94 are obtained by performing a simultaneous fit using aleph data at @xmath95  gev .",
    "such a fit is purely qualitative since the correlation matrix is degenerate when only one data set is used . to perform a meaningful fit , experimental data over a broader range of energies have to be included .",
