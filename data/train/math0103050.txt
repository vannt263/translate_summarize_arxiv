    "we say that @xmath14 is _ recurrent _",
    "( for a given @xmath16 in the underlying probability space ) if @xmath17 along some subsequence @xmath18 .",

    "i.e. , with every finite segment either flat or else having a southwest  northeast ( resp . , northwest  southeast ) orientation [ lemma  [ l2 ] ] .",
    "if there were more than a single such `` domain wall '' in a recurrent state , there would be further restrictions concerning their relative locations ( see , e.g. , the proof of lemma [ l5 ] ) .",
    "but we conjecture that this does not occur ; indeed , we expect that one of the following two possibilities occurs .    * scenario 1 : almost surely , the null recurrent states are exactly all states with single infinite monotonic domain walls while the set of all other nonconstant states is transient .",

    "rigorous and nonrigorous results have been obtained on different questions that arise naturally in this context , such as the formation of domains , their subsequent evolution , spatial and temporal scaling properties and related problems ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in particular , in the context of zero - temperature , stochastic ising models with nearest - neighbor interactions , the question of whether the spin configuration eventually settles down to a final state has been addressed rigorously and answered for a number of different models @xcite .",
    "a closely related issue is that of persistence , concerning the fraction of sites that have not flipped at all by time @xmath7 , and its asymptotic behavior as @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the zero - temperature , stochastic ( homogeneous ) ising model @xmath6 on @xmath31 with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interactions . in dimension one , the model is the same as the @xmath32 voter model , which is well understood ( see , e.g. , chapter 2 of @xcite or chapter v of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we study in detail the case @xmath33 , for which it is known that there is not a unique limiting state @xcite , and consider questions about the limits along subsequences of time and the nature of clusters of sites of the same sign .",
    "the aim of the paper is to give a picture of the system for very long times , showing what kinds of events and states are seen as @xmath5 and what are instead `` forbidden '' .",
    "these are basically questions of recurrence and transience .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we define the model precisely and discuss some results and open problems about this and related models .",
    "the stochastic process @xmath34 corresponds to the zero - temperature limit of glauber dynamics for an ising model with ( formal ) hamiltonian @xmath35 here the state space is @xmath36 , the space of ( infinite - volume ) spin configurations @xmath14 , and @xmath37 denotes euclidean length .",

    "+ the next theorem , combined with the first part of theorem [ t4 ] , shows that each of the two constant states is positive recurrent in the sense of section 1 .",
    "* we introduce the following events that , like @xmath193 , are increasing in the fkg sense : @xmath197 note that @xmath198 .",
    "we also define the corresponding events with @xmath199 replaced by @xmath200 . with these definitions , we have @xmath201 and therefore @xmath202 using the fact that @xmath203 and @xmath204 are increasing events and the fkg property of the distribution of @xmath6 ( see the proof of proposition [ p2 ] ) , we get @xmath205    because of the `` striped '' nature of the absorbing states , @xmath206 by the symmetries of the model , the two terms in the right hand side of ( [ absstates ] ) are equal and therefore @xmath207 thus @xmath208 applying theorem [ t2 ] and symmetry , we obtain @xmath209 taking the @xmath210 of both sides of ( [ fkg ] ) and using theorem [ t2 ] once more , we have @xmath211    [ r1 ] a natural conjecture is that the system is in a constant ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) state with probability approaching @xmath40 as @xmath5 , i.e. , for all @xmath178 , @xmath212 this is equivalent to the conjecture for our @xmath33 process that _ clustering _ occurs : @xmath213 in @xmath32 , our process is the same as the one - dimensional voter model , for which clustering is known to occur @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the next result is a corollary of theorem [ t3 ] .",
    "recall that @xmath214 denotes the euclidean distance from the origin to the closest site in its cluster that is next to the cluster boundary .",
    "more precisely , given a subset @xmath110 of @xmath2 and @xmath117 , define the distance @xmath215 .",
    "the inner boundary of @xmath110 is @xmath216",
    ". then @xmath217 .      *",
    "* define the event @xmath219 by theorem [ t3 ] and ( [ lemma ] ) ( applied for fixed @xmath178 to the events @xmath220 for a sequence of times ) , we have @xmath221 for every @xmath178 .",
    "then , letting @xmath222 , we have @xmath223 it is easy to see that the event @xmath224 in ( [ limsup ] ) occurs if and only if its translation , i.e. , the event that @xmath225 , occurs .",
    "thus @xmath226 is translation - invariant and by the translation - ergodicity of @xmath64 , ( [ limsup ] ) implies that @xmath227 , as desired . + as mentioned before , in dimension two , the state @xmath6 does not have a unique limit as @xmath5 @xcite ; thus we are interested in the limits along subsequences of @xmath7 .",
    "let us introduce the ( @xmath16-dependent ) set of all limiting states , @xmath228 the following theorem concerns such subsequence limits .",
    "the first statement of the theorem means that there exists an @xmath16-dependent sequence @xmath229 so that @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "the proof that the constant @xmath0 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath1 ) state is in @xmath233 is essentially the same as the proof of corollary [ c1 ] , but with the event @xmath234 replaced by the event that @xmath235 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath236 ) occurs for an unbounded set of @xmath7 s .    to prove the second part of the theorem",
    ", we consider the square @xmath129 ( with l even , for a reason to be seen later ) and use the fact @xcite that @xmath237 flips infinitely many times almost surely .",
    "we restrict attention to times @xmath7 greater than @xmath238 , the almost surely finite time after which @xmath239 is not e - absent and hence satisfies various geometric constraints , including those discussed in the proof of lemma [ l5 ] .    there will almost surely be a sequence @xmath18 , of times ( either just before or just after the flips of the origin ) when there is a ( monotonic ) domain wall @xmath240 , whose endpoints are just outside @xmath148 , passing next to the origin and containing the origin in its spanning rectangle @xmath241 .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( 1 ) @xmath240 connects two opposite sides of the boundary of @xmath148 , or ( 2 ) two adjacent sides .",
    "let @xmath242 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath243 ) denote the event that ( 1 ) ( resp .",
    ", ( 2 ) ) occurs for an unbounded set of @xmath7 s .",
    "then @xmath244 and so @xmath245 either for @xmath246 ( we call this case 1 ) or @xmath247 ( case 2 ) or both . the @xmath240 of ( 1 ) may be either horizontal or vertical , so we express @xmath242 as the ( not necessarily disjoint ) union of events @xmath248 and @xmath249 according to whether a horizontal or a vertical @xmath240 recurs . by symmetry , these two events have equal probability , so that in case 1 , there is a subsequence @xmath250 such that @xmath251 for all @xmath252 .    consider a time @xmath253 when such a horizontal @xmath240 is present . by the monotonicity and other geometric restrictions on the domain walls that follow because @xmath254 is not e - absent , it follows that there is a sequence of spin flips ( with a bounded away from zero probability of occurring in the next unit time interval ) that will deform such a @xmath254 into one where there is a horizontal flat domain wall @xmath255 just under the origin and further such that @xmath256 ( i.e. , inside @xmath129 , @xmath6 agrees with an absorbing state ) .",
    "thus the event @xmath257 , that @xmath256 with a horizontal flat domain wall just under the origin for an unbounded set of @xmath7 s , has @xmath258 for all @xmath252 .",
    "proceeding as in the proof of corollary [ c1 ] ( but using ergodicity only with respect to translations in the first coordinate ) , we conclude that @xmath259 , which , together with standard compactness arguments , completes the proof for case 1 .",
    "case 2 is similar , but with an extra ingredient .",
    "here we express @xmath243 as the union of @xmath260 , where @xmath240 connects the north and east sides of the boundary of @xmath148 , and the three other directional possibilities . for a northeast @xmath240",
    ", we use spin flips to deform @xmath254 to a @xmath261 containing a contour that is horizontal and flat from the origin to the eastern side of @xmath148 , and such that inside the smaller square @xmath262 , centered at @xmath263 , @xmath261 agrees with an absorbing state . by translating @xmath263 to the origin and using translation invariance",
    ", we have in case 2 for some subsequence @xmath264 that @xmath265 for all @xmath252 . the remainder of the proof is as in case 1 .",
    "+    [ r2 ] we note that @xmath266 is almost surely strictly larger than @xmath267 .",
    "otherwise , it could not be the case that almost surely every site flips infinitely many times .",
    "indeed , by arguments similar to those used for theorem [ t4 ] , there almost surely must be recurrent states that have a domain wall passing by the origin that is flat except for a single step right by ( or any fixed distance away from ) the origin .",
    "there are of course also many states that are almost surely transient , such as ones with non - monotonic domain walls or more generally ones that , restricted to some @xmath129 , do not satisfy the geometric conditions , such as those in the proof of lemma [ l5 ] , that prevent non - monotonic domain walls from forming .",
    "[ r3 ] the proof of theorem [ t4 ] makes it clear that @xmath266 must almost surely contain non - constant absorbing states both with horizontal and with vertical flat domain walls .",
    "similarly , the single step domain walls mentioned in the previous remark will be both horizontal and vertical ( and with the steps at all possible distances from the origin ) .",
    "it is a natural conjecture , discussed in section 1 , that almost surely all recurrent states , besides the two constant states , have only a single ( monotonic ) doubly - infinite domain wall .",
    "two possibilities as to the exact class of recurrent states are discussed at the end of section  [ synopsis ] .",
    "we have not been able to show that almost surely some state with a single doubly - infinite domain wall is in fact recurrent . however ,",
    "by using arguments like those in the proof of theorem [ t4 ] , one can show that there are almost surely recurrent ( absorbing ) states with a flat domain wall next to the origin and no other domain walls in a half - space .",
