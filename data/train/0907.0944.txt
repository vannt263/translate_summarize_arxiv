    "aperture synthesis in radio interferometry is a powerful technique in radio astronomy , allowing observations of the sky with otherwise inaccessible angular resolutions and sensitivities .",
    "this technique dates back to more than sixty years ago @xcite . in this context",
    ", the portion of the celestial sphere around the pointing direction tracked by a radio telescope array during observation defines the original real signal or image probed @xmath0 .",
    "the field of view observed is limited by a primary beam @xmath1 .",
    "standard interferometers are characterized by a small field of view , so that the signal and the primary beam are assumed to be planar . considering non - polarized radiation",
    ", they respectively read as scalar functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the position @xmath4 , with components @xmath5 .",
    "each telescope pair at one instant of observation identifies a baseline defined as the relative position between the two telescopes . to each baseline @xmath6 , with components @xmath7 in units of the signal emission wavelength @xmath8 , is associated one measurement called visibility . in the simplest",
    "setting one also considers baselines with negligible component @xmath9 in the pointing direction of the instrument . under this additional assumption ,",
    "if the signal is made up of incoherent sources , each visibility corresponds to the value of the fourier transform of the signal multiplied by the primary beam at a spatial frequency @xmath10 , identified by the components @xmath11 of the baseline projection on the plane of the signal .",
    "radio - interferometric data are thus identified by incomplete and noisy measurements in the fourier plane . in the perspective of the reconstruction of the original image",
    ", these data define an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "it is well - known that a large variety of natural signals are sparse or compressible in multi - scale dictionaries , such as wavelet frames .",
    "a band - limited signal may be expressed as the @xmath12-dimensional vector of its values sampled at the nyquist - shannon rate . by definition ,",
    "a signal is sparse in some basis if its expansion contains only a small number @xmath13 of non - zero coefficients .",
    "more generally it is compressible if its expansion only contains a small number of significant coefficients , i.e. if a large number of its coefficients bear a negligible value .",
    "the theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that , for sparse or compressible signals , a small number @xmath14 of random measurements , in a sensing basis incoherent with the sparsity basis , will suffice for an accurate and stable reconstruction of the signals @xcite .",
    "the mutual coherence between two bases may be defined as the maximum complex modulus of the scalar product between unit - norm vectors of the two bases .",
    "random fourier measurements of a signal sparse in real space are a particular example of a good sensing procedure in this context .    in a very recent work @xcite , we presented results showing that compressed sensing offers powerful image reconstruction techniques for radio - interferometric data , in the case of baselines with negligible component @xmath9 .",
    "these techniques are based on global basis pursuit ( @xmath15 ) minimization problems , which are solved by convex optimization algorithms .",
    "we particularly illustrated the versatility of the scheme relative to the inclusion of specific prior information on the signal in the minimization problems .",
    "in the present work , we raise the important problem of the dependence of the image reconstruction quality as a function of the sparsity basis , or more generally the sparsity dictionary . the larger the typical size of the waveforms constituting the dictionary in which the signal is sparse or compressible in real space , the smaller their extension in the fourier plane , and the smaller the incoherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries . in the context of compressed sensing ,",
    "a loss of incoherence leads to a degradation of the reconstruction quality for a given sparsity @xmath16 and a given number @xmath17 of random measurements .",
    "the detailed structure of radio - interferometric measurements might actually provide a natural response to this issue .",
    "the approximation of baselines with negligible component @xmath9 is a key assumption in order to identify visibilities with fourier measurements of the original signal .",
    "this approximation actually sets a strong constraint on the field of view probed by the interferometer , requiring that it is small enough , not only for the planar approximation of the signal but also to neglect the complete effect of the component @xmath9 in the visibilities .",
    "we relax this approximation and consider radio interferometers with small field of view and baselines with non - negligible component @xmath9 . in this context",
    ", each visibility at spatial frequency @xmath18 identifies with the fourier transform of a complex signal obtained as the product of the original planar signal multiplied by the primary beam with a linear chirp @xmath19 where the norm @xmath20 identifies the distance to the center of the image .",
    "note that this chirp is a priori characterized by a different chirp rate for each baseline : @xmath21 . in the fourier plane",
    ", the modulation amounts to the convolution of the fourier transform of the chirp with that of the signal multiplied by the primary beam , which inevitably spreads the two - dimensional sample power spectrum of the constitutive waveforms .",
    "this spread spectrum phenomenon increases the incoherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries .    in this context , we define signals made up of gaussian waveforms with equal size , identified by a standard deviation @xmath22 , considered as a rough representation of any kind of astrophysical structure .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that all baselines , identified by the spatial frequencies @xmath18 , have the same component @xmath9 , so that all visibilities are affected by the same chirp . a theoretical computation of the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath9 naturally proves that the coherence decreases when @xmath9 increases , through the spread spectrum phenomenon .",
    "our theoretical relation also shows that the coherence may be decreased as close as required to the minimum coherence between the real and fourier spaces through the use of a large enough chirp rate @xmath9 . in light of the theory of compressed",
    "sensing , this suggests some universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon according to which , for a given sparsity @xmath16 and a given number @xmath17 of random measurements , the quality of the @xmath15 reconstruction would not only increase when @xmath9 increases , but could also be rendered independent of the sparsity dictionary for large enough chirp rate @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath15 reconstruction could be made as good for signals sparse in a dictionary of gaussian waveforms of any size , as for signals sparse in real space .",
    "we produce simulations of the signals considered , and perform @xmath15 reconstructions from noisy visibility measurements .",
    "our results confirm the universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity dictionary .",
    "let us acknowledge the fact that spread spectrum techniques are widely used in telecommunications . in this context , chirp modulations are used in particular to render transmitted signals more robust to noise . in the context of compressed sensing ,",
    "spread spectrum techniques using pseudo - random modulations have very recently been highlighted as a means to enhance the signal reconstruction and render it stable relative to noise @xcite .",
    "the use of chirp modulations has also been proposed in compressed sensing radar to produce a convolution of a sparse signal in the sparsity basis itself before performing measurements in that same basis @xcite . in this respect , these techniques are much more related to coded aperture techniques @xcite as well as to compressed sensing by random convolution @xcite than to spread spectrum techniques .    in section [ sec : radio interferometry ] , we formulate the interferometric inverse problem for image reconstruction on small field of view in the presence of a non - negligible and constant component @xmath9 of the baselines . in section [ sec : compressed sensing ] , we concisely recall results of the theory of compressed sensing regarding the definition of a sensing basis and the accurate reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals from @xmath15 . in section [ sec : spread spectrum universality ] , we establish the universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon for a sparsity dictionary made up of gaussian waveforms , both from theoretical considerations and on the basis of simulations .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we recall the general form of the visibility measurements and study the approximation of a small field of view and baselines with non - negligible component @xmath9 . we identify in particular the corresponding spread spectrum phenomenon in the presence of a constant component @xmath9 .",
    "we also pose the corresponding interferometric inverse problem for image reconstruction .      in a tracking configuration , all radio telescopes of an interferometric array point in the same direction on the unit celestial sphere",

    ", we make the two assumptions of small field of view and baselines with non - negligible component @xmath9 .",
    "firstly , we consider a standard interferometer with a primary beam of small enough angular support , so that the field of view may be identified with a patch of the tangent plane at @xmath35 . technically this amounts to assume that @xmath58 on the field of view so that the zero order expansion @xmath59 is valid in the invariant measure on the sphere , which therefore identifies with that on the plane : @xmath60 .",
    "the signal and the primary beam hence become scalar square - integrable functions in the plane @xmath61 . secondly",
    ", we consider interferometers with large enough values of the @xmath62 , so that the same approximation on @xmath63 does not hold for the phase of the imaginary exponential @xcite . in this case",
    "any term discarded in @xmath63 should be small relative to @xmath64 .",
    "we assume however that the further constraint on the field of view @xmath65 holds for all @xmath18 , so that the second order approximation @xmath66 is valid in the imaginary exponential .",
    "under these conditions , each visibility takes the form : @xmath67 in other words the visibility in @xmath18 identifies with the value in @xmath18 of the two - dimensional fourier transform of a complex signal obtained as the product of the original planar signal @xmath68 with a linear chirp modulation @xmath69 .",
    "this chirp is characterized by a chirp rate @xmath62 depending on @xmath18 , and @xmath70 now identifies the distance to the origin in the plane of the signal , i.e. to the point identified by @xmath35 .",
    "note that in the further approximation that @xmath71 for all @xmath18 , the chirp indeed disappears and relation ( [ ri3 ] ) reduces to the standard van cittert - zernike theorem .",
    "this theorem states that the visibilities measured identify with the two - dimensional fourier transform of the signal multiplied by the primary beam : @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the fact that baselines may have non - negligible component @xmath9 is at the origin of important challenges from the computational point of view .",
    "this issue is related to the fact that the explicit computation of simulated visibilities in ( [ ri2 ] ) from a signal and the corresponding inverse problem have a large complexity . in the case of baselines with negligible component @xmath62 at each @xmath18 , the simple two - dimensional fourier",
    "transform relation between signal and visibilities allows the use of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , which substantially lightens the computation .",
    "this is not possible anymore in the case of baselines with non - negligible component @xmath62 as the chirp modulation is characterized by a chirp rate explicitly dependent on @xmath18 , and therefore needs to be imposed separately for each visibility .",
    "a number of algorithms have been studied in this case , among which faceting algorithms as well as the very recent @xmath9-projection algorithm @xcite . in one word",
    "this @xmath9-projection algorithm simply computes a unique fft , after which the visibility at each @xmath18 is obtained by the evaluation , at this @xmath18 , of the convolution of the fourier transform of the signal with that of the chirp with chirp rate @xmath62 .",
    "considerations on the extension of the corresponding convolution kernel in the fourier plane allows to drastically reduce the computational load in practice .",
    "these algorithmic issues are however not our concern here .",
    "we only aim at discussing how this natural and compulsory chirp modulation may drastically enhance the quality of signal reconstruction .",
    "we already acknowledged that , in the course of an observation , the two - dimensional vector @xmath18 associated with each telescope pair runs over an arc of ellipse , and the corresponding component @xmath9 follows a sinusoidal evolution .",
    "however , the whole baseline distribution in @xmath33 is extremely dependent on the specific configuration of the radio telescope array under consideration .",
    "visibilities from various interferometers may also be combined , as well as visibilities from the same interferometer with different pointing directions through the mosaicking technique @xcite . from this point of view",
    "the baseline distributions are rather flexible .    relying on this flexibility",
    "we assume that all baselines have the same component in the pointing direction : @xmath73 . during observation .",
    "for particular configurations of telescopes in two east - west linear arrays , all telescope pairs with each telescope belonging to a different array would produce baselines with identical value of @xmath9 .",
    "] this assumption of constant component @xmath9 allows us to discard considerations related to specific interferometers .",
    "moreover , it also allows us to study the impact of a chirp modulation on the basis of a large range of simulations at light computational load . under this assumption",
    "all visibilities indeed identify with the values of the two - dimensional fourier transform of a complex signal obtained as the product of the original planar signal @xmath68 with the same linear chirp @xmath74 characterized by the chirp rate @xmath9 independent of @xmath18 : @xmath75    note that the multiplication by the chirp modulation amounts to the convolution of the fourier transform of the chirp with that of the original signal multiplied by the primary beam : @xmath76 .",
    "this convolution inevitably spreads the two - dimensional sample power spectrum of the signal multiplied by the primary beam , i.e. the square modulus of its fourier transform , while preserving its norm .",

    "this simple consideration already quantifies the spread spectrum phenomenon associated with the chirp modulation .",

    "the fourier transform of the product @xmath92 does not bear any specific symmetry property in the fourier plane .    as in @xcite , we assume that the spatial frequencies @xmath18 probed by all telescope pairs during the observation belong to the discrete grid of points @xmath91 . the fourier coverage provided by the @xmath93 spatial frequencies probed @xmath94 , with @xmath95 ,",

    "this noise level estimator follows a chi - square distribution with @xmath17 degrees of freedom .",

    "on the one hand , the standard clean algorithm is essentially a matching pursuit ( @xmath233 ) algorithm @xcite which works by iterative removal of the so - called dirty beam , i.e. the inverse fourier transform of the mask , in real space @xcite .",
    "it is also known that clean provides reconstruction qualities very similar to what we just called the @xmath229 approach @xcite . on the other hand , multi - scale versions of clean can in principle account for the fact that the signal may be sparser in some multi - scale dictionary @xcite .",
    "assuming that the signals considered have a very sparse expansion in such dictionaries , the corresponding performances would probably be very close to that of our @xmath224 approach , provided that the equivalence between @xmath233 and @xmath15 still holds in a multi - scale setting .",

    "this suggests that for the signals considered it is better to optimize the sparsity by accounting for the proper dictionary , than to optimize the mutual coherence by formally postulating that the signal lives in real space .",
    "it also appears that , for each number of visibilities measured @xmath93 , the @xmath234 of both kinds of reconstructions significantly degrades when the size @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms increases .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that either the mutual coherence , in the case of @xmath227 , or the sparsity , in the case of @xmath231 , get farther from their optimal values .",

    "this illustrates the fact that the mutual coherence is already optimal in the absence of chirp modulation , so that any chirp modulation will fail to enhance the reconstruction quality .",
    "let us also emphasize that we have implemented the standard clean algorithm for comparison with this @xmath235 setting .",
    "for each value of @xmath204 and @xmath17 and both for @xmath187 and @xmath184 , the corresponding @xmath234 of reconstruction ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) remains , as expected , undistinguishable from both the @xmath231 and @xmath232 reconstructions at @xmath96 standard deviation .",
    "fourthly , for any number of visibilities measured @xmath93 and for large enough size @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms , the @xmath234 of the @xmath228 is significantly larger than that of the @xmath227 reconstruction .",
    "this is the spread spectrum phenomenon related to the reduction of the mutual coherence in the presence of the chirp modulation .",
    "moreover , the @xmath234 of the @xmath228 reconstruction is essentially independent of the sparsity dictionary identified by @xmath204 .",
    "this supports very strongly the principle of universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity dictionary , in perfect agreement with our theoretical considerations .",
    "the reconstruction quality also appears to be more stable around the mean @xmath234 values in the presence of the chirp modulation .    finally , let us note that our pure considerations on sparsity and mutual coherence led to relation ( [ ssu3 ] ) , which suggests the spread spectrum universality and associated optimal reconstructions in the @xmath224 setting in the limit of an infinite chirp rate . in practice",
    "though , the @xmath234 of a @xmath224 reconstruction should saturate at some finite value , and progressively degrade above this value , due to a leakage phenomenon .",
    "the larger @xmath211 , the larger the spreading of the spectrum of the signal .",
    "but the extent of the fourier coverages considered is limited by the band limit @xmath208 . consequently , when the band limit of the signal after chirp modulation significantly exceeds the band limit where the visibility distributions are defined , a significant part of the energy of the signal remains unprobed .",
    "simulations and reconstructions have actually been performed for a range of chirp modulations with chirp rates between @xmath187 and @xmath184 , as well as for a higher chirp rate @xmath236 , in both the @xmath224 setting and the @xmath235 setting . in the @xmath224 setting , the @xmath234 of reconstruction ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) undergoes a natural continuous increase for values @xmath237 from the @xmath227 curve to the @xmath228 curve , confirming the spread spectrum phenomenon for all values of @xmath204 and @xmath17 considered .",
    "the saturation of the @xmath234 occurs around @xmath184 , and its degradation is for example already significant for a chirp rate @xmath236 , for @xmath206 and all values of @xmath17 considered . in the @xmath235 setting , the @xmath234 of reconstruction ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) exhibits no evolution for values @xmath237 , independently of the values of @xmath204 and @xmath17 considered , confirming the fact that the chirp modulation has no impact on the mutual coherence .",
    "however , the leakage phenomenon obviously also affects the reconstructions .",
    "the corresponding degradation is observed in the same conditions as for the @xmath224 setting .",
    "a huge amount of work still needs to be envisaged for analyzing the effect of baselines with non - negligible component @xmath9 in radio interferometry .",
    "we comment here on three important points .",
    "firstly , all our results should be confirmed for various levels of instrumental noise before stronger conclusions are drawn . in particular",
    ", possible implications of the spreading of the signal energy on all spatial frequencies probed due to the chirp modulation should be studied as a function of the noise level on each visibility .    secondly , we assumed perfect knowledge of a sparsity dictionary made up of simple gaussian waveforms .",
    "a large range of multi - scale dictionaries , notably wavelet frames , may be used in which a large variety of natural signals are known to be sparse or compressible .",
    "let us however acknowledge the fact that a non - optimal choice of a sparsity dictionary will of course have an effect on the sparsity and possibly degrade the reconstruction .",
    "in this perspective , further analyses should be performed in order to assess the suitability of specific dictionaries .    for signals with sparse or compressible gradients",
    ", a tv norm may be substituted for the @xmath132 norm of the coefficients in the sparsity dictionary , in the very definition of the minimization problem .",
    "the tv norm of a signal is simply defined as the @xmath132 norm of the magnitude of its gradient @xcite .",
    "a theoretical result of exact reconstruction holds for such tv norm minimization problems in the case of fourier measurements of signals with exactly sparse gradients in the absence of noise @xcite . but",
    "no proof of stability relative to noise and compressibility exists .",
    "such minimization is also accessible through an iterative scheme from convex optimization algorithms @xcite . even though our signals would not primarily be thought to have very sparse gradients , the gaussian waveforms have in practice well defined contours .",
    "preliminary reconstruction results using this scheme actually show promising reconstruction qualities .",
    "thirdly , further analyses should also be performed in order to understand the effect of the chirp modulation for realistic distributions of the baseline components @xmath7 , and in particular for non - constant component @xmath9 .",
    "however , let us already note from the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] that , for each size @xmath204 of the gaussian waveforms , the @xmath234 of the @xmath228 reconstruction rises very steeply with the number of visibilities measured @xmath93 , before saturating around some multiple of the sparsity @xmath188 .",
    "this suggests a selection procedure in cases where the total number of visibilities measured is very large relative to the sparsity considered .",
    "if a suitable fraction of visibilities is associated with the suitable coverage of frequencies @xmath94 in the fourier plane and with a suitable identical value of @xmath9 , only these visibilities might be retained in the problem .",
    "in such a case , our present considerations could apply directly .",
    "let us also recall that the value @xmath184 requires a strong alignment of the baselines with the pointing direction for small fields of view , possibly corresponding to an unrealistically large component @xmath9 . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath228 reconstruction results are asymptotic values .",
    "however , a given baseline component @xmath9 will actually correspond to a larger @xmath211 on a larger field of view @xmath238 and for a given band limit @xmath208 , so that @xmath184 will become more realistic .",
    "this is actually the exact opposite argument to the one used for the definition of faceting algorithms , which decompose a given field of view on subfields where the effect of @xmath9 is negligible . in that regard , the extension of our results on wide fields of view on",
    "the celestial sphere will be essential @xcite , notably with regard to forthcoming radio interferometers such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) @xcite .",
    "we have focused our attention on radio interferometers with small field of view and baselines with non - negligible and constant component in the pointing direction , for which a linear chirp modulation affects the astrophysical signals probed .",
    "considering simple sparse signals made up of gaussian waveforms , we have discussed the sensitivity of imaging techniques relative to the sparsity dictionary in the context of the theory of compressed sensing . a theoretical computation of the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing dictionaries , as well as the results of our numerical simulations , suggest the universality of the spread spectrum phenomenon relative to the sparsity dictionary , in terms of the achievable quality of reconstruction through the @xmath131 problem .",
