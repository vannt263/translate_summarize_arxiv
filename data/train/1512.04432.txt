    "in recent years there has been a quick growth of the number of papers dealing with statistical properties of dynamical systems with holes .",
    "the origin of these studies can be found in the paper @xcite , where it was posed the question about the statistical properties of the motion of a particle inside a billiard table with a small hole .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is the probability that a trajectory remains on the table until time @xmath1 , what is the decay rate of @xmath0 ? in general , they asked whether an initial distribution would converge , under suitable renormalization , to some limit distribution , a conditionally invariant measure .",
    "much attention to these problems has been paid also by the physics community , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .    in a general dynamical system ,",
    "the first question posed in @xcite has become the following : let @xmath2 be the phase space of a dynamical system with @xmath3 a distribution of initial conditions ; let @xmath4 be a hole in the space @xmath2 ; let @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the set of surviving points up to time @xmath1 ; study the decay rate @xmath7 which is called the _",
    "escape rate_. the existence of the limit and its dependence on the initial distribution @xmath3 has been studied in @xcite , where it is shown that in the ideal case it is possible to compute the escape rate by using the transfer operator associated to the system .",
    "let @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 be a smooth map with a finite number of pre - images for each @xmath10 , then the _ transfer operator _ associated to @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 the operator @xmath13 has spectral radius less or equal than 1 , and if there exists a function @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is an @xmath11-invariant measure .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more properties of the transfer operators .",
    "when there is a hole @xmath4 in @xmath2 , one can consider the _ transfer operator for the open system _",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the indicatrix function of the set @xmath4 .",
    "namely the transfer operator for the open system considers only pre - images of a point @xmath10 which are not in the hole @xmath4 .",
    "then the escape rate is obtained by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath21 .",
    "the escape rate has been largely studied mainly for hyperbolic systems and piecewise expanding maps of the interval .",
    "we refer to @xcite for references . in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying the behavior of the escape rate as the hole shrinks .",
    "rigorous results on this asymptotic behavior are given in @xcite for piecewise expanding maps of the interval , for which it is found that if @xmath22 then @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "higher order corrections can be found in @xcite .    however , it is well known that statistical properties of dynamical systems dramatically change passing from uniformly hyperbolic systems to intermittent ones , that is systems which have an indifferent fixed point . and in particular when the intermittent system preserves only one absolutely continuous invariant measure which is infinite .",
    "intermittent systems have been introduced in the mathematical physics literature in @xcite as a simple model of the phenomenon of intermittency , that is the alternation of a turbulent and a laminar phase in a fluid . as dynamical systems on the unit interval",
    "@xmath25 $ ] , they may be represented by the family of maps @xmath26 ( mod 1 ) , with @xmath27 , which have a fixed point at @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31 . for @xmath32",
    "the system has a finite absolutely continuous invariant measure . for this case",
    ", the escape rate has been recently studied in @xcite , where it is shown that the probability @xmath0 may decrease polynomially , so in the definition of @xmath33 one should divide by @xmath34 .",
    "however the results in @xcite consider the case of a hole @xmath4 which is generated by the markov partition of the map , and such that the indifferent fixed point is outside @xmath4 .",
    "hence the polynomial escape rate is a consequence of the typical slower decay of correlations found for intermittent systems .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case of an intermittent dynamical system with infinite absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "this corresponds to values @xmath35 in the example @xmath26 ( mod 1 ) .",
    "this case has been recently studied by g. knight and s. munday in @xcite .",
    "they study the asymptotic behavior of the escape rate for vanishing hole and prove that different behaviors are possible .",
    "their methods are analytical and use the definition of the _ dynamical zeta function _ associated to a system , and in particular the relations with the transfer operator . however , to apply these methods they have to consider piecewise linear maps and holes which are generated by the partition associated to the map . to give a flavor of their results , we consider a typical example of intermittent dynamical system on the interval @xmath25 $ ] with infinite measure , the _ farey map_. the farey map is defined by @xmath36 \\frac{1-x}{x}\\ , , & \\mbox{if } \\",

    "its graph is shown in figure [ gr - farey ] .        in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider a piecewise version of @xmath11 , which is obtained by considering the partition @xmath37 and defining @xmath38 \\frac{n+1}{n-1}\\ , x - \\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\\ , , & \\mbox{if } \\",

    "more general behavior are found in @xcite by varying the partition @xmath41 with @xmath42 , but always choosing a hole of the form @xmath43 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the escape rate for the farey map with hole @xmath44 , and its asymptotic behavior as @xmath45 . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first case where this problem is studied in such a generality for an infinite measure preserving dynamical system .",
    "we use to compute the escape rate through the transfer operator @xmath21 associated to @xmath11 with a hole @xmath4 .",
    "the main problem is that due to the presence of the indifferent fixed point , the transfer operator of the farey map does nt have the so - called _ spectral gap _ , that is a gap between the maximal eigenvalue and the essential spectrum , independently of the smoothness of functions on which the operator is applied ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral gap is found for example in the study of the transfer operator of expanding maps , when restricted to the space of bounded variation functions , and is fundamental to obtain exponential decay of correlations for the map and is used also in @xcite to study the asymptotic behavior of the escape rate .",
    "a good space of functions @xmath46 on which to study the spectral properties of the transfer operator of the farey map has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "it consists of holomorphic functions on the disc @xmath47 obtained as integral transform of functions on the positive real axis ( see below ) .",
    "so we should consider the action of @xmath21 on @xmath46 .",
    "unfortunately , since the indicatrix function @xmath18 is not real analytic , we have to introduce an approximation of @xmath18 .",
    "hence we study the escape rate for the farey map with approximated holes which contain the indifferent fixed point , and are general in the sense that we do nt require any relation between the length of the hole and the map .    in section [ sec :",
    "to ] we introduce the operator @xmath21 and its approximation @xmath48 , obtained by approximating the function @xmath18 with a real analytic function . in section [ sec : ma ] we introduce the approach we use to study the spectral properties of @xmath48 , and show our results . the conclusions of our study are exposed in the final section .",

    "<S> we study the escape rate for the farey map , an infinite measure preserving system , with a hole including the indifferent fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> due to the ergodic properties of the map , the standard theoretical approaches to this problem can not be applied . to overcome this difficulties we propose here to consider approximations of the hole by means of real analytic functions . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a particular family of approximations and study numerically the behavior of the escape rate for `` shrinking '' approximated holes . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the scaling of the escape rate depends on the chosen approximation , but `` converges '' to the behavior found for piecewise linear approximations of the map in @xcite . </S>"
