    "this paper is organized as follows : we first describe the zcosmos - deep sample and the mock catalogues used to calibrate and analyze our group catalogue . in section 3 we develop our group - finder algorithm on the basis of comparisons with the mocks , and produce the catalogue of 42 associations . in section 4 we carry out an extensive analysis of the mocks to see what they indicate for ( a ) the nature of the structures that we detect at @xmath12 , ( b ) how they develop over time , down to @xmath13 , and  how representative they are of the population of progenitors of massive haloes today . in section 5",

    "the structure and presentation of the millennium simulation allows us to follow both haloes and individual galaxies through time and therefore to determine the subsequent evolution of group - like structures that are identified at a particular redshift ( lemson et al .",
    "it is therefore ideal for the present purposes of trying to understand the physical nature of corresponding objects in the sky , provided of course that the simulation , and the associated galaxy formation model , are not grossly inconsistent with the real universe .    in this work",
    "we make extensive use of the six independent @xcite mock lightcones which provide `` observations '' of a @xmath37 field and in which the identities of the galaxies are linked to the millennium simulation .",

    "the mocks give the positions of galaxies in ra and dec , as well as the observed redshifts , including the effects of peculiar velocities .",
    "for the mock catalogues to resemble the zcosmos - deep sample we first add a straightforward observational velocity error to each galaxy by adding a velocity selected randomly from a gaussian distribution with @xmath40km / s .",
    "the main concern is to match the number densities of galaxies in the actual zcosmos sample and in the mocks .",
    "starting with the set of all galaxies in the mocks , we applied limiting magnitudes in @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "small adjustments to the nominal @xmath22 and @xmath43 limits were then made above and below @xmath8 so as to match as well as possible the shape of the @xmath44 number counts of objects in the actual data , i.e. , so that @xmath45 was minimized . given the overall sampling ( spatial sampling times spectroscopic success rate ) of zcosmos - deep in this redshift range , we constructed , through these small magnitude adjustments , a mock sample that had exactly twice the surface number density as the final spectroscopic sample in the highly sampled central region .",
    "this meant a final division of the mock sample into two via random sampling could be used to simulate the @xmath1750% sampling of the spectroscopic data and yield a second , complementary , mock sample from the same light cone .",
    "this is useful to see the effects of the sampling as well as doubling the number of mock samples .",
    "it should be emphasized that the goal of this exercise was to produce a mock sample that had the correct @xmath44 and was similarly dominated by star - forming galaxies ( by making similar nominal cuts in b and k as in the zcosmos selection ) , rather than to simulate exactly the selection of the objects .",
    "such an exact simulation would have depended on the details of the galaxy formation prescription used in the sam prescription , and on the uncertain vagaries of the zcosmos - deep spectroscopic success rate etc .",

    "a major concern is the over - merging or fragmentation of groups and a great deal of effort goes into controlling these issues ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "many group - finders use a friends - of - friends method to link galaxies into structures . in choosing the linking lengths @xmath47 ( in physical space ) and @xmath46 one has to take into consideration the following , sometimes contradicting , requirements :    * the linking length has to be large enough to ideally encompass all groups that are present , but small enough for not to overmerge groups ,",

    "the choice of values for the linking lengths is therefore a compromise .",
    "we explored the performance of the group - finder with varying linking lengths with the mock catalogues , determining for each resulting group catalogue the total number of candidate groups , the total number of real groups plus proto - groups , and the fraction of real ( proto-)groups , i.e. , the fraction of the detected structures at @xmath9 which either constitute a group already then , or will do so by @xmath35 .",
    "this is shown as a function of linking length in figure [ fig_varll ] .",
    "it turns out that the number of real ( proto-)groups stays largely constant with increasing velocity linking length beyond @xmath50km / s , but increases with linking length @xmath47 .",
    "the total number of candidate groups however increases steadily with both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , meaning that the fraction of real ( proto-)groups decreases with @xmath46 and with @xmath47 .",
    "we set a fraction of real ( proto-)groups of 50% as a minimum requirement .",
    "the remaining 50% of the sample will contain a significant number of partial ( proto-)groups , which will increase the success rate ( see section 4.1 ) . because of the initial upturn in the number of real ( proto-)groups we also want to have @xmath49km / s .",
    "it then turns out that the maximal linking length @xmath47 ( physical space ) that fulfills these two requirements is 500 kpc .",
    "the @xmath51kpc and @xmath52km / s are slightly higher values than for instance in @xcite , who uses 300 - 400kpc and @xmath17 400km / s .",

    "93% of the mock candidate groups will either fully ( @xmath69% ) or partially ( @xmath70% ) assemble by the present epoch . the main criterion that distinguishes proto - groups from partial or spurious ones",

    "will have merged together by the current epoch , and in about 10% all three members will have merged into a single massive galaxy .      in the preceding discussion we followed the evolution of the structures that were detected by our group - finder at @xmath8 down to the present epoch . in this section",
    "we look at haloes at the present epoch and ask which of their progenitors could have been detected at @xmath75 in a zcosmos - like survey . to do this , we examine the set of all present - day haloes in the simulation whose progenitors lie within the @xmath10 volume of any of the six light cones .",
    "we first identify at the earlier epoch all of the haloes that will eventually assemble into a given present - day halo , and then identify all the `` progenitor galaxies '' within these progenitor haloes and ask if they satisfy the zcosmos brightness selection criteria , without the 50% spatial sampling , referring to these as `` zcosmos - selected '' galaxies .",
    "we then additionally ask whether this set of `` progenitor galaxies '' would have satisfied our group - funding requirements in terms of their spatial and velocity displacements , adding in also the incomplete spatial    , as a function of the present - day dark matter mass of the halo .",
    "the light blue region shows haloes which today contain three or more galaxies that , at high redshift , would satisfy the zcosmos - deep photometric selection criteria and would have been recognized as a candidate group with the zcosmos - deep overall sampling and success rates .",
    "the dark blue region represents candidate groups that were not recognized simply because of the incomplete sampling / success rate - the lack of these in our candidate group catalogue was therefore simply a matter of chance .",
    "the pink region represents haloes in which the constituent galaxies would have been observed in zcosmos - deep , but which were too dispersed , in projected distance or velocity , to satisfy our group - finding algorithm .",
    "the darker grey region represents present - day haloes which only had one or two progenitor galaxies satisfying the zcosmos - deep photometric criteria , while the light grey region represents haloes in which none of the progenitor galaxies could have been in zcosmos - deep . around 65% of all present day",
    "@xmath1m@xmath76/h groups would have a progenitor structure at @xmath77 which we would in principle be able to identify in zcosmos - deep with full sampling .",
    "bottom panel : as in the upper panel , but now the the total number of haloes is plotted instead of the fraction . ]    sampling of the zcosmos survey .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig_haloes ] .",
    "many haloes today , especially at @xmath78m@xmath76/h , do not have any zcosmos - selected progenitor galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "these are represented as the light grey region of the upper panel .",
    "some have only one or two zcosmos - selected progenitor galaxies and they are shown in dark grey , since they will by definition not be recognized as a `` proto - group '' .",
    "the pink region represents haloes today whose progenitor haloes did contain three or more zcosmos - selected galaxies but which were , at @xmath10 , too dispersed to satisfy our group - finding linking lengths . finally , the blue region represents haloes with three or more progenitor galaxies that are close enough to be recognized as a candidate `` group '' . applying the 50% sampling of the zcosmos - survey , about a half of these are actually recognized ( light blue ) , the remainder are missed simply because of the incomplete spatial sampling of the survey .    at high present - day halo masses ( above @xmath79m@xmath76/h )",
    "the majority of the haloes are represented in our candidate group catalogue in the sense of detecting three or more progenitor galaxies and recognizing them as members of a candidate group structure . in other words , around 65% of todays @xmath80m@xmath76/h haloes should in principle have been recognized as a candidate group with the galaxy selection criteria of zcosmos , although a half of these will not have been detected in practice because of the random 50% sampling of our survey .",
    "of the remaining 35% of present - day haloes above @xmath79m@xmath76/h that we would not have expected to be able to detect , more than a half have three or more detectable progenitor galaxies , but these are too dispersed in space or velocity to satisfy our criteria . increasing the linking lengths to catch these dispersed systems would , as shown above",
    ", however also severely increase the number of interlopers .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig_haloes ] shows the distribtion of the present - day halo masses of the systems in our candidate group catalogue .",
    "while , as noted in the previous paragraphs , we are detecting a high fraction of the progenitors of the most massive haloes today , we are evidently detecting a broad range of present - day halo masses with most systems in the @xmath81m@xmath76/h range .        in order to give a rough estimate for the overdensities @xmath82 associated with the candidate groups we calculated the mean ( comoving ) density @xmath83 of the overall sample in bins of @xmath84 using the following equation : @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes",
    "the comoving distance along the line - of - sight and @xmath87 is the field of view of the mocks ( 1.4@xmath88x1.4@xmath88 ) .",
    "the density of the groups @xmath89 was determined by assuming a cylinder with radius @xmath59 and a length of twice the @xmath54 ( in comoving units ) : @xmath90 where @xmath33 is the number of members , @xmath86 the length of the cylinder , and the factor 0.27 is included to account for the fact that in a 3d gaussian distribution only this fraction of the points would actually lie within the @xmath91 region ( which we assumed here , by setting the size of the cylinder to the @xmath59 and the @xmath54 ) .",
    "the overdensity computed here is at best a rough order of magnitude estimate .",
    "first , it refers to the density within the r.m.s .",
    "radius containing only a fraction of the observed galaxies , leading to an over - estimate of the mean overdensities of all of the galaxies in the structure .",
    "an additional effect comes from the 50% sampling rate . adding in the missing galaxies",
    "does not add significant numbers of new members to the detected associations ( since they were the lucky ones with above average sampling ) , whereas the mean density of the field increases by a factor of two , leading to a factor of up to two over - estimate in the overdensity .",
    "on the other hand , due the effect of measurement errors in redshift ( of order 300km / s ) as well as peculiar velocities in that , the `` size '' along the line of sight may have been substantially over - estimated leading to an underestimate of the actual overdensity , e.g. , by almost an order of magnitude since the observed @xmath54 corresponds to about 8mpc ( comoving ) against the typical @xmath59 of @xmath92mpc ( comoving ) .",
    "the estimated over densities should therefore be treated with considerable caution .      with these caveats in mind ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath93 for the 42 candidate groups and for the corresponding mock samples is shown in figure [ fig_deltadistr ] . even with the uncertainties outlined above , it is evident that that the candidate groups represent highly overdense regions and that most of them have probably already turned around ( i.e. , decoupled from the background ) .",
    "this would be expected if they are to merge into a single halo within an interval of expansion factor of @xmath94 as discussed above .",
    "so far we have established that the associations that we have found are in the main not yet fully formed groups , but are quite likely to become so by @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the candidate groups are already quite overdense .",
    "for this reason it is of interest to look for surrounding overdensities and to look for any colour - differentiation of the galaxy population in and around the candidate groups relative to the field population . unfortunately",
    ", zcosmos - deep itself is limited to star - forming galaxies by the colour selection , and so it is necessary to use photo-@xmath4 objects from the larger and deeper cosmos photometric sample ( capak et al .",
    "typical photo-@xmath4 errors are of order of @xmath95 or 10000km / s .",
    "we focus on relatively massive galaxies , above a stellar mass of @xmath96m@xmath76 so that the photo-@xmath4 errors are not excessive and so that the photo-@xmath4 catalogue is complete in stellar mass .",
    "most of these objects have @xmath97 .",
    "we first search for any excess of galaxies around the locations of the candidate groups .",
    "we consider cylinders with radii that are a varying multiple of the group @xmath59 and which have a fixed length of twice 10000km / s .",
    "we lay down 42 cylinders , one over each group , and compare the total number of massive ( @xmath96m@xmath76 ) galaxies in these cylinders to the totals found when the 42 cylinders are laid down at positions that have the same @xmath98 but random ( ra , dec ) positions , repeating these random samples 1000 times and using the variation in the random samples to give an estimate of the noise to be expected in the group sample .    especially at small multiples of @xmath59",
    "a significant excess is seen around the candidate groups as shown in figure [ fig_excesshighmass ] .",
    "m@xmath76 ) galaxies from the cosmos photo-@xmath4 sample around our spectroscopic candidate groups , relative to the field , as a function of the projected distance from the group in units of the @xmath59 of the groups as seen in cylinders of depth @xmath99km / s to accommodate photo-@xmath4 errors ( see text for details ) . at the position of the candidate groups we find a projected excess of up to @xmath1740% in the number of massive galaxies (",
    "blue filled circles ) .",
    "this fraction reduces to @xmath1725% if we subtract out the already known spectroscopic members ( red open circles ) and also reduces to insignificance at large radii .",
    "this concentrated mean overdensity suggests that our candidate groups indeed trace significant overdensities in the universe . ]    at the position of the candidate groups within a @xmath100 radius we find @xmath17 40% more massive objects around the group positions as in the general field , whereas this fraction drops for larger radii and is consistent with unity at @xmath101 , which corresponds to @xmath102mpc ( physical ) .",
    "this excess is only slightly reduced when the spectroscopically observed objects are excluded ( red circles in figure [ fig_excesshighmass ] ) , and the excess seen in this independent dataset provides further evidence that the candidate groups catalogued in this paper are real physical associations and not just chance projections .",
    "next we look at the distribution of colours in the photo-@xmath4 sample around the candidate groups with respect to the field . for this",
    "we consider cylinders with a fixed radius of @xmath103 and the same length of twice 10000km / s as above .",
    "we define red galaxies to be galaxies with @xmath104 and consider a red fraction which is the number of red galaxies at a given stellar mass divided by the total number of galaxies at that mass .",
    "figure [ fig_redfraction ] shows the red fractions as function of stellar mass .",
    "sample at the position of our candidate groups ( in red ) as compared to the field ( in blue ) as a function of stellar mass .",
    "red galaxies are defined to have rest - frame @xmath104 , using the spectral energy distributions used to estimate their photometric redshifts .",
    "we find that there is no difference in the colours for the field and the candidate groups .",
    "this is , however , not surprising if the candidate groups are only starting to assemble and if environmental differentiation is confined to satellites , as indicated at lower redshifts . ]",
    "it is clear that the fraction of red objects in the candidate groups and in the field , at fixed stellar mass , is essentially the same and we do not see evidence of color segregation with environment .",
    "of course , given the large cylinder length in redshift ( of order @xmath105 around the group location ) , our `` group sample '' will have been heavily contaminated by unrelated foreground and background field galaxies : our overdensity of 40% suggests that also 70% of the photo-@xmath4 `` group sample '' galaxies are projected from the field .",
    "these projected galaxies will of course heavily dilute any intrinsic color difference and we could in principle subtract these projected galaxies statistically .",
    "however , because the red fractions are so indistinguishable , we have not attempted to do this .",
    "it is not clear that any such environmental segregation , at fixed stellar mass , should have been expected .",
    "we have argued above that the galaxies in the candidate groups are in general unlikely , at the epoch at which we observe them , to be sharing the same dark matter halo .",
    "a correspondingly small fraction of the galaxies will be satellites , even in the larger photo-@xmath4 sample .",
    "various papers ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2008 , font et al .",
    "2008 , weinmann et al .",
    "2009 , prescott et al .",
    "2011 , peng et al .",
    "2012 , and many others ) have presented clear evidence that all of the environmental differentiation of the galaxy population at low redshift is associated with the quenching of star - formation in satellite galaxies , and there is now also good evidence that this remains true also at redshifts approaching unity ( kovac et al .",
    "2012 in prep . )",
    "we have applied a group - finder with linking lengths @xmath51kpc ( physical ) and @xmath52km / s to the zcosmos - deep sample of 3502 galaxies at @xmath0 , yielding 42 systems with three or more members . to try to understand what these associations likely are , and what they will probably become , we have constructed an analogous sample from 12 zcosmos - deep mock samples which were extracted from the millennium simulation mock catalogues of @xcite , supplemented by a single light cone from the @xcite simulation which has a more realistic value of @xmath106 .    we refer to the detected systems as `` candidate groups '' .",
    "we have introduced the following terminology in which a system in which all three detected members are in the same halo is called a `` real group '' and one in which only two are , a `` partial group '' .",
    "candidate groups that will become real or partial groups by @xmath38 are called `` proto - groups '' and `` partial proto - groups '' respectively .",
    "the number of candidate groups in the simulations agrees quite well with the number in the sky .",
    "however , analysis of the simulated candidate groups suggests that only a very small fraction , less than 0.2% in the @xcite sample and none in the wang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) sample , already have all the detected galaxies occupying the same halo at the time of observation , i.e. , are already `` real groups '' .",
    "about 8% of the candidate groups will however already have two members within the same halo in the @xcite sample .",
    "furthermore , 50% of the mock candidate groups will have assembled all three galaxies into the same halo by @xmath38 ( i.e. , are `` proto - groups '' at the epoch of observation ) and almost all ( 93% ) will have at least two galaxies in the same halo .",
    "only 7% are truly random associations whose members will never occupy the same halo .",
    "the mocks suggest that the important parameter that distinguishes the fate of the candidate group is the apparent velocity dispersion @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath107km / s the fraction of system that will fully assemble all three members is above @xmath108 and for larger dispersions it is lower .",
    "the fraction does not depend much on the projected angular size of the candidate groups .",
    "the observed candidate groups are being seen as they begin the assembly process . already by @xmath109 ( which is the lower limit of our observational window ) around @xmath110 of the candidate groups ( observed at @xmath0 )",
    "will be partial - groups , the bulk of them doing so within @xmath111 from their epoch of detection , and within @xmath112 most proto - groups will have evolved into real or partial groups .",
    "if we look at today s groups and ask which of their progenitors will have been seen in our spectroscopic sample at @xmath75 , then we find that we should have detected @xmath113 of the progenitors of todays massive clusters ( of order of @xmath80m@xmath76/h ) already at @xmath9 and this would rise to @xmath114 if we had 100% completeness in the zcosmos - deep spectroscopic sample .    we can roughly estimate the overdensities of the spectroscopically detected structures and find that these are substantial , consistent with the idea that these systems will soon come together into assembled systems .",
    "we also detect a significant overdensity in the regions of these candidate groups using independent the cosmos photometric sample , which shows a 40% excess in the numbers of galaxies above @xmath3m@xmath2 at the location of our spectroscopic candidate groups as compared to the field , despite the very large sampling cylinders ( @xmath115 ) required from the use of photo-@xmath4 .",
    "we do not however detect any significant differentiation in the colours of the galaxies compared to the field .",
    "however , we might not have expected to see such differences if most of the structures are still assembling on account of the fact that at @xmath5 environmental differentiation of the galaxy population is confined to satellite galaxies .",
    "this research is based on observations undertaken at the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) under the large program 175.a-0839 and has been supported by the swiss national science foundation ( snf ) .      the millennium simulation databases used in this paper and the web application providing online access to them were constructed as part of the activities of the german astrophysical virtual observatory .",
