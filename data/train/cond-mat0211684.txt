    "real traffic is a dynamical process which occurs both in space and time .",
    "this spatial - temporal process shows very complex dynamical behavior",
    ". in particular , highway traffic can be either free or congested .",
    "congested traffic states can be defined as the traffic states where the average vehicle speed is lower than the minimum possible average speed in free flow ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that in contrast to free traffic flow , in congested traffic a collective behavior of vehicles plays an important role ( the collective flow by prigogine and herman  @xcite ) , and a synchronization of vehicle speeds across different highway lanes usually occurs  @xcite . in congested traffic ,",
    "complex spatial - temporal patterns are observed , in particular a sequence of moving traffic jams , the so called `` stop - and - go '' phenomenon ( e.g. , the classical works by treiterer  @xcite and koshi _ et al . _",
    "recall that _ a moving jam _ is a moving localized structure .",
    "the moving jam is spatially restricted by two upstream moving jam fronts where the vehicle speed and the density change sharply .",
    "the vehicle speed is low ( as low as zero ) and the density is high inside the moving jam .",
    "congested traffic usually occurs at a highway bottleneck , e.g. , at the bottleneck due to an on - ramp . in empirical investigations ,",
    "the onset of congested traffic is accompanied by the breakdown phenomenon , i.e. , by a sharp decrease in the vehicle speed at the bottleneck ( see e.g. , papers by athol and bullen  @xcite , banks  @xcite , hall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , elefteriadou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , kerner and rehborn  @xcite and by persaud _",
    "et al . _",
    "it has been found that the breakdown phenomenon has a probabilistic nature , i.e. , the probability of the speed breakdown is an increasing function of the flow rate in free flow at the bottleneck  @xcite . besides , it has been found that the capacity of congested bottleneck , i.e. , highway capacity after the breakdown phenomenon at the bottleneck has occurred is usually lower than the capacity in free flow before - the so called phenomenon `` capacity drop ''  @xcite .    concerning the important role of highway bottlenecks",
    "it should be noted that although congested traffic can occur away from bottlenecks  @xcite , they have an important impact just like defects in physical systems which can play an important role for the phase transitions and for the formation of spatial - temporal patterns .",
    "the role of the bottlenecks in traffic flow is as follows : congested traffic occurs most frequently at highway bottlenecks ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the bottlenecks can result from for example due to road works , on and off ramps , a decrease in the number of highway lanes , road curves and road gradients .",
    "although the complexity of traffic is linked to the occurrence of spatial - temporal patterns , some of the traffic features can be understood if _",
    "average _ traffic characteristics are considered .",
    "thus , important empirical methods in traffic science are empirical flow - density and speed - density relationships which are related to measurements of some _ average _ traffic variables at a highway location , in particular at a highway bottleneck .",
    "the empirical relationship of the _ average _ vehicle speed on the vehicle density must be related to an obvious result observed in real traffic flow : the higher the vehicle density , the lower the average vehicle speed . when the flow rate , which is the product of the vehicle density and the average vehicle speed , is plotted as a function of the vehicle density one gets what is known as the empirical fundamental diagram .",
    "it must be noted that the empirical fundamental diagram is successfully used for different important applications where some average traffic flow characteristics should be determined ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    over the past 80 years",
    "scientists have developed a wide range of different mathematical models of traffic flow to understand these complex non - linear traffic phenomena ( see the books by leuzbach  @xcite , by may  @xcite , by daganzo  @xcite , by prigogine and herman  @xcite , by wiedemann  @xcite , by whitham  @xcite , by cremer  @xcite , by newell  @xcite , the reviews by chowdhury _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , helbing  @xcite , nagatani  @xcite , nagel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and the conference proceedings  @xcite ) .",
    "clearly these models must be based on the real behavior of drivers in traffic , and their solutions should show phenomena observed in real traffic .      up to now by a development of a mathematical traffic flow model which should explain empirical spatial - temporal congested patterns , it has been self - evident that hypothetical _ steady _ state solutions of the model should belong to a curve in the flow - density plane ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and the recent reviews  @xcite ) . the above term _ steady state _ designates the hypothetical model solution where vehicles move at the same distances to one another with the same time - independent vehicle speed .",
    "therefore , steady states are hypothetical spatially homogeneous and time - independent traffic states ( steady states are also often called `` homogeneous '' or `` equilibrium '' model solutions ; we will use in the article for these hypothetical model traffic states the term `` steady '' states or `` steady speed '' states ) .",
    "the curve in the flow - density plane for steady state model solutions goes through the origin and has at least one maximum .",
    "this curve is called _ the fundamental diagram _ for traffic flow .",
    "the postulate about the fundamental diagram underlies almost all traffic flow modeling approaches up to now ( see reviews  @xcite ) in the sense that the models are constructed such that in the _ unperturbed , noiseless limit _ they have a fundamental diagram of steady states , i.e. , the steady states form a curve in the flow - density plane . the fundamental diagram is either a result of the model ( e.g. , for the models by gazis , herman , rothery  @xcite , gipps  @xcite , nagel - schreckenberg cellular automata ( ca for short )  @xcite , krau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , helbing , treiber and co - workers  @xcite , tomer , halvin and co - worker  @xcite ) or the fundamental diagram is hypothesized in a model ( e.g. , the optimal velocity models by newell  @xcite , whitham  @xcite , bando , sugiyama and co - workers  @xcite and the macroscopic model by payne  @xcite ) . moving jams which are calculated from these models for a homogeneous road ( i.e. , a road without bottlenecks ) are due to the instability of steady states of the fundamental diagram within some range of vehicle densities ( see reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we find it helpful to classify these models as belonging to what we call the \" fundamental diagram approach  .",
    "in 1955 lighthill and whitham  @xcite wrote in their classical work ( see page 319 in  @xcite ) : `` ... the fundamental hypothesis of the theory is that at any point of the road the flow ( vehicles per hour ) is a function of the concentration ( vehicles per mile ) ... '' .",
    "apparently the empirical fundamental diagram was the reason that the fundamental diagram approach has already been introduced in the first traffic flow models derived by lighthill and whitham  @xcite , by gasis , herman and rothery  @xcite , and by newell  @xcite .",
    "concerning the theoretical fundamental diagram , it must be noted that in real congested traffic complex spatial - temporal traffic patterns are observed ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these patterns are spatially non - homogeneous .",
    "this spatial behavior of congested patterns is a complex function of time .",
    "an averaging of traffic variables related to congested patterns over long enough time intervals gives a relation between different _ averaged _ vehicle speeds and densities .",
    "thus , the empirical fundamental diagram is related to _ averaged _ characteristics of spatial - temporal congested patterns measured at a highway location rather than to features of the hypothetical steady states of congested traffic on the theoretical fundamental diagram .",
    "for this reason , the existence of the theoretical fundamental diagram is only _",
    "a hypothesis_.    it has recently been found that empirical features of the phase transitions in traffic flow and most of empirical spatial - temporal pattern features  @xcite are qualitatively different from those which follow from mathematical traffic flow models in the fundamental diagram approach which is considered in the reviews  @xcite .",
    "for this reason in 1996 - 2000 the author , based on an empirical traffic flow analysis , introduced a concept called `` synchronized flow '' and the related three - phase traffic theory  @xcite .      in the concept `` synchronized",
    "flow '' , there are two qualitatively different phases , the traffic phase called `` synchronized flow '' and the traffic phase called `` wide moving jam '' , which should be distinguished in congested traffic  @xcite .",
    "this distinguishing is based on qualitatively different _ empirical spatial - temporal _ features of these phases .",
    "traffic consists of free flow and congested traffic .",
    "congested traffic consists of two traffic phases .",
    "thus , there are three traffic phases :    1 .   free flow .",
    "2 .   synchronized flow .",
    "3 .   wide moving jam .",
    "in the three - phase traffic theory , features of spatial - temporal congested patterns are explained based on the phase transitions between these three traffic phases .",
    "objective criteria to distinguish between the traffic phase `` synchronized flow '' and the traffic phase `` wide moving jam '' are based on qualitative different _ empirical spatial - temporal _ features of these two traffic phases .",
    "a wide moving jam is a moving jam which possesses the following characteristic feature .",
    "let us consider the downstream front of the wide moving jam where vehicles accelerate escaping from a standstill inside the wide moving jam .",
    "this downstream jam front propagates on a highway _ keeping _ the mean velocity of this front . as long as a moving jam is a wide moving jam this characteristic effect - the keeping of the velocity of the downstream jam front - remains even if the wide moving jam propagates through any complex traffic states and through any highway bottlenecks .",
    "in contrast , the downstream front of the traffic phase `` synchronized flow '' ( where vehicles accelerate escaping from synchronized flow to free flow ) is usually fixed at the bottleneck . corresponding to the definition of the traffic phase `` wide moving jam '' and to the concept `` synchronized flow '' where there are only two traffic phases in congested traffic , any state of congested traffic which does not possess the above characteristic feature of a wide moving jam is related to the traffic state `` synchronized flow '' .",
    "a more detailed consideration of the objective criteria of traffic phases and empirical examples of the application of these objective criteria for the determination of the phase `` synchronized flow '' and the phase `` wide moving jam '' in congested traffic can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the concept `` synchronized flow '' and the related methodology of the congested pattern study , which has been used for the definition of the three traffic phases below , is based on an analysis of _ empirical spatial - temporal _ features of congested patterns  @xcite rather than on a dynamical analysis of data ( e.g. , in the flow - density plane ) which is measured at only one highway location .",
    "first , a spatial - temporal study of traffic must be made . only after the traffic phases `` synchronized flow '' and `` wide moving jam '' have already been distinguished , based on this spatial - temporal data analysis , some of the pattern features can further be studied in the flow - density plane . in particular , this procedure has already been used in  @xcite : at the first step , a spatial - temporal analysis of empirical data has been made and the phases `` synchronized flow '' and `` wide moving jam '' have been identified . at the next step , the traffic phase `` synchronized flow '' has been plotted in the flow - density plane without any wide moving jams and some of the features of `` synchronized flow '' have been studied . measured data on sections of the highway a5 in germany which have been used in  @xcite also comprise the information about vehicle types ( number of vehicles and long vehicles ) and individual vehicle speeds passing the detector during each one minute interval of averaging . using the latter information in addition to the spatial - temporal data analysis of one minute",
    "averaged data , the determination of the type of synchronized flow in empirical studies of synchronized flow ( the type ( i ) , or ( ii ) or else ( iii )  @xcite ) have been made .",
    "besides , the individual vehicle speeds allow us to answer the question of whether there are narrow moving jams in synchronized flow or not . all these steps of data analysis have been made in  @xcite .",
    "we will illustrate this in sect .",
    "[ concept ] where an empirical example of a synchronized flow pattern will be studied .",
    "another claim of the concept of `` synchronized flow '' is the hypothesis about steady states of synchronized flow .",
    "this is the fundamental hypothesis of the three - phase traffic theory .",
    "the fundamental hypothesis of the three - phase traffic theory reads as follows  @xcite :    _ hypothetical steady states of synchronized flow cover a two - dimensional region in the flow - density plane _",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "this means that in these hypothetical steady states of synchronized flow , where all vehicles move at the same distance to one another and with the same time - independent speed , a given steady vehicle speed is related to an infinite multitude of different vehicle densities and a given vehicle density is related to an infinite multitude of different steady vehicle speeds .",
    "this hypothesis means that there is _ no _ fundamental diagram for hypothetical steady speed states of synchronized flow .",
    "this hypothesis has recently been used in a microscopic three - phase traffic flow theory  @xcite .",
    "it occurs that this theory , which is also based on other hypotheses of the three - phase traffic theory ( sect .",
    "[ com_sec ] ) , explains and predicts main features of empirical phase transitions and spatial - temporal congested patterns found in  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental hypothesis of the three - phase traffic theory is therefore in contradiction with the hypothesis about the existence of the fundamental diagram for hypothetical steady states of mathematical models and theories in the fundamental diagram approach .",
    "an explanation of the fundamental hypothesis of the three - phase traffic theory will be done in sect .",
    "[ exp_h_sec ] .",
    "the term `` synchronized flow '' should reflect the following features of this traffic phase : ( i ) it is a non - interrupted traffic flow rather than a long enough standstill as it usually occurs inside a wide moving jam .",
    "the word `` flow '' should reflect this feature .",
    "( ii ) there is a _ tendency _ to a synchronization of vehicle speeds across different lanes on a multi - lane road in this flow . besides",
    ", there is a _ tendency _ to a synchronization of vehicle speeds on each of the road lanes ( a bunching of the vehicles ) in synchronized flow due to a relatively low mean probability of passing in synchronized flow .",
    "the word `` synchronized '' should reflect these speed synchronization effects .",
    "the term `` wide moving jam '' should reflect the characteristic feature of the jam to propagate through any other states of traffic flow and through any bottlenecks keeping the velocity of the downstream jam front .",
    "the word combination `` moving jam '' should reflect the feature of the jam _ propagation _ as a whole localized structure on a road .",
    "if the width of a moving jam is considerably higher than the widths of the jam fronts and the speed inside the jam is zero then the moving jam possesses this characteristic feature . the word `` wide '' ( the jam width in the longitudinal direction ) should reflect this characteristic feature of the jam propagation _ keeping _ the velocity of the downstream jam front .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ concept ] , firstly an overview of known features of synchronized flow is made ( sect .",
    "[ syn_overview ] ) and then new empirical results about spatial - temporal features of synchronized flow are presented .",
    "these empirical results should help to understand some of the hypotheses to the three - phase traffic theory .",
    "a critical analysis of the application of the fundamental diagram approach for a description of phase transitions and of spatial - temporal features of congested patterns will be made in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] . in sect .",
    "[ com_sec ] , a comparison of already known hypotheses to the author s three - phase traffic theory with results of the fundamental diagram approach to traffic flow theory will be considered . in this section",
    ", we will also consider some new hypotheses about a z- and _ double _ z - shaped characteristics of traffic flow .",
    "the double z - characteristic should explain phase transitions which are responsible for the wide moving jam emergence in real traffic flow .",
    "other new results are presented in sect .",
    "[ cap_sec ] where a probabilistic theory of highway capacity which is based on the three - phase traffic theory is considered .",
    "this general theory will be illustrated and confirmed by new numerical results of a study of a kkw cellular automata model within the three - phase traffic theory .",
    "in this section some new empirical features of synchronized flow will be considered .",
    "these features will be used below for an explanation of the three - phase traffic theory . in particular , these results allow us to give the empirical basis for the hypothesis about a z - shape of the probability of passing in traffic flow as a function of the density .",
    "however , firstly a brief overview of empirical features of synchronized flow is made .      moving jams",
    "do not emerge in free flow , if synchronized flow is not hindered  @xcite .",
    "instead , the moving jams emerge due to a sequence of two first order phase transitions  @xcite : first the transition from free flow to synchronized flow occurs ( it is called the f@xmath0s transition ) and only later and usually at a different highway location wide moving jams emerge in the synchronized flow ( the latter transition is called the s@xmath0j transition and the sequence of both transitions is called the f@xmath0s@xmath0j transitions ) .",
    "in particular , the onset of congestion at a bottleneck , i.e. , the well - known breakdown phenomenon in free flow is linked to the f@xmath0s transition in an initial free flow rather than to the wide moving jam emergence ( the f@xmath0j transition )  @xcite .",
    "this means that at the same density in free flow at the bottleneck the probability of the f@xmath0s transition should be considerably higher than the probability of the f@xmath0j transition .",
    "empirical investigations show  @xcite that there are two main types of congested patterns at an isolated bottleneck : _ the general pattern _ or _",
    "gp _ for short : the gp is the congested pattern at the isolated bottleneck where synchronized flow occurs upstream of the bottleneck and wide moving jams spontaneously emerge in that synchronized flow .",
    "thus the gp consists of both traffic phases in congested traffic : `` synchronized flow '' and `` wide moving jam '' . _ the synchronized flow pattern _ or _ sp _ for short : the sp consists of synchronized flow upstream of the isolated bottleneck _ only _ , i.e. , _ no _ wide moving jams emerge in that synchronized flow .",
    "however , dependent on the bottleneck features and on traffic demand , the gp and the sp show a diverse variety of special cases .",
    "in particular , there are three main different types of synchronized flow patterns ( sp ) at the isolated bottleneck : the localized sp ( lsp ) , i.e. , the sp whose width is spatially limited over time , the widening sp ( wsp ) , i.e. , the sp whose width is continuously widening over time and the moving sp ( msp ) , i.e. , the sp which propagates as a whole localized pattern on the road .    the usual scenario of the gp emergence is the following  @xcite : first , the f@xmath0s transition occurs at a highway bottleneck .",
    "the downstream front of the synchronized flow ( the front where drivers escape from the synchronized flow upstream to the free flow downstream ) is fixed at the bottleneck .",
    "the upstream front of the synchronized flow ( this front separates free flow upstream from the synchronized flow downstream ) propagates upstream .",
    "later in this synchronized flow upstream of the bottleneck narrow moving jams spontaneously emerge .",
    "narrow moving jams propagate upstream and self - grow ] .",
    "finally , the growing narrow moving jams ( or only a part of them ) transform into wide moving jams .",
    "this transformation is related to the s@xmath0j transition .",
    "it must be noted that the well - known and very old term @xmath1stop - and - go@xmath1 traffic which is related to a sequence of moving traffic jams will not be used in this article .",
    "this is linked to the following : for a traffic observer , both a sequence of narrow moving jams and a sequence of wide moving jams is @xmath1stop - and - go@xmath1 traffic . however , as it has already been mentioned ( see footnote  [ fn_n_jam ] ) narrow moving jams belong to the traffic phase @xmath1synchronized flow@xmath1 whereas wide moving jams belong to the qualitatively different traffic phase @xmath1wide moving jam@xmath1 .",
    "it has been found that moving jams are most to emerge in dense synchronized flow of lower average vehicle speed  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the average speed in synchronized flow of a gp where a moving jam emerges is usually considerably lower than the speed in synchronized flow of a sp .",
    "the dense synchronized flow in gp appears due to the pinch effect in the synchronized flow , i.e. , due to a strong compression of the synchronized flow upstream of the bottleneck . besides , the lower the average speed in the pinch region of synchronized flow in a gp is the higher the frequency of the moving jam emergence in this synchronized flow .",
    "in particular , the average speed in the pinch region of synchronized flow is decreasing upstream of an on - ramp if the flow rate to the on - ramp is increasing .",
    "consequently the frequency of the moving jam emergence increases when the flow rate to the on - ramp increases .",
    "this is because the average speed in synchronized flow upstream of the on - ramp decreases .",
    "even at the highest observed flow rate to the on - ramp moving jams emerge ( with the highest frequency ) in synchronized flow upstream of the on - ramp .",
    "in contrast , empirical investigations of synchronized flow allow us to suggest that in synchronized flow of higher vehicle speed moving jams do not necessarily emerge  @xcite . in this case , a sp can occur where no wide moving jams emerge  @xcite .",
    "one of the sps is a wsp .",
    "the wsp should occur when a bottleneck introduces a relatively small disturbance for traffic flow .",
    "this case which can be observed at a bottleneck due to off - ramps will be considered below .",
    "it will be shown , that in this case synchronized flow in a wsp can indeed exist upstream of the bottleneck on a long stretch of the highway ( about 4.5 km ) during a long time ( more than 60 min ) without wide moving jam emergence in that synchronized flow .",
    "this confirms the above suggestion made that in synchronized flow of higher vehicle speed moving jams do not necessarily emerge .",
    "the gp and the sp which have briefly been discussed above appear at an isolated bottleneck . as a result ,",
    "an influence of the other bottlenecks on the pattern formation at the isolated bottleneck and on the pattern features should be negligible .    on real highways",
    "there are a lot of bottlenecks where different congested patterns almost simultaneously can emerge . if two ( or more ) such bottlenecks exist , then an expanded congested pattern ( ep ) can be formed . in the ep ,",
    "synchronized flow covers at least two bottlenecks .",
    "for example , let us consider two bottlenecks which are close to one another .",
    "the bottleneck downstream will be called `` downstream bottleneck '' and the bottleneck upstream will be called `` upstream bottleneck '' .",
    "if the f@xmath0s transition occurs at the downstream bottleneck and later narrow moving jams emerge in the synchronized flow , then narrow moving jams can reach the upstream bottleneck before they have transformed into wide moving jams . in this case , the synchronized flow propagates upstream of the upstream bottleneck covering both bottlenecks : an ep appears .    another empirical example which will be considered below is the following : if a wsp occurs at the downstream bottleneck , then due to the continuous upstream widening of synchronized flow in the wsp the upstream front of the synchronized flow always at some time reaches the upstream bottlneck .",
    "after the synchronized flow is upstream of the upstream bottleneck , the synchronized flow covers both bottlenecks , i.e. , the initial wsp transforms into an ep . from this example",
    "we may conclude that the congested pattern at the downstream bottleneck can be considered as a wsp in only a finite time interval as long as the synchronized flow of the wsp does not reach the upstream bottleneck .",
    "after the upstream front of synchronized flow of the wsp has reached the upstream bottleneck , an ep appears .",
    "synchronized flow of this ep consists of the synchronized flow of the initial wsp and the synchronized flow at the upstream bottleneck .",
    "the upstream bottleneck may make a great influence on the synchronized flow of the initial wsp , e.g. , this bottleneck can lead to the wide moving jam formation in the synchronized flow .",
    "this occurs in the example of this wsp .",
    "there can be a lot of different types of eps . as it has been shown in  @xcite ,",
    "eps can be explained within the three - phase traffic theory .",
    "this conclusion is linked to the empirical fact  @xcite that congested traffic of all known ep types consists of the traffic phase `` wide moving jam '' and the traffic phase `` synchronized flow '' only .",
    "this result of the empirical study  @xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ expanded ] where an example of an ep is shown  @xcite .",
    "the synchronized flow inside the ep covers at least four bottlenecks ( the locations of the bottlenecks are marked @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ expanded ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ expanded ] ( b ) that congested traffic in the ep consists of the traffic phase `` wide moving jam '' and the traffic phase `` synchronized flow '' .",
    "the empirical results are also confirmed by a microscopic three - phase traffic theory of eps which has recently been developed in  @xcite .",
    "the empirical study made in  @xcite allows us to assume that wsp can occur at off - ramps .",
    "the importance of the wsp analysis is linked to the possibility to show empirical features of synchronized flow of a relatively high vehicle speed .",
    "an example of a wsp which occurs upstream of the off - ramp d25-off on the section of the highway a5-north in germany ( the state `` hessen '' ) is shown in figs .",
    "[ wide1 ] ,  [ wide2 ] ,  [ wide3 ] and  [ wide4 ] . the section of the highway a5-north ( fig .",
    "[ wide1 ] ( a ) ) has already been described in  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "3 ( c ) in this paper ) . a wsp occurs as a result of the f@xmath0s transition upstream of the off - ramp ( also discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ wide1 ] ( b ) and  [ wide2 ] that the vehicle speeds slowly decrease within a wsp in the upstream direction whereas the flow rate does not change considerably when a wsp occurs .",
    "this is a peculiarity of synchronized flow .",
    "when the vehicle speed in a wsp decreases in the upstream direction , some narrow moving jams emerge in this synchronized flow of low vehicle speed ( d17 and d16 , fig .  [ wide2 ] ) .",
    "however , d16 is already at the on - ramp ( d15-on ) . for this reason ,",
    "the synchronized flow propagating upstream , covers this upstream bottleneck at the on - ramp . as a result , an expanded congested pattern ( ep ) occurs  @xcite ( this is not shown in fig .",
    "[ wide2 ] ) .",
    "thus , wsp upstream of the off - ramp at d25-off and downstream of the on - ramp at d16 is only a part of this ep .",
    "nevertheless , the consideration of this wsp allows us to come to some important conclusions about features of the traffic phase `` synchronized flow '' .",
    "in particular , when free flow ( black quadrates in fig .",
    "[ wide3 ] ) and synchronized flow inside wsp ( circles in fig .  [ wide3 ] ) are shown in the flow - density - plane it can be seen , that at least at detectors d20-d18 states of synchronized flow partially overlap with free flow in the density .",
    "the same conclusion can be made if the vehicle speed as a function of the density is drawn ( fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this means that at the same density either a state of synchronized flow or a state of free flow is possible .",
    "if now the average absolute values of the vehicle speed difference between the left lane and the middle lane @xmath5 for free flow ( curve @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( b ) ) and for synchronized flow ( curve @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( b ) ) are shown , then we see that there is overlapping of the speed difference in density .",
    "this overlapping can lead to a hysteresis between the free flow states and the synchronized flow states .",
    "it can be assumed that this overlapping is related to a z - shaped form of the dependence @xmath5 of the density . in the density",
    "should be related to a z - shaped characteristic @xmath8 is made in an analogy to a huge number of physical , chemical and biological systems where states of two different phases overlap in a control system parameter .",
    "naturally , there is usually a hysteresis effect due to this overlapping . in the theory of these spatially distributed systems , dependent of the form of this overlapping it is usually assumed that there is one of the n- , s- or z - shaped characteristics of the system  @xcite .",
    "the middle branch of these characteristics can not usually be observed in experiments .",
    "this is because this branch should be related to unstable states of the system  @xcite .",
    "the assumption under consideration can be considered as correct if the theory predicts features of spatial - temporal patterns which are observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the three - phase traffic theory ( where the z - shaped traffic flow characteristic is used  @xcite ) predicts main features of empirical spatial - temporal congested traffic patterns  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will use the assumption about the z - shaped traffic flow characteristic made above in the further consideration .",
    "] such z - shaped characteristic is in agreement with the hypothesis about the z - shape of the mean probability for passing  @xcite ( see sect .  [ z_fs_sec ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning of the result in fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( b ) is the following : in free flow the difference in the average vehicle speed on german highways between the left ( passing ) highway lane and the middle lane due to the high mean probability of passing is considerably higher than that in synchronized flow .",
    "however , at the same density in a limited range ( e.g. , at d19 from 18 vehicles / km to 26 vehicles / km ) either states of free flow or synchronized flow can exist .",
    "this may lead to a nearly z - form of the dependency @xmath5 on the vehicle density .",
    "the lower the vehicle speed in synchronized flow is the less the density range of the overlapping of the curves @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ wide4](b ) , d18 ) .",
    "this overlapping disappears fully if the vehicle speed in synchronized flow further decreases .      to see the difference between free flow and synchronized flow and features of synchronized flow more clearly , distributions of the number of vehicles as a function of the individual vehicle speed for synchronized flow ( fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( c ) ) and for free flow ( fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( d ) ) are shown .",
    "this is possible because the types of vehicles and their individual vehicle speed during each of the one minute intervals are also available .",
    "firstly , it can be seen that in synchronized flow the mean vehicle speed of vehicles and long vehicles are almost the same for different highway lanes whereas for free flow these mean values are strongly shifted to one another .",
    "secondly , we see that at the detectors d19 during 121 min of the observation individual vehicle speeds in synchronized flow were not lower than 40 km / h ( fig .",
    "[ wide4 ] ( c ) , left ) . at the detectors d18 during 105 min of the observations individual speeds of 6181 vehicles which passed the detectors",

    ", the bottleneck is far away from other effective bottlenecks ) , e.g. , at a bottleneck due to an on - ramp ?",
    "empirical observations in  @xcite and discussed above allow us to conclude that the following scenarios are responsible for the phase transitions and for the pattern evolution in traffic flow at the on - ramp :    1 .",
    "moving jams do _ not _ emerge in an initial free flow at the on - ramp when the flow rate at the on - ramp is gradually increasing . rather than moving jams",
    "the phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow occurs at the on - ramp .",
    "2 .   at a low enough flow rate to the on - ramp",
    "the vehicle speed in synchronized flow which has occurred upstream of the on - ramp is relatively high . moving jams",
    "do _ not _ necessarily emerge in that synchronized flow .",
    "if the flow rate to the on - ramp is high , then the vehicle speed in the synchronized flow is low and moving jams , in particular wide moving jams , emerge in that synchronized flow .",
    "3 .   the lower the average vehicle speed in synchronized flow upstream of the on - ramp , the higher the frequency of the moving jam emergence in that synchronized flow .",
    "this means that the moving jam emergence goes on up to the highest possible values of the flow rate to the on - ramp : traffic states of high density and low vehicle speed , where moving jams do not emerge , are _ not _ observed in synchronized flow upstream of the on - ramp .",
    "the empirical results in item ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are qualitatively in contradiction with both model classes ( i ) and ( ii ) in the fundamental diagram approach . in these models , at high enough initial flow rates on the main road upstream of the on - ramp moving jams must emerge in an initial free flow if the flow rate to the on - ramp beginning from zero is gradually increased  @xcite .",
    "the last empirical result in item 3 means that on average the higher the vehicle density , the lower the stability of traffic flow with respect to the moving jam emergence in that flow .",
    "this result of observations which seems to be intuitively obvious for each driver is in a qualitative contradiction with the models of class ( i ) in the fundamental diagram approach where hct , i.e. , homogeneous congested traffic of high density and low vehicle speed must occur where moving jams do not emerge  @xcite .",
    "the features of the theoretical diagram  @xcite given a high enough initial flow rate on a highway upstream of the on - ramp may be illustrated with the following simple _ theoretical scheme 1 _ :    * a low flow rate to the on - ramp @xmath0 different kinds of moving jams must emerge .",
    "* a high enough flow rate to the on - ramp @xmath0 hct where the density is high and the speed is very low and no moving jams spontaneously emerge must occur .",

    "* a high enough flow rate to the on - ramp @xmath0 moving jams must spontaneously emerge in synchronized flow upstream of the on - ramp at any high flow rate to the on - ramp .",
    "thus , these two schemas ( the theoretical scheme 1  @xcite and the empirical scheme 2  @xcite ) are in contradiction with one another .    it should be noted that in models with the fundamental diagram for steady states which should explain empirical spatial - temporal congested traffic patterns beyond the instability of some of these steady states , fluctuations and instabilities let the system evolve in time through a 2d region in the flow - density plane as well .",
    "this 2d region is related to some `` dynamical '' model solutions .",

    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "these steady states are the same for multi - lane and for one - lane roads . in other words , in the three - phase traffic theory there is _ no _ fundamental diagram for steady states of synchronized flow .",

    "indeed , from empirical observations it may be concluded that at the same distance between vehicles ( at the same density ) there may be a continuum of different vehicle speeds within some finite range in synchronized flow .",
    "obviously the averaging of all these vehicle speeds leads to one average value at the given density .",
    "the 2d region of steady states of synchronized flow ( fig .",

    "this diagram has been postulated on very general grounds within the three - phase traffic theory  @xcite ( see sect .  [ dcp ] ) and demonstrated for a microscopic traffic model by kerner and klenov  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the upper boundary of a 2d - region of steady states of synchronized flow in the flow - density plane is related to the well - known dependence of the safe speed on the gap between vehicles .",
    "the low boundary of these steady states is related to the dependence of a synchronization distance @xmath9 on the speed .",
    "these characteristics of steady states of synchronized flow have been used by kerner , klenov and wolf for the formulation of kkw cellular automata ( ca ) models to the three - phase traffic theory which may show qualitatively the same diagram of congested patterns  @xcite .",
    "recently kerner and klenov developed a miscoscopic non - linear theory of spatial - temporal congested patterns at highway bottlenecks  @xcite .",
    "this theory which is based on the three - phase traffic theory allows us to explain and predict main empirical features of congested traffic patterns  @xcite .",
    "note that the three - phase traffic theory is _ a behavioral theory _ of traffic flow .",
    "this means that the hypotheses of this theory are based on common behavioral fundamental characteristics of drivers observed on highways .",
    "in particular , the fundamental hypothesis of the three - phase traffic theory ( sect .  [ concept ] ) is linked to a driver s ability to recognize whether the distance to the vehicle ahead becomes higher or lower over time  @xcite . if gaps between vehicles are not very high , this driver s ability is true even if the difference between vehicle speeds is negligible .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the main _ qualitative _ features of the congested pattern emergence observed in empirical investigations  @xcite can be shown in the three - phase traffic theory where all drivers have the same characteristics and all vehicles have the same parameters .",
    "obviously , in real traffic there are differences in driver s characteristics and in vehicle parameters ( e.g. , different desired speeds and different safe speeds , aggressive and timid driver s behavior , vehicles and long vehicles ) which may change some spatial - temporal congested pattern parameters and conditions of the pattern emergence .",
    "however , these differences in driver s characteristics and in vehicle parameters may first be neglected when _",
    "fundamental _ congested traffic pattern features are studied .",
    "this statement is confirmed in the microscopic theory of congested traffic patterns  @xcite which is able to explain and to predict main fundamental empirical congested pattern features .      in 1959",
    "herman , montroll , potts and rothery have introduced the concept of a driver s acceleration ( deceleration ) delay time in their car - following microscopic traffic flow model .",
    "they found an instability in some of the steady states of traffic flow  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the delay times in the vehicle acceleration and deceleration has been confirmed in a lot of empirical observations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . to study traffic phenomena beyond the instability , in 1961 gazis , herman and rothery  @xcite and newell  @xcite used the fundamental diagram for steady model states ( for the review see  @xcite ) . later the driver s delay time and the fundamental diagram for steady model states",
    "have been used in a huge number of other traffic flow models and theories where the linear instability of steady states should occurs when the vehicle density exceeds some _ critical _ vehicle density ( see references in the reviews  @xcite ) .    in the three - phase traffic theory ,",
    "the driver s delay time plays a very important role also , however a different hypothesis is suggested  @xcite : _ independent of the vehicle density in a steady state of synchronized flow infinitesimal perturbations of any traffic flow variables ( e.g. , the vehicle speed and/or the gap ) do not grow _ : in the whole possible density range steady states of synchronized flow can exist .",
    "in other words , in the whole possible density range ( fig .  [ diagram ] ) there are no unstable steady states of synchronized flow with respect to infinitesimal perturbations of any traffic flow variables .    to explain this hypothesis from the driver s behavior , let us consider a small enough fluctuation in the braking of a vehicle in an initial synchronized flow steady state which is related to one of the steady states inside a 2d region in the flow - density plane ( dashed region in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "this small braking may lead to a transition from the initial synchronized flow state to another state with a lower gap .",
    "this lower gap is equal to a gap in another state in a 2d region in the flow - density plane .",
    "thus , an occurrence of this fluctuation may cause a spatial - temporal transition to another state of synchronized flow . therefore drivers should not immediately react on this transition .",
    "for this reason even after a time delay , which is due to a finite reaction time of drivers , the drivers upstream should not brake stronger than drivers in front of them to avoid an accident . as a result ,",
    "a local perturbation of traffic variables ( density or vehicle speed ) of small enough amplitude does not grow .",
    "already small amplitude fluctuations make real traffic flow always non - homogeneous and non - stationary .",
    "thus , as well as the theoretical fundamental diagram for steady states it is only a hypothesis which can not empirically be proven ( sect .",
    "[ fd_sunsec ] ) , it is also not possible to prove the fundamental hypothesis of the three - phase traffic theory and the hypothesis about stability of steady states based on a direct empirical measurement of traffic variables . as a proof of the three - phase traffic theory mathematical results of this theory can be considered  @xcite .",
    "these results allow us to overcome the problems of the fundamental diagram approach for the description of empirical features of the phase transitions and spatial - temporal congested patterns .",
    "in contrast to the traffic flow theories in the fundamental diagram approach  @xcite , in the three - phase traffic theory , there is _ no _ critical density where traffic flow should become unstable with respect to the moving jam emergence  @xcite . how is the moving jam emergence explained in the three - phase traffic theory ?    to understand this , we consider first the process of the driver s escaping from a standstill inside a wide moving jam .",
    "this process determines the velocity of the upstream motion of the downstream front of the wide moving jam . in this process",
    ", each driver standing inside the wide moving jam can start to escape from the jam after ( i ) the vehicle in front of the driver has already escaped from the jam and ( ii ) the distance between these vehicles has exceeded some `` safety distance '' .",
    "thus , the driver begins to escape after a delay time in the vehicle acceleration .",
    "the related mean delay time @xmath10 determines the average time interval between two vehicles following one another escaping from the wide moving jam .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the downstream jam front @xmath11 is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mean vehicle density inside the wide moving jam .",
    "we propose that all vehicles are the same and all drivers have the same characteristics .",
    "thus , we can suggest that the mean parameters @xmath13 and @xmath10 do not depend on time .",
    "this means that the velocity of the downstream wide moving jam front @xmath11 ( [ jam_velocity ] ) is also independent of time : the propagation of the downstream wide moving jam front is on average a stationary process .",

    "this hypothesis has been confirmed by numerical simulations of the model by kerner and klenov in the frame of the three - phase traffic theory ( see fig . 1 ( f ) in  @xcite ) .    to explain the hypothesis , note that wide moving jams can not be formed in any steady states of traffic flow situated below the line j. indeed , let the steady state of flow directly upstream of a wide moving jam is related to a point @xmath19 in the flow - density plane which is below the line j ( fig .

    "this has been taken into account in fig .",
    "[ con_fig ] ( b ) : the dashed curve is related to the discharge flow rate from the lsp when the capacity is not reached and the solid curve corresponds to the congested pattern capacity . it can been seen that the congested pattern capacity decreases when the flow rate @xmath94 increases .",

    "the three - phase traffic theory by the author describes phase transitions and a diverse variety of spatial - temporal congested patterns both on homogeneous roads and at highway bottlenecks which are related to results of empirical observations  @xcite .",
    "the features of these phase transitions and of the spatial - temporal congested patterns at bottlenecks in the three - phase traffic theory @xcite are qualitatively different in comparison with the related results which have been derived in the fundamental diagram approach @xcite .",
    "an exception is only the propagation of wide moving jams whose characteristic parameters and features appear to play an important role ( in particular , the flow rate in the outflow from the jam , @xmath15 ) in both the three - phase traffic theory and traffic flow theories in the fundamental diagram approach .",
    "recent empirical results of a study of the congested patterns at on- and off - ramps and of their evolution when the bottleneck strength is gradually changing  @xcite confirm the discussed results and conclusions of the three - phase - traffic - theory @xcite rather than the related results and conclusions of traffic theories in the fundamental diagram approach  @xcite .",
    "the three - phase traffic theory  @xcite has also been confirmed by the on - line application in the traffic center of the state hessen of some recent models `` asda '' ( automatische staudynamikanalyse : automatic tracing of moving traffic jams )  @xcite and `` foto '' ( forecasting of traffic objects )  @xcite which are based on this traffic flow theory .",
    "these models allow reconstruction , tracing and prediction of spatial - temporal traffic dynamics based on local measurements of traffic .",
    "the models asda and foto perform without validation of model parameters at different traffic conditions ( see a recent review about the models asda and foto in  @xcite ) .    a mathematical microscopic traffic flow model in the frame of the three - phase traffic theory which has recently been proposed by kerner and klenov  @xcite shows a considerable potential both for the development of qualitatively new mathematical traffic models and for the traffic flow theory development on the basis of the discussed hypotheses of the three - phase traffic theory .",
    "this is also confirmed by results of a numerical study of several new cellular automata traffic flow models which have recently been developed by kerner , klenov and wolf  @xcite .",
    "based on the three - phase traffic theory , a general probabilistic theory of highway capacity has been developed and presented in this paper .",
    "it is shown that already in free traffic at the on - ramp there may be infinite multitudes of highway capacities which depend on the flow rate to the on - ramp .",
    "when a bottleneck is congested then a much more complicated picture of congested pattern highway capacity can be realized : congested pattern highway capacity strongly depends on the type of the congested pattern and the pattern parameters .",
