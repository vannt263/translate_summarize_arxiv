    "note that the transformation ( [ eq : mtransform ] ) can also be helpful to investigate the dependence of the mfpt on the starting point .",
    "\\(ii ) the numerical integration involves meshing of the domain and quadratures .",

    "although both numerical steps are well documented and controlled , it is instructive to illustrate their accuracy on two simple domains : disk and rectangle .",
    "we first consider the mfpt through the escape arc @xmath173 on the boundary of the unit disk with a linearly varying diffusion coefficient along the radial coordinate : @xmath174 , with a gradient @xmath175 . in the special case @xmath176 ,",
    "one recovers the uniform diffusion coefficient , for which the explicit formula ( [ eq : tdisk ] ) can be used ( see [ sec : disk ] for details ) . for other cases ( @xmath177 ) , we resort to a numerical solution of the original mixed boundary value problem ( [ eq : sfp_omega ] ) by a finite element method ( fem ) implemented in the matlab pde toolbox . our universal formula ( [ eq : stfinal ] ) is compared to a fem numerical solution in fig .

    "in contrast , the numerical implementation of the exact solution ( [ eq : stfinal ] ) is expected to be less sensitive to the escape region size : ( i ) the computation of the conformal map is independent of boundary conditions and of the escape region size , and ( ii ) numerical integration of a smooth integrand function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stfinal ] ) does not require very fine meshes and can be further improved by using high order quadratures . in other words , the numerical advantage of the proposed approach results from the natural `` representation '' of a confining domain by the conformal map and from the incorporation of the mixed boundary condition through the explicit function @xmath41 . moreover",

    "<S> ( [ eq : tfinala ] ) can still be significant ( e.g. , the term @xmath82 ^ 2/d$ ] in this example ) , and ( ii ) this mfpt does not scale with the area of the domain . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , even though the area of the rectangle , @xmath83 , stands in front of the logarithmic term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : tfinala ] ) , the thickness @xmath17 is then removed by the factor @xmath84 coming from @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the last observation challenges another common paradigm that the mfpt is proportional to the area of the domain . </S>",

    "<S> these examples illustrate generic features of the mfpt in porous media with long channels or fjords , and in domains with irregular boundaries , in contrast to earlier works that dealt with very regular domains whose perimeter @xmath1 and linear size @xmath2 were comparable ( see @xcite ) . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic measure of the escape region is proportional to its lebesgue measure ( i.e. , the perimeter ) , recovering the conventional @xmath89 behavior , the proportionality coefficient ( the harmonic measure density ) and the related dependence on the starting point @xmath11 being `` hidden '' in the @xmath76 term . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that even for such regular domains , the dependence on the starting point can be strong and provide the dominant contribution to the mfpt , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mfpt]b , c . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , one can think of two pores connected by a very narrow channel . </S>",
    "<S> if the particle starts inside one pore while the escape region is located on the boundary of the other pore , the mfpt can be made arbitrarily large by controlling the channel width , even if the escape region remains large whereas the condition @xmath90 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> only the average of @xmath23 over the starting point @xmath11 might recover the @xmath91 dependence in the leading term . </S>",
    "<S> however , in many applications , the source of particles and the escape region are well separated ( e.g. , viruses entering the cell at the membrane and searching for the nucleus , or molecules released near the nucleus and searching to escape through the membrane ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed formula ( [ eq : tfinal ] ) thus yields a powerful tool to investigate these search and escape phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> the uncovered relation between the mfpt and the harmonic measure brings new opportunities . on one hand </S>",
    "<S> , one can profit from numerous analytical and numerical results known for the harmonic measure on irregular boundaries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the concept of diffusion screening @xcite that has found numerous implications for heterogeneous catalysis @xcite , fluid flow in rough channels @xcite , and transport phenomena in biological systems @xcite can now be applied to the mfpt . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the harmonic measure of an escape region at the bottom of a fjord can exhibit various types of decay with the `` depth , '' depending on the shape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar dependences are thus expected for the mfpt . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the conformal mapping is a powerful analytical and numerical technique to represent the geometric complexity of a domain through analytic properties of the mapping function @xmath92 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the unit disk can be conformally mapped onto any polygon either by a schwarz - christoffel formula @xcite or by a `` zipper '' algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once the conformal map is constructed , finding the mfpt in complex domains is reduced to computing the integrals in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : tx0_d ] ) or ( [ eq : tfinal ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the proposed approach is not limited to regular domains ( with @xmath90 ) and allows one to study the mfpt for irregular ( e.g. , fractal ) boundaries and branching domains with long rough channels and large surface - to - volume ratios that are relevant for most applications . </S>",
