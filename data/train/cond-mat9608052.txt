    "theories of highly correlated electron systems like kondo alloys @xcite , heavy - fermion systems @xcite and high - t@xmath4 superconductors @xcite mostly start from model hamiltonians like the anderson or hubbard model and its extensions @xcite .",
    "recently a lot of interest has also been taken in the multi - channel version of the kondo model @xcite , to explain non - fermi - liquid behavior observed in non - magnetic 2-level - impurity systems @xcite and certain u - based heavy - fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "common to these models is a single impurity or a lattice of impurities endowed with a local interaction . in hubbard - like models considered here ,",
    "electrons on localized @xmath5- or @xmath1-orbitals experience a coulomb repulsion @xmath0 . for the materials mentioned above @xmath0 is the largest electronic energy , and conventional weak - coupling theories appear not feasible .",
    "besides several mainly numerical techniques , strong - coupling - perturbation theory around the limit of isolated localized orbitals ( atomic limit ) is appropriate for the problem with very large @xmath0 .",
    "the merits of a self - consistent perturbational approach are continuous excitation spectra calculated from green s functions at the real frequency axis , and the possibility to separate quasi - particle formation from residual interactions . on the other hand , ( diagram ) rules",
    "are required which allow for a partial re - summation of the perturbation series to infinite order . in general",
    "this is difficult to achieve in a strong - coupling approach , where the coulomb - interaction operator @xmath6 is part of the unperturbed hamiltonian , whereas the small hybridization between localized orbitals is taken as the perturbation .",
    "the earliest strong - coupling - perturbation approach @xcite deals with time - ordered goldstone diagrams obtained from an expansion of the hamiltonian s resolvent @xcite without wick s theorem and is well established for the anderson - impurity model ( for a review see e.g.  refs . ) .",
    "there is nevertheless enduring interest in alternative approaches , since an extension to e.g.  the anderson - lattice model imposes difficulties on the partial re - summation@xcite , owing to the use of goldstone diagrams , i.e.  the loss of wick s theorem . in slave - boson theories auxiliary ( i.e.  unphysical ) particles are introduced together with a fluctuating field , which represents the constraint @xcite .",
    "conventional many - body technique based on wick s theorem can then be used in the calculation of fluctuation corrections to a saddle point , for impurity and also for lattice models @xcite .",
    "however , one has to start from the mean - field ground state ( reviewed in e.g.  refs . ) , which exhibits broken gauge symmetry @xcite with an admixture of unphysical states which influence sum rules @xcite .",
    "a variety of alternative diagrammatic approaches have been proposed , which start directly from the atomic limit rather than the slave - boson mean - field ground state , like cumulant expansions @xcite , diagram - techniques for hubbard operators @xcite , and slave - particle methods where the mean - field phase is suppressed in keeping the constraint exact in each order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "other attempts seek wick s theorem in the limit of zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a self - consistent skeleton - diagram expansion around the atomic limit of the anderson - impurity model with large @xmath0 , which is built on wick s theorem in its conventional form @xcite .",
