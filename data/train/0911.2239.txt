    "intercalation of foreign atoms in graphite can stabilize superconductivity by introducing metal atoms between the layers , which allow both tuning of the inter - layer spacing and charging of the graphite host .",
    "for a long time it was believed that the maximum critical temperature obtainable at ambient pressure in graphite intercalation compound ( gic ) @xcite was less than 2 k. the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in two intercalated compounds : ybc@xmath0@xcite and cac@xmath0@xcite with unprecedented high transition temperatures , 6.5 k and 11.5 k respectively , has raised renewed interest about the role of phonons in gics .",
    "the role of the in - plane and out - of - plane phonon modes in cac@xmath0 has been controversial . by using the density functional theory ,",
    "it has been shown that superconductivity in cac@xmath0 is due to an electron - phonon mechanism @xcite . the electron - phonon coupling is mainly associated to carbon vibrations perpendicular to the planes of graphite ( c@xmath2 ) , and calcium vibrations parallel to the graphite planes ( ca@xmath3 ) .",
    "however specific heat measurements suggest @xcite that the contribution of c@xmath2 vibrations is even larger than what was predicted by density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "consequently , it would be desirable to measure the phonon dispersion of cac@xmath0 in order to see if there is actually a disagreement between theory and experimental data .    in this work we measure phonons in cac@xmath0 along the @xmath1 axis of the rhombohedral representation using inelastic x - ray and neutron scattering ( ixs and ins respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to asses the precision of dft simulations we compare the calculated and measured in - plane averaged ixs structure factor .    on the longitudinal dispersion along the @xmath1 axis of the rhombohedral representation , we find an unexpected anti - crossing with an unidentified additional mode , at about 11 mev . at the same energy ,",
    "we observe also unexpected intensity on the in - plane direction .",
    "previous measurements of phonon dispersion in cac@xmath0@xcite assign a longitudinal character to a mode in the same energy range , but the mode is transverse . here",
    "we show that and additional mode appear in the same energy region , and interact with the longitudinal acoustic mode . this result could help to resolve this apparently incorrect mode assignment .",

    "first , the longitudinal optical mode is hardened in experiments ( the hardening is 7 mev at zone border ) .",
    "furthermore , although the sound velocity of the longitudinal acoustic mode is in good agreement with dft calculations , above q = 0.1 and about 8 mev , the longitudinal acoustic branch ( la ) suddenly bends , and its energy at the zone boundary is 11.4 @xmath11 0.1 mev , according to ins , which is very close to that of the calculated first transverse optical mode at the zone boundary l ( labeled to in fig.[cdisp ] , top panel ) , at 11.8 mev . the same behavior can be observed on the high energy section of the la mode .",
    "close to the zone boundary , from q = 0.5 to q = 0.3 , the dispersion , as measured with both ins and ixs , reproduces very well the calculated one .",

    "this behavior is reminiscent of an avoided crossing , or anti - crossing , where the longitudinal acoustic mode interacts with an unknown mode . to analyze the experimental data ,",
    "we suppose that the dispersion of the unknown mode is described by :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fitting parameters and ( @xmath23 @xmath23 @xmath23 ) , is the momentum in the rhombohedral coordinates .",
    "we consider a @xmath23-independent coupling @xmath10 with the longitudinal acoustic phonon . within this model ,",

    "we obtain a good fit with @xmath26 mev , @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev , see fig .",
    "[ cdisp ] ( bottom panel ) . as a consequence",
    "the detected anomaly can be explained by the coupling of the longitudinal acoustic phonon mode with a longitudinal excitation or defect mode of unknown origin .",
    "the first optical mode is transverse supposing r@xmath29 m symmetry , and therefore silent in this configuration , as it can be seen in the simulated spectra in fig .",
    "[ compxn ] .",
    "an interpretation of the anticrossing could be that the aforementioned first optical mode would be activated by some symmetry breaking scattering , as from impurities , which would mix different polarizations .",
    "however , the dispersion , flat within error bars , or even with a slight positive slope at zone center , is not compatible with the negative slope of the first optic .    a second possibility , could be the coupling to a longitudinal low energy plasmon .",
    "indeed in another layered material , mgb@xmath30 , an acoustic plasmon mode was indeed detected at surprisingly low energy @xcite . to address this issue",
    "we calculate the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bare susceptibility , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 = 496.38 @xmath35 is the unit cell volume with @xmath36 = @xmath37 = 0.53    is the bohr radius , and @xmath38 is the fermi function for a band energy @xmath39 . since the calculation of eq .",
    "[ eq : chi ] requires a very accurate sampling of the brillouin zone , we calculate the matrix - element using first - principles calculations on a @xmath40 grid and then we interpolate it all over the brillouin zone using wannier interpolation @xcite . in order to obtain a good description of the cac@xmath0 first principles bands , we use 7 wannier functions .",
    "then we interpolate the matrix element and the band structure over a @xmath41 k - points grid and calculate @xmath42 at @xmath43 , close to where the anti - crossing occurs .",
    "the temperature in the fermi function is @xmath44 and the lorentzian smearing @xmath45.the results for the real ( @xmath46 ) and imaginary ( @xmath47 ) part of the susceptibility are shown in fig .",
    "[ chi ] .",
    "a peak in the imaginary part of @xmath48 would signal the occurrence of a plasmon excitation . in our case",
    "the imaginary part of the susceptibility is featureless .",
    "thus no plasmon excitations are present in cac@xmath0 calculated susceptibility . to cross - check our result we also consider the case of mgb@xmath30 where a plasmon was found @xcite . in the mgb@xmath30 case",
    "we reproduce the occurrence of an acoustic plasmon mode in agreement to ref . .",
    "as a consequence the 11 mev excitations is unlikely to be due to a longitudinal plasmon , but most likely to impurities .    a possible origin of the impurity mode would be the presence of lithium in the preparation of the samples by liquid - solid synthesis method @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by a strong xps signal for the lithium ion at the k - edge ( results not shown ) .",
    "however , this measurements are not confirmed by nuclear microprobe analysis .    a further possibility would be the presence of a p6@xmath49/mmc phase in the sample coexisting with the most stable r@xmath29 m one .",
    "however the attempt to describe the c - axis phonon dispersion in terms of a similar p6@xmath49/mmc phase is also unsatisfactory since the dispersion of the low energy modes is hardly distinguishable from the dispersion of the @xmath50 phase . still it is possible that the avoided crossing is generated by the presence of vacancies or other similar defects .",
    "an anomaly at a similar energy is also observed in another set of data which consists in constant - q 2d - phonon density - of - states , with a propagation vector @xmath51 lying in the plane perpendicular to the ( 1 1 1 ) direction and corresponding to the @xmath4 plane . for this ixs experiment ,",
    "the choice of @xmath52 = @xmath16 ( 1,1,1 ) , with @xmath53 0 resulted in a significant contribution from transverse modes . in this respect",
    "what is measured is a 2-dimensional density of states obtained averaging over all the structure factors having modulus of the ixs exchanged momentum @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is in the plane as reported in fig.[q - cut ] and [ abpdos ] .",
    "even if the measurement is not equivalent to a phonon dispersion calculation , as both longitudinal and transverse modes are measured , the low energy modes are fairly well reproduced , except for an extra intensity measured at about 10 to 13 mev for all @xmath17 , in particular for the spectra with q from 0.3 to 0.4 , ( see arrows in fig.[abpdos ] ) in agreement to what we found along the c - axis .",
    "in a recent paper on a comparable sample of cac@xmath0 @xcite , using ixs only , upton and co - workers incorrectly assigned the flat band at @xmath1311 mev to the first transverse optical mode .",
    "this is due to the fact that they lack both a symmetry analysis of their calculated modes as well as the resolution necessary to see the details of the anti - crossing .",
    "note that the region close to zone center , below q = 0.15 , is difficult to measure using ixs due to the large elastic peak at zero energy generated by disorder .",
    "this is not the case in ins scattering data and only by using this experimental technique the avoided crossing behavior between the la mode and an unknown mode can be revealed .",
    "we note that for the first time , using the in - plane configuration with ixs , we found good agreement between the data and the simulation in the 50 mev energy region .",
    "this is particularly important as vibrations propagating in - plane in this energy window are supposed to be among the ones contributing to electron - phonon mechanism @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we show that low energy phonon structure of the superconducting graphite intercalated compound cac@xmath0 , show clear anomalies , in disagreement with dft calculations assuming the perfect crystal structure . in particular we observe an anti - crossing of the acoustic longitudinal mode with an additional longitudinal flat mode .",
    "calculation of the electron susceptibility suggests that this mode can not be attribute to a plasmon excitation .",
    "thus we infer that the unknown excitation is most likely due to defects , impurities or vacancies . on the other hand , we found good overall agreement between the data and the simulations , particularly in the 50 mev energy region where the c@xmath2 vibrations propagating in - plane in this energy window are supposed to provide the largest contribution to electron - phonon mechanism .",
