    "the extrasolar planet hd209458b is the first one for which repeated transits across the stellar disk have been observed ( @xmath21.5%   absorption ; henry et al .  2000 ;",
    "charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ) . together with radial velocity measurements ( mazeh et al .",
    "2000 ) , this has led to a determination of the planet s radius and mass , confirming that it is a gas giant . during transits , the hubble space telescope ( hst ) allowed the detection of the dense lower atmosphere in the neutral sodium lines ( @xmath20.02%  additional absorption , charbonneau et al .",
    "2002 ) and the extended upper atmosphere in hi ( @xmath215% absorption over the stellar lyman  @xmath1  emission line , vidal - madjar et al .",
    "this hi  absorption extends beyond the roche lobe , showing a population of escaping atoms .",
    "the escape rate is estimated to be @xmath3gs@xmath4 , consistent with theoretical evaluations ( hbrard et al .",
    "2003 , lammer et al .",
    "2003 , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "the additional hst observations which we present here allow the upper atmosphere of hd209458b to be further studied .",
    "four transits of hd209458b were surveyed with the stis g140l spectrograph with four hst visits on oct .  9 ,",
    "oct .  21 , nov .  5 and nov .  24 , 2003 .",
    "for each transit , three exposures during three consecutive hst orbits were scheduled such that at least one full exposure was obtained with the planet in front of the star . a previous or a following exposure , either entirely before the first contact or after the last contact , serves as a  reference .",
    "the resulting 1d and 2d spectra , output from the stis pipeline , are similar to those described by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "in particular they show detectable geocoronal emissions in hi  and oi  lines and a non - zero background level due to the dark current . to correct for these effects , we extracted the spectra from the 2d images of the detector following the procedure developed by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and dsert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in each column of the detector",
    "we evaluate the background signal , including the geocorona , above and below the stellar spectrum and interpolate its value to be subtracted from the stellar spectrum .",
    "the errors due to the background and the geocorona are included in the error estimates .",
    "the wavelength domain of the g140l first order grating ranges from 1180  to 1710 .",
    "the spectra are dominated by various stellar emission lines ( siiii @xmath51206 , hi  @xmath51216 , nv  @xmath51239  and @xmath51243 , oi  @xmath51302 , cii  @xmath51335 , siiv @xmath51394  and @xmath51403 , si  @xmath51474 , siii  @xmath51527 , civ @xmath51548  and @xmath51551 , ci @xmath51560  and @xmath51657 ) and the stellar continuum is detected down to the shortest wavelength ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the low resolution ( @xmath22.5 ) does not allow the stellar emission lines to be resolved .",
    "the spectral information is consequently limited to the total line intensity variations .",
    "however , this allows for high sensitivity and large spectral coverage to search for many different species in the planetary upper atmosphere .",
    "to visualize the spectral signature of the transit , we over - plotted off - transit and in - transit spectra ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "a significant difference is seen in hi , oi  and cii , corresponding to an absorption during the transit .",
    "other spectral lines with about the same intensity do not show the same behaviour ( e.g. , siiii in fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is the first indication that , in addition to hi , oxygen and carbon are also present in the upper atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "to quantitavely estimate the absorptions , their level of detection and error bars , we fitted transit profiles to the measured intensity of each line in each exposure as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "the depth and width of the transit curve are related to @xmath6/@xmath7 , the ratio of the occulting object and stellar radii .",
    "the absorption depth due to the planetary disk is @xmath8/@xmath9 . the duration of the ingress and egress of the occultation ( i.e. the width of the transit curve ) is taken to be proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the term @xmath6/@xmath7 is the first free parameter of the fit .",
    "the intensity of the emission lines shows detectable variations from one hst visit to another .",
    "these variations are interpreted as stellar variations , known to occur in a solar type star at a few percent level on a time scale of several  days .",
    "to extract the transit signature from these intrinsic variations , we consider the lines intensity as a free parameter for each of the 4 visits .",
    "we have thus 4 additional free parameters for each spectral line .",
    "the intrinsic stellar variations are found to be at a level of only a few percent between different  visits .",
    "the stellar emissions during 3 consecutive exposures of  a given hst visit are assumed to be constant .",
    "we consider unlikely that short time - scale variations could mimic a transit curve in hi , oi  and cii  and not in the other lines , particularly those of the more ionized species for which more pronounced stellar variations should be observed .",
    "we measured the total line intensities after subtraction of the stellar continuum .",
    "the resulting 12  measurements have been fitted as a function of the orbital phase by an occultation curve with five  free parameters .",
    "results are shown in fig .  3 and summarized in table  1 .",
    "the full continuum spectrum from 1350  to 1700  shows a transit detection with a depth of 2.0@xmath10% . in lines ,",
    "only hi , oi and cii show a detection at more than 2-@xmath11 with transit depths of 5@xmath02% in hi , 13@xmath04.5% in oi and 7.5@xmath03.5% in cii ( 2.6 , 2.6 and 2.1-@xmath11 detection , respectively ) .",
    "the total squared difference between the line intensities and the fits are found to have values of 8.9 , 9.6 and 4.7 ( for hi , oi  and cii , respectively ) , in agreement with a @xmath12 distribution with 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "the other stellar features do not show detectable signatures during transit .",
    "a 10% depth corresponds to a radius @xmath6 of about 3.6  jupiter radii , which is also the radius of the roche lobe .",
    "the measured absorption depths in oi  and cii  correspond to absorbing clouds with a size of several planetary radii .",
    "the present detections show that oxygen and carbon are present in the extended upper atmosphere ; oi  is even present up to about the level of the roche lobe .",
    "the detection of an absorption of 2.0@xmath10% over the continuum validates the adopted procedure .",
    "this absorption is due to the transit of the planetary disk and is known to be @xmath21.5% , well within our error bar .",
    "this shows that the systematic errors are significantly below this level .",
    "vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) detected an hi  absorption depth of 15@xmath04% over the lyman-@xmath1 line .",
    "the absorption is significantly detected over only part of the lyman-@xmath1 line within a radial velocity range from @xmath13 to @xmath14kms@xmath4(fig .  2 of vidal - madjar et al .",
    "the 15@xmath04% absorption in that spectral range corresponds to about 5.7@xmath01.5% absorption of the total lyman-@xmath1 line intensity .",
    "the hi  absorption depth measured here is consistent with the results of vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the oi  stellar emission triplet is a blend of the ground level line at 1302.2  with the lines from excited levels oi * and oi * * ( @xmath5=1304.9 , energy level @xmath15=158cm@xmath4 and @xmath5=1306.0 , @xmath15=227cm@xmath4 , respectively ) .",
    "the oi   ground level line is strongly absorbed by the interstellar medium ( fig .",
    "therefore the @xmath213% absorption observed during the transit in the full oi  triplet must be due to the presence of oi * and oi * * within several planetary radii around the planet , up to about the radius of the roche lobe . because these excited levels of oi  are likely populated by collisions , the hi  density at this altitude should be at least the density of a typical exobase , that is about 10@xmath17@xmath18 . assuming solar abundances , such a density is needed for the oi  triplet to have enough opacity to be detected in a line of sight grazing the planet . in these conditions ,",
    "only the strongest lines of the most abundant species in the most abundant ionization state can be detected , i.e. hi , oi  and cii  ( ci is ionized above  11.3ev ) .",
    "seen at low resolution , the stellar cii  line is also a blend of a ground level line from cii ( @xmath5=1334.5 ) with a line from cii * ( @xmath5=1335.7 , @xmath15=63.42cm@xmath4 ) . since",
    "the ground level cii line is only partially absorbed by the interstellar medium ( fig .",
    "2 ) , at the present low spectral resolution , we can not a priori discriminate between absorption by cii  or cii*. however , for densities above @xmath19@xmath18 ( wood & linsky 1997 ) , cii * is expected to be collisionally populated , we thus conclude that the detected absorption is due to the presence of both cii  and cii * in the extended upper atmosphere of hd209458b .    due to the lack of spectral resolution",
    ", the real absorption depth over a wavelength limited domain of an emission line ( which is linked to the size of the occulting cloud ) can be different from the measured absorption depth over the full stellar emission intensity ( sect .  [ hydrogen ] ) .",
    "the measured decrease in intensity depends on the velocity dispersion of the absorbing species compared to the intrinsic width of the stellar emission lines .",
    "hd209458 being a solar type star , we can use the sun as observed by the sumer instrument as a reference ; the width of the oi  and cii  stellar lines must be about @xmath215kms@xmath4 for oi  and @xmath225kms@xmath4 for cii  ( chae et al .",
    "1998 ; p. lemaire , private communication ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the high resolution echelle spectra of hd209458 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "therefore , in the absorbing cloud , velocity dispersions of , for example , 25 , 15 and 3kms@xmath4 lead to corrected absorption depths of 13@xmath20% , 13@xmath20% and 65@xmath21% for oi  and 7.5@xmath22% , 12.5@xmath23% and 62.5@xmath24% for cii , respectively . note that we obtain similar absorption depths for oi  and cii   for velocity dispersions below @xmath215kms@xmath4 .",
    "as shown by vidal - madjar et al ( 2003 ) , hydrogen atoms are escaping away from hd209458b .",
    "this has been further discussed by hbrard et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , lammer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , liang et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2004 ) , lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and yelle ( 2004 ) .",
    "the present detection of oxygen and carbon at high altitudes provides additional information about the type of escape mechanism involved .",
    "first , oxygen is present up to about the roche lobe where the hi  density must be at least 10@xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "second , the absorption depths of oxygen and carbon are related to their velocity dispersion , with @xmath213%depth for 15kms@xmath4 velocity dispersion and @xmath265%  depth for 3kms@xmath4 .      in the frame of jeans",
    "escape , atoms and molecules diffuse upward from the base of the thermosphere up to the exobase level above which the absence of collision allows particles with large velocities in the tail of the maxwellian distribution to escape . in the thermosphere ,",
    "the scale height of hi  is of the order of 10000  km ( 0.1  planetary radius ) . under molecular diffusion conditions",
    ", the oi  scale height is 16  times smaller than the hi  one . for an altitude increase of one hi  scale height ,",
    "the o / h ratio decreases by a factor e@xmath25e .",
    "therefore , if molecular diffusion dominates no oi can be detected at high altitudes .",
    "however , in the solar system planetary atmospheres , eddy diffusion is able to transport upward species within the thermosphere up to some level where molecular diffusion takes over .",
    "this transport mixes the species , and their abundances remain unchanged upward .",
    "assuming an extreme case of eddy transport up to the roche lobe or to the exobase , oxygen and carbon abundances should be solar at that level . however even with eddy diffusion and upper atmospheric temperature @xmath2610000k ( lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "2004 ) , thermal broadening of absorption lines are @xmath213kms@xmath4 for hi , and only @xmath23kms@xmath4 for oi   and cii .",
    "this is smaller by a factor of @xmath275 than the width of the stellar lines .",
    "if the absorption width was limited by the thermal broadening , the observed @xmath210% absorption would correspond to a geometrical absorption of more 60% .",
    "this would imply that oxygen and carbon extend much further than hi , which is unlikely .",
    "eddy diffusion transport can not explain the properties of the absorption in oi  and  cii .",
    "to explain the present observation , we need a mechanism able to transport oxygen and carbon up to about the roche lobe and to maintain their velocity dispersion to at least @xmath210kms@xmath4 .",
    "when an abundant species like hi  escapes with a high rate , other species can be dragged up by the hydrodynamical flow , also called `` blow - off '' ( see , e.g. , chamberlain & hunten 1987 ) . under such conditions , oxygen and carbon moving out with the hi  flow should present a velocity dispersion at least similar to or greater than the sound speed , which is @xmath210kms@xmath4 at 10000k , i.e. transsonic ( parkinson et al .",
    "the abundances of oxygen and carbon should also be preserved upward all along the flow . under these conditions ,",
    "the amounts of oi  and cii  are large enough to absorb the whole stellar line , allowing at least 10%  absorption if they flow up to the roche lobe .",
    "although the oi  and cii  absorptions are compatible within the error bars , the dynamical `` blow - off '' could also explain the apparent lower absorption in carbon as the cii  stellar emission line is broader than the hi  sound speed by a factor of @xmath22 . in short , the depth of the oi  and cii  absorptions can be interpreted through the absorption by oxygen and carbon flowing away in a hydrodynamic escape of the atmospheric hydrogen .",
    "the still unique case of the planet hd209458b transiting a bright star has allowed the first studies of an extra - solar planet atmosphere . the detection of oxygen ( at  2.6@xmath11 ) and carbon ( at 2.1@xmath11 ) , a signature of an atmospheric `` blow - off '' , shows that , as already suggested by hbrard et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and vidal - madjar & lecavelier des etangs ( 2003 ) hot - jupiters can lose a significant fraction of their atmosphere .",
    "ultimately , such a process could lead to a new type of planets with hydrogen  poor atmosphere , or even with no atmosphere at all ( see trilling et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
