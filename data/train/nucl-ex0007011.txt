    "the double radiative decay of pionic atoms @xmath10 was investigated theoretically by ericson and wilkin  @xcite a quarter of a century ago .",
    "they predicted that the dominating reaction mechanism was the annihilation of the stopped , real @xmath11 with a soft , virtual @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 .",
    "as they advertised , the annihilation mechanism affords a selective coupling to soft pions , and special sensitivity to renormalization effects in nuclear matter .    in order to understand the @xmath13 decay mode of a pionic atom ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the elementary process of @xmath14 .",
    "several authors have made tree ",
    "level calculations of the @xmath15 capture mode of pionic hydrogen .",
    "the most recent published calculations are due to beder  @xcite , who obtained 5.1@xmath1610@xmath17 for the @xmath15 branching ratio .",
    "beder also pointed out the importance of the pion annihilation diagram , especially at small photon opening angles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rmc_theory]a ) .    the first attempt to observe the two photon emission in hydrogen pion capture",
    "was made by vasilevsky  et.al.@xcite at jinr dubna .",

    "the predicted dominance of the @xmath7 annihilation amplitude in @xmath14 allows to study pion compton scattering  @xcite . the feynman diagram in fig.[fig : rmc_theory]b can be viewed as the annihilation of a real pion with a virtual pion @xmath19 or , via crossing symmetry , as the transition of a real pion to a virtual pion via compton scattering @xmath20 ( fig.[fig : rmc_theory]c ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : rmc_pionpol ]    the extracted pion polarizabilities have large uncertainties and are ( except mark ii ) substantially larger than the @xmath21 prediction @xcite , @xmath22 , which is based on a robust relationship between radiative pion decay @xmath23 and pion compton scattering @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath24 .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment obviously calls for more experimental attention .",
    "recently gerasimov@xcite , pointed out , that the double radiative decay of the pionic deuterium ( @xmath26 ) can be used as a means to investigate the existence of the @xmath27 dibaryon ( @xmath28 kev ) that was claimed by the dib-2gamma collaboration@xcite .",
    "as pointed out by gerasimov the @xmath27 does indeed exist , one should be able to detect it via the following chain :    @xmath29    based on a toy model , gerasimov estimated that the resonant decay of pionic deuterium via @xmath27 should occur roughly 100 times more frequently than non - resonant decay of @xmath30 .",
    "additionally , a clear signature of the hypothetical @xmath9 would be the photon spectrum with two lines : one at @xmath31 mev ( @xmath32 ) and the other at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the experiments presented here were performed at triumf laboratory using the rmc pair spectrometer  @xcite on the m9a beam line .",
    "the pionic hydrogen data ( e838 ) were taken in december 1998 and april - may 1999 and the pionic deuterium data ( e864 ) were taken in april 2000 .",
    "an 82 mev / c pion beam was stopped in a liquid hydrogen ( deuterium ) target ( approximate dimensions : length 15 cm , @xmath3616 cm ) , the photons were converted into @xmath37 pairs in a 1 mm thick pb cylinder .",
    "the @xmath38 trajectories were then measured in a set of cylindrical wire and drift chambers , and the magnetic field provided momentum analysis .",
    "trigger scintillators hit patterns were used to identify events .",
    "we collected approximately 1000 @xmath14 events and 500 @xmath26 events .",
    "a cut on the @xmath13 opening angle was used to remove @xmath39 events and a cut on the beam / trigger scintillators was used to remove accidental @xmath13 events .",
