    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario predicts the existence of cuspy dark halos , and thus is expected to produce significant numbers of wide separation lenses ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "statistics of such wide separation lenses are known to be a powerful tool to probe the abundance @xcite and the density profile of dark halos @xcite .",
    "although a number of radio surveys has tried , they could not find wide separation lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of wide separation lenses , however , does not conflict with the cdm scenario because the expected lensing rate is significantly smaller than that of small separation lensing ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that they found six quasar pairs which may be lensed multiple images in the 2df quasar ( qso ) catalog comprising 22163 quasars , although the number of lensed quasars may be even larger than this because they have done follow - up for only 11 quasar pairs among 38 quasars selected as possible lens candidates .",
    "these systems were identified to be lensed images from the detailed comparison of quasar spectra .",
    "the separations of all these quasar pairs are larger than @xmath10 , and the separations of some pairs reach even @xmath11 .",
    "if this surprising result is true , it offers a lot of information about dark halos . in this _",
    "letter _ , we calculate the expected number of arcminute - separation lenses ( @xmath12 ) in the 2df qso survey .",
    "we use the realistic density profile predicted in the cdm scenario , and take account of the redshift and magnitude distribution of the quasar catalog .",
    "therefore our results can be directly compared with the observation .",
    "we show that the existence of such wide separation lenses in the 2df qso catalog is marginally consistent with the `` concordance '' cosmology if the value of only @xmath1 is very large , @xmath13 for @xmath5 .",
    "this means that we can strongly constrain dark halo properties if some of quasar pairs reported by @xcite are truly gravitational lens systems . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a flat universe @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the lensing probability distribution at wide separation reflects the properties of dark halos , rather than galaxies @xcite .",
    "the halo density profiles predicted by recent n - body simulations may be parameterized as a one - parameter family , the generalized nfw profile @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a critical density at @xmath18 .",
    "while the correct value of @xmath19 is still unclear , the existence of a cusp with @xmath20 has been established in recent n - body simulations @xcite . for definiteness ,",
    "in this paper we consider two cases , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which cover the range of the cdm predictions .",
    "the scale radius @xmath23 is related to the concentration parameter @xmath24 .",
    "then the characteristic density @xmath25 is given in terms of the concentration parameter ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lens equation of the generalized nfw profile has three solutions if @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the position of a source in the source plane and @xmath28 is a radius of the radial caustic in the source plane .",
    "the image separation is defined between the outer two solutions and is approximated as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a radius of the tangential critical curve in the lens plane , @xmath31 denotes the angular diameter distance from the observer to the lens plane , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 indicate the redshifts of the source and lens , respectively .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath34 is one of the most important parameter in the generalized nfw density profile ( eq . [ [ nfw ] ] ) . in numerical simulations",
    ", it has been found that the concentration parameter depends on the mass @xmath35 and redshift @xmath18 of halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , it shows considerable scatter which reflects the difference in the formation epoch @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the concentration parameter is well described by a log - normal distribution . for the median of concentration parameter @xmath36",
    ", we adopt the mass and redshift dependence reported by @xcite : @xmath37 note that this fitting form is slightly different from the one @xcite originally proposed , and is correct at @xmath38 . a factor @xmath39 in equation ( [ conmed ] )",
    "gives a natural way to generalize @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the scatter of the concentration parameter @xmath41 is also important element in gravitational lens statistics @xcite .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath42 which has been obtained from n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the probability that a source at redshift @xmath32 and having the absolute luminosity @xmath43 is observed as multiply lensed system with separation larger than @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnification bias @xcite : @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the luminosity function of sources .",
    "the lensing cross section @xmath49 is simply given by the area encompassed by the radial caustic , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 indicates the angular diameter distance from the observer to the source plane . the lower limit of mass integral @xmath52 is related to @xmath44 as @xmath53 . the magnification bias ( eq . [ [ biasfactor ] ] ) should be calculated for the faintest of the two images , because both lensed images must appear above the flux limit of the 2qz survey @xcite .",
    "we use an approximation of the magnification factor @xmath54 which was derived by @xcite .    since wide separation lenses with @xmath12 are considered to be generated by massive clusters , we should choose the mass function of dark halos ( @xmath55 in eq .",
    "[ [ cpd_bias ] ] ) carefully .",
    "we adopt equation ( b3 ) of @xcite which well agrees with simulated high - mass halo abundance @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath56 should be used as the mean overdensity when one adopts this mass function .",
    "to make a precise prediction which can be directly compared with observed lensing rate , we must properly take account of the redshift and magnitude distributions . since the whole sample used to search lensed quasars",
    "is not publicly available , we instead use the 2df 10k catalog comprising @xmath57 quasars @xcite which is a part of the whole sample . then predicted numbers of wide separation lensing",
    "are calculated as follows .",
    "first , from the catalog we extract the numbers of quasars @xmath58 which are located @xmath59 and have magnitude @xmath60 .",
    "we use @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the average probability that quasars are lensed with separations larger than @xmath44 is then given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the @xmath46-band absolute luminosity corresponds to @xmath65 . when the quasar continuum spectrum is described by a power law , @xmath66 , the k - correction can be approximated as @xmath67 .",
    "we assume @xmath68 to calculate the k - correction .",
    "the total number of lensed quasars expected in the 2df qso survey is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total number of quasars in the whole sample .",
    "the luminosity function of quasars is needed to compute magnification bias .",
    "we adopt the double power law luminosity function : @xmath71^{\\beta_h}+[l / l_*(z)]^{\\beta_l}}\\frac{dl}{l_*(z)}.\\ ] ] we assume pure luminosity evolution models with @xmath72 , and use a best - fitting model which was derived by @xcite in the @xmath73 universe : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "= 8.1 cm    first we plot the predicted number distribution of image separation in the 2df qso survey in figure [ fig : sep ] .",
    "the cases that the density profile of lens objects is described by the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) are also shown for reference .",
    "the value of @xmath1 has been constrained from x - ray clusters or cosmic shear , but resultant values show discrepancies among papers , ranging from @xmath79 to @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we plot both @xmath82 and @xmath83 models .",
    "figure [ fig : sep ] clearly indicates that the predicted numbers of lenses strongly depend on both density profile ( @xmath19 ) and the abundance ( @xmath1 ) of dark halos . in particular , numbers of arcminute - separation lensed quasars are highly sensitive to @xmath1 because such very wide separation lenses are mainly produced by massive clusters .",
    "we find that expected numbers of lensed quasars with image separation larger than @xmath84 is quite small , @xmath85 , while 4 quasar pairs which are likely to be lensed were found @xcite .",
    "we further find that even an `` extreme '' model with @xmath22 and @xmath86 can produce only @xmath87 lenses with @xmath88 on average .",
    "on the other hand , less wide separation lenses ( @xmath89 ) may be statistically possible if both @xmath19 and @xmath1 are large .",
    "= 8.1 cm    to see what constraint can be put from the detection of wide separation lenses , in figure [ fig : os ] we plot contours of @xmath90 in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "we also plot constraints from the observed number of lenses assuming that some of six pairs reported by @xcite are true lens systems .",
    "these constraints are calculated from the poisson distribution @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the observed number and @xmath93 is the expectation .",
    "given the numbers of true lenses range from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , the lower limits of @xmath93 ( 95% confidence level ) become @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "this figure indicates that the detection of even one lens with @xmath12 in the 2df qso catalog needs very high @xmath1 , @xmath102 for @xmath5 and @xmath22 .",
    "our constraint and constraints from x - ray clusters or cosmic shear which are approximated as @xmath103 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows marginal agreement if @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath22 , although this solution seems too extreme .",
    "in particular , models with @xmath106 are hardly acceptable because they need unusually high @xmath1 or @xmath0 in order to produce lenses with @xmath12 .",
    "however , this result is somewhat embarrassing because the lack of wide separation lensing in other surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) already puts the upper limit of the lensing rate .",
    "for instance , our model with @xmath22 , @xmath5 , and @xmath107 predicts a lensing rate @xmath108 at @xmath109 which is marginally consistent with the upper limit of the lensing rate in @xcite , @xmath110 at 95% confidence limit .",
    "note that these constraints are for the case that only one of six quasar pairs is a genuine lens system ; if the number of lenses is more than one , the situation becomes worse . in this case , the discrepancy between strong lensing constraints and x - ray / shear constraints becomes more serious .",
    "moreover , this result may conflict with other surveys which could not detect wide separation lenses .",
    ".theoretical uncertainties in the expected numbers of lensed quasars .",
    "the fiducial model has @xmath22 and @xmath111 .",
    "`` press & schechter mf '' and `` sheth & tormen mf '' models are same as the fiducial model except for using the mass function derived by @xcite and @xcite instead of that fitted by @xcite , respectively . in `` croom et al .",
    "lf '' model , we use the quasar luminosity function from the 10k catalog @xcite . note that this luminosity function has fairly shallower bright- and faint - end slopes , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "[ table : unc ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also examine possible theoretical uncertainties except for the uncertainties of the density profile and cosmological parameters . more specifically ,",
    "we examine the uncertainties of the halo mass function and the quasar luminosity function .",
    "the result is summarized in table [ table : unc ] .",
    "first we adopt the mass functions of @xcite and @xcite and see how the number of lensed quasars changes .",
    "we find that the uncertainty of the mass function is fairly large .",
    "in particular , the mass function of @xcite predicts more than three times as large number of lenses with @xmath12 as our fiducial model . this is because the mass function of @xcite seems to overestimate the number density of massive halos @xcite .",
    "moreover , we point out that the number of anomalously wide separation lenses ( @xmath88 ) is much more sensitive to the choice of the mass function . therefore , in the statistics of such anomalously wide separation lenses the uncertainty of the mass function should be carefully examined .    since the magnification bias is sensitive to the slope of adopted quasar luminosity function",
    ", next we examine the uncertainty of the quasar luminosity function using the luminosity function from the 10k catalog @xcite .",
    "this luminosity function has somewhat shallower slopes , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , compared with our fiducial model .",
    "we find that this uncertainty is less than factor 2 and is not so large as to change our main results , because @xmath19 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 can change the number of wide separation lenses by orders of magnitude .",
    "= 8.1 cm    the main drawback of wide separation lensing statistics is that it is hard to recognize quasar pairs as gravitational lens systems due to large time delays between images ; any spectrum change within the timescale of differential time delays may prevent one from selecting such systems as lens candidates .",
    "we show conditional probability distributions of time delays proposed by @xcite in figure [ fig : tdelay ] .",
    "we find that the dependence of time delays on the density profile is weak when the separation is large , although this tendency was already shown by @xcite .",
    "they also concluded that time delay probability distribution is insensitive to cosmological parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : tdelay ] suggests that lenses with even smaller separations , @xmath89 , are likely to have time delays larger than ten years which may be typical time scale forming the broad absorption line @xcite .",
    "therefore , to assert quasar pairs as lensed images , one must compare spectral signature which would be unchanged within possible time delays . needed",
    "time scales are @xmath114 for @xmath89 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "we note that the information of flux ratio and the central core image may become one of the evidence of gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the predicted numbers of arcminute - separation ( @xmath12 ) lensed quasars in the 2df qso survey .",
    "we have presented realistic predictions based on the cdm scenario taking account of the redshift and magnitude distributions of the quasar catalog .",
    "detailed comparison between theoretical and observed numbers of lensed quasars indicates that the detection of wide separation lenses puts interesting constraints on the density profile and abundance of dark halos .",
    "the case that only one of six pairs is genuine lens system is marginally consistent with the model that has cuspy inner density profile @xmath3 and the large value of @xmath1 , @xmath102 for @xmath5 . to reconcile this result with x - ray or shear measurement , much smaller @xmath0 ( @xmath117 ) and much larger @xmath1 ( @xmath105 ) are needed .",
    "our result of this large @xmath1 is similar to that of the sunyaev - zeldovich angular power spectrum , @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "we have found also that it is quite hard to produce lenses with separation @xmath7 .",
    "thus a conservative interpretation of this observation is that none of these quasar pairs is lensed .",
    "but if it turns out that some of these quasar pairs are genuine lens systems , we can put interesting constraints on not only the density profile of dark halos but also the @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are somewhat different from x - ray / shear constraints .",
    "we note that the number of genuine lens systems may be significantly larger than six which @xcite reported because only 11 of 38 candidates has been observed spectroscopically",
    ". however , such anomalously high lensing rate can not be reproduced by even the most optimistic models . in this case",
    ", we have to examine whether we miss some important systematic effects which increase lensing rates .",
    "one possible systematic effect is the asymmetry of lensing halos , although this effect has been considered to be small so far . in any case ,",
    "statistics of wide separation lensing offer a promising way to probe the abundance and density profile of dark halos .",
