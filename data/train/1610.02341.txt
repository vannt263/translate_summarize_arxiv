    "neutral hydrogen plays an important role in the fuelling pipeline for star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "the study of hi can therefore provide insights into some of the main physical processes that drive galaxy evolution . to this end",
    ", numerous surveys ( see giovanelli & haynes 2015 for a recent review ) have been conducted with the aim of determining the hi mass ( ) of large numbers of galaxies , such as the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs , rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) , the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass , barnes et al .",
    "2001 ) and the hi jodrell all - sky survey ( hijass , lang et al .",
    "most recently , the arecibo legacy fast arecibo l - band feed array ( alfalfa ) survey has provided a wide area , moderate depth ( log /m@xmath48.5 ) , blind survey of hi in the local ( @xmath5 ) universe ( giovanelli et al .",
    "2005 ) . due to the broad inverse correlation between gas fraction and stellar mass ,",
    "relatively few massive galaxies are included in the alfalfa detections . to complement the strategy of alfalfa , the galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass )",
    "has therefore performed deep 21  cm observations of @xmath3 1000 massive ( log m@xmath2/m@xmath6 ) galaxies down to a fixed gas fraction limit ( catinella et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ) .",
    "coupled with multi - wavelength data from other large surveys , these large hi surveys have provided unprecedented insight into the connections between global gas properties and environment , nuclear activity , star formation and chemical enrichment ( cortese et al .",
    "2011 ; fabello et al . 2011 ; bothwell et al . 2013 ; lara - lopez et al . 2013 ; hughes et al .",
    "2013 ) .    despite the tremendous efforts of hi surveys",
    ", the measurement of hi masses continues to lag behind optical surveys .",
    "for example , in contrast to the @xmath3 5000 detections available for the 40 per cent alfalfa data release ( haynes et al . 2011 ) , the main galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) contains more than two orders of magnitude more galaxies out to @xmath7 ( e.g. strauss et al .",
    "for this reason , there is a long history of efforts that attempt to infer  from more readily available optical properties ( roberts 1969 ; bothun 1984 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ) . in the last decade ,",
    "such efforts have been able to capitalize on large , homogeneous datasets , often in combination with multi - wavelength data in the uv and ir regimes ( kannappan 2004 ; zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; catinella et al 2010 , 2012 ; toribio et al . 2011 ; wang et al . 2011 ; li et al .",
    "2012 ; denes , kilborn , & koribalski 2014 ; eckert et al .",
    "these works have used different linear combinations of physical parameters to reduce scatter between the estimated and observed hi gas mass fraction ( defined as  throughout this paper ) . however , despite the availability of extensive physical parameters , and the identification of the ` best ' parameters for  estimation , the improvement in the accuracy of scaling laws has been small . for example , zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used a linear combination of @xmath1-band surface brightness and @xmath0 colour that was motivated by the kennicutt - schmidt law to achieve a scatter in their  estimator of @xmath3 0.31 dex .",
    "catinella et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that the near ultraviolet ( nuv ) nuv@xmath8 colour was the single best estimator of hi mass , and determined a ` gas fraction plane ' by combining the stellar mass surface density ( @xmath9 ) , nuv@xmath8 and hi gas mass fraction .",
    "however , the scatter in this relation remained at 0.3 dex ( see also catinella et al .",
    "motivated by the finding that gas fractions are linked to outer disk colours ( wang et al .",
    "2011 ) , li et al .",
    "( 2012 ) add the colour gradient to their linear estimator , applied to alfalfa and gass samples , but again the scatter in the hi gas fraction was not improved beyond @xmath10 dex . moreover , many of these linear scaling relationships still have significant systematics relative to stellar mass , age , colour or concentration indices ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2009 ) .    despite their current limitations , linear scaling relations and the gas fraction plane are useful as indicators of ` hi normalcy ' , which can be used to identify outliers ( within a given sample ) that are either particularly gas - rich or gas - poor ( e.g. catinella et al .",
    ". similarly , cortese et al .",
    "( 2011 ) demonstrate that the distance from the gas fraction plane is a good alternative to the classic ` hi deficiency ' parameter ( haynes & giovanelli 1984 ) .",
    "however , extreme caution must be applied in using scaling relations to _ estimate _ , due to the inherently biased nature of the samples from which they are ( currently ) constructed .",
    "for example , the application of scaling relations derived from the blind , but shallow , alfalfa data tends to over - estimate  in deeper , or targeted surveys ( e.g. , huang et al . 2012 ) .",
    "problems may persist even when precautions are taken to identify galaxies with broadly similar properties as the calibration sample .",
    "for example , zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) identify a sample of star - forming galaxies from which they determine their scaling relation .",
    "it might therefore be expected that the distinction between star - forming and quiescent galaxies may help to identify samples of galaxies appropriate for the application of the zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) parametrization .",
    "however , huang et al . (",
    "2012 ) show that the zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) relation is not a good predictor of  in alfalfa , despite the domination of star - forming galaxies in the latter .",
    "therefore , whilst linear scalings reveal the typical relationship between  and other optical / nuv / infrared ( ir ) properties _ for a given sample _ , they can not be used as a universal predictor of hi gas mass fraction , particularly in circumstances when galaxies are expected to deviate from the ` normal ' relation ( e.g. cortese et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the application of non - linear methods , such as artificial neural networks ( anns ) , to the challenge of gas fraction estimation .",
    "we have previously demonstrated the application of ann to various astronomical problems , including pattern recognition for the spectral classification of galaxies ( teimoorinia 2012 ) , fitting applications in order to estimate line fluxes which can be used for active galactic nucleus ( agn ) classifications , metal abundances etc .",
    "( teimoorinia & ellison 2014 ) and a large public catalog of estimated ir luminosities ( ellison et al .",
    "2016a ) that can be used to determined star formation rates for galaxies dominated by agn ( ellison et al .",
    "most recently , we have presented a method for ranking the parameters involved in galaxy quenching , which effectively disentangles the complex multi - variate nature of this physical process ( teimoorinia et al . 2016 ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to those works for details of the general ann method .",
    "the non - linear ann techniques used in these previous works are readily applied to the estimation of the gas fraction from large input datasets . in this work , we will train and validate the ann using galaxies drawn from the alfalfa.70 data release , matched to galaxies in the sdss dr7 . the trained network can then be applied to all galaxies in the dr7 ( not covered by alfalfa.70 ) in order to predict the gas fraction based on their optical properties .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec - sample ]",
    "we describe the samples that are used for training the ann and the method used for rejecting galaxies that may have their 21  cm fluxes contaminated by the presence of a close companion within the arecibo beam .",
    "the results in the following sections are then presented with respect to three main objectives .",
    "first , we will explore whether non - linear methods are able to reduce the scatter in  scaling relations below what has been previously achieved for linear calibrations for a given set of input parameters ( section [ sec - example ] ) .",
    "specifically , we use the same optical input parameters as zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in order to compare the scatter of their linear calibration with that of the non - linear methods .",
    "although this example uses a limited number of variables for training , it serves as a direct comparison of the performance of linear and non - linear techniques . in section [ sec - example ]",
    "we demonstrate how differences in hi surveys can influence the application of scaling relations . in section [ sec - performance ]",
    "the input data for the ann are described and also a performance function , r , is introduced for ranking the weights of input parameters in the fitting procedure .",
    "a second performance metric is then used to determined which galaxy variables show the most important physical connection with .",
    "the third objective is then to develop the non - linear relationships between  and galactic properties into a procedure that can be robustly used to estimate  for galaxies in the sdss , the results of which are presented in section [ sec - fitting ] . in section [ sec - pr ]",
    "we describe a pattern recognition procedure that determines how similar a given galaxy is to those that have been used in the training set ( i.e. detections in alfalfa ) .",
    "we hence are able to assign an alfalfa detection probability , , to any sdss galaxy ; a robust gas fraction can be best determined for galaxies with high detection probabilities ( i.e. the galaxy is similar to the alfalfa detected galaxies on which the ann was trained ) .",
    "the final strategy for defining a robust sample for applying the ann is presented in section [ sec - comb ] . in section [ sec - sum ]",
    "a short summary is presented . a public catalog of the hi gas mass fraction , the control parameters and errors accompanies this paper in electronic format .",
    "at the heart of our ann approach is a training set based on matches between the sdss dr7 galaxy catalog and the alfalfa.70 data release which contains 6837 galaxies with 21  cm detections at a s / n@xmath11 6.5 .",
    "following haynes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we allocate a code = 1 to these objects ( hereafter ac1 ) .",
    "haynes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also identify lower s / n detections ( code = 2 , hereafter , ac2 ) . although ac2 galaxies have been matched to galaxies in the sdss and are therefore likely detections , we take the conservative measure of not including them as detections in our training sample .",
    "our analysis also makes use of galaxies not detected by alfalfa .",
    "non - detections of sdss galaxies are not explicitly reported in the alfalfa data releases , so we make use of the non - detections for the alfalfa.40 footprint as computed by ellison et al .",
    "the 23,652 non - detections are allocated a code = 3 ( ac3 ) . )",
    "it should be noted that the training sample is sufficiently low redshift ( and also validation sets which are discussed in this paper ) that it is safe to assume no evolution with redshift in the quantities of interest .",
    "while each of the galaxies in ac1 consists of an hi source with a single optical counterpart , the relatively large diameter of the arecibo beam ( 3.3@xmath123.8 arcminutes ) means that more than one galaxy may contribute to the 21 cm flux of a given source ( haynes et al .",
    "2011 ; jones et al . 2015 ) , leading to overestimates of the hi fluxes of some galaxies .",
    "we therefore undertake a three - step process to remove from our ac1 sample galaxies whose hi flux may be contaminated by neighbouring galaxies within the beam .",
    "first , for every galaxy in our initial training set , we search for all known spectroscopic companions ( from simard et al .",
    "2011 ) which may contribute significant additional flux to a given galaxy s hi measurement . given the paucity of gas in red sequence galaxies , we consider only companions which are blue .",
    "following patton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we classify galaxies as blue if they have simard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) global rest - frame colours of @xmath13 .",
    "if a galaxy has one or more blue companions which lie within one beam radius ( 1.9 arcminutes ) and within a relative velocity of 250 km s@xmath14 , we conclude that there is a risk of significant hi contamination , and remove the galaxy from our training set .",
    "a total of 431 galaxies were removed from our training set for this reason .",
    "second , we remove galaxies which lie within one beam radius and 250 km s@xmath14 of a known alfalfa source .",
    "while approximately half of these sources have already been removed in the previous step , a comparable number remain due to spectroscopic incompleteness in sdss . in particular , fibre collisions lead to a high rate of spectroscopic incompleteness at angular separations less than 55 arcsec ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 , patton & atfield 2008 ) .",
    "a total of 27 additional galaxies are removed from our training set for this reason .",
    "finally , we address the possibility of contamination by companions whose centres lie outside the alfalfa beam and yet whose hi flux is likely to overlap the beam .",
    "we use alfalfa hi gas fractions and the mendel et al .",
    "( 2014 ) stellar masses to compute the hi mass of all companions which lie outside the beam but within 250 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we then estimate the hi radius of each companion , using the relationship between hi mass and diameter reported in wang et al .",
    "( 2016 ) if a companion s estimated hi radius overlaps the beam , we remove the given host galaxy from our training set .",
    "an additional 50 galaxies are removed from our training set by this criterion , leaving a training set of 6329 galaxies whose hi fluxes are unlikely to be contaminated by neighbouring galaxies .",
    "visual inspection of the sdss images of a random subset of these galaxies confirms this interpretation , as no obvious blue galaxies are seen within one beam radius ( with the exception of those with relative velocities greater than 250 km s@xmath14 ) .      in order to test our  estimator on independent datasets",
    ", we will also make use of several other samples that have been matched with the sdss .",
    "the largest of these is the gass sample , for which we use the 342 detections from the data release 3 ( catinella et al .",
    "additionally , we use the cornell catalog ( @xmath15 galaxies , giovanelli et al 2007 ) as incorporated into the gass representative sample and a sample of @xmath16 post - mergers ( pm ) presented by ellison et al .",
    "( 2015).we have also used 279 galaxies ( of 2839 , matched with our ann s input parameter space ) from the nancay interstellar baryons legacy extragalactic survey ( nibles ) sample , presented by van driel et al .",

    "galaxies in the nibles sample are at the bright end of the sdss distribution .",
    "all of the above samples have large amounts of ancillary information available , which may be used as input variables for the  estimation , from the following sources :    * photometry is taken from sdss dr7 .",
    "structural parameters , such as bulge fractions and galaxy sizes are taken from the re - processed sdss images by simard et al .",

    "another important result from this section is the potential pitfalls associated with combining different datasets for training .",
    "homogeneity is key in the training process .",
    "if the training sample is heterogeneous ( either in its intrinsic properties or in the methods used to obtain measured or derived properties ) the network will be compromised .",
    "moreover , the mixed quality or depth of a combined dataset ( e.g. alfalfa+gass ) makes it very challenging to determine a unique set of control and quality parameters , which is a critical part of our analysis .",
    "it is therefore extremely rare that different datasets are ( or can be ) combined for training .",
    "instead , we use a single sample for our training set ( alfalfa ) and then define the regime for which it can be robustly applied to other samples .",
    "this might be done in linear examples using a simple criterion such as a cut on a physical parameter .",
    "since the parameters can be correlated with each other in different and complex ways , if we want to use a higher dimensional space as a training set then some simple cuts on only some input data might not be a suitable approach . in section [ sec - pr ]",
    "we will return to this point and describe a pattern recognition method using an ann model to achieve this objective .",
    "an important pre - analysis step is the selection of the input parameters on which the ann will be trained .",
    "galaxy evolution involves a complex interplay between many parameters and the manual exploration of parameter space normally restricts investigation to a handful of variables at a time .",
    "however , with an ann approach , the parameter space can be expanded straightforwardly to enable a multi - variate analysis .      in selecting the parameters used for our training set , we have attempted to incorporate the primary physical variables that may affect the hi gas fraction .",
    "some of the parameters are not independent ; for example , we use both g- and r - band magnitudes as well as g - r colour .",
    "this repetition is not detrimental to the network s performance , but contributes stability .",
    "photometry and galaxy colour represent some of the raw observables that have been shown to correlate with gas fraction ( e.g. kannappan 2004 ; denes et al .",
    "2014 ; eckert et al .",
    "these are in turn related to physical parameters such as galactic stellar mass , which has been shown to exhibit a strong anti - correlation with  ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; catinella et al .",
    "2010 ; huang et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , internal galaxy structure , size and the distribution of stellar mass appear to be even more tightly correlated with gas fraction than stellar mass itself ( zhang et al . 2009 ; catinella et al .",
    "2010 ; toribio et al .",
    "2011 ; wang et al .",
    "2016 ) . furthermore ,",
    "brown et al . (",
    "2015 ) have argued that specific star formation rate also modulates  at fixed m@xmath2 .",
    "environment also appears to play a role in determining gas fraction with gas fractions suppressed in both the cluster ( e.g. chung et al .",
    "2007 ; cortese et al . 2011 ; denes et al . 2014 ) and group ( e.g. verdes - montenegro et al . 2001 ; rasmussen et al . 2008 ; kilborn et al . 2009 ; catinella et al . 2013 ; hess & wilcots 2013 ; denes et al . 2016",
    "; odekon et al .",
    "2016 ) environments . we have included two environmental metrics in our list of training variables , halo mass and @xmath52 , although brown et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have recently shown that it is the former of these that dominates the environmental dependence of .",
    "the full list of 15 parameters used in our work , based on the sdss imaging and spectroscopic data , is presented in table [ tab1 ] , which includes photometry , metrics of internal size and structure , star formation and environment .",
    "we note that not all the 15 parameters are available for all galaxies .",
    "this requirement reduces the number of galaxies in both the gass and nibles samples from their complete data release . in the analysis that follows , the full ac1 and ac3 samples",
    "are therefore sometimes restricted further by the lack of input parameter data . if a certain input variable ( such as a magnitude in a band ) is required for a given training run , galaxies without a robust measurement of that input variable are excluded . amongst the parameters in table [ tab1 ] ,",
    "there are two notable omissions of parameters that may significantly dictate .",
    "the first is angular momentum , which has recently be proposed by obreschkow et al .",
    "( 2016 ) to dictate hi gas fractions based on arguments of gas instability in the interstellar medium ( see also huang et al .",
    "2012 ; maddox et al . 2015 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have metrics of angular momentum available for our sample .",
    "we have also not included a nuv colour , proposed by several works ( e.g. cortese et al .",
    "2011 ; catinella et al .",
    "2013 , brown et al .",
    "2015 ) to be the single most important variable in their samples .",
    "requiring nuv photometry reduces our sample size by a factor of more than 4 , to only @xmath3 1400 galaxies , which was found to be inadequate for ann training .    .galaxy",
    "variables used in training sets . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table - samp ]",
    "in this paper we have presented a novel method to estimate hi gas mass fraction and the associated uncertainties based on the patterns found in our data sets , using machine learning methods .",
    "the alfalfa survey is used as our main training sample , and we check our model estimations with a range of validation sets , comprised of the gass and cornell surveys and a small sample of post - merger galaxies . we have shown that , for a given set of input parameters , non - linear methods can significantly reduce the scatter in the estimation of , compared with traditional linear fits . specifically , we demonstrate that using only the @xmath0 colour and @xmath1-band surface brightness , a matrix - based model can reduce the scatter in a linear model from 0.32 dex to 0.22 dex .    in order to extend our models to include more galactic parameters",
    ", we assess the correlations between  and 15 parameters derived from the sdss imaging and spectroscopic datasets .",
    "two performance parameters are presented : r , which represents the relative weights of the fit in minimizing scatter and auc , which quantifies the physical relevance of a given galaxy parameter to its gas fraction .",
    "the auc ranking shows that @xmath0 colour and stellar mass surface density both strongly govern a galaxy s gas fraction , with specific sfr and b / t having a further marginal relevance .",
    "we introduce several parameters that permit the assessment of how accurately is estimated for a given galaxy in the sdss .",
    "the scatter in the estimation of is determined from 20 individually trained networks ( ) and provides an indication of variation in the fitting process .",
    "the inverse normalized version of  ( ) has a value from 0 to 1 , where higher values indicate a smaller scatter .",
    "we also use a pattern recognition technique to identify the similarity of a given galaxy to the alfalfa detections used in our ann training set , . again",
    ", this parameter has a value between 0 and 1 , where higher values indicate a greater similarity to alfalfa detections , and hence , a higher likelihood that the network can provide an appropriate estimation of .  and",
    "can by multiplied together to yield a single parameter , , whose value again ranges from 0 to 1 , where higher values indicate more robust estimations .  can also be used to determine an uncertainty associated with a given  estimation .",
    "we demonstrate how the application of these various parameters to the validation sets effectively removes outliers from the ann estimations .",
    "a  cut of 0.5 yields @xmath3 150 000 galaxies with  estimations from our ann approach , a factor of @xmath3 20 greater than the number of firm 21  cm detections in the 70 per cent data release of alfalfa .",
    "all of the quality control parameters accompany the  estimations in the online table .",
    "our catalog of predicted gas fractions offer several advantages over previous attempts to calibrate gas fractions .",
    "for example , we have shown that there is no systematic error in our  estimates with various galaxy properties , and the scatter in our estimates is lower than has been previously achieved . perhaps most importantly ,",
    "we have provided a quantitative prescription for assessing the robustness of our estimates , on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "our ann  estimates also potentially offer advantages over even direct arecibo observations .",
    "the large size of the arecibo beam ( 3.3@xmath123.8 arcminutes ) is not able to distinguish contributions from multiple galaxies with close separations . indeed , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - fit - ac1 ] and [ fig - fit - ac1-unclean ] , whilst our predictions reproduce well the gas fractions in the ` clean ' training sample , galaxies with close companions have observed gas fractions that are typically 0.14 dex above the ann predictions .",
    "finally , our ann - based gas fractions extend the number of galaxies in the nearby universe with robust  estimates by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the growth in sample size yields predictions for large numbers of galaxies in parameter space beyond current samples .",
    "for example , most hi surveys are currently limited to @xmath53 , whereas our  predictions extend to @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , our catalog contains @xmath3 61,000 robust (  @xmath11 0.5 )  predictions at @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig-25 ] shows the distribution of gas fractions for the gass , highz ( catinella & cortese 2015 ) and alfalfa.70 samples ( green , red and grey points respectively ) , compared with the ann predictions ( blue contours and points , where the latter show individual galaxies with counts below the lowest contour ) .",
    "it can be seen that the ann predicts a significant population of high stellar mass ( log m@xmath55 ) galaxies with gas fractions log  @xmath56 .",
    "such galaxies are largely absent from current samples and are predicted to contain some of the highest hi masses in the local universe .",
    "follow - up observations of these high stellar mass , high hi mass galaxies to confirm our ann predictions would be of great interest .",
    "we are grateful to barbara catinella and luca cortese for comments on an earlier draft of this paper and for help and advice with the alfalfa.70 sample .",
