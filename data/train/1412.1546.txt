    "evidence has also been reported by gravitational microlensing for objects having approximately the mass of jupiter distributed throughout the galaxy ( sumi et al .",
    "a surprisingly large number of these objects were inferred , nearly two for every star in the galaxy .",
    "however , the evidence was based on the statistical properties of a large sample of microlensing events .",
    "measurements of the masses of individual pmos were not attempted .",
    "most recently , luhman ( 2014 ) reported evidence for a nearby ( @xmath52pc ) y type brown dwarf with temperature @xmath5250k , mass 3 - 10@xmath6 and age 1 - 10gyr .",
    "the search by luhman was aimed specifically at nearby brown dwarfs , and the result suggests a high spatial density of them , comparable to that reported by sumi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for isolated pmos with masses @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible that the object found by luhman represents the high mass tail of the distribution found by sumi et al .",
    "further observations of nearby objects may therefore help to identify the objects found by sumi et al .",
    "the above results , in particular those by microlensing , raise a number of questions . did these objects form in - situ , and could they therefore be better classified as sub - brown - dwarfs ( gahm et al .",
    "2013 ) ? or could they be planets orbiting stars at larger radii than gravitational microlensing is sensitive to ( quanz et al .",
    "2012 ) ? were they planets that formed around stars , and subsequently underwent ejection through planet - planet or planet - star interactions ( guillochon et al .",
    "2011 , malmberg et al .",
    "2011 , veras & raymond 2012 , kaib et al .",
    "2013 ) ? is the high number of putative objects of jupiter mass accompanied by a larger population of terrestrial mass objects ? or does the high number of apparent detections imply some degree of bias in the statistical procedure used , or contamination by variable stars in the sample masquerading as gravitational microlensing events with low - mass lenses ?    in this paper we report a re - analysis of moa-2011-blg-274 , a microlensing event in which the lens was reported by choi et al .",

    "choi et al .  reported analyses of several microlensing events where the lens geometrically transited the source , i.e. where @xmath21 or , equivalently , @xmath22 .",
    "they referred to these well - aligned events as ones in which the lens ` passed over ' the source star . in such events it is possible to measure the angular einstein radius @xmath11 of the event ( gould 1994 , alcock et al .",
    "choi et al .  found @xmath11 @xmath5 0.08 mas for moa-2011-blg-274 , which is unusually small in comparison to typical microlensing events .",
    "they also reported that the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath9 , for the event was unusually small , @xmath5 2.7 days . as the einstein radius for gravitational lensing is proportional to the square root of the mass of the lens , choi et al",
    "concluded that the lens of the event , i.e. moa-2011-blg-274l , could have been a pmo .",
    "here we extend the analysis of choi et al .  in a number of ways .",
    "the photometry for two of the datasets was improved by re - reductions .",
    "secondly , instrument - specific limb - darkening coefficients of the source star were computed and used in the analysis .",
    "thirdly , an investigation into the possibility of recovering the lens mass and distance through measurement of terrestrial parallax was made following a prediction of gould ( 1997 ) .",
    "fourthly , an independent search for satellites orbiting the putative pmo was carried out and the results compared to those of choi et al .",
    "fifthly , a search was made for a star in the vicinity of moa-2011-blg-274l that it might be orbiting .",
    "finally , we discuss future observational strategies that could yield definitive measurements of the masses of individual pmos and also uncover pmos of lower mass than those reported by sumi et al .",

    "they observed moa-2011-blg-274 intensively over a three hour period when the magnification rose from @xmath5 40 to a peak value of @xmath5 200 and then fell again to @xmath5 40 .",
    "the peak occurred over australasia and microfun monitored this period with a 0.4 m telescope at the auckland observatory equipped with a custom red filter , a 0.36 m telescope at kumeu ( in the auckland region ) equipped with a similar red filter , a 0.36 m unfiltered telescope at the farm cove observatory in auckland , and a 0.3 m unfiltered telescope at the pest observatory in perth .",
    "unfortunately , conditions were cloudy at mt john during the peak of the event , although the sky was clear immediately prior to and immediately following the peak when the magnification was @xmath26 .",
    "data were recorded with the 1.8 m moa telescope and the custom moa red filter at these times , and also on previous and subsequent nights .",
    "in addition , data were obtained at magnifications @xmath2710 and lower in the i - band by the ogle and ctio 1.3 m telescopes in chile .",
    "the larger datasets are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .    to reduce computer runtime",
    ", the moa data were binned into single night segments in the wings of the event .",
    "also , to minimise the effects of possible drifts in the moa data , all data taken prior to 2010 were excluded .",
    "the data were generally reduced by the groups that supplied them . thus the moa and ogle data were reduced using the codes of bond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and udalski ( 2003 ) .",
    "these codes utilise the difference imaging procedure of alard and lupton  ( 1998 ) , and wozniak  ( 2000 ) . in the case of the moa data",
    "the online reduction was replaced by an off - line reduction to optimise the precision through improved astrometry .",
    "the microfun data were reduced by the dophot code of schechter et al .",
    "( 1993 ) with the exception of the pest data for which the latter reduction appeared relatively noisy .",
    "these data were therefore re - reduced using the more accurate difference imaging pysis code of albrow et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    the uncertainties in the data from the auckland observatory , pest and moa telescopes were renormalised to force their contributions to @xmath28 to be approximately equal to the numbers of data points .",
    "for the moa data this involved adding uncertainties in quadrature and scaling them . the data from the other telescopes were already reasonably well normalised .",
    "a total of 1276 data points were used in the final analysis with 683 by moa , 335 by ogle , 113 by auckland , 35 by farm cove , 77 by kumeu , and 33 by pest .",
    "it is customary to identify the source star in a gravitational microlensing event of high magnification from its de - reddened colour @xmath29 and its de - reddened apparent magnitude @xmath30 .",
    "these are normally determined by recording a few images of the event at high magnification in the v passband .",
    "these are combined with contemporaneous or near - contemporaneous images in the i passband to yield an instrumental and reddened @xmath31 colour and an instrumental and reddened apparent magnitude @xmath32 of the source star .",
    "these are then converted to non - instrumental and dereddened values @xmath29 and @xmath30 by using the position of the red clump on the colour magnitude diagram as a standard .",
    "no v band images of moa-2011-blg-274 were taken at high magnification . a modified version by gould et al .  ( 2010 ) of the above procedure was therefore used .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of the source star were obtained from single lens fits to the light curves recorded by the unfiltered pest telescope , @xmath33 , and the ogle telescope , @xmath34 . from these an instrumental colour @xmath33 - @xmath34 = 2.13 @xmath35 0.04 was deduced .",
    "using field stars , two linear colour - colour relationships were found : one for @xmath36-@xmath37 vs @xmath38-@xmath37 and one for @xmath39-@xmath37 vs @xmath38-@xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath37 denote instrumental magnitudes recorded by the ctio telescope in the v and i passbands .",
    "these two relationships were subtracted to yield a linear relationship between @xmath36-@xmath39 and @xmath38-@xmath37 .",
    "insertion of the instrumental colour @xmath33 - @xmath34 into this relationship yielded the instrumental colour of the source star seen by the ctio telescope @xmath40 = 0.0 @xmath35 0.08 .",
    "finally , this was converted to a dereddened and non - instrumental colour @xmath29 by reference to the position of the red clump on a colour magnitude diagram seen by the ctio telescope in the normal manner .",
    "this procedure also yielded the de - reddened and non - instrumental magnitude of the source star @xmath30 .",
    "the final results were    @xmath41    @xmath42    the angular radius @xmath43 of the source star was determined from the above results and the surface brightness relationship of kervella ( 2008 ) .",
    "this yielded @xmath44    choi et al",
    ".  followed similar procedures to those described above in their analysis of moa-2011-blg-274 and obtained results within @xmath45 of those above .",
    "the distance to the source star was determined under the assumption that it lay in the galactic bar . adopting the model of cao et al .",

    "recently bensby et al .  (",
    "2011 ) used a sample of high - magnification microlensing events to spectroscopically determine the distribution of ages and metalicities of main sequence stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "a roughly bimodal distribution was found containing approximately equal mixtures of older metal - poor stars with ages 8 - 12 gy and metalicities [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -0.6 , and younger metal - rich stars with ages 4 - 12 gy and metalicities [ fe / h ] @xmath51 + 0.3 .",
    "a subsequent investigation with a larger sample of stars indicated additional stars with intermediate metalicities ( bensby et al .",

    "the above values of source star radius @xmath54 and absolute magnitude @xmath52 for moa-2011-blg-274 then enable the source star to be identified as most likely an old , metal - rich , turn - off star of @xmath5 1.1 solar mass , as shown on figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] . these plots should be applicable to most microlensing events .    an effective temperature for the source star of @xmath55k was estimated from its colour ( bessell et al , 1998 ) . in comparison ,",

    "i.e.  @xmath59 , we would have @xmath60 in the absence of limb darkening ( liebes , 1964 ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath61 . as seen from figure  [ fig3 ]",
    ", the effect of limb darkening is to effectively reduce the radius of the source slightly , and hence to increase @xmath62 slightly .",
    "the angular einstein radius is given by the relationship @xmath63 and is included in table  [ table2 ] . as found by choi et al .",
    "it is considerably smaller than in typical microlensing events .",
    "as shown in table  [ table2 ] , the measured value of the einstein radius crossing time @xmath9 = 3.26d is also anomalously small .",
    "typically @xmath64d ( sumi et al .  2011 , paczynski 1996 ) and @xmath65mas for a one - third - solar mass lens half way to the bulge .",
    "the above measurements independently suggest a small value for the mass of moa-2011-blg-274l , as the einstein radius is proportional to the square root of the mass of the lens . but a small mass is not assured , as the above measurements do not fix the distance to the lens , @xmath14 , and the lens - mass depends on this as well .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath14 is the subject of the following sections .",
    "the importance of measuring the lens distance @xmath14 may be seen if we examine the range of values that @xmath66 takes if , as a worst case scenario , we eschew any knowledge of @xmath14 . in that case",
    "we may use einstein s equation for the mass of a lens as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath14 as follows    @xmath68    this is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath14 with values @xmath69 at @xmath14 = 2 kpc , @xmath70 at @xmath14 = 4 kpc and @xmath71 at @xmath14 = 6 kpc for @xmath72 mas .",
    "thus , if moa-2011-blg-274l is in the disc it is a pmo , and if it is in the bulge it is a brown dwarf .",
    "this highlights the need to determine the lens distance . in principle , this can be achieved by the microlensing parallax method .",
    "the observed magnification in any microlensing event at any time depends on the angular separation between the lens and the source . at small separations and high magnifications we have @xmath73 .",
    "the magnification therefore varies slightly from point to point on the earth s surface at any given time .",
    "also , the time of peak magnification varies from point to point ( hardy & walker 1995 , gould et al .",
    "these effects are known as terrestrial parallax , and they depend on the distance to the lens .",
    "the closer the lens , the larger the effects .",
    "both effects are undetectable unless the magnification varies unusually rapidly with time .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig1 ] reveals rapid variation of the light curve of moa-2011-blg-274 , and also good coverage of the light curve from different locations .",
    "it therefore appears ideal for investigation of the measurability of terrestrial parallax . in a previous detection of terrestrial parallax",

    "2009 ) , @xmath74 was 2,500 and @xmath56 was 7 days .    the related effect of orbital parallax , in which the earth s non - rectilinear motion about the sun is taken into account , can also be used to determine the distance to the lens in microlensing events ( gould 1992 , alcock et al .",
    "orbital parallax is normally detectable in events with relatively long einstein times , but @xmath9 was anomalously short in moa-2011-blg-274 .",
    "we may therefore anticipate that , if parallax is detectable in moa-2011-blg-274 , it will have been caused predominantly by terrestrial parallax .",
    "the effects of parallax ( both terrestrial and orbital ) may be quantified by the two - dimensional vector @xmath75 with east and north components @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively ( gould 2004 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the parallax vector @xmath78 is defined to be @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the radius of the einstein ring projected back to the observer s plane , and its direction is defined to be the direction of motion of the lens projected onto the observer s plane .",

    "they were determined from the light curves for each telescope shown in figure  [ fig6 ] and they are listed in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "they are clearly consistent with an event travelling northwards .",
    "the projected distance between mt john and the auckland observatories along the above trajectory at @xmath105 west of north is 690 km , so at a speed of 39 km / s we anticipate an 18 second difference between the observed peak magnifications , in agreement with the times in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "the peak magnification observed at farm cove was higher than that observed at perth in the model with @xmath106 , indicating that the track lay to the east of australasia in this model .",
    "a similar conclusion follows from the peak magnifications observed at auckland and mt john .",

    "the analysis in  5 includes all the available information on parallax in moa-2011-blg-247 in compact form .",
    "however , it is perhaps not as transparent as possible .",
    "for example , it does not isolate the terrestrial component of parallax from the orbital component . also , it is difficult to see with the naked eye any improvement of the light curve with parallax ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) over that without ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .    in the present event we expect orbital parallax to be undetectably small as the event occurred at the end of june when the earth s orbit is nearly perpendicular to the line of sight to the galactic bulge , and because the einstein crossing time was short .",
    "we therefore expect terrestrial parallax to dominate .",
    "the clearest manifestation of the latter is the different times of peak magnification it causes for telescopes at different locations on the earth s surface .",
    "an analysis that focuses on these times may therefore be helpful .    with this in mind , the data for each telescope were individually fitted to single - lens , finite - source , linearly limb - darkened , non - parallax light curves for a sequence of values of @xmath107 . in this procedure @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath9",
    "were allowed to vary .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "these plots enable the effect of parallax to be seen by the naked eye .",
    "they were used to extract the peak times recorded by each telescope together with their uncertainties , as given in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "l c c pest & @xmath108 & @xmath109 + kumeu & @xmath110 & @xmath111 + auckland & @xmath112 & @xmath113 + farm cove & @xmath114 & @xmath115 + moa & @xmath116 & @xmath117 +    comparison of the entries in tables  [ table4 ] and  [ table5 ] shows that the times recorded by the individual observatories agree closely with those determined by the combined analysis in  5 of all data from all observatories with the exception of the time recorded by the farm cove observatory where there is a @xmath118 discrepancy .",
    "we assume this occurred as a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the above highlights the accuracy of the timing needed to carry out a successful measurement of terrestrial parallax in events like moa-2011-blg-274 .",
    "the required accuracy is of order a few seconds for the peak of the light curve for each telescope .",
    "this is undoubtedly demanding , but we note that the analysis is expected to be relatively immune to small uncertainties in limb darkening , sky transmittance and ccd spectral response of each telescope , and also to small uncertainties in the best values of @xmath83 , @xmath58 , and @xmath9 used in the fitting procedure .",
    "this follows because only the axis of symmetry of each light curve was extracted from the data , and small errors in the above quantities should not affect this appreciably , especially as each telescope observed the ascending and descending branches of the light curve almost symmetrically .",
    "suppose , as discussed in  5 , the lens for the event was actually a brown dwarf at a distance @xmath119 kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] then predicts a velocity of the lens in the observer plane @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "whilst such a velocity may be possible with high velocity stars in the bulge , it would imply timing differences between the various telescopes in table  [ table5 ] @xmath122s which appears unlikely .",
    "checks were made of the sampling procedure used to determine the light curve .",
    "the most important data were obtained in a four hour time span when the light curve was sampled in 300 sec exposures ( auckland , fco , kumeu ) , 240 sec exposures ( pest ) , 100 sec exposures ( ogle ) or 60 sec exposures ( moa ) .",
    "the luminosity changed appreciably during these exposures , but it was implicitly assumed that the average magnification during an exposure equalled the magnification at the mid - exposure time .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] , which is based on the best fit to the data , quantifies this effect .",
    "the upper panel shows the difference between the average and mid - exposure magnifications by telescope , and the lower panel shows the difference between the average photon arrival time and the mid - exposure time .",
    "both plots highlight the points of inflexion on the lightcurve where the effects are greatest .",
    "if the portion of the light curve immediately before and after a point of inflexion is non - uniformly monitored by a telescope , then an apparent displacement @xmath123 sec could result in the measured peak time .",
    "we expect this is approximately the magnitude of this effect in the present event , and suggest it could be advisable in future events to limit exposures to 200 seconds .",
    "the preceding discussion indicates that the lens in moa-2011-blg-274l may be an isolated pmo or a sub brown dwarf . in principle , it may also be a planet orbiting a host star at such a large distance that the host did not affect the microlensing light curve appreciably .    to test this possibility simulations",
    "were conducted with a star of mass 300 times the mass of the planet , i.e.  approximately one - third solar mass or the most likely value , located at various distances out to 1000 einstein radii from the planet , i.e.  out to approximately 70 au from the planet .    our simulations , and those in the following section , were conducted using the magnification map procedure described in abe et al ( 2013 ) and the on - line reduction of the images from the moa telescope .",
    "the planet was placed at the origin in the lens plane , and its possible host star with a star : planet mass ratio of @xmath124 was placed on the @xmath125-axis at @xmath126 .",
    "both @xmath124 and @xmath126 were assumed to be large in the sense that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "thus the host star was assumed to be much heavier than the planet , and its separation from the planet was assumed to be much larger than the einstein radius of the planet .    under these conditions ,",
    "the point of maximum magnification in the source plane is no longer directly behind the lens .",
    "it is shifted by a factor of @xmath129 einstein radii towards the larger second body ( dominik 1999 ) .",
    "also , it becomes an astroid shaped four - fold caustic , which is transited by the source in the best fit .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows a typical magnification map , a four - fold caustic , when the host star is detectable ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) .",
    "the horizontal and vertical diameters of the caustic are similar to the diameter of the source star , and the effect of the caustic on the light curve is detectable . for host stars at greater distances with @xmath132 the size of the caustic diminishes and it fits completely inside the source star .",
    "its effect on the light curve is then undetectable .",
    "similar behaviour is well - known in the case of lensing by an individual star on the outskirts of a galaxy ( chang and refsdal , 1979 ) .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table6 ] .",
    "a host star with @xmath133 or approximately 0.2 solar mass can be excluded out to 400 einstein radii , i.e.  out to approximately 27 au or approximately the orbit radius of neptune . such a star would have caused a detectable deviation on the light curve .",
    "simulations with a star at larger distances showed little change in @xmath28 over the single lens fit .",
    "simulations were also conducted for host star masses of 0.08 , 0.4 and 0.8 solar masses .",
    "it was found they could be excluded out to 280 , 600 and 900 einstein radii , or approximately 19 , 40 and 60 au respectively .",
    "a search for a host star at a separation @xmath134 au could be carried out with the hubble space telescope . at a distance of 0.8",
    "kpc a separation @xmath134 au corresponds to an angular separation @xmath135 arcsec .",
    "a host star would therefore be detectable as a spatially resolved object close to the source star , or as additional flux exceeding the measured flux of the source star given in @xmath136 .",
    "absence of such a star would confirm the interpretation of the event as an isolated pmo .",

    "the masses of pmos found previously in star forming regions were derived from theoretical cooling curves , and the masses of pmos found previously by microlensing were deduced using statistical arguments .",
    "moa-2011-blg-274 was unusual because the lens transited the source , and because both the einstein angular radius and the einstein radius crossing time were consistent with values expected for a pmo .",

    "most of the crucial observations of moa-2011-blg-274 were carried out with ` backyard ' telescopes with apertures @xmath141 m located in new zealand or australia .",
    "if future events were observed with 1m - class or larger telescopes distributed over a larger portion of the earth s surface , then it appears possible that highly significant results on pmos would emerge .",
    "however , this could necessitate a change of current observing strategies .",
    "the critical observations by backyard telescopes of moa-2011-blg-274 were made continuously .",
    "if future events were observed with larger telescopes , these observations would also need to be made continuously , or nearly continuously , in order to realise a significant improvement in accuracy over the backyard observations reported here .    at present",
    "this is not a strategy that is generally employed , but it could be implemented by groups such as the las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ) .",
    "certainly the geographical location of the lcogt telescopes is ideal , with three sites in the southern hemisphere and two in the north .",
    "a second problem is the difficulty of triggering efficiently on scarce , rapid events .",
    "the scarcity of transiting pmo events may be seen as follows .",
    "the moa and ogle collaborations observe a few events per year in which normal stellar lenses transit a main sequence source star . if pmos are approximately twice as abundant as stars , as the results of sumi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) indicate , we may expect twice as many events per year in which a pmo transits a source .",
    "this suggests a few suitable events per year in the fields presently monitored by moa and ogle that are close enough ( @xmath142 kpc ) to permit a parallax measurement .",
    "a similarly low rate was estimated recently by gould and yee ( 2013 ) .",
    "with this low rate , a network such as lcogt would need to trigger efficiently on suitable events .",
    "the fact that this was done successfully in the case of moa-2011-blg-274 demonstrates it is possible",
    ".    another possibility would be for a network such as the korean microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet ) to monitor two ( say ) fields alternately rather than the greater number they presently plan to observe ( henderson et al ,  2014 ) .",
    "this would yield exquisite data on fewer events , but it should include a sample of high - quality transiting pmo events",
    ". this option would also enjoy sensitivity to pmos of lower masses than those reported by sumi et al .",
    "it is now known that bound terrestrial planets outnumber bound giant planets by a factor of a few ( cassan et al .",
    "if a similar distinction applies to isolated pmos , then the kmtnet may be able to detect pmos down to super - earth mass , assuming that their strategy could be modified .",
    "we re - analysed the short time - scale , high - magnification microlensing event moa-2011-blg-274 that was monitored by 0.3m - class and larger telescopes .",
    "we used re - reduced photometry and confirmed the possible interpretation of the event by choi et al .",

    "we proposed observational strategies employing high - cadence observations with 1m - class telescopes to enable higher quality measurements to be made in future events .",
