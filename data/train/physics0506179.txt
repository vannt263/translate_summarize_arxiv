    "field - free alignment is possible by sudden excitation using pulses much shorter than the rotational period of the molecule.@xcite achieving orientation with short pulses is more difficult since spatial symmetry breaking is required to give the direction of orientation , but it can be done using half - cycle pulses@xcite or specially tailored laser pulses.@xcite this has led to different proposals for alignment and orientation using series of short impulses ( kicks).@xcite see also the recent review of the subject by stapelfeldt and seideman , and references therein.@xcite    the purpose of the present study is to find the electromagnetic fields that produce the best possible orientation or alignment .",

    "( [ eq : expand ] ) are kept , and we have checked that the results are not affected by using a bigger basis .    because of the presence of both the dipole moment @xmath18 and the polarizability anisotropy @xmath19 , the results are not molecule - independent .",
    "however , the role of the polarizability is negligible for the fields obtained , making them applicable to any linear molecule with a proper scaling of the amplitude and frequency of the electric field .",
    "the results will thus be presented with time expressed in units of the rotational period @xmath20 , the electrical field as @xmath21 , and energy as @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters actually used in the calculations are those for the hcn molecule : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( all in atomic units ) .",

    "the expectation value of @xmath31 is 1 when the molecule is aligned , starting from @xmath32 for the isotropic case .",

    "we point out that , in any case , this penalty term is not an essential ingredient of the monotonic algorithm and can be relaxed ( e.g. , to allow fluences achievable with laser pulses ) or completely eliminated .",
    "the downside of such a cost functional is that it takes into account only the efficiency of the orientation / alignment , not its persistence .",
    "once the field is turned off , the free rotation of the molecule will lead to the disappearance of the orientation / alignment as the different @xmath10 components in the wave function dephase , followed by revivals at intervals of one rotational period.@xcite the best orientation / alignment is obtained by confining the molecule to a narrow angular distribution @xmath41 , which corresponds to exciting a broad rotational band @xmath42 by referring to an uncertainty principle @xmath43.@xcite the problem is then that , conversely , a broad rotational spectrum exhibits narrow features in the time domain , i.e. , the greater the orientation / alignment , the shorter its duration .",
