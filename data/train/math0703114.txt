    "threshold graphs are a well - studied class of graphs motivated from numerous directions .",
    "they were first introduced by chvtal and hammer  @xcite as graphs for which there exists a linear threshold function separating independent from non - independent sets . since",
    "then many equivalent conditions have been found for threshold graphs including constructive forms and forbidden configurations .",
    "see for example  @xcite for nine different characterizations .    in generalizing to higher dimensions , it is then natural to consider which characterizations remain equivalent .",
    "golumbic first considered such generalizations of threshold graphs to higher dimensions ( or hypergraphs )  @xcite .",
    "he specifically highlighted three analogs and asked if they were in fact the same .",
    "it turns out that these three do not lead to the same class of complexes  @xcite .",
    "one of these analogs does give the class known as shifted simplicial complexes .",
    "we will primarily consider threshold graphs from this perspective ; that they are exactly the one - dimensional shifted complexes .",
    "see also  @xcite which considers generalizations of threshold graphs based on degree sequence properties and  @xcite for a simple games / voting theory perspective .    shifted complexes are simplicial complexes whose faces form an order ideal in the component - wise partial order .",
    "( see section  [ sec : def ] for precise definitions and examples of shifted complexes and threshold graphs . )",
    "shifted complexes are named as such because of the existence of shifting operations . in general , a shifting operation associates a shifted complex to any simplicial complex in a way which preserves certain combinatorial properties but simplifies other structure .",
    "the original form of shifting , now known as combinatorial shifting , was first introduced by erds , ko , and rado  @xcite and kleitman  @xcite .",
    "more recently , kalai  @xcite introduced algebraic shifting and spurred new interest in shifted complexes .",
    "we study a variety of simplicial complexes naturally formed from a simple graph .",
    "in many cases , these graphical complexes turn out to be shifted if and only if the graph is threshold .",
    "we thus further motivate shiftedness as a natural generalization of threshold graphs .",
    "we first look at the independent set ( or stable set ) complex of a graph and show that it is shifted if and only if the graph is threshold . using this , we determine a constructible form for such complexes in terms of two simple operations . independent set complexes of graphs are also known as flag complexes . combining this perspective and the construction",
    ", it is shown that pure shifted flag complexes are the same as pure shifted balanced complexes .",
    "next we consider a generalized procedure to form the independent set complex of an arbitrary simplicial complex as in  @xcite .",
    "this construction again yields a shifted complex if and only if we start with a shifted complex .",
    "finally , we end with a result which shows that the dominance complex of a graph equals the neighborhood complex if and only if the graph is threshold .",
    "a simplicial complex on @xmath0 vertices is _ shifted _ if there exists a labeling of the vertices by one through @xmath0 such that for any face @xmath1 , replacing any @xmath2 by a vertex with a smaller label results in a collection which is also a face .",
    "an equivalent formulation of shifted complexes is in terms of order ideals .",
    "an order ideal @xmath3 of a poset @xmath4 is a subset of @xmath4 such that if @xmath5 is in @xmath3 and @xmath6 is less than @xmath5 then @xmath6 is in @xmath3 . let @xmath7 be the partial ordering on strings of increasing integers given by @xmath8 is less than @xmath9 if @xmath10 for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 . shifted complexes are exactly the order ideals of @xmath7 .",
    "we also allow comparisons of strings of various lengths by considering the shorter string to have the necessary number of initial zeros ( slightly abusing that we are otherwise comparing strictly increasing strings ) .",
    "for example the string @xmath13 is taken to be less than the string @xmath14 by considering @xmath13 as @xmath15 .",
    "_ a simplicial complex which includes the face @xmath16 must also have the face @xmath17 in order to be shifted ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) . _",
    "one - dimensional shifted complexes are known to be the same as threshold graphs  @xcite .",
    "threshold graphs are graphs that can be given a vertex weighting which differentiates between independent and non - independent sets .",
    "an _ independent set _ of a graph is a collection of vertices no two of which are connected .",
    "[ def : threshold ] a graph is threshold if for all @xmath18 there exists weights @xmath19 , and @xmath20 such that the following condition holds : @xmath21 if and only if @xmath22 is an independent set , where @xmath23 ( see figure @xmath24 ) .",
    "one of the many characterizations of threshold graphs is constructive .",
    "the construction is in terms of two basic operations ; starring a vertex and adding a disjoint vertex . starring a vertex @xmath25 onto a graph @xmath26 forms the new graph : @xmath27    starring adds a new vertex adjacent to all previous vertices .    [ @xcite theorem 1.2.4 ] a graph is threshold if and only if it can be constructed from the one - vertex graph by repeatedly adding a disjoint vertex or a starred vertex .",
    "we want to extend the notion of starring a vertex to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "namely , we will say a vertex @xmath25 is starred in dimension @xmath28 onto a complex @xmath29 by forming the complex : @xmath30 note that this operation is not the same as coning .",
    "coning corresponds to the special case of starring a vertex in dimension one more than the dimension of the complex .",
    "coning will always increase the dimension of a complex whereas starring does not necessarily increase the dimension .",
    "for example , let @xmath29 be the two - dimensional simplex @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath29 star@xmath32 @xmath33 is the two - dimensional boundary complex of the three - dimensional simplex .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath34 is the three - dimensional simplex @xmath35 .",
    "we will represent complexes generated by these two operations as strings of @xmath36s ( disjoint ) , @xmath37s ( starring ) , and vertical lines @xmath38 ( for dimension increase ) .",
    "consider the string @xmath39 .",
    "this represents the complex formed as follows : place two disjoint vertices , star two vertices in dimension @xmath40 , star two vertices in dimension @xmath24 , add a disjoint vertex , and star one vertex in dimension @xmath41 .",
    "note that the string @xmath42 would give the same complex . for consistency",
    ", we will always place a vertical bar only immediately preceding an @xmath37 .",
    "also note that it does not matter whether we begin a string with an @xmath37 or a @xmath36 . again for consistency , we will always start a string with a @xmath36 .",
    "given a complex represented by such a string , a shifted labeling can easily be obtained .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a complex with @xmath0 vertices , @xmath43 of which were added by starring .",
    "label the vertices corresponding to @xmath37 operations by @xmath40 through @xmath43 from right to left along the string .",
    "label the vertices represented by @xmath36 operations by @xmath44 through @xmath0 from left to right along the string .",
    "the string above would give :    @xmath45    while all complexes formed this way are shifted , not all shifted complexes can be constructed by repeated application of these two operations .",
    "for example the complex of figure  [ fig:1 ] does not have this form .",
    "recall that an _ independent set _ ( or stable set ) of a graph is a collection of vertices no two of which are connected by an edge .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the independence complex of a graph @xmath47 .",
    "this complex is formed by taking the collection of independent sets of @xmath47 . clearly removing a node from an independent set results in an independent set so",
    "this collection is a simplicial complex .",
    "[ thm : i(g ) ] @xmath46 is shifted if and only if @xmath47 is a threshold graph .",
    "let @xmath47 be a threshold graph .",
    "then we know @xmath47 is shifted .",
    "let @xmath48 be a shifted labeling of the vertices of @xmath47 .",
    "consider any face @xmath49 of @xmath46 and a vertex @xmath50 such that @xmath51 for some @xmath11 .",
    "we will show that @xmath52 is a face of @xmath46 .",
    "if not , then @xmath50 must be connected to some @xmath53 in @xmath47 . because @xmath50 has a larger label than @xmath2 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 must be an edge of @xmath47 in order for @xmath47 to be shifted .",
    "but this contradicts @xmath56 being a face of @xmath46 .",
    "hence @xmath46 is shifted under the reverse ordering of @xmath48 .",
    "now let @xmath46 be shifted and @xmath48 a shifted labeling .",
    "consider any edge , @xmath57 of @xmath47 and a vertex @xmath50 such that @xmath58 .",
    "we will show that @xmath59 is an edge of @xmath47 and hence @xmath47 is shifted again under the reverse ordering of @xmath48 . if not , then @xmath59 is an independent set of @xmath47 and hence a face of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath46 is shifted and @xmath60 had a smaller label than @xmath50 which means @xmath57 must be a face of @xmath46 and not an edge of @xmath47 , again a contradiction .",
    "independent set complexes of graphs are also known as flag complexes .",
    "complex is defined as a simplicial complex such that every minimal non - face has exactly two elements  @xcite . by the previous result ,",
    "all shifted flag complexes are formed from threshold graphs .",
    "using both perspectives allows us to further determine the form of these complexes",
    ".    shifted flag complexes are the complexes formed by the operations @xmath36 and @xmath37 with exactly one @xmath37 in each dimension .",
    "every shifted flag complex arises as the independence complex of a threshold graph .",
    "every threshold graph can be represented as a string of @xmath36s and @xmath37s .",
    "consider mapping this string under the following rules : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "namely , switch every @xmath37 to a @xmath36 and switch every @xmath36 to an @xmath37 and also increase the dimension with every such switch .",
    "@xmath63    first , we want to determine the independent sets of a threshold graph from its string of @xmath36s and @xmath37s .",
    "the maximal independent sets are the set of all @xmath36s and all collections which consist of a single @xmath37 and all @xmath36s that come after it .",
    "next , given the image of the string , we want to determine its facets .",
    "they are the set of all @xmath37s and all collections which consist of a @xmath36 and all @xmath37s that come after it .",
    "in particular they are exactly the independent sets of @xmath47 .",
    "this procedure is invertible showing that all strings of @xmath36s and @xmath37s with exactly one @xmath37 in each dimension are flag complexes .",
    "a @xmath28-dimensional simplicial complex is _ balanced _ if its vertices can be colored with @xmath64 colors such that within any face all vertices have different colors .",
    "all shifted flag complexes are balanced .",
    "let @xmath29 be a @xmath28-dimensional shifted flag complex .",
    "we give an explicit balanced labeling .",
    "@xmath29 can be represented as a string of @xmath36s and @xmath37s with exactly one star operation per dimension .",
    "label the vertices with @xmath64 colors as shown below :    @xmath65    every face of @xmath29 consists of one initially placed disjoint vertex and a set of starred vertices which come after it , all of which have been given a different color .",
    "the converse of the proposition above is false : not all shifted balanced complexes are flag complexes .",
    "a simple example is the complex on 4 vertices with maximal faces @xmath66 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "notice that this complex is not pure .",
    "a pure shifted flag complex has a very simple form : @xmath67 this yields a `` pencil of facets '' .",
    "namely , a @xmath28-dimensional pure shifted flag complex on @xmath0 vertices consists of @xmath68 facets all sharing a common @xmath69 face .",
    "a pure shifted complex is balanced if and only if it is a flag complex .",
    "we already know flag implies balanced .",
    "we will show any pure shifted balanced complex is also a `` pencil of facets '' .",
    "let @xmath29 be a @xmath28-dimensional pure , shifted , and balanced complex with a shifted labeling of its vertices .",
    "shiftedness implies that @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) be some other facet .",
    ". then @xmath75 must be greater than @xmath64 and vertex @xmath76 must be adjacent to @xmath64 .",
    "but then shiftedness implies that the complete graph on @xmath77 vertices is in the @xmath40-skeleton of @xmath29 which contradicts @xmath29 being balanced .",
    "hence @xmath78 must equal @xmath28 and all facets have the form @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath29 has the same form as a pure shifted flag complex .",
    "recall that in general , a shifting operation associates a shifted complex to any simplicial complex in a way which preserves certain combinatorial properties but simplifies other structure . in particular , both combinatorial and algebraic shifting preserve the @xmath80-vector .    a conjecture due to kalai asks if any @xmath80-vector of a flag complex can also be realized as the @xmath80-vector of a balanced complex  @xcite .",
    "we note here for completeness the relationship between shifting and the properties of flag and balanced .",
    "the two main variants of algebraic shifting unfortunately do not preserve flag or balanced complexes . for definitions and much more on these shifting operations see  @xcite .",
    "consider the complete bipartite graph @xmath81 .",
    "it is easy to check that this is both a flag and balanced complex .",
    "symmetric shifting yields the complex generated by top face @xmath82 and exterior shifting yields the complex generated by top faces @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in both graphs , the collection @xmath31 is a minimal non - face showing it is not a flag complex and not balanced .",
    "moreover , no shifting operation which preserves the @xmath80-vector could preserve these properties .",
    "the graph @xmath81 has 6 vertices , 9 edges , and no faces of dimension 2 or greater . but",
    "any order ideal in the shifted partial order on 6 vertices with 9 one - dimensional faces will include the edges @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "hence the graph will not be balanced and since we can not add any two - dimensional faces , this will generate a minimal non - face with three elements .",
    "in  @xcite , forming the independence complex of a graph is generalized to arbitrary simplicial complexes . for a simplicial complex @xmath29 ,",
    "define @xmath88 by declaring the facets of @xmath29 to be the minimal non - faces of @xmath88 .",
    "( the independent set complex in  @xcite is defined in greater generality , allowing for @xmath29 to be a set system which is not necessarily a simplicial complex . )    we start by considering the independent set complex of shifted simplicial complexes . the general statement that @xmath29 is shifted if and only if @xmath88 is shifted is false in both directions .",
    "it is not hard to construct counter - examples using non - pure complexes .",
    "for example , let @xmath29 be the simplicial complex on @xmath89 vertices with maximal faces @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath29 is shifted but @xmath88 which has maximal faces @xmath91 is not .",
    "the induced subcomplex on vertices @xmath92 is a path of length three which is an obstruction to shiftedness in dimension one .",
    "we can continue to apply the procedure to disprove the other direction .",
    "@xmath93 is generated by @xmath94 which is also not shifted .",
    "@xmath95 generated by @xmath96 is however shifted ( mapping @xmath97 gives a shifted labeling ) .",
    "restricting to the pure case is actually a more natural generalization of the independence complex of a graph .",
    "the generalized procedure only restricts to the same procedure on graphs if the graph is connected ( i.e. pure ) .",
    "for example , if we have a graph with disjoint vertices , under the generalized procedure they would be minimal non - faces of @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "a disjoint vertex is in all maximal faces of the independence complex of the graph . in the pure case , we come to the following result :      suppose @xmath29 is shifted but @xmath88 is not shifted",
    ". then there exists @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are vertices and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are faces , see  @xcite . since @xmath103 and @xmath104 are not in @xmath88 , they must be facets or contain facets of @xmath29 .",
    "first we note that the facets involved here must not be strictly contained in @xmath101 and @xmath102 , or @xmath104 and @xmath103 could not be in @xmath88 .",

    "they will not be in @xmath88 , but @xmath114 and @xmath115 so we are back in the first case .",
    "now suppose @xmath88 is shifted but @xmath29 is not shifted .",
