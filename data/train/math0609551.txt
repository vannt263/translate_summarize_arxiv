    "@xcite on the stability of bps d - branes .",
    "it is a fine mixture of the theory of @xmath1-structures @xcite and the slope stability @xcite , which allows us to represent any object in a triangulated category as a successive mapping cone of semistable objects in a unique way .",
    "he proved that the set @xmath2 of stability conditions on a triangulated category @xmath3 satisfying an additional assumption called local - finiteness has a natural structure of a complex manifold , and proposed to study this manifold as an invariant of @xmath3 .",
    "since the definition of stability conditions uses only the triangulated structure of @xmath3 , the group @xmath4 of triangle autoequivalences of @xmath3 naturally acts on the manifold @xmath2 , suggesting a geometric approach to study the structure of @xmath4 .",
    "such an approach has been pursued by bridgeland himself @xcite when @xmath3 is the bounded derived category @xmath5 of coherent sheaves on a complex algebraic @xmath6 surface @xmath7 , leading him to the following remarkable result and conjecture : there is a distinguished connected component @xmath8 of the space @xmath9 of locally finite , numerical stability conditions on @xmath5 .",

    "the categories @xmath18 and @xmath15 serve as toy models of the derived categories of coherent sheaves on @xmath6 surfaces .",

    "this result , together with the simply - connectedness of a distinguished connected component of @xmath21 proved by thomas @xcite , shows that the above conjecture of bridgeland holds in these cases . when @xmath23 , the connectedness of @xmath22 has also been proved by okada @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy of our proof for the connectedness of @xmath22 is to find a stability condition such that structure sheaves of all the closed points are stable in any given connected component of @xmath22 . since the set of such stability conditions form a distinguished connected open subset of @xmath22 , the connectedness of @xmath22 follows .",

    "unfortunately , we have to work over a field of characteristic two in order to apply theorem [ theorem : khovanov - seidel ] by khovanov and seidel , and we lift this faithfulness result to any characteristic using the deformation theory of complexes by inaba @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath22 , we can not use algebro - geometric argument in the proof of the connectedness of @xmath21 , since @xmath18 does not contain any skyscraper sheaves .",
