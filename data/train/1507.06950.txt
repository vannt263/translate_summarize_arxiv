    "two distinct phases form at small - scale well separated stripes , which are themselves entangled , leading to a complex large - scale pattern .",
    "these shapes were experimentally obtained for extremely varied two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems ranging from ferrimagnetic garnet films  @xcite in condensed matter and langmuir monolayer  @xcite in soft matter , to granular fluid suspension in which air penetrates  @xcite , ferrofluid drop  @xcite and biphasic ferrofluid - oil layer  @xcite in fluids mechanics , and chemical reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite .",
    "the common denominator of these systems is the competition between long - range repulsion and short - range attraction , which leads to the phenomenology of modulated phases  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a wide range of ordering effects that lead to different patterns can also be related to the competition between interactions and geometrical frustration , as specifically shown for magnetic thin films  @xcite .    by analogy with the phenomenology of these continuous systems ,",
    "labyrinthine and stripe phases have been introduced for systems of particles . in particular in the context of colloidal monolayers ,",
    "several monte - carlo simulations  @xcite and one molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite have been performed .",
    "it was shown that , to observe stripes and labyrinthine phases , a long - range repulsive potential is needed , together with a short - range attraction which can be replaced by a core - softened potential  @xcite .",
    "tuning geometrical frustration in non - interacting colloidal monolayers  @xcite leads also to stripe phases .",
    "moreover the only experimental observation of a labyrinthine phase in a colloidal system was obtained using superparamagnetic colloids under a magnetic field , inducing dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "labyrinthine phases were indeed found as equilibrium states at high enough density of micrometric spheres in agreement with dedicated monte - carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , similar labyrinthine or stripe phases have not been described in a macroscopic and out - of - equilibrium system whose particles can be individually identified .     chromed steel spherical particles ( diameter  @xmath0 mm and mass @xmath1 mg ) are vertically vibrated ( acceleration  @xmath2m.s@xmath3 ) inside a horizontal , square aluminium cell ( area @xmath4@xmath5 ) with a rough bottom plate and a polycarbonate top lid ( gap size @xmath6 ) . in presence of a vertical magnetic field",

    "a monolayer of soft ferromagnetic spheres of 1 mm in diameter is vibrated to form a 2d granular gas  @xcite . under mechanical agitation particles",
    "undergo a brownian - like motion , but due to the dissipative nature of the collisions , the granular gas reaches a stationary out - of - equilibrium state . then immersed in a vertical external magnetic field @xmath7 ,",
    "the soft ferromagnetic spheres are magnetized and interact with each other as induced dipoles .",
    "when the magnetic field is increased , the granular gas solidifies into a phase composed of chains of a few particles in contact , similar to the labyrinthine phase observed with colloids  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this colloid study which focuses on equilibrium states , the transition from gas to labyrinth is here clearly described , using an accurate particle tracking . finally as a remark",
    ", we emphasize that the physical mechanisms at play in labyrinthine and stripe phases of interacting particles , differ from those in chain and cluster phases reported in some interacting granular gases  @xcite , despite visual similarities . indeed ,",
    "these phases are composed of head - to - tail dipoles and were observed when attractive behavior is dominant at large scale , because permanent dipoles are considered  @xcite or because the hypothesis of a quasi-2d system is not verified  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is similar to the one used in  @xcite .",
    "soft ferromagnetic spherical particles of diameter @xmath10 mm are confined between two horizontal parallel plates separated by a gap @xmath6 in order to form a monolayer as depicted in fig .",

    "additional details on the experimental setup and protocol , and on the particle detection technique , are given in the appendices .",
    "magnetized soft ferromagnetic spheres behave as induced dipoles , whose magnetic moments are vertical and proportional to @xmath7 .",

    "particles undergo a brownian - like motion . at a given instant particle positions are random [ fig .",

    "we observe a 2d granular gas , whose properties are similar to those found at lower area fraction  @xcite . then by increasing @xmath7",
    "further , we observe that despite the magnetic repulsion , small chains of two or three particles in contact are starting to form in the bulk of agitated particles .",
    "we remark also that the motions of the particles belonging to these chains are considerably restricted compared to those of the free particles . at higher magnetic field ,",
    "the quasi - totality of the particles are condensed into these chains [ fig .",
    "[ fig : f2](b ) ] . at large - scale",
    ", the picture of the assembly of the system does not present an ordered structure .",
    "thus , by increasing magnetic interactions , the system has been solidified in an amorphous state .",
    "labyrinthine patterns were indeed described as globally disordered stripe domains  @xcite . due to the presence of chains ,",
    "the particle assembly presents striking similarities with the labyrinthine and stripe phases observed  @xcite and numerically predicted  @xcite for example for 2d colloidal systems under thermal agitation and with dipolar repulsive magnetic interactions . here , a transition from a granular gas phase to a labyrinthine phase for a macroscopic , out - of - equilibrium system is observed .",
    "this transition can be also visualized by applying a linearly increasing magnetic field from @xmath23 g to @xmath24 g ( see movie in supplemental material   for a movie of the transition ] ) .",
    "first , pairs aggregate , then triplets , and so on homogeneously across the cell , until nearly motionless chains of various lengths occupy the whole cell , isolating the few remaining fluctuating particles from each other .",
    "we notice also that , starting from the labyrinthine phase , the inverse transition is observed when the magnetic field is decreased .",
    "this shows that the system does not present any noticeable hysteresis . + by the means of an accurate particle tracking",
    ", chain morphology can be now quantitatively characterized .",
    "chains are well separated due to the magnetic repulsion and can be thus considered as groups of more than one particle , according to a criterion of the contact distance .",
    "moreover chains appear mainly as linear objects because , most of the time , a particle inside a chain is in contact with two neighboring particles .",
    "nevertheless the relative orientations of the chains seem random . in the following",
    ", quantitative analysis of the small - scale structure will reveal that chains correspond to a buckled state of particles in contact [ fig .",
    "[ fig : f2](c ) ] .",
    "a particle , once it is condensed in a chain , is either in contact with the top plate or with the bottom plate .",
    "using slight differences of lighting for the two kinds of particles , our detection technique is able to provide the vertical position of the particles in the chains [ as shown in virtual image fig .",
    "[ fig : f2](d ) ] , that is coded as _ up _ ( red ) or _ down _ ( blue ) .",
    "it can be noticed that the particles at the tips of the chains are for the most part _ down _ , revealing an effect of gravity .",
    "let us now quantitatively characterize the transition from granular gas to the labyrinthine phase using the particle tracking data .",
    "the magnetic potential energy @xmath25 and the horizontal kinetic energy @xmath26 per particle can be now computed . from the interaction potential @xmath27",

    "the magnetic potential energy depends on the local configuration of the particles , and therefore it fluctuates in time .",
    "its averaged value , @xmath25 , is found to be proportional to @xmath35 [ fig .",

    "@xmath26 is a measure of the agitation in the system .",
    "when the magnetic field @xmath7 is increased , in a first stage @xmath26 grows [ fig .",
    "[ fig : f2s](b ) ] .",
    "repulsive dipole - dipole interactions reduce the rate of dissipative collisions , which increases consequently @xmath26 for a given shaking amplitude  @xcite .",
    "once chains start to form , for @xmath43 g , @xmath26 drops significantly and nearly vanishes as the labyrinthine phase is formed for @xmath44 g , illustrating the solidification process . for higher magnetic excitation values ,",
    "the labyrinthine phase becomes less and less mobile as interactions strengthen and fluctuations are restrained .",
    "( the dashed curve is a @xmath35 fit ) .",
    "( b )  the kinetic energy , which measures agitation , plotted as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "first , @xmath26 increases due to the fluidizing effect of the magnetic interactions @xcite , then it suddenly drops towards zero at the onset of the solidification ( @xmath45 g ) . ]        now , let us define the dimensionless control parameter @xmath46  @xcite , which is depicted as a function of @xmath7 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : f3](a ) .",
    "@xmath47 provides a measure of the competition between distance interactions and kinetic agitation . by analogy with an order parameter ,",
    "the fraction of particles condensed in the chains @xmath48 is computed as the ratio of the number of particles belonging to a group of more than one particle to the total number of particles tracked in the region of interest . by plotting @xmath48 as a function of @xmath47 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3](a ) , the transition is well depicted .",
    "for @xmath49 , @xmath48 is nearly null in the granular gas phase , whereas for @xmath50 , @xmath48 is slightly smaller than one , for the labyrinthine phase .",
    "the intermediate region of partial solidification corresponds to a coexistence zone between fluidized particles and particles condensed in the chains .",
    "let us emphasize that , although the simple criterion of the variation of @xmath48 captures well the transition from a granular gas to a labyrinthine phase , it should fail to distinguish a stripe phase from a labyrinthine phase .",
    "topology and morphology would indeed have to be taken into account , like local orientational properties .",
    "several approaches were proposed to analyze or to model labyrinthine patterns , such as the introduction of a local wave vector  @xcite , the computation of the wrinkledness  @xcite , and the decomposition of the pattern into clusters of linear segments  @xcite . to our knowledge , the definition of an appropriate order parameter for labyrinthine patterns remains an open question .",
    "nonetheless , aiming at quantifying some of the directly observable morphological changes of the chains , we evaluate their mean length @xmath51 as a function of @xmath47 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : f3](b ) ]",
    ". @xmath51 is defined as the average over all chains of the largest distance between particle centers inside a given chain .",
    "starting from @xmath52 at the formation of first chains , @xmath51 seems to saturate for the highest values of @xmath47 around @xmath53 .",
    "this suggests that competition between growing chains could limit their extension .",
    "+ the pair correlation function , which is related to the probability of finding a particle center at a given distance from another particle center , provides information on the small - scale structure of the system . before the transition",
    ", the particle assembly evolves from a purely dissipative gas to an effectively more elastic gas  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as fig .",
    "[ fig : f3](c ) ( red and purple lines ) displays , the peak at the diameter value flattens whilst the effective elasticity rises up . from the onset of solidification ( green , orange and blue lines )",
    ", surprisingly an extremely sharp peak grows from zero at the distance value @xmath54 , which is smaller than the particle diameter .",
    "this peak , which would be impossible to observe in purely 2d systems of hard spheres , reveals the internal structure of the chains .",
    "here the gap size is indeed large enough so that partial overlaps of particles are allowed , leading to the formation of buckled particle chains in which particles are in contact with the top or bottom plate [ see schematic in fig .  [",
    "fig : f3](c ) ] .",
    "geometrical calculations yielding @xmath55 , one finds @xmath56 mm , which corresponds to the announced gap of @xmath57 mm diminished by the the roughness of the bottom plate .",
    "moreover in the labyrinthine phase ( blue line ) , @xmath58 exhibits also a shorter peak at the position @xmath59 , from the aligned second neighbors , showing the presence of linear chains . between these two peaks , a zero - probability at @xmath60 indicates the void spaces between the chains while the non - vanishing probability for @xmath61 stands for both non - aligned second neighbors in chains and particles from neighboring chains .",
    "the 3d effects related to the gap size @xmath62 are thus essential to describe the small - scale structure of the labyrinthine phase .",

    "circle mark depicts the initial central position and cross marks show the two contact positions . from these graphs , for @xmath20 and @xmath64 hexagonal configurations are found stables , whereas for @xmath63 and @xmath65 , the central particle in presence of agitation should leave the position @xmath66 to reach contact positions associated with the buckled chains . ]",
    "at low area fraction ( @xmath20 and lower ) , the stable state of the assembly of spheres in dipolar interaction was found to be a hexagonal crystal  @xcite . why does the hexagonal structure become now unstable at higher area fraction and",
    "how can we explain the formation of chains of particles in contact ?",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : f4](a ) , we plot the 3d magnetic energetic landscape ( in a vertical plane ) for a sphere initially in the center of a hexagon of 6 neighbouring particles , the projected horizontal distance between the particles being geometrically given by @xmath67 .",
    "let us consider this central particle at @xmath66 assumed _ up _ [ dashed circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](a ) ] between six _ down _ neighbors all at a distance @xmath68 , and investigate its potential energy when it moves from @xmath66 to the contact position for several values of @xmath21 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](b ) ] . contact positions between spheres are local minima of potential energy , as the dipolar interaction aims to align spheres along a vertical axis . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the central position is an absolute minimum of energy , in agreement with the expected stability of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "in contrast when @xmath21 is increased , the energy barrier decreases and @xmath69 augments relatively to @xmath70 . for @xmath63 contact positions become absolute minima , which can be reached by means of mechanical agitation . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the central position is not even a minimum anymore .",
    "therefore for @xmath63 and above , we expect that hexagonal structure is unstable , leading to local structures of spheres in contact like chains , despite the isotropic dipolar repulsion in a purely 2d system .",
    "this qualitative model explains the small - scale attraction leading to particle contacts , needed for the shaping and the stability of labyrinthine phases  @xcite . to improve the description ,",
    "solid friction between the spheres and the top and bottom plates should be incorporated , as it may greatly stabilize the buckled chains . in thermal systems ,",
    "similar predictions were obtained using monte - carlo simulations  @xcite . in both these examples and in our system , the resultant of repulsive interactions of the assembly of particles over one acts as a magnetic pressure , favoring contact at high enough particle density .",
    "additionally , we notice that buckled phases stabilized by pressure and friction can also appear in thin vibrated granular layers without magnetic interactions  @xcite if the density and gap size are sufficiently large .",
    ", the total number of particles should be larger than @xmath72 for such a buckled state to be observed  @xcite .",
    "] nevertheless , in this last case , the structuring in separated chains is absent .",
    "in this macroscopic and out - of - equilibrium model experiment , a labyrinthine phase is obtained by applying a magnetic field to a confined granular gas , by the means of externally controlled dipolar interactions .",
    "we describe and quantitatively characterize the transition from a gas - like phase towards a globally disordered solid phase .",
    "it appears as a three - dimensional effect occurring in a quasi - two - dimensional system .",
    "the parameters setting the confinement , the gap @xmath73 and the area fraction @xmath21 , are thus essential to explain the phase diagram of this granular medium , as it was also shown for colloidal and hard spheres monolayers  @xcite . although not presented here , after a fast increase of @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ a magnetic quench , the labyrinthine phase exhibits a slow dynamics characterized by a slow evolution of its structural properties  .",
    "this aging phenomenon should thus be compared to the slow dynamics of structural glasses  @xcite . in the case of labyrinthine domain patterns arising in continuous systems , the analogy with glasses",
    "was also reported in the analysis of their globally disordered structure  @xcite and when studying their relaxation  @xcite . finally , whereas the structure of the phases obtained in this macroscopic experiment resembles those found at thermal equilibrium in monte - carlo simulations and colloidal monolayers  @xcite , kinetics of the transition described here is intrinsically an out - of - equilibrium process , which deserves further studies .",
