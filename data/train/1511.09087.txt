    "recently , the quest for new thermoelectric materials beyond bi@xmath0te@xmath10 has gained considerable momentum which is owed to the increasing need of highly performing materials for energy harvesting and conversion .",

    "the calculations predict significant negative values of about @xmath18vk@xmath19 ( pdcoo@xmath0 ) and @xmath20vk@xmath19 ( ptcoo@xmath0 ) for the out - of - plane component of the thermopower at room temperature , in contrast to moderate @xmath21vk@xmath19 in - plane.@xcite such a large anisotropy in the thermopower can give rise to a considerable laser induced voltage , which can be exploited to design photosensors based on the transverse thermoelectric effect.@xcite    both compounds are stable and have been synthesized as high quality single crystals employing the so - called methathetical reaction.@xcite in ptcoo@xmath0 and pdcoo@xmath0 , the co ion is found in the trivalent co@xmath22 state , which shows a @xmath23@xmath6@xmath24 low spin configuration , while pd and pt are monovalent.@xcite experiment@xcite and first principles theory@xcite show consistently that the fermi level of pdcoo@xmath0 is populated by pd states , while oxygen states are scarce and co states are essentially absent .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy confirms the validity of this picture also for ptcoo@xmath0.@xcite thus the high in - plane conductivity arises from the hybridized noble metal 4d and 5s electrons which contribute states at the fermi level , whereas the coo@xmath25 octahedra can be thought to form an insulating layer , inhibiting transport along the perpendicular @xmath26-axis . the absence of hybridized co states at the fermi level results in a quasi - two - dimensional electronic arrangement .",

    "these values agree well with previous dft investigations@xcite and experiment ( @xmath55 for both compounds),@xcite with the typical over - estimation of the lattice constant by approximately one percent as a consequence of the use of the gga for the exchange - correlation potential .",

    "[ fig : ecvrel ] indicates that epitaxial growth with in - plane strains along @xmath15 of up to @xmath42% might be realistic , since the corresponding deformation energies are still in the range of typical thermal energies . applying in - plane strain results in a corresponding opposite strain of the out - of - plane lattice parameter @xmath17 , which is , however , approximately only half as large .",

    "the band structure of the unstrained delafossites , compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandboth ] , suggests at first sight that the electronic features relevant for the transport properties , which appear close to the fermi level , @xmath29 , are similar for both compounds . in both cases only one band ( i.e. , the 16th band of valence electrons disregarding the semicore states in counting ) is crossing @xmath29 which is formed by @xmath75 and @xmath76-type orbitals with pd / pt character.@xcite its rather steep slope in @xmath77-@xmath27-direction , which is responsible for the excellent in - plane conductivity , corresponds to a section of a parabolic structure , which has its mimium at @xmath78 at @xmath79ev for ptcoo@xmath0 and @xmath80ev for pdcoo@xmath0 and is intersected by hybridizing bands with d - character several times below @xmath29 .",
    "although most other bands of ptcoo@xmath0 are shifted downward due to the larger bandwidth related to the larger extent of the @xmath81 shell of pt compared to the @xmath82 electrons of pd , the 16th band does not change its shape in the immediate vicinity of @xmath29 .",
    "this is different for the next lower , completely filled band ( i.e. , the 15th band ) , which forms hole pockets in the vicinity of the zone boundary , in particular , near the special points f and l. the next higher unoccupied band ( 17th band ) displays a marked minimum ( electron pocket ) along @xmath78-l , which comprises co",
    "@xmath83 states@xcite that are absent in the vicinity of @xmath29 otherwise . in ptcoo@xmath0 , these features of the 15th and the 17th band come very close to @xmath29 within @xmath84mev , while in pdcoo@xmath0 , they are separated from the fermi surface by more than @xmath85mev . as we will show below",
    ", these fine details of the electronic structure give rise to qualitatively different transport properties under epitaxial strain which stand in contrast to the rather uniform elastic response of both systems .",
    "the energy minimum along @xmath78-f in the 17th band might be interpreted as a consequence of the hybridization between the co @xmath86 bands with the the parabolic section of the 16th band ( see the co - resolved band structure of ptcoo@xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsstrain]d-[fig : fsstrain]f ) , which manifests in a sharp peak in the electronic density of states @xmath87ev above the fermi level ( see supporting material@xcite and refs .   and for the density of states and orbital resolved band - plots ) , while the co @xmath88 and the pd @xmath89 and @xmath90 states are located @xmath91-@xmath68ev below @xmath29 . in comparison ,",
    "the hybridization between pt @xmath92 and co @xmath86 states is less pronounced and the band - crossing is encountered in the immediate vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "a strain - induced change of the brillouin - zone can influence the position of this crossing and thus show significant impact on the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "this might be exploited to alter transport properties by applying external fields , such as mechanical stress .",
    "the crossing of the 16th band results in a hexagonal rod - like shape of the fermi surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fsstrain]b ) , which is a pronounced feature of both compounds.@xcite under a moderate compressive epitaxial strain of @xmath56@xmath6@xmath71% , the extremal features of the 15th and 17th band of ptcoo@xmath0 touch the fermi surface and changes its topology significantly .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsstrain]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : fsstrain]d .",
    "the ( blue ) needle - type features outside the ( orange ) hexagonal rod evolve from the rising of the hole pocket in the 15th band , which is best seen at the l - point . at the same time , the 17th band approaches the fermi level along @xmath78-f from above resulting in the ( red ) pills inside the hexagonal rods . according to its pt - type band - character ( not shown )",
    ", we expect the 15th band to contribute predominantly to the in - plane conductivity .",
    "in turn , the 17th band shows a strong co - character close to its minimum where the electron pocket forms and is consequently expected to increase the out - of - plane conductivity ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : conduct ] ) .",
    "while the faces of the hexagon formed by the 16th band are essentially dispersionless irrespective of the strain , we find bulb - like extrusions at its rounded corners .",
    "the extrusions are also present on the fermi surface of pdcoo@xmath0 and are again associated to a slight admixture of co - states in band 16 along @xmath78-f.@xcite in ptcoo@xmath0 , these features grow under compressive strain and eventually touch the brillouin zone boundary , while they become significantly flatter under tensile strain , in turn .",
    "this corresponds to a diminished band velocity component in @xmath26-direction .",
    "tensile epitaxial strain is thus a suitable possibility to control the pd / pt - character of the 16th band and thus enhance the twodimensional nature of the electronic structure . in reverse",
    ", compressive strain can stimulate an electronic topological transition , which arises from the the appearance of additional bands at the fermi level and the 16th band touching the brillouin zone boundary . in pdcoo@xmath0 ,",
    "the distance between the co- and pd - states along @xmath78-f is significantly larger , which makes the electronic states at the fermi level much less susceptible to strain .",
    "however , electron doping may provide an alternative way to bring the systems close to this instability and produce a fermi surface of similar shape.@xcite    based on experimental evidence , ptcoo@xmath0 and",
    "pdcoo@xmath0 were considered as weakly correlated oxides.@xcite furthermore , ong _",
    "et al._@xcite found a very good agreement between the first - principles electronic structure and experimental spectroscopy , which justifies the use of conventional gga for the exchange and correlation part of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , recently , hicks _ et al .",
    "_ argued that static coulomb repulsion in terms of a hubbard model with an effective @xmath93-parameter on the co @xmath94 states improves the agreement with their de - haas - van - alphen data.@xcite therefore , we carried out additional gga+@xmath93 calculations for pdcoo@xmath0 and ptcoo@xmath0 under a systematic variation of the effective coulomb repulsion @xmath95@xmath6@xmath41 on co @xmath94 from @xmath24 ( pure gga ) to @xmath96ev .",
    "the additional term mainly affects the bonding @xmath94 co @xmath97 states below @xmath29 which move further down , while we observe only a minute shift in the position of the relevant co @xmath98 states , which are close to @xmath29 .",
    "this separates occupied and unoccupied co and o states further , but hardly affects the pd - states at the fermi surface , which are responsible for metallicity .",
    "thus @xmath95 has only minor effect on the position of the pt - dominated 15th band but larger values will eventually inhibit the crossing of the 17th band or shift it to larger strains .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the occurrence of the electronic topological transition is independent of the calculation method and likewise reproduced with vasp and wien2k .",
    "nevertheless , concerning the transport calculations we obtain slight differences between the codes .",
    "interestingly , we find a closer agreement of the gga results obtained from the wien2k calculations with the vasp calculations for @xmath95@xmath6@xmath99ev , rather than for the pure gga , although the same exchange - correlation functional ( pbe ) was used in both cases .",
    "we ascribe this to the specific implementation of the co paw - potential employed in the vasp calculations , which apparently allows for a somewhat stronger interaction between co and pd states resulting in a slightly increased presence of residual co - states at the fermi - level compared to the full - potential calculations . for additional details",
    "see the supplementary information.@xcite       ( upper panel ) and @xmath33 ( lower panel ) , as a function of epitaxial strain .",
    "the results are specified relative to the empirical parameter of boltzmann transport theory , the relaxation time constant @xmath100 .",
    "we compare the two different compounds pdcoo@xmath0 ( dashed lines and squares ) and ptcoo@xmath0 ( solid lines and circles ) are compared at two different temperatures @xmath8@xmath6@xmath85k ( open symbols ) and @xmath8@xmath6@xmath101k ( filled symbols ) .",
    "please note the semi - logarithmic scale in the bottom panel . ]",
    "starting from the electronic eigenvalues obtained with dft , we determined the transport properties in the framework of semi - classical boltzmann transport theory using the constant relaxation time approximation .",
    "this approach has evolved as a standard tool for the prediction and identification of qualitative trends in a wide variety of materials,@xcite including the prediction of oxidic systems,@xcite and has been applied successfully to several delafossites in the past.@xcite concerning pdcoo@xmath0 and ptcoo@xmath0 , particular emphasis was laid on the explanation of the large anisotropy in conductivity and thermopower ( seebeck coefficient),@xcite but also on the description of the large out - of - plane magnetoresistance encountered in pdcoo@xmath0 under the rotation of a large in - plane magnetic field.@xcite the relaxation time approximation , with a single energy- and momentum - independent relaxation time , assumes that the combined effect of all scattering processes is such that the electronic system relaxes back to equilibrium exponentially with a single time constant once the perturbation is switched off .",
    "alternatively , one may consider this approach as a first step towards the complete description which clarifies the _ band structure related _ aspects of transport . in any case",
    ", the relaxation time approximation allows for solving the boltzmann equation in a simple way , and hence an accurate determination of transport coefficients using @xmath102 to @xmath103 @xmath28-points , which are necessary for converged results . from the comparison with experiment , on the other hand",
    ", one is then able to deduce information on the relevant scattering mechanisms .",
    "a more detailed theoretical description could be based on boltzmann theory , but would require a first - principles calculation of phonon dispersions as well as electron - phonon scattering matrix elements , which is beyond the scope of the present work . alternatively , the determination of transport coefficients could be based directly on a green s function approach and kubo s linear response theory ( see ref .   for a recent discussion ) .    at room temperature and above",
    ", it can be expected that electron - phonon scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism .",
    "for the nearly - free electron model , the scattering operator indeed has been studied in detail.@xcite for example , it is well known that for temperatures below the debye temperature , the momentum and energy relaxation rates are very different , the latter being much shorter than the former . above the debye temperature , electron - phonon scattering is essentially elastic , and both rates are very similar .",
    "these results rely , in particular , strongly on the fact that the electronic density of states ( dos ) is practically independent of energy around the fermi level .",
    "thus predictions based on an energy - independent @xmath100 are likely to fail in case sharp features exist close to @xmath29 .",
    "this was shown recently for the simple metal li , where the constant relaxation time approximation predicts the wrong sign of the thermopower.@xcite for li , quantitative agreement can be achieved within a variational approach to boltzmann theory.@xcite since our calculated transport properties are consistent with the available experimental data for pdcoo@xmath0 , as shown below , we do not expect significant new insights from an advanced treatment of the boltzmann equation .",
    "however , our results will demonstrate clearly that  according to the anisotropic nature of the lattice structure ",
    "one must take into account at least a directional dependence of @xmath100 in addition to its variation with temperature . in practice ,",
    "all transport tensors obtained from boltzmann transport theory turn out to be essentially diagonal ; there are only two distinct entries .",
    "the first , marked with the index `` xx '' , corresponding to in - plane transport , the second , marked as `` zz '' corresponding to transport properties perpendicular to the co - o and pd - o / pt - o layers .",
    "as already anticipated , the significant changes at the fermi surface of ptcoo@xmath0 should leave a corresponding signature in the strain - dependent conductivity , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] .",
    "the variation of the in - plane component , which accounts for the already very good conductivity in this direction , is not substantial ( upper panel ) . according to the steeper slope at @xmath29",
    ", we find a larger ratio @xmath104 for ptcoo@xmath0 compared to pdcoo@xmath0 .",
    "both values are steadily reduced for tensile strains . however , as indicated earlier , the conductivity is highly anisotropic and thus orders of magnitude smaller in the perpendicular direction . according to the changes in the fermi surface , the strain induced variation of the out - of - plane conductivity is much more significant for bulk ptcoo@xmath0 . expanding the @xmath15-axis by 4% decreases the out - of - plane conductivity by almost one order of magnitude . in turn , the opposite trend is encountered for compressive strain .",
    "this significantly increases the conductivity compared to pdcoo@xmath0 , where the variations are much smaller and do not exhibit a consistent trend for both strain directions .     and @xmath33 of the electronic conductivity tensor at @xmath8@xmath6@xmath24 of ptcoo@xmath0 as a function of the in - plane lattice constant @xmath15 .",

    "only three bands crossing @xmath29 contribute to the transport properties . ]",
    "the strong impact of the fermi surface on the conductivity anisotropy in ptcoo@xmath0 is explained by the band resolved in - plane and out - of - plane components of the electrical conductivity tensor of ptcoo@xmath0 ( fig .",

    "we see that for tensile strains only the 16th band contributes since it is still the only one crossing the fermi surface .",

    "[ fig : sigbands ] . for tensile strains ,",

    "its strong decrease can be related to an increasingly better definition of the hexagonal corners of the fermi - surface along the @xmath27 , as visible from the comparison of the fermi surface under tensile strain with the equilibrium fermi surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fsstrain]a-[fig : fsstrain]c , center row ) .",
    "this corresponds to a diminished band velocity component in @xmath26-direction , which consequently reduces the respective element of the conductivity tensor . in a simple geometric picture ,",
    "this complies with the decreasing width of the conducting pto@xmath0-layer , while the separation between o and co and thus the width of the insulating layer becomes larger .",
    "recent experiments obtained for the anisotropy @xmath108/@xmath33 of pdcoo@xmath0 values ranging from 150 ( ref .  ) , 280 ( ref .  ) to 400 ( ref .  ) .",

    ", we propose that two different relaxation times must be introduced to describe in - plane and out - of - plane transport appropriately in boltzmann transport theory .",
    "we consider this approach justified in the present case due to the essentially diagonal structure of the transport tensors .",
    "we finally predict that , despite the apparent similarities of both oxides , ptcoo@xmath0 exhibits a much better thermoelectric performance than pdcoo@xmath0 and might thus be a better model system for applications .",
    "our analysis includes the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath5 , which we obtain by combining theoretical results with recently available experimental data for the lattice thermal conductivity of pdcoo@xmath0.@xcite the presence of the topological transition significantly helps in improving this number , since it increases the out - of - plane conductivity , which can be tuned efficiently by an external control parameter , such as epitaxial strain . in this way , we can balance the contributions of electronic and lattice thermal conductivity effectively , while still allowing for sufficiently large absolute values of the thermopower . with this strategy",
    "we arrive at a reasonbale figure of merit of @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 at @xmath8@xmath6@xmath9k in out - of - plane direction for a system under compressive in - plane strain . for tensile strains",
    "the out - of - plane conductivity becomes very low and @xmath5 small , since the lattice thermal conductivity dominates .",
    "but since the thermopower is almost three times larger than for compressive strains , appropriate doping of carriers may still improve the thermoelectric performance reasonably .    in conclusion , the results for ptcoo@xmath0 as a model system confirm that metallic materials characterized by a quasi - twodimensional fermi surface may be well suited for thermolectric applications .",
    "however , we emphasize that for a reasonable performance the two - dimensional shape must not be too perfect . in the present case ,",
