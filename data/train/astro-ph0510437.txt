    "( fig.3 in that paper ) there is significant power at about 10 min .    here",
    "we show that standing acoustic waves oscillating along uniform magnetic field lines effectively generate alfvn waves with double their period and wavelength in the @xmath0 regions of the solar atmosphere .",

    "we consider the small amplitude acoustic waves @xmath70 , so the nonlinear steepening due to the generation of higher harmonics is negligible .",

    "note that the solution has a resonant character within the frequency interval @xmath83    this expression can be rewritten as @xmath84 thus the thickness of the _ swing layer _ depends on the acoustic wave amplitude !    therefore the acoustic oscillations are converted into alfvn waves not only at the surface @xmath85 but also near that region , namely at @xmath86 thus the resonant layer can be significantly wider for stronger amplitude acoustic oscillations .    ]",
    "numerical solution of equations ( 18)-(21 ) ( here the backreaction of alfvn waves is again neglected ) is presented on fig.2 .",
    "the amplification of alfvn waves with double the period of acoustic oscillations is clearly seen .",
    "we suggest that 3 and 5-minute acoustic oscillations in photosphere / chromosphere can be resonantly converted into alfvn waves , or possibly into mhd kink waves in thin photospheric magnetic tubes , this process acting in the region of the solar atmosphere where @xmath87 .",
