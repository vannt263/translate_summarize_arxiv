    "born and infeld proposed their theory for nonlinear electrodynamics ( nle ) in 1934 @xcite with the aim of removing the point charge singularity in classical electrodynamics .",
    "however , soon it became clear that the born - infeld ( bi ) theory works as well as a phenomenological theory of quantum electrodynamics in the first approximation .",
    "the effective action for electrodynamics due to one - loop quantum corrections was calculated by heisenberg and euler @xcite , for the low frequency limit ; the corresponding effective lagrangian have quadratic terms in the electromagnetic field invariants like the bi lagrangian .",
    "moreover , actions of the bi type have recently been the subject of wide interest in relation to the result that the effective action for the open string ending on d - branes can be written in a bi form . in this respect ,",
    "bi cosmological solutions could assist in the understanding of brane dynamics regarding the universe evolution .",
    "these facts make nle particularly interesting in general relativity , specially in cosmological theories , as a simple classical model that incorporates vacuum polarization processes -a possible influence on the mechanism of the evolution of the early universe ; these processes are expressed in terms of a kind of electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum . from this point of view , the exact solutions of einstein - born - infeld ( ebi ) equations are worth to study since they may indicate the physical relevance of nonlinear effects in strong gravitational and strong electromagnetic fields at early epochs of the universe .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it was found that bi cosmological models can be compatible with the recently measured accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "one of the topics of interest is to dilucidate to what extent nle favours or not an inflationary scenario .",
    "the cosmological inflationary scenario , as was proposed by guth @xcite , has been much favoured due to its troubleshooting capabilities .",
    "furthermore , it has recently gained the support of observational evidence @xcite .",
    "the conventional models use some special scalar fields with associated potential to give rise inflation .",
    "another proposal to produce inflation is to use theories with unconventional dependence of the lagrangian on field derivatives @xcite . in this",
    "paper non - linear electrodynamics will be considered as the dynamical field which drives inflation .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no reason to assume that at the onset of inflation the universe was as isotropic as it seems to be today",
    ". it may be precisely an epoch of accelerated expansion that isotropized the universe .",
    "the most simple anisotropic models are the bianchi ones .",

    "an exact solution of the coupled einstein - born - infeld equations for anisotropic cosmological scenario was presented .",
    "later , other cosmological models have been proposed with nonlinear electromagnetic sources : in @xcite it was obtained a homogeneous and isotropic nonsingular friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) solution considering a nonlinear generalization of maxwell electrodynamics as the source ; in @xcite it was investigated a yang - mills cosmology with non - abelian bi action .    here",
    "we present a study of the effects produced by a bi type field in an anisotropic cosmology , based on the analysis of the behavior of the mean hubble parameter and the deceleration as well as the energy conditions .",
    "it turns out that inflation is produced , and in fact , for certain values of the bi parameter , the inflation is enough to provide the desired e - folding number that corresponds to the expansion that solves the cosmological problem of inflation .",
    "the model isotropizes at large times , in such a way that the entry and exit of inflation arise naturally as a consequence of dynamics .",
    "we also present the study of the equations of state of the nonlinear radiation .",

    "@xmath214 dec amounts to    @xmath215    clearly dec is fulfilled if @xmath216 , which in fact is the case we addressed in this work ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the strong energy condition ( sec ) , as stated in @xcite , says : _ a spacetime satisfies the strong energy condition if @xmath217 , for all causal vectors @xmath218_. the same condition is called by hawking as the _ timelike convergence condition _ @xcite .    in the studied case",
    "the traceless ricci tensor @xmath219 has two double repeated eigenvectors such that in the segr classification @xmath219 corresponds to a1[(11)(1,1 ) ] .",
    "actually the two nonvanishing components of the traceless ricci tensor are    @xmath220    for the bi field sec amounts to @xmath221 , which clearly violates sec and the reason is the existence of the negative pressures ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "this fact must not disturb us , since inflationary models driven by scalar inflaton fields violate sec during the inflationary epoch .",
    "the minimally coupled scalar field violates sec and indeed curvature - coupled scalar field theory also violates sec .",
    "this point has been discussed recently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we showed that the born - infeld nonlinear electromagnetic field induces inflation in anisotropic cosmological models that are conformal to several bianchi spaces .",
    "moreover , the e - folding number to obtain enough inflation to solve the horizon and flatness problems can be provided by nonlinear electrodynamics with a fine tunning of the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "note that changing the value of @xmath15 imply physically different nonlinear electrodynamic theories coupled to gravity , since the coupling constant is different .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the kinematical parameters shows that the inflation occurs in a limited period of time and that the model isotropizes , since as the synchronous time goes to infinity the expansion , deceleration and shear tend to vanish .",
    "the analysis of the nonlinear electromagnetic radiation in the anisotropic space exhibites expansion in two directions , associated to negative pressures that could originate condensated states which allow inflation . in the third direction",
    "the equation of state corresponds to stiff matter , this fact could indicate compression in such direction .",
    "we also analyzed the energy conditions and it turned out that the strong energy condition sec is violated by the bi field .",
    "the violation of this condition could has as a consequence the absence of an initial singularity , since the fulfiling of sec is related with the convergence of neighbouring geodesics .",
    "however , in @xcite it was obtained the result that inflationary spacetimes are not past complete , i.e. the corresponding geodesics are incomplete and then a singularity exists . therefore we wonder if this spacetime is singular .",
    "it is work in progress if in the case we addessed the nonlinear electromagnetic field does prevent the existence of an initial singularity .",
    "being the nonlinear electromagnetic field consistent with an inflationary scenario , it might be that the bi field or another field with a lagrangian of this type was present at early epochs of the universe , probably not alone , but accompanied with some scalar fields and that together , in a kind of  assisted inflation \" , cooperate to produce the appropriate initial conditions for a frw - type universe .",
    "however to address the standard picture of inflation the question arises on how can we consider quantum fluctuations of the bi field during inflation ? , since in fact bi theory corresponds to an effective modification induced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "also we must investigate if within the bi theory is it possible to have reheating in the universe ; this lead us to the question of creation of particles and quantization of the bi field ; this study was initiated by born and infeld themselves in 1935 and they showed that the commutation rules for the field components were very similar to the ones of quantum mechanics .",
    "alternatively , one could adopt a squeme like the proposed in higher - derivative gravity theories and to look for a conformal equivalence between bi field coupled to gravity on one side and the einstein theory with a scalar field on the other side , and then proceed as in the standard inflationary treatments .",
    "all these are speculations that have to be worked out .",
