    "at present , there are several challenges to be faced in the investigation of the implications of superstring theory for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a primary obstacle is the degeneracy of string vacua ; a large number of string models have been constructed , with as yet no fully realistic model .",
    "there is also no satisfactory scenario for supersymmetry breaking in string theory either at the level of the world - sheet dynamics or at the level of the effective theory , and hence no way to break supersymmetry in string models without introducing new parameters .",
    "both issues are hoped to have a resolution with greater understanding of nonperturbative string dynamics .",
    "our strategy is to take a more modest view by restricting our consideration to a class of string models of perturbative heterotic string vacua  @xcite which have the ingredients of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and thus the potential to be realistic .",
    "such quasi - realistic models have been constructed in a weakly coupled heterotic superstring theory in a variety of constructions  @xcite .",
    "we consider a class of free fermionic models  @xcite which have @xmath10 supersymmetry , the sm gauge group as a part of the gauge structure , and candidate fields for the three generations of quarks and leptons as well as two electroweak higgs doublets .",
    "these models also possess gauge coupling unification at @xmath11 gev  @xcite without a gauge group unification ; this scale differs by an order of magnitude from the unification scale obtained by extrapolating from the observed low - energy values of the gauge couplings assuming the minimal particle content of the mssm .",
    "( for a review of the properties of string models , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . )",
    "this class of models share a number of generic features .",
    "their gauge structures contain at tree level an additional non - abelian  hidden \" sector gauge group as well as a number of abelian gauge groups , one of them generically anomalous .",
    "the sm hypercharge is determined as a linear combination of the non - anomalous @xmath12 s of the model ( or perhaps of the @xmath12 s that arise when the hidden sector gauge group is broken ) .",
    "in addition to the mssm fields , the particle content typically includes a number of fields which are nontrivial representations under the sm ( observable sector ) gauge group or the non - abelian hidden sector gauge group ( or both ) , as well as a number of non - abelian singlet fields .",
    "most of the fields of a given model are charged under the @xmath12 gauge groups , such that in general there is no distinct separation between the observable and hidden sector gauge groups .    in this class of models ,",
    "the couplings are calculable in string theory ; techniques have been developed to calculate the superpotential  @xcite in principle to all orders in the nonrenormalizable terms .",
    "one generic feature of the superpotentials is that additional worldsheet selection rules forbid terms otherwise allowed by gauge invariance .",
    "however , the determination of the khler potential is more involved in part because the khler potential is not protected by supersymmetric non - renormalization theorems and thus receives corrections at all orders in the string loop expansion .",
    "therefore , in the analysis that follows we assume a minimal khler potential , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the analysis of this class of quasi - realistic models proceeds in several stages .",
    "the first step is to address the presence of the anomalous @xmath12 in the model .",
    "the underlying superstring theory is anomaly - free , and hence there is a standard mechanism in the four - dimensional effective theory in which the axion - dilaton supermultiplet shifts under @xmath13 in such a way that all triangle anomalies are cancelled .",
    "the anomaly cancellation mechanism generates a nonzero fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) contribution to the @xmath0- term of the anomalous @xmath12 at higher genus in string theory  @xcite .",
    "the fi term would break supersymmetry in the original string vacuum , but certain scalar fields are triggered to acquire large vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) along @xmath0- and @xmath1- flat directions  @xcite .",
    "the new  restabilized \" vacuum is supersymmetric , with a gauge structure of reduced rank ( in particular , the anomalous @xmath12 is broken ) , and a reduced number of massless fields , as the fields which couple to the fields in the flat direction can acquire string - scale masses and decouple from the theory . therefore , an analysis of the @xmath0- and @xmath1- flat directions is the necessary first step in the investigation of the phenomenology of the string model .",
    "( issues of anomalous @xmath12 in string models and string ( motivated ) models were discussed in  @xcite . )    in a previous paper  @xcite , we developed techniques to classify the flat directions of a general perturbative heterotic superstring model with an anomalous @xmath12 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we chose to consider flat directions formed of non - abelian singlets only , and selected the singlet fields with zero hypercharge to preserve the sm gauge group .",
    "our method involves classifying the fields according to their anomalous charge to see if flat directions that can cancel the fi term can be formed .",
    "if such flat directions can be formed , we construct the superbasis of all one - dimensional ( i.e. , that depend on one free vev before imposing the anomalous @xmath0 term constraint ) @xmath0- flat directions under the non - anomalous @xmath12 s .",
    "the elements of the superbasis with the appropriate sign of the anomalous charge to cancel the fi term are the building blocks of the @xmath14- flat directions of the model .",
    "for a subset of these @xmath0- flat directions , the requirements of gauge invariance as well as a string calculation of the superpotential to a given order suffice to prove @xmath1- flatness to all orders in the nonrenormalizable superpotential .",
    "our method provides a systematic and complete classification of the subset of the @xmath0- flat directions which can be proven to be @xmath1- flat to all orders .",
    "each of these flat directions corresponds to a new restabilized string vacuum of a given model .",
    "we applied our method to a prototype string model , model 5 of  @xcite ( chl5 ) , in  @xcite , and more recently to a number of free fermionic string models in  @xcite .",
    "the next stage of the analysis of this class of string models is to investigate the implications of each flat direction of a given model . in general ,",
    "a number of @xmath12 s are broken in each flat direction , though we find that usually at least one @xmath12 in addition to @xmath15 remains unbroken .",
    "the couplings of the fields in the flat direction to the other fields in the model lead to the generation of effective mass terms , such that some of the fields acquire superheavy masses and decouple from the theory .",
    "effective trilinear couplings are also induced from higher - dimensional terms for the remaining light states , with implications for the phenomenology of the model .",
    "effective nonrenormalizable terms are also generated  .",
    "we have developed techniques to determine the effective bilinear and trilinear couplings to all orders in the fields with nonzero vev s along a particular flat direction .",
    "once these terms are determined , they are exact to all orders in the string genus expansion  @xcite .",
    "the details of the effective superpotential strongly depend on the flat direction under consideration .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a class of the flat directions obtained in  @xcite for the prototype string model ( model 5 in  @xcite ( chl5 ) ) , and investigate the implications of the mass spectrum and effective trilinear couplings .",
    "we choose to consider flat directions with the maximal number of fields , which also break the maximal number of @xmath12 s ; in these directions , one @xmath2 is unbroken in addition to @xmath15 .",
    "we generalize our techniques developed to prove @xmath1- flatness to determine the effective renormalizable superpotential :    * * massless spectrum . * for each flat direction , we determine the complete massless spectrum ( at the string scale ) .",
    "we find that the flat directions considered share the undesirable feature that along with the mssm content there are additional massless exotics .",
    "for the cases in which the @xmath2 is broken at the electroweak scale , the exotic fermions remain light compared to the electroweak scale , which is excluded by experiment .",
    "this feature indicates a general flaw of this type of models . *",
    "* trilinear terms .",
    "* nevertheless , we proceed and analyze the effective trilinear couplings . for each flat direction",
    "we determine all such couplings ( to all orders in the vev s of fields in the flat direction ) in the observable sector of the theory , i.e. , the sm and @xmath2 sector of the theory .",
    "( in addition we include terms involving the hidden sector fields that play a role in the renormalization group analysis of the symmetry breaking scenarios , a topic of a subsequent paper  @xcite . )",
    "we then discuss the implications of these couplings .",
    "the predictions ( from @xmath16 ) for the electroweak gauge couplings are presented . at the level of the trilinear superpotential",
    ", we consider the fermion masses and textures ; baryon- and lepton - number violating couplings ; @xmath3-parity breaking terms and the absence of a stable lsp ; and the occurrence of the non - canonical ( `` half '' ) @xmath4- term .",
    "we identify types of symmetry breaking scenarios for @xmath2 , one at the electroweak scale  @xcite and another one at an intermediate scale  @xcite ; and discuss the family non - universality of @xmath17 couplings . while we calculated the mass spectrum and the effective trilinear terms ( in the observable sector ) for all the flat directions ( classified in  @xcite ) , in the paper we illustrate the techniques and present the detailed analysis along the steps discussed above for _ two representative flat directions_.    in the subsequent paper  @xcite we plan to carry out further the phenomenological consequences by introducing soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters ; we shall analyze specific sm and @xmath2 symmetry breaking patterns , consistent with experiment , and the particle mass spectrum at the electroweak scale .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ ii ] , we review the flat direction analysis for this model given in @xcite , and present our techniques to compute the effective renormalizable superpotential for each flat direction considered . in sections  [ iii ] and  [ iv ]",

    "conclusions and a discussion of further investigations are given in section  [ v ] .",
    "the model we choose to analyze is model 5 of @xcite ( chl5 ) , which has the gauge group @xmath18 in addition to the mssm fields , the particle content includes the additional chiral superfields : @xmath19 where the representation under @xmath20 is indicated .",

    "we require three families of quarks and leptons , as well as at least two candidate electroweak higgs doublets , with conventional hypercharges .",
    "we also require grouping of all fields which are charged under @xmath28 and/or transform under @xmath29 into mirror pairs ; this is a prerequisite to have a possibility of avoiding exactly massless charged and/or colored particles in the theory . in this model , these criteria lead to the unique hypercharge definition ( first presented in @xcite ) : [ hyp ] y=(-8q_2 - 3q_3 - 8q_4-q_5+q_6 ) , , with ka - moody level @xmath30.(we calculate @xmath31 using the universal green - schwarz relations ; for more details , see @xcite . )      the presence of the anomalous @xmath12 leads to the generation of a nonzero fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term @xmath32 in the corresponding @xmath0- term at genus - one  @xcite ( at genus two for the dilaton tadpole  @xcite ) in string theory with @xmath33 in which @xmath34 is related to the gauge coupling @xmath7 by the relation @xmath35",

    "the fi @xmath0- term triggers the scalar components @xmath41 of certain chiral superfields @xmath42 to acquire vev s in such a way that @xmath0- and @xmath1- flatness conditions are satisfied  @xcite . in principle , the fields which acquire vev s may be those with nontrivial representations under the observable sector or the non - abelian hidden sector . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict our consideration to the non - abelian singlet fields of the model , and select only those fields with zero hypercharge to preserve the sm gauge group at the string scale .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath1- flatness conditions for these fields are given by @xmath43 we list the non - abelian singlets of the model with their @xmath12 charges in table i.    in a previous paper @xcite , we presented techniques to classify the @xmath0- and @xmath1- flat directions of a general perturbative heterotic string model with an anomalous @xmath12 , and illustrated the method by applying it to this model .",
    "we summarize the method and repeat the conclusions here for the sake of completeness , and refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "first , the @xmath0- flat directions associated with the non - anomalous @xmath12 s are determined , by making use of the one - to - one correspondence of @xmath0- flat directions with holomorphic gauge - invariant monomials ( him s ) of chiral superfields  @xcite , constructed from the non - abelian singlets .",
    "we construct the set of all one - dimensional him s , which we refer to as the superbasis .",
    "the complete set of @xmath0-flat directions under the non - anomalous @xmath12 s can be obtained by multiplying the elements of the superbasis .",
    "the elements of the superbasis with anomalous charge opposite in sign to the fi term @xmath32 are flat with respect to the @xmath0- term of the anomalous @xmath12 .",
    "this subset of the superbasis elements , which we denote as @xmath44 , are the building blocks for the @xmath0- flat directions of the model .",
    "we presented the superbasis in @xcite , and showed that there are five such classes of @xmath14- flat elements : [ pis ] p_1&=&_28 , _",

    ", one should add similar monomials obtained by replacing some field by its copy ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "therefore , every @xmath14- flat direction can be obtained from the set @xmath44 by p = p_n , with @xmath50 some him ( not necessarily with @xmath51 ) .    to address the @xmath1- flatness of the @xmath0- flat directions",
    ", we note that there are two classes of terms in the superpotential that can lift a general @xmath0- flat direction @xmath52 .",
    "first , there can be terms which are formed only of the fields in the flat direction @xmath52 : [ wa ] w_a~(_ip _ i)^n , in which the coefficients ( which depend on inverse powers of @xmath53 ) are not displayed explicitly .",
    "the flat direction @xmath52 will be said to be type - a if such an invariant is allowed by gauge symmetries .",
    "if such an invariant exists , there are an infinite number of terms which can lift the flat direction , because this invariant can appear to any power in the superpotential .",
    "the type - a directions will remain @xmath1- flat only if string selection rules ( e.g. @xmath3 parities ) conspire to forbid the infinite number of @xmath54 terms , which is difficult to prove in general .",
    "the other class of terms are of the form [ wb ] w_b~(_ip _ i ) , with @xmath55 .",
    "a flat direction will be denoted as type - b if gauge invariance only allows @xmath56 terms .",
    "in contrast to the case with the @xmath54 terms , gauge invariance constrains the number of @xmath56 terms which can exist to a finite number . by doing a string calculation of the superpotential to a finite order",
    ", the presence of these terms can be checked explicitly , and if such terms are absent the flat direction is proved to be @xmath1- flat to all orders in the nonrenormalizable superpotential .",
    "we take a conservative approach by restricting our consideration to the type - b directions which can be proved to be @xmath1- flat to all orders . in doing so ,",
    "we are of course neglecting certain type - a directions that may be @xmath1- flat due to `` string selection - rules '' of the model .",
    "it is straightforward to show  @xcite that type - b directions are formed only from carefully combining the @xmath57 s . in this model",
    ", we found that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are not @xmath1- flat , and thus the @xmath1- flat directions are formed from @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( and the primed versions of them involving copies of the fields ) .",
    "we present the complete list of @xmath1- flat directions in table ii .",
    "this table demonstrates that there are a range of flat directions , which break different numbers of the non - anomalous @xmath12 s .",
    "we choose to analyze the @xmath63 and @xmath64 flat directions , which break the maximum number of @xmath12 s ; these directions all leave an additional @xmath2 as well as @xmath15 unbroken .",
    "the unbroken @xmath2 is given by y=(-130q_2 - 14q_3 + 148q_4 - 51q_5 + 51q_6 ) , [ u1p ] with @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath0- term constraints for the vev s of the fields in the most general @xmath64 direction yield the relations [ vevs ]    lcl |_27|^2=2x^2 , & & |_28(29)|^2=x^2-|_1|^2 , +         with [ xdef ] x^2=- . in this model @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 are free vev s of the moduli space , subject to the restrictions that [ restrict ] x^2|_1|^2|_2|^2 , to ensure the positivity of the vev - squares .",
    "simpler flat directions are recovered by setting the free vev s to particular values ; for example , setting @xmath69 yields the solution for the vev s of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , there can be an enhanced number of @xmath12 s at particular points in the moduli space .",
    "the @xmath63 directions are obtained by setting @xmath70 , which gives @xmath71 .    in some cases ,",
    "a judicious choice of the copies of the fields allows for @xmath1- flatness without imposing any constraints on the free vev s .",
    "however , other possible flat directions can be formed by imposing constraints on the free vev s in such a way as to cancel contributions from different @xmath1- terms , i.e. , of the type @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "for example , the directions denoted by @xmath73 are obtained by imposing @xmath74 , and @xmath75 phase difference between vev s of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 terms  @xcite  .",
    "the complete list of all such flat directions is given in table ii .",
    "for each flat direction , effective mass terms for fields @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) may be generated by the coupling of these fields to the fields @xmath42 in the flat direction , such that @xmath81 the fields with effective mass terms will acquire @xmath1-term string - scale masses and decouple from the low - energy theory . in cases in which @xmath1-flatness occurs via cancellations , other fields coupled linearly to the flat directions fields also get heavy masses ( we will later study such a case ) .",
    "in addition to these large masses induced by @xmath1-terms , @xmath0-terms can also make some ( combination ) of the fields related to the flat direction heavy ( all other fields do not feel the presence of large vevs in the @xmath0-terms because of the @xmath0-flatness conditions ) .",
    "particular combinations of the real components of the fields entering the flat direction gain a mass of order @xmath82 ( through @xmath0- terms ) and become degenerate with the massive @xmath12 gauge bosons , completing , along with a dirac fermion ( a neutralino ) , a massive vector multiplet .",
    "this is guaranteed by the fact that supersymmetry remains unbroken in the restabilized vacuum , so that the spectrum must arrange itself in supersymmetric multiplets , the squared - mass matrix of @xmath12 gauge bosons is @xmath83 while that of real scalars , coming from @xmath0-terms is @xmath84 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are equal and in exact one - to - one correspondence .",
    "the presence of non - zero @xmath1-term scalar masses does not spoil this correspondence when @xmath85 : they simply give mass to zero - eigenvalues of @xmath84 . ] .",
    "the imaginary parts of these fields become the longitudinal components of the massive @xmath12 gauge bosons .",
    "( this scenario thus exhibits all the features of the higgs mechanism in @xmath10 supersymmetric theory . )    for directions which are flat due to cancellations of @xmath1- term contributions , some ( complex ) fields in the flat direction get masses of order `` [ yukawa ] @xmath86 [ field vev ] '' and form , along with its superpartner , a massive chiral superfield .",
    "( as mentioned above , the fields with zero vev s which couple linearly in these terms also acquire mass of the same order . )",
    "remaining fields in the flat direction , including the real parts of the fields whose vev is not fixed by the flatness conditions , as well as imaginary parts not removed by the higgs mechanism , will stay massless and will appear in the low energy theory as massless chiral superfields ( moduli ) .    for the flat directions of the type @xmath87 , which has all the vev s fixed , all these ( six ) fields are heavy .",
    "namely , the higgs mechanism ensures that five imaginary components are goldstone bosons giving mass to the gauge bosons of five ( including anomalous ) @xmath12 s , and the accompanying five real components get mass , thus completing five massive vector supermultiplets .",
    "the remaining complex field gets a mass from the superpotential terms of the type @xmath88 , i.e. , the terms which require additional constraints on the vev s in order to ensure @xmath1- flatness .",
    "note that due to these terms @xmath89 also acquires a mass .    for the flat directions of the type @xmath64 ,",
    "there are two free vev parameters ,",
    "since now an additional field participates in the vacuum restabilization and there are no constraints on the vev s from @xmath1- flatness constraints ( as opposed to the @xmath90 flat directions ) , and the corresponding analysis shows that now there are two massless complex fields , which act as moduli in the space of restabilized vacua .",
    "the spectrum of the low - energy theory not only arranges itself in susy multiplets , but also , the interactions of the light particles can be described by an effective superpotential which contains only the light degrees of freedom .",
    "( the moduli fields associated with the flat direction in question are absent from this superpotential . ) in addition to the trilinear couplings of the original superpotential , effective renormalizable interactions for the light fields may also be generated via @xmath91 in principle , effective nonrenormalizable terms at each order will also be generated from higher - order nonrenormalizable terms in the superpotential in this way .",
    "however , there are many other sources for effective nonrenormalizable terms ( such as via the decoupling of the heavy fields  @xcite ) which are competitive in strength .",
    "a complete classification of the effective nonrenormalizable terms is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the method for determining the effective mass terms and trilinear interactions for each flat direction is similar to the strategy for determining the @xmath56 terms in the superpotential when testing for @xmath1- flatness .",
    "first , we construct all the bilinear and trilinear terms which are gauge invariant under the unbroken gauge group of the model after the vacuum restabilization ( for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 directions , this includes @xmath15 and @xmath2 as well as the non - abelian gauge groups ) .",
    "we then treat each term as a composite field , and construct all possible terms that are gauge invariant under all of the @xmath12 s in the theory ( including the anomalous @xmath12 ) which involve the fields in the flat direction and are linear in the composite field .",
    "the next step is to calculate explicitly whether each gauge invariant term is present in the superpotential , or forbidden by string selection rules . in practice ,",
    "the requirements of gauge invariance give the order to which the superpotential must be calculated to determine the full effective renormalizable superpotential .",
    "once the mass terms are determined , it is straightforward to determine the complete mass spectrum of the model .",
    "the trilinear interaction terms are then written in terms of the mass eigenstates , so that the decoupling theorem can be applied to the terms involving the superheavy fields .    in free fermionic constructions the elementary trilinear superpotential terms",
    "have coupling strengths @xmath92 : the typical value is given by @xmath93 , where again @xmath7 is the gauge coupling .",
    "however , the introduction of the `` ising worldsheet fields '' in more involved constructions ( e.g. , in  @xcite ) , allows also for yukawa couplings @xmath8 and @xmath94  @xcite . in general , the coefficients @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) of the nonrenormalizable superpotential terms of order @xmath97 are given by the relation : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the inverse string tension , @xmath100 is a coefficient of @xmath101 which includes different renormalization factors in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the string vertex operators ( including the target space gauge group clebsch - gordan coefficients ) , and @xmath102 is a world - sheet integral .",
    "the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 have been computed numerically by several authors  @xcite with the typical values that are in the range @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "( see  @xcite where special attention is paid to restoring the correct factors and units . )",
    "the coefficients of the effective trilinear terms are then given by @xmath107 .",
    "using @xmath108 as the typical scale of the vev s , we find that the terms from the fourth order have effective yukawa coupling strengths @xmath109 , while the fifth order terms have coupling strengths @xmath110 .",
    "( we took @xmath111 , since this is the value typically obtained for the model discussed . ) therefore , compared to the typical elementary trilinear term @xmath111 the fourth order terms are competitive in strength to the trilinear terms of the original superpotential , while the higher order contributions are suppressed .",
    "of course , the precise values for each term will depend on the particular fields involved . in particular , the coupling strengths can depend on the free vev s of the flat direction , and hence are parameters that can be varied in the analysis of the model .",
    "the structure of the effective trilinear couplings strongly depends on the flat direction under consideration .",
    "we have determined the mass spectrum and the effective trilinear superpotential terms ( in the observable sector ) for the directions classified in table ii  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the details of the two flat directions , @xmath112 and @xmath87 , as representative examples .",
    "these directions encompass general features of the whole class of flat directions ( table ii ) and demonstrate the nature of the massless spectrum and its phenomenological implications .",
    "the first flat direction is `` minimal '' in the sense that there are a minimal number of surviving trilinear couplings of the massless observable sector .",
    "the second one has a richer structure of such couplings , with implications for , e.g. , the fermion texture , and baryon and lepton violating processes .",
    "this flat direction involves the set of fields @xmath113 ( see table  ii ) .",
    "the vev s for the fields correspond to the most general case given in ( [ vevs ] ) , such that they depend on two free parameters ( that are constrained to be bounded from above by the value of the fi term as dictated by eq . ( [ restrict ] ) ) .",
    "the effective mass terms are computed for this flat direction using the techniques described in the previous section , with the result  :    @xmath114    the coefficients of the elementary trilinear terms , equal to @xmath7 or @xmath8 , are displayed explicitly .",
    "it is straightforward to determine the mass eigenstates , and we list the massive and massless states in table iii .",
    "( the mass spectrum of fields with non - zero vev s in the flat directions were discussed in section iia and are not explicitly displayed in the tables . )",

    "the texture is induced at a higher order  however , only in the down quark- sector , and only certain entries arising at a specific order ( e.g , for the second example , at the fifth order ) .",

    "@xmath4 parameter .",
    "_ in principle , there is a possibility of having a standard effective @xmath4-term at the electroweak scale , due to the trilinear couplings of the two standard higgs doublets ( which respectively couple to the @xmath270- and @xmath168- quarks ) to the sm singlet(s ) which acquire non - zero vev s at the electroweak scale ( and , if they are charged under the additional @xmath2 , give mass to the @xmath17 ) .",
    "it turns out that there is no such canonical @xmath4-term in these examples . however , there are `` non - canonical '' @xmath4-terms that involve a standard higgs doublet with a coupling to the @xmath270-quark and another higgs field ( that may couple to the @xmath271- or @xmath23-quark at high orders )",
    ". this non - canonical @xmath4-parameter has interesting implications for the neutralino and chargino sector mass patterns .",
    "+ _ baryon and lepton - number violating couplings . _ in general such couplings",
    "are present ; they may induce proton decay , @xmath9 oscillations and/or leptoquark couplings and break @xmath3-parity , so that there is no stable lsp . for specific directions such couplings are absent or",
    "could be suppressed within a specific sm symmetry breaking scenario . *",
    "* the @xmath2 symmetry breaking pattern * can be either at an intermediate or at the electroweak scale .",
    "it depends on the @xmath2 charges and the type of trilinear couplings of the massless sm singlets .",
    "e.g. , for the first representative direction all the @xmath2 charges of the massless sm singlets have the same sign ; thus , there is no @xmath0-flat @xmath2 direction , and the breaking necessarily takes place at the electroweak scale .",
    "the particular values of the @xmath2 charges for the light particle spectrum ( which are family non - universal ) , imply new experimental constraints on this @xmath17 . on the other hand , in the second example",
    "there is an additional massless sm singlet with the opposite sign of @xmath2 charge from the other singlets , and @xmath1-flat @xmath2-directions for the trilinear couplings , and thus the symmetry breaking can take place at an intermediate scale .",
    "it turns out to be purely radiative in origin , because of the absence of the relevant nonrenormalizable terms in the superpotential .",
    "further specific properties of the symmetry breaking patterns , and the corresponding mass spectrum at the electroweak scale , depend on the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms introduced by hand at the string scale . specific examples with a realistic electroweak sm and @xmath2 breaking pattern , will be investigated in @xcite .",
    "while the trilinear couplings in the hidden sector were not explored to all orders in the vev s of the fields in a particular flat direction , the terms at the third and fourth order are known  @xcite .",
    "( terms at higher orders are suppressed . )",
    "further investigation of the implications of the hidden sector is underway .",
    "the work presented in this paper opens a number of further avenues for investigation .",
    "specifically , the study of non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential is needed . in this case",
    "the investigation is complicated by the fact that along with the direct determination of the non - renormalizable terms in string theory there are additional induced terms due to the decoupling effects of the fields that became heavy after vacuum restabilization .",
    "( for detailed investigation of these decoupling effects see @xcite . )",
    "further study of the corrections to the k \" ahler potential after vacuum restabilization is also needed .",
    "these effects may have further implications for the mass spectrum in the intermediate scale @xmath2 breaking scenarios .",
    "in particular , a number of exotic fields could acquire mass at a scale larger than the electroweak one .",
    "in addition , additional entries in the fermion textures can appear and effective @xmath4 term can be generated  @xcite .    the techniques for systematic classification of @xmath0- and @xmath1- flat directions @xcite for perturbative heterotic string vacua with anomalous @xmath2 and the subsequent determination of the mass spectrum and coupling of the restabilized vacua , as investigated in this paper , is general , and can be applied immediately to the study of other quasi - realistic models , which is also underway .",
    "these techniques may also be applied to the study of _ non - perturbative _",
    "heterotic string vacua with anomalous @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the models discussed in this paper are not fully realistic , and contain such features as very light or massless exotic fermions , charginos , and neutralinos , an unwanted @xmath6 universality and undesirable ratio of the @xmath168- and @xmath145 string scale yukawa couplings , unrealistic fermion textures , and possible proton decay , etc .",
    "however , they also contain at least the gauge structure and particle content of the mssm , and illustrate a number of features of this class of string models that are likely to be present in many other string models , including nonperturbative ones .",
    "these include additional @xmath17 bosons , which may have family - nonuniversal couplings and which may have masses either at the electroweak scale or an intermediate scale ; exotic fermions and their scalar partners ; approximate gauge unification ; the possibility of effective non - standard @xmath4 terms ; an extended neutralino / chargino spectrum ; the possibility of baryon and/or lepton number violation ; and @xmath3-parity violation , leading to the absence of a stable lsp , leptoquark couplings , and non - standard chargino / neutralino decays .",
