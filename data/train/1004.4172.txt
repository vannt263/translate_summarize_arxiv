    "a product of trees gives a higher dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex , and by the hurewicz theorem for asymptotic dimension @xcite , one again has that the asymptotic dimension is bounded above by the dimension of the cube complex . in this paper , we show that this holds in full generality . note that we do not require the cube complex to be locally finite .",
    "this paper extends the result of @xcite , where it is shown that finite dimensional cat(0 ) cube complexes have property a. it also extends the result of @xcite where it is shown that the asymptotic dimension of a right - angled coxeter group does not exceed the dimension of its davis complex .",
    "the study of asymptotic dimension for cube complexes is motivated in part by the example of thompson s group @xmath1 .",

    "thompson s group acts on an infinite dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex ( see @xcite ) with the property that the dimension of the cubes increases polynomially with the distance from an orbit . in establishing bounds on the asymptotic dimension of cat(0 ) cube complexes we provide a first step in proving the exactness of thompson s group .",

    "the strategy is to construct a lipschitz map from a cat(0 ) cube complex @xmath2 into a quotient complex @xmath13 , with lipschitz constant strictly less than one . by iterating the process",
    "we obtain arbitrarily contractive maps into a cube complex of dimension no greater than @xmath2 , thus obtaining a bound on the asymptotic dimension .    in section [ sec : colouring ]",
    "we introduce the concept of controlled colourings on the set of hyperplanes ; these are used in section [ sec : interp ] to produce the quotient complex @xmath13 .",
    "the main result of section [ sec : colouring ] is an existence theorem for controlled colourings . in section [ sec : projection ] we prove a projection theorem .",
    "specifically we prove that every cat(0 ) cube complex is a contractive retraction of an infinite dimensional cube . the retraction is constructed as an infinite composition of functions , and we give hypotheses under which a general infinite composition is well - defined . in section [ sec : interp ] we use the controlled colouring to construct a large - scale contractive map from a cat(0 ) cube complex @xmath2 into a quotient @xmath13 .",
    "this map is 1-lipschitz on small scales , and to complete the proof we carry out an interpolation argument , using the projection theorem from section [ sec : projection ] , to produce a map with lipschitz constant strictly less than 1 .",
