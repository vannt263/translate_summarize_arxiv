    "the shell - model or independent particle model ( ipm ) has been very successful in describing basic features of nuclear systems .",
    "this means that nuclei are considered as a system of nucleons moving independently in a mean field and the residual interaction between these particle or quasiparticles is supposed to be weak .",
    "therefore the response of the the system to an external perturbation can be calculated within the fermi liquid theory @xcite in terms of linear response functions .",
    "these response functions are calculated assuming a hartree - fock ( hf ) propagator for the particle - hole excitations of the nucleons and including the residual interaction by means of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) approximation . in the long - wavelength limit or external perturbations with low momentum transfer , the residual interaction between the quasiparticles is usually parameterized in terms of landau parameters .",
    "this hf plus rpa scheme is typically used to determine e.g. the neutrino propagator in hot and dense nuclear matter @xcite and it has been found that the neutrino opacity is very sensitive to the details of these response functions .",
    "this quantity is very crucial for the simulation of astrophysical objects like the explosion of supernovae or the cooling mechanism for neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the study of the response is also very important to determine the propagator of mesons or a photon in the nuclear medium .",
    "therefore such investigations have to be performed to explore e.g. the possibility for a pion condensation@xcite or the production and emission of mesons and photons from the hot dense matter obtained in heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "last not least the response function is also reflecting the excitation modes of nuclei .",
    "however , the simple hf plus rpa scheme outlined above is applicable to nuclear systems only if effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions like skyrme@xcite or gogny@xcite forces are employed .",
    "the ipm fails completely if realistic nn interactions are considered , which have been adjusted to describe the nn scattering data .",
    "trying to evaluate the energy of nuclear matter from such realistic interaction within the hf approximation yields positive energies , i.e. unbound nuclei@xcite .",
    "the reason of this deficiency of the hf approximation in nuclear physics are the correlations beyond the ipm approach , which are induced from the strong short - range and tensor components of a realistic nn interaction .",
    "these correlations have a significant effect on the single - particle propagator for a nucleon in the nuclear medium .",
    "the spectral function still exhibits a quasiparticle peak .",
    "a sizable fraction , however , of the strength occurs at energies above and below the quasiparticle peak . for hole - states one",
    "typically observes that around 15 % of the spectral strength is shifted to energies above the fermi energy @xcite which means that the occupation probability of those states is reduced from 100 % in the case of the ipm approach to around 85 % .",
    "another fraction of the hole - strength is shifted to energies below the quasiparticle energies , which means that it should be found in nucleon knock - out experiments at large missing energies .",
    "these effects of correlations on the spectral distribution are confirmed in ( @xmath0 ) experiments ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    in lowest order",
    "this redistribution of the strength in the single - particle spectral function is due to the admixture of two - hole one - particle and two - particle one - hole contributions to the propagator in the hf field",
    ". therefore one may feel the temptation to use these correlated propagators and evaluate the nuclear response function in terms of these dressed propagators . in this way one",
    "is including two - particle two - hole admixtures to the particle - hole response function . as we can expect from the discussion above and as we will see below , such a procedure leads to response functions which",
    ", comparing to the hf plus rpa response , exhibit a significant shift of the excitation strength to larger energies .",
    "we will also see , however , that such a significant shift of the excitation strength , can in general not be consistent with the energy weighted sum - rules , which are observed in the hf plus rpa scheme .",
    "it is well known that it is rather difficult to develop a symmetry conserving approach for the evaluation of green s functions which accounts for correlations beyond the hf plus rpa approximation . in the case of the response function",
    "this requires a consistent treatment of propagator and vertex corrections . in this manuscript",
    "we will follow the general recipe of baym and kadanoff@xcite for calculating the in - medium coupling of an external perturbation to dressed nucleons in a self - consistent way .",
    "this procedure leads to an integral equation , a bethe - salpeter equation for the dressed vertex .",
    "the in - medium vertex has the structure of a three - point green s functions . for dressed ( off - shell ) nucleons",
    "it is a function of two momenta and two energies . since",
    "such calculations are rather involved , only a few exist for the density response function @xcite . in order to make these calculation feasible",
    ", we define a simple interaction model . the nucleons are dressed by a mean - field and a residual interaction .",
    "the residual interaction is taken selfconsistently to the second order .",
    "the parameters of the interaction are adjusted to reproduce the main features of single - particle spectral functions derived from realistic nn interactions .    after this introduction we present in section 2 our interaction model and the adjustment of its parameters to reproduce the nucleon self - energy derived from a realistic interaction .",
    "the evaluation of the response functions with a consistent treatment of propagator and vertex corrections is outlined in section 3 .",
    "numerical results for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are presented in section 4 . there",
    "we also discuss the effect of multi - pair contributions to the response functions at high excitation energies and its relation to the spin - isospin structure of the residual interaction and the consequences for the damping of collective modes .",
    "the final section summarizes the main conclusions of this study .",
    "calculations of the response function in nuclear matter are usually restricted to the hf plus rpa approximation , employing parameterizations of the effective nn interaction . there",
    "exist many relatively simple and successful parameterization of the mean - field hamiltonian for nuclear systems , e.g. the skyrme interaction @xcite and the gogny interaction @xcite .",
    "usually such effective interactions include spin and isospin dependent terms , and also density dependent terms .",
    "the skyrme interaction is a zero range interaction with velocity dependent terms , for which a complete calculation of the rpa response is possible @xcite . in general",
    ", however , the calculation of the rpa response requires the consideration of a nontrivial sum of exchange terms@xcite , which are often approximated .",
    "usually the response function for finite range interactions is calculated expanding the interaction in landau parameters @xcite .    in this study",
    "we want to analyze the linear response functions in a fermionic systems when the correlations of the system that we take into account go beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "we suppose that the interactions between the nucleons are given by a mean - field potential and a residual interaction .",
    "the mean - field interaction that we take is based on the gogny parameterization @xmath1 the first term is a sum of two gaussians giving a finite range interaction and the second term is a sum of two zero - range density dependent interactions @xcite , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the residual interaction is taken in a very simple form @xcite @xmath4 with the parameters @xmath5mev , @xmath6fm .",
    "the single particle propagator is calculated by taking the mean field contributions only for the gogny interaction ( [ vgogny ] ) and the second order direct born term for the residual interaction ( [ vres ] ) .",

    "the width obtained from a self - consistent calculation in the second order of the residual interaction is similar to the result obtained from a self - consistent @xmath15-matrix calculation using realistic bare nucleon - nucleon interaction ( fig .",
    "[ szer ] ) .",

    "( [ dispself ] ) .",
    "this means that the real part of the self - energy at the quasiparticle pole @xmath17 is different from the gogny single - particle potential .",

    "in this section we discuss the linear response of a correlated system to an external perturbation . as it has already been mentioned above the evaluation of the rpa response function requires for a general interaction a solution of a bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation with a non - trivial kernel which is due to the exchange terms in the nn interaction .",
    "therefore one often simplifies the solution of the bs equation by a parameterization of the particle - hole interaction in terms of landau parameters .",

    "[ bsfig ] .    as mentioned before the kernel of this bs equation has contributions from the mean - field and from the residual interaction . in this work",
    "we are interested in the role of the correlations going beyond the mean - field , which are described by means of the residual interaction discussed above .",
    "therefore we will also consider the effects which are due to the mean field and the residual interactions in the kernel of the bethe - salpeter in separate steps . in a first step",

    "e.g. for the density response function we have @xmath51 and analogously for other channels .",
    "the landau parameters are calculated using the modified gogny mean - field with parameters from table [ table ] .",
    "there is little change of these parameters when comparing with the landau parameters obtained from the original gogny interaction . only in the scalar channel",

    "so we now turn to the effects of the residual interaction in the response function . in the real - time representation",
    "the bethe - salpeter equations including only the residual interaction in the kernel take the form @xmath52 and @xmath53 the terms in these equations containing the one - loop polarization function @xmath54 or @xmath55 of eq.([polsimp ] ) and eq.([disppol ] ) , respectively correspond to the second diagram on the right - hand side of the first line in fig .",

    "[ bsfig2 ] and is defined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 for a scalar residual interaction the contributions of @xmath58 are nonzero only for the density response , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "the numerical solution of the equations for the in - medium vertex is exorbitantly difficult @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the complex structure of the spectral functions .",
    "therefore in the following we present results only at finite temperature and for a relatively large value of the momentum transfer @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the spectral functions are relatively smooth and therefore easier to handle in numerical calculations .",
    "( [ gdlg ] ) , ( [ gdpm ] ) , ( [ glg])-([polext2 ] ) are solved by iteration for each given @xmath26 and @xmath31 , using the green s functions @xmath60 dressed by the self - energy ( [ self ] ) .",
    "using eq.([eq : respons ] ) we can then calculate the response function @xmath61 which accounts for the effects of the residual interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ polirr ] we show the results for this polarization function with vertex corrections @xmath62 for @xmath63mev .",
    "the results for the imaginary part of the response function originating from the naive one - loop polarization ( [ polsimp ] ) calculated with dressed propagators are represented by the dashed line . as compared to the hartree - fock response function ( dashed - dotted line ) this one - loop calculation with dressed propagators",
    "yields a significant tail at large excitation energies . as the dressed propagators include effects of two - particle one - hole and two - hole one - particle contributions to the propagation of particle and holes , the dressed response functions accounts for admixtures of two - particle two - hole contributions to the response functions .",
    "therefore one may interprete this high - energy tail to describe a shift of the excitation strength to higher energies due to the admixture of these two - particle two - hole contributions .",
    "if , however , we also account for the vertex corrections which are due to the residual interaction , we obtain the response functions represented by the solid line in the case of the density response and the dotted line in the case of the response for the other spin - isospin channels .",
    "one can see that in all cases the high - energy tail obtained in the simple one - loop result is compensated by the vertex corrections .",
    "this means that the induced interaction term , which for our scalar residual interaction is present in all spin - isospin channels , is responsible for this cancellation at high energies .",
    "the difference between the density response @xmath64 and the response in other spin - isospin channels is due to the sub - leading vertex corrections represented by the second and third graph in fig .",
    "[ kernelfig ] for @xmath29 .",
    "these vertex corrections , which are specific for the density response , lead to an enhancement of the imaginary part of @xmath64 at small energies , which makes the final result look rather similar to the free response function without any corrections of propagator and vertex due to the residual interaction .",
    "the free response and the consistently calculated response functions in the correlated system should fulfill several sum rules . for the scalar residual interaction the @xmath25-sum rule takes the simple form @xmath65 in all the spin isospin channels @xmath66 .",
    "the self - energy takes into account also the mean - field interaction , so the sum rule is only approximate and since the response @xmath62 does not include the rpa corrections on the right hand side of ( [ sumreq ] ) we substitute the free mass with the effective mass .",
    "such a modified sum rule is fulfilled to within a few percent by the response functions including vertex corrections @xmath67 , it is severely violated by the naive one - loop response function ( [ polsimp ] ) . the mean - field interaction contains spin and isospin dependent terms , and the sum rule including the mean - field part of the interaction could include a possible rpa enhancement factor @xcite besides the free fermi gas sum rule ( [ sumreq ] ) .",
    "when restricting the rpa response to the landau parameter form ( [ landaurpa ] ) the @xmath25-sum rule has the same form as in the free fermi gas ( [ sumreq ] ) but with the corresponding effective mass instead of the free nucleon mass .",
    "we find that the vertex corrections due to the first diagram for the kernel @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ bsfig2 ] ) , the so - called induced interaction terms , are the most important ones to bring the response function close to the one for the free fermi case and restore the @xmath25-sum rule .    adding the hartree - fock terms in the self - energy",
    "modifies the kernel of the equation for the dressed vertex .",
    "as explained above we take the rpa sum into account by means of the landau parameter for the mean - field part of the interaction . the resulting response functions in different channels",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ polfig ] .",
    "we plot also the response function for a fermi liquid , where the landau parameters and the effective mass are given by the original gogny interaction . for the density response",
    "the result is very close to the response of a fermi liquid . in all the channels the naive one - loop polarization with dressed propagators",
    "gives a incorrect description , with long tail at large energies .",
    "in fact the lindhard function , i.e. the one - loop polarization with hf propagators , gives a much better description of the response function @xcite , similar to the one including full dressed propagators and vertices . in the spin isospin response some difference to the response of a fermi liquid is observed , which could already be seen in fig [ polirr ] .",
    "however the constraint of the @xmath25-sum rule makes the response in the correlated systems to lie close to the fermi liquid one also in the nonzero spin and/or isospin channels ; the overall shape of @xmath68 is similar to the rpa response function .",
    "the description of weak processes in dense nuclear matter is very important for modeling supernovae explosions and the cooling of neutron stars . in a hot and dense medium neutrinos",
    "have a short mean free path and they are effectively trapped inside the proto - neutron star .",
    "the calculation of the mean free path involves nuclear correlation effects .",
    "the relevant hadronic part of the cross section can be factorized in the form of the density and spin response in matter . in this section",
    "we present a calculation the response functions in pure neutron matter .    as for the symmetric nuclear matter",
    ", the mean - field interaction has to be modified in order to take into account additional contributions from the residual interaction . in this first exploratory work we opt for a parameterization which is different in pure neutron matter and in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the modifications of the mean field interaction are listed in the third colum of parameters in table [ table ] . in this way",
    "we can reproduce the same fermi energy and similar effective mass as given by the original gogny interaction for a range of densities between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at the same time",
    "the landau parameters are not modified drastically from their value corresponding to the original gogny parameters displayed in the first column of table [ table ] .",
    "the formulas for the density and spin response in neutron matter can be written in the same way as outlined in section [ respsect ] .",
    "we find that for the density response the whole kernel @xmath29 displayed in fig .",
    "[ bsfig2 ] must be considered in the bs equation , while for the spin response only the first graph in the kernel @xmath29 , the induced interaction term , is nonzero ( @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) .",
    "the results are very similar to what we found for the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "when both propagator and vertex modification in the medium are taken into account the response function in the correlated system is very similar to the one obtained in the fermi liquid theory ( fig [ polne ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising , since the @xmath25-sum rule has the same form as in the noninteracting system .",
    "the naive one - loop response function with dressed propagators can not be trusted and violates the sum rule .      both for the symmetric and pure neutron matter we find that the response function in a correlated system is very close to response function in free fermi gas , or when the mean field is taken into account the response function is similar as in the fermi liquid theory .",
    "this means that the cancellation of propagator dressing and vertex correction effectively drives the response of the system to the response given by the excitation of a single particle - hole pair .    however , this result is not general .",
    "this cancellation is due to the particular form of the residual interaction , which we have considered to be scalar in spin and isospin .",
    "this also leads to the simple form ( [ sumreq ] ) of the @xmath25-sum rule in all the channels .",
    "therefore , for the discussion in this section we modify the residual interaction and assume it to be isospin dependent in the form @xmath73 in symmetric nuclear matter the single - particle self - energy is the same as obtained for the scalar residual interaction .",
    "therefore the same modified gogny parameterization of the mean field interaction is used as in section [ residualmf ] .",
    "the kernel @xmath29 of the bs equation , however , is different than in the case of a scalar residual interaction . for the @xmath74 channel all the three graphs for @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ kernelfig ] contribute .",
    "however , for the response function in channels with isospin @xmath75 the first diagram in @xmath29 , the induced interaction term does not contribute . we have found previously that this induced interaction diagram in the vertex dressing is crucial for the suppression of the high - energy tail in the response function .",
    "this led to the restoration of the @xmath25-sum rule and made the response function similar to the one in the free fermi gas .",
    "so if this induced interaction contribution to the vertex dressing is absent ( channels @xmath76 ) we expect a strong modification of the response function by the residual interaction .",
    "the vertex and propagator dressing do no longer cancel .",
    "in fact , in the channel @xmath77 there are no vertex corrections at all ( @xmath78 ) , and the response function has the same form as a naive one - loop calculation with dressed propagators .    in fig .",

    "it has a larger width due to the contribution of multi - pair configurations , analogously as in the density response .",
    "the isospin dependent residual interaction leads to a response @xmath85 with a long tail at large energies . due to the large contribution of these configurations",
    "the width of the collective states in the isovector response is very large .",
    "in fact , the collective mode disappears .",
    "the disappearance of the collective mode is an extreme case where the coupling to multi - pair state is not reduced by vertex corrections ( special case of the interaction ( [ newres ] ) ) .    for a general interaction",
    "we expect a whole range of behavior depending on the energy of the collective state and on the strength of isospin dependent terms in the residual interaction",
    ". the collective state would be generally broader than in the fermi liquid theory , due to the coupling to multi - pair configurations .",
    "in some cases this coupling can lead to a disappearance of the collective state .",
    "the same phenomena are expected also for the spin wave collective state in the presence of spin dependent residual interactions .",
    "the aim of this paper has been a consistent study of correlation effects on the response function going beyond the usual hf plus rpa approach . for that purpose",
    "we consider a mean - field interaction and a residual interaction .",
    "this residual interaction generates contributions to the self - energy of the nucleons , which describe the admixture of two - hole one - particle and two - particle one - hole configurations to the single - particle propagator",
    ".    the response function using these dressed propagators in a one - loop approximation will in general violate the energy weighted sum rule for the excitation function .",
    "these sum - rules are fulfilled only if the response functions are calculated employing a consistent treatment of propagator and vertex corrections following the recipe of baym and kadanoff @xcite .",
    "a scheme for such a consistent treatment of correlation effects in the response function of nuclear matter is outlined and numerical results are presented for symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter at finite temperature .    assuming a residual interaction of scalar - isoscalar form it turns out that the effects originating from propagator corrections are to a large extent compensated by vertex corrections in the response function for all spin - isospin channels .",
    "the induced interaction terms in particular are responsible for the compensation of the correlation effects in the single - particle propagator .",
    "if , however , a residual interaction with non - trivial spin isospin structure is considered this cancellation of correlation effects is removed in specific spin - isospin channels .",
    "consequences for the damping of collective excitation modes due to these admixtures of multi - particle multi - hole contributions are discussed .",
    "the present investigation employs residual interaction with a rather simple spin - isospin structure .",
    "more realistic interaction models should be investigated in extended kinematical regions of @xmath26 and @xmath31 to obtain detailed information on the importance of correlation effects on the nuclear response for the various excitation modes .    *",
