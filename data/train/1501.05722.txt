    "<S> contrarily to a common belief , any beam of light possesses to a some extent the ability to `` reconstruct itself '' after hitting an obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> the celebrated arago spot phenomenon is nothing but a manifestation of this property . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the self - healing mechanism from both a mathematical and a physical point of view , eventually finding a new expression for the minimum reconstruction distance , which is valid for _ any _ kind of beam , including gaussian ones . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a witness function that quantify the self - reconstruction capability of a beam is proposed and tested . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here help clarifying the physics underlying self - healing mechanism in optical beams . </S>"
