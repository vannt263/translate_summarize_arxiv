    "holographic qcd has been the topic of numerous studies after the discovery of gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the studied models can be roughly divided into two classes , the top - down and the bottom - up models .",
    "the top - down models are fixed constructions directly based on string theory and motivated by the original ads / cft duality . in particular",
    ", the dual field theory can usually be identified exactly , and the gravitational description does not bring in any extra parameters : all parameter of the gravitational action are uniquely fixed . the ultimate goal of this kind of constructions would be to to find an explicit holographic realization for the infrared ( ir ) physics of qcd , at large number of colors @xmath0 .",
    "however , so far the available models have some shortcomings .",
    "most importantly , when classical calculations are reliable on the gravity side , the low - energy spectrum of the dual field theory has additional ( kaluza - klein ) states at the same mass scale as the states of qcd . nevertheless , the observables computed in these models are in good agreement with our knowledge of qcd ( see  @xcite for concrete examples ) .    in",
    "the bottom - up approach one usually takes only the main ideas from string theory .",
    "the holographic ( often five dimensional ) model is constructed `` by hand '' by picking the most important operators on the field theory side , and then writing down a natural action for their dual fields .",
    "this means that the coupling constants , masses and/or potentials of the constructed action are not known , but need to be chosen by comparing the results to the field theory .",
    "therefore the holographic description is necessarily effective and and a wide class of gauge theories is modeled instead of a definite single theory .",
    "typically the action is chosen such that it respects general symmetries and other features found in top - down constructions .",
    "they are able to produce a very precise description of qcd data ( such as the meson spectrum ) just by fitting a few parameters .",
    "well - known examples of this type of models are  @xcite . here",
    "we will discuss a specific bottom - up approach which is more strictly based on string theory than is typical for bottom - up models .",
    "so far the majority of the literature on holographic qcd discusses flavor the t hooft or probe limit , where one takes @xmath1 keeping @xmath2 and the t hooft coupling @xmath3 fixed . here",
    "we will , however , also consider the backreaction of the flavor to the glue , which is present if we take the veneziano limit instead .",
    "it is defined by @xmath4    backreaction means that the analysis will necessarily be technically involved .",
    "taking it into account is , however , important for several reasons .",
    "first , the number of light quarks @xmath5 is comparable to the number of colors @xmath6 for ordinary qcd , so that the backreaction is expected to be strong .",
    "but there are also phenomena ( e.g. , phase transitions ) which can not be accessed in the probe limit at all . from arguments based on perturbation theory ,",
    "it is clear that qcd has the so called conformal window : the theory has a nontrivial ir fixed point and chiral symmetry is intact for some @xmath2 , @xmath0 with not so small @xmath7 ( whereas in the t hooft limit @xmath8 ) .",
    "more precisely , in the veneziano limit , the leading coefficient of the qcd beta function vanishes at @xmath9 . as @xmath10 from below",
    ", the theory has an perturbative ir fixed point , i.e. , a fixed point at a small value of the coupling .",
    "but for small @xmath11 the ir physics is expected to be similar to ordinary qcd , with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore a phase transition must take place at some critical value @xmath12 of the ratio @xmath11 , which marks the lower edge of the conformal window .",
    "this transition has been called the conformal transition .",
    "it has been conjectured that right below the transition the ir fixed point is still visible as the theory displays `` walking '' ( nearly conformal ) behavior , i.e. , the coupling constant stays approximately constant for a large range of energies .    in the models discussed here ,",
    "pure yang - mills is modeled by improved holographic qcd ( ihqcd )  @xcite .",
    "this model is inspired by five dimensional string theory , but also contains a potential term which is not fixed a priori .",
    "flavor can be introduced in ihqcd by adding a pair of space - filling five dimensional d - branes  @xcite . including full backreaction , by taking in the veneziano limit ,",
    "then leads to the v - qcd models  @xcite .",
    "walking dynamics and the conformal transition have also been studied in closely related but simpler models called dynamic ads / qcd  @xcite .    in these proceedings",
    "we will first discuss ihqcd and v - qcd in more detail .",
    "then we will give an overview of the results obtained in the v - qcd models .",
    "improved holographic qcd ( ihqcd )  @xcite is a model for the yang - mills theory .",
    "it is loosely based on five dimensional noncritical string theory .",
    "it is defined in terms of the five dimensional action [ lihqcd ] s_= m^3 n_c^2 d^5x ( r-43 ( ) ^2+v_g ( ) ) where the first term defines the five dimensional einstein gravity and @xmath13 is the dilaton .",
    "we denote @xmath14 and identify the t hooft coupling as the vacuum solution @xmath15 , with the vacuum being the extremum of the action  . here",
    "@xmath16 denotes the fifth bulk coordinate .",
    "the ansatz for the metric is ds^2=e^2 a(r ) ( dx_1,3 ^ 2+dr^2 ) [ metric1 ] in the vacuum solution .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is identified as the logarithm of the energy scale in field theory . in our conventions",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) boundary lies at @xmath18 , and the bulk coordinate runs from zero to infinity .",
    "the metric will be close to the ads near the uv .",
    "the model deviates from the `` top - down '' derivation from five dimensional noncritical string theory as the dilaton potential @xmath19 is fixed by hand rather than derived from string theory .",
    "its asymptotic behavior is determined using as a guideline known properties of glue dynamics in yang - mills theory . in the ir ( i.e. , large values of the coupling @xmath20 ) ,",
    "potential which diverges as [ vgir ] v_g~^4 / 3  , (  )  , generates confinement , a mass gap , discrete spectrum and asymptotically linear glueball trajectories @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this matches with the behavior predicted by string theory @xmath21 up to the logarithmic correction , which is important to ensure exactly linear trajectories .    in the uv ( i.e. , as @xmath22 ) ,",
    "the geometry is asymptotically ads and the coupling @xmath20 has logarithmic dependence on @xmath16 , similar the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the coupling in yang - mills , when @xmath19 is analytic at @xmath23 .",
    "the holographic beta function defined by the above dictionary , @xmath24 , then admits a taylor expansion at @xmath23 ( with @xmath20 evaluated on the vacuum solution ) .",
    "the coefficients in the taylor expansion of @xmath19 are chosen such that the holographic beta function agrees with the perturbative beta function of yang - mills up to two - loops .    at intermediate couplings",
    "@xmath19 must be fitted to yang - mills data .",
    "most precise constraints are obtained by studying the thermodynamic functions  @xcite .",
    "even a two parameter fit gives a very good description of the lattice data  @xcite .",
    "a framework for adding flavor in holographic models has been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is realized through adding a pair of @xmath254-@xmath264 branes which therefore fill the whole space in a five dimensional holographic model .",
    "the string stretching between the branes gives rise to a tachyon field , which is dual to the @xmath27 operator on the field theory side , and therefore controls chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the dynamics of the tachyon @xmath28 is governed by a tachyon - dirac - born - infeld ( tdbi ) action , and taking an exponential potential , @xmath29 , for the tachyon .",
    "the framework has been tested in the probe approximation  @xcite with encouraging results .",
    "the v - qcd models arise as the fusion of ihqcd with this framework for adding flavor , in the veneziano limit where flavor fully backreacts to the glue  @xcite .",
    "the main degrees of freedom are therefore the `` dilaton '' @xmath30 and the tachyon @xmath28 .",
    "the dictionary is as stated above : ( the background value of ) @xmath20 is the t hooft coupling , and @xmath28 is dual to @xmath27 .",
    "the terms in the v - qcd action which determine the vacuum solution are @xmath31 the first term is simply the ihqcd action   and describes the dynamics of the glue in the model .",
    "the second term is a generalized tdbi action , which describes the dynamics of the flavor . from the factors of @xmath0 and @xmath2",
    "it is clear that both terms are leading in the veneziano limit and there is indeed full backreaction .",
    "notice that the form of the tdbi action is precisely known only in the probe limit .",
    "therefore we have introduced a more general ansatz in  .",
    "for the tachyon potential we assume the form v_f( , ) = v_f0()e^-a()^2 where the dependence on the tachyon is the same as in the probe limit above . the potentials",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 would be power laws in the probe limit , but we have taken them to be arbitrary functions of @xmath20 .    in order to pin down the model , we need to specify the functions @xmath35 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "it turns out that the dilaton potential @xmath35 must obey the same asymptotic constraints which were found in ihqcd . for the other functions",
    "similar constraints are found , both in the ir and in the uv .    in the ir ( @xmath36 ) , the functions are constrained , among other things , by the asymptotics of the spectra at large excitation numbers , and by requiring that the geometry has a `` good '' kind of ir singularity that uniquely fixes all ir boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , we find the following asymptotics  @xcite : a( ) ~  ; (  ) ~^-4/3  , (  )  .",
    "interestingly , these asymptotics again agree with the string theory prediction , up to the logarithmic correction in @xmath33 , in analogy to what was found for @xmath35 in  .    in the uv ( @xmath22 ) the potentials must approach constant values in order for the dimension of the @xmath27 operator to be correctly reproduced , and for the geometry to be asymptotically ads in the uv . in analogy to the approach taken in ihqcd  @xcite , we take the potentials to be analytic at @xmath23 and match the coefficients of their expansions with those of the perturbative beta function of qcd and the anomalous dimension of the quark mass @xmath37 .",
    "this matching is done in order to guarantee correct boundary conditions for the ir dynamics , which can be more reliably modeled by holography and is therefore more interesting in this model .",
    "the remaining freedom is the dependence of the potentials on @xmath20 at intermediate values , which can be fitted to lattice and qcd data ( neglecting the @xmath38 corrections arising when one moves from the veneziano limit to finite @xmath0 ) in order to build a concrete model for qcd .",
    "such a fit will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "the results below are based on potentials which obey the asymptotics found above , but were not yet fitted to any data .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to uncover the phase structure of v - qcd , we write an ansatz where the fields @xmath15 and @xmath39 depend on the bulk coordinate @xmath16 , and the metric has the form  .",
    "the ansatz is then inserted to the equations of motion derived from the action  , which are consequently solved numerically .",
    "this procedure results in phase diagram ( at zero temperature and quark mass ) that is essentially universal and shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "the diagram has two phases separated by a phase transition at @xmath40 :    * in the region @xmath41 , the theory has chiral symmetry breaking , and ir dynamics is similar to that of ordinary qcd .",
    "the corresponding background solution has nontrivial @xmath15 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with the tachyon diverging at the `` good '' ir singularity of the geometry .",

    "the conformal transition and the walking regime , on the contrary , are generated by the dynamics of the model in a nontrivial way  @xcite .",
    "one can show that the conformal transition is related to a well - known instability of the tachyon field in the conformal window .",
    "this instability arises when the five dimensional bulk mass of the tachyon , evaluated at the ir fixed point , violates the so - called breitenlohner - freedman bound  @xcite .",
    "transition triggered by the violation of this bound quite in general leads to walking and a bkt / miransky phase transition of infinite order .",
