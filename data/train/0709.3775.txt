    "recently , a tremendous experimental effort has been devoted to the task of cooling mechanical oscillators below the energy of quantum fluctuations . in spite of many experimental improvements",
    ", the quantum limit has not been achieved.@xcite several papers that propose cooling mechanisms using electromagnetic ( rf , microwave or light ) resonators@xcite or other cooling mechanisms@xcite to fulfill this task have appeared recently .",
    "these papers predict an enormous cooling effect .",
    "however , they do not explicitly state that there is a lower limit on the achievable temperature , associated with the ratio between the frequencies of the coolant and cooled oscillators , that can not be overcome and can play an important role for realistic experimental realizations .",
    "moreover , some formulas that appear in the literature can give temperatures below this limit , which will be described in more detail below .",
    "this lower temperature limit can be important for the most feasible designs using rf or microwave resonators .",
    "the electromagnetic resonators can be easily implemented on - chip beside a nano - mechanical oscillator and kept at low temperatures .",
    "such structures , also known as mems and nems ( micro and nanoelectromechanical systems ) , have already been realized @xcite , achieving high frequencies in the ghz range ( @xmath4  ghz ) but with small quality factors @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , they can be used as sensitive elements for weak force - displacement detection@xcite and they have been proposed as possible qubits.@xcite for such systems , the frequency of the basic mode of the nems becomes comparable to the resonance frequency of the electromagnetic resonator @xmath0 . in this case , the temperature limit proportional to @xmath6 which was negligible for optical - frequency coolers , can determine the lowest achievable temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of this work is to call the attention of experimentalists to this fundamental limit which could help them design more effective cooling systems .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will consider a rlc tank circuit ( the results can be applied to any electromagnetic resonator , such as a transmission - line resonator , cavity , fabry - perot resonator , etc . ) .",
    "a mechanical oscillator is coupled to the capacitor such that the capacitance depends parametrically on the displacement of the oscillator .",
    "such a system was thoroughly analyzed in ref .  , and we only briefly introduce the equations of motion here . if the mechanical oscillator is a part of one of the capacitor electrodes , the capacitance @xmath7 depends on the displacement @xmath8 of the oscillator from the equilibrium position , where @xmath9 is the capacitance at @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the renormalized distance between the electrodes @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the coupling constant between the mechanical oscillator and the rlc circuit , and it can be expressed as the ratio between the mechanical oscillator capacitance @xmath14 , which depends on the oscillator displacement , and the total capacitance @xmath15 ( we consider the case @xmath16 ) , i.e. @xmath17 . if the rlc tank circuit is pumped by a microwave source @xmath18 , the voltage between the capacitor s electrodes is @xmath19 , and the coulomb energy of the capacitor depends on its capacitance which , in turn , depends on the oscillator displacement . thus , the electromagnetic resonator and mechanical oscillator ( i.e. cantilever ) can be described by a system of differential equations of two coupled damped linear oscillators @xmath20 where @xmath21 are damping rates , @xmath22 are angular frequencies , @xmath23 is a fluctuating voltage across the capacitor , @xmath24 is a fluctuating force acting on the mechanical oscillator with mass @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is total charge charge on the capacitor .",
    "( [ eq : lrcxb ] ) is nonlinear but can be linearized keeping in mind that we are interested to calculate charge fluctuations @xmath27 which are much smaller than charge oscillations @xmath28 driving by coherent microwave source .",
    "it is convinient to express @xmath27 and @xmath29 in terms of quadrature amplitudes @xmath30 and rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lrcxa]),([eq : lrcxb ] ) in the dimensionless variables @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the temperatures of the electromagnetic resonator and mechanical oscillator , respectively . using the slowly - varying - amplitude approximation@xcite and considering langevin fluctuating forces caused by quantum noise,@xcite @xmath34 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lrcxa]),([eq : lrcxb ] ) read @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the base temperatures of the resonator and mechanical oscillator , respectively .",
    "thus , we have a system of coupled langevin equations@xcite which allow us to calculate the stationary covariance matrix defined as @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix determine the mean squared values of the vector components @xmath43 .",
    "for example , @xmath44 is the normalized mean squared velocity of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "the covariance matrix can be determined from the system of linear equations @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a correlation matrix defined as @xmath47 .",
    "if the fluctuating forces are uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath48 ( here @xmath49 stand for @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) , @xmath46 takes the form of a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath52 the mean value of energy of the mechanical oscillator fluctuations is @xmath53 now , one can easily calculate the effective temperature of the mechanical oscillator from the definition relation for @xmath54 @xmath55 as we will see later , the most appropriate parameters for cooling purposes are @xmath56 , @xmath57 . in this limit and for @xmath58 , @xmath59 the @xmath60 can be expressed as @xmath61 thus , the lowest temperature of the mechanical oscillator is limited by the first term if the second term is made negligibly small by sideband cooling . as a matter of fact this term simply shows that even in our semi - classical approach we can not ` cool ' the mechanical oscillator below the zero - point energy which is consistent with the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "indeed , it follows from eqs.([eq : em ] ) and ( [ eq : svv ] ) that the energy saved in the mechanical oscillator is @xmath62 in this limit , the effective temperature @xmath54 of the mechanical oscillator takes the simple form @xmath63 the cooling factor @xmath64 as a function of the normalized pumping amplitude @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_m ] .     as a function of the normalized pumping amplitude @xmath65 of the noiseless microwave source for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 calculated numerically ( circles ) and from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : svv]),([eq : sigma33 ] ) ( solid line).,width=264 ]    even though this result was derived within semi - classical physics , the same limit can be obtained using the quantum approach , as we shall show below .    here",
    "we should emphasize that the temperature of the resonator @xmath32 is usually much higher than the ambient temperature if the resonator is heavily pumped by the microwave source .",
    "this is caused by the phase noise of the microwave source , which is directly proportional to the output power .",
    "microwave sources are characterized by the single sideband noise spectral density@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mean - square voltage of the microwave source and @xmath72 is the spectral density of the voltage noise .",
    "the best commercially available microwave sources achieve @xmath73  dbc / hz . the effective temperature @xmath32 of the pumped resonator can be calculated as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the temperature of the resonator without pumping and @xmath76 is the characteristic impedance of the resonator .",
    "now , both terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma33 ] ) depend on the pumping power .",
    "the first one increases with pumping power while the second one decreases .",
    "since the highest cooling power is expected for@xcite @xmath77 the effective temperature of the mechanical oscillator is higher than @xmath78 thus , for microwave resonators the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma33 ] ) becomes important , especially for the cooling of mechanical oscillators with high resonant frequencies approaching the ghz range .",
    "the minimal temperature @xmath79 is directly proportional to the pumping power in the limit @xmath80 , which is the relevant limit in order to determine the lowest achievable temperature of the mechanical oscillator cooled by sideband cooling .",
    "in order to achieve the quantum regime of the mechanical oscillator , the temperature should be lower than the energy of quantum fluctuations which , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_ml ] ) , imply the inequality @xmath81 thus the microwave resonator should be in the quantum regime as well , and the classical description is no longer valid .",
    "therefore , we now turn to the analysis of this problem using the quantum description when the resonator s frequency is higher than its temperature and the resonator is in its ground state with high probability .",
    "the analysis is also valid if the resonator is substituted by a two - level system ( qubit ) as sugested in ref .  .",
    "in this case the cooling limit can be derived in a transparent manner .",
    "the hamiltonian that we shall use in our analysis is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) are , respectively , the creation and annihilation operators of the resonator ( oscillator ) .",
    "the term @xmath87 represents the oscillator - resonator coupling , and the term @xmath88 represents the driving force .",
    "we shall assume that the last two terms in the hamiltonian are small : the smallness of @xmath87 means that the energy eigenstates will , to a good approximation , be identified with well - defined excitation numbers in the oscillator and resonator , while the smallness of @xmath88 justifies a description of the system using time - independent energy levels . in the following we start by using thermodynamics arguments to derive an expression for the lower limit on the achievable temperature , and we later use a master - equation approach to treat the specific example discussed in sec .  [ sec : classical ] .",
    "we first consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyladder1 ] .",
    "each arrow describes a transition from a state @xmath89 to another state @xmath90 , where the meaning of the quantum numbers is explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyladder1 ] .",
    "we denote the rate at which such a transition occurs by @xmath91 . in other words ,",
    "the probability current of the transition is given by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the occupation probability of the state @xmath89 . in the steady state",
    ", we can write detailed - balance equations for the occupation probabilities of the different quantum states in the form    @xmath94    now we determine some relations among rates @xmath95 .",
    "let us start with situation when the driving force is switched off and the resonator is in contact with its surrounding environment , which is at temperature @xmath32 .",
    "assuming that the environment induces transitions between states that are different by one photon in the resonator , the rates must obey the thermal - equilibrium relation @xmath96 note that these transitions do not change the state of the mechanical oscillator , since without the driving force the oscillator and resonator are effectively decoupled ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the oscillator is itself in contact with its environment at temperature @xmath33 , but for optimal cooling we assume that the insulation is good enough that we can completely neglect environment - induced transitions , i.e.  we have assumed that @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyladder1 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : detailed_balance ] ) .",
    "we now assume that the driving force couples states of the form @xmath89 and @xmath98 but does not drive any other transitions . since the driving force is a classical one , the transitions it induces must have equal rates in both directions , i.e. @xmath99 the reason why there is no boltzmann factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates2 ] ) is that these transitions are mainly induced by the classical driving force , and any contributions to their rates from the thermal environment are negligible .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rates1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rates2 ] ) , it is not difficult to verify that the pairs of terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : detailed_balance ] ) all vanish when @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the partition function .",
    "this steady - state probability distribution @xmath93 can now be rewritten as @xmath102 with @xmath103 here @xmath104 and @xmath105 is partition function of resonator and mechanical oscillator , respectively .",
    "we therefore find that if the above picture about the allowed transitions and the relations governing their rates are valid , we can reach the final temperature @xmath106 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t*t ] ) .",
    "the above derivation suggests an intuitive picture for the cooling mechanism .",
    "the purpose of the driving force is to facilitate the transfer of excitations between the resonator and oscillator .",
    "before the driving starts , the low - frequency oscillator has many more excitations than the high - frequency resonator .",
    "once the driving starts , the excitation imbalance causes excitations to start flowing from the oscillator to the resonator .",
    "as the number of excitations in the resonator goes above the thermal - equilibrium value , excitations start to dissipate from the resonator to the environment .",
    "a steady state is eventually reached with the resonator in thermal equilibrium with the environment and both the resonator and the oscillator having the same average number of excitations ( in fact , the resonator and the oscillator will have the same excitation - number probability distribution ) .",
    "this picture of the cooling mechanism reveals another point that is generally not noted in the literature .",
    "although @xmath107 is desired to be smaller than @xmath108 in order to avoid heating effects , it should not be too small , because it provides the mechanism by which excitations are dissipated from the resonator into the environment .",
    "in particular , it must be larger than @xmath109 , such that the dissipation of excitations is faster than the heating of the oscillator by its environment .    , but with the driving force inducing a different type of transitions .",
    "the driven transitions in this case remove one excitation from the oscillator state and add two excitations to the resonator state , or vice versa.,width=264 ]    we now consider what would happen if one were able to drive transitions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyladder2 ] . with optimal parameters for cooling",
    ", one would obtain the minimum temperature @xmath110 note that this situation would require driving the system at a frequency @xmath111 .",
    "the argument can be generalized to obtain any value @xmath112 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t*t2 ] ) , or more explicitly @xmath113 the question is whether such transitions can be realistically driven in a given system with a specific form of resonator - oscillator coupling and a given type of driving force .    in order to determine the feasibility of realizing conditions where eq .",
    "( [ eq : t*tn ] ) with @xmath114 is the relevant lower limit on the achievable temperature , we now turn from the above general arguments to the specific situation considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : classical ] .",
    "equations ( [ eq : lrcxa]),([eq : lrcxb ] ) result from a hamiltonian of the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the oscillator - resonator coupling strength , and @xmath117 is the amplitude of the driving force . starting with a simplified version of the above hamiltonian that does not contain the last two terms , we have an energy - level diagram similar to the one shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : energyladder1 ] ( without the induced - transition arrows ) .",
    "the resonator - oscillator coupling term mixes the different quantum states together in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "this mixing allows the driving term , which would normally affect only the resonator , to drive transitions that remove excitations from the oscillator and add excitations to the resonator , or vice versa .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the transitions that can be driven by the external force , we need to evaluate matrix elements of the form @xmath118 , where we now use the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( i.e. slightly modified from the case of two uncoupled oscillators ) . to first order in perturbation theory ,    @xmath119    using the above approximation",
    ", we find that @xmath120 it is straightforward to see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) that @xmath121 using numerical calculations we find that @xmath122    the above results imply that the driving term can be used to drive transitions of the form @xmath123 , and their resonance frequency is given by @xmath124 . the steady - state effective temperature for the oscillator",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t*t ] ) when driving these transitions , assuming that heating effects are avoided . by driving the system at the frequency @xmath125",
    ", one could in principle drive the transitions @xmath126 and reach a lower minimum temperature .",
    "however , the fact that the corresponding matrix element is proportional to the third power of the small coupling strength @xmath116 suggests that this matrix element will be extremely small for any realistic parameters , hindering the possibility of utilizing this cooling mechanism .",
    "we now turn to the heating effects that have been neglected above .",
    "we note that the driving term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can also drive transitions of the form @xmath127 these undesired transitions are induced if either the driving amplitude @xmath117 or the resonator s damping rate @xmath107 is comparable to or larger than @xmath108 . if either one or both of the above conditions are satisfied , the driving force must be considered within the resonance region of the above transition . as a result , additional excitation would be steadily pumped into the system , resulting in a higher temperature than what would be obtained from the simple picture of transition rates that we have presented above .",
    "the ideal parameters for cooling are therefore given by @xmath124 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ; naturally @xmath109 is desired to be much smaller than both @xmath107 and @xmath130 , such that the oscillator heating from its contact with the environment is slower than the cooling it experiences as a result of the driving . using a numerical simulation",
    ", we shall see shortly that the above heating effects can be made negligible with the proper choice of parameters .",
    "we should also mention here that in this section we have not considered the noise in the driving force , i.e. we have assumed a perfect microwave source .",
