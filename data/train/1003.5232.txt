    "in 2002 , the analysis of @xmath5 decays performed by the e791 collaboration revealed that approximately 50% of these decays proceed through a low - mass scalar resonance with isospin @xmath6 : the @xmath7 , also called the @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the @xmath5 decay was revisited by e791  @xcite and two other experiments produced analyses based on larger data samples , namely focus  @xcite and cleo  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of the pioneering e791 work have been confirmed in both cases .    in the past , many analyses of @xmath1 scattering data had already claimed the presence of the @xmath8 pole in the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "the most precise and model independent determination of its position in the second riemann sheet was produced in ref .",
    "@xcite . using roy s equations for @xmath1 scattering @xcite and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite",
    "descotes - genon and moussallam found @xmath9 mev and @xmath10  mev  @xcite .",
    "although the experimental results are sound and the @xmath8 pole is at present theoretically well known , a comprehensive and successful description of the reaction @xmath5 is still not available ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "experimentalists , for the want of a better framework , commonly fit their data with the isobar model which consists of a weighted sum of breit - wigner - like propagators .",
    "often , a complex constant is added to the amplitude in order to account for the non - resonant decays .",
    "it is known , nevertheless , that the adoption of breit - wigner functions to describe the effect of scalar resonances is problematic .    in the present work ,",
    "we follow the general scheme where a factorised weak decay amplitude is dressed with fsis by means of non - perturbative @xmath1 form factors . for the weak vertex",
    ", we employ the effective weak hamiltonian of refs .",
    "@xcite within nave factorisation .",
    "the weak amplitude thus obtained receives contributions from colour - allowed and colour - suppressed topologies . in the latter ,",
    "the @xmath1 form factors appear manifestly and the construction of the final state is straightforward .",
    "the colour - allowed topology is more involved but , assuming the decay to be mediated by resonances as suggested by the experimental results , the fsis in this case can also be written in terms of @xmath1 form factors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our description the hadronic fsis are fully taken into account by the @xmath1 scalar and vector form factors .",
    "both form factors have received attention in recent years and are now well known in the energy regime relevant to @xmath5 decays .",
    "the scalar component was studied in a framework that incorporates all the known theoretical constraints in refs .",
    "the results were subsequently updated and we employ in this work the state - of - the - art version given in ref .",
    "the vector form factor , in its turn , can be studied in @xmath11 decays  @xcite , where the kinematical range is very similar to the one considered in this paper .",
    "here we employ a description which fulfils analyticity constraints and that was successfully fitted to the belle spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this contribution is based on a recent paper where all the issues discussed here are presented in more detail @xcite .",
    "our phenomenological description of the process @xmath0 is based on the effective weak hamiltonian . at the quark level ,",
    "the decay @xmath0 is driven by the transition @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _  four different quark flavours are involved . in this case , only the two tree operators of the weak hamiltonian have to be taken into account .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath0 is given by the matrix element @xmath13 .",
    "we assume the factorisation approach to hold at leading order ( in @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and as a consequence the amplitude is written in terms of colour allowed and suppressed contributions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , as @xmath18 & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{g_f}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cos^2\\theta_c [ a_1\\langle k^-\\pi^+_1|\\bar s\\gamma^\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)c|d^+\\rangle          \\langle\\pi^+_2|\\bar u\\gamma_\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)d|0\\rangle\\\\[2ex ] & & + a_2\\langle k^-\\pi^+_1|\\bar s\\gamma^\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)d|0\\rangle          \\langle\\pi^+_2|\\bar u\\gamma_\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)c|d^+\\rangle ] % \\\\[1ex ] % & & + ( \\pi^+_1\\leftrightarrow\\pi^+_2)\\ , \\end{array } } \\ ] ] where the last term accounts for the presence of two identical pions in the final state .",
    "for the qcd factors @xmath19 we use the phenomenological values @xmath20 and @xmath21 , obtained from different analyses of two - body @xmath22 meson decays @xcite . the non - perturbative hadronic matrix elements in eq .",

    "we can now compare the absolute value of our @xmath2-wave amplitude with experimental results .",
    "however , since in isobar - like analyses the fit is sensitive only to the relative weights of the amplitudes , in order to compare the measurements with our result we need perform a normalisation .",
    "we define a normalised @xmath2-wave amplitude by @xmath43 .",

    "the @xmath1 hadronic fsis are treated in a quasi two - body approach by means of the well defined scalar and vector @xmath1 form factors , thereby imposing analyticity , unitarity and chiral symmetry constraints .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the use of the @xmath1 scalar form factor is shown to provide a good description of the @xmath2-wave fsis .",
    "both the modulus and the phase of our @xmath2 wave compare well with experimental data up to @xmath46  gev .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the form factor we used has a pole that can be identified with the @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the model is able to reproduce the experimental fit fractions and the total @xmath2-wave branching ratio",
    ". finally , the dalitz plot arising from the model agrees with a mc simulated data set .",
    "the main hypotheses of our model are the factorisation of the weak decay amplitude and the quasi two - body nature of the fsis .",
    "therefore , the success of our description for @xmath47  gev suggests that , in this domain , the physics of the decay is dominated by two - body @xmath1 interactions .",
    "we are led to conclude that effects not included in our model such as the @xmath48 non - resonant @xmath1 @xmath2 wave , the non - resonant @xmath49 @xmath50 interactions and genuine three - body interactions , could be considered as corrections to the general picture described here .",
    "part of the discrepancy observed in our dalitz plot is due to the disaccord of our @xmath2-wave amplitude for @xmath51  gev .",
    "a possible cause for this disagreement is the fact that factorisation in a three - body decay is expected to break down close to the edges of the dalitz plot  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this region , the kinematical configuration of the final state momenta renders the quasi two - body treatment less trustworthy as well .",
    "finally , our model does not include the tensor component .",
    "although marginal , this amplitude has a non - trivial distribution in the phase space and could induce sizable interference effects in our plots . in the vector channel",
    ", we find puzzling that the @xmath52 , which gives a sizable contribution for @xmath53  @xcite , is hardly seen in experimental analyses of @xmath5 .",
