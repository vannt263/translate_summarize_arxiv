    "much of observational cosmology depends upon the assumption that the spatial distribution of galaxies is related in a simple way to the underlying distribution of matter . at first",
    "it was hoped that the galaxy distribution might simply be a poisson realization of the matter distribution ; but as this model became difficult to reconcile with large scale peculiar velocities , the amplitude of microwave background fluctuations , the different clustering strengths of different galaxy types , and theoretical prejudice for @xmath4 , cosmologists began to assume an unspecified constant of proportionality @xmath12 between galaxy and mass fluctuations : @xmath13 .",
    "though many physical processes could in principle give rise to a relationship of this form ( e.g. dekel & rees 1987 ) , most were poorly understood , and , if invoked , would make it difficult to use galaxy observations to constrain the cosmological mass distribution",
    ". an important exception was gravitational instability .",
    "this is relatively well understood , and if it were dominant in determining where galaxies formed  if galaxies formed within virialized `` halos '' of dark matter , and if the poorly understood physics of star formation , supernova feedback , and so on were important only in determining the properties of galaxies within dark matter halos  then the large scale distribution of galaxies would still be related in a simple way to the underlying distribution of matter ; the value of the `` bias parameter '' @xmath12 in @xmath13 would be straightforward to calculate ( white & rees 1978 , kaiser 1984 , bardeen _ et al . _  1986 ,",
    "mo & white 1996 ) . because it maintains a simple relationship between galaxies and mass , agrees with our limited knowledge of the relevant physics , and seems consistent with numerical simulations , this `` dark halo '' model has become increasingly popular , and is now the basis of the modern understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "it is assumed in most analytic treatments , in semi - analytic models , and in numerical simulations which include only gravity ; and yet it remains a conjecture that has never been thoroughly tested .",
    "one prediction of the dark halo model is that galaxies of a given mass should form first in regions where the density is highest , and since such regions are expected to be strongly clustered ( e.g. kaiser 1984 ) , a natural test is to measure the clustering of galaxies in the young universe .",
    "the lyman - break technique ( e.g. , steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 ) provides a way to find large numbers of star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "star - forming galaxies have pronounced breaks in their spectra at 912   ( rest ) from a combination of absorption by neutral hydrogen in their interstellar media and the intrinsic spectra of massive stars . at @xmath14 this `` lyman break , '' strengthened from additional absorption by hydrogen in the unevolved intergalactic medium ,",
    "is redshifted sufficiently to be observed with ground - based broad - band photometry . by taking images through filters that straddle the redshifted lyman break , and looking for objects that are much fainter in images at wavelengths shortward of the break than longward of the break , one can efficiently separate high - redshift galaxies from the many foreground objects . in our implementation of the technique ,",
    "we have used deep photometry in the custom @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 filter system of steidel & hamilton ( 1993 ) to assemble a sample of over  1300 probable @xmath1 galaxies , of which more than  400 have been spectroscopically confirmed with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke _ et al . _  1995 ) on the w.  m.  keck telescopes .",
    "after initial spectroscopy in one 9@xmath0 18field , we argued , on the basis of a single large concentration of galaxies , that these @xmath1 lyman - break galaxies were much more strongly clustered than the mass , with an inferred bias parameter @xmath18 of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , and @xmath6  flat ( steidel _ et al . _",
    "qualitatively this strong biasing was consistent with the idea that galaxies form first in the ( strongly clustered ) densest regions of the universe , but there appeared to be quantitative problems . in the dark matter halo model",
    "there is an inverse relationship between the abundance and bias of a population of halos , with the rarest , most massive halos being the most strongly clustered ( i.e. , most `` biased '' ) . as emphasized by jing & suto ( 1998 ) , for halos to be as strongly clustered as lyman - break galaxies , they would have to be very rare indeed . yet",
    "lyman - break galaxies are not that rare ; for @xmath4 their comoving number density to @xmath22 is @xmath23 per @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 , comparable to the number density of @xmath26 galaxies today .",
    "as we will see below , in standard ( @xmath4 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) cdm , halos at @xmath1 with the same abundance as observed lyman - break galaxies have a bias of @xmath29 , substantially lower than the implied galaxy bias .",
    "for @xmath30 the disagreement is less severe , because both the estimated bias and the comoving abundance of observed lyman - break galaxies are lower .",
    "it appeared then from preliminary analyses that our data were consistent with the dark halo model only for @xmath30 ; but it was unclear how seriously to take conclusions based on a single feature in a single field .",
    "moreover other authors soon analyzed the overdensity differently and argued that it was consistent with models in which galaxies are significantly less clustered than we claimed , with @xmath12 low enough to remove the inconsistencies with the abundances for @xmath4 ( e.g. bagla 1997 , governato _ et al . _",

    "we have obtained spectra of 540 objects satisfying the above photometric criteria ; 376 of these have been identified as galaxies ( of which a very small fraction show evidence of agn activity ) , with a redshift distribution shown in figure  1 ; 18 are stars ; and the remainder have not been identified because of inadequate signal to noise ratio . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to the 268 lyman - break galaxies in our six most densely sampled @xmath35  9@xmath369fields , including more complete data in the `` ssa22 '' field analyzed in steidel _",

    "the redshift histograms these six fields are shown in figure  2 ; each field is treated independently in the analysis that follows , although in two cases ( ssa22 and dsf2237 ) pairs of 9fields are adjacent on the plane of the sky .",
    "the strength of clustering can be estimated by placing galaxies into spatial bins ( `` cells '' ) and looking at the fluctuations in galaxy counts from cell to cell .",
    "a convenient measure of the clustering strength is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the galaxies two - point correlation function . if there were large numbers of galaxies in each cell , so that shot noise were negligible , @xmath39 would just be equal to the relative variance of galaxy counts in cells of volume @xmath40 : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the observed and @xmath43 the mean number of galaxies in a cell . in practice shot noise",
    "makes a significant contribution to the variance of cell counts , and this contribution must be removed to estimate @xmath39 : @xmath44 ( peebles 1980 , ",
    "for any cell the expected number of galaxies can be estimated accurately as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is our selection function , determined by fitting a spline to the coarsely binned redshifts of all @xmath47 lyman - break galaxies which satisfy our current color criteria and have redshifts , and @xmath48 is the number of galaxies in the field with redshifts .",
    "( @xmath48 varies from field to field because of differing spectroscopic completeness . ) in general the uncertainty in cell count @xmath42 will dominate the uncertainty in @xmath43 . if we neglect the relatively small uncertainty in @xmath43 , we can estimate @xmath39 from the number of counts @xmath42 in a single cell as @xmath49 if @xmath43 were perfectly known , @xmath50 would have expectation value @xmath51 and variance @xmath52 where we have used results in peebles ( 1980 ,  36 ) and neglected the integrals over the three- and four - point correlation functions . in fact @xmath50 will be a slightly biased estimator of @xmath39 , since our estimate of @xmath43 depends weakly on @xmath42 ( through its contribution to @xmath48 ) , but this bias should be small compared to the variance  which is itself only approximately equal to the rhs of equation 1 . with @xmath50 we can estimate @xmath39 from the observed number of counts in a single cell ; by combining the estimates @xmath50 from every cell in our data with inverse - variance weighting , we arrive at our best estimate of @xmath39 .",
    "( the variance depends on the unknown @xmath39 , of course , but the answer converges with a small number of iterations . )    placing our counts into a dense grid of roughly cubical cells whose transverse size is equal to the field of view ( @xmath35 9 ) , we estimate @xmath53 in cells of approximate length 7.7 , 11.9 , 11.4 @xmath2 mpc for @xmath4 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean of @xmath50 estimated in the fields individually .",
    "this approach with the estimator @xmath50 has the advantage of being relatively model independent , but statisticians have long argued that an optimal data analysis must use the likelihood function ( e.g. birnbaum 1962 ) . if we had a plausible model for the probability density function ( pdf ) of galaxy fluctuations @xmath56 , we might hope to produce a better estimate of @xmath39 by finding the value that maximizes the likelihood of the data .",
    "an exact expression for the galaxy pdf has not been found , but it should be sufficient to use a reasonable approximation .",
    "the main requirement for this approximate pdf is that it be skewed , since a galaxy fluctuation @xmath57 can be arbitrarily large but can not be less than -1 .",
    "a particularly simple distribution with the necessary skew , the lognormal , provides a good fit to the pdf of mass fluctuations and of linearly biased galaxies in n - body simulations ( e.g. coles & jones 1991 , coles & frenk 1991 , kofman _",

    "if the cells are large enough to be nearly uncorrelated , we can find the maximum likelihood value of @xmath39 by maximizing the product of the likelihoods from individual cells .",
    "figure  3 shows the product of the likelihoods for @xmath39 from all cells in all six fields for @xmath4 .",
    "the plots for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are similar , with small differences arising because our desire for cubical cells forces us to use different redshift binning for different cosmologies . for each cosmology",
    "the overall maximum likelihood value is close to @xmath64 ; the 68.3% credible intervals are 0.8 to 1.6 , 0.7 to 1.4 , and 1.1 to 2.1 for @xmath4 , @xmath65  open , and @xmath66  flat , in reasonable agreement with our estimate from @xmath50 .",
    "is very similar to that of peacock ( 1997 ) . ]",
    "we will take the maximum likelihood estimates as our best estimates of @xmath39 hereafter .",
    "a more common measure of the clustering strength is the characteristic length @xmath67 in a correlation function of assumed form @xmath68 . for spherical cells @xmath67 and @xmath39 are related through @xmath69 $ ] ( peebles 1980  59 ) , and so approximating our cubical cells as spheres with equal volume , and assuming @xmath70 , we arrive at a rough estimate of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 comoving @xmath2 mpc for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , @xmath6  flat .",
    "these values are large , comparable to the correlation lengths of massive galaxies today .",
    "the correlation lengths for @xmath4 and @xmath65  open are larger , by about @xmath74 , than those recently derived by giavalisco _",
    "_  ( 1998a , `` g98a '' hereafter ) from the angular clustering of lyman - break galaxies",
    ". this discrepancy could be resolved in several ways .",
    "the correlation lengths would agree at the @xmath75 level if a large fraction of the objects whose spectra we can not identify ( about 25% of the spectroscopic sample ) were lower redshift interlopers diluting the angular clustering signal .",
    "the discrepancy would also be reduced if @xmath76 were larger than 1.8 , although @xmath76 would have to be equal to @xmath77 , contradicting the results of g98a , to make the correlation lengths agree at the @xmath75 level .",
    "because the spectroscopic subsample is somewhat brighter than the sample as a whole , one would expect ( from arguments we develop below ) the galaxies analyzed here to be somewhat more strongly clustered than those analyzed in g98a , but this would change @xmath67 by only @xmath35  10 - 20% ( these numbers follow from the formalism presented below , and will be explained more fully in giavalisco _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998b ) ) . inferring @xmath67 from observed",
    "angular clustering depends upon the assumed cosmological geometry , because ( for example ) projection effects must be corrected , and an intriguing possibility is that the correlation lengths disagree because g98a assumed an incorrect geometry when deriving @xmath67 from the angular clustering . according to g98a , the quantity @xmath78 ( for a correlation function of the assumed form @xmath79 ) is well constrained by their observations .",
    "if we take @xmath78 and @xmath39 as two cosmology - independent parameters fixed by observation ( which is not quite true ; see above ) , then the correlation length derived from @xmath80 scales with cosmological parameters roughly as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the change in proper distance with redshift and @xmath83 is the angular diameter distance , while the correlation length derived from @xmath39 roughly obeys @xmath84 .",
    "the ratio of these correlation lengths therefore depends on the geometry as @xmath85 , and so if we assume @xmath86 and @xmath87 when the correct values are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we will find correlation lengths from counts - in - cell and @xmath80 analyses which differ by a factor @xmath90 . for @xmath70 in an @xmath65  flat cosmology , we would find @xmath91 if we mistakenly assumed @xmath65  open , and @xmath92 if we assumed @xmath4 .",
    "this does not go far towards reconciling the discrepant correlation lengths , but it does suggest an interesting variant of alcock & paczynski s ( 1979 ) classic cosmological test . finally , g98a found differences of 30% in @xmath67 when measuring the angular clustering with different estimators , and this implies that the systematics in that sample may not be fully understood .",
    "while these effects taken together could easily reconcile the results presented here with those of g98a , the differences are significant and will likely only be convincingly resolved by better data . because the largest corrections we have proposed apply to the estimates of @xmath67 from angular clustering",
    ", we will take the counts - in - cell result as our best estimate of the clustering strength in our subsequent discussion .",
    "a large bias for high - redshift galaxies is a prediction of models that associate galaxies with virialized dark matter halos ( e.g. cole & kaiser 1989 ) , and on the face of it the strong clustering of lyman - break galaxies seems a significant success for them .",
    "but these models explain strong clustering by associating high - redshift galaxies with rare events in the underlying lagrangian density field , and would be ruled out if lyman - break galaxies were too common to be so strongly clustered . in this section",
    "we examine the consistency of clustering strength and abundance in more detail ; but before we can do so we need to estimate the lyman - break galaxies bias . our definition of bias is the ratio of rms galaxy fluctuation to rms mass fluctuation in cells of our chosen size : @xmath93 . the mean square mass fluctuation in a cell at @xmath1 can be calculated with a numerical integration : @xmath94 ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) , where @xmath95 is the fourier transform of the cell volume and @xmath96 is the power - spectrum of density fluctuations . by most accounts the shape of the power - spectrum is close to that of a cdm - like model with `` shape parameter '' @xmath10 ( vogeley _ et al . _",
    "1992 , peacock & dodds 1994 , maddox _ et al . _  1996",
    "; we use bardeen _ et al . _",
    "1986 equations g2 and g3 with @xmath97 and an @xmath98 long - wavelength limit as an approximation to the spectral shape ) .",
    "the normalization of the power - spectrum can be determined at @xmath99 from the abundance of x - ray clusters , and on large scales of interest here can be reliably extrapolated back to @xmath100 with linear theory .",
    "one complication prevents us from simply dividing our measured @xmath101 by the calculated @xmath102 to estimate the bias : we have measured the relative variance of galaxy counts in cells defined in redshift space , and this variance is boosted relative to the real - space galaxy variance of interest by coherent infall towards overdensities , and reduced by redshift measurement errors .",
    "km / s to change our estimated bias by @xmath75 . ]",
    "both effects must be corrected before we can estimate the bias .",
    "fortunately neither effect is large for highly biased galaxies in cells of this size , and the correction is straightforward . following peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) , we estimate @xmath12 by numerically inverting @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the adopted uncertainty in a galaxy s position from redshift measurement errors ( see steidel _",
    "et al . _",
    "this expression is a modified version of the usual integral relationship between the variance and the power - spectrum ; the factor of @xmath106 in the integrand accounts for the increase in redshift - space power ( relative to real - space power ) due to coherent infall ( e.g. kaiser 1987 ) , and the gaussian models our redshift uncertainties .",
    "corrections for the non - linear growth of perturbations on scales much smaller than our cell ( described , for example , in the same peacock & dodds reference ) have been neglected .",
    "the results of this bias calculation are shown in figure  4 .",
    "with @xmath107 we find @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , and @xmath6  flat .",
    "this estimate of the bias is inversely proportional to the somewhat - uncertain power - spectrum normalization @xmath11 ; for concreteness we have chosen @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , and @xmath6  flat , close to the cluster normalization of eke , cole , & frenk ( 1996 ) , but our most important conclusions below , about the bias / abundance relationship , are insensitive to the normalization . varying the spectral shape over the plausible range @xmath114  0.10.5 changes our estimate of the bias by about @xmath115  10% for @xmath4 and by a negligible amount for the other cosmologies ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , assuming the @xmath116 dependence of @xmath11 is negligible ( e.g. white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ) .",
    "we can test the idea that lyman - break galaxies form within dark matter halos by comparing their inferred bias to the predicted bias of dark matter halos with similar abundance .",
    "simple statistical arguments ( e.g. kaiser 1984 , mo & white 1996 ) show that the main factor controlling the clustering strength of a population of halos with mass @xmath117 is their `` rareness '' @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the rms relative mass fluctuation in the density field smoothed by a spherical top - hat enclosing average mass @xmath117 , and @xmath120 is the linear overdensity corresponding to spherical collapse . to first order , @xmath121 ( mo & white 1996 ) . the abundance of these same halos is approximately given by the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formula @xmath122 where we have written the halo mass as @xmath123 to emphasize that it depends upon both the halos rareness and the shape of the matter power - spectrum , as discussed below .",
    "this relation is easy to understand : @xmath124 is the maximum possible number density of collapsed objects on mass scale @xmath117 , given the finite average density of the universe @xmath125 , and @xmath126which follows from the assumed gaussian distribution of the linear density field  is the fraction of this maximum number that has just reached the threshold for collapse . from the press - schechter formula",
    "is it clear that the clustering strength of a population of given abundance will depend upon the shape of the power - spectrum : if the fluctuation spectrum has more small - scale power , then the process of collapse will have advanced to larger mass scales , @xmath124 will be smaller , and @xmath127 ( and therefore @xmath12 , by equation 2 ) will also have to be smaller to match the observed abundance .    if we were free to specify the shape of the fluctuation spectrum , then , we could ( almost ) always argue that our observation of a galaxy population with abundance @xmath128 and bias @xmath12 was consistent with the idea that galaxies form within dark matter halos , by simply adjusting the level of small - scale power until halos of abundance @xmath128 were predicted to have bias @xmath12 ; but if we restrict ourselves to spectral shapes that are not grossly inconsistent with local constraints , we find what is summarized in figure  4 .",
    "figure  4 shows the linear bias ( equation 2 ) as a function of spectral shape @xmath116 for dark halos with abundance equal to the observed abundance of lyman - break galaxies . , and no galaxies in halos less massive",
    ", we could determine @xmath129 from the abundance of the galaxies by integrating the press - schechter formula ( equation 3 ) .",
    "in fact the technique is likely to find galaxies in halos less massive than @xmath129 as well as in halos more massive , and so @xmath129 defined this way is perhaps close to the typical halo mass .",
    "the bias shown in figure  4 is for halos of mass @xmath129 , and as such is only an approximation to the bias of the observed population .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment will be presented elsewhere . ] decreasing the amount of small scale power ( i.e. decreasing @xmath116 ) increases the predicted bias of these halos ; the inferred bias of lyman - break galaxies begins to match the predicted bias of dark halos at @xmath10 , the locally favored spectral shape , as would be expected if these galaxies formed within the most massive dark matter halos at @xmath1 . at @xmath107",
    "the number density of lyman - break galaxies implies typical masses of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 for @xmath4 , @xmath65  open , and @xmath66  flat .",
    "though ( in the dark - halo model ) measuring the number density and bias of a population of objects reveals little about cosmology other than the shape of the power - spectrum , measuring in addition the _ masses _ of the objects pins down the spectral normalization and provides a sensitive cosmological probe .",
    "limited near - infrared spectroscopy on lyman - break galaxies ( pettini _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) has so far placed only weak constraints on their masses ; we look forward to the availability of near - ir spectrographs on 8m - class telescopes .    if it is in fact true that lyman - break galaxies form within dark halos , then other conclusions follow from the data .",
    "for example , we have assumed so far that lyman - break galaxies  the brightest @xmath1 galaxies in the rest uv  reside only within the most massive dark halos , but this need not be true ; it is easy to imagine that the galaxies brightest in the uv are those with the least dust , or with the most recent burst of star formation , and that halo mass is only a secondary consideration . in this case",
    "there could be a large spread in the uv luminosities of galaxies within halos of a given mass . because low - mass halos are so much more numerous than high - mass halos , if the spread were large enough our observed sample would be dominated by low - mass halos which happened to be uv bright .",
    "the strong clustering we observe shows that there can not be a large population of low - mass ( and thus weakly clustered ) interlopers in our sample , and this limits the allowed spread in uv luminosities for halos of a given mass .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  4 , showing the bias of halos ten times more abundant than lyman - break galaxies , illustrate the point .",
    "these halos have masses only 4 , 8 , 5 times lower than halos as abundant as lyman - break galaxies for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , @xmath6  flat , but if even 10% of them contained galaxies bright enough to be included in our sample the clustering strength would be diluted to well below what we observe .",
    "the implication is that lower mass halos are fainter in the uv not just on average , but ( nearly ) on a halo - by - halo basis . if lyman break galaxies really were sub - galactic fragments , rapidly fading after bursts of star formation triggered by chance interactions with other fragments ( e.g. lowenthal _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , one might not expect so tight a correlation between uv luminosity and dark halo mass .",
    "similar arguments can be used to undermine the claim that the lyman - break technique misses a large fraction of the galaxies in massive halos at @xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty in the bias is still large , and our analytic approximations rather crude , so it would be premature to make too much of arguments such as these ; but they show the kind of conclusions that can be drawn from our sample in the context of the dark halo model .",
    "these ideas will be developed further elsewhere ( adelberger _ et al . _",
    "we have estimated the variance of lyman - break galaxy counts in cubes of side length 7.7 , 11.9 , 11.4 @xmath2 mpc as @xmath133 for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , @xmath6  flat .",
    "this variance implies that lyman - break galaxies have a bias @xmath93 of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 for the same cosmologies .",
    "the bias is in good agreement with a simple model , first proposed by white & rees ( 1978 ) , in which galaxies form within virialized halos of dark matter .",
    "the agreement of our data with this model depends on cosmology primarily through the shape of the power - spectrum , rather than through the growth rate of matter perturbations as might have been expected .",
    "given the abundance of lyman - break galaxies and the locally determined power - spectrum shape , one could have predicted a priori from this model the clustering strength we have observed .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good , for it assumes not only that galaxies form within dark halos  which is plausible enough  but that galaxies uv - bright enough for us to detect reside almost exclusively within the most massive halos .",
    "uv luminosity depends so strongly on the age of a starburst and on the importance of dust extinction that one might have expected halo mass to play a comparatively minor role in lyman - break galaxies uv luminosities ; but this appears not to be the case .",
    "the observed abundance and clustering properties of lyman - break galaxies suggest instead an almost one - to - one correspondence of massive halos to _ observable _ galaxies , and this implies , for example , that the most massive halos essentially always exhibit star formation at detectable levels ( i.e. , that the duration of star formation is close to the time interval over which the galaxies in the sample are observed ) , and that halos only slightly less massive rarely do . the simple analytic approach adopted in  4 can not justify more precise statements here ; these will be presented elsewhere ( adelberger _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) .",
    "while we have argued that our data can be understood through an appealingly simple model for galaxy formation in which galaxies form within dark - matter halos , the uv luminosity of young galaxies is tightly correlated with their mass , and the power - spectrum of mass fluctuations at @xmath1 has a shape similar to that determined locally , this does not of course rule out other models .",
    "we look forward to learning how well our data agree with competing scenarios for galaxy formation . in the meantime",
    ", one prediction of the scenario we favor is that fainter samples of lyman - break galaxies in the same redshift range should exhibit weaker clustering ; existing data will allow us to test this observationally ( giavalisco _ et al . _",

    "<S> we have measured the counts - in - cells fluctuations of 268 lyman - break galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in six 9@xmath0 9fields at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of galaxy counts in cubes of comoving side length 7.7 , 11.9 , 11.4 @xmath2 mpc is @xmath3 for @xmath4 , @xmath5  open , @xmath6  flat , implying a bias on these scales of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the bias and abundance of lyman - break galaxies are surprisingly consistent with a simple model of structure formation which assumes only that galaxies form within dark matter halos , that lyman - break galaxies rest - uv luminosities are tightly correlated with their dark masses , and that matter fluctuations are gaussian and have a linear power - spectrum shape at @xmath1 similar to that determined locally ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is largely independent of cosmology or spectral normalization @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the masses of lyman - break galaxies would in principle distinguish between different cosmological scenarios . </S>"
