    "previous remote and in - situ measurements have identified a wealth of molecules in titan s atmosphere .",
    "simple and complex hydrocarbons , nitriles and oxygen - bearing species have been detected in surprisingly large abundances , revealing the presence of a complex photo - chemistry that is considered as a possible analogue for the chemistry of the early earth s atmosphere . despite detailed studies of titan s atmosphere by the cassini spacecraft ( reviewed by",
    "* ) , major gaps in our understanding are still present regarding the full chemical inventory and the spatial distributions of titan s chemical species . with its unprecedented combination of high spectral and spatial resolution at high sensitivity ,",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) can obtain detailed measurements of the abundances and distributions of molecules inaccessible to cassini and other ground and space - based instruments , as well as providing ` instantaneous ' maps ( in a matter of minutes ) , of titan s entire earth - facing hemisphere .    recent work on heterodyne millimeter - wave spectroscopy of titan @xcite has proven the utility of high spectral resolution molecular line observations for the derivation of vertical mixing profiles , based on the variation of emission line shapes as a function of altitude . in the troposphere and stratosphere ( at altitudes @xmath7 less than a few hundred kilometers ) , pressure broadening in the high - density gas ( at n@xmath8 number densities @xmath9 @xmath10 ) gives rise to prominent line wings , whereas in the upper atmosphere ( @xmath11  km ) , densities are lower and rotational line profiles are typically dominated by the thermal and bulk motions of the gas , with narrow widths ( fwhm @xmath12  km / s ) .",
    "the hnc molecule was detected in titan s atmosphere for the first time by @xcite , who observed the @xmath13 rotational transition at 544  ghz using the herschel space observatory .",
    "the telescope s angular resolution ( @xmath14 ) was insufficient to spatially resolve the molecular emission , but line profile modeling indicated that the majority of the observed emission originated from hnc at altitudes greater than 400  km .",
    "chemical models show that a likely pathway to hnc production in the ionosphere is from protonation of the abundant hcn molecule , followed by dissociative recombination of electrons with hcnh@xmath15 .",
    "this theory is supported by the detection of hcnh@xmath15 at altitudes 1100 - 1150  km by the cassini inms instrument @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite determined that the reaction h@xmath8cn + h  @xmath16  hnc + h@xmath8 could plausibly explain much of the observed hnc .",
    "production of hnc from the degradation of large molecules and organic polymers / grains is also possible .",
    "measurement of the spatial distribution of hnc is important in order to help constrain photochemical models and test theories regarding the formation and evolution of this molecule on titan .",
    "infrared emission from hc@xmath0n was detected on titan by @xcite .",
    "the first radio measurement of this molecule was by @xcite , who observed the @xmath17 line at 146  ghz using the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "@xcite subsequently measured multiple ( spectrally - resolved ) transitions of hc@xmath0n at 90 - 240  ghz and derived disk - averaged vertical mixing profiles for this molecule up to an altitude of 500  km . the major source of hc@xmath0n on titan is predicted to be from the reaction of the cn radical with c@xmath8h@xmath8 @xcite .    to date ,",
    "the highest published spatial resolution achieved in ground - based observations of molecular emission from titan s atmosphere was @xmath18 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer @xcite .",
    "variations in the hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0cn line profiles over titan s disk were observed , consistent with prograde equatorial wind velocities of @xmath19  ms@xmath20 and @xmath21  ms@xmath20 at altitudes of 300 km ( upper stratosphere ) and 450 km ( lower mesosphere ) , respectively .    here",
    "we present the first spectrally and spatially - resolved observations of sub - mm emission from the hnc and hc@xmath0n molecules in titan s atmosphere using alma , obtained with an angular resolution of approximately @xmath22 .",
    "molecular emission maps and disk - averaged vertical mixing profiles are derived .",
    "observations of titan were made on 2013 november 17 in cycle 1 early science mode as part of an alma director s discretionary time project to observe comet c/2012 s1 ( ison ) ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . to set the flux density scale , a single 158 second integration of titan",
    "was obtained using the dual - sideband band 7 receiver . despite the short integration time ,",
    "alma s excellent sensitivity resulted in spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio , and we have used these data to obtain the results described in this letter .",
    "the correlator was configured to cover four basebands , with frequencies in the range 350.34 - 351.28  ghz and 351.32 - 352.26  ghz ( lower sideband ) , and 362.18 - 363.12  ghz and 363.14 - 364.07  ghz ( upper sideband ) , with 3840 channels per spectral window .",
    "the channel spacing was 244  khz which ( after hanning smoothing by the correlator ) produced a spectral resolution of 488  khz ( or @xmath23  at 363  ghz ) .",
    "weather conditions were excellent , with high atmospheric phase stability , and extremely low precipitable water vapor at zenith ( 0.52  mm ) .",
    "quasar 3c279 was used for bandpass calibration , and titan s strong , compact continuum permitted self - calibration of the phases .",
    "the array was configured to track titan s ephemeris position , updating the coordinates of the phase center in real - time .",
    "the data were flagged and calibrated by the north american alma science center using the standard data reduction scripts and protocols provided by the joint alma observatory .",
    "the flux scale was determined by setting the observed continuum level to match the butler - jpl - horizons 2012 flux model for titan ( see alma memo # 594 ) .",
    "absolute flux calibration is thus expected to be accurate to within 15% .",
    "continuum subtraction and imaging were performed using standard routines in the nrao casa software version 4.2.0 @xcite .",
    "deconvolution ( cleaning ) of the alma point - spread function ( psf ) was performed for each spectral channel using the hogbom algorithm , with natural visibility weighting and a threshold flux level of twice the rms noise .",

    "the images were transformed from celestial coordinates to ( projected ) spatial distances with respect to the center of titan , and spectral coordinates were doppler - shifted to titan s rest frame using the jpl horizons topocentric radial velocity of @xmath28  .",

    "both species show a clear double - peaked structure , with a separation between the peaks of about @xmath33 ( which projects to 4,700  km on the sky , compared to titan s diameter of 5,150  km ) . whereas the hc@xmath0n integrated emission peaks are positioned over titan s poles , the hnc peaks are each offset by 1500 - 2000  km in a clockwise direction in the plane of the sky , about the sub - observer point .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios for the hnc and hc@xmath0n emission peaks are 7.2 and 11 , respectively    spectra for hnc and hc@xmath0n are shown in fig .  [ fig : lines ] , obtained by integrating the observed data cubes over a circular aperture @xmath34 ( 12,000  km ) in diameter , centered on titan .",
    "the average rms noise per channel was 31  mjy for hnc and 38  mjy for hc@xmath0n . whereas the hnc line is quite narrow ( fwhm  @xmath35  ) , and shows negligible deviation from a gaussian profile , the hc@xmath0n line exhibits broad wings , indicative of collisionally - induced ( pressure ) broadening , which suggests significant gas abundance in the lower atmosphere / stratosphere .",
    "the spatially - integrated hnc and hc@xmath0n emission lines were modeled using the nemesis retrieval code @xcite , making use of a recently added line - by - line radiative transfer module .",

    "the lorentzian broadening half - widths at 300  k were assumed to be 1.290 and 0.1  cm@xmath20bar@xmath20 for hnc and hc@xmath0n respectively , with temperature - dependence exponents of 0.69 and 0.75 . using the model temperature / abundance / aerosol profiles , and making the assumption that these profiles do not vary with latitude and longitude",
    ", fluxes were calculated as a function of frequency using a 10-point trapezium - rule integration from the center of the disk to the edge of the model ( at an altitude of 782  km ) .",
    "a two - parameter ` gradient model ' was used for the hnc and hc@xmath0n vertical mixing ratio ( vmr ) profiles , with a variable abundance at reference altitude @xmath37  km , and a variable slope above and below that level , represented as a fraction ( @xmath38 ) of the pressure scale height .",
    "the hc@xmath0n was assumed to condense out at altitudes below @xmath39  km , at which saturation vapor pressure is reached for this molecule . employing a @xmath40 minimization between the modeled and observed spectra ,",
    "the best - fitting abundance at @xmath41 was found to be @xmath42  ppb for hc@xmath0n , and @xmath43  ppb for hnc , with retrieved fractional scale heights of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the vertical column densities of these best - fitting gradient models were @xmath4  @xmath5 for hnc and @xmath6  @xmath5 for hc@xmath0n .",
    "as identified by the herschel hifi observations of @xcite , the narrow hnc emission line indicates no significant contribution from this molecule at altitudes @xmath46  km , so we also modeled hnc using a profile with constant abundance above 400  km and zero below . the resulting ` step model ' fit",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ( upper left panel ; dashed curve ) , and provides a similarly good fit to the spectrum as the gradient model , although the line wings are slightly weaker .",
    "the best - fitting abundance above 400  km was found to be @xmath47  ppb , consistent with the value of @xmath48  ppb obtained by @xcite .",
    "this model is less optically - thick and has a somewhat smaller vertical hnc column density of @xmath49  @xmath5 .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio observations of multiple emission lines could help constrain the true hnc distribution .",
    "the best - fitting vmr profiles derived for hcn and hc@xmath0n are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] . for hc@xmath0n ,",
    "profiles from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are plotted for comparison .",
    "our hc@xmath0n vmr profile is in reasonable agreement with these previous studies , although we identify significantly more hc@xmath0n in the lower stratosphere ( @xmath50 - 200  km ) than @xcite .",
    "in addition to variations in the degree of spatial averaging between the different studies , seasonal and latitudinal variations in the hc@xmath0n abundance distribution can plausibly be responsible for the differences between the observed profiles .",
    "peaks in the integrated hc@xmath0n emission over titan s poles are interpreted as resulting from enhancements in the hc@xmath0n abundance that arise as a consequence of global atmospheric circulation .",
    "cassini cirs observations identified the presence of enhancements in hydrocarbon and nitrile abundances over titan s northern ( winter ) pole during the period 2004 - 2007 @xcite .",
    "these abundance patterns were found to be consistent with the presence of a global south - north circulatory flow ( similar to earth s hadley cells ) , that carries high - altitude photochemical products towards the winter pole . following the august 2009 equinox , the circulation cell began to undergo reversal ( from northern to southern subsidence ) , which manifested as changes in the molecular distribution patterns observed by cirs between 2010 and 2011 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of both a northern and southern polar peak in the hc@xmath0n distribution measured by alma in november 2013 may be interpreted in two ways :    \\(1 ) a recent reversal of the main high - altitude circulation cell could be responsible for transporting hc@xmath0n from its production site in the upper atmosphere towards the south pole , where it becomes concentrated as a result of subsidence .",
    "chemical models have identified a lifetime for hc@xmath0n of @xmath51  yr @xcite .",
    "this calculation is based on conditions near the equator ; chemical lifetimes at the poles may be longer due to the reduced solar insolation , so the northern hc@xmath0n peak can plausibly be a remnant of the hc@xmath0n transported to that region prior to the recent reversal in the global circulation .",
    "if so , a steady decay in the northern hc@xmath0n abundance would be expected over the next few years , measurement of which could provide a quantitative test of hc@xmath0n s chemical lifetime near the pole .",
    "\\(2 ) alternatively , the presence of two circulation cells ( rising near the equator and moving in opposite directions ) may be possible during the seasonal transition period ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "such flows could carry photochemical products ( including hc@xmath0n ) from the upper atmosphere towards both poles simultaneously .",
    "observations of variations in the hc@xmath0n distribution over the course of titan s seasonal cycle ( for example , covering the completion of the transition from northern spring to the summer solstice in 2017 ) could help determine the origin of the observed structures and provide new insight into titan s global circulation patterns .",
    "similar to hc@xmath0n , hnc also shows a clear double - peaked structure .",
    "however , in contrast to hc@xmath0n , the observed hnc peaks are not aligned with titan s polar axis , but are offset clockwise by @xmath52 in the plane of the sky .",
    "these offsets imply longitudinal and latitudinal variations in the hnc distribution / excitation that are not readily explainable in the current paradigm of chemical and circulation models , which typically possess longitudinal symmetry .",
    "it seems contrived to postulate enhanced hnc production and/or reduced destruction rates at specific latitudes and longitudes , or the presence of a peculiar hnc circulation system that concentrates this molecule at the observed positions .",
    "titan s super - rotating zonal winds ( with speeds @xmath53",
    "ms@xmath20 at 450  km altitude ; @xcite ) , should result in longitudinal mixing of the atmosphere on a timescale of about 45  hr , which renders diurnal chemical differentiation an unlikely explanation for the observed structures , given titan s 382  hr day length .",
    "variations in the atmospheric temperature profile as a function of longitude could plausibly introduce corresponding changes in the hnc excitation and thus , the spectral line intensity , but the origin of such asymmetrical variations across titan s disk presents a challenge for our current understanding .",
    "variability in the locations of peak hc@xmath0n emission with altitude may assist in the interpretation of the mysterious hnc distribution . due to the variation in",
    "line pressure - broadening as a function of altitude , maps can be constructed of the hc@xmath0n emission as a function of altitude . as demonstrated by @xcite",
    " see their fig . 1  the hc@xmath0n @xmath54 line wings ( at frequencies @xmath55  mhz , or @xmath56  from line - center ) , trace gas at low altitudes ( @xmath57  km ) , whereas the line core traces gas at @xmath58  km . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corewings]a , we present maps of the hc@xmath0n line flux integrated over ( a ) just the line core ( @xmath59 to 0.5  ) and ( b ) just the line wings ( 2.0 to 5.0  either side of the line center ) .",
    "given that the low - altitude hc@xmath0n distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corewings]b ) , as well as the total integrated hc@xmath0n flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] ) are relatively symmetric about titan s polar axis , the asymmetry in the hc@xmath0n distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : corewings]a ( in which a line through the hc@xmath0n peaks is tilted clockwise by about @xmath60 with respect to the poles ) implies that the emission from high - altitude hc@xmath0n ( at @xmath3  km ) must be offset from the poles in a similar way to the hnc .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that the asymmetrical hnc distribution results from a process that becomes important only in the mesosphere and above .",
    "the fact that the emission maps for these two chemically - distinct species are affected in a similar way implies that the observed structures are more likely the result of a physical phenomenon such as temperature or atmospheric dynamics , rather than a consequence of atmospheric chemistry .",
    "we report the first detections of molecular emission from titan s atmosphere using alma and present spatially - resolved maps of emission from hnc and hc@xmath0n .",
    "these maps show remarkable double - lobed structures for both molecules , with clear concentrations of hc@xmath0n at low altitude ( @xmath57  km ) over titan s north and south poles , whereas the hnc and high - altitude hc@xmath0n emission are offset from the poles by 20 - 45@xmath61 in a clockwise direction .",
    "disk - averaged atmospheric emission models that take into account the shapes of the resolved spectral line profiles confirm the result of @xcite that hnc is predominantly confined to altitudes @xmath62  km .",
    "similar to previous radio and infrared studies , hc@xmath0n is shown to be abundant at altitudes 70 - 500  km , with a vmr profile that increases with altitude up to at least 500  km .",
    "these maps provide the most striking example to - date of longitudinally asymmetric molecular emission in titan s mesosphere .",
    "the implied longitudinal anisotropies present a challenge for current understanding of titan s atmospheric structure and circulation , and indicate that the mesosphere may be more longitudinally - variable than previously thought .",
    "this study demonstrates alma s unique ability to perform spatially and spectrally - resolved measurements of molecular emission from the atmospheres of solar system bodies . using less than three minutes of observational data",
    ", our results also highlight the extremely high sensitivity of alma , even in early science mode .",
    "future interferometric observations of titan s atmosphere at higher angular resolution and with improved sensitivity will provide new insights into its structure , composition and dynamics , which are expected to facilitate our understanding of the complex interplay between photochemistry and circulation in planetary atmospheres , with applications within our solar system and beyond .    this research was supported by nasa s planetary atmospheres , planetary astronomy and astrobiology programs , by the leverhulme trust and the uk science and technology facilities council .",
