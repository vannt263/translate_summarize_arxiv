    "fluctuations and correlations in complex system provide unique information about its stability , scales and ranges of interactions between its constituents , and about qualitative changes in the system as a whole , as e.g. in phase transitions . studied at the microscopic level , such phenomena affect random variables on the phase space and , in particular , their local properties reflected in shapes or structure of singularities of their distributions . on the other hand",
    ", they also influence global characteristics of the system , usually seen in moments of random variables .",
    "typical examples are relations between scales of correlations or strengths of intermittency and behaviour of thermodynamic potentials and quantities directly derivable from them , in particular thermal susceptibilities connected to variances of extensive variables , as specific heats or compressibilities .    the structure of the phase space can be studied using different formal tools .",
    "interesting from the physical point of view are links between mathematical properties of random variables on the phase space and observables for the system , either global , as e.g. moments of variables representing the system as a whole , or local , as characteristics of the phase space subsets related to subsystems . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we found relations between equilibrium thermodynamics and the measure of the uniformity of the phase space , the latter being originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of multifractal sets and formulated in terms of generalized entropies or fractal dimensions . in particular , we expressed the uniformity through thermodynamic potentials in the framework of the canonical and the grand canonical ensambles and proposed such approach for estimation of phase proportions in the vicinity of critical points .    in the following paper",
    "we develop the idea further and show how the uniformity of the phase space , being itself sensitive to local properties of the measure , can be used for direct calculation of first moments of such phenomenological global random variables as the total energy or the number of particles in the system .",
    "we also show that the control parameter of the uniformity is at the same time the scaling parameter for intensive variables , as the temperature and the chemical potential , thus offering better understanding of relations between properties of complex systems at different scales .",
    "basic assumption for both the previous @xcite and the present works is that the system is in its stationary state , normally thermal equilibrium , or not far from it , which means that the probability densities are constant in time or quasistatic and the concept of temperature as a non - random parameter does make sense .",
    "apart from obvious interest in finding phenomenological interpretation for purely theoretical concept of the uniformity , our motivation for such effort is driven by experimental practice . in many situations ,",
    "one reasonably believes that stationarity conditions are fulfiled and probability densities can be estimated from data samples , but the equilibrium temperature of the system is unknown and hardly measurable directly .",
    "good examples for that are sets of remnants of nuclear disassembly processes in high energy collisions or that of stellar evolution where parts of final states are not detected or even not detectable at all because of experimental limitations , as hardly detectable neutrinos or objects out of aparatus acceptance . since the formalism can be applied to wider class of systems and phenomena , as e.g. to analyses of transportation networks or finance markets , for such cases parameters corresponding to the temperature or chemical potential",
    "do not even have clear operational interpretation and are not measurable just because are not observables _",
    "as can be seen below , using uniformity one can predict the temperature evolution of the system from data taken at unknown temperature and eventually determine the temperature from the shape of the curve .",
    "in addition , the uniformity function is parametrized by the real number which controls its sensitivity to different regions of the phase space , thus using experimentally available information in the most efficient way .",
    "following a. renyi @xcite we introduce generalized entropies @xmath0 , parametrized by the real number @xmath1 @xmath2 where the phase space is divided into @xmath3 numbered cells , @xmath4 , of the same volume @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 being the measure .",

    "although for both the renyi and tsallis entropies the @xmath1 contributes via terms @xmath38 , thus making them both sensitive to frequent or non - frequent events on the phase space , depending on the value of @xmath1 , but the properties and physical meaning of them are quite different .",
    "for random variables represented by non - singular and smooth probability density functions , their renyi dimensions do not depend on @xmath1 and the uniformity is equal to 1 .",
    "this is normally the case when the random variable represents total number of particles in the system .",

    "has to consider densities being themselves random variables and dependent on the phase space random variables @xmath63 , as e.g. invariant density @xmath64 for which @xmath10 does exhibit non - trivial dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , for finite statistics one can not calculate directly an exact value of @xmath10 and has to use an estimator for it .",
