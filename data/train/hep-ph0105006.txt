    "the mode @xmath1 has been the subject of intense study both as a test of chiral perturbation theory @xcite and as the source of a cp - conserving amplitude for @xmath4 @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has been known since the first experimental results appeared @xcite that lowest order ( @xmath5 ) chiral perturbation theory is not sufficient to explain simultaneously the observed rate and spectrum . for some time now , it has become standard to use a theoretical description which incorporates certain non - analytic terms at next to leading order ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , as well as one parameter , @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the parameterization of the amplitudes for @xmath10 in terms of @xmath2 alone has been retained in the literature . in this paper",
    "we wish to point out that this is insufficient if one wants to extract a model independent bound on the cp - conserving component of @xmath11 from experiment .",
    "this is something which should be considered by the forthcoming experimental analyses of the mode @xmath1 by the ktev and na48 collaborations . within the framework of chiral perturbation theory",
    "the new data should be analyzed in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the issue of whether vector mesons dominate this decay mode is an experimental question , and should _ not _ be an input in the analysis of data . as a further motivation for the more general fit ,",
    "we show in this paper that there exists known physics , the @xmath12 , which affects the @xmath1 amplitude at a level comparable to that of vector mesons , and which can not be parameterized in terms of the single constant @xmath2",
    ". it should be no surprise that the @xmath12 can play an important role in this decay mode , given its prominence in the reaction @xmath13 @xcite .    of particular importance",
    "is the determination of the cp - conserving contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "this contribution is completely dominated by one of the two amplitudes present in @xmath1 .",

    "for this reason an accurate determination of both amplitudes is crucial .",

    "in addition to the vector meson exchange contributions , the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 may receive contributions from the exchange of scalar and tensor resonances .",
    "the effect of scalar resonances near 1 gev has been found to be small @xcite , and we include it here for completeness . moreover , we sidestep the issue of a possible scalar resonance in the vicinity of 500  mev because the physics of this broad enhancement in the @xmath67 @xmath68 scattering amplitude is , to a large extent , already included in the treatment of the pion loops .",
    "we concentrate instead in resonances near 1  gev such as the @xmath69 , and take the simplest form for the scalar - pion and scalar - photon interactions @xcite ( we use @xmath70 as in the notation of gasser and leutwyler @xcite ) : @xmath71 we have not included a coupling of the scalar field proportional to light quark masses because it does not contribute to @xmath1 , and because there is not enough experimental information on scalar - meson decays to extract it .",
