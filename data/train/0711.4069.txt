    "percolation @xcite is one of the most - fundamental problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "many phase transitions in physical systems can be explained in terms of a percolation transition .",
    "the pivotal property of percolation is connectivity .",
    "one can describe this in terms of weighted graphs ( often also called networks ) with nonzero or zero weights , corresponding to occupied / connected or unoccupied / disconnected edges . here , we extend the problem to negative weights , in particular we study bond percolation . as an example",
    ", one can imagine an agent traveling on a graph , who has , when traversing an edge , either to pay some resource ( positive weight ) or he is able ( once ) to harvest some resource ( negative weight ) .",
    "paths including negative edge weights also appear in the context of domain walls in random - bond ising systems @xcite .",
    "one percolation problem is whether there exists a path ( or loop ) spanning the full system with negative total weight , such that each edge is traversed at most once .",
    "hence , the percolating objects are paths and it is sufficient to look for minimum - weighted ( or `` shortest '' ) paths ( mwps ) .",
    "percolation properties of string - like objects have been studied occasionally @xcite , but to our knowledge never allowing for negative weights .",
    "one realizes immediately that the negative weights lead to properties which are fundamentally different from conventional percolation .",
    "e.g. , negative - weight percolation ( nwp ) lacks transitivity : if there is a valid ( negative - weight ) path @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 via @xmath3 , it is possible that the path @xmath4 is not valid , as for the paths @xmath5/@xmath6 in figure [ fig : example ] .",
    "hence , there is no simple definition of percolation clusters in this case .",
    "note that , since strings are thus considered , several percolating strings or loops might coexist in the same sample .",
    "this we observe indeed , see below .    here",
    ", we study nwp numerically .",
    "first we introduce the model .",
    "then we outline the algorithm to obtain mwps , since no standard shortest - path algorithm can be used .",
    "the results for different types of two- ( @xmath7 ) and three - dimensional ( @xmath8 ) systems , in particular the critical exponents describing the percolation transitions , show that nwp is fundamentally different compared to conventional percolation and from previous models with string - like percolation .",
    "thus , the study of percolation models exhibiting negative weights might lead to many new insights concerning the behavior of disordered systems .    ,",
    "6 with positive and negative edge weights ( numbers at lines ) .",
    "numbers in black boxes denote the total weight of the minimum - weighted path from node 0 to the corresponding node .",
    "[ fig : example ] ]",
    "we consider @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattice graphs @xmath9 with side length @xmath10 , where adjacent sites @xmath11 are joined by undirected edges @xmath12 .",
    "weights @xmath13 are associated with the edges , representing quenched random variables .",
    "we consider either bimodal ( @xmath14j ) or `` gaussian - like '' ( gl ) distribution of the edge weights , where @xmath15 denotes the fraction of negative or gaussian - distributed edge weights , respectively , among edges with unit weight ( fraction @xmath16 ) .",
    "the bimodal weights are taken to be @xmath17 and the gaussian weights have zero mean and unit width .",
    "these weight distributions explicitly allow for loops @xmath18 with negative weight , given by @xmath19 . for any non - zero value of @xmath15",
    ", a sufficiently large systems will exhibit at least small loops with negative total weight .",
    "we investigate ( i ) mwps in the presence of negative weighted loops on square lattices with periodic boundary conditions ( bcs ) in one and free bcs in the other direction .",
    "the path ends are allowed to terminate on the free boundaries .",
    "further , we study ( ii ) minimum - weighted configurations of negative - weighted loops on square , @xmath7 hexagonal and cubic lattices with fully periodic bcs , see figure [ fig : samples ] . in either case we find critical values of @xmath15 above which ( i ) negative - weight paths appear that span the lattice across the direction with periodic bcs or ( ii ) percolating loops emerge , that span the lattice along some direction .    ,",

    "[ fig : samples],title=\"fig : \" ]    since we are looking for mwps on undirected graphs in the presence of negative weights , traditional `` shortest path '' algorithms can not be applied .",
    "the reason is that for applying these traditional algorithms a special condition must hold : for the distance @xmath22 of any shortest path from a source @xmath23 to @xmath24 , @xmath25 holds , where @xmath26 denotes the set of neighbors of @xmath27 .",
    "this equation is not fulfilled in our case , as can be seen from figure [ fig : example ] for node @xmath28 .",
    "it has minimum distance @xmath29 to node @xmath23 , but it is connected to node 5 via an edge of weight @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "hence , a different approach has to be applied .",
    "we determine mwps and loop configurations through an appropriate transformation of the original graph , detailed in @xcite , and obtaining a minimum - weighted perfect matching ( mwpm ) @xcite , by using exact combinatorial optimization algorithms .    here",
    "we give a concise description of the mapping , pictured as 3-step procedure illustrated in figure [ fig : alg ] :    \\(1 ) each edge , joining 2 sites on @xmath32 , is replaced by a path of 3 edges .",
    "therefore , 2 `` additional '' sites have to be introduced for each edge of @xmath32 .",
    "the original sites are then `` duplicated '' along with their incident edges .",
    "for each of these pairs of of duplicated sites , one additional edge is added that connect the two sites of a pair .",
    "the resulting auxiliary graph @xmath33 is depicted in figure [ fig : alg](b ) , where additional sites appear as squares and duplicated sites as circles .",
    "figure [ fig : alg](b ) also illustrates the weight assignment on @xmath33 .",
    "a more extensive description can be found in @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) a mwpm on the auxiliary graph is determined @xcite .",
    "a mwpm is a minimum - weighted subset @xmath34 of the edges contained in @xmath35 , such that each site of @xmath35 is met by one edge in @xmath34 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : alg](c ) , where the bold edges represent @xmath34 for the given weight assignment .",
    "the dashed edges are unmatched .",
    "due to construction , the auxiliary graph consists of an even number of sites and since there are no isolated sites , it is guaranteed that a perfect matching exists .",
    "\\(3 ) finally it is possible to find a relation between the matched edges @xmath34 on @xmath35 and a configuration of negative - weighted loops @xmath36 on @xmath32 by tracing the steps of the transformation ( 1 ) back .",
    "note that each edge contained in @xmath34 that connects an additional site ( square ) to a duplicated site ( circle ) corresponds to an edge on @xmath32 that is part of a loop , see figure [ fig : alg](d ) .",
    "more precise , there are always two such edges in @xmath34 that correspond to one edge on @xmath32 .",
    "all the edges in @xmath34 that connect like sites ( i.e.  duplicated - duplicated , or additional - additional ) carry zero weight and do not contribute to a loop on @xmath32 . afterwards a depht - first search can be used to explore @xmath36 and to determine the properties of the individual loops . for the weight assignment in figure [ fig : alg](a ) , there is only one loop with weight @xmath37 and length @xmath38 .",
    "note that the result of the calculation is a collection @xmath36 of loops ( and one path for ( i ) , see below ) , such that the total loop weight is minimized .",
    "hence , one obtains a global collective optimum of the system .",
    "clearly , all loops that contribute to @xmath36 possess a negative weight .",
    "note that @xmath36 can be empty and that sub paths are neither allowed to intersect nor to terminate at some site within the lattice .",
    "so as to induce a mwp , as in problem ( i ) , special care is needed .",
    "we have to allow the paths explicitly to terminate at a certain node .",
    "therefore , two extra sites are introduced to the graph .",
    "one extra site is connected to each of the free boundaries by adding edges with weight zero to the transformed graph that join the site with the sites of the respecting boundary .",
    "any subsequent mwpm will contain a path of minimal weight , joining the extra sites .",
    "this does not necessary coincide with the `` shortest '' path , as explained above , but yields the minimal - weighted path in the presence of negative weighted loops . in contrast to the loops , mwps can carry a positive weight in principle , but , as we will see , this will not be the case close to and beyond the percolation transition we are interested in .     with edge weights ,",

    "[ fig : path_nu ] ]",
    "within this problem , the aforementioned collection @xmath36 consists of a set of loops , which might be empty , and a mwp spanning the lattice between the free boundaries .",
    "since the mwp is anyway of @xmath47 in the vertical direction by construction , we call the path percolating , if its projection on the horizontal axis ( i.e.  its _ roughness _",
    "@xmath48 ) covers the full systems .",
    "we studied @xmath7 lattices with @xmath14j disorder and sampled over up to @xmath49 realizations of the disorder to perform averages , subsequently denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "firstly , we investigate the percolation probability . for a very small fraction @xmath15 of negative edge weights ,",
    "the path will cross the lattice in a rather direct fashion , since overhangs are likely to increase the weight of the path and hence the weight of the whole configuration @xmath36 .",

    "a data collapse , obtained using the method described in @xcite , yields @xmath21 and @xmath39 as listed in table [ tab : crit_exp ] with a `` quality '' @xmath54 of the scaling assumption .",
    "we want to point out that the value of @xmath39 found here is clearly distinct from the value @xmath55 of conventional bond percolation , that would give a much worse quality of @xmath56 ( see also figure [ fig : path_nu](b ) ) .",
    "note that many negative weights are needed to allow the mwp to percolate . and",
    "indeed , the path weight becomes negative above @xmath57 with a probability that approaches unity quickly .",
    "therein , the finite - size behavior is described by an exponent @xmath58 consistent with the value @xmath39 stated above , see figure [ fig : path_nu ] .    further note that @xmath59 even for large @xmath15 , where the spanning probability seems to saturate slightly above @xmath60 .",
    "the reason is , as already mentioned , that we actually do not optimize the length of a single path but the weight of the whole configuration @xmath36 .",
    "however , this behavior is clearly distinct from conventional percolation theory .",
    "next , we consider the probability @xmath61 that a bond belongs to the path , where @xmath62 is the mean path length .",
    "it exhibits the finite - size scaling behavior @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath40 signifies the percolation strength @xcite . here , we fixed @xmath21 and @xmath39 as obtained above and determined the value of @xmath40 ( @xmath64 ) listed in table [ tab : crit_exp ] .",
    "adjusting all three parameters in the above scaling assumption yields @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 with a quality @xmath68 .",
    "note that the values agree within the errorbars .",
    "we also determined some quantities ( see also table [ tab : crit_exp ] ) just at @xmath69 with additional simulations up to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 samples ) .",
    "we studied the associated finite - size susceptibility @xmath72 .",
    "its finite size - scaling at @xmath21 can be described using the exponent @xmath41 via @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , the mean path length shows the critical behavior @xmath74 , where @xmath43 denotes the fractal exponent of the paths .",
    "here , calculations at @xmath65 would result in a slightly smaller value of @xmath43 .",
    "we further find the roughness exponent @xmath75 from @xmath76 to be compatible with unity .",
    "note that the obtained exponents satisfy the scaling relations @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we also measured the mean path weight @xmath79 at the percolation point @xmath21 and found that @xmath80 for @xmath81 seems to hold .    we can further probe @xmath36 to not only investigate the mwp but to yield exponents that describe the small loops .",
    "a detailed study of the scaling behavior ( length @xmath82 as function of the spanning length @xmath83 , not shown here ) at @xmath21 shows that they seem within error bars to exhibit _ the same _ fractal dimension @xmath84 as the mwps .",
    "the loops also exhibit a mean ( negative ) weight that increases linearly with the loop length @xmath82 .",
    "further , one expects the distribution @xmath85 of loop lengths @xmath82 to exhibit an algebraic scaling @xmath86 , where @xmath42 signifies the fisher exponent . here , finite - size effects and the presence of the path lead to a suppression of large loops and thus to a deviation from the expected scaling behavior already for rather small values of @xmath82 . in this question",
    ", we find a most reliable value @xmath42 if we account for corrections to scaling via @xmath87 , see table [ tab : crit_exp ] and inset of figure [ fig : len_distrib ] . in principle , at criticality , the fisher exponent and fractal dimension are related through the scaling relation @xmath88 .",
    "this would lead us to expect @xmath89 .    finally , in @xmath7 we can associate a cluster with each loop .",
    "the respective volume @xmath90 is measured as the number of enclosed plaquettes .",
    "it scales as @xmath91 with @xmath92 , revealing the compact nature of the loops interior .",
    "here , we studied @xmath7 ( hex , @xmath8 ) lattices with size up to @xmath93 ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) samples .",
    "first , we analyze the largest loop for a given realization of the disorder .",
    "we find the linear extensions of the loops by projecting it onto all perpendicular axes .",
    "a loop is said to span the lattice , if its projection completely covers at least one axis . from the probability @xmath99 that a loop spans the lattice we estimate @xmath21 and @xmath39 listed in table [ tab : crit_exp ] .",
    "the qualities of the scaling law were found to be @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "further , it is interesting to note that the mean number of spanning loops @xmath104 satisfies a similar scaling relation as the percolation probability , see figure [ fig : loops_2d](a ) , governed by the same values for @xmath21 and @xmath39 as @xmath99 . in either case",
    "we find @xmath105 for large values of @xmath15 , as mentioned already in the introduction , see also @xcite .",
    "as above , the probability @xmath106 that an edge belongs to the percolating loop can be used to determine the exponent @xmath40 , see figure [ fig : loops_2d](b ) and table [ tab : crit_exp ] . herein , the qualities of the scaling law were @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "interestingly , the values of @xmath21 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the @xmath7 loops with @xmath14j disorder are reasonable close to those of the @xmath7 random - bond ising model with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this probably means that the @xmath7 ferromagnet to spin glass transition at @xmath114 can be explained in terms of a percolation transition in the following way : for a spin glass , one starts with a ferromagnetic configuration and searches for loops in the dual lattice with negative weight .",
    "these loops correspond to clusters of spins , which can be flipped to decrease the energy . if these loops are small , i.e. not percolating , the ground state is ferromagnetic , otherwise the ground state exhibits spin - glass order .",
    "a different argument relating this transition to a percolation transition was also briefly mentioned in a study , which focuses on the critical slowing down of polynomial - time algorithms at @xmath114 phase transitions @xcite .",
    "right at @xmath21 we studied @xmath7 ( hex , @xmath8 ) systems up to @xmath115 ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) with @xmath118 ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) samples . for the @xmath7 systems we found @xmath41 listed in table [ tab : crit_exp ] with qualities @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in @xmath8",
    ", due to the very small percolation probability @xmath124 at @xmath21 our results are less clear .",
    "hence , we can draw no final conclusions for that case .",
    "regarding the fractal dimension , spanning loops and the non - spanning loops exhibit within error bars the same exponents @xmath125 in @xmath7 ( values of @xmath43 listed in table [ tab : crit_exp ] ) . as in the mwp case ,",
    "the non - spanning loops are compact ( @xmath126 ) . on the other hand , in @xmath8 , we find @xmath127 different from @xmath128 .    also regarding the mean weight @xmath129 for given length @xmath82 , we find in @xmath7 that spanning and non - spanning loops exhibit both @xmath130 ( i.e. @xmath131 for the spanning loops ) , while in @xmath8 the quality of the data is again not sufficient to observe a clear power law .",
    "gl loops : the main plot shows the average number of dual adjustments per site for different system sizes @xmath10 and the inset illustrates the associated finite - size susceptibility .",
    "[ fig : performance ] ]    the distribution of loop - lengths , excluding the truly spanning loops , is in @xmath7 in good agreement with a power - law decay @xmath86 , see figure [ fig : len_distrib ] and table [ tab : crit_exp ] . in @xmath8",
    "we find again strong finite size effects and hence a most reliable estimate of @xmath42 using a scaling form @xmath87 .",
    "finally , we address the performance of the algorithm .",
    "we doe not want to measure the running time in terms of cpu minutes , since this is machine dependent and is also influenced by external factors like which other processes are running .",
    "hence , we have to look at the algorithm more closely . so as to determine a minimum - weight perfect matching , the algorithm attempts to find an optimal solution to an associated _ dual _ problem @xcite .",
    "therein , the basic task of the algorithm is to find _ augmenting _ paths that improve the solution to the latter .",
    "while executing , the solution to the dual problem is adjusted several times . as a measure for the algorithm performance we consider the number @xmath132 of such adjustment operations , until the algorithm terminates .",
    "figure [ fig : performance ] shows the average number of these operations per lattice site @xmath133 for the case of a gaussian - like distribution of the edge weights .",
    "the value of @xmath134 increases with increasing @xmath15 and curves for different system sizes deviate from each other as the critical point is approached from below . at @xmath21",
    "it scales like @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , the corresponding susceptibility @xmath136 , i.e.the fluctuations of the @xmath137 , diverges at the critical point where is scales as @xmath138 , as can be seen from the inset of figure [ fig : performance ] . for the case of a @xmath14j distribution of the edge weights",
    ", we found similar but slightly different results ( not depicted ) : here , data sets that describe the scaling of @xmath134 for different system sizes , fall onto one universal curve everywhere .",
    "this holds also for @xmath136 , which is peaked slightly below the critical point at @xmath139 .",
    "we have introduced a percolation problem , where edge weights with possibly negative values are attached to the edges .",
    "a system is called percolating if spanning loops or paths of negative weight exist . hence , this model might be fundamentally different from classical percolation problems .",
    "we studied systems in @xmath7 and @xmath8 up to large system sizes . in all cases ,",
    "the universality class is indeed clearly different from standard bond / site percolation .",
    "further , the values of the fractal exponents obtained for the paths / loops differ from those reported in the context of shortest paths or hulls of percolation clusters , so far . nevertheless , the numerical values for the exponents found here are close to those of disorder - induced single defects ( @xmath140 ) and multiple defects ( @xmath141 ) in a @xmath7 elastic medium at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "we observe universality in @xmath7 , hence the properties are independent of the type of weight distribution , lattice geometry and the same for loops or paths",
    ". we also studied ( not shown here ) a related problem , where the loops are allowed to intersect .",
    "the corresponding mapping was recently used in a different context to determine extended ground states of ising spin glasses @xcite .",
    "we found again the same critical exponents . on the other hand",
    ", we observe in @xmath7 the same behavior as for the @xmath114 ferromagnet to spin glass transition for the random - bond ising model , hence this physical transition can be probably explained by a percolation transition in the spirit of the model we have introduced here .",
    "hence , studying percolation problems with negative weights and similar generalizations might be a key approach to describe many yet not well - understood phase transitions in terms of percolation transitions .",
