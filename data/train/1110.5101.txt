    "in one way or another any two - level system ( qubit ) is coupled to some environmental degrees of freedom . this inevitable system - environment coupling leads to decoherence . to protect quantum coherence as a key resource for quantum technologies ,",
    "many schemes have been proposed to dynamically eliminate the unwanted qubit - environment coupling  @xcite .",
    "analogous to the spin - echo technique widely adopted in nuclear - magnetic - resonance studies  @xcite , various dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequences of instantaneous control pulses  @xcite have been extensively studied . in particular , due to uhrig s dd ( udd ) sequence  @xcite , research activities focusing on dd have surged recently  @xcite .",
    "in addition to its high efficiency in theory , the power of udd lies in its universality  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "the working mechanism of udd does not rely on detailed assumptions about the system - environment coupling or about the environment .",
    "nevertheless , if the actual form of the noise spectrum of the environment is available , then a locally optimized dd ( lodd ) @xcite sequence based on the noise spectrum can outperform udd , with the pulse locations optimized according to an exact decoherence function  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the success of optimization is simple . in suppressing the pure - dephasing of a qubit",
    ", a udd sequence minimizes a decoherence filter function ( defined later ) in the neighborhood of zero frequency but gradually becomes less effective for large frequencies . as such ,",
    "if the noise spectrum of the environment is known , then its actual behavior at appreciably nonzero frequencies makes room for further optimization of dd sequences .",
    "this optimization approach is somewhat in the same spirit of the continuous dd approach  @xcite , insofar as both attempt to make the full use of the noise spectrum .",
    "extension of dd to two - qubit ( or even multi - qubit ) systems is crucial towards efficient protection of quantum entanglement . for a known initial state of a two - qubit system ,",
    "an extended udd sequence is found by involving nonlocal control operators , with its theoretical performance essentially identical with that in one - qubit udd cases  @xcite . for general situations , nested - udd sequences ,",
    "initially proposed for suppressing both dephasing and relaxation in one - qubit systems  @xcite , are advocated to protect two - qubit states in a universal manner , i.e. , without knowing the details of the system - environment coupling or of the noise spectrum  @xcite .",
    "for example , it was shown that to lock an unknown superposition state of two known basis states to the @xmath1th order , three layers of udd sequences and hence about @xmath2 control pulses in total will be needed  @xcite . if the initial state is totally unknown , then to reach the same level of decoherence suppression one needs four layers of udd sequences and hence about @xmath3 control pulses  @xcite .",
    "one important question then arises .",
    "that is , if the noise spectrum of the environment of a two - qubit system is available , then can we significantly improve entanglement protection by further optimizing the locations of the instantaneous control pulses as what was done in @xcite for single - qubit systems ?",
    "if yes , then the required number of pulses can be much less and more understandings of entanglement protection might emerge . using an approach extended from the above - mentioned lodd for single - qubit systems ,",
    "this question is answered here via a pure dephasing model of an open two - qubit system .",
    "the performance of optimized dd sequences in preserving two - qubit states is compared with that achieved by nested - udd , for several different types of noise spectrum . except for the lorentzian type of noise spectrum",
    ", it is found that optimized dd sequences can protect two - qubit states orders of magnitude better than nested - udd . as a result , on the one hand nested - udd can be seen as a powerful and a general - purpose scheme for protecting two - qubit states , and on the other hand the optimized dd approach can be seen as system - specific dd schemes with even better performance .",
    "in addition , to shed more light on a recent experiment of entanglement protection via dd  @xcite , a two - qubit system that shares important noise features with the experiment is studied .",
    "our plan for this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a model that describes pure dephasing processes of a two - qubit system in the presence of instantaneous @xmath0 pulses . based on exact expressions of decoherence effects ,",
    "we elaborate in sec .",
    "iii our optimization procedure to find the optimized pulse locations . in sec .",
    "iv , the performance of optimized two - qubit dd sequence is illustrated in four subsections treating different types of noise spectrum .",
    "v concludes this work and proposes two types of experiments .",
    "in general , decoherence as a complicated process involves both population relaxation and dephasing . yet",
    ", if we increase the strength of an external polarization field such that all the energy level splittings are sufficiently large , then the relaxation can be made negligible within a time scale of interest and dephasing becomes the only source of decoherence .",
    "under such a pure dephasing assumption , the environmental noise may be modeled as classical random fields causing random phase shifts , a valid treatment in many dephasing environments like spin bath in solid - state systems @xcite and background noise in superconducting qubits @xcite . here",
    "we follow the methodology proposed in @xcite .",
    "we can then write the pure - dephasing hamiltonian of an open two - qubit system as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are assumed to be independent random noise variables with a gaussian distribution .",
    "we further assume @xmath6 with the correlation function @xmath7 being an even function .",
    "the @xmath8 [ @xmath9 term in the hamiltonian depicts the noise seen by the first ( second ) qubit alone ; whereas the @xmath10 term reflects how noise may jointly impact the two qubits . in the following we loosely call the @xmath10 noise term as a term of nonlocal noise .",
    "if the two qubits are far apart , then this nonlocal noise term should be very small and can be neglected . as a consequence",
    "the decoherence control problem is expected to share important features with single - qubit dd  @xcite ( note that @xmath8 and @xmath11 are assumed to be independent here ) .",
    "however , of our concern in this study are two nearby qubits interacting with each other , and therefore the nonlocal noise term should be included to account for random fluctuations in the qubit - qubit mutual interaction ( for example , due to the fluctuations in qubit - qubit distance caused by lattice vibrations , or in the context of super - conducting qubits  @xcite , due to the fluctuations in a third device that is responsible for qubit - qubit coupling ) .",
    "certainly , in a more realistic environment the @xmath10 term might be correlated with the local noise terms .",
    "such kind of potential correlations are neglected in our model . from a different perspective",
    ", one may regard the first qubit as a part of the environment of the second qubit , and then the @xmath10 term models how the dynamics of one qubit might change the environment experienced by the other qubit . throughout",
    "we assume dimensionless units .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the eigenstates of @xmath14 , then a general two - qubit pure state at time zero can be written as @xmath15 where the upward or downward arrows in each of the four components represent the spin states of the two qubits .",

    "similar expressions can be obtained for all other density matrix elements . in our pure - dephasing model ,",

    "@xcite , a nested - udd scheme with two layers of @xmath27 and @xmath28 pulses can suppress the dephasing to the @xmath1th order , with about @xmath29 pulses in total . to examine",
    "if we can further improve the performance by optimizing the pulse locations , let us now consider the following scenario : @xmath30 pulses of @xmath0 rotation along axis-@xmath31 are applied to the first qubit , with the pulse locations given by @xmath32 , whereas @xmath33 analogous pulses are applied to the second qubit at times @xmath34 as a result , totally @xmath35 pulses are applied to the two - qubit system .",

    "@xmath42 $ ] these switch functions are defined to be zero .",

    "the decay factor in the exponential of eq .  ( [ decay ] ) then reduces to @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the noise spectrum ( or spectral density ) , namely , the fourier transform of the noise correlation function @xmath7 , with @xmath55 note that an equivalent expression may be derived using an exactly solvable spin - boson model with pure - dephasing .",
    "interestingly , the decay factor in eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) is seen to be the sum of two decoherence functions , each being analogous to that in the previous dd studies  @xcite . yet , the problem here is still rather complicated for two reasons .",
    "first , for the same control pulse , the coefficient @xmath56 can take different values in the three filter functions . indeed , its actual value depends on its relative pulse location in the time sequences of @xmath57 , of @xmath58 , or of @xmath59 .",
    "second , density matrix elements do not decay in the same fashion , and hence the decay of all off - diagonal density matrix elements needs to be accounted for .    repeating the above procedure for all other density matrix elements ,",
    "we finally obtain the averaged full density matrix @xmath60 as follows :    @xmath61    with the decay exponents for the off - diagonal elements given by @xmath62 for convenience , unimportant constants in eqs .",
    "( [ shortform1])-([shortform3 ] ) are either set to unity ( e.g. , @xmath63 ) or absorbed into the noise spectrum .    before ending this section , we stress that our straightforward calculations above are made possible by first assuming the statistical independence of @xmath8 and @xmath11 . if @xmath8 and @xmath11 has nonzero correlations ( noise under this correlated situation may be also called nonlocal noise , which is much different from our case here ) , then many of the density matrix elements can not be evaluated analytically .",
    "next we aim to optimize the pulse locations to keep @xmath60 as close as possible to the initial state . taking the trace fidelity",
    "@xmath64 $ ] as a measure of dd performance , it is straightforward to carry out the optimization if the initial state is known .",
    "however , in many cases a two - qubit state to be protected or stored is unknown , and as such the average fidelity for all possible initial states can be of more interest . averaging @xmath65 over all initially pure states and using the fact that @xmath66 , we arrive at @xmath67 the optimization then becomes the minimization of @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath69 , called the performance function below , is given by @xmath70 clearly @xmath71 , and a smaller value of @xmath69 indicates a higher degree of decoherence suppression .",
    "therefore @xmath69 can be also regarded an error function .    to minimize the value of the performance function , we first consider a total of @xmath35 pulses , among which @xmath33 pulses are applied to the second qubit .",
    "assuming that the @xmath35 pulses are applied at the timings @xmath72 one first needs to pick out @xmath33 pulse locations to apply the @xmath73 control operator .",
    "the number of such choices is given by the combination @xmath74 .",
    "then the analytic form of the three filter functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 can be fixed .",
    "we next minimize the performance function @xmath69 by optimizing the @xmath78 pulse locations using the line - search algorithm . in every iteration ,",
    "the algorithm searches for the minimum along the direction set by a gradient .",
    "we use @xmath35 equally spacing pulses and a two - layer nested - udd sequence as our initial guesses .",
    "once the result converges , we obtain the locally optimized locations for @xmath35 control pulses in a particular @xmath79 scheme . to find the optimal pulse locations , we test all @xmath80 possible choices of pulse allocations for the second qubit",
    ". furthermore , by scanning the value of @xmath33 from @xmath81 to the total number of pulses , we can find an optimal pulse - number partition for a fixed total number of pulses .",
    ".impact of nonlocal noise on the performance of optimized two - qubit dd sequences .",

    "effects of varying @xmath16 can be understood as the result of a rescaling of the strength and shape of the noise spectrum  @xcite . to appreciate that the issue of two - qubit decoherence suppression is significantly different from a one - qubit problem , let us first illustrate the influence of the nonlocal noise term @xmath88 on the performance of dd with @xmath84 .",
    "computational examples are shown in table  [ ta1 ] .",
    "it is seen that in the absence of nonlocal noise , the optimized performance ( error ) is of the order of @xmath89 , and the optimized dd pulses are applied at @xmath90,\\ ] ] which is simply two optimized 4-pulse sequences simultaneously applied to the two qubits .",
    "however , this dd sequence can not suppress any nonlocal noise because every pair of such simultaneous pulses will keep the sign of @xmath38 unchanged , and the associated decay exponent @xmath91 would be the same as that without dd , which is given by @xmath92 interestingly , as shown in table  [ ta1 ] , even with a very weak nonlocal noise added , e.g. , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the heaviside step function , the minimal error that can be achieved by an optimized dd sequence is already increased by five orders of magnitude ! this clearly addresses the importance of taking nonlocal noise into consideration for decoherence suppression .",

    "note that in the upper right panel , the two pulses applied to the second qubit coincide and hence cancel each other .",
    "[ fig2],title=\"fig : \" ]      as in single - qubit dd , we would naturally attempt to increase the total pulse number @xmath35 to achieve better and better dd performance",
    ". however , the optimization procedure faces much difficulty when @xmath35 increases considerably .",
    "first , the optimization algorithm becomes much slower in each run and may fail to give a converged result .",
    "for example , for @xmath182 , the converged pulse locations might be inappropriate , i.e. , violating the initial ordering of the pulse locations .",
    "worse still , for @xmath182 , we have to run the algorithm @xmath183 times for the single combination @xmath184 ( 12 pulses for the second qubit ) . hence computationally it is prohibitively expensive if hundreds of pulses need to be optimized .",
    "second , as the pulse number increases , the optimized result becomes more sensitive to the initial guess .",
    "mathematically it is also a challenging question to find the global minimum in a high - dimensional parameter space . for @xmath182 ,",
    "we have considered two initial guesses , namely , an equally spaced dd sequence and a nested - udd(4 ) sequence .",
    "the associated results are shown in table  [ ta6 ] .",
    "it is seen that for the same noise spectrum , the performance is only slightly better than that for @xmath111 .",
    "it is hence possible that our result as a locally optimized result is still far away from the globally optimized result .",
    "more effective optimization algorithms together with more initial guesses may be the ultimate solution .",
    "ccc + pulse combination & pulse location & performance + nested - udd(4 ) & 5,10 & @xmath185 + @xmath186 & 2,9 & @xmath187 + @xmath188 & 1,3,5,11 & @xmath189 + @xmath184 & 2,4,7,8,10,12 & @xmath190 +   + pulse combination & pulse location & performance + nested - udd(4 ) & 5,10 & @xmath191 + @xmath186 & 3,9 & @xmath192 + @xmath188 & 1,3,5,10 & @xmath193 + @xmath184 & 2,4,6,9,11,12 & @xmath194    it should be also noted that the total pulse number is physically limited .",
    "realistic pulses are imperfect and an ideal instantaneous @xmath0 rotation is never possible @xcite . as a result , the pulse - to - pulse errors may accumulate with increase of the pulse number  @xcite and hence more pulses do not necessarily lead to better performance .",
    "furthermore , constraint on the minimal pulse interval might place another intrinsic limit on the pulse number we could consider @xcite . for fixed total evolution time @xmath16 , such a constraint imposes an upper bound for the pulse number . for a varying @xmath16 , the optimized performance in practice will be connected with the available pulsing rate as well as the spectral bandwidth @xcite .",
    "using a pure dephasing model incorporating both local and nonlocal gaussian noise , we have studied how the dd protection of two - qubit states can be better achieved by optimizing the pulse locations as well as the partition of the pulse numbers allocated to each qubit .",
    "compared with nested - udd as a general - purpose dd scheme for two - qubit systems , our optimization procedure may improve the performance by many orders of magnitude , using only a few tens of instantaneous @xmath0 pulses .",
    "this makes it possible to use much less pulses to obtain a given fidelity of decoherence control in two - qubit systems .",
    "the price of this performance gain is the required knowledge of the noise spectrum .",
    "in addition , it is also seen that if the noise spectrum decays to zero slowly ( e.g. , a lorentzian shape ) , then even our optimized dd may not perform very well and it is only slightly better than nested - udd .",
    "the results here also help to gain more insights into the issue of dd protection in two - qubit or multi - qubit systems .",
    "the importance of fighting against the nonlocal noise in two - qubit decoherence control ( or more generally , the importance of taking into account the impact of the dynamics of one qubit on the environment of the other qubit ) becomes clearer . without the nonlocal noise ,",
    "our optimized dd sequence simply degenerates into two single - qubit optimized dd sequences . in the presence of nonlocal noise ,",
    "the optimized two - qubit dd sequence is quite different from two optimized single - qubit dd sequences , because the pulse numbers and pulse locations for each qubit should be adjusted ( in a somewhat subtle manner ) based on both nonlocal and local noise .",
    "if the local noise spectrum of the two qubits is highly unbalanced , then most pulses should be applied to one of the two qubits to defeat its rapid dephasing .",
    "it is these specific strategies , which are not exploited by the rather universal nested - udd scheme , that makes optimization possible .",
    "note also that in nested - udd schemes , the number of control pulses or the control order may be different for different control layers .",
    "but as seen from one optimization result in sec .",
    "iv - c , the performance of such type of asymmetric - nested - udd is still far from optimized .",
    "there have been wide experimental interests in both fundamental aspects of decoherence and the dd approach to decoherence suppression .",
    "two types of experiments may be motivated by this work .",
    "first , for two - qubit systems with known noise spectrum ( local and nonlocal ) , it is of immediate interest to apply optimized dd sequences to extend the lifetime of entangled states , hopefully with better efficiency .",
    "second , one may experimentally study the nonlocal noise of a two - qubit system by use of single - qubit dd .",
    "that is , if two single - qubit dd sequences are applied on top of each other , then ( assuming that the local noise of the two qubits are independent ) only the nonlocal noise is not suppressed and hence its impact on two - qubit dephasing may be directly observed .",
    "such type of experiments are of importance to the design of optimized two - qubit dd sequences and to the understanding of decoherence mechanism in two - qubit systems embedded in a solid - state environment .",
