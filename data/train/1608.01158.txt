    "previously we have stated that from computer search , the edge - reconstruction number of graph @xmath115 of figure 4 is 3 . but also",
    ", in this case , we can show directly that @xmath317 .",
    "barrus and west @xcite have shown that , except for the case of the 6-vertex caterpillar @xmath318 shown in figure 2 , @xmath55 of a caterpillar is 2 , or 1 , for stars .",
    "we shall now restrict our study in this section to the degree - associated edge - reconstruction number of caterpillars .",
    "but we first quote a very useful result by molina @xcite which allows us to identify a graph as a tree from two given edge - cards .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph with edges @xmath147 and @xmath151 .",
    "suppose that edge - card @xmath146 has two components which are trees of orders @xmath319 and @xmath320 while edge - card @xmath150 has another two components which are trees of orders @xmath321 and @xmath322 .",
    "if @xmath323 , then @xmath0 is a tree .",
    "moreover , we shall also make use of the next observation in order to identify when a tree is a caterpillar .",
    "let @xmath13 be a tree and let @xmath38 be an edge whose degree @xmath39 is greater than 1 and that @xmath96 is a caterpillar with an isolated vertex .",
    "then @xmath13 is a caterpillar .",
    "therefore the fact that @xmath13 is a caterpillar , is recognisable from any two da - ecards as long as at least one of them is not obtained by deleting an edge which changes the spine of the caterpillar .    from now on",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath13 is a caterpillar and since a caterpillar sequence @xmath324 denotes a path which has @xmath325 we shall henceforth assume that @xmath13 is not a path .",
    "we shall only consider da - ecards corresponding to @xmath96 and @xmath326 where @xmath327 and @xmath199 are end - edges which do not change the spine of @xmath13 .",
    "this is equivalent to reconstructing a caterpillar sequence @xmath328 from two sequences @xmath329 and @xmath330 and we shall consider the problem this way . note that the two sequences are given only up to left to right orientation ; we call two such orientations the reverse of each other",
    ". we shall also call @xmath329 a _ reduction _ of the sequence @xmath328 .",
    "a reduction is therefore a description of the corresponding da - ecard of @xmath13 without the isolated vertex .",
    "if a number of reductions of a sequence determines the sequence , we can say that the reductions reconstruct the sequence .",
    "we shall need the definition of conjugate entries in a caterpillar sequence . given the caterpillar sequence @xmath331 ,",
    "then the entries @xmath79 , @xmath332 are said to be _ conjugate_. + * notation .",
    "* the term @xmath333 will stand for @xmath334 and @xmath335 for @xmath336 .",
    "if the caterpillar sequence @xmath337 is not reconstructible from the reductions @xmath338 and @xmath339 then @xmath340 and all other conjugate entries are equal , except for a pair which differ exactly by one",
    ".    * proof . * for non - reconstructibility we must be able to get another sequence from the alignment    @xmath341 and @xmath342 suppose , for contradiction , that @xmath343 , therefore @xmath344 .",
    "therefore for the above alignment to lead to a reconstruction of @xmath278 , all other conjugate entries must be equal and @xmath345 must differ by exactly one , say , without loss of generality , @xmath346 .",
    "then the given alignment reconstructs as @xmath347 but , since all conjugate entries apart from @xmath348 are equal , this sequence is simply the reverse of the original sequence @xmath278 , therefore reconstruction is unique .",
    "( the above reasoning can be noted by following example @xmath349 ) .",
    "hence , for non - unique reconstruction , @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "therefore , for the above alignment to lead to a reconstruction of @xmath278 , we must have for some @xmath352 , that the conjugate pair @xmath353 differ by exactly one , say , @xmath354 , and all other conjugate entries are equal , as required .",
    "thus we get the following reconstruction @xmath355 ( example @xmath356 illustrates this situation ) .",
    "+    a caterpillar sequence can be reconstructed from two reductions .",
    "therefore , if @xmath13 is a caterpillar with at least two end - edges whose removal does not change its spine , then @xmath357 .",
    "* suppose the caterpillar sequence @xmath358 is not reconstructed from @xmath359 and @xmath360 .",
    "then by lemma 5.2 , @xmath361 and , for some @xmath352 , the conjugates @xmath362 differ by one . but then , since @xmath362 are not equal , the sequence is reconstructed from @xmath363 and @xmath364 .    if @xmath13 is a caterpillar which is not a path , then @xmath357 .    * proof .",
    "* the only remaining case to consider is when the caterpillar @xmath13 has only one end - edge whose removal does not change its spine .",
    "but it is easy to check that for such caterpillars @xmath357 .",
    "a caterpillar is expressed by the sequence @xmath365 and the following two reductions representing two edge - deleted caterpillars are @xmath366 @xmath367 where the second reduction is reversed with respect to the first one . comparing the two reductions will give the sequence @xmath368 , which is simply the reverse of the original sequence of the caterpillar .",
    "let a caterpillar be expressed by the sequence @xmath369 and the deletion of two of its end - edges gives the following reductions @xmath370 @xmath371 in which the second reduction is reversed . by comparing the two reductions ,",
    "the sequence @xmath372 is obtained , which is an alternative sequence to the original one .",
    "so the two sequences given by the two corresponding edge - cards do not reconstruct the given caterpillar .      in @xcite ,",
    "monikandan et al . defined a _",
    "star - like tree _ to be a tree obtained from @xmath373 by subdividing each edge at most once .",
    "they proved that any such tree has @xmath54 at most 2 .",
    "as already pointed out in section 4.1 , stars @xmath11 have degree - associated edge - reconstruction number of 1 .",
    "we shall show that if @xmath10 where @xmath374 is a tree obtained from the star @xmath11 by subdividing each edge @xmath12 times , as shown in figure 5 , then @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) @xmath375    let @xmath10 be a tree defined as above",
    ". then @xmath376 .",
    "by considering all possible da - ecards of @xmath10 , it is easy to show that it is not possible to reconstruct @xmath10 uniquely from only one da - ecard , therefore @xmath377 .",
    "let two da - ecards of the form @xmath378 each be obtained by deleting an end - edge from @xmath10 , so @xmath379 is made up of a unicentroidal tree in which all paths that emerge from the centroidal vertex are of the same order except one path whose order is one less than the others , and an isolated vertex .",
    "we claim that these two da - ecards reconstruct @xmath10 uniquely .",
    "since in both cases the degree of the deleted edge is 1 , the missing edge can only join the isolated vertex to any of the endvertices of @xmath379 .",
    "but if the isolated vertex is joined to any one of the equal paths that emerge from the centroidal vertex then the resultant tree can not have the two above mentioned da - ecards as part of its degree - associated edge - deck .",
    "hence the only possible alternative is to join the isolated vertex to the smallest path emerging from the centroidal vertex in @xmath379 . but",
    "this is isomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "hence @xmath376 .    based on these findings , the results in section 3 , and the fact that @xmath380",
