    "in recent years there has been an increasing wealth of interest in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , driven both by crucial breakthroughs in the qcd description of these processes@xcite and also by an incipient availability of data encompassing polarized , unpolarized , leading baryon , and diffractive deep inelastic phenomena@xcite .    from the perturbative qcd standpoint , semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) brings before theorists two novel and interesting features . on the one hand ,",
    "_ fracture functions _ which , in addition to structure and fragmentation functions , are required for the correct description of hadrons produced in the forward direction and for the factorization of collinear singularities . on the other , _ non - homogeneous _",
    "altarelli parisi evolution equations , which highlights the interplay of the three intervening parton densities in the scale dependence of these processes@xcite .",
    "although the main features related to sidis , and specifically to fracture functions , have been studied at the leading order ( lo ) in qcd ( order-@xmath1 in the cross - section)@xcite , up to now no computations had been done up to next to leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , as it is standard in the inclusive case .",
    "in particular , there were neither explicit checks of factorization at order-@xmath0 nor indications of how relevant the non homogeneous evolution might be at nlo .    in lo ,",
    "non standard evolution effects although non negligible , are restricted to a relatively small kinematic region , associated to the fragmentation configurations allowed at that order@xcite .",
    "this suggests to neglect these effects in many phenomenological analyses of polarized sidis@xcite , leading baryon production @xcite and diffractive dis@xcite , provided some cuts on data are introduced . in nlo",
    "the above mentioned kinematical restrictions are no longer present , which in principle may lead to important corrections . in any case , their phenomenological relevance needs to be assessed .    from a theoretical point of view , the computation of the sidis nlo corrections , and specifically the explicit check of factorization of collinear singularities involve also some subtleties which need close attention . at variance with the totally inclusive case@xcite , where after a convenient integration over final states the remaining singularities may be written as distributions in only one variable times a regular function , in the one particle inclusive case at order @xmath0 , it is necessary to keep additional variables unintegrated .",
    "consequently one , must deal with entangled singularities in more than one variable , corresponding for example to three particles becoming collinear simultaneously . as usual for semi - inclusive processes , in order to check factorization on has to keep track of the kinematical origin or configuration which gives rise to the singularity , which represents a non trivial additional complication and requires a detailed analysis of the singularity structure characteristic of the process .    in this paper",
    "we address the above mentioned issues restricting ourselves to processes where the initial state parton is a gluon .",
    "this allows to analyze and answer the main issues involved skipping for the moment , and for the sake of clarity , the formidable singularity structure associated with virtual corrections to quark initiated processes , which will be addressed in a forthcoming publication . in doing this",
    ", we develop suitable prescription rules for dealing with the sidis singularity structure .    as result of our approach",
    "we obtain the hitherto unknown nlo non homogeneous kernels for fracture functions and discuss their distinctive features such as their non - factorizable dependence upon two variables .",
    "we also verify explicitly the factorization of collinear singularities up to order @xmath0 , and give the expression for the renormalized fracture function in terms of the bare one . in order to asses the relevance of nlo corrections",
    "we compare the effects of the new evolution kernels with the already known lo corrections .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in the next section we introduce the relevant kinematics and conventions used and we extend the @xmath2 results for the sidis cross sections as required for the later factorization of collinear singularities at @xmath3 . in the second section",
    "we discuss the computation of amplitudes and phase space integration of the @xmath3 processes .",
    "there , we introduce a suitable parameterization for the phase space of the three final state particles , and extend some of the results given in refs .",

    "we analyze the sidis singularity structure at order @xmath0 and give details about the prescription recipes required for dealing with it . in the fourth we address the issue of factorization and technicalities associated with the convolution of distributions in many variables , present the novel nlo kernels and discuss the evolution of fracture functions . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "we begin considering the one - particle inclusive process in which a lepton of momentum @xmath4 scatters off a nucleon of momentum @xmath5 , @xmath6 and where in addition to the emerging lepton of momentum @xmath7 , a hadron @xmath8 of momentum @xmath9 is tagged in the final state .",

    "the integration leads to terms that can have none , one , or two poles along the thick curves in the figure , respectively .",
    "the case of a single pole can easily be handled with minor modifications to the prescription formula in eq.([eq : prescu1 ] ) . for terms with more than a single pole , the singular curves can either intersect themselves ( for example poles in @xmath54 and @xmath115 ) or not ( for instance @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .    terms with poles along two non - intersecting curves can be shown to be always transformed by partial fractioning into two terms with single poles , which reduce to the previous case . on the other hand ,",
    "the case of two intersecting singular curves can not be reduced to a simpler one and needs to be treated in a more subtle way .",

    "however , when @xmath24 diminishes the integration region expands and nlo contributions grow considerably faster than the lo ones which are kinematically restricted to the curve @xmath182 .",

    "in this paper we have computed the @xmath3 gluon initiated qcd corrections to one particle inclusive deep inelastic processes . at variance with the inclusive case , in one particle inclusive processes the kinematical characterization of the final state particle requires to preserve the full dependence of the amplitude in the relevant variables .",
    "this impedes the cancellation of some singularities to be later factorized into fracture functions and leads to a non trivial singularity structure . in order to deal with this",
    "we have highlighted the importance of collecting to all orders the potentially singular factors in the 3-particle final state angular integrals and implemented a general approach for the prescription of overlapping singularities .    by the explicit replacement of the bare parton densities ,",
    "fragmentation and fracture functions with the corresponding renormalized quantities in both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections , we have explicitly verified the factorization of collinear singularities obtaining for the first time the relevant kernels at this order . in doing so",
    ", we give a recipe for dealing with convolutions of distributions in more than one variable which occur in the computation of the @xmath0 contribution coming from the convolution of @xmath2 cross sections and renormalized functions .",
    "we also derived the evolution equations for fracture functions valid at nlo .    regarding the phenomenological consequences of these corrections",
