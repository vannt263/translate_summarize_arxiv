    "we examine three possibilities to reduce the @xmath54 background : a cut to restrict @xmath55 from above , rejection of events in which a top quark mass can be reconstructed , and a cut to restrict the transverse momentum of the leading jet . in the end ,",
    "an upper cut on @xmath55 in the event appears to offer the best advantage .",
    "indeed , one would expect that @xmath55 in @xmath24 events would be smaller than @xmath55 in @xmath54 events .",
    "top quark decays give rise to boosted @xmath31 s which , after decay , should result in larger values of missing @xmath56 compared to the @xmath24 process . the @xmath55 distribution is shown in fig .",

    "the plot on the right shows that the dps signal is produced in the region of relatively small @xmath55 and the @xmath54 background has a harder spectrum in @xmath55 .",
    "one way to suppress the @xmath54 background while leaving the dps signal unaffected is to impose a maximum @xmath55 cut in the 40 - 60 gev range . in the analysis that follows ,",
    "we include a maximum @xmath55 cut of 45 gev in addition to the acceptance cuts outlined above .",
    "the effects of the maximum @xmath55 cut are shown in the fourth column of table  [ tbl : cut - results ] .",
    "this cut eliminates about 80% of the @xmath54 background that remained after the initial acceptance cuts .",
    "backgrounds from events that contain a real top quark , such as the @xmath54 and single top events , might be reduced if one could reconstruct a top quark mass distribution @xmath57 from the final state objects ( bottom quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos ) , and then eliminate events in which the reconstructed mass falls in a narrow window centered on the known top quark mass .",
    "we attempted this by asserting the reconstruction of the @xmath22 mass to determine the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum , however the @xmath54 background was not sufficiently peaked due to several issues .",
    "these are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we also considered an upper cut on the @xmath58 of the leading object , since this would tend to be harder for jets coming from a top quark .",
    "while the backgrounds did in fact have a larger @xmath58 tail , they are also peaked on the low end where dps events are located , and so we abandoned this observable as a possible discriminator .",
    "we conclude this section with the statement that of the three possibilities to reduce the @xmath54 background we considered , a cut to restrict @xmath55 from above appears to offer the best advantage and is the only added cut we impose in addition to the acceptance cuts specified above .",
    "to separate the dps events from those of sps origin , we find it convenient to employ quantities which take into account information from the entire final state .",
    "one useful observable is @xmath59 , defined as @xcite : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the vector sum of the transverse momenta of the two @xmath42 jets , and @xmath62 is the vector sum of the transverse momentum of the lepton and missing energy in the final state .        in dps production , the bottom quarks are produced roughly back - to - back such that the vector sum of their transverse momenta tends to vanish .",
    "likewise , the vector sum of the lepton and neutrino momenta tends to be small ( with corrections from the boosted @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath59 distribution for the dps process exhibits an enhancement at low @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : sptprime - wbb - only ]",
    ". the peak does not occur at exactly @xmath63 owing to nlo real radiation that alters the back - to - back nature of the @xmath23 and @xmath64 systems . on the other hand",
    ", sps production of @xmath24 final states does not favor back - to - back configurations , and it exhibits a peak near @xmath59 = 1 .",
    "this feature is linked to the fact that many @xmath23 pairs are produced from gluon splitting @xcite .    the clean separation in @xmath65 between the dps and sps @xmath24 processes exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fg : sptprime - wbb - only ] is obscured once the @xmath54 background is included ( e.g. , see the left side of fig .",
    "[ fg : sptprime - w - and - wo - etcut ] ) .",

    "after the cut , a sharp peak is evident in the region of small @xmath65 where dps events are expected to reside .",
    "the plot on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fg : sptprime - w - and - wo - etcut ] , shows that extraction of a relatively clean dps sample can be accomplished by imposing a maximum @xmath65 cut .",
    "the last column of table  [ tbl : cut - results ] shows that a cut @xmath66 reduces the sps @xmath24 rate while leaving the dps signal relatively unaffected . in the end ,",
    "the major background arises from dps @xmath41 , as is expected since this process inhabits the same kinematic regions as the dps @xmath67 signal . despite this background , we find a statistical significance for the presence of dps @xmath4 of @xmath68 .",
    "observables which take into account the angular distribution of events are also useful in the search for dps . in the left plot of figure  [ fg : delta - phi ]",
    ", we show the event rates for dps @xmath24 and the backgrounds as a function of the angle between the normals to the two planes defined by the @xmath23 and @xmath64 systems .",
    "these planes are defined in the partonic center - of - mass frame and are specified by the three - momenta of the outgoing jets or leptons .",
    "the angle between the two planes defined by the @xmath23 and @xmath64 systems is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the unit three - vector normal to the plane defined by the @xmath71 system .",
    "we require full event reconstruction using the on - shell @xmath22-boson mass relations to determine @xmath72 , and use both solutions to the quadratic equation .",
    "we see that the distribution of the dps events is rather flat , aside from the cut - induced suppressions at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , whereas the sps events show a strong correlation , with a distribution that peaks near @xmath75 .    in the right plot",
    ", we show the event rates as a function of the azimuthal angle between the total momentum vectors of the @xmath23 and @xmath64 systems .",
    "since this azimuthal angle is defined in the transverse plane , it requires only @xmath55 , and no neutrino longitudinal momentum reconstruction .",
    "the shape of the dps distribution is flat while the sps distribution shows a strong correlation , with a preference for values toward @xmath76 .",
    "we also considered the azimuthal angle between the charged lepton and the total momentum vector of the @xmath23 system , since this was less sensitive to detector effects and higher - order corrections than using the neutrino - lepton system .",
    "however , this is far less efficient a discriminator , and for brevity , is omitted .    in both plots of fig .",
    "[ fg : delta - phi ] , it is clear that dps and sps exhibit different behaviors as a function of angular observables .",
    "however , the dominance of sps @xmath4 and backgrounds over dps @xmath4 for the full range of these observables makes it impossible to extract a dps @xmath4 signal from these distributions by themselves .       and @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath4 dps events lie in the lower half of the plane , while the @xmath78 sps and background events occupy the upper half .",

    "two - dimensional distributions of one variable against another show distinct regions of dps dominance ( or sps and background dominance ) . in fig .",
    "[ fg : scatter - plots ] , we construct one such scatter plot .",
    "we show @xmath65 versus the angle between the normals of the two planes defined by the @xmath23 and @xmath64 systems ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we see that the dps events reside predominantly in the lower half of the plane ( small @xmath65 ) and are distributed evenly in the angular variable .",
    "the separation between dps @xmath4 and the sps component is not as pronounced in the @xmath79 plane as we saw in our earlier study of @xmath80  @xcite . in the @xmath4 case ,",
    "the background events are more evenly distributed over the full plane , to some extent resulting from inclusion of both solutions for the neutrino s longitudinal momentum in the @xmath31 decay .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : scatter - contour - plots ] , the sps @xmath4 and background events in the @xmath81 plane show a strong preference for the upper right - hand corner of the plane .",
    "this two - dimensional distribution indicates that cuts on the @xmath65 and @xmath82 variables should permit extraction of an enriched sample of dps @xmath4 events .        to quantify the degree of separation ,",
