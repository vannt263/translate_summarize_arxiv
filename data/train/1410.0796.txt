    "has fractional calculus seen a broader application as a tool to describe a wide range of non - classical phenomena in the applied science and engineering , for example , the fractional fokker - planck equations for anomalous diffusion problems , continuous time random walk models with power law waiting time and/or jump length distribution ( @xcite ) , and the subdiffusion and superdiffusion process .    with the increasing utilization of fractional calculus",
    "it is necessary to develop appropriate and robust numerical methods to solve fpdes for practical application .",
    "a fundamental difference between problems in classic calculus and fractional calculus lies in the non - local nature of the factional operators and the dependance of history , causing the essential difficulties and challenges for numerical approximation .    in recent years",
    ", however , successful work has emerged to deal with discretizing fractional models by adapting traditional numerical schemes , including finite difference methods , finite element methods , and spectral methods .",

    "more recently , xu and hesthaven @xcite discussed stable multi - domain spectral penalty methods for fpdes and zayernouri and karniadakis @xcite analyzed fractional sturm - liouville eigen - problems .",
    "as an alternative , discontinuous galerkin methods have also emerged . in 2010 ,",
    "deng and hesthaven @xcite proposed a local discontinuous galerkin method for the fractional diffusion equation , and offered stability analysis and error estimates , confirming that the schemes should exhibit optional order of convergence for the superdiffusion case . almost in the same time ,",
    "ji and tang @xcite presented a purely qualitative study of the solution of spatial caputo fractional problems in one and two dimensions using a high - order runge - kutta discontinuous galerkin methods , but did not offer theoretical results .",
