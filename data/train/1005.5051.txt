    "they are completely regular and , since they are spacelike , they restrict a region in spacetime which is causally disconnected from the rest of spacetime . for that reason such topological structures are called ( spacetime ) bubbles .",
    "bubbles are spacetime structures with interesting properties . frequently discussed feature is that they can separate several black objects , thus allowing the construction of multi - black hole spacetimes without conical singularities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the rest of the paper we will construct a rotating generalization of the described solution , endowing the black ring with a single angular momentum along the spacelike killing field , which is associated with the non - compact dimension .",
    "although it was possible to obtain the static solution describing two kaluza - klein bubbles on a black ring in a relatively simple way , the construction of its rotating counterpart will require more advanced solution generation methods .",
    "fortunately , in 5-dimensional stationary axisymmetric spacetime all the solitonic techniques , developed for constructing solutions to the 4d stationary einstein equations can be applied with certain modification . in the current paper , we preferred to use the auto - bcklund transformation ( bt ) of the ernst equation in the form invented by neugebauer @xcite , @xcite as most suitable for our purposes .",

    "we will use weyl canonical coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the killing fields are represented in adapted coordinates in the following way : @xmath21 is the killing field associated with time translations , @xmath22 is the killing field corresponding to the compact dimension and @xmath23 is the remaining spacelike killing field .",

    "the 5d stationary axisymmetric gravitational field equations in vacuum can be presented in a convenient form using a complex potential @xmath25 .",

    "different independent solutions can be obtained .",
    "although these relations are much simpler than the original differential equation , they still involve integration . in some cases , however , there exist commutation theorems which can facilitate considerably the repetitive application of bcklund transformations .",
    "they state that for any bt applied to a given solution there are three other transformations leading back to the same solution , and specify the relations between the parameters of the four bt that ensure the commutation .",
    "once the commutation theorem has been proven , it allows the construction of solutions involving n subsequent applications of bt ( n - soliton solutions ) by purely algebraic transformations performed on a particular initial solution , called a seed .    as already mentioned neugebauer",

    "further , we have computed the area of the horizon @xmath154 it is directly connected with black ring s temperature as it can be observed by the relation derived in @xcite    @xmath155    here @xmath138 is the length of the kaluza - klein circle at infinity and @xmath156 is the length of the horizon rod .",
    "thus the temperature of the black ring is obtained @xmath157 where we have used the temperature of the static black ring on kaluza - klein bubbles @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "it is expressed in our notations as    @xmath159      near the horizon of the black ring , i.e. in the limit @xmath160 , @xmath161 , the solution simplifies considerably .",

    "we have introduced the expressions      where @xmath57 is a function of @xmath132 ,    @xmath171    note that the functions @xmath172 and @xmath173 fulfil the same relation @xmath174 , as the constants @xmath164 and @xmath163 .    in the limit @xmath175 , @xmath176 the function @xmath177 reduces to the constant @xmath62 , and consequently @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "it is easy to see that this limit procedure transforms the near - horizon metric into the rotating black string solution , as expected ( see section 5.2 . ) .",
    "the near horizon geometry can be interpreted as describing distorted rotating black string , which is deformed by the influence of the bubbles .",
    "the solution is characterized by three asymptotical charges - the adm mass @xmath181 , the tension @xmath182 and the angular momentum @xmath183 , which are defined in the komar integral formulation as    @xmath184,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath185,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath186    where @xmath187 is the hodge dual and @xmath188 is the interior product of the vector field @xmath189 with an arbitrary form .    calculating the integrals we get the expressions    @xmath190    in addition to the asymptotic charges we can define local quantities - the intrinsic masses of the black ring and the bubbles    @xmath191,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath192,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath193 is the 2-dimensional surface defined as the intersection of the horizon with a constant @xmath194 and @xmath20 hypersurface and @xmath195 @xmath196 are the bubble surfaces .",

    "the solution of elvang and horowitz is recovered in the particular case when the soliton transformation parameters @xmath88 and @xmath205 coincide with the horizon rod endpoints .",
    "this is realized at the special value of the parameter @xmath206 at which @xmath62 vanishes as well , according to ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "simple calculations show that in this limit the solution and its physical characteristics reduce to the static case @xcite .      in the limit",
    "when both kaluza - klein bubbles vanish the solution reduces to rotating black string . in order to take the limit in a proper way",
    ", we should shrink the bubbles to their inner points @xmath121 and @xmath207 , or , technically , let @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "thus we obtain a single finite rod located at @xmath210 , which is timelike and corresponds to a black string .",
    "there is one more special feature we should consider taking the limit - the regularity conditions ( [ beta ] ) should not be imposed on the parameters of the soliton transformation @xmath36 and @xmath62 . the metric function @xmath119 obtained after performing the described limit operation is not singular at @xmath121 and @xmath207 , but tends to zero instead .",
    "it corresponds exactly to the expected behavior since in this limit case the ergosphere intersects the @xmath4-axis at the horizon endpoints , so the metric function @xmath211 should vanish at @xmath121 and @xmath207 .",

    "on the other hand , the functions ( [ ab ] ) simplify to constants ( @xmath212 , @xmath213 ) . in this way the solution acquires the familiar form of rotating black string ( @xcite , @xcite )    @xmath214 + d\\phi^2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath27 are the following functions    @xmath217 , \\\\ \\nonumber \\lambda & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\ln \\left [ \\frac{(r_{\\sigma } + r_{-\\sigma})^2 - 4m^2 + \\hat{a}^2(r_{\\sigma}-r_{-\\sigma})^2/\\sigma^2}{4r_{\\sigma}r_{-\\sigma}}\\right ] , \\\\ \\nonumber \\omega & = & \\frac{\\hat{a } m}{\\sigma^2}\\frac{(r_{\\sigma } + r_{-\\sigma}+2m)\\left [ 4\\sigma^2-(r_{\\sigma}-r_{-\\sigma})^2\\right ] } { ( r_{\\sigma}+r_{-\\sigma})^2 - 4m^2+\\hat{a}^2(r_{\\sigma}-r_{-\\sigma})^2/\\sigma^2}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    actually ,",

    "it is obvious that it can be obtained as a limit of the rotating black ring on kaluza - klein bubbles by setting @xmath231 and @xmath232 in appropriate way .",
    "it means that we should ensure that both parameters tend to infinity in such a manner that their ratio remains finite , and further rescale the coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath233 such as    @xmath234    by introducing a constant @xmath235 , which tends to infinity at the same rate as @xmath236 and @xmath237 ( @xmath238 and @xmath239 are finite ) .",

    "in contrast to the static solution , which can be constructed in a relatively simple way @xcite , it is necessary to apply solitonic techniques to generate the rotating one . in the present article",
