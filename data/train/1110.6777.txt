    "optical nanoscopy is recognized as a powerful tool for investigating physico - chemical as well as biological processes in nanomaterials , whereby subwavelength spatial resolution is combined with a variety of spectroscopic techniques .",
    "the past decades have witnessed the development of several successful attempts in this regard , such as scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom )  @xcite , single - molecule spectroscopy  @xcite and the combination of the two  @xcite .",
    "these efforts have however suffered from the mismatch between light and nanoscale matter , which leads to a small throughput between the input and output signals .",
    "that is why coherent detection schemes , whereby input and output are in a well defined phase relationship , have found less application , although they may provide additional information  @xcite .",
    "recent developments in single - molecule spectroscopy have however been able to push the limits of coherent detection under various conditions  @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", it has been found that there is a profound relationship between the optimal concentration of electromagnetic energy and the strength of light - matter interaction  @xcite , pointing out how the possibility of focusing light below the diffraction limit may enhance the detected signal .",
    "the immediate question that arises is thus how to improve these schemes further and how to implement them for optical nanoscopies .    to address these questions",
    "we first note that the dramatic advances of nanotechnology experienced in recent years have enabled us to fabricate optical nanostructures that greatly improve the conversion of localized electromagnetic energy into radiation and vice versa  @xcite . in this context",
    ", single - molecule studies have shown how these so - called optical antennas may provide an unprecedented control over molecular - fluorescence  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found that a truncated metal nanocone may focus light into nanoscale dimensions with minimal suffering from absorption losses  @xcite and modify the radiation pattern of a light emitter placed near its tip  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such antenna architecture is fully compatible with scanning probe technology  @xcite .",
    "nanofocusing relies on the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) along a metal nanowire  @xcite .",
    "these modes do not have a cut - off and propagate optical energy in a tapered structure up to the very end  @xcite .",
    "note that this phenomenon applies to a variety of waveguide geometries  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to combine coherent spectroscopy with nanofocusing to explore how this approach may expand the detection limits of nanoscale objects , with particular attention on the competition between the enhancement of light - matter interaction , coherent detection as well as damping and dephasing processes .",
    "we furthermore highlight the unique features of scattering under nanofocusing and derive expressions for the visibility and the phase shift caused by a point - like polarizable object placed in the near - field of the nanocone sharp end .",
    "we verify our ideas by means of rigorous electrodynamic calculations , choosing very small metal particles to model nanoscale emitters affected by strong non - radiative damping .",
    "textbook treatments of coherent scattering consider a polarized plane wave incident on a material object . under these assumptions",
    "we may take advantage of the optical theorem to relate the signal collected by an infinitesimal detector placed in the forward direction to the total amount of power @xmath0 removed from the beam by the obstacle  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is the incident power , the normalized detected signal reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for visibility .",
    "an established approach to enhance @xmath3 relies on focusing light .",
    "however , because the optical theorem fails when the incident wave is not plane  @xcite , we need to depart from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ot ] ) and consider the scattering problem from first principles .    figure  [ fig : layout]a sketches the typical arrangement of an extinction experiment where the incident field @xmath4 is focused by a lens and the output field @xmath5 is collected by another lens placed in the forward direction . according to scattering theory , @xmath5 corresponds to the sum of the incident and scattered fields .",
    "moreover , since we are interested in nanoscale objects , we may say that the scattered field @xmath6 is proportional to the dipolar polarizability @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the incident field at the focal spot @xmath9 . for a classical oscillating dipole and a weakly excited quantum emitter",
    "we find  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wavevector , @xmath12 is the detuning from resonance and @xmath13 , @xmath14 respectively are the radiative and total damping rates .    in free space",
    "there is a fundamental limit to the optimal concentration of electromagnetic energy  @xcite . to understand how this gives rise to an upper bound for @xmath3 , we assume that @xmath4 is a focused plane wave of amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly consider the dependence on the focusing and collection semi - angles . in these circumstances eq .",
    "( [ eq : ot ] ) is replaced by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the infinitesimal collection solid - angle , whose maximum is @xmath18 , and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath20 is the scattering cross section  @xcite , the scattered power reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lens focal length and @xmath23 is the diffraction integral @xmath24 the third term at the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - int ] ) represents the power @xmath25 associated with the interference between @xmath4 and @xmath6 . for @xmath26",
    "we find @xmath27 note that @xmath25 is negative and contains the so - called extinction cross section @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath0 for plane - wave scattering .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 stems from two contributions .",
    "one comes from @xmath6 , since @xmath30 .",
    "the other one comes from the collection integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - int ] ) . that explains how the visibility @xmath31 builds up , showing that it depends twice on a diffraction integral : first in the focusing process , second in the collection process .",
    "equations ( [ eq : psca ] ) and ( [ eq : pint ] ) are valid for any type of focused beam if we replace @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the speed of light and @xmath35 is the electric energy density at the focal spot  @xcite .",
    "the maximum of @xmath3 is easily obtained starting from the bassett limit  @xcite @xmath36 and from the fact that an ideal oscillating dipole yields @xmath37 for @xmath38 . after replacing these quantities into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psca ] ) and ( [ eq : pint ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - int ] ) yields @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that we have chosen @xmath41 .",
    "we furthermore point out that @xmath3 is directly related to the phase shift @xmath42 that the scattering object induces in @xmath5  @xcite , namely @xmath43    we are interested in situations where the scatterer is far from being ideal , i.e. where @xmath44 . to gain insight we set @xmath38 and write @xmath45",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sigma - gamma ] ) readily shows that @xmath46 drops more rapidly than @xmath25 .",
    "that is why detection of weakly scattering objects is best achieved in extinction experiments  @xcite .    to analyze the visibility signal further",
    ", we choose a focused radially - polarized beam ( frb ) , because it allows a more direct comparison with nanofocusing .",
    "we remind that although @xmath3 is maximal at the bassett limit , it is only a few percents smaller for a frb  @xcite .",
    "the electric field of a radially - polarized beam on the gaussian reference sphere of an aplanatic system reads @xmath47 where @xmath15 is the field amplitude , @xmath48 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the optical axis and @xmath49 is the apodization function . @xmath50",
    "is the ratio between the lens focal length @xmath22 and the beam waist @xmath51 .",
    "we refer to eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - int ] ) and consider full focusing and collection in the forward direction , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "a few algebraic steps lead to  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the diffraction integral @xmath54    figure  [ fig : vis - quench]a plots @xmath3 as a function of @xmath55 for two values of the beam parameter @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "the curves exhibit a clear crossover between the region where radiative and non - radiative damping dominate . in the first case",
    "@xmath3 is weakly dependent on @xmath58 and it is only determined by the focusing strength . in the second case",
    "@xmath3 drops quite rapidly and even the strongest focused beam yields a tiny signal .    by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - frb ] ) we argue that @xmath3 may increase up to its maximum if the radiative rate @xmath13 be enhanced at will .",
    "figure  [ fig : vis - quench]b illustrates that a change in the local density of states ( ldos ) improves @xmath3 by a factor @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the ldos enhancement .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) is valid either for a classical oscillating dipole , where @xmath13 and @xmath58 refer to radiation and absorption , respectively , either for a quantum emitter , where @xmath13 and @xmath58 represent spontaneous emission and non - radiative decay  @xcite .",
    "we furthermore identify a crossover in @xmath61 when @xmath62 becomes equal to @xmath58 , whereby for larger @xmath60 the visibility approaches its maximum and @xmath61 saturates to @xmath63 .",
    "we are now ready to explore how nanofocusing may provide an effective way to achieve ultra - sensitive coherent detection at the nanoscale by combining large ldos enhancements , intense near fields and a nearly background - free illumination and collection scheme .",
    "we first recall how light propagates under nanofocusing  @xcite . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout]b , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 break the diffraction limit , because the nanocone funnels these fields to and from the probed object via the tip .",
    "a crucial feature of the configuration whereby a semi - infinite nanocone is replaced by a conical antenna is the efficient conversion between photons and spps .",
    "that is possible if we take a frb and tune @xmath56 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : frb ] ) ) such that the beam matches the nanocone radiation pattern . for the same purpose",
    ", the nanocone base diameter needs to be accordingly chosen  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 reaches the tip , the nanocone radius is so small that most of @xmath1 is reflected backwards  @xcite and it propagates towards the base , where it is radiated into the far field .",
    "moreover , if a scatterer is placed near the tip , @xmath6 couples to the nanocone and reaches the lens in the same spatial mode of the back - reflected @xmath4 .",
    "our goal is to find the detected signal @xmath64 , i.e. the visibility @xmath3 , and also the phase shift @xmath42 under nanofocusing . in this derivation",
    "we assume that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are perfectly converted into spps and vice versa , respectively .",
    "we first consider @xmath5 without scatterer near the tip , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout]b . in such case",
    "@xmath65 , where @xmath66 accounts for scattering and absorption losses that occur in the nanofocusing process  @xcite .",
    "we now add a polarizable nanoscale object near the tip .",
    "the calculation of @xmath6 requires some attention .",
    "first , in the nanofocusing process @xmath4 is enhanced by a factor @xmath67 with respect the value at @xmath9 in free space . here",
    "@xmath68 takes into account the effect of scattering and absorption losses in reducing the field enhancement .",
    "second , the fraction of @xmath46 that is coupled into the nanocone is proportional to the so - called @xmath69 factor  @xcite .",
    "third , the polarizability is modified by the presence of the tip , which enhances radiation damping and leads to @xmath70 here the primes indicate modified rates according to @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "fourth , due to absorption by real metals , the fraction of @xmath46 that reaches the lens depends on @xmath73 , the antenna efficiency  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath74 we may neglect the contribution of @xmath75 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - gamma ] ) ) .",
    "normalizing the signal by @xmath76 leads to @xmath77 where @xmath78 has been defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : focusing ] .",
    "a further simplification stems from the fact that @xmath79 .",
    "hence , @xmath3 reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 corresponds to @xmath3 under focused illumination . recalling that @xmath82 , the enhancement @xmath83 may be written as @xmath84 a similar expression is obtained when @xmath58 is due to elastic processes ( dephasing ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : k ] ) reveals that @xmath3 improves by two mechanisms .",
    "besides the one discussed in the previous section , which we named @xmath61 , we note an additional term @xmath85 that depends on @xmath86 and @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath87 , @xmath69 is close to one and @xmath85 reduces to @xmath88 . while for resonant dipole antennas it is common to find @xmath89 , for nanofocusing we may have the opposite result .",
    "that is possible because the incident beam is weakly focused ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vis - quench]a ) .    at last , we wish to examine the role of @xmath90 and @xmath73 .",
    "although they do not appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vis - nano ] ) , they are nevertheless important as the output signal is proportional to @xmath91 and @xmath92 . indeed , if @xmath90 tends to zero the amount of power that reaches the tip becomes negligible .",
    "likewise if @xmath73 is very small most of @xmath46 gets absorbed in the nanocone .",
    "thus the whole enhancement process is meaningless , because it is given by the division of two vanishing signals , namely @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to operate with antenna architectures that combine huge ldos enhancements with moderate absorption losses .",
    "we have modeled gold nanocones using a body - of - revolution ( bor ) finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) approach  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nanofocusing]a sketches a nanocone attached to an afm cantilever , treated as a semi - infinite quartz substrate .",
    "we have considered nanocone lengths between 1000 and 3000 nm , and base diameters optimized according to the wavelength range of interest  @xcite . without loss of generality",
    "we choose to work around 740 nm , which corresponds to an optimal base radius of 195 nm .",
    "the tip has a radius of curvature of 5 nm , which is a realistic value for state of the art nanofabrication  @xcite .",
    "if not otherwise stated , the fdtd mesh has a discretization of 1 nm .    we now move to the input and output fields .",
    "we illuminate the nanocone using a frb with @xmath95 to optimize the conversion of photons into spps .",
    "figure  [ fig : nanofocusing]b shows the magnetic field amplitude as the wave propagates towards the tip and comes back .",
    "a standing - wave pattern is indeed clearly visible .",
    "moreover , note that its structure changes as the field approaches the tip , because the effective wavelength becomes shorter in the nanofocusing process  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated how much power is absorbed by a 2000 nm long gold nanocone , finding that it amounts to nearly 50% of @xmath1 , hence @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nanofocusing]c plots the absorbed power @xmath97 and the output power @xmath98 as a function of wavelength .",
    "note that @xmath98 is in fact a little less than @xmath99 , because scattering losses occur during nanofocusing and conversion of spps .",
    "next we introduce @xmath6 by placing an oscillating dipole 10 nm from the tip , oriented along the optical axis . figure  [ fig : nanofocusing]d confirms that most of the power is radiated along the nanocone and exits the other end with an efficiency @xmath73 of about 70% , which is consistent with @xmath79 . to explore how @xmath6 behaves in the far field ,",
    "we have performed a near - to - far field transformation .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanofocusing]e for different nanocone lengths . as the nanocone gets longer the far field approaches that of a metal nanowire , indicated by a dotted curve .",
    "the dashed curve shows instead the profile of a frb for @xmath95 .",
    "we find that @xmath56 needs to be adjusted to optimize the coupling also in relation to the nanocone length . in practice",
    ", a shorter nanocone requires a frb with a slightly smaller @xmath56 .",
    "note that the length is an important parameter as it determines nanofocusing strength and propagation losses , which also depend on the nanocone composition and working wavelength  @xcite .",
    "having analyzed the behavior of the input and output fields , we move our attention to the enhancement factors .",
    "these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - nanofocusing]a , which shows @xmath86 and @xmath60 as a function of distance from the tip .",
    "both intensity and ldos enhancements are strongly distance dependent and grow very rapidly as we approach the tip .",
    "we are ready to quantify the visibility enhancements @xmath85 and @xmath61 , which are shown fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - nanofocusing]b for @xmath100 .",
    "we remark that @xmath85 is independent of @xmath55 as it contains only @xmath86 and @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , it weakly depends on the distance from the tip . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath61 changes by more than one order of magnitude as the distance is reduced by a few tens of nanometers .",
    "moreover , it approaches a plateau for distances less than 10 nm .",
    "there , @xmath60 becomes larger than @xmath55 and @xmath61 saturates to its maximum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vis - quench]b ) .",
    "the cooperation of @xmath85 and @xmath61 leads to an overall enhancement of more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "we verify our findings by performing coherent spectroscopy on very small metal particles . to gain insight",
    "we treat them as a point - like oscillating dipole with radiative corrections  @xcite , whose polarizability reads @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the nanoparticle radius .",
    "this expression is analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol - bare ] ) .",
    "we have used the drude model to describe the nanosphere dielectric function @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the so - called plasma and damping frequencies  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol - np ] ) @xmath106 stands for @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath58 represents material losses in the metal nanosphere and it corresponds to @xmath105 .",
    "radiation losses are instead parametrized by @xmath108 .",
    "a few algebraic steps lead to @xmath109 although @xmath110 is commonly much smaller than one , the possibility that @xmath111 may lead to substantial quenching of radiative damping and to a considerable increase of @xmath55 .",
    "the strength of light - matter interaction gets smaller due to a decrease in the polarizability ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol - np ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , the nanoparticle absorbs most of the light that is coupled to it . to study how these phenomena affect @xmath3",
    ", we respectively introduce the nanoparticle and the scattering efficiencies  @xcite , @xmath112 which turn out to be @xmath113 for our analysis we set @xmath114 and two different nanoparticle radii , namely 2.5 and 5 nm .",
    "moreover , we choose @xmath104 such that the resonance wavelength is 675 nm and 740 nm , respectively .",
    "these parameters lead to @xmath115 for @xmath116 nm and @xmath117 for @xmath118 nm .",
    "the corresponding @xmath3 under focusing is marked by vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis - quench]a . it amounts to 1 - 10% for the strongest focused beam and to 0.1 - 1% for the frb used for nanofocusing .      to facilitate the fdtd calculations we have reduced the nanocone length to 1000 nm and increased the mesh pitch to 2 nm .",
    "while the latter may reduce the accuracy of our results , it does not fake the main effect that we are interested in , namely the enhancement of @xmath3 . the layout of the problem is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - nanofocusing]a .    figures  [ fig : s - nanofocusing]b and [ fig : s - nanofocusing]c show that @xmath3 up to 83% may be achieved if the nanoparticle is probed by a nanofocused beam . in comparison to the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis - quench]a , it corresponds to enhancements of more than two orders of magnitude . as expected , to achieve the same signal with the smaller object we need to operate at shorter distances .",
    "as the nanocone approaches the nanosphere we recognize an increase in radiative damping by broadening of the dip in @xmath98 .",
    "note that @xmath98 without nanoparticle is about 44% , in agreement with the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : nanofocusing]d , which refers to a nanocone length of 2000 nm .",
    "the enhancement of light - matter interaction is noticeable in the phase shift too , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - nanofocusing]d .",
    "we finally remark that @xmath83 may be further improved by optimizing the nanocone parameters  @xcite , reducing the working distance and choosing systems with larger @xmath55 .",
    "we have proposed an implementation of coherent optical nanoscopy based on the nanofocusing concept and on scanning - probe technology .",
    "we have discussed the basic principles of this method and its potential in enhancing the detection of nanoscale objects .",
    "we have identified the two mechanisms that increase @xmath3 , namely the intensity enhancement and the modification of the ldos at the nanocone sharp end .",
    "while the second effect has been first investigated in single - molecule snom  @xcite and more recently in quantum - optics  @xcite , here we have shown how it may increase the visibility and the phase shift caused by an oscillating dipole .    in comparison with grating coupled nanofocusing  @xcite , which also provides a nanoscale source for scattering - type snom  @xcite , our approach exploits nanofocusing in both illumination and collection channels and realizes a kind of @xmath119 optical system .",
    "that is not easy to implement with grating couplers , because the throughput may not be high enough .    in comparison with resonant optical antennas ,",
    "whereby coherent coupling has been studied from a quantum - optical perspective  @xcite , our scheme does not suffer from resonance shifts that occur when a nano - emitter approaches the antenna  @xcite .",
    "we remark that these may completely detuned the antenna and compromise the enhancements .",
    "we wish to emphasize that these concepts are readily extendible to ultrafast and nonlinear techniques  @xcite , as well as coherent control  @xcite , whereby short laser pulses are efficiently converted into spps and nanofocused .",
    "multidimensional correlation spectroscopies  @xcite may also be implemented at the nanoscale in this way , without the need for hybrid approaches  @xcite .",
    "lastly , we wish to point out that these ideas may also be pursued in the infrared spectral range using surface phonon - polaritons  @xcite or at thz and lower frequencies using spoof spps  @xcite .",
