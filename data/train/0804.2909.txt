    "since the work of meiklejohn and bean,@xcite structures in which ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) materials are juxtaposed , have been known to exhibit additional unidirectional anisotropy .",
    "this anisotropy was attributed to the exchange interaction between the f and af spins at the interface between the materials and manifested itself in hysteresis loop measurements as a shift of the magnetization curve along the field axis .",
    "the shift is traditionally used to measure the size of the effect and is referred to as `` exchange bias . '' for the last 50 years , a vast amount of research , both experimental and theoretical , as well as ( more recently ) numerical calculations , has been undertaken to discern the nature of interfacial af / f exchange coupling.@xcite a complete theory , which would explain and correctly predict the various manifestations of exchange anisotropy , is still lacking .",
    "however , a number of models have been proposed and mechanisms have been identified , by which this anisotropy may occur .",
    "the models also predict values of the magnetization curve shift and enhanced coercivity , their relationship to material properties , as well as dependencies on the cooling field , temperature , strain , and thicknesses of af and f layers .",
    "experiments with af / f interfaces involving various measurement techniques have been carried out to quantify the exchange bias effect in many material systems and structures .",
    "for instance , the experimentally measured dependence of exchange bias on the af layer thickness allows one to test theoretical predictions and at the same time is important from the applications standpoint .    here , we report measurements of the dependence of the exchange bias effect in epitaxial la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2/la@xmath1ca@xmath0mno@xmath2  bilayers on the thickness of the af layer .",
