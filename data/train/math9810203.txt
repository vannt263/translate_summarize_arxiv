    "thus it does not make sense to speak of tangent spaces or riemannian metrics .",

    "a characterisation of quasi - isometric embeddings in terms of group theory is another topic of extrinsic geometry that has received some attention of late .",
    "this will be dealt with in section 3 .",
    "a different perspective of coarse extrinsic geometry comes from the asymptotic point of view .",
    "the issue here is behavior ` at infinity ' . from this perspective it seems possible to introduce and study finer invariants involving distortion along specified directions .",

    "this continues to be true if @xmath5 is replaced by any freely indecomposable group .",
    "in fact exponential distortion of a freely indecomposable group corresponds precisely ( up to passing to a finite cover of @xmath0 ) to the case of a hyperbolic @xmath32manifold fibering over the circle .",
    "the situation is considerably less clear when we come to freely decomposable subgroups of hyperbolic @xmath32manifolds .",
    "the tameness conjecture ( attributed to marden @xcite ) asserts that the covering of a closed hyperbolic @xmath32manifold corresponding to a finitely generated subgroup of its fundamental group is topologically tame , ie is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact @xmath32manifold with boundary .",
    "if this conjecture were true , it would follow ( using a theorem of canary @xcite ) that any finitely generated subgroup @xmath5 of the fundamental group @xmath36 is either quasiconvex in @xmath6 or is exponentially distorted",
    ". moreover , exponential distortion corresponds precisely ( up to passing to a finite cover of @xmath0 ) to the case of a fiber of a hyperbolic @xmath32manifold fibering over the circle .",
    "much of this theory can be extended to take parabolics into account .",
    "this class of examples can be generalized in two directions .",
    "one can ask for distorted discrete subgroups of @xmath37 or for distorted hyperbolic subgroups of hyperbolic groups ( in the sense of gromov ) . we look first at discrete subgroups of @xmath37 .",
    "a substantial class of examples comes from geometrically tame groups .",
    "in fact the simplest surface group , the fundamental group of a punctured torus ( the puncture corresponds to a parabolic element ) , displays much of the exotic extrinsic geometry that may occur .",
    "these examples were studied in great detail by minsky in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath57 s are given hyperbolic metrics such that their boundaries are uniformly quasi - isometric to @xmath70 .",

    "functions of arbitrarily fast growth may be realized .",
    "this answers a question posed by gromov in @xcite page 66 .",
    "a closely related class of examples ( the so called ` drill  holes ' examples of which the punctured torus examples above may be regarded as special cases ) appears in work of thurston @xcite and bonahon and otal @xcite .",

    "[ bf ]    based on bestvina and feighn s combination theorem and work of thurston s on stable and unstable foliations of surfaces @xcite , mosher @xcite constructed a class of examples of normal surface subgroups of hyperbolic groups where the quotient is free of rank strictly greater than one .",
    "this idea was used by bestvina , feighn and handel in @xcite to construct similar examples where the normal subgroup is free .",
    "thus one has examples of exact sequences    @xmath85    of hyperbolic groups where @xmath1 is a free group or a surface group .",
    "owing to a general theorem of mosher s regarding the existence of quasi - isometric sections of @xmath86 @xcite the distortion of any normal hyperbolic subgroup @xmath1 of infinite index in a hyperbolic group @xmath6 is exponential .",
    "further , it follows from work of rips and sela @xcite , @xcite that a torsion free normal hyperbolic subgroup of a hyperbolic group is a free product of free groups and surface groups . however , the only known restriction on @xmath86 is that it is hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "it seems natural to wonder if there exist examples where the exact sequence does not split or at least where @xmath86 is not virtually free .",
    "we now describe some examples exhibiting higher distortion @xcite .",

    "then @xmath6 is hyperbolic .",
    "let @xmath100 .",
    "then the distortion of @xmath5 is superexponential for @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , it can be checked inductively that the distortion function is an iterated exponential of height @xmath46 .",

    "see @xcite , page 151 for details on addition of ` random ' relations .",
    "it can be checked that these examples have distortion function greater than any iterated exponential .",
    "the above set of examples were motivated largely by examples of distorted cyclic subgroups in @xcite , page 67 and @xcite ( these examples will be discussed later in this paper ) .",
