    "at present , string theory and its extension , m - theory , provide the most promising schemes for the unification of the fundamental forces of nature .",
    "but before we can assign it the status of a theory of everything , we need to establish that the phenomenology of the standard model ( sm ) can be produced by some reasonable scenario .",
    "one of the outstanding problems is the origin of cp violation . in string",
    "theory cp is a gauge symmetry and can only be broken spontaneously @xcite by a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of some sm - singlet field .",
    "there is a variety of good candidates to do this job .",
    "these include the dilaton , @xmath2 , which is related to the gauge coupling via @xmath3and the moduli which parameterize the size and shape of the compact dimensions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( i=1,2,3 ) .",
    "all of these generically attain complex vevs and induce spontaneous breakdown of the cp symmetry @xcite .",
    "one must , however , make sure that this produces the right amount of cp violation .",
    "for instance , im@xmath2 of order one induces very large electric dipole moments ( edms ) through a contribution to the qcd @xmath6 parameter . on the other hand",
    ", it does not induce the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) phase .",
    "therefore the dilaton alone can hardly do a good job .",
    "the moduli fields can , at least in principle , induce the ckm phase without violating the edm bounds . in this paper",
    "we will consider the moduli fields @xmath4 as the source of observable cp violation and study to what extent such a scenario is phenomenologically viable have the same value , @xmath7 . ] .",
    "an important property of weakly coupled heterotic orbifold models is the existence of an @xmath8 symmetry : with integer @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the dilaton field is inert under this transformation at the tree level , but at the one loop level the cancellation of the modular anomaly requires it to transform as ( up to a t - independent imaginary shift ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the green - schwarz coefficient . in the weakly coupled heterotic string theory this symmetry",
    "is preserved to all orders in perturbation theory and provides important guidance for constructing low energy effective field theories .",
    "one however should keep in mind that this symmetry is broken spontaneously below the compactification scale and is realized nonlinearly at the electroweak scale .",
    "the modular symmetry has important implications for cp violation as it sometimes allows us to eliminate unphysical cp phases .",
    "complex vevs of the moduli fields as a source of cp violation have been considered before , see ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "these models however are not fully realistic as they do not address the issue of dilaton stabilization .",
    "the observed unification of the gauge coupling constants at @xmath13 implies that @xmath14 should take a value of around two .",
    "so , a consistent model must satisfy this requirement , which also has important implications for supersymmetry breaking . in this paper",
    "we shall examine scenarios which satisfy the following three requirements : +   + * 1 . * the dilaton field is stabilized at re@xmath15 .",
    "cp is violated .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking scale is phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "+   + we find that these requirements are quite stringent and leave very few viable possibilities .",
    "a somewhat similar question in the context of effective type i models was addressed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we note that one can also impose an additional phenomenological constraint that the flavor changing neutral currents are absent .",
    "however , as we will see , this constraint is often satisfied automatically in the class of models under consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensation and discuss properties of the scalar potential possessing a modular symmetry . in section 3 we present our analysis of dilaton stabilization via multiple gaugino condensates , non - perturbative khler potential , and s - duality .",
    "the ckm phase in heterotic models is discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the soft terms and modular properties of the cp phases . in section 6",
    "we analyze various types of edm contributions encountered in our models .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section 7 .",
    "all of the models we examine start with a single hidden sector gaugino condensate and then modify it to produce dilaton stabilization , so now we will take a short detour and give an introduction to this simple case .",
    "hidden sector gaugino condensation is one of the most popular schemes for the breaking of supersymmetry ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this is realized in @xmath16 heterotic string theory where the condensate lives in one @xmath17 , the other forming the observable sector .",
    "the veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential which describes the condensate is given by @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the one - loop coefficient of the beta function , @xmath20 is a chiral superfield whose lowest component corresponds to the gaugino condensate @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the gauge kinetic function .    in this paper we shall use a truncated superpotential , found by replacing @xmath23 by its value at @xmath24 .",
    "this approximates its value at the minimum of the scalar potential @xcite and gives : @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the ( standard ) khler potential is given by @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the scalar potential is expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the subscripts ( superscripts ) denote differentiation and the sum over repeated indices runs over the ( conjugate ) fields in the system .",
    "supersymmetry is broken by vevs of the auxiliary fields ( @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 string models typically contain hidden matter which can couple to the condensate .",
    "for scalar matter fields , @xmath33 , with a gauge group @xmath34 and  quarks \" with @xmath35 representations , the condensate superpotential is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a matrix containing the coefficients of the quarks in their trilinear terms in the superpotential , @xmath38 . we assume a generic singlet field @xmath39 ,",
    "so @xmath40 .",
    "since for a realistic case @xmath41 , the scalar potential is dominated by the term proportional to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "so , to a good approximation , the minimum occurs at @xmath43 , and we can neglect the terms containing @xmath33 in the khler potential . then we have : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the beta function and @xmath46",
    ".    this model does not lead to dilaton stabilization at a reasonable value @xcite , in fact at the minimum @xmath47 .",
    "so we must consider modifications .",
    "we shall study three models , one where corrections are made to the khler potential , one with an s - dual potential and another with two gaugino condensates .",
    "before we proceed , let us mention a few useful facts .",
    "first , if the scalar potential possesses an @xmath48 symmetry , the fixed points under the duality group are always stationary . in practice",
    ", these fixed points are often minima . as we will see ,",
    "if the modulus field is stabilized at a fixed point , the ckm phase vanishes and often there is no supersymmetry breaking .",
    "so our task will be to pull the minima away from the fixed points .",
    "second , for @xmath49 and the standard khler potential ( [ k ] ) , @xmath50 at the t - duality fixed points while @xmath51 at the s - duality fixed points .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath52 and @xmath53 keeping in mind that a derivative of a modular invariant function vanishes at the fixed points .",
    "this , of course , equally applies to the s - dual potentials .",
    "third , let us mention a useful property of models with factorizable effective superpotentials , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "in such models , for @xmath49 an extremum ( which is often a minimum ) of the scalar potential occurs at @xmath55 assuming the standard khler potential ( [ k ] ) . and @xmath56 . ] consequently , @xmath51 at this point since it is proportional to precisely this combination . in the general case of @xmath57",
    ", there can be departures from this result .    finally , in what follows we will consider generalized superpotentials consistent with the modular symmetry .",
    "that is , we will use the freedom to multiply the superpotential arising from gaugino condensation by a modular invariant function @xmath58@xcite :    @xmath59^{\\frac{m}{2}}j(t)^{\\frac{n}{3}}p\\left[j(t)\\right]\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the absolutely modular invariant function , @xmath61 $ ] is some polynomial of @xmath60 , and @xmath62 are integers .",
    "this is the most general modification consistent with t - duality and absence of singularities inside the fundamental domain .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that explicit examples where @xmath58 appears are lacking , so it is possible that we allow ourselves more freedom than there is in practise .",
    "we will typically set @xmath61 $ ] to one , noting that increasing the amount of @xmath60 in the potential typically forces the minima of @xmath7 to the fixed points . in practice ,",
    "the modulus field often gets stabilized at @xmath63 .",
    "then , for @xmath64 , there is no supersymmetry breaking because @xmath65 , and such models must be discarded .",
    "the same applies to the other fixed points for @xmath66 since @xmath67 .",
    "as we have seen above , the simplest model of gaugino condensation does not lead to a finite value of the dilaton field . since the vev of the dilaton describes the gauge coupling constants , such a model is phenomenologically unacceptable .",
    "the simple model above might well be oversimplified and in more involved models dilaton stabilization can be achieved while retaining the main features of the single gaugino condensate model .",
    "c    c      generally , the hidden sector may contain non - semi - simple gauge groups . given the right matter content , it is plausible that gauginos condense in each of the simple group factors . with a nonzero im@xmath2",
    ", these condensates may enter the superpotential with opposite signs thereby leading to dilaton stabilization .",
    "let us consider a model with two gaugino condensates .",
    "suppose we have a gauge group @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70  quark \" representations .",
    "the superpotential is simply the sum of that , ( [ wsimp ] ) , for each of the individual condensates @xcite",
    ": @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 we have dilaton stabilization at @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite . in this case",
    "the ckm phase is zero and we should consider modifications . keeping the same condensing gauge groups and the matter content , we can multiply the superpotential by @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting minima are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the table shows @xmath2 and @xmath7 at the minima along with their auxiliary fields for various powers @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "susy breaking is given in planck units and @xmath78 indicates susy breaking much below the phenomenologically allowed range .",
    "for @xmath49 , we see that @xmath2 is always stabilized at a reasonable value and @xmath7 is complex for @xmath79 .",
    "this is illustrated in figs.[cpfig1 ] and [ cpfig2 ] .",
    "we can see that for @xmath80,@xmath81 the fixed point @xmath82 is a local maximum .    in all cases @xmath51 due to eq.[fs ] , whereas @xmath83 may be nonzero . in most cases the modulus is stabilized on the unit circle and susy remains unbroken .",
    "the presence of extrema on the unit circle can be seen from the fact that that there is always a stationary point at @xmath84 and there is a point on the unit circle where @xmath85 vanishes ( since it is a derivative of a modular invariant function ) , whereas @xmath86 is always zero .",
    "the minima on the unit circle ( if they exist ) away from the fixed points are typically lower then those at the fixed points because in the former case susy breaking is zero and the potential is negative while in the latter case the entire potential vanishes .    for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath81 we have viable",
    "supersymmetry breaking ( @xmath89 ) , but only in the latter case is there cp violation .",
    "however , even in this case @xmath7 is close to the fixed point @xmath82 which results in a suppressed ( @xmath90 ) ckm phase if @xmath91 is the only source of cp violation .",
    "we note that the dilaton also has a complex vev in order to produce a relative sign between the condensates and im@xmath2 is fixed up to a discrete shift @xcite .    in all interesting cases , @xmath83 receives a complex phase of order one .",
    "this occurs due to a rapid variation of @xmath85 ( eq.[g ] ) around the fixed points .",
    "however , @xmath83 is not modular invariant by itself so this does not necessarily mean that the physical susy cp phases are also @xmath92 . we will discuss this subject separately in one of the subsequent sections .",
    "introduction of the green - schwarz term does not significantly change the situation , as should probably be expected .",
    "the only relevant change is that now @xmath93 differs from zero due to the dilaton - modulus mixing ( table [ table2 ] ) . in all cases",
    "@xmath94 is of order @xmath83 and also has an order one complex phase .",
    "one generally expects the khler potential to receive corrections from non - perturbative effects .",
    "such effects may be responsible for dilaton stabilization .",
    "for instance , in ref.@xcite the following khler potential was suggested : @xmath95 where @xmath96 are certain constants ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "c    c    the superpotential remains given by eq.[trunw ] .",
    "the second term under the log in eq.[nonperk ] represents non - perturbative corrections .",
    "its form based on the natural assumptions that non - perturbative effects vanish in the limit of vanishing coupling constant ( @xmath98 ) and are zero at all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "note that the scalar potential is a function of re@xmath2 only , so im@xmath2 remains undetermined .    in table",
    "[ table3 ] we present the results of the potential minimization for @xmath76 and @xmath77 between 0 and 5 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the presence of @xmath58 does not visibly affect the value of @xmath2 at the minimum , but typically forces @xmath101 into the fixed points . at these points",
    "no cp violation is produced and susy remains unbroken unless @xmath87 ( recall that @xmath102 ) .",
    "clearly , these minima are phenomenologically unacceptable . having varied @xmath103",
    ", we were unable to find viable cp - violating minima with a reasonable susy breaking scale .",
    "the same remains true for a nonzero @xmath12 ( table [ table4 ] ) .",
    "this however does not mean that this stabilization mechanism is altogether unattractive .",
    "it has a nice feature that dilaton - dominated susy breaking can be obtained and most of the soft cp phases can be eliminated .",
    "cp violation in this case may originate from fields other than the dilaton and moduli , for instance , froggatt - nielsen type fields . to avoid the susy cp problem",
    ", one needs to ensure that such fields do not break supersymmetry .",
    "c    c    it is feasible that the underlying theory can possess @xmath104 s - invariance in addition to the well known t  modular invariance .",
    "s - self - dual models naturally exhibit dilaton stabilization as large and small values of s are related by s - duality @xcite . in general , the gauge coupling is given by the gauge kinetic function @xmath105 : @xmath106",
    "so one can have @xmath107 under @xmath108 if @xmath109 , as opposed to the standard strong  weak duality .",
    "since in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath47 ) @xmath110 , the simplest s - invariant kinetic function is @xcite @xmath111 note that this duality relates theories with the same coupling , but differing values of @xmath2 .",
    "the standard khler potential @xmath112 , where @xmath113 , then implies that the superpotential must have weight -1 with respect to the s - duality transformation : @xmath114\\;,\\]]where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are constants . integrating out the condensate using the truncated approximation",
    ", we get , after absorbing the constant @xmath117 into @xmath118 , @xmath119    in our numerical analysis , we consider a model with a @xmath120 gauge group .",
    "the corresponding minima for the case without matter are shown in table [ table5 ] .",
    "the situation is very similar to the case of the racetrack models apart from the value of @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath93 always vanishes since @xmath2 is stabilized at the fixed point . for @xmath79 , @xmath66 , the minima in @xmath7",
    "are located on the unit circle where @xmath83 vanishes .",
    "the only reasonable minimum appears for @xmath122 , but again it is close to the fixed point where the ckm phase vanishes .",
    "figs.[cpfig3 ] and [ cpfig4 ] illustrate the behaviour of the potential , which is very similar to what we have seen in the racetrack models .",
    "we do not consider @xmath123 case since it is not clear whether one can maintain both t- and s- modular invariance at the one loop level .",
    "in this section we will briefly discuss how the ckm phase can be produced in heterotic orbifold models .",
    "one of the crucial requirements any model should satisfy is that it reproduces the standard ckm picture of cp violation and the consequent ckm phase is of order one .",
    "complex yukawa couplings in heterotic string models can be generated if the matter multiplets belong to the twisted sectors and the moduli fields attain complex vevs . in general , this does not necessarily mean that a nonzero ckm phase is produced .",
    "the complex phases in the yukawa matrices can often be removed by a basis transformation consistent with the @xmath124 symmetry .",
    "the proper measure of cp violation in the standard model is given by the jarlskog invariant @xcite : @xmath125~ \\biggr)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 are the yukawa matrices .",
    "a non - zero @xmath127 indicates the presence of the ckm phase .",
    "the ( renormalizable ) yukawa couplings can be calculated exactly in a given heterotic orbifold model .",
    "often the yukawa couplings have a very restricted flavour structure such that the complex phases are spurious and the jarlskog invariant vanishes .",
    "that is the case for the prime order orbifolds , whereas for the non - prime orbifolds the ckm phase can be non - trivial @xcite . here",
    "we will give an example of the @xmath128-i orbifold assuming that we have the freedom to assign a field to a fixed point of our choice @xcite .",
    "note however that we do not attempt to reproduce the observed fermion masses and mixings , so this picture is not fully realistic .",
    "nevertheless , it gives a fair idea of cp violation in the system .",
    "due to string selection rules , only fields belonging to particular fixed points can couple via the yukawa interaction .",
    "this restricts the flavour structure of the yukawa matrices . in the @xmath128-i case ,",
    "one of the allowed couplings is @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denote the twisted sectors .",
    "the corresponding @xmath131 yukawa couplings are expressed as @xcite @xmath132\\ ; , \\label{yukawa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 are the fixed points , @xmath134 represents a projection of @xmath135 onto the first two complex planes ( corresponding to @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) , @xmath138 is a four - dimensional vector with integer components , @xmath139 is a normalization factor , @xmath140 are the `` multiplicity '' constants associated with the fixed points , and the matrix @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 clearly , this yukawa coupling is complex for complex @xmath7 .",
    "next , we need to assign the observable fields to the fixed points . one possible assignment producing a nonzero jarlskog invariant is given in table [ z6 ] ."
