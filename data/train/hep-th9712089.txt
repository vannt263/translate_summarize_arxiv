    "the @xmath0 model in flat space is a scalar field theory whose configuration space @xmath2 consists of finite energy maps from euclidean @xmath3to the complex projective space @xmath0 , the energy functional being constructed naturally from the riemannian structures of the base and target spaces ( that is , the model is a pure sigma model in the broad sense ) .",
    "the requirement of finite energy imposes a boundary condition at spatial infinity , that the field approaches the same constant value , independent of direction in @xmath3 , so that the field may be regarded as a map from the one point compactification @xmath4 to @xmath0  .",
    "since @xmath5 also , finite energy configurations are effectively maps @xmath6 , the homotopy theory of which is well understood , and the configuration space is seen to consist of disconnnected sectors @xmath7 labelled by an integer @xmath8 , the `` topological charge '' ( degree ) , @xmath9 each configuration is trapped within its own sector because time evolution is continuous .",
    "the lorentz invariant , time - dependent model is not integrable but complete solution of the static problem has been achieved by means of a bogomolnyi argument and the general charge @xmath8 moduli space , the space of charge-@xmath8 static solutions @xmath10 , is known ( that _ all _ static , finite energy solutions of the @xmath0  model saturate the bogomolnyi bound is a non - trivial result @xcite ) .",
    "each static solution within the charge-@xmath8 sector has the same energy ( minimum within that sector and proportional to @xmath8 ) , and @xmath11 is parametrized by @xmath12 parameters ( the moduli ) , so such a moduli space may be thought of as the @xmath13-dimensional level bottom of a potential valley defined on the infinite dimensional charge-@xmath8 sector , @xmath7 . low energy _",
    "dynamics _ may be approximated by motion restricted to this valley bottom , a manifold embedded in the full configuration space , and thus inheriting from it a non - trivial metric induced by the kinetic energy functional .",
    "the approximate dynamic problem is reduced to the geodesic problem with this metric , and has been investigated by several authors @xcite . in the unit - charge sector",
    "one here encounters a difficulty : certain components of the metric are singular and the approximation is ill defined . for example ,",
    "unit - charge static solutions are localized lumps of energy with arbitrary spatial scale , so one of the six moduli of @xmath14 is a scale parameter .",
    "motion which changes this parameter is impeded by infinite inertia in the geodesic approximation , a result in conflict with numerical evidence which suggests that lumps collapse under scaling perturbation @xcite .",
    "this problem should not be present in the model defined on a compact two dimensional physical space .",
    "the obvious choice is the @xmath15-sphere because the homotopic partition of the configuration space carries through unchanged .",
    "also , @xmath16 with the standard metric is conformally equivalent to euclidean @xmath17 , and the static @xmath0 model energy functional is conformally invariant , so the whole flat space static analysis is still valid and all the moduli spaces are known .",
    "however , the kinetic energy functional _ does _ change and induces a new , well defined metric on the unit - charge moduli space . by means of the isometry group derived from the spatial and internal symmetries of the full field theory we can place restrictions on the possible structure of this metric , greatly simplifying its evaluation .",
    "the geodesic problem is still too complicated to be solved analytically in general , but by identifying totally geodesic submanifolds , it is possible to obtain the qualitative features of a number of interesting solutions . in particular ,",
    "the possibilities for lumps travelling around the sphere are found to be unexpectedly varied .",
    "the @xmath0 model on the @xmath15-sphere is defined by the lagrangian @xmath19=\\int_{s^{2}}\\ , ds\\ , \\frac{\\partial_{\\mu}w\\partial_{\\nu}\\bar{w}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{2}}\\ ,        \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a complex valued field , @xmath21 is the invariant @xmath16 measure and @xmath22 are the components of the inverse of the lorentzian metric @xmath23 on r(time)@xmath24(space ) , @xmath25 being the natural metric on @xmath16 .",
    "although the language of the @xmath0 model is analytically convenient , the homotopic classification and physical meaning of the field configurations are more easily visualized if we exploit the well known equivalence to the @xmath26 sigma model @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the scalar field is a three dimensional isovector   constrained to have unit length with respect to the euclidean @xmath27 norm ( @xmath28 ) , that is , the target space is the 2-sphere of unit radius with its natural metric , which we will denote @xmath29   for clarity .",
    "( the suffix refers to `` isospace '' in analogy with the internal space of nuclear physics models . )",
    "the @xmath0  field @xmath20 is then thought of as the stereographic image of   in the equatorial plane , projected from the north pole , @xmath30 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath31 and @xmath32 then @xmath19\\equiv l_{\\sigma}[{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}}]=\\frac{1}{4}\\int_{s^{2}}\\ , ds\\ ,           \\partial_{\\mu}{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}}\\cdot\\partial_{\\nu}{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}}\\ , \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] the familiar @xmath26 sigma model lagrangian . a @xmath20 configuration , then , may be visualized as a distribution of unit length arrows over the surface of the physical 2-sphere @xmath33 .",
    "each smooth map @xmath33@xmath34@xmath29  falls into one of a discrete infinity of disjoint homotopy classes , each class associated with a unique integer which may be thought of as the topological degree of the map ( see , for example @xcite ) , so homotopic partition of the configuration space is built in to the model from the start .",
    "we also choose stereographic coordinates @xmath35 on @xmath33 , in terms of which , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath35 takes all values in @xmath3 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the radius of @xmath33  has been normalized to unity .",
    "the invariant measure is , @xmath41 and so , @xmath19 = \\int\\ , dx\\ , dy\\ , \\frac{1}{(1+|w|^{2})^{2}}\\left ( \\frac{|\\dot{w}|^{2}}{(1+r^{2})^{2}}-\\left|\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right|^{2 }                                     -\\left|\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\\right|^{2 }                                     \\right).\\ ] ] we identify kinetic energy , @xmath42 = \\int\\ , \\frac{dx\\ , dy}{(1+r^{2})^{2}}\\frac{|\\dot{w}|^{2}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{2}}\\ ] ] and potential energy @xmath43 = \\int\\ , dx\\ , dy\\ , \\frac{1}{(1+|w|^{2})^{2}}\\left (                            \\left|\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right|^{2}+                             \\left|\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\\right|^{2 }                                     \\right).\\ ] ] note that the potential energy is identical to that for flat space by virtue of the conformal invariance of the static model ( stereographic projection is a conformal transformation ) .",
    "thus the familiar bogomolnyi argument @xcite follows immediately and ( @xmath44 run over @xmath45 and @xmath46 represents the @xmath27 vector product in  space ) : @xmath47 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "case corresponds to static solutions of positive ( negative ) degree , and if @xmath20 is single valued with finite degree @xmath8 , then it must be a rational map of degree @xmath8 in @xmath51 if @xmath52 or in @xmath53 if @xmath54 .",
    "we shall deal with the unit charge moduli space , consisting of all rational maps of degree 1 in @xmath51 .",
    "since the configuration space and moduli spaces of the flat space and spherical space models are diffeomorphic , we shall use the same notation ( @xmath55 etc . ) in both cases .",
    "the simplest static unit - charge solution is @xmath56 which we shall call the symmetric hedgehog because its   field points radially outwards at all points on @xmath33 .",
    "its energy density is uniformly distributed , so it is not really a lump .",
    "since the static model is conformally invariant , any configuration obtained from this by a mbius transformation must be another point on the moduli space .",
    "in fact the orbit of @xmath57 under the mbius group _ is _ the space of degree 1 rational maps , each map being generated by one and only one group element .",
    "thus we may identify the moduli space with the parameter space of the mbius group .",
    "there is a well known matrix representation of mbius transformations @xcite which we denote thus : @xmath58 where @xmath59 so that @xmath60 . the last condition ensures the invertibilty of the transformation and fixes the degree of @xmath20 at 1 .",
    "the mbius group product becomes matrix multiplication , @xmath61 where the left hand side means @xmath62 in obvious notation .",
    "all matrices differing by a constant factor yield the same configuration , and @xmath60 so when we divide by this scaling equivalence we can choose a unimodular matrix as the representative for each equivalence class .",
    "there are two such matrices possible for each distinct configuration because if @xmath63 is unimodular , so is @xmath64 .",
    "thus @xmath65 is a double cover of the moduli space , which we recover by dividing out the equivalence @xmath66 : the moduli space is @xmath67 .",
    "coincidentally , @xmath65 is also a double cover of the proper orthochronous lorentz group .",
    "the statement that any lorentz transformation may be formed by a unique composition of a boost then a rotation ( or _ vice versa _ ) translates to the existence , for all @xmath68 , of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , a positive definite , unimodular , hermitian @xmath71 matrix ( call this set @xmath72 ) , satisfying @xmath73 both @xmath74 and @xmath70 being unique @xcite .",
    "it follows that the space @xmath65 is locally a product of @xmath75 ( the group manifold of @xmath76 ) and @xmath27 ( the parameter space of @xmath72 ) , a result which generalizes globally , @xmath77 .",
    "we may choose local coordinates on @xmath65 by defining the standard euler angles @xmath78 on @xmath75 , @xmath79 and expanding @xmath70 in terms of pauli matrices , @xmath80 @xmath81 being chosen to ensure the unimodular and postive definite properties : @xmath82 the 3-vector  ( modulus @xmath83 ) takes all values in @xmath27 , while @xmath84 $ ] , @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "these ranges allow @xmath63 to take all values in the double cover @xmath65 . in analyzing the structure of the metric",
    ", it is convenient to work with @xmath65 , checking that the metric is single valued under the identification of @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the true moduli space @xmath67 is charted by the same coordinates but with @xmath87 lying in the reduced range @xmath88 $ ] , for @xmath74 is then restricted to the `` upper half '' of @xmath75 .",
    "the chart has a coordinate singularity at @xmath89 and at @xmath90 .",
    "the explicit connexion between a point in @xmath14 and the corresponding static solution will be made in section 5 , below .",
    "field dynamics of the @xmath0  model may be visualized as the dynamics of a point particle with `` position '' @xmath91 moving in an infinite - dimensional configuration space .",
    "a solution @xmath92 of the field equations is thought of as a trajectory in this space , motion on which is determined by metric @xmath93 $ ] and potential @xmath94 $ ] . in the unit - charge sector",
    ", the bogomolnyi argument shows that there is a six - dimensional subspace on which the potential achieves its topological minimum value of @xmath95 , and that any perturbation departing from this subspace must involve increasing @xmath96 .",
    "if a configuration sitting at the bottom of this potential valley is given a small velocity tangential to it then we expect the ensuing time - evolved field to stay close to the valley bottom , for departure from it entails climbing up the valley walls . in the geodesic approximation",
    "@xcite we restrict motion to the valley bottom , assuming that orthogonal modes are insignificant .",
    "thus , at all times @xmath92 is a solution of the _ static model _ , but we allow the moduli @xmath97 , denoted collectively by @xmath98 , to vary with time in accordance with the inherited action principle .",
    "so , @xmath99 and the lagrangian is @xmath100 defining the induced metric , @xmath101 and ignoring the irrelevant constant , the lagrangian is recast as that of a free particle moving on a riemannian manifold with metric @xmath102 : @xmath103 the equations of motion are the geodesic equations . in principle",
    "all we need do is evaluate the integrals of ( [ eq : metricdef ] ) , but these are 21 functions of 6 variables so as it stands this is intractable in practice .",
    "it is profitable to take a more circumspect approach , using symmetries of the model to place restrictions on the structure of @xmath102 .",
    "consider the rotation group @xmath104 acting on @xmath33  and @xmath29 .",
    "the former is the group of spatial rotations ( under which @xmath20 , or equivalently , transforms as a scalar ) while the latter is the group of global internal rotations ( henceforth called `` isorotations '' ) of the  field of which @xmath20 is the stereographic image .",
    "any such transformation @xmath105 leaves invariant ( a ) the topological charge , so @xmath105 is a bijection @xmath106 , ( b ) the potential energy , so within @xmath7 static solutions are mapped to other static solutions , @xmath107 , and ( c ) the kinetic energy , which induces the metric on @xmath11 . hence @xmath105 is an isometry of @xmath108 . the @xmath76 subgroup of the mbius group s double cover , @xmath65 , acting via the operation @xmath109 defined by equation ( [ eq : dotdef ] ) is the double cover of the group of rotations of the 2-sphere @xcite considered as operations on the projective plane ( spatial or internal , ie acting on @xmath49 or @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus we find that ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 produces an isorotation of the configuration @xmath112 , while @xmath113 produces a spatial rotation , both isometries of the induced metric .",
    "the action of the isorotation on the moduli space is simple : @xmath114 the isometry takes the @xmath76 left multiplication action on @xmath115 while leaving the @xmath27 moduli  unchanged . using a technique standard in the analysis of isometries in general relativity @xcite , we change from the",
    "coordinate basis on @xmath116 , to a non - coordinate basis , in this case the left - invariant 1-forms of the lie group @xmath76 .",
    "these may be found by expanding the left - invariant 1-form @xmath117 in terms of a convenient basis of the lie algebra @xmath118 , for example @xmath119 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath120 where @xmath121 if we evaluate the metric at one particular point on @xmath115 , for all possible @xmath122 , we can obtain the metric at all other points on @xmath115 because @xmath115 is the isorotation orbit of our base point , and isorotation is an isometry , so the metric must remain constant ( for each ) over the entire orbit .",
    "`` constant '' means unchanging when considered as a geometric object , not that the components with respect to the original coordinate basis are constant , because the basis vectors themselves transform non - trivially .",
    "the basis of ( [ eq : sigma ] ) _ is _ invariant however , so the metric must be of the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 and each of the component functions is independent of @xmath78 .",
    "let us now consider the spatial rotations : @xmath125 the latter in terms of coordinates is @xmath126 the action of conjugation of the hermitian , traceless matrix @xmath127 by a unitary matrix @xmath128 is well known @xcite  it is equivalent to a @xmath104 rotation of : @xmath129 where @xmath130 with components @xmath131 .",
    "the action on the left - invariant 1-forms  is similar . under @xmath132 , @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the same @xmath104 matrix defined above . thus both  and transform as 3-vectors under spatial rotations and as scalars under isorotations .",
    "the metric must be invariant under spatial rotations also , so the task is to construct from , @xmath135 and the most general possible @xmath136 tensor which is scalar under these rotations .",
    "this is @xmath137 @xmath138@xmath139 being 7 unknown functions of @xmath140 only .",
    "the metric may be restricted still further on consideration of a discrete isometry .",
    "the kinetic energy is invariant under the discrete `` parity '' transformations @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "however , neither is an isometry of the moduli space because each reverses the sign of the topological charge , mapping lumps to anti - lumps .",
    "the composite transformation @xmath143 _ is _ an isometry . using the configuration of ( [ eq : dotdef ] ) , @xmath144 in terms of the moduli , @xmath145 is the transformation , @xmath146 this isometry removes two of the terms in ( [ eq : metric ] ) because under it , @xmath147 and @xmath148 so that @xmath149 .",
    "the remaining five functions of @xmath150 are evaluated by choosing convenient orientations for , positions on @xmath115 and tangent vectors ( velocities ) , then calculating the kinetic energy and comparing with ( [ eq : metric ] ) . repeating this four times it is possible to extract the following ( see figure 1 ) : @xmath151 \\\\ \\nonumber c & = & \\frac{\\pi}{2}-2\\pi s_{1}(\\chi ) \\\\",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath153 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath150 , and that @xmath154 .",
    "there appear to be divergences of the functions @xmath138@xmath155 at @xmath156 , but these are in fact removable singularities , so all the limits of vanishing @xmath150 exist .",
    "although @xmath157 and @xmath155 are negative it is straightforward to show that this metric is positive definite , as of course it must be .",
    "the veracity of the statement @xmath158 is established by explicit calculation , there being no obvious symmetry argument in its favour . in summary",
    "then , the metric is @xmath159",
    "before discussing geodesics of the metric ( [ eq : g ] ) we must describe the connexion between a point on the moduli space @xmath160 and its corresponding field configuration .",
    "consider first the 3-dimensional submanifold defined by @xmath161 , parametrized by @xmath162 .",
    "any point in this subspace may be written as @xmath163 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the lump represented by @xmath167 is @xmath168 this is a distorted hedgehog with the arrows pulled towards the north pole .",
    "the larger @xmath150 is , so the larger @xmath153 is and the greater is the distortion .",
    "although it is usual to define the position of a lump as the position of maximum energy density , we shall refer to this as a lump of sharpness @xmath150 located at @xmath169 , the antipodal point to the energy density peak which occurs where the arrows are stretched apart .",
    "obviously the motion of any point is trivially mirrored by its antipodal image , so this terminology makes sense .",
    "the lump represented by  is @xmath170\\odot z \\\\ \\nonumber & = & [ r^{\\dagger}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\lambda$}}'\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}})]\\odot(r\\odot z)=r^{\\dagger}\\odot[w'(r\\odot z)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this configuration is formed by first performing a spatial rotation  taking the  arrow at the old point @xmath51 and placing it at the new point @xmath171 without changing its orientation  then performing the inverse isorotation .",
    "the result looks like the arrows have been fixed to @xmath33  which has then been rotated by @xmath134 which , as defined , has the action on @xmath16 equivalent to @xmath172 , _ not",
    "_ @xmath128 , acting on @xmath0  via @xmath109 . that is , if we define @xmath173 to be stereographic projection , @xmath174@xmath0  so that @xmath175 , then @xmath176",
    ". so the lump at the north pole is shifted to @xmath177 .",
    "all other points on the moduli space are on the isorotation orbit of this submanifold , and isorotation , while changing the internal orientation of the lump , does not move the lump around on physical space .",
    "thus we can always interpret @xmath178 as the lump s position , and @xmath150 as parametrizing its sharpness .",
    "the symmetric hedgehog has @xmath156 , and large @xmath150 lumps have taller , narrower energy density peaks than small @xmath150 lumps .",
    "one way of attacking the geodesic problem is to reduce its dimension by identifying totally geodesic submanifolds , that is , choosing initial value problems whose solution is simplified by some symmetry . the easiest method for identifying such submanifolds",
    "is to find fixed point sets of discrete groups of isometries .",
    "any isometry maps geodesics to geodesics , so if there were a geodesic starting off in the fixed point set of the isometry and subsequently deviating from it , this would be mapped under the isometry to another geodesic , identical to the first throughout its length in the fixed point set , but deviating from the set in a different direction .",
    "this violates the uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations , so no such geodesic may exist . if the initial data are a point on the fixed point set and a velocity tangential to it , then the geodesic must remain on the fixed point set for all subsequent time .    examining ( [ eq : g ] ) we see that @xmath179 is an isometry .",
    "its fixed point set is @xmath115 , the isorotation orbit of the symmetric hedgehog , on which the metric is @xmath180 the kinetic energy is the rotational energy of a totally symmetric rigid body , moment of inertia @xmath181 .",

    "this system can be visualized as a point particle of position dependent mass @xmath202 moving in a potential .",

    "this allows the possibility of potential minima where the forces @xmath206 outwards ( in the sense of increasing @xmath150 ) and @xmath207 inwards are in stable equilibrium .",

    "thus @xmath108 is geodesically incomplete .",
    "this result follows from the rapid vanishing of the inertia to sharpening , @xmath212 , in the large @xmath150 limit ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "for example , consider the simple case @xmath213 and let @xmath214 and @xmath215 be strictly positive .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath216 , the time taken to reach the singular spike is proportional to the following integral : @xmath217 the integrand is finite over the integration range ( even if @xmath218 ) , so if @xmath216 diverges it can only be due to the large @xmath150 behaviour .",
    "but the integrand vanishes like @xmath219 at large @xmath150 , fast enough to ensure convergence .",

    "it is interesting to note that @xmath234 meaning that very tall , sharp lumps can travel uniformly with @xmath235 .",
    "motion with constant @xmath150 and @xmath236 is simply constant speed spatial rotation carrying the lump around a great circle .",
    "so when the extent of the lump s structure is negligible relative to the radius of curvature of @xmath33 , it can travel in analogous fashion to a flat - space @xmath0  lump @xcite .    since @xmath237 takes all positive values ,",
    "whatever value @xmath224 takes there is an equilibrium @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath214 is near this value , then ( assuming @xmath238 is not too large ) the shape of the lump will oscillate periodically about the preferred sharpness , and its speed of travel round the sphere will vary with the same period . if @xmath238 _ is _ too large , or the lump is initially much too spread out for its @xmath224 , then it will escape to the singular spike in finite time .",
    "let us examine the concrete example @xmath239 .",
    "figure 7 shows the potential @xmath226 with its minimum and the lump travel speed @xmath193 as functions of @xmath150 .",
    "we imagine a particle of position dependent mass moving in this potential and for simplicity take @xmath230 .",
    "clearly , if we release the particle with @xmath240 , it will move off to infinity , the last case mentioned above .",
    "but if @xmath241 , oscillatory motion ensues .",
    "even here there are two qualitatively different cases , because @xmath242 has an absolute minimum at @xmath243 , a turning point which is only reached if @xmath244 ( or @xmath245 ) . if @xmath246 then the speed of travel oscillates in simple phase with the lump sharpness , going from fast , spread - out lump to slow , sharp lump and back again .",
    "but if @xmath247 or @xmath245 the speed undergoes an extra wobble during the middle of the sharpness cycle , speeding up then slowing down again as it passes through its maximum sharpness .",
    "this case corresponds to lumps whose shape oscillates more acutely .",
    "other interesting geodesic submanifolds are generated by computing the fixed point sets @xmath248 of the isometries @xmath249 , simultaneous isorotation and spatial rotation by @xmath250 about the @xmath251 and @xmath252 axes respectively : @xmath253 thus if @xmath254  must point along the @xmath252-axis .",
    "on @xmath255 , @xmath256 where @xmath257 $ ] , whereas if @xmath258 then @xmath259 where @xmath260 .",
    "it follows that  also points along the @xmath252-axis , independent of @xmath251 .",
    "the @xmath261 submanifolds are the images of @xmath255 under @xmath262 isorotations about the three axes , so it suffices to solve the geodesic problem on @xmath255  geodesics on @xmath263 , are then obtained by acting with the appropriate isometry .",
    "the choice of @xmath252 does nt matter , and we choose to study the cylinder @xmath264 consisting of lumps of every sharpness located at the north ( south ) pole if @xmath265 ( @xmath266 ) , arbitrarily rotated about the north - south axis . note that @xmath267=0 $ ] on @xmath268 so `` isorotated '' and `` spatially rotated '' mean the same thing in this case .",
    "the kinetic energy on @xmath268 is @xmath269\\ ] ] where once again @xmath270 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath271 , @xmath272 and is constant by virtue of the cyclicity of @xmath271 .",
    "this looks like a particle in one dimension moving in a potential @xmath273 with postion dependent mass . from the potential ( figure",
    "8) we see that all motion is oscillatory and that @xmath274 periodically changes sign . thus a lump set spinning about its own axis will spread out , its rotation slowing , until it is uniformly spread over the sphere , whereupon it will shrink to its mirror image in the opposite hemisphere , regaining its original spin speed as it does so .",
    "the process then reverses and the lump `` bounces '' between antipodal points indefinitely .    defining the new coordinate @xmath275 which takes values in a finite open interval @xmath276 symmetric about @xmath277 ,",
    "the metric on @xmath268 becomes @xmath278 where @xmath279 . since @xmath280",
    ", the manifold may be embedded as a surface of revolution in @xmath27 and geodesics on it can be visualized directly .",
    "figure 9 is a sketch of the embedded surface , which is of finite length and sausage - shaped with its ends pinched to infinitely sharp spikes , the tips of which are the points @xmath281 and so are missing .",
    "the coordinates @xmath282 are geodesic orthogonal coordinates : a curve of constant @xmath271 is a geodesic along the length of the cylinder , lying in a plane containing the cylinder s axis , parametrized by arc length @xmath283 , while a curve of constant @xmath283 is a circle of radius @xmath284 , lying in a plane orthogonal to the cylinder s axis .",
    "two such curves always intersect at right angles .",
    "the spinning geodesics described above wind around the cylinder , never reaching the ends ( this would violate conservation of `` angular momentum '' ) but winding back and forth between two circles @xmath285 , @xmath286 which they touch tangentially .",
    "the angle @xmath287 at which the geodesic intersects the circle @xmath277 determines @xmath288 .",
    "when @xmath289 the geodesic stays on the circle , @xmath290 ( a spinning symmetric hedgehog ) and @xmath291 monotonically increases , tending to the supremum @xmath292 as @xmath287 tends to @xmath293 ( @xmath294 is an irrotational geodesic between antipodal singular spikes ) .",
    "note that the geodesic incompleteness already mentioned appears again , this time characterized by the finite length of the cylinder and the missing points @xmath295 ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "the behaviour of isolated topological solitons in flat space is generally rather trivial , whereas , as we have seen , despite the homogeneity of @xmath16 , the motion of a single lump on the sphere is surprisingly complicated .",
    "it does travel on great circles , but while doing so its shape may oscillate in phase with its speed , whose periodic variation is of one of two types depending on the violence of the shape oscillations , or it may collapse to an infinitely tall , thin spike in finite time . a lump sent spinning about its own axis spreads out then re - forms in the opposite hemisphere , endlessly commuting between antipodal points .",
    "the infinities in the unit - charge metric in flat space can be attributed to the lumps polynomial tail - off : the kinetic energy needed to rigidly spin or scale - deform a lump diverges because such motions involve changing the field at spatial infinity .",
    "the @xmath0  model on any compact space should be free of this problem because the kinetic energy , being an integral over a space of finite volume , must be finite provided the kinetic energy density is non - singular .",
    "conversely , one would expect the singularity to persist in the model defined on hyperbolic space .",
    "the flat - space @xmath0  model can be made more `` physical '' by adding a @xmath296-dimensional version of the skyrme term to stabilize against lump collapse , and a potential to stabilize against spread .",
    "the bogomolnyi bound remains valid but unsaturable .",
    "the potential is somewhat arbitrary , but one interesting possibilty @xcite gives a mass to small amplitude travelling waves of the  field , termed pions in analogy with the skyrme model , and gives the lump an exponential rather than polynomial tail .",
    "this allows the lump to rotate , a problem if one attempts a collective coordinate approximation to low - energy dynamics along the lines recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to restrict the field to the `` bogomonyi regime '' moduli space ( in this the space of static @xmath0  solutions ) , introducing a potential and a perturbed metric ( in @xcite but not @xcite ) to account for the new interactions , which are assumed to be weak .",
    "there seems little hope of perturbing the singular flat - space metric such that rotations become possible , but the problem does not arise on the sphere .",
    "the geodesic approximation could be used to investigate the interaction of two lumps moving on @xmath16 .",
    "right angle scattering in head on collisions emerges naturally from the geodesic approximation of many flat - space models as a consequence of the classical indistinguishability of topological solitons .",
    "it would be interesting to see if there is some analogous behaviour on the sphere .",
    "however , evaluating the two - lump metric could be difficult since the action of the isometry group on the charge-2 moduli space is far less accessible than in the present case .",
    "even in flat space @xcite , the scattering problem is sufficiently complicated to require considerable numerical effort .",
