    "the lamellar phase is one of the possible phases with spatial modulations that can be found in a wide variety of physical and chemical systems .",
    "these include diblock copolymer melts , mixtures of diblock and homopolymers , aqueous solutions of lipids or surfactants , langmuir monolayers , and magnetic garnet films @xcite .",
    "modulated phases are the result of a competition between forces , one of which prefers ordering characterized by a non - zero wavenumber , while the other prefers a homogeneous ( disordered ) state .",
    "below we shall employ the language appropriate to block - copolymers , but our work applies equally to other systems .",
    "we consider diblock copolymer melts in which the two polymer blocks are incompatible .",
    "this incompatibility is characterized by a positive flory parameter @xmath4 .",
    "because of the covalent chemical bond between the a and b blocks , the system can not undergo a true macrophase separation .",
    "instead it undergoes a _ microphase separation _ characterized by a and b  rich domains of a finite size .",
    "various modulated phases such as lamellar , hexagonal , and cubic are observed @xcite depending upon the @xmath4 parameter as well as on the relative lengths of a and b blocks . in most cases ,",
    "the @xmath4 parameter depends inversely on the temperature .",
    "hence , the lamellar and other modulated phases will not be stable at high temperatures and the polymer melt will be in a disordered state .",
    "the equilibrium behavior of diblock copolymers in the bulk is by now well understood @xcite .",
    "single domain bulk phases , however , are rarely observed in experiments because it is extremely difficult to completely anneal defects . in most cases , due to very slow dynamics and energy barriers ,",
    "the microstructural ordering is limited to finite - size domains ( or grains ) separated by grain boundaries .",
    "these defects are very common to block copolymer systems and are readily observed in experiments @xcite .    because these domain boundaries and defects are so abundant in polymer melts , it is of interest to study their energetics and other characteristics .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the relatively simple situation of domain boundaries in lamellar phases in which there is no twist between the two grains , only a tilt , as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the system is translationally invariant along the @xmath5-direction and can be described by its @xmath6-@xmath7 cross - section only , reducing it to an effective two dimensional system . as can be seen in fig .  1a , the distance between lamellae along the grain boundary , @xmath8 , is larger than the lamellae spacing in bulk @xmath9 , by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "this causes an increase in the local free energy density related to the grain boundary .",
    "the experiments of gido and thomas @xcite and hashimoto and coworkers @xcite show that the response of the system to this increase in free energy depends strongly on the tilt angle @xmath0 between the grains .",
    "the so - called _ chevron _ morphology @xcite occurs when the angle is small .",
    "in such a situation , lamellae transform smoothly from one orientation to the other , creating v - shaped tips .",
    "the rounding of these tips reduces the interfacial area between lamellae at the expense of introducing a curvature energy . for block co - polymers the profile shape at the tip is determined by the local relaxation of the stretched chains .",
    "the chevron morphology is shown ( schematically ) in fig .",
    "1b and again in fig .",
    "2a . a gradual transition to an _ omega - shaped _",
    "tip is observed when @xmath11 is increased , as seen in fig .",
    "this morphology is characterized by protrusions of the lamellae along the interface between the two phases .",
    "the protrusions can be understood as a different attempt of the system to reduce the cost of the boundary , while still complying with the geometrical constraints .",
    "essentially the system tries to create a lamella similar to those in the bulk but which is aligned along the interface itself .",
    "the basic phenomenology of these grain boundaries was presented by gido and thomas @xcite .",
    "netz , andelman , and schick@xcite then considered the phenomenon employing a ginzburg - landau free energy which was minimized numerically , and obtained both the chevron and omega morphologies .",
    "matsen@xcite considered the block - copolymer system explicitly and employed self - consistent field theory .",
    "not only did this produce the chevron and omega morphologies for small and intermediate angles , respectively , but also a symmetry - broken omega for large enough angles . in the latter case ,",
    "the response ( and shape ) of lamellae composed of one of the blocks differs from that of the other .",
    "such symmetry broken boundaries were indeed observed by gido and thomas @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we adopt the ginzburg - landau free energy functional employed earlier@xcite . the advantages to using this functional are its simplicity and generality , while retaining the essential ingredients that capture the behavior of the system .",
    "in contrast to the complete minimization of the free energy functional which requires a numerical calculation , we shall employ here a simple ansatz for the form of the grain boundary in order to obtain analytic results .",
    "recently , similar methods were employed to obtain analytically the interface between the lamellar and disordered phases of diblock copolymers @xcite .",
    "our motivation is to demonstrate that the essence of these interesting morphologies does not depend on strong segregation conditions or a large number of fourier components , and so should be observable in all systems with modulated phases .",
    "the chevron structure is obtained by using the bulk lamellar phase solution with a constant amplitude , but with varying wavevector . minimizing the free energy subject to the proper geometrical constraints",
    ", we find an equation for the wavevector .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ chevrons ] . beyond the chevron regime ( _ i.e. _ for large inter - domain angles )",
    ", this approach will not be adequate , because the amplitude of modulations will have to vary as well .",
    "to this end we expand @xmath1 around the two bulk lamellar phases , giving rise to an equation for a small distortion field .",
    "close to the interface , the sharp tips of the lamellar phase ( see fig .",
    "1a ) are smoothed - out and the protrusion characteristic of the omega morphology appears . far away from the interface ,",

    "in addition , very close to the critical point corrections due to fluctuations are important@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the tilt - boundary problem , where two lamellar domains , both lying parallel to the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane , meet with an angle @xmath0 between their normals .",
    "( see fig .",
    "the @xmath6-axis is along the line interface between the two lamellar domains .",

    "( [ u_y ] ) . for large angles ( @xmath149 ) , the omega structure takes over as is shown in fig .  2b , with large protrusions of the lamellae at the interface .",
    "as is explained below , for large angles the excessive packing frustration of the chevrons cost more energy than the omegas .",
    "chevron and omega morphologies are also shown in fig .  3 but with @xmath150 much closer to its critical value of @xmath151 .",
    "as one goes away from the @xmath82 interface , undulations of @xmath146 are encountered .",
    "there are more of them as the order - to - disorder transition ( odt ) is approached , and the omega structure is more evident .",

    "the gray marks the interface between the a and b rich regions .",
    "the equi-@xmath146 lines clearly show the form of the interface in the chevron and omega morphologies .",
    "notice that as the odt is approached ( @xmath150 in fig .  5 ) , there are more undulations apparent on top of the bulk lamellar phase . in the chevron regime ,",
    "the a / b interfacial width remains almost uniform , while in the omega regime it varies close to the kink @xcite .",
    "4 shows quite clearly that the leading and trailing edges of the lamellae are quite different when the angle of the grain boundary is large .",
    "this is emphasized in fig .",
    "6 , for @xmath149 and @xmath155 , the same conditions of the lower plot of fig .",
    "the lines indicate where @xmath156 . that the protrusion at the leading edge is much more pronounced than at the trailing edge is quite reminiscent of the profiles seen in experiment@xcite with one exception",

    "the same data is plotted in a different fashion in fig .",
    "8 . in 8a , @xmath159 is plotted as function of @xmath0 , while in 8b the data is plotted on a log - log plot . from both parts of fig .",

    "[ omegas ] gives a power law with exponent of @xmath160 .",
    "accuracy of the leftmost point of the solid curve in fig .",
    "8b is doubtful , due to poor convergence of the numerical iteration scheme for small angles , @xmath161 .",
    "as the tilt angle grows , deviations from the @xmath162 behavior become larger , and the omega morphology , with its lower energy , appears gradually .    for intermediate and large angles ,",
    "our results are supported by a full numerical solution of this problem @xcite .",
    "presumably , for small angles there is agreement too .",
    "this needs to be further checked since in ref .",
    "@xcite the smallest angle was @xmath163 .",
    "note that in contrast to the full numerical solution in which the order parameter profile was obtained via a functional minimization , here we employed numerical means only to obtain the value of the eigenvalue @xmath102 , while the profile equation was solved analytically .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the @xmath102-vectors found by the use of the iteration scheme , as a function of tilt angle @xmath0 , with @xmath147 fixed . outside of the band - gaps , @xmath102 and @xmath135 are valid solutions , so for clarity only the @xmath102 with @xmath164 is shown .",

    "a check on the imaginary part of @xmath102 in these regions reveals that it is an integer multiple of @xmath166 .",
    "our results agree well with experiment with the exception that we do not obtain the symmetry - breaking transition of the omega morphology@xcite .",
    "to do so , one must add to an ansatz for the order parameter at least a term which varies as @xmath167 , in addition to the fundamental term varying as @xmath168 .",
    "we have used a simple ginzburg - landau free energy functional to investigate the profiles between lamellar phases of diblock copolymer .",
    "our analytic results give good qualitative agreement with experiment in the weak segregation regime , and with full numerical solution of the same free energy model .",
    "the observed chevron morphology develops gradually into an omega morphology for intermediate tilt angles . for small angles",
    ", the use of a periodic order parameter with constant amplitude but varying wavevector suffices to describe the order parameter profile .",
    "this is well described by the chevron morphology . for intermediate angles",
    "the change of the profile at the interface deviates significantly from the bulk , and requires a different treatment .",
    "the deviation from the bulk lamellae was found , and gave rise to the protrusion characterizing the omega morphology .",
    "the symmetry breaking of this phase was not obtained .",
    "we were able to calculate grain - boundary energies and to determine that they scale as the cube of the angle @xcite for small angles .",
    "as the tilt angle grows into the intermediate regime , the profiles deviates continuously from the chevron shape .",
    "as the angle approaches @xmath169 , the energy must go to zero because the grain boundary vanishes at that angle .",
    "this does not occur in our analytic derivation , since , for such large angles , the linearization assumption is no longer valid .",
    "interesting extensions of the present work would describe interfaces of two perpendicular lamellar phases ( so - called _ t - junctions _ ) , interfaces between modulated phases of other symmetries , and the inclusion of a twist instead of a tilt @xcite .",
