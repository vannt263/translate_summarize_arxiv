    "one of the major goals of heavy - ion physics is to gain firm knowledge about the different phases of strongly interacting matter and the transitions between them . at high temperatures , the chiral symmetry that is broken in the qcd vacuum ,",
    "is expected to be restored .",
    "furthermore , quarks and gluons might become the relevant degrees of freedom after the transition from hadrons to a deconfined state of matter . from lattice qcd calculations we know that at vanishing baryochemical potential the chiral transition is an analytic crossover @xcite",
    ". as recent studies show , there seems to be no direct relation between the chiral restoration and the onset of deconfinement @xcite .",
    "a multitude of effective models have been used to investigate the qcd phase diagram @xcite indicating a first order phase transition at large @xmath0 ending at a critical point ( cp ) . in equilibrium",
    "this cp exhibits a divergence in the correlation length of the order parameter .",
    "the problem how to locate the cp in the @xmath1-@xmath0-plane in heavy - ion collisions was addressed by stephanov , rajagopal and shuryak @xcite for equilibrated systems .",
    "they proposed to search for divergences in event - by - event fluctuations of quantities like transverse momentum or particle multiplicity , since the strength of these fluctuations is directly related to the correlation length of the sigma field , the order parameter for the chiral phase transition .",
    "however , a priori one can not expect to reach thermodynamic equilibrium during such a heavy - ion collision , especially near the phase transition where relaxation times become large in comparison to the rapid dynamics of the expanding fireball . therefore , several additional effects have to be taken into account .",
    "not only is the growth of the correlation length naturally limited by the finite size of the system , but also critical slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point will weaken the expected signals @xcite .",
    "one may try to overcome this difficulty by looking for quantities that are accessible in experiment and more sensitive to the correlation length .",
    "higher cumulants and combinations of them like the kurtosis of conserved quantities such as net baryon number or net charge fulfill this requirement @xcite .",
    "the fast dynamical evolution of matter through a first order phase transition may exhibit interesting phenomena like supercooling followed by a decay through spinodal decomposition @xcite or nucleation @xcite .",
    "also an enhancement of soft pions from the decay of a disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) was proposed as a signal for a nonequilibrium chiral phase transition @xcite .    only via thorough theoretical understanding of the processes and effects in dynamical systems undergoing phase transitions one may provide realistic predictions for upcoming experiments with relativistic heavy - ion beams at rhic @xcite , cern sps @xcite , fair @xcite and nica @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of a polyakov loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model were studied and compared with lattice qcd results .",
    "the addition of the polyakov loop to these models improved the behavior of thermodynamic bulk quantities in comparison to the lattice qcd data .",
    "a similar extension to the sigma model with constituent quarks was presented in @xcite where a coincidence of the deconfinement and chiral symmetry transition even at finite @xmath0 was found .",
    "an investigation of the phase structure of that model beyond mean - field has been performed in @xcite including quantum fluctuations within the functional renormalization group method .",
    "this improvement has lead to a quantitative shift in the position of the cp .",
    "furthermore , the authors calculated net - quark number density fluctuations as well as ratios of cumulants as an important means to identify the location of the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions .",
    "the relevance of the fermion vacuum loop for such models has been investigated in @xcite where it was shown that this term has crucial influence on the phase structure and on physical observables such as net quark number fluctuations . in @xcite",
    "an extension of this model to ( 2 + 1 ) flavors together with a comparison with lattice qcd data have been presented .",
    "an alternative model using a dilaton field representing a scalar glueball condensate was subject to studies in @xcite .",
    "an important step towards the understanding of nonequilibrium effects at the chiral phase transition was done in @xcite , where it was shown that the inclusion of spinodal instabilities yields an enhancement of density fluctuations along the first order transition line .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual understanding of thermalized systems where such fluctuations are expected to diverge or grow large only at the cp .    for a better understanding of the processes during a heavy - ion collision nonequilibrium effects",
    "have to be taken into account in the framework of a fully dynamical model .",
    "a promising ansatz to study the qcd phase transition in such a way is given by a chiral fluid dynamics model that has been developed and extended over more than ten years now @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors introduced a model coupling a relativistic ideal fluid of quarks to the linear sigma model and a scalar glueball condensate . later in @xcite",
    "this model was used to study the @xmath2 dimensional fluid dynamic expansion of a plasma droplet coupled to the out - of - equilibrium evolution of the long - wavelength modes of the chiral condensate . there",
    "the initial fluctuations of the sigma field were propagated deterministically . a self - consistent derivation of the coupled dynamics of fields and fluid together with the local thermodynamic properties of the heat bath",
    "was then presented in @xcite .",
    "this step is a crucial improvement as the previous models which propagated the chiral fields using a classical equation of motion neglected relaxational and stochastic processes . as as result",
    ", the fields would never relax to their equilibrium state for a given temperature but continue oscillating . in @xcite ,",
    "the order parameter of chiral symmetry is propagated by a langevin equation to include damping and noise in the heat bath of quarks .",
    "the quark fluid is propagated according to the equations of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the relaxational dynamics of the field and the treatment of the finite size of the heat bath were investigated in @xcite and the first numerical studies of the full expanding system were then presented in @xcite . a coupling of the linear sigma model to viscous hydrodynamics has been studied in @xcite .",
    "dynamical models for the polyakov loop have been proposed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors developed a model for particle production near the deconfinement phase transition due to oscillations in a polyakov loop condensate .",
    "these oscillations were included on the basis of a kinetic term in an effective field theory for a polyakov loop that is biquadratically coupled to a mesonic field .",
    "this idea was further used in @xcite , where the authors showed how explosive behavior at the qcd phase transition might be produced by the decay of such a condensate of polyakov loops .",
    "based on work in @xcite , a langevin equation for the deconfinement order parameter for pure su(2 ) gauge theory was developed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the dissipative interaction with the medium plays a significant role in the determination of physical time scales .    in the present work ,",
    "we connect these ideas of a dynamical polyakov loop with the model of chiral fluid dynamics to take into account effects of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the newly included deconfinement order parameter is treated as an effective field and propagated by a phenomenological langevin equation .",
    "the suggested model is able to provide a dynamic description of two phase transitions in the background of a fluid dynamically expanding heat bath of quarks .",
    "this setup resembles the situation after the collision of two heavy nuclei . in @xcite the proper nonequilibrium dynamics for the sigma field and the quark fluid",
    "have been derived self - consistently for a model without polyakov loop .",
    "the resulting langevin equation for the sigma field includes two important effects : the damping of the chiral field due to the interaction with the heat bath and the back reaction of the heat bath on the sigma field by stochastic noise .",
    "for the dynamics of the polyakov loop we follow the same idea but on a phenomenological basis as it is currently not possible to derive the dynamics of the polyakov loop from a consistent field theoretical approach like it has been achieved for the sigma field . with the considered polyakov loop extended linear sigma model",
    "we are able to describe characteristic phenomena at the phase boundary within a dynamical setup .",

    "our model extends existing studies of chiral fluid dynamics @xcite with the polyakov loop to take into account effects of both the chiral and the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the restoration of @xmath3 chiral symmetry in the high temperature phase can be characterized by the melting of the @xmath4 condensate or the sigma field , respectively . for the transition to deconfinement , the polyakov loop @xmath5 is the quantity of interest .",

    "the expectation value of @xmath5 is related to the free energy @xmath13 of an infinitely heavy test quark at spatial position @xmath14 via @xmath15 in the confined phase , this free energy diverges and therefore @xmath16 vanishes whereas it takes some finite value in the deconfined phase . in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks",
    ", qcd is invariant under @xmath17 center symmetry transformations of the @xmath18 color gauge group .",
    "the polyakov loop transforms as @xmath19 with the consequence that the confined phase is center symmetric while this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the deconfined phase . in the presence of dynamical quarks ,",
    "the polyakov loop is always non - zero as the free energy of a test quark does not diverge anymore .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath16 may still serve to characterize the transition between the two phases .      for our studies we use",

    "one can cure this problem by augmenting this effective potential with a logarithmic term to account for the haar measure in the group integral @xcite . as we will restrict our numerical studies to the case of zero baryochemical potential",

    "the potential ( [ eq : uloop ] ) has a first - order phase transition at a critical temperature of @xmath44  mev .",

    "this is not in general true for the pole mass .",
    "however , we use @xmath77 as an approximation to the proper pole mass for equation ( [ eq : dampcoeff ] ) . this ansatz is justified as the pole mass has a minimum at the transition temperature for a crossover scenario just like the screening mass .",
    "a consistent calculation is possible by considering the dispersion relations for different types of excitations .    for the damping below the phase transition",
    "we choose @xmath78 @xcite to account for the @xmath79 reaction whenever it is kinematically allowed .",
    "[ fig : dampingcoeff ] shows @xmath71 as a function of temperature for both transition scenarios . due to its perturbative derivation ,",
    "the damping coefficient is rather high , especially for the first order transition .",
    "the only region where it vanishes is around @xmath80 for the cp , where the sigma becomes light enough so that @xmath81 .",
    "the stochastic noise field in the equation of motion ( [ eq : eomsigma ] ) has a vanishing expectation value @xmath82 . to complete this part",
    "we derive a dissipation - fluctuation - relation that connects the damping coefficient to the correlator of the stochastic noise field and ensures the relaxation to the proper equilibrium state .",
    "@xmath83    the temperature , the mass of the sigma field , the damping and the noise field in ( [ eq : correlationnoise ] ) are local quantities which may vary between different positions on the spatial grid .",
    "the derivation of the equation of motion for the polyakov loop @xmath5 is more problematic because @xmath5 is defined in the euclidean space and it is not completely clear how to propagate it in real time . in @xcite a kinetic term for the polyakov loop has been included in the lagrangian :    @xmath84    it was proposed that production of pions near the phase transition is driven by oscillations of the polyakov loop . only in the region around @xmath80",
    "the polyakov loop is light , allowing large fluctuations and thus particle production .",
    "as the polyakov loop operator is a phase in color space and therefore @xmath5 a pure number , dimensions in an effective lagrangian can only be made up by powers of the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "however , the temperature in our model is space and time dependent , so the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath5 would contain derivative terms of @xmath1 that might lead to unphysical behavior .    for our present model",
    "we follow a different strategy formulated in @xcite .",
    "if the order parameter is out of equilibrium , then relaxational processes towards its thermodynamic equilibrium value will occur .",
    "the velocity of relaxation is then proportional to the derivative of the effective potential with respect to the order parameter .",
    "analogous to the sigma field we include fluctuations of the polyakov loop with a stochastic noise term for which @xmath85 :    @xmath86    @xmath87    equation ( [ eq : dissfluctpolyakov ] ) assumes gaussian and markovian noise as it was used in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the sigma field it is not clear how to derive a damping for the polyakov loop in a field theoretical manner as the fermionic part of the lagrangian contains interaction with the @xmath10 color gauge field but not directly with @xmath5",
    ". therefore we chose a ` reasonable ' value of @xmath88 , although the results are not sensitive to it .",
    "we will further comment on this later .",
    "the propagation of the quark fluid is governed by the equations of ideal relativistic fluid dynamics @xmath89 we require energy - momentum conservation for the system as a whole , its energy - momentum tensor being split into quark , sigma and polyakov loop parts . in @xcite we were able to derive self - consistently an approximate expression for the quark and sigma contribution .",
    "for the quarks we obtained the energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid , the contribution of the sigma field can be expressed as @xmath90 assuming the same structure and effects for the polyakov loop contribution , we end up with @xmath91 as explained in @xcite , these terms can not account for the average energy transfer from the heat bath to the fields caused by the stochastic noise fields @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the equation of state @xmath94 is obtained and tabulated from the thermodynamic relations @xmath95 a simple relation for @xmath96 can not be obtained as @xmath23 and @xmath5 are propagated explicitly and can be out of equilibrium and the pressure as well as the energy density of the quarks depend explicitly on the local values of these fields .",
    "in this section we study the relaxational behavior of the order parameters in a box of finite size after several temperature quenches .",
    "the aim is to give estimates and compare relaxation times near and far away from the transition point for a first order and a cp scenario .",
    "furthermore we investigate fluctuations during and after the equilibration process .",
    "we solve the equations of motion for the fields and the quark fluid on a fixed spatial cube of size @xmath97 where @xmath98 with @xmath99 equal to the number of cells in each direction and the grid spacing @xmath100  fm .",
    "the fluid dynamic equations ( [ eq : fluiddynamics ] ) are solved using the full ( 3 + 1)d sharp and smooth transport algorithm ( shasta ) ideal fluid dynamic code @xcite . to ensure numerical stability we use a time step of @xmath101  fm .    rewriting the equation of energy and momentum conservation for the coupled system with a source term @xmath102 for the fluid we obtain @xmath103 after performing the fluid dynamical step for vanishing @xmath102 in the standard fashion , we subtract the sources from the energy and momentum density in the global rest frame of the fluid .",
    "this is especially interesting for an expanding medium and has been successfully implemented in previous studies of chiral fluid dynamics simulations without a polyakov loop @xcite . as will be shown later ,",
    "this enables us to conserve the total energy for our polyakov loop extended model , see section [ sec : energy ] .    to implement the source term in the numerical simulation we apply the same strategy as in @xcite .",

    "the energy density of the sigma field is given by the sum of a potential , kinetic and fluctuation term while for the polyakov loop it is associated only with the potential energy due to the lack of a kinetic term in the lagrangian .",

    "after that we let the system evolve according to equations ( [ eq : eomsigma ] ) , ( [ eq : eomell ] ) and ( [ eq : fluiddynamicssource ] ) . fields and fluid now influence each other in the following way : the amount of energy that the fields lose through damping gets transferred to the fluid which causes an adjustment of the temperature on account of equation ( [ eq : temproot ] ) .",
    "this new temperature then reshapes the thermodynamic potential that influences the dynamics of the fields . in this kind of box calculations pressure gradients in the fluid",

    "the barrier that separates minima near @xmath80 is responsible for a significant delay in the relaxation dynamics . for the second order transition we observe critical slowing down",

    "the droplet has a temperature of @xmath149  mev , well above both transition temperatures and is smoothed by a woods - saxon distribution function at its edges : @xmath150 \\big)\\big(1+\\exp[(\\left|z\\right|-l_z)/\\tilde a ] \\big)}~.\\ ] ] here , @xmath151 , @xmath152  fm is the thickness of the transition layer to vacuum and @xmath153 the ellipsoidal parameters are chosen as @xmath154 and @xmath155 , @xmath156  fm denoting the radius of the two nuclei and @xmath157  fm the impact parameter .",
    "the extent in z - direction is @xmath158  fm .",
    "the sigma and polyakov loop fields are initialized with their respective equilibrium distribution , then the energy density and pressure of the quark fluid are calculated .",
    "we choose an initial velocity profile with @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "the transverse velocities @xmath161 and @xmath162 are set to zero in the beginning .",
    "we let the system expand by full @xmath2 dimensional fluid dynamics and check the conservation of the total energy throughout the evolution .",
    "the energy of the sigma and polyakov loop field are given by ( [ eq : energysigmafield ] ) and ( [ eq : energypolyakovfield ] ) .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows the total energy and the partial energies of the quark fluid , the sigma field and the polyakov loop during the fluid dynamical expansion . for both scenarios",
    "the total energy is well conserved until the quark fluid reaches the edges of the computational grid after @xmath163  fm .      during the fluid dynamic expansion",
    "we extract the average temperature @xmath164 , sigma field @xmath165 and polyakov loop @xmath16 in a central cubic volume of @xmath166 inside the hot matter as a function of time .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expfo ] for the first order transition and in fig .",
    "[ fig : expcp ] for a scenario with a cp .",
    "one can observe significant differences in the evolution of the average temperatures between both scenarios : for the case of the first order transition , fig .",
    "[ fig : expfo ] , a reheating occurs after @xmath167  fm as a consequence of the formation of a supercooled phase below the transition temperature .",
    "we see that as the average temperature falls below @xmath80 , the average values of the sigma field and polyakov loop remain close to their high temperature values around @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "this supercooled state decays after about @xmath170  fm to the global minimum and transfers its energy into the fluid which consequently causes an increase in the average temperature .    for the cp scenario ,",
    "[ fig : expcp ] , no reheating effect is observed .",
    "the temperature decreases monotonically with only a small plateau well below the transition temperature where the dynamics slightly slows down due to the flat shape of the effective potential .",
    "the evolution of the averaged fields , especially for @xmath165 , proceeds less rapidly than at the first order phase transition .          in our previous calculations we used the correlation functions ( [ eq : correlationnoise ] ) and ( [ eq : dissfluctpolyakov ] ) assuming that the stochastic noise fields in neighboring cells are not correlated as expressed by the spatial delta function",
    "this leads to results that correspond to averaging over many events , see @xcite .",
    "however , to better understand the differences between the two scenarios it is instructive to compare the microscopic structure of individual events .",
    "this requires a more consistent treatment of the field fluctuations by implementing realistic correlation lengths .",
    "[ fig : corrlength ] shows the correlation length of the sigma field @xmath171 as a function of time for the expansion through both the cp and the first order phase transition . here , @xmath172 is calculated out of the volume averaged temperature in the previous section .",
    "the effect of such an averaging on the correlation length in inhomogeneous systems has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "for the first order transition , @xmath173 lies in a range of @xmath174  fm for the whole evolution while in the cp scenario it reaches a peak of about @xmath175  fm when the system crosses the transition temperature after @xmath176  fm , cf .",
    "[ fig : expcp ] .    below we present results obtained by correlating the noise fields over the spacelike distance @xmath171 in each time step .",
    "the numerical procedure that implements such correlations has been described in @xcite . for each spatial cell",
    "we perform an averaging of the randomly distributed noise field over a surrounding cube of linear size @xmath177 via @xmath178 as this procedure weakens the fluctuations , i.  e. @xmath179 , we have to rescale the noise field in order to obtain again the initial distribution width : @xmath180    an analogous correlation procedure is done for the polyakov loop , correlating @xmath93 over the distance @xmath181 .",
    "the following figures show spatial distributions in the transverse plane ( @xmath182 ) , for the sigma field in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_focp ] , the polyakov loop in fig .  [ fig : loop_focp ] and for the energy density in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_focp ] .",
    "we chose a time of @xmath183  fm for the first order scenario corresponding to the onset of the transition process where @xmath184 , cf .",
    "[ fig : expfo ] . here",
    "we expect to observe phase coexistence , i.  e. domains of the chirally broken phase in the chirally symmetric background or vice versa . for the cp scenario",
    "we chose a time of @xmath176  fm , where again @xmath184 , cf .",
    "[ fig : expcp ] , and furthermore the correlation length reaches its maximum value as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrlength ] . in this scenario",
    "there are no degenerate or metastable phases around @xmath80 but one single equilibrium state for each temperature .",
    "we therefore expect a more regular structure with no domains .    by inspecting the figures we indeed find striking difference between the two transition scenarios . at the first order transition , both the fields and fluid evolve irregularly .",
    "this effect is best observed in the sigma field , fig .  [ fig : sigma_fo_t4 ] , where one can see the expected domains of the chirally broken phase embedded in the chirally symmetric background , see for instance the region around @xmath185 . here",
    ", the system produces large fluctuations in small spatial regions that are able to overcome the potential barrier and create these characteristic structures",
    ". nevertheless , the different phases are connected smoothly , there are no sharp boundaries between the domains .",
    "this is a result of the laplacian in the equation of motion which smoothens the gradients .",
    "also in the polyakov loop , fig .",
    "[ fig : loop_fo_t4 ] , and even more in the energy density , fig .",
    "[ fig : e_fo_t4 ] , we observe a bumpy and irregular structure .",
    "regions of high energy density are embedded in a background of lower energy density in the periphery , like for instance around @xmath186 .",
    "these embedded regions are then going to grow and merge , leaving small islands of the symmetric phase which gradually shrink until the whole system is in the low temperature chirally broken phase .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution through the cp proceeds smoothly , the regular ellipsoidal structure is preserved . especially at the transition point , where the correlation length grows large",
    ", we see a smooth shape in both the fields and the energy density of the quark fluid , see figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma_cp_t32 ] , [ fig : loop_cp_t32 ] and [ fig : e_cp_t32 ] .",
    "this striking difference in the event structure should manifest itself in the experimental data , e.  g. in the non - statistical multiplicity fluctuations of produced hadrons @xcite .",
    "we presented a fully dynamical model to study the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions of qcd simultaneously . in our previous studies of chiral fluid dynamics",
    "we have derived the coupled dynamics of the sigma field and the quark heat bath within a self - consistent 2pi effective action approach .",
    "the results were now extended for the polyakov loop so that both order parameters are propagated via langevin equations taking into account the interaction with the quark heat bath via dissipation and noise .",
    "we assume that the structure of the source term for the polyakov loop is analogous to that for the sigma field . during all simulations",
    "the total energy is well conserved .",
    "we studied the relaxational behavior of the coupled system for different quench scenarios in a box .",
    "for both the first order and the cp scenario , relaxation near the transition point is delayed . at the first order phase transition the relaxation process is significantly delayed due to the barrier in the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the transition actually starts only when this barrier disappears . near the cp ,",
    "when the sigma mass drops to zero and therefore the damping vanishes , we observe perpetual oscillations of the sigma field around the equilibrium value .",
    "these fluctuations are also visible in the polyakov loop , although with a small amplitude . performing a fourier analysis of the fluctuations for both order parameter fields we have observed another interesting peculiarity . while during the transition process the intensity of fluctuations is much stronger in a first order than in a cp scenario , the soft modes are stronger enhanced near the cp as compared with the first order transition if the systems are allowed to equilibrate .    for the evolution of an expanding fluid through the first order transition we have found a clear evidence for the formation of a supercooled phase .",
    "its decay later on leads to a substantial reheating of the quark fluid .",
    "that is in contrast to the simulation with a cp where the temperature decreases monotonically .",
    "furthermore , during the onset of the first order transition , small domains of different phases coexist and create inhomogeneities in the energy density . in the cp scenario , where the correlation length grows large near the critical temperature",
    ", we observe a more homogeneous structure in the fields and fluid .",
    "a detailed analysis of domain formation at the first order phase transition will be provided in future work .",
    "furthermore , we will extend this model to finite baryochemical potential and study trajectories in the full @xmath1-@xmath187-plane as well as fluctuations of baryon number densities .",
    "we think about several extensions and refinements of the model . the damping coefficient for the sigma field should include not only the @xmath188 decay but also the decay into pions .",
    "the soft modes which are linked to the order parameter of the chiral transition are furthermore affected by interaction with the hard modes which would give another contribution to the heat bath and the dissipation process . for the polyakov loop we used a purely phenomenological langevin equation with a constant damping coefficient .",
    "this needs improvement , for instance by extracting this term from monte carlo simulations like it has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the present studies will allow for a better quantitative understanding of the signatures of the cp especially at fair energies .",
