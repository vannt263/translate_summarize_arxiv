    "one possible way to avoid the sign problem is to simply abandon monte carlo simulation .",
    "levin and nave proposed the tensor renormalization group ( trg ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they study two - dimensional classical systems .",
    "this method has no sign problem because it does not consider the boltzmann weight as a probability of generating field configurations .",
    "this method makes it possible to calculate the partition function approximately based on the singular value decomposition .",
    "the trg method comprises mainly two steps .",
    "the first step is to construct a tensor network representation of the partition function .",
    "the detail is described in the next section .",
    "the second step is to decrease the number of tensors under control of systematic errors .",
    "after that , one can finally compute the partition function approximately by contracting all indices of a few coarse grained tensors . while the original trg was a method studying two - dimensional systems , xie _",
    "et al._@xcite introduced the higher - order trg ( hotrg ) as an extension to higher - dimensional systems , which is based on the higher - order singular value decomposition .",
    "one example of systems having the sign problem is a system including the @xmath1 term .",
    "the qcd lagrangian naturally includes this term , which breaks cp symmetry .",
    "@xmath1 is a free parameter ; for example , it takes from 0 to 2@xmath4 . from the experiment of the neutron",
    "electric dipole moment , however , the parameter has the upper bound @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "why is the free parameter @xmath1 so small ?",
    "this puzzle is the so - called strong cp problem . in order to answer the question , lattice qcd simulation including",
    "the @xmath1 term is desirable , but the presence of the @xmath1 term causes the sign problem .    instead of approaching qcd directly",
    ", it is reasonable to start to investigate its toy model , the cp(@xmath0 ) model , which shares many features with qcd and has the @xmath1 term too .",
    "a long time ago , schierholz suggested an interesting scenario to solve the strong cp problem in the cp(@xmath0 ) model by analyzing the phase diagram in the @xmath3 - @xmath1 plane @xcite . in the phase diagram",
    ", there are two phases , the confining phase and deconfinement phase ( higgs phase ) , which are distinguished by observing `` flattening '' of free energy , and it was argued that in the continuum limit , if @xmath6 is the only choice in the confining phase , the strong cp problem would be resolved . to confirm this result , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite also investigated the similar phase diagram by a similar way as schierholz , where they used the monte carlo method and computed the partition function in the presence of the @xmath1 term @xmath7 by computing the topological charge distribution @xmath8 .",
    "however , they insisted that the main reason of the `` flattening '' of free energy is due to the statistical fluctuation of @xmath8 in their analysis . on the other hand , plefka and",
    "samuel @xcite supported schierholz s result by using another method , the strong coupling expansion , but they could not confirm whether @xmath1 must be taken to zero in the continuum limit since they truncated higher - order corrections . although it is not clear that the solution can be directly applied to qcd , it is interesting to verify the scenario with another method , namely the trg approach which is free of the sign problem .",
    "moreover , this method can drastically reduce the truncation error in an expansion of @xmath3 .    in particular , the cp(1 ) model , which is equivalent to the o(3 ) model ,",
    "is interesting since it is connected with a verification of the haldane conjecture @xcite : the two - dimensional o(3 ) nonlinear sigma model with @xmath9 is gapless . in order",
    "to prove this conjecture , monte carlo simulations for the o(3 ) model with the @xmath1 term were conducted in various methods . in spite of the presence of the sign problem ,",
    "the extended cluster algorithm @xcite and the refined analysis @xcite made the calculation feasible . as a result , the second - order phase transition at @xmath9 was found and it was shown that the observed critical exponents belong to the universality class of the wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) model with a topological coupling @xmath10 @xcite as expected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the phase structure of the two - dimensional cp(1 ) model in the presence of the @xmath1 term was also investigated by the monte carlo simulation @xcite . the universality class , however , turned out to be different from that of the wznw model .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to assess the universality class and reanalyze the phase structure by using the sign - problem - free method , i.e. , tensor renormalization group methods .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to apply the hotrg to the cp(@xmath0 ) model in two dimensions .",

    "[ 3 ] we show the numerical results at @xmath6 , and in sec .  [ 4 ] we give our conclusions .",
