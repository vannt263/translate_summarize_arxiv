    "several methods are known to exactly solve the einstein and einstein - maxwell field equations , or to generate new exact solutions from simple known solutions @xcite .",
    "however , the above mentioned methods in general lead to solutions without a clear physical interpretation or to solutions that depend of many parameters without a clear physical meaning .",
    "accordingly , it is of importance to have some appropriate procedures to obtain physical interpretations of these exact solutions .",
    "so , in the past years such procedures have been developed for static and stationary axially symmetric solutions in terms of thin and , more recently , thick disc models .",
    "stationary or static axially symmetric exact solutions of einstein equations describing relativistic thin discs are of great astrophysical importance since they can be used as models of certain stars , galaxies and accretion discs .",
    "these were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , obtaining pressureless static discs , and then by morgan and morgan , obtaining static discs with and without radial pressure @xcite . in connection with gravitational collapse",
    ", discs were first studied by chamorro , gregory , and stewart @xcite .",
    "discs with radial tension have been also studied @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static and stationary thin discs have been obtained by different authors , with or without radial pressure ( see refs .",
    "@xcite to @xcite ) . except for the pressureless disks all the other disks have as source matter with azimuthal pressure ( tension ) different from the radial pressure ( tension )",
    ". however , in some cases these disks can be interpreted as the superposition of two counterrotating perfect fluids .",
    "a detailed study of the counterrotating model for the case of static thin disks is presented in @xcite .",
    "recently , more realistic models of thin disks and thin disks with halos made of perfect fluids were considered in @xcite .",
    "disc sources for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with magnetic fields are also of astrophysical importance mainly in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "although discs with electric fields do not have clear astrophysical importance , their study may be of interest in the context of exact solutions .",
    "thin discs have been discussed as sources for kerr - newman fields @xcite , magnetostatic axisymmetric fields @xcite , conformastationary metrics @xcite , and electrovacuum static counterrotating discs @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite the resulting discs can be interpreted either as rings with internal pressure and currents or as two counterrotating streams of freely moving charged particles , i.e. , which move along electrogeodesics ( solution to the geodesic equation in the presence of a lorentz force ) .    in all the above cases ,",
    "the discs are obtained by an `` inverse problem '' approach , called by synge the `` _ g - method _ ''",
    "the method works as follows : a solution of the vacuum einstein equations is taken , such that there is a discontinuity in the derivatives of the metric tensor on the plane of the disc , and the energy - momentum tensor is obtained from the einstein equations .",
    "the physical properties of the matter distribution are then studied by an analysis of the surface energy - momentum tensor so obtained .",
    "very recently the above procedure has been generalized in order to obtain thick disc models @xcite and also non - axisymmetric planar distributions of charged dust @xcite . as we can see , by this `` inverse problem '' approach we can do physical interpretations of many known solutions of the einstein and einstein - maxwell vacuum equations , in the sense that the thin disks can act as exact sources for the space - time metrics given by the vacuum solutions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the interpretation of some static electrovacuum spacetimes in terms of counterrotating perfect fluid discs . in order to do such interpretation ,",
    "a detailed study is presented of the counterrotating model ( crm ) for generic electrovacuum static axially symmetric relativistic thin discs with nonzero radial pressure .",
    "the counterrotating model for the case of static thin discs with radial pressure was recently studied in @xcite and for static discs without radial pressure but without electromagnetic field in @xcite , so the material presented here is a continuation of the mentioned works .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discs ] , we present a summary of the procedure to construct models of discs with nonzero radial pressure . we obtain expressions for the surface energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density of the disc .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : crm ] , the discs are interpreted in terms of the crm . we find a general constraint over the counterrotating tangential velocities needed to cast the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disc as the superposition of two counterrotating charged perfect fluids .",
    "we also find expressions for the energy density , pressure , current density , and tangential velocity of the counterrotating fluids .",
    "we show that , in general , it is not possible to take the two counterrotating fluids as circulating along electrogeodesics nor take the two counterrotating tangential velocities as equal and opposite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : examp ] , four simple families of models of counterrotating charged discs based on chazy - curzon - type , zipoy - voorhees - type , bonnor - sackfield - type , and charged and magnetized darmois metrics are presented where we obtain some discs with a well behaved crm .",
    "in particular , we study the tangential velocities , energy and electric charge densities in the particular case when both streams have equal pressure or equal energy density .",
    "also the stability against radial perturbation is analyzed . finally , in sec .",
