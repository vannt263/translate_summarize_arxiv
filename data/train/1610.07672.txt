    "third , none of these finite - blocklength analyses treats the case of multiple power beacons .",
    "this paper is an extension of our conference paper @xcite , where limited analytical results were provided for the case of a single power beacon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is described in section [ secsys ] .",

    "simulation results are provided in section [ secsim ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ secconc ] .",
    "we consider a wireless - powered communication system where one or more wireless power beacons ( pbs ) use wireless energy transfer to charge an energy harvesting ( eh ) node , which then attempts to communicate with another receiver ( rx ) using the harvested energy ( see fig . [",

    "we present an analytical treatment for two cases : i ) the energy harvesting node is powered by a single power beacon , and ii ) the energy harvesting node is powered by a large - scale network consisting of multiple power beacons .",
    "we now describe the system model for the case of a single power beacon .",
    "any additional description for the case of multiple power beacons will be provided in section [ secmp ] .",
    "we assume that the energy harvester uses a _",
    "save - then - transmit _",
    "protocol @xcite to enable wireless - powered communications .",
    "the considered protocol divides the communication frame consisting of @xmath0 channel uses ( or slots ) into an energy harvesting phase having @xmath1 channel uses , and an information transmission phase having @xmath2 channel uses .",
    "the first @xmath1 channel uses are used for harvesting energy from the rf signals transmitted by the power beacon , which is then saved in a ( sufficiently large ) energy buffer .",
    "this is followed by an information transmission phase consisting of @xmath2 channel uses , where the transmitter uses the harvested energy to transmit information to the receiver .",
    "we call @xmath1 the _ harvest _ blocklength , @xmath2 the _ transmit _ blocklength , and @xmath3 the _ total _ blocklength or frame size",
    ". we will conduct the subsequent analysis for the non - asymptotic blocklength regime , i.e. , for the practical case of _ short packets _ where the total blocklength is finite .",
    "[ t ]          the signal transmitted by a power beacon experiences distance - dependent path loss and channel fading before reaching the energy harvesting node .",
    "the harvested energy is , therefore , a random quantity due to the underlying randomness of the wireless link .",

    "note that we have ignored the energy due to noise since it is negligibly small .",
    "we consider quasi - static block flat rayleigh fading for the pb - eh links such that the channel remains constant over ( the harvesting phase of ) a frame , and randomly changes to a new value for the next frame .",

    "this is motivated by the observation that the harvest blocklength in a _ short - packet _ communication system would typically be smaller than the channel coherence time",
    ".      the energy harvesting phase is followed by an information transmission phase where the eh node attempts to communicate with a destination rx node over an unreliable awgn channel .",

    "note that the overall performance is marred by two key events .",
    "first , due to lack of sufficient energy , the eh node may not be able to transmit the intended codewords during the information transmission phase , possibly causing a decoding error at the receiver .",
    "second , due to a noisy eh - rx channel , the received signal may not be correctly decoded . for the former ,",
    "we define a metric called the _ energy supply probability _ , namely , the probability @xmath60 $ ] that an eh node can support the intended transmission . for the latter ,",
    "we define and characterize the _ @xmath53-achievable rate _ in the finite blocklength regime .",
    "in this section , we characterize the energy supply probability and the achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime for an energy harvester powered by a single power beacon . we also provide closed - form analytical expressions for the optimal transmit power .",

    "similarly , we define @xmath64 as the _ energy outage probability _ at the energy harvesting node .",

    "assuming @xmath71 , the last equation follows from the definition of the moment generating function of a chi - squared random variable .",
    "while proposition 1 is valid for @xmath71 , we note that this is the case of practical interest since it is desirable to operate at @xmath77 , as evident from section [ secsim ] .",
    "further , the expression in ( [ eq : p_ec single pb ] ) makes intuitive sense as the energy outages would increase with the transmit blocklength @xmath2 for a given @xmath1 , and decrease with the harvest blocklength @xmath1 for a given @xmath2 .",
    "let us fix @xmath18 and @xmath69 .",

    "the energy supply probability is more sensitive to the length of the transmit phase compared to that of the harvest phase .",
    "this observation also manifests itself in terms of the energy requirements at the transmitter .",
    "for instance , to maintain an energy supply probability @xmath79 , it follows from ( [ eq : p_ec single pb ] ) that the power ratio satisfies @xmath80 .",
    "note that the power ratio varies only linearly with the harvest blocklength @xmath1 , but superlinearly with the transmit blocklength @xmath2 .",
    "this further implies that for a fixed @xmath2 , doubling the harvest blocklength relaxes the transmit power budget by the same amount .",
    "that is , the energy harvester can double its transmit power @xmath18 ( and therefore the channel snr ) without violating the required energy constraints .",
    "in contrast , reducing the transmit blocklength for a given @xmath1 brings about an exponential increase in the transmit power budget at the energy harvester .",
    "the following corollary treats the scaling behavior of the energy supply probability as the blocklength becomes large .",
    "when the harvest blocklength @xmath1 scales in proportion to the transmit blocklength @xmath2 such that @xmath81 for some constant @xmath82 , the energy supply probability @xmath61 converges to a limit as @xmath2 becomes asymptotically large .",
    "in other words , @xmath83 such that the limit only depends on the power ratio @xmath84 and the proportionality constant @xmath82 . further , under proportional blocklength scaling , this limit also serves as an upper bound on the energy supply probability for finite blocklengths , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "the previous corollary also shows that energy outage is a fundamental bottleneck regardless of the blocklength , assuming at best linear scaling .",

    "this interplay between the transmit and harvest blocklength results in a trade - off between the energy supply probability and the communication reliability . for the rest of the analysis",

    "further , the scaling rate @xmath105 is directly proportional to the power ratio @xmath87 and inversely proportional to the error @xmath53 . for example , fix @xmath2 and @xmath87 .",

    "this increase in reliability , however , comes at the expense of a reduced rate and an increased latency since the harvesting overhead is @xmath107 and the total blocklength grows as @xmath108 .",

    "this is because the wireless energy transfer link may fade completely , resulting in a transmission outage for the information transfer link .    as the power ratio @xmath128 in ( [ eq : prop2 ] ) , the asymptotic achievable rate converges to the capacity of a non - energy harvesting awgn channel , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
