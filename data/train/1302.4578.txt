    "the avogadro constant , @xmath0 , is determined by dividing the molar volume of a silicon single - crystal highly enriched with @xmath1si by its unit cell volume , obtained from the measured value of the lattice parameter @xcite .",
    "the lattice parameter is measured by means of combined x - ray and optical interferometry .",
    "recently , the effect of surface stress was brought to our attention as a possible error source in our measurement of the lattice parameter @xcite .",
    "indeed , this issue was already taken into account but never definitely investigated @xcite . an intrinsic surface - stress exists in solid , in a similar way",
    "as it occurs in liquids , which was first modelled by gibbs @xcite and shuttleworth @xcite , whose works were seminal in surface thermodynamics .",
    "though it is widely reported in review papers and textbooks on surface science @xcite , their theory is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "a continuous mechanics theory of solid surfaces has been developed by gurtin and murdoch @xcite , which is summarized in @xcite .",
    "when the surface relaxes , it compresses or pulls the underlying crystal ; since the resulting lattice strain depends on the crystal size and geometry , the lattice parameter of an x - ray interferometer is different from that of the si spheres used to determine the molar volume .    after summarizing the operation of a combined x - ray and optical interferometer",
    ", this paper investigates the effect of surface stress on the interferometer operation .",
    "an elastic membrane model has been used to provide a surface load in a finite element analysis of the lattice strain .",
    "particular emphasis was given to the operation of the @xmath1si interferometer used to determine @xmath0 .",
    "eventually , a measurement of the lattice parameter with a variable - thickness interferometer is proposed in order to evidence the effect of surface stress on the underlying crystal .",
    "a review of the lattice parameter measurement can be found in @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ xint ] , an x - ray interferometer consists of three si crystal slabs so cut that the \\{220 } planes are orthogonal to the crystal surfaces .",
    "x - rays from a 17  kev  mo  k@xmath2 source are split by the first crystal and recombined , via two transmission crystals , by the third , called the analyser . when the analyser is moved in a direction orthogonal to the \\{220 } planes , a periodic intensity - variation of the transmitted and diffracted x - rays",
    "is observed , the period being the diffracting - plane spacing , about 192  pm .",
    "the analyser embeds front and rear mirrors , so that its displacement and rotations can be measured by an optical interferometer .",
    "the measurement equation is @xmath3 , where @xmath4  pm is the spacing of the \\{220 } planes and @xmath5 is the number of x - ray fringes observed in a displacement of @xmath6 optical fringes having period @xmath7  nm . to ensure the interferometer calibration",
    ", the laser source operates in single - mode and its frequency is stabilized against that of a transition of the @xmath8i@xmath9 molecule . to eliminate the adverse influence of the refractive index of air and to achieve millikelvin temperature uniformity and stability ,",
    "the experiment is carried out in a thermovacuum chamber .",
    "continuous developments led the measurement sensitivity and accuracy to approach @xmath10 ; the most recent results are given in @xcite .",
    "similarly to liquid surfaces , solid surfaces exhibit a stress also if the bulk material is stress - free .",
    "this is the macroscopic consequence of atomic affects : roughly speaking , the atoms on the surface lose half of the bonds they would have in the bulk ; therefore , crystal surfaces are disturbances in the bonding of atoms .",
    "surface stress was first generalized to solids by gibbs and shuttleworth @xcite as the amount of reversible work per unit area needed to stretch a pre - existing surface . since a solid surface may change not only by exchange of matter with the bulk , but also by elastic deformation , the concept of surface stress must be derived from the molecular dynamics of the surface @xcite .",
    "continuum mechanics provides the framework to define the surface properties and the relationships among them . the elasticity theory of solid surfaces to which we refer was developed by gurtin and murdoch @xcite .",
    "a summary of the linearised theory  which is valid when both the surface and bulk strains are small  is given in @xcite .",
    "the key concept is that , for a surface attached to the underlying solid , a stress - free reference does not exist ; since the bonds between the surface atoms and between the bulk atoms are different , the surface of a stress - free crystal has residual strain , @xmath11 , and stress , @xmath12 .",
    "if the surface tends to shrink ( expand ) with respect to the bulk , the surface stress is positive ( negative ) and it is said to be tensile ( compressive ) . since a fully relaxed surface has no normal stress , surface strain and stress are second rank tensors , which are characterized by two principal orthogonal - components .",
    "if the surface has more than a 2-fold symmetry , the surface stress and strain tensors are isotropic . in this case , @xmath13 and the free surface - energy per unit area is @xcite @xmath14[free ] where @xmath15 are the strain component in the plane tangent to the surface , @xmath16 is the surface energy for a stress - free bulk , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are elastic constants , and the summation over the repeated indices ",
    "@xmath19  is implied . the definition of surface stress is @xmath20 ; hence , by taking the derivatives , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the intrinsic surface stress .",

    "a measurement of the polar dependence of the relative surface - stress at high temperature ( 1373 k ) is given in @xcite , which allows the surface stress of any surface to be determined from that of the ( 001 ) reference surface .",
    "in the case of our x - ray interferometer , the @xmath53 surfaces are those of main interest ; because of their 2-fold symmetry , two values are necessary to represent the surface stress of the two perpendicular @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] components .",

    "the crystal s surfaces are normally covered by a few nanometre thick oxide - layer , which can further stress the surface .",
    "the stress changes of the si(001 ) @xmath52 surface during plasma oxidation were measured by using a thin silicon cantilever ; the bending caused by the oxidation of one face was optically measured and related to the surfaces stress difference by elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "initially , the oxidation induces a compressive stress , followed by a tensile stress ; eventually , the stress variation turns to compressive for oxide thickness greater than about 1.5  nm .",
    "the initial stress changes were explained in terms of the electron diffusion into the sample and the shrinkage caused by the oxygen - bridged dimer structure . the final compressive variation , @xmath58",
    "n / m , was explained by the oxidation of si atoms at deep sites ; since the oxygen expands the si ",
    "si bond , oxidation is expected to cause a compressive stress .",
    "the surface relaxes the intrinsic stress by compressing or pulling the underlying crystal .",
    "for instance , the ( isotropic ) lattice strain of a sphere of radius @xmath59 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the bulk modulus and the young - laplace approximation holds when the elastic constants can be neglected when compared to the @xmath62 product . by choosing @xmath63  n / m , we can use this formula  where @xmath64  mm and @xmath65  gpa  to estimate the lattice strain of the spheres used to determine @xmath0 .",
    "the result is @xmath66  nm / m , which is irrelevant for the @xmath0 determination .",
    "however , if @xmath67  mm  which is a value equal to the thickness of the crystal used to measure the lattice parameter  we obtain @xmath68  nm / m , which is significant with respect to the uncertainty of the lattice - parameter measurement .",
    "figure  [ analyser ] ( left ) shows the analyser crystal of the @xmath1si x - ray interferometer used for the @xmath0 measurement and its crystallographic orientation .",
    "the end mirrors are parallel to the diffracting planes ; to avoid stress propagation , they are separated by vertical cuts .",
    "the lamella thickness , 1.2  mm , was chosen by a trade off between the increased lattice strain ( due to the surface stress ) of a thin lamella and the increased x - ray absorption of a thick lamella .    to estimate the lattice parameter change caused by the surface stress",
    ", we used a commercial finite element analysis software @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ analyser ] , the ( 220 ) planes are orthogonal to the lamella faces which are parallel to @xmath53 planes .",
    "owing the large uncertainty of the residual stress values , though the @xmath53 surfaces are anisotropic , the analyser surfaces were modelled as stretched by isotropic membranes attached to the underlying crystal lattice . since we are only concerned with infinitesimal strains , though the surface stress @xmath69 depends on the strain according to ( [ stress ] ) , we used an isotropic @xmath63  n / m value .",
    "this surface stress value allows the analysis results to be easily scaled if a different value has to be considered and , hopefully , it is larger than the actual stress value .",
