    "in recent years the galactic center has been explored extensively over most of the electromagnetic spectrum , revealing complex structures and a multitude of intriguing physical phenomena . at the center",
    "lies a @xmath6 solar mass ( ) black hole @xcite .",
    "the presence of a water - rich dust ring at about one parsec from sgra * .",
    "further underscores the complexity of this region , as does the presence within the central parsec of a few million year old population of very massive ofpe / wn9 @xcite and luminous blue variable stars .",
    "these young stars may indicate recent star formation in the central region @xcite , or they may have migrated inward from larger distances to their current locations @xcite . in addition , the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory has detected an unusually large number ( @xmath7 ) of hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) point sources within 23pc of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "seven of these sources are transients , and are conjectured to contain stellar - mass black holes @xcite ; some may even harbor imbhs @xcite .",
    "the galactic center is a dynamic environment , where young stars and star clusters form in molecular clouds or thick dusty rings @xcite , and interact with their environment .",
    "several star clusters are known to exist in this region @xcite , and the star formation rate in the inner bulge is estimated to be comparable to that in the solar neighborhood @xcite , enough to grow the entire bulge over the age of the galaxy .    of particular interest here are the several star clusters discovered within @xmath8pc of the galactic center , 11 of which have reliable mass estimates .",
    "most interesting of these are the two dense and young ( @xmath9myr ) star clusters arches @xcite and the quintuplet@xcite , and the recently discovered groups irs13e and irs16sw @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the relation between the star clusters in the inner @xmath8pc of the galactic center and , to some extend , the partial formation of the central supermassive black hole .",
    "in particular we simulate the evolution of the star clusters born over a range of distances from the galactic center .",
    "while we follow their internal dynamical evolution we allow the star clusters to spiral inwards towards the galactic center until they dissolve in the background . during this process",
    "a runaway collision may have occurred in the cluster and we follow the continuing spiral - in of the resulting intermediate mass black hole .    our prescription for building an intermediate mass black hole has been well established in numerous papers concerning stellar collision runaways in dense star clusters .",
    "we just build on these earlier results for our description of the collision runaway and the way in which it leads to the formation of a black hole of intermediate mass .",
    "eventually the imbhs merge with the supermassive black hole , building the smbh in the process .",
    "this model was initially proposed by @xcite , and here we validate the model by detailed simulations of the dynamical evolution of individual star clusters and the final spiral - in of the imbh toward the smbh . using the results of the direct n - body simulations we calibrate a semi - analytic model to simulate a population of star clusters which are born within @xmath8pc over the age of the galaxy .",
    "a substantial fraction of stars are born in clusters and these have a power - law stellar mass functions fairly well described by a `` salpeter '' exponent of -2.35 , and with stellar masses ranging from the hydrogen burning limit ( @xmath10 ) or a bit above @xcite to an upper limit of @xmath11 or possibly as high as 150@xcite .",
    "the massive stars start to sink to the cluster center immediately after birth , driving the cluster into a state of core collapse on a time scale @xmath12 @xcite , where @xcite @xmath13 } \\right)^{3/2 }                            \\left ( { m \\over [ { \\mbox{${\\rm m}_\\odot$ } } ] } \\right)^{-1/2 }       { n \\over { \\mbox{${\\log \\lambda}$}}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the cluster mass , @xmath15 is its half - mass radius , @xmath16 is the number of stars , and @xmath17 . in sufficiently compact clusters",
    "the formation of a dense central subsystem of massive stars may lead to a `` collision runaway , '' where multiple stellar mergers result in the formation of an unusually massive object .",
    "if the mass of this runaway grows beyond @xmath18 it collapses to an imbh without losing significant mass in a supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "recently , this model has been applied successfully to explain the ultraluminous x - ray source associated with the star cluster mgg-11 in the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "this model for creating an intermediate mass black hole in a dense star cluster was adopted by @xcite , who continued by studying the evolution of massive @xmath19 star clusters within about 60pc from the galactic center .",
    "their conclusions are consistent with the earlier @xmath0-body models @xcite and analytic calculations @xcite in that massive clusters can reach the galactic center but in doing so they populate the inner few parsecs with a disproportionately large number of massive stars .",
    "the main requirement for a successful collision runaway is that the star cluster must experience core collapse ( i ) before the most massive stars explode as supernovae ( @xmath20myr ) and ( ii ) before the cluster dissolves in the galactic tidal field .",
    "the collisional growth rate slows dramatically once the runaway collapses to an imbh .",
    "we estimate the maximum runaway mass achievable by this process as follows . for compact clusters ( @xmath21 myr ) , essentially all the massive stars reach the cluster core during the course of the runaway , and the runaway mass scales with the cluster mass : @xmath22 @xcite . for systems with longer relaxation times ,",
    "only a fraction of the massive stars reach the core in time and the runaway mass scales as @xmath23 @xcite ( see their eq .",
    "the relaxation based argument may result in higher mass runaways in star clusters with a very small relaxation time compared to the regime studied in monte carlo n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "a convenient fitting formula combining these scalings , calibrated by n - body simulations for salpeter - like mass functions , is @xcite @xmath24 early dissolution of the cluster reduces the runaway mass by prematurely terminating the collision process .    as core collapse proceeds ,",
    "the orbit of the cluster decays by dynamical friction with the stars comprising the nuclear bulge .",
    "the decay of a circular cluster orbit of radius @xmath25 is described by ( see [ eq .  7 - 25 ] in @xcite , or @xcite for the more general case ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the mass within a distance @xmath25 from the galactic center and we take @xmath30 @xcite . numerical solution of this equation is required due to the complicating effects of stellar mass loss , which drives an adiabatic expansion of the cluster , and by tidal stripping , whereby the cluster mass tends to decrease with time according to @xmath31 , @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is the initial mass of the cluster , @xmath33 is the cluster age in terms of the instantaneous relaxation time ( ) within the jacobi radius , and @xmath34 is the time scale for cluster disruption : @xmath35 .",
    ", where is the cluster crossing time @xcite . the constant @xmath36 may be obtained from direct n - body simulations of star clusters near the galactic center @xcite , resulting in @xmath37 , with and expressed in myr . ]    even after the bulk of the cluster has dissolved , a dense stellar cusp remains surrounding the newborn imbh , and accompanies it on its descent toward the galactic center .",
    "the total mass of stars in the cusp is typically comparable to that of the imbh itself @xcite and it is composed predominantly of massive stars , survivors of the population that initiated the core collapse during which the imbh formed .",
    "eventually even that cusp slowly decays by two - body relaxation @xcite , depositing a disproportionately large number of massive stars and the orphaned imbh close to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the imbh merges with the smbh .",
    "we have performed extensive direct n - body calculations to test the validity of the general scenario presented above , and to calibrate the semi - analytic model .",
    "our analysis combines several complementary numerical , analytical and theoretical techniques in a qualitative model for the formation and evolution of the nuclear bulge of the milky way galaxy .",
    "the semi - analytical model outlined in sect.[sect : picture ] , and which is based on equation [ eq : df ] of @xcite , is based on simple characterizations of physical processes , which we calibrate using large - scale n - body simulations .",
    "the initial conditions for these simulations are selected to test key areas in the parameter space for producing imbhs in the inner @xmath8pc of the galactic center .",
    "the n - body calculations employ direct integration of newton s equations of motion , while accounting for complications such as dynamical friction and tidal effects due to the galactic field , stellar and binary evolution , physical stellar sizes and the possibility of collisions , and the presence of a supermassive black hole in the galactic center .",
    "two independent but conceptually similar programs are used : ( 1 ) the `` kira '' integrator , part of the starlab software environment ( see http://www.manybody.org/@xmath38manybody/starlab.html , @xcite ) , and ( 2 ) nbody4 + ( see http://www.sverre.org ) @xcite . both codes achieve their greatest speed , as in the simulations reported here , when run in conjunction with the special - purpose grape-6 ( see http://www.astrogrape.org ) hardware acceleration @xcite .",
    "both kira and nbody4 incorporate parametrized treatments of stellar evolution and allow for the possibility of direct physical collisions between stars , thus including the two key physical elements in the runaway scenario described here ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a collision occurs if the distance between two stars becomes smaller than the sum of the stellar radii , except that , for collisions involving black holes , we use the tidal radius instead . during a collision mass and momentum",
    "are conserved .",
    "these are reasonable assumptions since the relative velocity of any two colliding stars is typically much smaller than the escape speed from either stellar surface @xcite .",
    "we performed n - body simulations of star clusters containing up to 131,072 stars and starting at @xmath39pc , 2 , 4 , 10 and 100pc from the galactic center , with various initial concentrations ( @xmath40 and 9 ) and with lower limits to the initial mass function of 0.1 and 1 .",
    "these simulations were carried out as part of the calibration of the semi - analytic model which we presented in sect.[sect : analytic ] .",
    "one such comparison is presented in figure[fig : n - body ] , which shows the orbital evolution and runaway growth in a star cluster born with 65536 stars in a circular orbit at a distance of 2pc from the galactic center .",
    "the solid lines in the figure result from the semi - analytic model ( based on equation [ eq : df ] and @xcite ) , while the high precision n - body calculations are represented by dotted lines .",
    "they match quite well , indicating that the simple analytic model produces satisfactory results in reproducing the general features and physical scales of the evolution .    as the cluster in figure[fig : n - body ] sinks toward the galactic center , it produce one massive star through the collision runaway process . in figure[fig :",
    "image ] we show a snapshot of this simulations projected in three different planes at an age of 0.35myr . by this time @xmath41 of the cluster",
    "has already dispersed and its stars have spread out into the shape of a disk spanning the inward - spiraling orbit . by the time of figure [ fig : image ] , a @xmath42 collision runaway star has formed in the cluster center ; this object subsequently continues to grow by repeated stellar collisions .",
    "the growth of the collision runaway is indicated by the dotted line in figure[fig : n - body ] running from bottom left to top right ( scale on the right vertical axis ) .    by an age of about",
    "the cluster is almost completely disrupted and the runaway process terminates .",
    "after the cluster dissolves , the imbh continues to sink toward the galactic center , still accompanied by 10100 stars which initially were among the most massive in the cluster .",
    "near the end of its lifetime , the runaway star loses about 200 in a stellar wind and subsequently collapses to a @xmath43 imbh at about 2.4myr .",
    "the imbh and its remaining stellar companions continue to sink toward the galactic center . the continuing `` noise '' in the dotted curve in figure [ fig : n - body ] reflects the substantial eccentricity of the imbh orbit . at an age of 2.53myr",
    ", the remnant star cluster consisting of an imbh orbited by a few of the most massive stars , quite similar to the observed star cluster irs13 , arrives in the inner 0.1 pc of the galaxy ( see sect.[sect : observations ] ) .",
    "when the imbh arrives within about 0.1pc of the galactic center the standard formula for dynamical friction@xcite is becoming unreliable , as the background velocity dispersion increases and the effects of individual encounters become more significant .",
    "it is important , however , to ascertain whether the imbh spirals all the way into the smbh , or if it stalls in the last tenth of a parsec , as higher - mass black holes may tend to do @xcite .    to determine the time required for the imbh to reach the central smbh , we have performed additional n - body calculations , beginning with a 1000 and a 3000 imbh in circular orbits at a distance of 0.1pc from the galactic center .",
    "both imbhs are assumed to have shed their parent cluster by the start of the simulation .",
    "the inner parsec of the galaxy is modeled by 131,071 identical stars with a total stellar mass of @xmath44 , distributed according to a @xmath45 density profile ; a black hole of @xmath46 resides at the center .",
    "the region within a milliparsec of the central smbh is depleted of stars in our initial conditions .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the total galactic mass inside that radius , excluding the central smbh is probably less than @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we stop the calculations as soon as the imbh reaches this distance .",
    "figure[fig : final_parsec ] ( see also the dotted line in figs.[fig : n - body ] ) shows the orbital evolution of the 1000 and 3000 imbhs in our simulations .",
    "although the black - hole orbits are initially circular , eccentricities on the order of @xmath48 are induced quite quickly by close encounters with field stars .",
    "the rate of spiral - in near the smbh is smaller than farther out , because the increasing velocity dispersion tends to reduce the effect of dynamical friction and because the imbh reaches the inner depleted area .",
    "the central milliparsec was initially empty in our simulations , and there was insufficient time to replenish it during our calculations .",
    "it is unlikely that sufficient stellar mass exists within this region for dynamical friction to drive the imbh much closer to the smbh .",
    "( interestingly , this distance is comparable to the orbital semi - major axis of the star s0 - 2 , which is observed in a 15 year orbit around the galactic center @xcite . )",
    "the time scale for a 1 mpc orbit to decay by gravitational radiation exceeds the age of the galaxy for circular motion , so unless the imbh orbit is already significantly eccentric , or is later perturbed to higher eccentricity ( @xmath49 to reduce the merger time to @xmath50years ) by encounters with field stars or another imbh , the orbital decay effectively stops near the central smbh .",
    "while the imbh stalls , another star cluster may form , sink toward the galactic center , and give rise to a new imbh which subsequently arrives in the inner milliparsec ( see sec .",
    "5 ) . this process will be repeated for each new imbh formed , until interactions become frequent enough to drive a flux of imbhs into the loss cone where gravitational radiation can complete the merger process .",
    "we can estimate the number of imbhs in a steady state in the inner few milliparsecs of the smbh .",
    "the time scale for a close ( 90 degree deflection ) encounter in a system of @xmath51 imbhs is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the masses of the smbh and the imbh , respectively , and @xmath55 years is the typical orbital period at a distance of 1 mpc from the smbh . for @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", we find @xmath58 years , comparable to the in - fall time scale unless @xmath51 is large .",
    "close encounters are unlikely to eject imbhs from the vicinity of the galactic center , but they do drive the merger rate by replenishing the loss cone around the smbh @xcite . as",
    "imbhs accumulate , the cusp around the smbh eventually reaches a steady state in which the merger rate equals the rate of in - fall , with a roughly constant population of a few imbhs within about a milliparsec of the smbh .",
    "a comparable analysis was performed by @xcite for stellar mass black holes around the smbh , and if we scale their results to imbhs we arrive at a similar steady state population .",
    "we now turn to the overall evolution of the population of clusters which gave rise to the nuclear bulge .",
    "we have performed a monte - carlo study of the cluster population , adopting a star formation rate that declines as @xmath59 over the past 10 gyr @xcite .",
    "cluster formation times are selected randomly following this star formation history , and masses are assigned as described below , until the total mass equals the current mass of the nuclear bulge within 100 pc of the galactic center ",
    "about @xmath60 .",
    "the total number of clusters thus formed is @xmath61 over the 10 gyr period .",
    "for each cluster , we select a mass ( @xmath14 ) randomly from a cluster initial mass function which is assumed to follow the mass distribution observed in starburst galaxies  a power - law of the form @xmath62 between @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite . the distance to the galactic center ( @xmath25 )",
    "is again selected randomly , assuming that the radial distribution of clusters follows the current stellar density profile in the bulge between 1pc and 100pc@xcite .",
    "the current distribution of stars must reflect the formation distribution to a large extent , because most stars orbits do nt evolve significantly , but only the orbits of the more massive stellar clusters .",
    "the initial density profiles of the clusters are assumed to be @xmath409 king models .",
    "this choice of high - concentrated king models is supported by the recent theoretical understanding by @xcite of the relation between age and core - radius for young star clusters in the large magellanic cloud observed by @xcite .",
    "we establish a cluster mass - radius relation by further assuming that clusters are born precisely filling their jacobi surfaces in the galactic tidal field .",
    "this provides a lower limit to the fraction of clusters that produce an imbh and sink to the galactic center .",
    "the evolution of each cluster , including specifically the moment at which it undergoes core collapse , the mass of the collision runaway ( if any ) produced , and the distance from the galactic center at which the cluster dissolves , is then calculated deterministically using our semi - analytic model .",
    "after cluster disruption , the imbh continues to sink by dynamical friction , eventually reaching the galactic center .",
    "figure[fig : mc ] summarizes how the fates of the star clusters in our simulation depend on @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "open and filled circles represent initial conditions that result in an imbh reaching the central parsec by the present day .",
    "the various lines define the region of parameter space expected to contribute to the population of imbhs within the central parsec , as described in the caption . here",
    "we emphasize that our results depend linearly on the fraction of stars in the bulge that form in star clusters .",
    "the number of star clusters and imbhs is proportional to this factor , which is not necessarily constant with time .",
    "bear in mind also that , though theoretical uncertainties are about a factor of two , the systematic uncertainties can be much larger and depend critically on various assumptions in the models , like the amount of mass loss in the stellar wind of the collision product and the fate of the stellar remnant in the supernova explaion .",
    "the results of our calculations may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "5%  10% of star clusters born within 100pc of the galactic center produce an imbh .",
    "the mean mass of imbhs now found in the inner 10pc is @xmath43 , whereas imbhs between 90 and 100pc average @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   over the age of the galaxy ( @xmath66 years ) a total of 10003000 imbhs have reached the galactic center , carrying a total mass of @xmath67 . here",
    "the range in masses stems from variations in the adopted stellar mass function .",
    "4 .   at any instant ,",
    "approximately @xmath4 imbhs reside in the inner 10pc , about ten times that number lie within the nuclear star cluster ( inner 30pc ) , and several lie within the innermost few tenths of a parsec .",
    "one in every @xmath68 imbhs is still accompanied by a remnant of its young ( turn - off mass @xmath69 ) star cluster when it reaches the inner parsec , resulting in a few imbhs at any time in the inner few parsecs with young stars still bound to them , much like irs13e or irs16sw .",
    "on the basis of our n - body simulations of the central 0.1 pc in sect.[sect : finalparsec ] we expect that the majority of imbhs which arrive in the galactic center eventually merge with the smbh on a time scale of a few myr , driven by the emission of gravitational radiation and interactions with local field stars and other imbhs . in our simulations",
    "the in - fall rate has increased over the lifetime of the galaxy ( following our assumed star formation rate ) , from one arrival per @xmath70myr to the current value of one every @xmath71myr , with a time average imbh in - fall rate of roughly one per @xmath72myr .",
    "( a lower minimum mass in the initial mass function produces higher in - fall rates . )    some of the field stars near the smbh may be ejected from the galactic center with velocities of up to @xmath73km / s following encounters with the hard binary system formed by the imbh and the central smbh @xcite .",
    "support for this possibility comes from the recent discovery of ssdsj090745.0 + 024507 , a b9 star with a measured velocity of 709km / s directly away from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "imbhs are potentially important sources of gravitational wave radiation",
    ". a merger between a 1000 imbh and a @xmath74 smbh would be detectable by the lisa gravitational wave detector to a distance of several billion parsecs . assuming that the processes just described operate in most spiral galaxies , which have a density of roughly 0.002 mpc@xmath75 @xcite , we estimate a detectable imbh merger rate of around two per week , with a signal to noise @xmath76 .",
    "our semi - analytic model for the evolution of star clusters in the inner @xmath8pc of the galaxy yields a steady - state distribution of cluster masses which we can compare with observed star clusters in the vicinity of the galactic center .",
    "figure[fig : borissova ] compares the observed mass distribution of young star clusters in the bulge with our steady - state solution .",
    "the data include the arches cluster @xcite , the quintuplet @xcite , irs13e , irs16sw @xcite , and 7 recently discovered star clusters with reliable mass estimates . for comparison",
    "we show a realization of the present - day population of star cluster masses generated by our semi - analytic model .    using the adopted declining star - formation rate from sect.[sect : analytic ] ( see @xcite ) , we find about @xmath4 star clusters within the central 100 pc at any given time , consistent with the earlier prediction of @xcite . assuming a flat ( i.e.  uniform ) star formation rate , we predict @xmath77 clusters in the same region , about an order of magnitude more than currently observed . in our semi - analytic model , about 15% of all present - day star clusters host an imbh or are in the process of producing one .",
    "between 1% and 8% of star clusters with a present - day mass less than @xmath78 contain an imbh , whereas more than 80% of clusters with masses between 30,000 and @xmath79 host an imbh .",
    "for more massive clusters the probability of forming an imbh drops sharply .",
    "finally , we note that we are rather unlikely to find an orphaned very massive ( @xmath80 ) star . during the last 1 gyr , only about 1040 of such objects have formed in the inner 100pc of the galaxy .",
    "lower mass merger products , however , are quite common",
    ". the pistol star@xcite may be one observational example .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in our calculations is whether or not mass gain by stellar collisions exceeds mass loss by stellar winds .",
    "although the accretion rate in our models is very high , mass loss rates in massive stars are uncertain , and it is conceivable that sufficiently high mass loss rates might prevent the merger product from achieving a mass of more than a few hundred .    mass loss in massive ( @xmath81 ) stars may be radiatively driven by optically thin lines . in this case",
    "it is possible to derive upper limits to the mass loss .",
    "such calculations , including the von zeipel @xcite effect for stars close to the eddington - gamma limit , indicate that stellar wind mass loss rates may approach @xmath82yr@xmath83 .",
    "if the star is rotating near the critical rate , the mass loss rate may be even larger .",
    "outflow velocities , however , may be so small that part of the material falls back on the equatorial zone , where the mass loss is least .",
    "the calculations of match the observed mass loss rates for @xmath84 carina , which has a peak of @xmath85yr@xmath83 ( assuming spherical symmetry ) during normal outbursts , falling to @xmath86yr@xmath83 during the intervening 5.5years . for young ( @xmath87myr ) o stars in the small magellanic cloud low ( @xmath88/yr ) mass loss rates",
    "were observed , indicating that massive stars may have much lower mass loss rates until they approach the end of their main - sequence lifetimes ( see ) .",
    "thus it remains unclear whether the periods of high mass loss persist for long enough to seriously undermine the runaway scenario adopted here .",
    "we note that the collision runaways in our simulations are initiated by the arrival of a massive star in the cluster core .",
    "if such a star grows to exceed @xmath89 , most collisions occur within the first 1.5myr of the cluster evolution .",
    "the collision rate during the period of rapid growth typically exceeds one per @xmath90 years , sustained over about 1 myr , resulting in an average mass accretion rate exceeding @xmath82/yr , comparable to , and possibly exceeding , the maximum mass loss rates derived for massive stars .",
    "furthermore , in our n - body simulations ( and in the semi - analytic model ) , the stellar mass loss rate increases with time , with little mass loss at the zero - age main sequence and substantially more near the end of the main - sequence stellar lifetime ( @xmath91 ) . in other words , mass loss rates are relatively low while most of the accretion is occurring .",
    "this prescription for the mass loss rate matches that of evolutionary calculations for massive wolf - rayet stars .",
    "we also emphasize that a large mass loss rate in the merger product _ can not _ prevent the basic mass segregation and collision process , even though it might significantly reduce the final growth rate .",
    "these findings are consistent with recent n - body simulations of small clusters in which the assumed mass loss rate from massive ( @xmath92 ) stars exceeded @xmath82/yr @xcite .",
    "the stellar evolution of a runaway merger product has never been calculated in detail , and is poorly understood .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that its thermal time scale significantly exceeds the mean time between collisions .",
    "even if the star grows to @xmath93 , the thermal time scale will be 1@xmath94years , still comparable to the collision rate",
    ". the accreting object will therefore be unable to reestablish thermal equilibrium before the next collision occurs .",
    "we note in passing that the supermassive star produced in the runaway collision may be hard to identify by photometry if the cluster containing it can not be resolved : the runaway is mainly driven by collisions between massive stars , which themselves have luminosities close to the eddington - gamma limit . since the eddington luminosity scales linearly with mass , a collection of luminous blue variables at the eddington luminosity are comparable in brightness to an equally massive single star .",
    "spectroscopically , however , the collision runaway may be very different .",
    "mass loss in the form of a dense stellar wind before the supernova can dramatically reduce the mass of the final black hole , or could even prevent black hole formation altogether @xcite .",
    "the runaway merger in fig.[fig : n - body ] develops a strong stellar wind near the end of its lifetime before collapsing to a @xmath95 imbh at @xmath96myr .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the effect of stellar winds on the final imbh mass because the mass loss rate of such a massive star remains uncertain .",
    "however , it is important to underscore here the qualitative results that stellar winds are unable to prevent the occurrence of repeated collisions , and significantly limit the outcome only if the mass loss rate is very high  more than @xmath97and sustained over the lifetime of the star .",
    "the best imbh candidate in the milky - way galaxy was recently identified in the young association irs13e in the galactic center region .",
    "irs13e is a small cluster of stars containing three spectral type o5i to o5iii and four wolf - rayet stars , totaling at most @xmath98 .",
    "( the recently discovered cluster irs16sw@xcite also lies near the galactic center and reveals similarly interesting stellar properties . )",
    "both clusters are part of the population of helium - rich bright stars in the inner parsec of the galactic center . with a `` normal '' stellar mass function , as found elsewhere in the galaxy , stars as massive as those in irs13e are extremely rare , occurring only once in every @xmath73 stars . however , in the galactic center , a `` top - heavy '' mass function may be common @xcite .",
    "the mean proper motion of five stars in irs13e is @xmath99km / s;@xcite an independent measurement of four of these stars yields @xmath100km / s . if irs13e were part of the rotating central stellar disk @xcite , this would place the cluster @xmath101pc behind the plane on the sky containing the smbh , increasing its galactocentric distance to about 0.18pc , consistent with a circular orbit around the smbh at the observed velocity .",
    "the five irs16sw stars have @xmath102km / s @xcite , corresponding to the circular orbit speed at a somewhat larger distance ( @xmath103pc ) .",
    "the greatest distance between any two of the five stars in irs13e with known velocities is @xmath104seconds of arc ( 0.02pc at 8.5kpc ) , providing a lower limit on the jacobi radius : @xmath105pc .",
    "it then follows from the hills equation ( @xmath106 ) that the minimum mass required to keep the stars in irs13e bound is about 1300 ( see also ) .",
    "a more realistic estimate is obtained by using the measured velocities of the observed stars , using the expression : @xmath107 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of all stars , e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 , and e6 , is about @xmath10884km / s , which results in a estimated mass mass of about 1100016000 .",
    "such a high mass would be hard to explain with the collision runaway scenario .    however , the stars e1 and e6 may not be members . the extinction of the latter star is smaller than that of the other stars , indicating that it may be closer to the sun than the rest of the cluster and therefore not a member @xcite .",
    "one could also argue that star e1 should be excluded from the sample . with a high velocity in the opposite direction of the other stars it is equally curious as star e6 in both velocity space and the projected cluster image , where it is somewhat off from the main cluster position . without star e1",
    "the velocity dispersion of the cluster becomes @xmath109@xmath110km / s , which results in a estimated mass mass of about 51005800 .",
    "these estimates for the total cluster mass are upper limits for the estimated mass of the dark point mass in the cluster center . if the cluster potential is dominated by a point mass object with a total mass exceeding the stellar mass by a seizable fraction , the stars are in orbit around this mass point . in that case",
    "some of the stars may be near the pericenter of their orbit .",
    "since the velocity of a star at pericenter will be a factor of @xmath111 larger compared to the velocity in a circular orbit , the estimated black hole mass may therefore also be smaller by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "we stress that the imbh mass will be smaller than the total mass derived above since the cluster is made up out of the visible stars , unseen lower mass stars , possible stellar remnants and the potential imbh . with 300 ( seen ) but possibly up to @xmath43 of luminous material the mass for the imbh is then reduced to 2000  5000 .",
    "this is much more than the observed mass of the association , providing a lower limit on its dark mass component .      with a present density of @xmath112pc@xmath75 ,",
    "a collision runaway in irs13e is inevitable , regardless of the nature of the dark material in the cluster .",
    "therefore , even if the cluster currently does not contain an imbh , a collision runaway can not be prevented if the stars are bound .",
    "we have tested this using n - body simulations of small clusters of 256 and 1024 stars , with masses drawn from a salpeter mass function between 1 and 100 .",
    "these clusters , with @xmath409 king model initial density profiles , exactly filled their jacobi surfaces , and moved in circular orbits at 0.18pc from the galactic center .",
    "we continued the calculations until the clusters dissolved .",
    "these simulations lost mass linearly in time , with a half - mass lifetime of a few 10,000 years , irrespective of the initial density profile .",
    "this is consistent with the results of independent symplectic n - body simulations @xcite . in each of these simulations",
    "a minor runaway merger occurred among roughly a dozen stars , creating runaways of @xmath113 . in another set of larger simulations with 102416386 stars ,",
    "the runaway mergers were more extreme , with collision rates exceeding one per century !",
    "we draw two conclusions from these simulations .",
    "if the unseen material in irs13e consists of normal stars , then ( i ) the cluster can not survive for more than a few @xmath114 years , and ( ii ) runaway merging is overwhelmingly likely . if irs13e is bound , a cluster of normal stars can not be hidden within it , and the dark material must ultimately take the form of an imbh of about 20005000 ( see also ) .",
    "thus we argue that the properties of the dark - matter problem in irs13e could be solved by the presence of a single imbh of mass @xmath955000 , consistent earlier discussions .",
    "the seven observed stars may in that case be the remnant of a larger star cluster which has undergone runaway merging , forming the imbh during core collapse while sinking toward the galactic center @xcite . according to this scenario the stars we see are the survivors which have avoided collision and remained in tight orbits around the imbh .",
    "extensive position determinations with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) of sgr a * over an @xmath115 year baseline has revealed that the smbh in the galactic center ( assuming 4 million msun and a distance of 8.0kpc ) is about @xmath116kms@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "an imbh of 20005000 orbiting at a distance of @xmath117pc would create the linear velocity of about 0.150.39kms@xmath83 for sgr a * , since the orbital velocity of imbh is @xmath118km / s and its mass is @xmath119 of the central bh , assuming a circular orbit .",
    "if observations with the vlba continue with the same accuracy for the next decade , the imbh in irs13e can be detected by measuring the motion of sgr a*.      x - ray observations may offer a better chance of observing an individual imbh near the galactic center than the vlba radio observations discussed in the previous section . among the @xmath73 x - ray point sources within 23pc of the galactic center @xcite ,",
    "the source cxogc  j174540.0 - 290031 @xcite , with @xmath120 erg / s at a projected galactocentric distance of 0.11pc , is of particular interest .",
    "the peak radio intensity of this source is 0.1jansky at 1ghz @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath121 erg / s at the distance of the galactic center . using the recently proposed empirical relation between x - ray luminosity , radio flux , and the mass of the accreting black hole @xcite ,",
    "@xmath122 we derive a black hole mass of about 2000 .",
    "interestingly , this source has an 7.8 hour periodicity @xcite , which , if it reflects the orbital period , would indicate a semi - major axis of @xmath123 .",
    "the companion to the imbh would then have a roche radius of @xmath124 , consistent with a 1 main - sequence star .",
    "mass transfer in such a binary would be driven mainly by the emission of gravitational waves at a rate of @xmath125/myr @xcite , which is sufficient to power an x - ray transient with the observed x - ray luminosity and a duty cycle on the order of a few percent @xcite .",
