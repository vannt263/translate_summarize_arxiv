    "<S> we compute the standard model scalar coupling ( @xmath0 ) evolution in a particular qcd resummation scheme , where the qcd coupling becomes infrared finite due to the presence of a dynamically generated gluon mass , leading to the existence of a non - perturbative infrared fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how this scheme can be fixed taking recourse to phenomenological considerations in the infrared region . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd @xmath1 function associated to this non - perturbative coupling when introduced into the sm renormalization group equations increases the @xmath0 values at high energies .    other nonperturbative techniques , general properties of qcd    one of the techniques to study qcd at low energies are the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an analytic method but with the complication of dealing with an infinite tower of coupled integral equations . because of this , when using the sde , one have to make a truncation in the system of equations , which has to be done in a way that the symmetries of the theory are not broken , in particular </S>",
    "<S> , a rough truncation in the sde can cause a violation of the gauge symmetry . in the recent years </S>",
    "<S> an enormous progress has been made in solving sde in a gauge invariant way using the so called pinch technique @xcite , as a result it has been found the existence of a dynamical gluon mass in the propagator of the gluon field , as suggested many years ago by cornwall @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another non - perturbative technique is lattice qcd @xcite , which implies heavy numerical calculations requiring a considerably high amount of computer power . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained in qcd lattice simulations are in agreement with the sde in what concerns dynamical gluon mass generation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the infrared qcd coupling turns out to be infrared finite when gluons develop a dynamically generated mass . </S>",
    "<S> this point was already emphasized in ref.@xcite ; was also discussed at length in ref.@xcite , and leads to an infrared fixed point , which is a property of dynamical mass generation in non - abelian theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological consequences of such infrared finite coupling , or non - perturbative fixed point , have been discussed in ref.@xcite , and recently we have discussed how this non - perturbative fixed point can change the local minimum of a renormalization group improved effective potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this change of minimum state may produce noticeable modifications in the physical properties of the model studied in ref.@xcite .    in view of the results of ref.@xcite we will study the effect of the non - perturbative fixed point present in qcd with dynamically massive gluons in the scalar coupling evolution of the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed that we shall be dealing with a very particular qcd resummation scheme , provided by the results of the pinch technique applied to the sde , which have been argued that can lead to off - shell green s functions that are locally gauge invariant and renormalization group invariant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd @xmath2 coupling that we shall consider will not depend on the renormalization point @xmath3 but on the dynamical gluon mass @xmath4 and , of course , on the qcd characteristic scale @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling contains the effect of summation of several loops according to the calculations detailed in refs.@xcite , and the free parameter in this particular scheme , namely the infrared value of the dynamical gluon mass , will be fixed by taking recourse to phenomenological considerations about the coupling constant ir behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> the first calculation of the ir frozen qcd coupling in the presence of a dynamically generated gluon mass was obtained in ref.@xcite , leading to the following coupling : g^2(k^2)==4_s ( k^2 ) , [ eq:1 ] where @xmath6 with @xmath7 quark flavors and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the ir value of the dynamical gluon mass @xmath10 , which naturally goes to zero at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> note that the running charge has been obtained as a fit to the sde solutions in the pure gluon theory , but quarks are introduced at leading order just by its effect in the first @xmath1 function coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the most important factor in the @xmath11 frozen ir value of the qcd coupling determination is the ratio @xmath12 , which was approximately determined to be a factor of @xmath13 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible , and more detailed , fit of the effective qcd charge determined from the sde solutions within the pinch technique is given by @xcite _ s ( k^2)=^-1 , [ eq:2 ] where the function @xmath14 is given by f(k^2,m^2(k^2))=_1 m^2(k^2)+_2 , [ eq:3 ] where @xmath15 are fitting parameters and the function @xmath16 represents a running dynamical gluon mass that , apart from negligible logarithmic factors , is approximately given by @xcite m_g^2(k^2 ) , [ eq:4 ] where @xmath17 is the effective dynamical gluon mass ir value . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev , the best fit for the running charge gives @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> eqs.([eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) are just one fit for one specific @xmath9 and @xmath22 set of values , and it should be numerically calculated each time that we vary one of these parameters , while eq.([eq:1 ] ) can be used in the case of different @xmath9 values . as a crude approximation , without the need of calculating the full sde , we could just replace @xmath23 in eq.([eq:1 ] ) by @xmath24 given by eq.([eq:4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when we perform this replacement and compute the coupling for @xmath25 mev and @xmath19 mev we obtain a coupling that differs slightly from the coupling shown in eq.([eq:2 ] ) in the region of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> another approach can be obtained just assuming the following simple fit for the coupling constant 4_s ( k^2 ) & & ( 1 _ gev_^2 - k^2 ) + & & + ( k^2 -1 _ gev_^2 ) , [ eq:5 ] where @xmath27 is a constant that provides the interpolation between the constant behavior of the ir coupling with its high energy behavior , where the dynamical gluon mass falloff as @xmath28 @xcite . in any case </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the non - perturbative qcd coupling associated to the phenomenon of dynamical gluon mass generation matches exactly with the perturbative one at high energies .    </S>",
    "<S> exactly as performed in ref.@xcite , where the non - perturbative behavior of the coupling constant was used in the calculation of a renormalization group improved effective potential , we would like to use the coupling constant discussed above to compute the sm scalar coupling evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that such coupling appears in a non - perturbative qcd resummation scheme , and we shall need to take recourse of phenomenological considerations to fix its ir behavior before considering its use in the renormalization group ( rg ) equations . of course , as a requirement for stability of the calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the ir non - perturbative qcd coupling surely can not be large , or at least it must be smaller or of the order of the top quark yukawa coupling , since we are going to confront it with other sm couplings . </S>",
    "<S> however this is exactly what is going to happen , and most of the phenomenological models trying to extract the @xmath2 ir coupling value seems to indicate a small number . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the description of jet shapes observables require @xmath11 to be of the order @xmath29 @xcite , the famous models of quarkonium potential calculations of ref.@xcite use an ir coupling of order @xmath30 , the ratio @xmath31 computed by mattingly and stevenson @xcite can fit the data with @xmath32 , analysis of @xmath33 annihilation , as well as bottomonium and charmonium fine structure in the framework of the background perturbation theory may lead to a frozen value of the coupling constant as low as @xmath34 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent analysis of experimental data on the unpolarized structure function of the proton indicates that @xcite : 0.13 0.18 , [ eq:6 ] what is also consistent with @xmath2 values extracted from the gdm sum rule @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> other phenomenological calculations considering a finite ir qcd coupling can be found in ref.@xcite , and a compilation of some results can be seen in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can add to these phenomenological computations the theoretical @xmath11 value obtained through the functional schrdinger equation which is equal to @xmath35 @xcite , and the quite extensive list of an ir finite effective coupling calculations based on the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) within the pinch technique @xcite , which also lead to a successful strong interaction phenomenology @xcite .    in the scheme that we are following the qcd coupling freezes in the ir at one reasonably small value , and , as shown in eq.([eq:1 ] ) and eq.([eq:2 ] ) , the ir value is directly related to the ir value of the dynamical gluon mass , which is approximately bounded to @xmath36 in order to ensure that there be no tachyons in the gluon propagator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the preferred phenomenological value of this mass is associated to the ratio @xmath37 @xcite . for a dynamical gluon mass @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an ir qcd coupling of order of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , according to the many phenomenological determinations of the @xmath11 values described previously , and with the phenomenological determinations of the effective dynamical gluon mass @xcite we will consider the following range for the ir value of this coupling 0.4 0.8 , [ eq:7 ] what is in agreement with previous discussions about the ir value of the strong coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that , according to eq.([eq:1 ] ) , the possible values of the ratio @xmath12 for two quark flavors , to be in agreement with eq.([eq:7 ] ) , are in the range : 1.2 2.86 . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:8 ] which are also in agreement with the many different determinations of @xmath40 and @xmath9 that can be found in the literature . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we have set up the parameters necessary in this qcd resummation scheme to calculate the sm scalar self coupling evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the scalar self coupling @xmath0 appearing in the sm , where the scalar field may acquire a vacuum expectation value @xmath41 gev , are giving by the standard rg equations where each sm ordinary coupling @xmath42 is governed by the respective @xmath1 function _ </S>",
    "<S> i ( _ i ) = ^2 _ i ( ) , [ eq:9 ] where @xmath42 represents @xmath0 and any gauge or yukawa sm couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the sm stability up to the planck scale requires @xmath43 , and the evolution of this coupling is determined solving the coupled system of differential equations given by eq.([eq:9 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the sm rg equations with the one loop @xmath1 functions in the ( @xmath44 ) scheme ( up to eq.(13 ) ) are given by _ & & = , + _ y_t & & = , + _ g_1 & & = g_1 ^ 3 , + _ g_2 & & = g_2 ^ 3 , + _ g_3 & & = -_0 g^3 ( 1- ) , [ eq : x ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46}$ ] , and @xmath47 is the first coefficient of the qcd @xmath1 function . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are respectively the scalar , yukawa top quark , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath1 functions . </S>",
    "<S> however @xmath56 has been changed by the non - perturbative qcd @xmath1 function generated by the non - perturbative coupling described previously . </S>",
    "<S> this is the approach pursued in ref.@xcite , and also in ref.@xcite in a context that includes gravity in the calculation .    to solve the rg equations we will use the same one - loop ( and three - loop ) sm @xmath1 functions used in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . in this case </S>",
    "<S> our results are shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) indicated by @xmath57 and @xmath58-loops ( respectively small and large dashed curve and the continuous one ) , which agree with the ones of ref.@xcite and allow us to check the numerical code . </S>",
    "<S> we have used exactly the same initial conditions shown in table 1 of ref.@xcite at @xmath59 , where the top mass is @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 gev , and _ s ( m_z)=0.11850.0007 . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:77 ] for the @xmath0 evolution at very high energies we assumed @xmath62 , and no particular attention has been done to the low energy evolution and the various quark thresholds below the top quark scale , what was also not considered in @xcite .    ) </S>",
    "<S> evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57 and @xmath58-loops standard pertubative calculations are shown by the dashed and continuous lines . the shaded area is obtained varying the @xmath12 values between @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( corresponding to @xmath11 between @xmath39 and @xmath65 ) . the curve in the middle of the shaded area correspond to the @xmath0 evolution for the phenomenologically preferred ratio of @xmath66 , and this curve do not cross the line @xmath67 up to the planck scale . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now use the same numerical code to compute the scalar coupling evolution just changing the standard perturbative qcd @xmath1 function by the non - perturbative one described in eq.([eq : x ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one very important point is to recall that our equations are in agreement with the boundary conditions given by the experimental @xmath68 and @xmath69 masses and the one of eq.([eq:77 ] ) . in the ir region , in the limit of two light quarks , the non - perturbative qcd @xmath1 function and the coupling generated by it is consistent with eq.([eq:7 ] ) , which can be considered the condition that fix our scheme , and in the ultraviolet region , with six active quarks , the effect of the running dynamical gluon mass is quite small and its contribution is one order of magnitude below the uncertainty in the coupling determination at the @xmath70 pole giving in eq.([eq:77 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally the range of ir coupling values giving by eq.([eq:7 ] ) is the one that constrains our @xmath12 values , resulting in the shaded area shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) for the scalar coupling evolution . for most of the phenomenologically </S>",
    "<S> expected values of the dynamical gluon mass the sm scalar coupling evolution does not cross the line @xmath71 up to the planck mass .    we have computed the sm scalar coupling evolution with a very particular qcd resummation scheme , and , in this scheme , the scalar coupling evolution is positive up to the planck mass for a certain range of the parameter that determine the scheme , which is the dynamically generated gluon mass . </S>",
    "<S> the approach used here was considered previously in ref.@xcite , and a similar result , but assuming a fixed point behavior generated by gravitational interaction , was obtained in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are many points still to be discussed in this type of approach , which are related to the introduction of the non - perturbative conformal behavior into the rg equations . </S>",
    "<S> one have also to recall that the non - perturbative coupling considered here corresponds to an all order coupling in one specific sum of graphics , and to one scheme where the qcd @xmath72 scale is fixed but the dynamical gluon mass may vary with @xmath7 ( increasing its value @xcite ) , leading to even larger @xmath0 values at high energies , on the other hand this variation of @xmath9 with @xmath7 may also be erased by the introduction of massive physical quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility has not been considered due to the lack of precise simulations of the @xmath9 variation with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared finite qcd coupling due to the existence of a dynamical gluon mass seems to be a reality at this point , and the qcd scheme introduced here may change some results found in the literature @xcite , but improvements in the sde solutions with better approximations and the introduction of physical quarks can still modify the results that we described in this work . </S>"
