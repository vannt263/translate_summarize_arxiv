    "calculations of high energy hard scattering processes in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) rely on two basic ingredients  ( 1 ) the perturbatively calculated scattering cross - sections involving the fundamental partons , leptons , and gauge bosons and ( 2 ) the parton distributions inside the incoming hadrons .",
    "our knowledge of these universal parton distributions functions ( pdf s ) is derived , in turn , from the analysis of data for a variety of hard scattering processes .",
    "early analyses were often limited to deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering and lepton pair production , as these were the processes for which extensive data sets were available and for which next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations of the hard scattering subprocesses had been performed .",
    "now the number of available nlo calculations has increased and , simultaneously , data for additional hard scattering processes have become available for a variety of beams and targets .",
    "this progress makes it possible to determine the parton distributions with a greater precision than was previously possible .",
    "indeed , assumptions such as an su(3 ) or su(2 ) symmetry for the quark - antiquark sea in the proton have had to be discarded in the face of experimental evidence to the contrary",
    ".    with this wealth of data and corresponding theoretical calculations , true `` global analyses '' have become possible .",
    "in such a program there are two main goals .",
    "the first is to determine the parton distributions as precisely as possible , using all available experimental input , and to suggest which new types of data are necessary in order to further improve the precision .",
    "a review of progress in this area and references to earlier work can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "secondly , with an over - constrained set of pdf s it becomes possible to explore whether or not the parton - level calculations in pqcd constitute a consistent theoretical framework to account for all the available experimental data relevant for pqcd studies .",
    "this may point to areas where improved theoretical treatments are required and , perhaps , uncover areas where various data sets used in the analysis might be mutually inconsistent .",
    "either way , one can expect important progress to be made as the result of careful and critical confrontation of data with theory .",
    "this potential has been discussed in some length in ref.@xcite .",
    "this paper describes the series of global analyses conducted by the cteq collaboration .",
    "the necessary tools for carrying out this systematic global analysis program have been developed from those used in the previous work of duke , owens , and collaborators @xcite , @xcite and morfin - tung @xcite .",
    "the use of two independent qcd parton evolution and global fitting programs provides a valuable consistency check on all aspects of the analysis .",
    "the cteq program is designed to systematically refine the pdf s as new theoretical and experimental advances are made , and to clearly describe the theoretical and experimental inputs and their relation to the resulting parton distributions .",
    "the different versions of cteq distributions reflect historically a series of different assumptions and inputs . as a general rule ,",
    "newer versions incorporate more up - to - date data and are preferred _ overall _ than earlier ones , although this may not be an absolute statement because the multi - faceted nature of global analysis does not always lead to a one - dimensional progression of improvements  as will become clear when these developments are described .",
    "it should be recognized that , in general , differences between current and prior pdf s are not a reflection of `` theoretical uncertainties '' , but rather are indications of the manner in which new developments in data / theory impact on the determination the underlying parton distributions .    the first stage of this analysis ( known as `` cteq1''@xcite ) , was performed in 1992 following the availability of the high precision deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data by the ccfr @xcite and nmc @xcite collaborations .",
    "a second , unpublished set ( known as `` cteq2 '' ) , spurred by new data from hera @xcite , has been circulated during the past year .",
    "the advent of recent data on the lepton asymmetry in @xmath6boson production @xcite and on the difference in drell - yan cross - sections from proton and neutron targets @xcite has stimulated further refinements which result in a new set which will be referred to as `` cteq3 . '' the common features as well as differences amongst these three sets will be discussed in detail in this paper .    in secs .",
    "[ sec : expt ] and [ sec : analysis ] below , we review the various physical processes and experimental inputs included in our analysis and present a relatively self - contained account of the analysis and fitting procedures used .",
    "the development of the three versions of cteq distributions is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdfs ] , reserving the most detailed discussion to the latest version .",
    "comparisons with other parton distributions and with recent data are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] .",
    "some remaining uncertainties in the parton distributions and outstanding challenges are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "readers with immediate interest in results and recent developments can skip to sec .",
    "[ sec : pdfs ] and refer back for necessary details .",
    "a similar program of global analyses and continual upgrading of pdf s has been undertaken by the mrs group @xcite .",
    "the recently released mrs(h ) distributions have now been revised and replaced by the mrs(a ) set as a result of new data mentioned above .",
    "a comparison of these results with those of our analysis is included in sec.[sec : compare ] .",
    "in order to make the comparison of theory with experiment well - defined , we have limited the kinematic range to that where the `` leading twist '' qcd contributions are dominant .",
    "thus , we restrict the selection of experimental data to kinematic regions which contain at least one large momentum scale `` @xmath7 '' @xmath8 . in the absence of a reliable theoretical guide in the perturbative formalism , the value @xmath9 is varied within the range @xmath10 gev to test for sensitivity of the results to this choice .",
    "we found stable results generally with the following minimum kinematic constraints : for deep inelastic scattering , @xmath7 ( virtuality of the vector boson ) @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 ( cm energy ) @xmath13 gev ; for lepton - pair production , @xmath14 gev ; for direct photon production @xmath15 gev .",
    "recent high statistics dis data from nmc @xcite on @xmath16 and @xmath17 using a muon beam and from ccfr @xcite on @xmath18 using ( anti- ) neutrinos , combined with the existing bcdms @xcite results provide excellent coverage of the kinematic region @xmath19 .",
    "new measurements of @xmath20 from hera @xcite have extended the kinematic range down to very small @xmath21 values , approaching @xmath22 .",
    "although the errors are comparatively large , the extended range provides useful constraints on the behavior of the parton distributions in the small-@xmath21 region .",
    "( throughout this paper , `` small-@xmath21 '' means @xmath23 . ) as will be discussed in some detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdfs ] , this is particularly important in light of questions raised concerning the consistency of the structure functions measured in the other experiments in the intermediate region @xmath24 @xcite .    precision data from the slac - mit series of experiments @xcite largely lie outside the kinematic cuts ( especially when the cuts are raised above the minimum quoted above ) ; and those data points within the cuts agree well with the bcdms and nmc data already included .",
    "they are thus not used in the analyses reported here .",
    "data from the earlier emc experiment @xcite are excluded since the disagreement between these data with other data sets appears to be understood now as the result of the new nmc analysis .",
    "data from the cdhsw neutrino experiment @xcite are also not used since in the ( wide ) region where they agree with the ccfr results , the latter completely dominate due to the much smaller errors ; and in the ( narrow ) region where they disagree , it would be inconsistent to include both sets .    to apply the selected experimental results to the study of the parton structure of the nucleon ,",
    "the heavy target neutrino data must be converted to their nucleon equivalent .",
    "this conversion is done using measured light to heavy target ratios obtained in electron and muon scattering processes by the slac - mit @xcite , emc @xcite , and nmc @xcite experiments .",
    "there is an uncertainty associated with this procedure , which will be commented on later .",
    "dis data by themselves are not sufficient to provide a complete set of constraints on the parton content of the nucleon , since the measured nucleon structure functions represent only a few independent combinations of the parton flavors .",
    "lepton - pair production experiments provide a useful handle on the anti - quark distributions ( through the @xmath25 annihilation mechanism ) and the gluon distribution ( through the @xmath26 `` compton scattering '' mechanism ) . from fixed - target experiments we use the full data set on the double - differential cross - section @xmath27 measured by the high statistics e605 experiment at fermilab @xcite .",
    "we also include the new collider data on lepton - pairs measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "although the errors on these data are comparatively large , they do provide some constraints in the @xmath21 @xmath28 region which is beyond the reach of fixed - target experiments .",
    "another independent source of information is direct photon production which is particularly sensitive to the gluon distribution .",
    "in addition to the commonly used wa70 data @xcite , we also include results from the ua6 @xcite and e706 @xcite experiments .",
    "together these provide coverage of the region @xmath29 and , hence , help to constrain the gluon distribution in the middle range of @xmath21 .",
    "the deep inelastic data provide some constraint on the gluon for smaller values of @xmath21 through the slope of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "additional information at small values of @xmath21 is provided by direct photon data from various collider experiments .",
    "indeed , the coverage in @xmath21 extends now down to about 0.02 making a simultaneous analysis of all of the available direct photon data a potentially powerful tool for extracting the gluon distribution .",
    "however , there are still unresolved theoretical problems associated with understanding the full range of inclusive ( mostly fixed target ) and isolated ( mostly collider ) direct photon data which need further study",
    ". such a project has been initiated by members of the cteq collaboration and the results will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of the present work only the fixed target results on inclusive photon cross - section cited above have been used .",
    "two new types of data have become available in the past year and they have provided valuable information on pdf s , notably flavor differentiation of partons , which were not fully covered by earlier data sets . in particular , na51 @xcite measured the difference of cross sections for producing lepton pairs at @xmath32 from proton and neutron targets . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this is particularly sensitive to the difference of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 distributions . and",
    "the cdf collaboration has presented new data on the charge asymmetry of the decay leptons in @xmath12 production @xcite .",
    "this measurement contributes to the differentiation of the valence @xmath35 and @xmath36 quarks as well as the sea - quarks .",
    "the effects of including these two data sets will be discussed further in the next section .",
    "the full data sets we use are summarized in table [ tbl : dataset ] .",
    "our goals in the global analysis program are two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we are seeking a universal set of parton distributions which provide an accurate description of all of the data sets and are therefore suitable for use in the calculation of other high energy processes . on the other",
    ", we wish to determine to what degree the theoretical treatment of the hard scattering processes in the pqcd framework is consistent with all the available experimental results .    to this end , except where otherwise noted , all data sets included in the analysis are treated on the same footing .",
    "this is to be contrasted with an often adopted procedure of emphasizing dis data as the primary source of information ( hence , performing a least-@xmath37 fit to these data alone ) , using the other processes only as supplementary constraints .",
    "the simultaneous fitting of many different types of data necessitates the inclusion of both systematic as well as statistical errors .",
    "the systematic errors include both overall and point - to - point errors .",
    "the treatment of the latter poses a particularly difficult problem .",
    "the proper treatment of such errors typically differs from one experiment to another and doing this for all experiments requires a prohibitive amount of computer resources .",
    "we studied the impact on the global fit of a full - scale treatment of the ( correlated ) systematic errors from the high statistics ccfr and bcdms experiments compared to the common practice of combining the point - to - point systematic and statistical errors in quadrature .",
    "the difference is not significant .",
    "thus , we use the latter procedure as an adequate compromise out of practical necessity .",
    "( clearly , a fine - tuning of the final results , including a full treatment of the errors for selected data sets , is possible if necessary . )    the treatment of the overall normalization errors utilized in cteq analyses differs from that employed by other groups ( including most early pdf s , see @xcite , and @xcite ) which usually allow all experimental data sets to be varied freely . in our analysis , with the exception of data which pertain to measured ratios , the normalization ( fitting ) parameter @xmath38 for each data set @xmath39 is associated with a fully correlated error @xmath40 given by the experiment : a term of the form @xmath41 is then added to the overall @xmath37 in the fitting process .",
    "this procedure properly takes into account the normalization uncertainties of the experiments , whereas the usual practice mentioned above technically corresponds to assuming infinite normalization errors for all experiments .",
    "the hard cross - sections of all processes included in the analysis are calculated in pqcd to nlo in @xmath42 .",
    "we use the scheme with 5 flavors as the standard , cf .",
    "[ subs : parametrization ] for more details . while such calculations are generally less sensitive than leading - order ( lo ) results to the choice of the renormalization and factorization scales ( denoted jointly by the symbol @xmath43 ) , the residual dependence on these choices provides a potentially important source of theoretical uncertainty . in principle , this uncertainty is one order higher than the approximation used , _",
    "i.e. _ , next - to - next - to - leading order in our case . in practice",
    ", it has been learned that the size of the uncertainty is process - dependent .",
    "it is relatively small for dis and for lepton - pair production and one usually chooses @xmath44 , the virtuality of the exchanged virtual vector boson , since this is the natural large scale in the problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the nlo predictions for direct photon production are still sensitive to the choice of @xmath45 it is important to address this issue if quantitative results on the gluon distribution are to be extracted . the common practice of making a specific choice ( say @xmath46 without discussion implicitly introduces a bias into the analysis because of the non - negligible @xmath43-dependence . in this analysis",
    ", we have made the first attempt to address this issue by assigning a `` theoretical error '' to the predictions associated with the choice of @xmath43 .",
    "the size of this error is estimated by computing the range of predictions spanned by @xmath47 to @xmath48 . during the process of fitting",
    ", we let the scale parameter @xmath49 for direct photon calculation float and add a contribution to the overall @xmath50 due to scale uncertainty given by the deviation of @xmath49 from @xmath51 divided by the `` error '' defined above .",
    "although the details of this procedure ( such as the central value for @xmath49 and the exact range used to estimate the error ) may be the subject of some debate , it nevertheless represents a reasonable treatment of the theoretical uncertainty which otherwise is simply ignored .",
    "the relationship between pdf s and the experimental input is in general quite involved since all parton flavors contribute to the nlo formulas for the hard cross - section ; and , in addition , the parton distribution functions always mix as the result of qcd evolution .",
    "nonetheless , simple leading order parton model formulas neglecting small sea - quark contributions are often useful in providing a qualitative guide to analysis strategies .",
    "we will review the most relevant relations , with the understanding that they are modified by nlo corrections in practice ( to varying degrees for different processes ) .",
    "consider , first , deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the available high statistics data come in four different types , the expressions for which are , in lowest order , given as follows .",

    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , or , equivalently , @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , these four combinations are sufficient for examining the question of the breaking of su(3 ) flavor symmetry of the quark - antiquark sea . utilizing the equations given above",
    ", the strange sea may be expressed as @xmath58 since the right - hand - side appears as a small difference between two much larger numbers , the relative uncertainty becomes large and , furthermore , is sensitive to the overall systematic errors of the experiments  even though , in recent high precision experiments , the latter have been reduced to a level sufficient for the application of this relation . a more direct measure of the strange quark sea is provided by the @xmath59 production of charm .",
    "unfortunately , data on this process have not yet been made available in a form independent of experimental corrections .",
    "this issue will be discussed in section [ subs : cteq1 ] .",
    "the question of su(2 ) breaking in the sea is not directly addressed by the types of data listed above .",
    "some information is provided by the gottfried integral which takes the form @xmath60\\frac{dx}x.\\ ] ]    the nmc collaboration has measured @xcite @xmath61 . in lowest order",
    "one has @xmath62 the experimental result cited above indicates that @xmath63 when integrated over @xmath21 .",
    "however , information on the @xmath21 dependence of this su(2 ) breaking must be found from another source .",
    "lepton - pair production ( lpp , or the drell - yan process ) provides direct information on the anti - quark distributions as well as the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 quarks .",
    "for simplicity , consider the cross - section @xmath64 for lpp in proton collisions on an isoscalar target .",
    "in lowest order , retaining only the light quark and antiquark contributions , this cross section is proportional to the following product of parton distributions : @xmath65 where each of the distributions is evaluated at @xmath66 .",
    "note that all terms on the right - hand side are directly proportional to anti - quark distributions ( in contrast to dis where @xmath67 usually is submerged under @xmath68 for a large part of the x - range ) .",
    "eq.([sigma1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath69+\\frac 32(\\overline{u}-\\overline{d})[(u+d)-(\\overline{u}+\\overline{d } ) ] .",
    "\\label{sigma2}\\ ] ] in principle , all of the terms except @xmath70 are constrained by the deep inelastic data .",
    "therefore , the lepton pair data provide a direct measure of the su(2 ) breaking of the sea , @xmath71 , when used in conjunction with the deep inelastic data .",
    "in fact , the e-605 data on @xmath72 used in this analysis cover a range in @xmath73 ( centered about zero ) .",
    "this provides even more information than the @xmath32 case shown above  since the y - dependence extends the @xmath21 range through the relation @xmath74  but the principle is the same .",
    "all the cteq analyses result in substantial su(2 ) breaking due to the use of the full range of dis and lpp data . since the e-605 data constrain the pdf s over a range in @xmath21 covering approximately 0.10 - 0.6 ( when the @xmath73-range is taken into account ) , the su(2 ) breaking effects observed are reliable only over this range . to extend these results to lower values of @xmath75 additional experimental measurements will be needed .",
    "recently , the na51 experiment@xcite measured the asymmetry between the cross section for producing lepton pairs from proton and neutron targets , designed to probe directly the quantity @xmath70 . as shown in @xcite , this quantity",
    "can be written as @xmath76 where the subscript @xmath77 denotes a valence distribution .",
    "the na51 result is @xmath78 at @xmath32 and @xmath79 , where the statistical and systematic errors have been added in quadrature .",
    "comparison with eq.([ady ] ) shows that since @xmath80 , one must have @xmath81 .",
    "this is consistent with the sign of the breaking indicated by the gottfried sum result .    also of interest is the lepton charge asymmetry recently observed in @xmath12 production by the cdf collaboration .",
    "consider the charge asymmetry of @xmath12 production ( before decaying into leptons ) , defined as @xmath82 where the superscript denotes the charge of the @xmath12 . for @xmath83 collisions in leading order parton model , @xmath84 is given approximately by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "letting @xmath88 , one can write @xmath89 as noted in ref.@xcite , in the region of small @xmath73 ( where @xmath90 ) this asymmetry is directly proportional to the _ slope of the ratio _ @xmath91 in @xmath21 : @xmath92 for the cdf experiment , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , thereby providing information on the ratio of the @xmath36 and @xmath35 distributions in the region of @xmath95 of ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "actual data on this process are for the corresponding decaying lepton asymmetry , so the above discussion is relevant only on the qualitative level since eqs.([wasym2]-[wasym4 ] ) are considerably smeared when applied to the measured leptons .    as mentioned earlier , in addition to these simple parton model relations",
    ", some observables can be sensitive to parton distributions through nlo effects .",
    "two examples come readily to mind : the precise data on dis place important constraints on the gluon distribution @xmath97 in the region @xmath98 ( not covered by current fixed - target direct - photon data ) through the @xmath7-dependence of the structure functions ; and lpp data provide additional constraints on @xmath97 through the `` compton - scattering '' mechanism .",
    "these examples caution us against taking simple parton relations too literally under all circumstances .",
    "we now address the issue of the parametrization of the initial pdf s at some @xmath99 which serves as the non - perturbative input to the global analysis .",
    "the forms chosen must be flexible enough to account for all experimental input , if possible , yet they should not be under - constrained . considering the current status of the experimental evidence as discussed above , the parametrization must allow for breaking of both su(3 ) and su(2 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "our input parton distributions are parametrized at @xmath100 ( which coincides which the charm threshold we use , see below ) .",
    "the @xmath7-dependence of the parton distributions is generated by qcd - evolution using two - loop expressions for the splitting functions and running coupling .",
    "in general , the factorization scheme is used although , in response to the need for dis - scheme and leading - order ( lo ) calculations , we also generate equivalent parton distributions in these schemes .",
    "the heavy quark thresholds are taken as 1.6 and 5.0 gev for the @xmath101 and @xmath102 quarks , respectively , and the heavy quark distributions are generated using massless evolution starting from a boundary condition of a vanishing pdf at the appropriate threshold equal to the corresponding quark mass .",
    "the renormalization scheme on which this definition of heavy quark parton distribution functions is based has been formulated precisely in refs.@xcite . in principle , it is possible to have non - zero heavy - quark distributions at threshold  _",
    "e.g. _ to have some `` intrinsic charm '' , as has been suggested occasionally in the literature .",
    "we do not include this possibility for lack of positive experimental evidence at this time .",
    "the functional forms used for the initial parton distributions in the three rounds of cteq analyses vary slightly .",
    "we give here the explicit expressions used in the most current cteq3 analysis : @xmath103 the coefficients @xmath104 and @xmath105 are fixed by the number sum rules for the valence quarks , @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be expressed as combinations of euler beta functions , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath106 $ ] . ] and the gluon normalization coefficient @xmath107 is fixed by momentum conservation . furthermore , with the data currently available it is not possible to separately determine the low-@xmath21 behavior for the sea and gluon distributions , so we have chosen @xmath108 and set the strange quark distribution to be proportional to the average non - strange sea .",
    "we have also fixed @xmath109 in most of our fits since the resulting @xmath110 agrees well with the recently published nlo strange quark distribution measured in the most accurate dimuon neutrino experiment @xcite .",
    "( deviations from these choices used in earlier cteq1 and cteq2 analyses will be noted in the next section . )",
    "further reduction of independent parameters could be achieved by assumptions such as @xmath111 ( motivated by regge exchange considerations ) .",
    "the viability of such assumptions needs to be tested during the process of the global analysis .    in practice ,",
    "the series of cteq analyses adopted the procedure of starting with a sufficient number of parameters to establish a good fit , then systematically reducing that number to eliminate extraneous degrees of freedom while maintaining good agreement with data . in the most recent cteq analyses we found it possible to obtain excellent overall fit using only 15 independently adjustable _ shape parameters _ to describe the input distributions ( see sec .",
    "[ subs : cteq3 ] and table [ tbl : param ] for details ) .",
    "in addition , there are individual normalization parameters for each experiment ( constrained by appropriate experimental errors , as described earlier ) , the value of @xmath112 , and the value of the parameter associated with the theoretical scale uncertainty in direct photon calculations discussed in sec.[subs : fitting ] .    applying",
    "the pdf s obtained here to generate predictions for processes at new facilities in regions of @xmath21 and @xmath31 beyond those covered in the current global analyses necessarily entails extrapolations in these variables . if one is interested in a region of @xmath21 below that which was fitted , but at a higher value of @xmath31 , the `` feed down '' property of the evolution equations ( due to the parton splitting process ) provides reasonably reliable extrapolations ( cf .",
    "@xcite )  provided the input distribution functions in this @xmath21 region are relatively smooth ( hence the result is dominated by the nature of the splitting kernel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested in small @xmath21 and moderate @xmath31 , where the pdf s are still dominated by the input functions , the results are in fact only extrapolations , not constrained either by theory or experiment .",
    "it is thus important to chose functional forms that smoothly extrapolate into such regions while simultaneously acknowledging the inherent risk of such extrapolations .",
    "sometimes , a given functional form can lead to unintended behavior of the parton distributions beyond the region where data exist .",
    "these considerations must be kept in mind , as the parametrization of the non - perturbative initial parton distributions , although guided by certain qualitative `` theoretical considerations''(many of which have had to be abandoned in recent years in the face of new experimental results ) , is ultimately dictated by data and by experience gained in previous global analyses .",
    "the choices shown above are certainly not unique and do , in fact , differ slightly from those used in other work , both by us and by other groups @xcite .",
    "it is possible to generate fits of comparable quality ( in the sense of least-@xmath37 ) using somewhat different functional forms as long as both forms can parametrize the requisite parton distribution shapes to account for current data . in that case ,",
    "any remaining difference in the parton distributions can only be resolved by future experiments .",
    "three rounds of global analysis based on the general procedures described above have been completed by the cteq collaboration .",
    "a short report on the cteq1 analysis has already been published @xcite . aside from obtaining several up - to - date sets of parton distributions ( the `` cteq1 distributions '' ) , this analysis uncovered an unexpected inconsistency among existing experiments concerning the flavor dependence of the sea quark distributions .",
    "we briefly discuss the relevant points and subsequent developments on this issue in the next subsection .",
    "the advent of new data from hera along with an alternative treatment of the strange sea led to the development of the cteq2 distributions which were made available in the fall of 1993 .",
    "these distributions are described in sec .",
    "[ subs : cteq2 ] .",
    "recent lepton pair asymmetry data from na51 and w - decay lepton asymmetry data from cdf prompted refinements of the analysis , resulting in a new set of cteq3 distributions which we discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ subs : cteq3 ] .",
    "comparisons with other distributions are presented in sec.[sec : compare ] .",
    "the cteq1 analysis @xcite was based on data on cross - sections and structure functions available at the end of 1992 .",
    "the list of data sets used is given in table  [ tbl : dataset ] with `` 1 '' marked in the final column .",
    "very good fits to this wide range of data were obtained  both the overall @xmath37 and the @xmath37 distribution among the experimental data sets indicate a remarkable degree of consistency and are in much better quantitative agreement with the available data than previous global fits .",
    "five sets of parton distributions representing two best fits in the @xmath113  and dis scheme ( cteq1 m and cteq1d ) , one fit with a `` singular '' gluon distribution ( cteq1ms ) , one with @xmath112 fixed at a higher ( `` lep '' ) value ( cteq1ml ) , and one suitable for leading order calculations ( cteq1l ) were obtained .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "one disturbing feature of the cteq1 parton distributions was that the strange quark distribution @xmath114 obtained was considerably larger in the @xmath115 region then those obtained from leading - order parton model analysis of the neutrino dimuon production data @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that this @xmath114 behavior follows necessarily from the high precision input data sets on total inclusive structure functions measured by the ccfr and nmc collaborations through the familiar ( `` charge ratio '' ) parton model identity @xmath116_small corrections _ , cf .",

    "although this combination of structure functions entails using the ( small ) difference between two larger numbers , the quoted experimental statistical and systematic errors of the relevant high precision dis experiments are even smaller , hence enabling this relation ( which is implicitly embedded in the global analysis calculations ) to play a decisive role in the determination of @xmath114 .",
    "the apparent disagreement with the dimuon results on @xmath114 imply either the theoretical input ( to the global analysis or to the dimuon analysis ) has deficiencies , or some experimental data sets are inconsistent with each other within the quoted errors . although our global analysis , by itself , can not resolve this dilemma , it was the insistence on taking available data and their quoted errors seriously which resulted in uncovering this controversial issue . ref .",

    "at least one of these data sets needs to be reassessed , particularly concerning systematic errors .",
    "the neutrino dimuon results were not included in the cteq1 analysis because experimental data in this process are not , so far , available in the form of detector - independent physical quantities ( i.e. structure functions ) which can be included in a global analysis treating all data on the same footing . in view of the resulting inconsistency , the cteq2 analysis takes the complementary approach of making direct use of the strange quark distribution function obtained by the ccfr collaboration from their parton model analysis of the dimuon data , thereby setting this process apart from all the other experimental input .",
    "obviously , neither approach is completely satisfactory .",
    "eventually , we need to understand the source of the inconsistency , and perform a consistent global analysis including measured dimuon structure functions , thereby avoiding a separate treatment of the strange quark .    there is another process which is potentially sensitive to the size of the strange sea .",

    "@xmath152  @xmath187 the @xmath137 ratio not only directly impacts on the w - charge asymmetry ( @xmath73-dependence ) , it also has an influence on the @xmath51 distribution of decaying leptons in w - production which is critical to the understanding of precision measurement of the @xmath12 mass .",
    "how can one assess the uncertainties on the parton distributions which affect qcd predictions on these important quantities ?",
    "as mentioned earlier , using the range spanned by some set of canned distributions which fit the @xmath175 data to varying degrees of goodness as an estimate on the uncertainty is not a satisfying strategy . in the current round of cteq analysis , we have performed a number of studies to explore this problem .",
    "as an example , we show in fig.[fig : w]a two fits to the global data in addition to cteq3 m with the requirement that the `` upper '' one gives rise to a w - lepton asymmetry @xmath175 about one standard deviation above the cdf data , and the `` lower '' one to values of @xmath175 one standard deviation below the cdf data .",
    "the slope of the @xmath137 ratio from these three sets of parton distributions are shown in fig.[fig : w]b .",
    "since all three sets give rise to comparable fits to the rest of the global data sets ( with cteq3 m being the best fit ) , the differences exhibited here perhaps represent more realistically the uncertainty associated with this quantity .    the w - mass measurement , although also sensitive to the @xmath36 and @xmath35 distributions , is not dependent on this same quantity .",
    "to arrive at a meaningful assessment of the uncertainties due to parton distributions , it is desirable to perform a similar study as above but focused on the @xmath186 spectrum on which the mass determination depends .",
    "such a study is underway .",
    "@xmath152  * su(2 ) flavor asymmetry of sea quarks ",
    "@xmath188 : * as noted in the previous section , important progress has been made on the difference between @xmath151 and @xmath150 quarks .",
    "the main contributing processes are dis structure functions on proton , deuterium and nuclear targets , lepton - pair production , and the recent @xmath175 measurement . do the differences between the mrsa and cteq3 m ( @xmath131 )",
    "function shown in fig.[fig : dmu1 ] reflect the current uncertainty on this quantity ?",
    "( this question has important bearing on the validity of the gottfried sum rule . )",
    "a closer look at the @xmath189 for these two sets shown in table [ tbl : chisq ] indicates that over half of the difference comes from the very precise bcdms sets .",
    "a further examination of the individual data points reveals that much of the extra @xmath37 occurs at the small-@xmath21 end of the bcdms @xmath190 data set .",
    "this is the @xmath21 range where the ( @xmath131 ) function shows a difference in fig.[fig : dmu1 ] .",
    "this difference may be partially related to our exclusion of the conflicting ccfr and nmc @xmath30 data below @xmath172 .",
    "one theoretical uncertainty in this region concerns the size of shadowing corrections to the deuterium measurement .",
    "we have made independent analyses with and without deuterium corrections ( based on ref.@xcite ) and found that the differences between the resulting parton distributions were insignificant , and that the above conclusions were unaffected .    in order to obtain a self - contained estimate of the uncertainty of the ( @xmath131 ) function",
    ", we have performed a series of fits systematically varying the @xmath162 parameter of this function at @xmath99 .",
    "fig.[fig : dmu2 ] shows a band of curves representing the resulting ( @xmath131 ) at @xmath149 gev .",
    "the overall @xmath37 of these fits , as well as their distribution among the various experiments , are very similar  except that those vanishing faster toward small-@xmath21 in general give better fits to the cdf @xmath191 data .",
    "this band plot gives an indication on the uncertainty of ( @xmath192 ) under the conditions described above .",
    "a more detailed study of this problem and its implication on the gottfried sum rule is still underway .",
    "we remark that there is a proposed ( and approved ) experiment at fermilab , e866 , which will measure this quantity over the kinematic region in question . with the recent developments , this measurement acquires even more significance .",

    "* @xmath193 as discussed in some detail in sections [ subs : cteq1]*-*[subs : cteq3 ] , the strange quark distribution is not included in current global analyses on the same footing as the non - strange quarks .",
    "the mrs and cteq3 analyses both adopt the assumption that @xmath194 .",
    "this is consistent with the neutrino dimuon data ; but causes problems with the available inclusive @xmath119 and @xmath118 data at small-@xmath195 . to see this problem ,",
    "we show in fig.[fig : ftomunu ] the @xmath119 and @xmath118 data in the range @xmath24 and @xmath196 gev@xmath159 compared to cteq3 m and mrsa curves .",
    "points are converted from @xmath197 data by using the ratio @xmath198 , ( a = ca , fe ) , measured by nmc .",
    "the nmc ratio is consistent with the only , much less accurate , neutrino shadowing measurement @xcite , and with predictions from pcac @xcite . ]",
    "the cteq2 and cteq3 analyses leave out these data points because their simultaneous inclusion is inconsistent with the assumption made on the strange distribution in the fitting process , as revealed in the cteq1 analysis .",
    "the mrs analyses include these data in the fit , seeking a best comprise .",
    "thus , the mrsa curves are closer to the data points in fig.[fig : ftomunu ] , but at the expense of higher overall @xmath37  particularly on the bcdms measurements .",
    "it appears that , this discrepancy needs to be understood before we can have complete confidence in our knowledge on @xmath114 .",
    "the sequence of analyses reported here give a realistic view of the manner in which progress in theory and experiment interact as the characteristics of the various parton distributions are investigated .",
    "the latest version of cteq analysis , cteq3 , provides an excellent description of a wealth of data covering an extended range in both @xmath31 and @xmath21 compared to what was available just a few years ago .",
    "the precision of the data and the diversity of physical processes together allow detailed investigations of _ fine structures _ such as the breaking of flavor symmetry in the sea . where possible we indicated remaining sources of uncertainty and suggested what types of data might help to reduce this in the future . one interesting area concerns the small-@xmath21 behavior of the gluon and how to reconcile its behavior there with observables which are sensitive to the behavior at moderate to large values of @xmath21 .",
    "certainly future collider measurements of jet and photon production will play a leading role in such studies .",
    "the remaining uncertainties on quark distributions concern detailed flavor differentiation , particularly among the sea quarks .",
    "new measurements on vector boson production ( w- , z- and continuum lepton - pair ) will be valuable , as illustrated by the first cdf results on @xmath199 and na51 on @xmath130 ; and clarification of the difference between @xmath119 and @xmath118 data in the range @xmath24 is sorely needed .    related projects which are underway and will be reported separately cover a range of topics relevant to the global analysis of pdf s .",
    "these include a comprehensive survey of direct photon measurements spanning the range from fixed target to collider energies , a detailed examination of issues related to the choice of parametrizations and the effects on the description of individual experiments , and a method of estimating errors on predictions due to the uncertainties associated with the parton distribution determinations .",
    "the results presented here should be considered in the same sense as a snapshot showing the state of the subject at one instant of time . as",
    "new data and calculations become available , the underlying qcd framework will be ever more critically tested , and further progress toward a unique determination of parton distributions will be made .",
    "we would like to thank our colleagues in the cteq collaboration for many lively discussions and useful suggestions .",
    "we also would like to note that a global analysis project of this scope necessarily involves indirect contributions from a wide spectrum of sources worldwide through constant communications with many physicists , particularly some key members of experiments whose data are used in the analyses .",
    "these sources are too numerous to name individually .",
    "likewise , the programs used to perform these analyses , although mostly developed by us , do contain elements from other sources and involve some contribution from our cteq colleagues , to all of whom we express our thanks ."
