    "unipolar quantum cascade ( qc ) laser devices@xcite are intraband semiconductor devices in which the transport processes and optical ( intersubband ) transitions which give rise to the lasing operation occur only in the conduction band of the semiconductor structure .",
    "this marks a departure from previous interband semiconductor lasers . since the first realization of a qc laser",
    ", there has been a proliferation of qc laser designs.@xcite qc laser structures are composed of a complicated sequence of semiconductor layers with different material compositions and thicknesses .",
    "this sequence is repeated tens or hundreds of times giving rise to a periodic structure in the device . considering the complicated layer composition of these devices , the nature of the charge transport process through these structures",
    "is not immediately apparent .",
    "the original concept by kazarinov and suris@xcite was based on coherent tunneling between neighboring wells .",
    "it was soon realized however that scattering plays a crucial role in establishing the nonequilibrium carrier distribution , in particular for the depopulation of the lower laser level .",
    "thus almost all simulations of transport@xcite in qc structures assume a semiclassical model , in which the transport occurs through scattering transitions between energy eigenstates ( wannier - stark hopping @xcite ) .",
    "in such an approach only diagonal elements of the density matrix ( populations or distribution functions ) in the wannier - stark basis are used , and offdiagonal elements are neglected ( hence , the term semiclassical ) . ref .   briefly considered a more fully quantum - mechanical extension to this semiclassical approach by also including offdiagonal elements ( coherences ) of the density matrix in the calculation .",
    "this study concluded that quantum - mechanical coherences were of limited importance to the transport properties .",
    "however , coherent effects were observed experimentally for the electron transfer from the injector to the upper laser level in qc structures.@xcite the importance of coherent effects has also recently been stressed by ref .  , where a simplified calculation scheme is proposed .",
    "the concept that scattering transitions propel the current through heterostructure systems conflicts with the standard description of transport in bulk structures , where complex bloch functions carry the current , while scattering redistributes the carriers in momentum space but does not change their spatial positions.@xcite we will show that a similar description also holds in quantum cascade lasers where the current is carried by quantum - mechanical wavepackets , and the scattering only acts locally redistributing carriers in energy or momentum .",
    "the quantum - mechanical transport theory we use here is based on nonequilibrium green s functions which allow for a consistent combination of scattering and coherent evolution .",
    "quantum - mechanical coherences are represented by offdiagonal elements of the @xmath0 correlation function , which is related to the density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the theory is formulated with basis states @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the envelope function in the growth direction @xmath4 .",
    "the wavevector @xmath5 and the spatial coordinate @xmath6 are two - dimensional vectors in the plane of each semiconductor layer ( with normalization area @xmath7 ) , taking fully into account the three - dimensional nature of the structure .",
    "we divide the total hamiltonian as @xmath8 .",
    "the free hamiltonian @xmath9 contains the kinetic energy and applied voltage , together with the electron - electron interaction in a mean field approximation .",
    "it is diagonal in * k * , while @xmath10 describes scattering interactions @xmath11 .",
    "here we explicitly take into account acoustic phonon and longitudinal optical phonon , impurity , and interface roughness scattering processes .",
    "@xmath10 is treated perturbatively using self - energies in the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "for example , for impurity scattering , the self - energy has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the impurity scattering potential . and",
    "self - energies for other scattering processes , see ref .  .",
    "impurity scattering is treated microscopically as in ref .  .",
    "we only treat electron - electron scattering in a mean field approximation , but it has been shown that for intersubband transport , electron - impurity scattering usually dominates over electron - electron scattering , see callebaut , kumar , williams , hu , and reno , appl .",

    "this results in the determination of the full correlation function @xmath14 , which describes the nonequilibrium state of the device .",
    "current densities are defined as @xmath15 with @xmath16\\rangle}{\\mathcal{v}\\hbar }      = \\frac{2e}{\\hbar\\mathcal{v}}\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta,{\\bf k } } \\int \\frac{de}{2\\pi } [ \\hat{h}_o , \\hat{z}]_{\\alpha\\beta } g^<_{\\beta\\alpha,{\\bf k}}(e ) \\label{eq.jo}\\ ] ] and @xmath17\\rangle/\\mathcal{v}\\hbar$ ] .",

    "it was shown that @xmath20 provides the hopping current due to scattering transitions between the states if one restricts to diagonal green functions and self - energies , i.e. neglects coherences between the states .",
    "thus this part was referred to as scattering current , reflecting the ( mis-)conception that current flow occurs by a combination of both coherent evolution ( @xmath21 ) and relocation by scattering transitions . in the following",

    "spatially - localized wannier states were used as an orthonormal set of @xmath3 , which can be constructed for the infinitely extended qc structure in a straightforward manner and generate a well - defined periodic hamiltonian .",
    "a second type of states are the wannier - stark states , which are the eigenstates of @xmath9 .",
    "they can be easily obtained by diagonalizing @xmath9 in the basis of wannier states .",
    "( this procedure avoids the common use of an artificial spatial confinement . )",
    "a third type of states constitutes the position eigenstate basis , using the eigenfunctions of the position operator @xmath26 .",
    "again we start with the wannier basis , diagonalize @xmath26 , and transform @xmath27 into the new basis . in all bases we evaluate the scattering matrix elements directly for the respective basis functions .",
    "_ structures : _ the data presented below was obtained using two typical examples : ( a ) a midinfrared qc laser@xcite and ( b ) a thz qc laser.@xcite in the calculation we restrict the number of basis functions to 9 ( 5 ) per period for structures a ( b ) .",
    "in ref .  , we neglected the offdiagonal elements of the self - energies , i.e. , only terms with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( diagonal self - energy , dg in table [ tab.pot ] ) were included in eq .",
    "( [ eq.ndsig ] ) . in this restricted theory , we found @xmath21 and @xmath20 to be similar in magnitude .",
    "in contrast , using the more rigorous and complete formulation of the theory reported here , where all self - energy terms are included ( nondiagonal self - energies , nd ) , we find that @xmath30 .",
    "this result is basis invariant if the complete nondiagonal self - energies ( nd ) are used , as we checked this explicitly ( numerically ) for all three types of basis sets .",
    "hence the total current density is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the same result has recently been analytically demonstrated by lake and pandey:@xcite in the position eigenstate basis , where the matrix @xmath31 is diagonal , the expression ( 16 ) for @xmath20 of ref .",
    "becomes @xmath32 now the term in brackets corresponds to the right - hand side of the continuity equation as given in eq .",
    "( 57 ) of ref .",
    ", which has to vanish . see also section 2.4 of ref .  .",
    "a second line of argument runs as follows : for microscopic scattering potentials which only depend on @xmath33 ( but not on momentum @xmath34 ) , the commutator @xmath35 $ ] vanishes and hence @xmath36 by its definition .",
    "thus @xmath36 holds for a wider class of scattering processes , including electron - electron scattering , than studied numerically here .",
    "these analytic arguments demonstrate that the previous observation of a finite @xmath20 in ref .",
    "is an unphysical result caused by the dg - approximation in the self - energies for a nonlocal basis of wannier functions .",
    "although @xmath20 vanishes this does not imply that scattering processes are absent from the transport process .",
    "these processes do not appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq.jo ] ) but they act implicitly in determining @xmath37 , and hence in driving the current @xmath21 .",
    "we now investigate the role played by scattering processes in determining @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we seek to establish if each scattering event results in a spatial displacement of charge , or if a scattering process acts locally resulting in energy redistribution but with no accompanying spatial transport .",
    "this issue can be conveniently addressed within the basis of position eigenstates .",
    "in contrast to the wannier wavefunctions [ fig .",
    "[ fig.wfa](a ) ] , these position eigenfunctions are localized to within a single well layer in the structure [ see fig .",
    "[ fig.wfa](b ) ] and the scattering potential matrix elements @xmath38 are significantly smaller for @xmath39 than for @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore compare the effect of excluding or including certain scattering potential terms in the self - energies , see table [ tab.pot ] .    ;",
    "@xmath41 in both cases . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig.jfrei ] shows that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are almost identical for both samples .",
    "this indicates that the potential terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 constitute the main contribution to the self - energies in the calculation of @xmath43 , our most rigorous formulation of the current .",
    "these scattering terms involve only purely local ( in space ) transitions , as @xmath25 represents a transition matrix element between states with the same envelope function @xmath46 , i.e. , localized to the same well .",
    "this implies that the scattering processes act only locally in space .",
    "they do not cause spatial displacement of charge , but act only to redistribute momentum * k * and energy .",
    "a key point of our argument was the use of the position eigenstate basis which enabled us to demonstrate that the dominant scattering processes in @xmath21 act locally and therefore do not contribute to the spatial transport of charge by @xmath21 .",
    "this result is not evident if we work in another basis , e.g. , wannier or wannier - stark , where the wavefunctions are far more delocalized and off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath47 play a significant role . nevertheless , physical mechanisms , such as the nature of transport , must be basis invariant . indeed ,",
    "as long as the full self - energies are taken into account , the expression for the currents @xmath48 and @xmath49 are invariant under basis transformations .",
    "this demonstrates that the same result is recovered even in the case of a delocalized basis , where the interplay of all types of matrix elements in table [ tab.pot ] reproduces the locality of scattering transitions .",
    "in contrast , the neglect of certain matrix element combinations ( such as the dg - approximation ) generates spurious nonlocal scattering transition in a delocalized basis .",
    "as we have just seen , the scattering processes which contribute to @xmath21 have a purely local effect which does not spatially displace carriers .",
    "hence , we conclude that the transport of charge by @xmath21 through the structure must arise as a property of the quantum - mechanical wavefunction .",
    "we can obtain a more concrete visualization of this transport mechanism by resolving @xmath21 in energy and space : @xmath50    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.jez ] show that the current @xmath51 flows at different energies in different spatial regions of the structures . to satisfy the equation of continuity , scattering interactions enable energy transitions which occur locally as discussed above ( an example is depicted by the vertical arrow in the figure ) .",

    "numerically , we observe a spatial variation due to the limited number of basis states used in the calculation . increasing the number of basis states to 8 wannier states per period (",

    "[ fig.jezsir ] shows the corresponding result for sample a. here the current density is restricted to a narrow energy range while crossing the thick barrier ( around @xmath66 nm ) between the injector and the active region , thus providing the desired selective feeding of the upper laser level .",

    "an especially intuitive form of eq .",
    "( [ eq.joez ] ) can be obtained by transforming into an ( energy - dependent ) basis of eigenstates of the hermitian matrix @xmath67 which has real eigenvalues @xmath68 . while @xmath68 exhibits sharp peaks in energy , the eigenstates @xmath57 exhibit only a weak energy dependence ( not shown for brevity ) .",
    "then we find @xmath69 thus , the energy - resolved current is carried by wave functions @xmath57 with occupation densities @xmath68 ( the factor 2 is due to spin ) .",
    "this is analogous to the bloch functions and their occupation in standard bulk transport .",
    "the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.jez ] show that these current carrying states @xmath57 extend over a range of one period .",
    "this length scale gives a measure of the coherence length , i.e. , the distance over which charge is transported by a single coherent wave packet .",
    "the peaks in density @xmath55 are localized in the wells as charge tends to accumulate in the low - potential regions .",
    "the currents carried by the wave functions @xmath57 are more evenly distributed which reflects the ability of the wave packets to transport charge across the structure .",
    "note the nonvanishing divergence of current density which reflects the local balance of scattering processes .",
    "thus , these complex wave functions @xmath57 can be viewed as generalized states for a nonequilibrium system , where the drive by bias and scattering processes compensate .",
    "the currents associated with these wavepackets can differ significantly : the state at -29.2 mev ( corresponding to the upper laser level ) has only a small current , but a high occupation .",
    "in contrast , the state at @xmath70 mev ( lower laser level ) exhibits a strong current to the right , effectively moving electrons away from the lasing transition which occurs vertically between these states .",
    "there are also states exhibiting local current flow to the left , e.g. , at @xmath71 mev .",
    "such considerations may provide new tools for the optimization and design of new laser structures .",
    "the complex states @xmath57 are of particular importance at level crossings .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figlevelcross ] for a simple superlattice at the resonance between the ground state and the first excited state of the neighboring well .",
    "[ figlevelcross](a ) depicts the wannier - stark states , which are spread over both wells .",
    "the first two eigenvalues @xmath60 ( for @xmath58 ) exhibit a clear peak at the level energies [ see fig .",
    "[ figlevelcross](b ) ] and the corresponding states , carry particles to the right [ state 1 , fig .",
    "[ figlevelcross](c ) ] and to the left [ state 2 , fig .",
    "[ figlevelcross](d ) ] .",
    "however , the occupation of the state 1 is about two orders of magnitude larger thus providing a strong current flux over the barrier .",
    "of @xmath67 for @xmath58 .",
    "( c , d ) corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath72 at @xmath73 for the two largest eigenvalues , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . ]",
    "our viewpoint of current - carrying coherent wave - functions differs essentially from the conception that scattering transitions propel the current .",
    "this manifests itself in two ways : ( i ) in a scattering transition picture , the current would stop immediately once the scattering processes stop ( @xmath76 drops to zero ) .",
    "however , the occupation of current - carrying wave - functions only changes on the scale of the scattering time , thus the current flow will continue on this time scale .",
    "( ii ) the current is sensitive to quantum mechanical phases .",
    "e.g. , phase conjugation would reverse the direction of @xmath21 , while scattering rates would be unaffected .",
    "in the wannier - stark hopping model , the current is carried by scattering transitions between wannier - stark states and depends only on scattering rates and the populations of these states .",
    "the coherences , i.e. , offdiagonal elements @xmath77 ( diagonal in @xmath5 in contrast to scattering transition amplitudes @xmath78 ) of the density matrix , play no role in this model and are neglected .",
    "there are two peculiarities in this picture : ( i ) the wannier - stark hopping picture of transport through scattering transitions and our picture of transport by coherent wavepackets each provide the entire current and yet offer such conflicting views of the transport mechanism .",
    "( ii ) if we examine eq .  ( [ eq.jo ] ) expressed in the wannier - stark basis , we see that a diagonal density matrix results in zero total current . thus ,",
    "coherences are central to the transport process , even in the wannier - stark basis , see also ref .  .",
    "this conflicts with the common wannier - stark hopping picture .",
    "how do we reconcile these contradictions ?",
    "the answer is that the wannier - stark hopping model is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq.jo ] ) by expressing , in a low - order approximation , the offdiagonal elements of the density matrix in terms of the diagonal elements.@xcite under conditions where such an approximation is applicable the wannier - stark hopping model gives the same results as a full quantum transport model ( see , e.g. , ref .   for superlattices ) , but it should be remembered that the wannier - stark hopping model uses populations which are in actual fact an approximation for the coherences .    following the concepts of standard quantum optics , one is tempted to assume that coherences are created by the electric field and destroyed by scattering . however , the opposite is true in the quantum treatment of transport within the basis of wannier - stark states , which are eigenstates of @xmath9 including the electrostatic potential . here",
    "coherences are induced by the scattering processes via the non - diagonal self - energies , which are crucial in a consistent quantum treatment .",
    "we have shown that the entire current through qc structures is carried only by complex , quantum - mechanical wavefunctions as shown , e.g. , in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.jez ] .",
    "this conclusion follows from two main results : ( i ) the scattering current @xmath20 vanishes , which directly follows from @xmath35=0 $ ] , if the scattering potentials couple to the spatial coordinate of electron states .",
    "( ii ) in the position basis , only the diagonal scattering matrix elements @xmath25 are significant in determining the current @xmath21 , and hence the entire current .",
    "such matrix elements do not induce spatial translation of the electron state within the scattering transition .",
    "thus , the principal scattering events which transfer momentum and/or dissipate energy in the transport process in quantum cascade structures occur only through spatially - local transitions which do not give rise to propagation of charge .",
    "the locality of scattering transitions contrasts with the simple picture of electrons hopping between energy eigenstates due to scattering events , which is a common description in heterostructure systems . on the other hand ,",
    "our point of view is analogous to bulk transport , where the scattering term in boltzmann s equation is local in space , and the entire current is carried by bloch states ."
