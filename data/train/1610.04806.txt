    "consequently , as in the case of the slow telegraph noise , we again come to the conclusion that finite-@xmath1 correction can dominate the result .",
    "since we are interested in the domain @xmath195 , standard @xmath196 asymptotes of the parabolic cylinder function [ ] are insufficient .",
    "therefore , we start from the following integral representation      it is convenient to divide the integral eq . into two parts @xmath198 where the functions @xmath199 and @xmath200 are defined as @xmath201 the advantage of introducing @xmath202 and @xmath203",

    "we rewrite @xmath202 in the form @xmath204 the extrema of @xmath205 correspond to @xmath206 .",
    "the real part of @xmath207 is positive , and thus lies within the domain of integration .",

    "( [ 5 ] ) is much smaller than @xmath207 .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath195 this condition is satisfied when @xmath73 , i.e. in the case we are interested in .",
    "calculation of @xmath200 is similar to the above calculation .",
    "the saddle points are @xmath212 , and only @xmath213 contributes to the integral .",
    "the result reads @xmath214 naturally , the result eq .",

    "indeed , in this limit , the denominator in the fraction turns to @xmath222 , while the numerator turns to @xmath223 .",

    "since the integral representation of @xmath217 contains @xmath48 in the form of @xmath227 in the integrand , evaluation of the asymptote of @xmath228 with the steepest descent simply amounts to dividing the result for @xmath199 by @xmath207 , and the result for @xmath200 by @xmath229 .",
