    "the so - called centaur population consists of objects with perihelia beyond jupiter but orbital semimajor axes smaller than neptune s .",
    "their orbits are unstable on timescales of about @xmath6 to @xmath7 yr @xcite due to perturbations by the giant planets and are in dynamical transition from the trans - neptunian kuiper belt to the inner solar system .",
    "those centaurs that are not thrown from the solar system or impact planets or the sun are transferred into typical jupiter - family comet - like orbits ; thus the centaurs hold a direct evolutionary link between the cometary and trans - neptunian populations .",
    "the colors of many centaurs , extinct comet candidates , and active comets @xcite are consistent with this dynamical picture , and further physical and compositional studies will let us understand the physical evolution . moreover ,",
    "since the centaurs are generally brighter than the trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) , they provide a proxy through which we can infer the ensemble properties of that more distant population .    the spectral diversity of the centaurs and tnos is well established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the primary cause of this phenomenon is unknown .",
    "a secondary cause is probably the competition between reddening by cosmic - ray - induced surface chemistry and impacts exposing sub - surface icy material @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism might also have observable effects on the albedo as a function of object size and color .",
    "furthermore , cometary activity , e.g. as shown by chiron , may significantly influence the albedo as icy grains on ballistic trajectories dust the surface .",
    "thus , sampling the centaur and tno albedos could provide clues to the physical nature of their surfaces .    in this paper",
    "we describe the determination of the geometric albedos and sizes of two centaurs , chiron and asbolus , using the radiometric method .",
    "we will place the chiron dataset in the context of earlier work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the observations span two wavelength regimes , mid - infrared ( mir ) and visible .",
    "the mir data were obtained with the keck i telescope using the `` lws '' @xmath8-pixel camera @xcite , and the visible - wavelength data were obtained with the uh 2.2-m telescope using a tektronix @xmath9-pixel charge - coupled device ( ccd ) .",
    "table 1 gives the observational circumstances of the two targets and the measured fluxes .",
    "the objects were unresolved at mir wavelengths .",
    "no visible - wavelength data were obtained for ( 8405 ) asbolus so for our analysis we use results published by others .",
    "the mir data were obtained using chopping and nodding , both with throws of 4 arcsec .",
    "non - sidereal guiding was used for each target .",
    "flat fields were obtained by comparing staring images taken at both high and low airmass .",
    "the seeing was about 0.3 arcsec full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) at 12.5 @xmath10 m and 0.45 arcsec fwhm ( diffraction - limited ) at 17.9 @xmath10 m .",
    "flux calibration was done by comparing count rates to the following known ( 12.5 and 17.9 @xmath10 m ) flux densities of standard stars : @xmath11 lyr , 26.4 jy and 12.9 jy ; @xmath12 lib , 120.7 jy and 58.9 jy ; @xmath11 crb , 3.64 jy and 1.97 jy ; @xmath13 aql , 54.2 jy and 27.5 jy .",
    "these values are derived from the standard system in use at ukirt @xcite and the magnitudes given by @xcite .",
    "we corrected for atmospheric extinction by comparing the stars photometry over a range of airmasses .",
    "as the filters we used are only 10% wide , the correction to monochromatic magnitudes was 0.01 mag or less , and so was ignored .",
    "the visible - wavelength image was obtained while guiding on a nearby star at a sidereal tracking rate in seeing that was 1 arcsec fwhm .",
    "a flat field was constructed by combining dithered images of the blank twilight sky .",
    "flux calibration and airmass corrections were obtained by repeated measurements of the @xcite standard stars sa 107 - 457 , 104 - 485 , and 112 - 250 .",
    "chiron displayed a faint coma , as was expected , but the light was dominated by the nucleus .",
    "we used an aperture of radius 1.1 arcsec to minimize the coma s contribution .",
    "the basic radiometric method to obtain an effective radius , @xmath1 , and geometric albedo , @xmath0 , is to solve two equations with these two unknowns , first done about 30 years ago @xcite and described in detail by @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the measured flux density ( in e.g. w m@xmath16 hz@xmath17 ) of the object at wavelength @xmath18 in the visible ( `` vis '' ) or mid - infrared ( `` mir '' ) ; @xmath19 is the flux density of the sun at earth as a function of wavelength ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the object s heliocentric and geocentric distances , respectively ; @xmath22 is the ( dimensionless ) phase function in each regime ; @xmath23 is the planck function ( in e.g. w m@xmath16 hz@xmath17 sr@xmath17 ) ; @xmath24 is the ( dimensionless ) infrared emissivity ; @xmath25 is a ( dimensionless ) factor to account for infrared beaming ; and @xmath26 is the temperature . the temperature itself is a function of the geometric albedo @xmath0 , surface planetographic coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the ( dimensionless ) phase integral @xmath29 which links the geometric and bond albedos . for lack of detailed shape information  as is the case for our two objects  the modeled body is assumed to be spherical .",
    "we employ the `` standard thermal model '' ( stm ) for slow - rotators @xcite to derive the function @xmath26 and evaluate eqs .",
    "1 . in the stm",
    ", the rotation is assumed to be so slow and/or the thermal inertia so small that every point on the surface is in instantaneous equilibrium with the impinging solar radiation .",
    "we will show below that the other extreme , a model assuming a fast - rotator with a rotation axis perpendicular to the sun - earth - object plane , is inconsistent with the measured color temperatures .",
    "the other parameters to the models are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath29 .",
    "emissivity is close to unity and we will assume @xmath32 here .",
    "the beaming parameter is known for only a few of the largest asteroids , but to facilitate comparison with other work we adopt the standard value @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath30 we assume that the magnitude scales with the phase angle @xmath11 : @xmath34 , where , based on earlier work @xcite , @xmath35 mag / deg @xmath36 mag / deg .",
    "in the much - better studied visible regime , we use the @xmath37 formalism @xcite to obtain @xmath31 .",
    "the slope parameter @xmath38 ranges between 0.0 and 0.7 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 determines @xmath29 , but since that has a minor effect on the modeling we adopt @xmath39 , the integral s value for @xmath40 .",
    "note that our observations all occurred at small @xmath11 ( table 1 ) .",
    "we should note that the values for @xmath1 and @xmath0 are valid in the context of the model used , but since the thermal model represents an extremum of thermal behavior it is not a perfect descriptor .",
    "the error bars here and in many other published reports usually do not describe the systematic errors from the model itself . however , such errors are likely to be comparable to the quoted formal errors so the values are still physically meaningful .",
    "we did not obtain our own visible - wavelength measurements of asbolus , but photometry by @xcite provides an excellent constraint .",
    "they measured a mean absolute magnitude of @xmath41 in @xmath1 band .",
    "since our mir measurements were taken at an unknown rotational phase , and the peak - to - valley amplitude is about 0.4 mag , we adopt a @xmath42 mag uncertainty . with this visible - wavelength information and our june 23 mid - ir photometry ( see table 1 ) , the stm provides @xmath26 and eqs . 1 yield asbolus effective radius @xmath1 and geometric albedo @xmath0 . since there are not enough data points to perform the @xmath43 statistical test , we have found instead the range of values for @xmath1 and @xmath0 such that the model passes within 2@xmath12 of all data points .",
    "the ranges , means ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , and standard deviations are :    @xmath46    we note that the object was a few mjy brighter on june 21 compared to june 23 ; the time difference is 5.35 rotation periods @xcite , and the magnitude difference is @xmath47 .",
    "this is consistent with rotational modulation caused by a changing cross section , since in that case the mid - ir and visible amplitudes would be the same .",
    "however we do not know the exact rotational phase of the mid - ir data since the uncertainty in the magnitude difference is too big .",
    "( otherwise we could find the position on a sine curve corresponding to that shift in rotation phase and change in brightness . ) at worst our data correspond to a minimum or maximum in brightness , but a 0.20 mag shift would affect @xmath1 by only about 1% ( since the object is dark ) and @xmath0 by 15 to 20% .",
    "the stm predicts a ( 12.5- to 17.9-@xmath10 m ) color temperature @xmath48 k , while our photometry shows @xmath49 k @xmath50 k. by comparison , the fast - rotator model mentioned previously predicts @xmath51 k , so that model is inapplicable . since the spin period of asbolus is not exceptionally slow  about 8.9 h @xcite  the other contributing effect , the thermal inertia , must be low .",
    "a caveat is that the fast - rotator model degenerates into the slow - rotator model for a rotation axis pointing at the sun , which could deceive us in interpreting the thermal inertia .",
    "however , the fact that ( a ) asbolus has a large photometric amplitude @xcite and ( b ) @xcite have reported spectroscopic variation over the course of a rotation make a pole - on point of view unlikely .",
    "note that the lack of rotational context prevents us from matching our albedo to the reported spectroscopic variation .",
    "given that the object is a slow rotator , we can calculate an upper limit to the thermal inertia .",
    "the dimensionless thermal parameter @xmath52 , introduced by @xcite , is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the thermal inertia , @xmath55 is the rotational frequency , @xmath12 is the stefan - boltzmann constant ( in e.g. w m@xmath16 k@xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 is the subsolar equilibrium temperature .",
    "this parameter is less than unity for a slow - rotator ( and zero for a body that is non - rotating or has no thermal inertia ) , and greater than unity for a fast - rotator .",
    "thermal inertia itself is defined as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the object s bulk density ( in e.g. kg m@xmath60 ) , @xmath61 is the heat capacity ( in e.g. j kg@xmath17 k@xmath17 ) , and @xmath62 is the conductivity ( in e.g. w m@xmath17 k@xmath17 ) .",
    "thus @xmath54 gives clues to the internal thermal behavior . at asbolus heliocentric distance ( with @xmath32 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 k , so @xmath66 requires that @xmath67 j m@xmath16 s@xmath68 k@xmath17 . by comparison , in the same units , ceres value is about 10 @xcite ; the moon , 50 @xcite ; europa , about 45 - 70 @xcite , ganymede , 70 @xcite ; near - earth asteroid eros , 170 @xcite ; and near - earth asteroid phaethon , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "asbolus limit of 10.5 argues for a relatively porous and/or rough surface ",
    "perhaps a regolith , perhaps the aftermath of episodic cometary activity  inhibiting heat flow .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 is not yet known for any typical cometary nucleus .      with our visible - wavelength and 12.5-@xmath10 m photometry from table 1 , the stm provides @xmath26 and eqs .",
    "1 yield chiron s effective radius @xmath1 and geometric albedo @xmath0 .",
    "again , since there are not enough data points to permit the @xmath43 statistical test , we have found instead the range of values for @xmath1 and @xmath0 such that the model passes within 2@xmath12 of all data points .",
    "the ranges , means , and standard deviations are :    @xmath70    we note that chiron appeared slightly brighter on june 21 compared to june 23 ( table 1 ) , but the magnitude difference , @xmath71 , is consistent with no change .",
    "since chiron has a small rotational amplitude , 0.1 mag or less , this is expected and finding the rotational context is not as critical as for asbolus .",
    "the stm predicts a ( 12.5- to 17.9-@xmath10 m ) color temperature of @xmath72 k. our photometry shows @xmath73 k @xmath74 k , which is about 1.75@xmath12 higher but clearly a better match than the fast - rotator model , which predicts @xmath75 k. since the spin period of chiron is not exceptionally slow  about 5.9178 h @xcite  the thermal inertia must be low .",
    "the same inertia caveat as for asbolus may be applied here , but there is some evidence that we do not view the axis pole - on . the photometric variation due to rotation , which is less than 0.1 mag @xcite , does not change with ecliptic longitude after accounting for damping by the coma @xcite .    independently , @xcite have used a `` mixed model '' thermal model of chiron s surface , integrating the thermal properties of water ice and refractory grains , to constrain the thermal inertia from _",
    "iso_+isophot mid- and far - ir photometry @xcite .",
    "they obtain @xmath76 j m@xmath16 s@xmath68 k@xmath17 , similar to asbolus limiting value from above .",
    "critical for the determination of the albedo is a robust measurement of the nucleus visible - wavelength flux density without contamination from comatic light . as a check",
    ", we can compare our measured magnitude to the long - term photometric behavior of chiron . in early 1985 chiron",
    "appears to have been at one of its intrinsically faintest points @xcite , judging by the light curve over the last 30 years @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a v band absolute magnitude @xmath77 , assuming the slope parameter @xmath78 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath38 is high and introduces several tenths of a magnitude of uncertainty to @xmath79 , so here we shall instead refer magnitudes to the phase angle of their observations , @xmath80 on ut 1985 january 19 .",
    "this is convenient not only because we avoid having to worry about most of the opposition surge , but also because chiron had a similar phase angle during our visible - wavelength observations .",
    "thus , whereas @xmath81 , let us define @xmath82 from the data published by @xcite for ut 1985 january 19 , we calculate that @xmath83 .",
    "now , regarding our photometry , the phase angle was @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath85 , which is a range that covers nearly all of the asteroids for which slope parameters are known , then @xmath86 mag .",
    "chiron has nearly solar colors @xcite , so @xmath87 , and substituting the data from table 1 into eq .",
    "5 yields @xmath88 .",
    "thus chiron was only about 0.11 mag brighter than its faintest point in early 1985 .",
    "since the rotational phase was unknown , effectively the difference is @xmath89 mag , but the nucleus provided about 90% of the measured flux density during our observations .",
    "figures 1 and 2 display our current understanding of albedos among the centaurs and related bodies .",
    "the data were taken from this work and from many other published sources ; the plotted error bars are those cited by the various authors .    in fig . 1",
    ", we plot albedo vs. effective radius ( top ) and vs. perihelion distance ( bottom ) .",
    "we have only included objects with both reliable radii and albedos , and we have excluded pluto since its surface is strongly influenced by atmospheric effects . a trend with perihelion would suggest that the albedo is altered by thermal processing from insolation , but there is no apparent correlation in the plot .",
    "the addition of active and dormant comets in the 2 - 5 au range would be useful .",
    "a trend with radius among the outer solar system objects might imply a connection between the albedo and effects that depend on cross section ( such as the impact rate ) , and here , if we calculate the linear - correlation coefficient , there is a correlation on the 3@xmath12 level ( as also noted by @xcite ) .",
    "however this correlation is solely due to charon , at @xmath90 km , @xmath91 .",
    "the distribution of albedos itself however readily reveals that there is a greater diversity among the centaurs than among the comets .",
    "activity might yield a spuriously high albedo  since in that case one could overestimate the visible - wavelength flux  but for the inactive asbolus that is inapplicable .",
    "it appears that during the dynamical cascade from the kuiper belt , through the centaur region , and into the inner solar system , an object does not necessarily preserve its albedo . whether this is just a bias in our sampling of differently - sized objects",
    " since we have not yet seen many centaur - sized , inner solar system , active comets  remains to be seen .",
    "however the effect may provide a clue to the mechanisms of cometary activity , since the phenomenon occurring on chiron does not appear to leave behind the same dark , mantled surface as we infer on the cometary nuclei .",
    "for example , an object that erupts in the centaur region may be exposing pristine ice and/or dust the surface with icy grains . this scenario would suggest that asbolus may still be sporadically active or only recently have entered a quiescent state .",
    "figure 2 compares albedo with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 colors .",
    "again the population is sparse but we note a general trend of redder objects having a lower albedo .",
    "this would be consistent with the idea that chemistry activated by cosmic ray irradiation effects surface darkening and reddening  if there were a mechanism to brighten the surface in the first place .",
    "for the centaurs , cometary activity could be that mechanism .",
    "impacts contribute to the effect as well but since most impactors are too small to cause widespread resurfacing , and since other color data now are inconsistent with the predicted manifestations , this can not be the dominant cause @xcite .",
    "the full explanation of the color diversity remains unknown , but in any case populating fig .",
    "2 with the albedos of more ordinary objects would be wise .",
    "table 2 gives a list of published radiometric estimates of chiron s radius ( with 1@xmath12 uncertainties ) and color temperature as a function of time and heliocentric distance .",
    "the average radius ( weighted by the variances ) is 82 km ; on the 2@xmath12 level all points are consistent .",
    "some of the variation on the positive side would normally be attributed to contamination from the infrared dust coma , but this would not mimic the long - term trend in activity seen at visible wavelengths @xcite . moreover a high color temperature is difficult to explain .",
    "grains much smaller than the wavelength of peak planck emission will appear to be hotter than expected but if that were the case with chiron one would also expect the comet to be intrinsically brighter ( and hence yield a larger effective radius ) , opposite to what is observed .",
    "a further constraint is the occultation result of @xcite , where the assumed - spherical chiron needs to have @xmath95 km . since rotational light curves",
    "imply that chiron is indeed only about 10% aspherical @xcite , this would imply a minimum effective radius of about 85 km .",
    "the reconciliation of the radiometry in table 2 ( and the occultation data ) may involve more detailed thermal modeling , as @xcite have done , but further observations are certainly necessary since none of the thermal measurements in the past 20 years have high signal - to - noise .",
    "thus it is possible that photometric uncertainty is corrupting our interpretation .",
    "lastly , we note that the albedo in eq . 4b is consistent with previous values @xcite",
    ". since our visible photometry is about 0.1 mag brighter than the faintest intrinsic measurements , as discussed in  3.3 , such a correction would reduce our albedo by 0.015 .",
    "@xcite report an albedo of @xmath96 using @xmath97 , which would make chiron about 0.3 mag intrinsically fainter than observed by @xcite in 1985 .",
    "a correction of that size would further reduce our albedo by 0.037 .",
    "thus all variation among reported albedos can be explained by the use of the different absolute magnitudes .",
    "\\1 . we have radiometrically determined the effective radii @xmath1 and geometric albedos @xmath0 of centaurs asbolus and chiron : @xmath98 @xmath99 the ranges effectively cover 2@xmath12 .    \\2 . under the stm formalism @xcite",
    ", we calculate an upper limit to asbolus thermal inertia is @xmath67 j",
    "m@xmath16 s@xmath68 k@xmath17 .",
    "this value is comparable to those of main belt asteroids , smaller than those of icy galilean satellites , and an order of magnitude smaller than the few values known for near - earth asteroids .",
    "@xcite find a comparable value for the @xmath54 of chiron .",
    "presumably the surfaces of chiron and asbolus are relatively porous and/or rough enough to inhibit heat flow .",
    "chiron s albedo is consistent with earlier measurements by others , taking into account the varying absolute magnitude , but others have noted a larger radius ( at the 2@xmath12 level ) . whether this is due to a varying infrared coma or simply the low signal - to - noise of all extant radiometric data remains to be seen .",
    "\\4 . of the four centaur albedos",
    "now known , two are comet - like and two are 2 to 3 times higher . during the dynamical cascade of objects from the kuiper belt and through the centaur region into the inner solar system ,",
    "the albedo is apparently not always preserved , although a more robust demonstration would require a comparison of similarly - sized objects .",
    "nevertheless , there is a greater diversity among the albedos of the centaurs than of the cometary nuclei .",
