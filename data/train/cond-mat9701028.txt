    "recently , there has been a lot of attention paid to the @xmath0 axis optical conductivity in the high @xmath2 cuprate superconductors . in particular",
    ", measurements of the optical conductivity in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco@xmath5 ) have revealed that the @xmath0 axis transport is very different in character from the electronic transport in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions ( within the layers).@xcite there is a great deal of speculation as to the source of this difference . at one end of the spectrum of thought",
    "there is the claim that the unusual @xmath0 axis transport is evidence for some non - fermi liquid like ground state within the cuo@xmath3 layers.@xcite at the other end of the spectrum , the claim is that the electronic ground state is metallic , but that there is some unconventional tunneling mechanism between the layers .",
    "the common feature to all of these models , however , is that they consider only a single copper oxide layer in each unit cell .    in the case of ybco@xmath5 , of course",
    ", the situation is not so simple .",
    "there are several layers between adjacent cuo@xmath3 layers , one of which ( the cuo chain layer ) is known to be conducting . in a previous paper@xcite we asked the question `` what is the effect of these intermediate layers , assuming a simple metallic model ? '' we considered a simple two - layer model in which each unit cell contained a cuo@xmath3 plane and a cuo chain , and we calculated the optical conductivity in the normal state .",
    "what we found was that , while making almost no assumptions about the band structure , we could explain many of the features seen in experiment  including the pseudogap seen in optical experiments .",
    "we claim that this work throws into doubt any attempt to interpret the @xmath0 axis conductivity that does not take into account the multilayered structure of the high @xmath2 materials .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the @xmath0 axis optical conductivity for a simple model of ybco@xmath5 in the superconducting state .",
    "this model is the same as the one described above : each unit cell contains a plane layer and a chain layer .",
    "these layers are evenly spaced and connected by coherent single - electron hopping .",
    "the amplitude for the hopping is parameterized by @xmath8 .",
    "the current model differs from our earlier one in two important ways .",
    "first , the sample is taken to be superconducting .",
    "based on experimental observations , we include a superconducting gap in both the plane and chain layers .",
    "@xcite second , the scattering rate @xmath9 is set to zero . in our study of the optical conductivity in the normal state ,",
    "the linear temperature dependence of the scattering rate was important at high temperatures . at low temperatures",
    "the scattering rate is small and can be ignored .",
    "one of the main conclusions of our earlier work is that , for small @xmath8 , interband processes play a dominant role in the @xmath0 axis conductivity . in isolation ,",
    "the plane and chain layers have dispersions @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "when the layers are coupled by @xmath8 , they hybridize and form two bands @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "electrons which travel along the @xmath0 axis in the presence of an external field may do so by either staying within the bands @xmath14 , or by making transitions between them .",
    "if the layer dispersions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nondegenerate , then the bands @xmath14 will differ from @xmath15 and @xmath16 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the interlayer spacing ( this follows from second order perturbation theory ) .",
    "the fermi velocities @xmath19 therefore scale as @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the matrix element for an interband transition is @xmath21 . for small @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath0 axis transport occurs preferentially through interband transitions .",
    "while the intraband conductivity has the well - known drude form , the interband conductivity does not .",
    "much of this paper will be devoted to understanding how the interband conductivity in the plane - chain model differs from the usual picture of conductivity in the superconducting state .",
    "we are aware of one other model which attempts to account for the presence of intermediate layers .",
    "the model , proposed by abrikosov,@xcite examines the effect of resonant tunneling through an impurity layer which lies between cuo@xmath3 layers . in the case of ybco@xmath5 ,",
    "the impurities are the oxygen vacancies in the cuo chain . with his model , he is able to provide a reasonable explanation of the @xmath0 axis d.c .  resistivity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , an equation for @xmath22 $ ] ( the optical conductivity along the @xmath0 axis ) is derived .",
    "the equation is integrated numerically and the results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] . a brief conclusion is contained in sec .  [ seciv ] .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian for our model is@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 creates an electron of spin @xmath26 and 3-dimensional momentum @xmath27 in the plane ( @xmath28 ) or chain ( @xmath29 ) sublattices .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath30 , \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the mean field superconducting order parameter , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the plane and chain dispersions respectively , and @xmath32 couples the plane and chain layers .",

    "the parameters are fixed at @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 .",
    "this is done by fitting the magnitudes of the penetration depth at @xmath40 ( which effectively measures the magnitudes of the fermi velocities @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) to experiment,@xcite while maintaining a fermi surface that looks qualitatively like that of band structure calculations.@xcite    the interlayer coupling is @xmath44 , which follows from a tight - binding model of @xmath0-axis coupling .",
    "the unit cell size is @xmath45 along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "again , by fitting @xmath46 to experiment , we have determined that @xmath47 mev for ybco@xmath48 and @xmath49 mev for ybco@xmath50 .",
    ".8    the fermi surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4a](a ) .",
    "the dashed lines give the fermi surface of the isolated chain and plane layers .",
    "these are also the fermi surfaces of @xmath14 at @xmath51 , since @xmath52 .",
    "the solid curves are the fermi surfaces at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a maximum . for intermediate values of @xmath55",
    ", the fermi surface lies between these two curves .",
    "the superconducting gap @xmath31 is chosen to be the same in both the plane and chain layers .",
    "it can have either a @xmath45-wave symmetry @xmath56,\\ ] ] or an @xmath57-wave symmetry @xmath58 in this work we do not propose a microscopic origin for the pairing interaction but rather assume that @xmath59 can be described phenomenologically by @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 k.    we have found , in previous work,@xcite that re @xmath1 $ ] in the normal state depends on the choice of parameters in two ways : @xmath63 depends qualitatively on whether or not the chain and plane fermi surfaces cross , and on the magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "we found that when the fermi surfaces do not cross , there is a direct gap which appears as a pseudogap of energy @xmath64 in @xmath63 .",
    "the pseudogap disappears at high @xmath65 because of the smearing of the quasiparticle energy by the large , temperature dependent , scattering rate .",
    "the temperature @xmath66 at which the pseudogap begins to be resolved is therefore determined by @xmath67 and there is no direct connection between the onset of superconductivity at @xmath2 and @xmath66 . as we mentioned before , the scattering is ignored in this work so the pseudogap is unchanged by temperature .",
    "we also found in our earlier work that for small values of @xmath8 the drude - like intraband contribution to the conductivity is hidden by the large interband conductivity .    in this work we will examine the @xmath0-axis optical response in the superconducting state .",
    "we will assume that the sample is in the clean limit .",
    "there is good evidence@xcite that the large , temperature dependent scattering rate does , in fact , drop dramatically below @xmath2 , although we have made this assumption primarily to keep the model simple . in this case",
    ", the drude part of @xmath63 collapses to a @xmath68-funtion at @xmath69 , and the only response at finite frequency comes from interband transitions . since the main effect of changing @xmath8 is to change the magnitude of the interband conductivity and not its form , we can arbitrarily fix @xmath70 mev .",
    "one of the most interesting features of our model hamiltonian is that the gap @xmath31 is the same in both the chain and plane layers .",
    "we have discussed the experimental evidence for this elsewhere.@xcite it is a somewhat surprising property since the chain layer does not have the tetragonal symmetry needed to generate a @xmath45-wave order parameter .",
    "this strongly suggests that the pairing interaction must originate in the ( tetragonal ) cuo@xmath3 plane layer , but then the difficulty lies in understanding the large magnitude of the gap on the chain layer .",
    "this has been discussed elsewhere by us,@xcite by xiang and wheatley@xcite and by odonovan and carbotte.@xcite    the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath71 give the band energies @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath14 are the normal state band energies @xmath77 ^ 2 + t^2}. \\label{13}\\ ] ]    the optical conductivity for a layered system is@xcite @xmath78 & = & \\frac{e^2 \\hbar}{2\\pi\\omega }   \\sum_{\\bf k } \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\ , \\mbox{tr } \\left [ \\hat{a}({\\bf k};x ) \\hat{\\gamma}_\\mu({\\bf k},{\\bf k } )   \\right .",

    "the probability for such transitions to occur , however , is strongly supressed by the probability that the lower energy band is initially occupied . at @xmath40 , the thermal factor",
    "@xmath113 ensures that the quasiparticle term vanishes .",
    "a second point we can make is that the pair creation term is gapped since the energy of pair creation @xmath114 has , in general , a nonzero minimum value .",
    "the lowest energy pairs which can be created can obviously be found by minimizing @xmath115 .",
    "for the case where the fermi surfaces cross , so that there is a line of @xmath27-values along which @xmath116 , the minimum energy is near @xmath117 .",
    "importantly , this shows that the pair creation term is gapped for a @xmath45-wave superconductor unless the fermi surfaces happen to cross at @xmath118 .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] is that the symmetry of the gap does not reveal itself in any obvious fashion .",
    "it is customary  within a drude model  to associate a gapped frequency dependence with an @xmath57-wave order parameter , and a gapless frequency dependence with a @xmath45-wave order parameter .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion , however , that this can not be done here . to summarize our discussion simply , the interband contribution to the conductivity  which is dominant at low temperatures  probes the structure of the energy sum @xmath119 and the energy difference @xmath120 , and not of the gap energy @xmath31 .",
    "this is in contrast , for example , with the single layer model in which the @xmath0 axis transport is through diffusive scattering.@xcite in this model the conductivity probes the density of states of a single layer.@xcite",
    "for layered superconductors , in which there are more than one type of layer , the @xmath0 axis conductivity is dominated by interband effects when the interlayer coupling is weak . in other words",
    ", it is easier for an electron to travel along the @xmath0 axis by making a series of interband transitions than by staying within a band .",
    "the intraband ( or drude ) and interband conductivities vary as @xmath91 and @xmath20 respectively .",
