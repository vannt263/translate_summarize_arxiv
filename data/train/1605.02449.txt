    "the family of organic charge transfer salts @xmath0-(et)@xmath5 , where et stands for the bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene molecule and @xmath6 is a monovalent cation , arouses interest for many years .",
    "indeed , its members can be classified in a very rich phase diagram including ground states ranging from mott insulator to superconductor @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 , which has been synthesized as early as 1988 @xcite , is on the metallic side of this phase diagram and is still one of the most studied organic superconductor . illustrating this long - standing interest , the existence of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov inhomogeneous superconducting state in this salt , considered more than 20 years ago for low dimensional conductors @xcite ,",
    "have received first experimental hints in the early 2000s @xcite and have been recently confirmed @xcite .    remarkably , the fermi surface of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 @xcite ( see fig .  [ d_tf ] ) is the first experimental realization of the model fermi surface proposed by pippard in the early sixties to compute the effect of magnetic breakdown ( mb ) in multiband metals @xcite .",
    "both shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) @xcite and de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) @xcite oscillations have been widely studied in this compound . provided the magnetic field strength is high enough to overcome the mb gap between the @xmath2 orbit and the quasi one - dimensional sheets , linear combinations of the frequencies linked to the @xmath2 and mb - induced @xmath3 orbits are observed in the oscillatory spectrum ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) , as expected in the framework of the coupled orbits network model of falicov - stachowiak @xcite . within this model",
    ", the frequency @xmath7 of any fourier component can be expressed as @xmath7 = @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an integer and @xmath10 is the frequency linked to the @xmath11 orbit . with the exception of quantum interference ( qi ) , which only holds for magnetoresistance , and",
    "for which the effective mass is the difference between the partial effective mass of each qi path @xcite , the effective mass @xmath12 is given by @xmath12 = @xmath13 .",
    "however , limiting ourselves to dhva data , the field and temperature dependence of few of the observed fourier components does not behave consistently with this model .",
    "for example , the effective masses linked to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , determined in the framework of the lifshitz - kosevich model @xcite , are strongly different from 2@xmath16 and 2@xmath17 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , puzzling data are reported regarding the component @xmath3 + @xmath2 which corresponds to a mb orbit .",
    "indeed , even though according to @xcite @xmath18 is equal to @xmath17+@xmath16 within the error bars , in agreement with the falicov - stachowiak model , this relation can not account for the data of @xcite for which @xmath18 is definitely smaller than the sum @xmath19 ( see @xcite for a discussion of this feature ) .",
    "in addition to all this , the most striking discrepancy between the falicov - stachowiak model and the dhva data ( for which qi is not relevant since dhva is only sensitive to the density of states ) is the presence of the fourier components @xmath4 and 2(@xmath4 ) , known as ` forbidden frequencies ' which can not correspond to closed orbits ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "these features have been addressed in the case of @xmath20-phase salts belonging to the family @xmath20-(et)@xmath21mbr@xmath21(c@xmath22h@xmath21cl@xmath1 ) for m = co , zn @xcite which share with @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 the same fermi surface topology .",
    "briefly , the strong two - dimensionality of these compounds is responsible for a significant oscillation of the chemical potential in magnetic field which requires a calculation of the free energy ( canonical ensemble ) up to the second - order in damping factors . in few cases ,",
    "the first order term of the oscillatory magnetization , which corresponds to the usual lifshitz - kosevich formula @xcite , may have a smaller contribution to the amplitude of the fourier components linked to mb orbits than the second order term .",
    "moreover , the second order term solely accounts for the ` forbidden frequencies ' . a very good quantitative agreement between these calculations and the reported dhva data",
    "is observed .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out in @xcite , data analysis relevant to other salts , with different physical parameters , such as effective masses , mb field , @xmath23 , are required .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is to report on dhva data of @xmath0-(et)@xmath1cu(scn)@xmath1 at high magnetic field .",
    "it is confirmed that the usual lifshitz - kosevich formalism can not account for few of the fourier component amplitudes such as 2@xmath2 and , obviously , @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , it is demonstrated that the above mentioned second order development holds for all the observed fourier components .",
    "the studied crystal , with approximate dimensions 0.1 @xmath24 0.1 @xmath24 0.04 mm@xmath25 , was synthesized by electrocrystallization technique .",
    "magnetic torque measurements were performed in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 55 t with pulse decay duration of 0.36 s , in the temperature range from 1.7 k to 4.2 k. the angle between the magnetic field direction and the normal to the conducting plane was @xmath20 = 20@xmath26 .",
    "[ d_tf](a ) displays magnetic torque data at 1.7 k. as expected , a strong hysteresis is observed in the superconducting state at low field due to flow of magnetic flux either into or out of the crystal as the field either increases or decreases @xcite . in contrast , data for up and down fields are indiscernible from each other in the range where oscillations are observed .",
    "this result indicates that any temperature change due to eventual eddy currents is negligible .",
    "in addition , torque interaction effect might have been considered since , due to magnetic torque , @xmath20 angle is liable to change during the field sweep for small cantilever stiffness and ( or ) high @xmath20 value @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath20 changes are always smaller than 0.1@xmath27 , leading to negligibly small amplitude and frequency changes of at most 0.2 @xmath28 at the highest fields explored . in the following",
    ", only data recorded during the decreasing part of the field is therefore considered .",
    "analysis of the oscillatory part of the magnetic torque is based on discrete fourier transforms of the data , after substraction of a smoothly varying background , calculated with a blackman window .",
    "the high field range of the oscillatory part of the torque data is displayed in fig .",
    "[ d_tf](a ) .",
    "as expected , corresponding fourier analysis reveals several components , of which the frequencies are linear combinations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "owing to the tilt angle @xmath20= 20@xmath26 , these frequencies are @xmath31 = 0.600(1 ) kt and @xmath32 = 3.861(7 ) kt . these values are in good agreement with the data of the literature @xcite in which values in the range @xmath31 = 0.596(2)-0.670(4 ) kt and @xmath32 = 3.8 - 3.923(9 ) kt are reported .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 orbit area amounts to 16 % of the first brillouin zone area , in agreement with both previous experimental data and band structure calculations @xcite .    according to the calculations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude of the basic @xmath2 and @xmath3 fourier components , up to second order in damping factors , is accounted for by :    @xmath33\\ ] ]    and    @xmath34,\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "damping factors can be expressed as @xmath35 = @xmath36 , where @xmath37 stands either for @xmath2 or @xmath3 and @xmath38 is the harmonic number .",
    "for a two - dimensional fermi surface , the thermal , dingle , mb and spin damping factors are expressed as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the parameter ( @xmath43 ) and the constant ( @xmath44 ) are expressed as @xmath43 = @xmath45 and @xmath44 = 2@xmath46 = 14.694 t / k .",
    "@xmath47 is the dingle temperature defined by @xmath48 = @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the scattering rate . @xmath12 and @xmath51 are the effective mass ( in @xmath52 units ) and effective land factor , respectively .",
    "the mb damping factor involves the number of tunnelings ( @xmath53 ) and reflections ( @xmath54 ) encountered by a quasiparticle traveling the orbit .",
    "the corresponding probabilities , @xmath55 and @xmath56=@xmath57 , respectively , are given by the chambers formula which involve the magnetic breakdown field @xmath58 : @xmath59 = @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the first order term of these equations just corresponds to the lifshitz - kosevich formula . besides , provided that the spin damping factors @xmath61 are not too small ( i.e. @xmath62 is not close to an odd integer ) , the second order term is negligible @xcite .",
    "this point , which can be checked @xmath63 , allows us to perform the data analysis relevant to @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the framework of lifshitz - kosevich formula . nevertheless ,",
    "even though the spin damping factors act as constant prefactors in this case , 5 parameters are still involved , namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath58 .",
    "for this reason , it is assumed in the following that the dingle temperature is the same for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbits ( @xmath64=@xmath65=@xmath66 ) .",
    "finally , it must be kept in mind that the magnetic torque amplitudes @xmath67 are related to the dhva amplitude by @xmath67 = @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a prefactor depending on the crystal mass , cantilever stiffness and tilt angle @xmath20 .",

    "@xcite , @xmath17/@xmath16 = 2 within the error bars .",
    "it can be noticed that the mb field @xmath58 is obtained with a large uncertainty .",
    "this feature , can be explained considering that , in addition to an increase of the dingle plot slope relevant to the @xmath3 orbit , the main discernible effect of mb is to induce a curvature in the field dependence of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "however , this curvature remains small in the explored field range which yields a large uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty is reflected in the strong scattering of the previously reported experimental data which yield @xmath58 values ( themselves with large uncertainties ) in the range from 15 t to 45 t @xcite .",
    "data relevant to frequency combinations are reported in fig .",
