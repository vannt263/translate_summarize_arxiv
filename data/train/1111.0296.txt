    "variations in the initial slope , @xmath12 , do not affect the final slope value , although the high mass end evolves differently or reaches equilibrium at different timescales .",

    "variations in the gravity - dominated regime of the curve ( @xmath32 and @xmath36 ) do not have significant effects on the equilibrium dust - mass distribution , so we do not consider these parameters further .",
    "the tensile strength curve has been extensively studied for decades . however , as it is dependent on various material properties and the collisional velocity @xcite , its parameters do not have universally applicable values .",
    "determining the tensile strength curve at large and small sizes is also extremely difficult experimentally .",
    "the slope @xmath35 of the strength curve in the strength - dominated regime depends on the weibull flaw - size distribution .",
    "its measured values range anywhere between -0.7 and -0.3 @xcite .",
    "steeper values of @xmath35 make smaller materials harder to disrupt , which results in a steeper dust distribution slope . at @xmath61 ,",
    "the smallest particles are hard enough to resist catastrophic disruption even when the projectile mass equals the target mass .",
    "this results in a mass distribution with a slope equal to the redistribution slope @xmath62 at the smallest scales , while in the fitted region it is significantly steeper . at @xmath63 ,",
    "the smallest particles are still able to destroy each other and generate a dust distribution slope that is close to 1.91 .",
    "the scaling constants of the tensile strength curve are the dominant parameters in the evolution toward the quasi steady - state distribution .",
    "when reducing the complete tensile strength curve scaling @xmath28 , wave structures form more easily , as a particle becomes capable of affecting the evolution of particles much larger than itself ( see paper i ) . when upscaling the tensile strength curve , the quasi steady - state distribution slope starts to resemble the redistribution slope , as it is the particle redistributions that lead the evolution of the particle mass distribution . when varying the scaling of only the strength side of the curve @xmath30 , similar effects can be seen .",
    "we have shown that drastic offsets in the collision parameter values result in slight changes to the quasi steady state mass distribution slope .",
    "we conclude that , for all reasonable values of the collisional parameters , the quasi steady - state dust - mass distribution slope is larger or equal to @xmath64 .",
    "there are a number of parameters that can change from one collisional system to another : the material density @xmath4 , the minimum and the maximum particle mass in the system @xmath6 and @xmath8 , the radial distance @xmath13 , height @xmath15 , and width @xmath14 of the disk , and the spectral type of the central star .",
    "all these parameters affect three properties of the collisional model : the blow - out mass , the collisional velocity , and the number density of particles .",
    "varying these parameters will change the timescale of the evolution and affect the quasi steady - state distribution slope . in this subsection ,",
    "we analyze the effects of varying the radial distance on the equilibrium mass distribution through the dependence of the collisional velocity on radius . modifying either disk parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 or the spectral - type of the star would have similar effects .",

    ", we show the effects of varying the radial distance , @xmath13 , on the mass distribution evolved to 10 gyr . decreasing",
    "the radial distance will increase the collisional velocity , resulting in the appearance of waves at the small - mass end of the distribution .",
    "it also generates a much more pronounced kink at the high mass end . on the other hand , when the velocity is decreased at large radii ,",
    "the low mass end of the distribution starts resembling the redistribution function , as smaller particles are not destroyed due to the lower energy collisions .",
    "moreover , no kink is produced at the high mass end . in the right panel of",
    ", we show the evolution of the particle - mass distribution slope as a function of the collisional velocity .",
    "for high velocity collisions , the waves render the fitting of a single mass distribution slope ill constructed but the underlying slope of the wavy mass distribution is slightly steeper than for the smaller collisional velocity case .",
    "we discuss here the effects of three non - physical variables that appear in the numerical algorithm .",
    "they are : the mass ratio @xmath37 between neighboring grid points and the parameters of the large particle collisional cross - section smoothing formula , @xmath38 and @xmath65 ( see paper i ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : delta ] , we plot the distribution of the model with varying values of @xmath37 at 10 gyr ( left panel ) and the evolution in the slope of the dust distribution ( right panel ) .",
    "the evolution of the dust distribution is affected by the number of grid points we use , converging at @xmath66 ; this corresponds to 801 grid points between our @xmath6 and @xmath8 mass range . using a lower number of grid points leads to errors in the numerical integration for the redistribution , leading to an offset larger than 7% for the smallest particles in the system , when only using half as many grid points .",
    "we find that the dust distribution slope is practically independent of the smoothing variables @xmath38 and @xmath65 .      in our model calculations ,",
    "the dust distributions in the vast majority of cases reach quasi steady - state by and only in a few cases do they take somewhat longer .",
    "the characteristic time is less than 100 myr for all realistic cases in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this shows that , apart from second generation debris disks , the majority of debris disks around stars of ages over 100 myr are most likely to be in collisional quasi steady - state , at least for the smallest particles ( @xmath67 )",
    ". however , young and extended systems , such as @xmath68 pic @xcite , might not be near quasi steady - state at the outer parts of their disks , where interaction timescales are longer .",
    "one of the most surprising results of the wide range of numerical models we computed is the robustness of the quasi steady - state distribution .",
    "varying the values of the model parameters does not result in significant changes in the slope of the distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig : errs ] , we show the effect on the equilibrium slope of the dust - mass distribution function of varying each model parameter .",
    "we order the parameters on the horizontal axis as a function of decreasing magnitude of their effects .",
    "parameters that had to be varied by many orders of magnitude to have effects on the equilibrium slope are analyzed in log space .",
    "the plot shows that the dominant parameter , by far , is the slope of the strength curve in the strength - dominated regime .",
    "this is followed by variables that affect the collisional velocity ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and the power @xmath21 of the erosive cratered mass formula ( equation [ [ eq : mcr ] ] ) .",
    "the plot also shows that neither of our arbitrarily chosen collision prescription constants have any significant effects on the outcome of the collisional cascade .",
    "the model runs predict an equilibrium dust mass distribution slope of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , taking the maximum offsets originating from the 50% variation in the model parameters test as our error .",
    "due to the complexity of full numerical models and the varying amount of structures in the particle mass - distributions presented in the papers detailing them , it is still common practice for debris disk seds to be calculated and fitted to observed data assuming a simple power - law for the mass - distribution of particles .",
    "the applicability of a power - law distribution has never been probed systematically .",
    "another issue within this simplification is that the value for the slope of the power - law used is generally the traditional 11/6 ( or 3.5 in size space ) determined by @xcite , although this has already been proven to be only valid for the constant material tensile strength case by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we have shown in the preceding sections , a steeper distribution function of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is a more likely outcome when considering realistic conditions .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite and @xcite , among others .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate the extent to which a simple power - law is a valid approximation for the mass distribution in debris disks . as we are evaluating the detectability of effects of deviations from a power - law mass distribution on the generated seds , we are only concerned with particles smaller than @xmath71 in size .",
    "deviations from a power - law on this scale occur when waves appear superposed on the distribution itself , meaning the conditions that result in the formation of waves in the particle mass - distribution need to be studied .",
    "waves appear superposed on the mass - distribution due to the discontinuity at the low - mass cut - off .",
    "this behavior has been explained before as a result of the build - up of particles at the boundary @xcite , however examining the properties of the collisional equation ( see paper i ) yields a different picture . in figure",

    "it is apparent that for these masses the peaks of the removal integrands are located exactly at the cut - off .",

    "we also note that the additive peaks of the minimum ( cut - off ) mass , shown with red solid curves , are not correlated with the location of the dip in the distribution ( marked with a black solid tick mark ) , but shift as a function of the collision velocity . at higher collisional velocity , where waves are stronger , the largest number of cut - off particles are actually produced by the particles in the dip , which would provide a negative feedback according to the traditional picture , canceling the waves .",

    "a common issue with all of these analytic solutions is that they assume a steady state system , meaning that the mass flux through mass @xmath75 is zero [ @xmath110 . in reality , without mass input at the high mass end the systems lose mass and decay , meaning the mass flux is never zero in a system , but rather is a time and mass dependent variable .",
    "the solution of the cascade is actually an eigenvalue problem , which is difficult to solve analytically .",
    "our numerical code allows investigating the quasi steady state [ @xmath111 solution of collisional cascades , without the aforementioned simplifications . in figure",
    "[ fig : seta ] , we compare the @xcite and @xcite steady state mass distribution slope results with the ones given by our code at varying values of tensile strength slope . at @xmath112 ( constant @xmath113 )",
    "the @xcite solution is equal to the traditional @xcite value , but it gives steeper mass - distribution slopes for lower values of @xmath35 .",
    "similar behavior is seen with our code ; however , at @xmath112 our prediction for the quasi steady state slope is @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , which is still steeper than the traditional value . at much lower values of @xmath35 ( @xmath116 )",
    "we predict a mass distribution slope that is less steep than the ones given by the @xcite formula , while our results intersect at @xmath117 , yielding a quasi steady state slope of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "since the point of this intersection is close to the theoretical and experimental value of the tensile strength curve slope , the predictions from a pure steady state model and a quasi steady state model will agree within errors .",
    "this renders the testing of different models difficult .",
    "however , our numerical calculations provide a general new estimate for the particle size distribution slopes with significantly more complete physics compared to previous analytic approaches .",

    "it is customary to express the flux density as a function of wavelength , we rewrite this also as @xmath124    .",

    "the exact function of the absorption efficiencies of particles in the interstellar medium or in circumstellar disks is largely unknown .",
    "the most commonly used particle types for sed calculations are artificial astronomical silicate ( the properties of which are adjusted to reproduce the typical 10 @xmath126 silicate feature and measured laboratory dielectric functions ) and graphite @xcite . in , we plot the absorption efficiency as a function of wavelength for a few astronomical silicate particle sizes .",
    "particles larger than @xmath99 have nearly constant absorption efficiency curves at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath127 , where @xmath2 is the particle radius ) with @xmath128 , which is followed by a power - law cut off .",

    "the minimum particle size cut - off was set at @xmath133 , in accordance with our model ( see paper i ) .",
    "all disks with radial distances below @xmath134 have a common slope for wavelengths larger than @xmath135 , and the furthest disk at @xmath132 joins this common slope around @xmath136 .",
    "the blow - out size in a system depends on grain structure ( porosity ) and the exact value of the optical constants for small grains ( which is largely unknown and is a function of grain material ) . for this reason",

    "the offsets between the seds become apparent for wavelengths shorter than @xmath139 , while for longer wavelengths , the emission profiles agree and have a common pseudo rayleigh - jeans slope .    finally , we explore the dependence of the sed on the slope of the quasi steady - state particle - mass distribution .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : synth ] shows synthetic seds generated for a debris ring at 25 au around an a0 spectral type star , with a minimum particle cut - off size at @xmath140 , but with particle mass distribution slopes between 1.81 and 1.99 .",
    "these plots show that the slope of the rayleigh - jeans part of the emission is greatly influenced by the particle size distribution slope .",
    "in fact , it depends almost solely on this slope , with the temperature of the grains having mild effects at large orbital distances .",
    "we also performed our tests with dirty - ice optical constants @xcite and found very similar results , showing that our results are also independent on particle types assumed .",
    "the absorption efficiency curves can be simplified and described as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a scaling constant for the power - law part of the function .",
    "fitting the silicate absorption efficiency functions , we find @xmath143 using this simplified absorption efficiency model and assuming that all particles contribute to the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sed with their own rayleigh - jeans emission , we estimate the emitted flux density at long wavelengths as @xmath144\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assumed a @xmath68 parameter that is independent of the particle size . the variable @xmath145 is the number density scaling ( see paper i ) , @xmath146 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath147 is the temperature of the dust grains ( which we also assume to be particle size independent ) , and @xmath148 is the distance of the system from the observer .",
    "the quantity @xmath149 is the quasi steady - state particle size distribution slope , and can be calculated from the mass distribution slope as @xmath150 . integrating these functions , we get @xmath151 where @xmath152 assuming @xmath130 , which is appropriate for astronomical silicates , we find that the slope of the sed is equal to @xmath153 for the short wavelength part of the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sed and @xmath154 for the long wavelength regime , where @xmath155 for the particles contributing the most to the emission .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite .",
    "this behavior explains why the slope of the flux density in the long wavelength regime is not dependent on the optical properties of the grains , as @xmath155 for all grain types at these wavelengths that effectively contribute to it .",
    "our models yield a quasi steady - state distribution slope of @xmath156 , meaning that the rayleigh - jeans tail end of the seds should be proportional to @xmath157 as long as the particles are in collisional quasi steady - state .",
