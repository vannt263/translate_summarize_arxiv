    "the detection of strong maser emission at the frequencies of pure rotational transitions of some molecules is a common phenomenon in circumstellar envelopes ( cse s ) of evolved stars @xcite .",
    "the maser is usually produced in a small region of the envelope and sometimes provides valuable information on the physical conditions of the emitting region .    due to the different chemistry",
    ", masers are produced by different molecules in o- and c - rich stars . in o - rich stars ,",
    "sio exhibits strong maser emission in different rotational transitions within several vibrational states , from @xmath1=1 to 4 @xcite .",
    "these masers are formed in a region of the cse very close to the stellar surface and seem to be driven by nir radiation @xcite . in c - rich stars , although sio is present with similar abundances than in o - rich stars @xcite , no sio maser has been detected .",
    "the explanation could be that sio is formed at @xmath23 - 5  r@xmath3 , where the angular dilution of the star is high and the density and temperature lower than in the regions where sio masers are produced in o - rich stars @xcite . in c - rich stars only hcn shows strong maser emission in several pure rotational lines within vibrational states from @xmath7=1 to 4 @xcite .",
    "these masers must be formed in the innermost regions of the cse .",
    "sis has been previously found to show weak maser emission in the @xmath0=1 - 0 @xmath1=0 transition in irc+10216 @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the first detection of maser emission from the @xmath0=11 - 10 , 14 - 13 and 15 - 14 transitions in the @xmath1=0 vibrational state of sis ( hereafter m@xmath8 , m@xmath5 , and m@xmath9 ) observed toward the c - rich star irc+10216 .",
    "we have also obtained observations of @xmath1=1 rotational lines which exhibit thermal emission .",
    "we propose that overlaps of @xmath1=1 - 0 ro - vibrational transitions of sis with mid - ir lines of c@xmath5h@xmath5 and hcn could provide the pumping mechanism for these masers as well as higher-@xmath0 @xmath1=0 sis masers in the submillimeter range .",
    "this discovery is interesting because this species could play in c - rich stars a role similar to that of sio in o - rich stars : the energy level pattern of both molecules is similar and it is also formed close to the star , as chemical equilibrium and interferometric observations imply @xcite .",
    "the observations of the @xmath1=0 @xmath0=6 - 5 and @xmath0=8 - 7 to @xmath0=15 - 14 transitions of sis ( see left panels , fig .  [",
    "fig : figure ] ) were carried out on 2004 june 19@xmath10 with the iram 30 m radio telescope .",
    "four sis receivers operating at 1 , 1.3 , 2 , and 3  mm were used simultaneously .",
    "system temperatures were in the range 120 - 225  k for the 1 , 1.3 and 2  mm receivers and 200 - 600  k for the 1  mm receivers .",
    "atmospheric opacities ranged between 0.08 at 108  ghz to 0.28 at 267  ghz . for the @xmath0=10 - 9 sis line at 181.5  ghz ,",
    "the system temperature was significantly higher , @xmath210@xmath11  k , due to proximity to the atmospheric water line at 183.3  ghz .",
    "the intensity scale was calibrated using two absorbers at different temperatures according to the atmosphere transmission model atm @xcite . pointing and focus were regularly checked on the nearby quasar oj 287 .",
    "the observations were made in wobbling mode , with 180  offset and the secondary nutating at a rate of 0.5  hz . the backends were a filter bank with 256  mhz bandwidth and 1  mhz resolution and an autocorrelator with 80  khz resolution ( @xmath12@xmath1@xmath20.08@xmath130.2  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the lines of sis in the @xmath1=1 state ( see right panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure ] ) were also observed with the iram 30  m telescope between 1989 and 2001 .",
    "additionally we show some spectra corresponding to ro - vibrational lines of sis ( see center panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure ] ) from a mid - ir high resolution spectrum ( 11 - 14  @xmath14 m ) obtained in 2002 december with the texes spectrometer mounted on the 3  m telescope irtf ( observational procedures described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath1=1 rotational lines show single cusped profiles and their relative intensities indicate that the rotational levels are thermally populated .",
    "the linewidths correspond to velocities of 9 - 11  km  s@xmath4 , lower than the terminal velocity @xmath214.5  km  s@xmath4 @xcite , thus the emission arises from the innermost region of the cse , between the photosphere and the inner dust formation zone , placed at @xmath25  r@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we can derive the sis abundance in that region from the @xmath1=1 lines assuming an uniform sphere at a distance of 180 pc with a radius of 10 r@xmath3 , illuminated by the central star ( r@xmath3=5@xmath1510@xmath6 cm , t@xmath3=2300  k ) , with t@xmath16=1000  k and n@xmath17=1.6@xmath1510@xmath18  @xmath19 ( mean values for this region derived by @xcite ) and an expansion velocity of 11  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we solve the statistical equilibrium for sis considering 100 rotational levels and 3 vibrational states and apply the lvg radiative transfer formalism using the code developed by j. cernicharo . with the assumed n@xmath17 ,",
    "the column density for h@xmath5 is @xmath27@xmath1510@xmath20  @xmath21 and the derived one for sis is @xmath25.0@xmath1510@xmath22  @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the sis abundance is @xmath27@xmath1510@xmath23 .",
    "this result is compatible with a higher sis abundance in the innermost cse ( from lte chemistry models , 3@xmath1510@xmath24 , @xcite ) and an abundance further away of 6.5@xmath15@xmath25 according to observations of @xmath1=0 rotational lines over the outer cse by @xcite .",
    "most @xmath1=0 rotational lines show a rounded or slightly double peaked profile with the blue part absorbed by cold sis through the envelope .",
    "however , m@xmath8 , m@xmath5 and m@xmath9 show extra emission in the form of narrow peaks ( fwhm=1 - 3  km s@xmath4 ) . the velocities of these features , within the @xmath26 to 10  km s@xmath4 range , indicate that sis maser emission arises from different regions located between the star and the inner dust formation zone ( @xmath27@xmath25  r@xmath3 ) .",
    "the lines m@xmath5 and m@xmath9 have been previously observed by @xcite but no maser emission was noticed .",
    "this could be due either to the limited sensitivity of their observations or to a time variability of the sis maser phenomenon .",
    "the bottom - center panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure ] shows in detail the line profiles of the observed masers .",
    "up to ten maser features labelled ( @xmath28,  ,@xmath29 ) are identified .",
    "the most complex line profile is that of m@xmath9 .",
    "it is formed by 5 main features : @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath29 with @xmath1=@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37  km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the line profiles show that the strongest peaks are at negative velocities , having their red counterparts rather weak .",
    "this behavior was previously found by @xcite for the @xmath1=0 @xmath0=1 - 0 line , which mostly consists of a narrow peak ( fwhm=0.3  km  s@xmath4 ) centered at @xmath38  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the strong asymmetry of the lineshapes can be either due to blanking by the star of the redshifted maser or by amplification of the blueshifted emission by the foreground stellar environment .",
    "the strongest observed maser , m@xmath9 , with t@xmath39@xmath260  k ( f@xmath40@xmath2300  jy ; with thermal and non - thermal emission ) , is weak compared to some sio masers detected in o - rich stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or to hcn masers observed in irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "however , m@xmath8 , m@xmath5 , and m@xmath9 are stronger than the sis @xmath0=1 - 0 maser observed towards irc+10216 by @xcite .",
    "the similarity between maser features in m@xmath5 and m@xmath9 indicates that they may arise from the same regions and produced by the same pumping mechanism ; the maser in m@xmath8 is probably formed in other regions .",
    "hence , we suggest two possible geometries of the innermost cse to explain the observed features :    ( @xmath32 ) an onion - like innermost region , where each maser is produced in a shell .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the symmetry of features @xmath28@xmath29 and @xmath30@xmath32 .",
    "the peaks at extreme velocities , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , would be produced just in front of and behind the star near the inner dust formation shell ( @xmath27@xmath25  r@xmath3 ) with expansion velocities of @xmath25 - 11  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the features @xmath30 and @xmath32 would be produced in a similar way but in an inner shell with a lower expansion velocity .",
    "finally , the central peak , @xmath31 , would be formed in a shell very close to the star , with the whole shell contributing to the maser emission .",
    "m@xmath8 would be produced in a cap - shaped region in front of the star .",
    "( @xmath41 ) all the masers are formed in different positions of a clumpy shell .",
    "the different features in m@xmath5 and m@xmath9 would be produced in different regions of the shell : peaks @xmath28 and @xmath29 in front of and behind the star and the other peaks ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) in different clumps , as occur with the only feature of m@xmath8 .",
    "the classic pumping mechanism for the sio @xmath1@xmath420 masers observed in o - rich stars resides in the increase of the trapping lifetime ( a/@xmath43)@xmath44 with @xmath0 for @xmath1@xmath45@xmath1 - 1 transitions , when they become optically thick @xcite .",
    "such mechanism produces masers in adjacent rotational lines of the @xmath1 state , and explains the @xmath1=1 and 2 sio masers @xcite .",
    "however , the masers observed in rotational transitions of @xmath46sio , @xmath47sio , and in @xmath1=3 and 4 of sio do not show the latter behavior and have been interpreted as due to ir overlaps between ro - vibrational lines of sio isotopologues @xcite . for sis ,",
    "the absence of maser emission in @xmath1=1 rotational lines and the odd @xmath1=0 pattern also exclude the kwan & scoville pumping mechanism .",
    "this suggests that overlaps of @xmath1=1 - 0 ro - vibrational transitions of sis with those of mode @xmath48 of c@xmath5h@xmath5 and mode @xmath7 of hcn , could provide the pumping mechanism .",
    "c@xmath5h@xmath5 and hcn are abundant in the inner cse of irc+10216 and dominate the 11 - 14 @xmath14 m spectrum @xcite .",
    "overlaps with these two species have been already proposed by @xcite to explain the different profiles of adjacent @xmath0 lines of sis . however , the sis frequencies used in that work were not as accurate ( @xmath49@xmath5010@xmath4  cm@xmath4 ) as those available today .",
    "we have calculated those frequencies from the dunham coefficients determined by @xcite , for which the error of the band center is @xmath52@xmath53  cm@xmath4 ( @xmath20.04  km  s@xmath4 ; the relative accuracy of p and r lines is much better ) .",
    "the frequencies of c@xmath5h@xmath5 , h@xmath6cch , hcn , and h@xmath6cn lines have been taken from the hitran database 2004 @xcite , with an accuracy better than @xmath54 cm@xmath4 ( @xmath20.4  km  s@xmath4 ) for c@xmath5h@xmath5 and h@xmath6cch , and @xmath53  cm@xmath4 for hcn and h@xmath6cn .",
    "table  [ tab : frequencies_sis ] shows the mid - ir line overlaps of sis with c@xmath5h@xmath5 , hcn , and their most abundant isotopologues . for the overlap search we selected coincidences within @xmath55@xmath5210  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "however , since the cse is expanding , every region of the envelope is receding from the others . hence",
    ", if the population of the sis levels is affected by an overlap with a strong line of other species , the frequency of this overlapping transition must be higher than the sis one .",
    "this would restrict the condition to positive @xmath56 . nevertheless , due to the linewidth , lines at @xmath56@xmath520 can overlap the sis lines .",
    "hence , we have set the negative cutoff to one half of the typical linewidth in the innermost cse ( @xmath25  km  s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our search is restricted to @xmath57  km  s@xmath4 .",

    "some of them are shown in the second block of table  [ tab : frequencies_sis ] .",
