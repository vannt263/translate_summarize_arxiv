    "type  iin supernovae ( sne  iin ) are a class of supernovae ( sne ) that show prominent narrow h emission lines in their optical spectra @xcite .",
    "there is a general consensus that these sne occur in dense circumstellar media ( csm ) created by pre - sn mass losses , and that the narrow h lines are produced by photoionization of the dense winds irradiated by x - rays from the region behind the forward shock .",
    "however , the detailed nature of sne  iin is still unclear , because well - studied objects are sparse ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "in particular , their progenitors have not yet been established .",
    "one of the most important quantities to constrain the progenitor is a mass - loss rate , which varies from @xmath010@xmath1310@xmath14yr@xmath6 for red supergiants ( rsg ) , @xmath010@xmath1510@xmath16yr@xmath6 for stripped wolf - rayet stars , and to @xmath010@xmath1710@xmath9yr@xmath6 for luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars @xcite .",
    "we can infer mass - loss rates of progenitor stars by measuring h@xmath18 and x - rays from sne , since they arise due to interactions between the csm and ejecta .",
    "so far , mass - loss rates have been inferred for several sne  iin . the values scatter within 10@xmath1710@xmath9yr@xmath6 , consistent with massive eruptions seen for lbv stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , possible detections of lbv - like progenitors in pre - sn images were reported for sne  2005gl and 2009ip @xcite .    sn  2005ip , discovered on 2005",
    "november 5.163 in the nearby galaxy ngc  2906 @xcite , was initially designated a normal type  ii sn , based on an optical spectrum taken 1 day after discovery @xcite .",
    "but later , @xcite found clear narrow h@xmath18 emission even on day  1 as well as an unusually rich forest of narrow coronal lines at later times , and categorized sn  2005ip as sne  iin .",
    "@xcite reported strong ir emission over more than 900 days post discovery .",
    "subsequent studies on ir photometric and spectroscopic observations showed two dust components , one presumably formed in the ejecta or cool dense shell and the other pre - existing dust in the surrounding csm @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from sn  2005ip was detected on 2007 november with _",
    "for an assumed foreground column density of @xmath19 = 3.7@xmath20@xmath3 and a thermal spectrum with a plasma temperature of @xmath21 1kev , an absorption - corrected ( or intrinsic ) x - ray luminosity was calculated to be 1.6@xmath22ergs@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "previous optical and ir observations have led to different estimates of mass - loss rates for the progenitor of sn  2005ip . from the h@xmath18 intensity together with the cs wind speed ( @xmath23kms@xmath6 ) , @xcite inferred that @xmath24 ( 24)@xmath25@xmath9yr@xmath6 and argued that the progenitor is a rsg star having eruptive mass ejections like vy canis majoris @xcite .",
    "by contrast , a large amount of warm dust contained in the cs shell led @xcite to suggest a very high mass - loss rate of 0.0750.38@xmath9yr@xmath6 .",
    "such a mass - loss rate exclusively favors a lbv - like progenitor rather than a rsg .",
    "most recently , @xcite estimated that @xmath24 ( 1.21.4)@xmath26@xmath9yr@xmath6 , based on analytical modeling of the bolometric light curve .",
    "this result further supports a lbv - like progenitor .    in this paper",

    "the spectral evolution can be best interpreted by a significant decline of absorption due to the external csm .",
    "the x - ray spectra enable us to measure a correct x - ray luminosty as well as an absorbing column density , allowing for a new estimate of the mass - loss rate , independent of the other previous ones . throughout this paper",
    ", we use a distance to sn  2005ip of 35mpc @xcite , and adopt 2005 october 27.2 ( 9 days prior to the discovery ) as the time of explosion @xcite .",
    "we analyze several archival _ swift _ and _ chandra _ data for sn  2005ip using the heasoft and ciao packages .",
    "detailed information of these observations is summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we combine the latest five _ swift _ observations taken in 2012 march into one data file owing to the poor photon statistics for individual data sets . as a result , we have five observation epochs , i.e. , 2007 february ( _ swift _ ) , 2008 june ( _ chandra _ ) , 2008 november ( _ swift _ ) , 2009 november ( _ swift _ ) , and 2012 march ( _ swift _ ) .",

    "the background levels to the source are quite small : @xmath00.3% ( _ chandra _ ) and @xmath03% ( _ swift _ ) . each spectrum is grouped into bins , so that each bin contains at least 5 counts .",
    "we have checked that even if we set the number of the minimum grouping count to be unity , we obtain the same fit results shown below .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "clearly , the spectra are softening with time , as is evident in hardness ratios summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .    for spectral modeling",

    ". we allow the absorbing h column density ( @xmath19 ) , the temperature ( @xmath28 ) , and normalizations to be free , while we treat the temperature to be common among all the five spectra in order to better constrain the parameters .",
    "elemental abundances in both tbabs and apec models are set to the solar values @xcite , which are consistent with the metallicity of the host galaxy ngc  2906 @xcite . to find the best - fit model , we use maximum likelihood statistics for a poisson distribution ,",
    "the so - called c - statistics @xcite , which minimizes the @xmath29 value defined as @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the model - predicted and observed counts in each spectral bin @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this method is suitable for low - counts spectra that do not allow for the @xmath34-test .",
    "errors on the parameters can be estimated similarly to the @xmath34 method , based on the fact that @xmath35 can be used similarly to @xmath36 @xcite , where @xmath37 is the minimum @xmath29 value obtained at the best - fit . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , the best - fit models represent the data well .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : param1 ] ( no.1 ) .",
    "we find a clear temporal decrease in @xmath19 .",
    "this result is fairly robust from a statistical point of view , as is evident from confidence contours of @xmath28 vs.  @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf_cont ] , where thick and thin lines correspond to the first and the final epochs , respectively . judging from the high temperature ( @xmath386.7kev ) ,",
    "most of the x - ray emission likely arises from a hot plasma in the csm heated by the forward shock .",
    "we also fit the data with the same model in different ways that take account of temperature evolution .",
    "first , we assume that the temperature evolves as @xmath39 , since the temperature is proportional to the square of the shock speed which decreases as @xmath40 in a self - similar solution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the sn radius , @xmath41 , is proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are density profiles in the ejecta and the csm , respectively ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , so that the shock speed , @xmath47 , is proportional to @xmath48 , resulting in @xmath49 for typical density profiles of core - collapse sne , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fit results listed in table  [ tab : param1 ] ( no.2 ) are found to be consistent ( except for the temperature ) with those of the no.1 case .",
    "second , we take into account effects of temperature nonequilibration between electrons and ions due to slow equilibration through coulomb heating .",
    "the temperature nonequilibration may be applicable for sn  2005ip , in which x - rays are likely due mainly to an adiabatic forward shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to this end , we follow @xcite who showed that electron temperature is proportional to @xmath52 for coulomb heating ( equation 10 in * ? ? ? * ) . using the relation @xmath53",
    ", we obtain @xmath54 . by fitting the five spectra with this temperature evolution taken account",
    ", we obtain the results shown in table  [ tab : param1 ] ( no.3 ) , which are consistent ( except for the tempetarue ) with the other cases . finally , we allow @xmath28 to vary freely among the five spectra , while we let @xmath19 be a common free parameter .",
    "this strategy fails to fit the data ( @xmath29 value of 93.1 ; the fit results are presented in table  [ tab : param1 ] no.4 ) , indicating that the spectral softening is not simply due to cooling",
    ". therefore , we are confident that the spectral softening is mainly due to evolution in the absorption .    while nondetection of x - ray emission from reverse - shocked ejecta is not so peculiar for sne  iin ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for completeness we also apply an absorbed two - components apec model , in which the two components are supposed to represent the reverse - shocked ejecta and the forward - shocked csm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite who presented a more detailed modeling especially focusing on x - ray emission from the ejecta by coupling a spectral code to a hydrodynamical code ) . since it is difficult to determine a number of spectral - fit parameters with the relatively poor photon statistics , we initially link temperatures and normalizations of the low - temperature ( ejecta ) component among the five spectra , according to a theoretical expectation by @xcite .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : param2 ] ( no.1 ) .",
    "the two - component model gives a slightly better fit than the one - component model : @xmath554.5 for two extra free parameters ( i.e. , @xmath28 and normalization of the ejecta component ) .",
    "the slight improvement in the fit is not strongly significant , yielding a confidence level of 92% based on the @xmath56-test ; we assume that the @xmath29 values can be treated as @xmath34 values and performed @xmath56-test using the fit - statistics listed in table  [ tab : param2 ] ( no.1 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , as can be seen from the best - fit parameters listed in tables  [ tab : param1 ] and [ tab : param2 ] , the basic best - fit parameters , i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath28 , and normalization of the high - temperature component , derived by the one- and two - component models roughly agree with each other .",
    "next , to see if the spectral softening can be explained by the increasing low - temperature component rather than the @xmath19 evolution , we fit the data with the two - component model in a different fitting strategy , in which we link the @xmath19 parameter among the five epochs while we let the normalization of the low - temperature component vary freely for individual epochs .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : param2 ] ( no.2 ) , from which we find that the model gives a reasonable but slightly worse fit than previous fittings .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity for the low - temperature component is derived to be @xmath010@xmath57ergss@xmath6 at the final epoch ( @xmath06 yr after explosion ) .",
    "this may be unrealistically bright especially for reverse - shock emission ; it is two orders of magnitude brighter than ever recorded at this late phase @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity for the cooler component would be even greater than the value we obtained .",
    "this is because there is almost always a radiative cooling shell between a reverse shock and a forward shock , and the cooling shell will provide an extra absorption of the soft x - rays coming from the reverse shock .",
    "we have also checked that temperature evolution of @xmath39 for both of the two components ( as is expected in a reasonable self - similar solution described above ) does not affect the fit result ( see the results no.3 in table  [ tab : param2 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , in the following discussion , we basically adopt the results from the one - component model in table  [ tab : param1 ] .",
    "the archival x - ray data of sn  2005ip revealed clear spectral softening with time .",
    "our spectral analysis showed that the spectral softening is best explained by declining evolution of the absorbing column density ; @xmath58@xmath3 at the first epoch ( @xmath01yr after explosion ) gradually goes down to be consistent with the galactic absorption , @xmath59@xmath3 , at the final epoch ( @xmath06yr after explosion ) . on the other hand , we find that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity stays constant until the final epoch when it drops by a factor of @xmath02 ( see table  [ tab : param1 ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that the sn was initially embedded in a dense csm , but the forward shock has penetrated the dense csm region at a certain time between 2009 november ( fourth epoch ) and 2012 march ( final epoch ) .",
    "sn  2005ip is the second example in which we see possible evolution in absorption by the external csm after sn  2010jl @xcite . by contrast",
    ", there are several sne that do not show significant @xmath19 evolution .",
    "these include sne 2006jd @xcite , 1987a @xcite , 1998s @xcite , and 1999em @xcite .",
    "sn  1993j would be intermediate between the two types , i.e. , evolving absorption and constant absorption ; @xcite noted possible @xmath19 evolution that may be caused by a cool shell between the forward shock and the reverse shock . a simple speculation to explain the difference between the two types is that the csm is formed as a disk - like shell due to equatorial mass ejections . for this geometry ,",
    "csm absorption strongly depends on the inclination angle of the disk in the sense that strong absorption and its declining evolution is expected for an edge - on view ( which would be responsible for sne 2005ip and 2010jl ) , while little absorption for a face - on view ( for others ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the class of sne without evolution in absorption has somewhat peculiar csm geometries ( while the sne class with strongly evolving absorption has either a relatively spherically symmetric csm or an edge - on disk ) .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed for sn  2006jd that a low - column - density region is present in one direction ( i.e. , a cylindrical shape toward the observer ) while strong interactions are taking place over much of the rest of the solid angle . in order to constrain the csm structures ,",
    "it is essential to increase sne samples that allow for absorption measurements with _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _",
    "swift_.    we estimate mass - loss rates of the progenitor star of sn  2005ip in two different ways .",
    "one is based on the column density which is a robust measure in x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "we compare the measured column density with a theoretical calculation , i.e. , equation ( 4.1 ) in @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nh ] , the data are well represented by either @xmath60@xmath9yr@xmath6 and @xmath61 ( solid ) or @xmath62yr@xmath6 and @xmath63 ( dotted ) with reasonable wind and shock speeds ( @xmath64100kms@xmath6 and @xmath65kms@xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    ", we should not put much weight on the last - epoch data , since the forward shock has likely penetrated the dense csm region ( resulting in a change in the @xmath44 value ) between the fourth epoch and the final epoch . from an astrophysical point of view , the latter case is not realistic ; @xmath62yr@xmath6 is too high and @xmath63 is too steep especially for type  iin sne which are embedded in usually dense environments .",
    "therefore , we favor the former case with the mass - loss rate of @xmath00.015@xmath9yr@xmath6 and @xmath61 .    the other way is based on the x - ray luminosity , as is often used to estimate wind parameters in conjunction with equation ( 3.11 ) in @xcite , which describes x - ray emission from the shocked csm . the much larger absorption than that ( @xmath66@xmath3 ) assumed by @xcite boosts up the intrinsic 0.210kev luminosity to be @xmath01.5@xmath6710@xmath68ergs@xmath6 , which is by an order of magnitude higher than the original value of 1.6@xmath22ergs@xmath6 reported by @xcite .",
    "the revised luminosity places sn  2005ip as one of the brightest x - ray sne among others being sne  2001em @xcite , 2005kd @xcite , 2006jd @xcite and 2010jl @xcite . by integrating the equation from 0.2kev to 10kev ,",
    "it can be rewritten as 2.77@xmath6710@xmath69(1@xmath70)@xmath6(@xmath71/@xmath72)@xmath73(@xmath74kms@xmath6)@xmath75(@xmath76/11.57 days)@xmath75ergs@xmath6 for @xmath77 k , where @xmath78yr@xmath6 ) and @xmath79kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity during the plateau phase , 1st4th epochs when we can reasonably assume that @xmath80 from @xmath81 , gives a mass - loss rate of @xmath82@xmath9yr@xmath6 , which is in agreement with the lower limit of the @xmath19-based @xmath83 estimated above .",
    "therefore , our x - ray  based mass - loss rates are significantly higher than those inferred from the h@xmath18 luminosity ( ( 24@xmath84@xmath9yr@xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the bolometric light curve ( ( 1.21.4)@xmath26@xmath9yr@xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are close to the estimate from ir observations ( ( 7.538)@xmath85@xmath9yr@xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    "our result supports eruptive mass ejections as seen in lbv stars .",
    "interestingly , the evolution in the x - ray luminosity , which is constant for the initial @xmath04yr and drops between the fourth epoch and the final epoch , is similar to that of h@xmath18 emission @xcite .",
    "this similarity confirms a general picture that late - time h@xmath18 emission arises by reprocessing of x - ray emission . the decreasing x - ray and h@xmath18 luminosities at the final epoch",
    "lead us to suggest that the forward shock broke out a dense csm region ( i.e. , entered into a steeper density - profile region ) at some point between the fourth epoch and the final epoch .",
    "the distance that the forward shock ( @xmath65kms@xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) traveled for @xmath86 years , a time span for the forward shock to be within the dense csm region , is calculated to be @xmath02.2@xmath6710@xmath87 cm .",
    "this would be the spatial extent of the erupted material . dividing the distance by the wind speed ( @xmath88kms@xmath6 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can estimate the duration of the eruption to be @xmath0700yr(@xmath76/5yr ) ( @xmath89/14000kms@xmath6 ) ( @xmath90/100kms@xmath6)@xmath6 .",
    "then , the total mass ejected in this eruptive period is calculated to be @xmath014(@xmath76/700yr ) ( @xmath83/0.02@xmath9yr@xmath6)@xmath9 , indicating that the progenitor is quite massive ( @xmath12@xmath9 ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", the constant evolution in the x - ray luminosity ( the plateau phase ) requires that @xmath91 in the framework of general sn evolutionary models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at a grance , this appears to conflict with the @xmath19-based @xmath44-value ranging from @xmath02 to @xmath03 .",
    "however , we should note that such sn evolutionary models assume spherically symmetric csm structures , which may not be valid for sn  2005ip .",
    "for example , the csm geometry may be a disk - like shell , as discussed earlier in this section . in this case",
    ", the constant x - ray luminosity is expected for a density profile of @xmath61 instead of @xmath91 @xcite . on the other hand , evolution in @xmath19",
    "would be similar to that expected for a spherically symmetric csm , if the disk is edge on .",
    "therefore , a disk - like csm structure with @xmath61 would explain evolution in both @xmath19 and luminosity simultaneously without invoking exotic conditions .    there still remains the possibility that the csm structure of sn  2005ip is spherically symmetric . in this case , evolution in @xmath19 and",
    "the luminosity leads to discrepant density profiles , which seems to be a real problem . by noting that absorbing material decreases more rapidly than what is expected from the luminosity evolution , one may think of a possibility that the external cool csm is fully ionized by strong x - ray emission behind the forward shock .",
    "we thus calculate the ionization parameter , @xmath92 . for the x - ray luminosity of @xmath931.5@xmath94ergs@xmath6 , a lower limit density of @xmath95@xmath96 @xcite , and a radius of @xmath97",
    "cm which is a distance for a shock of @xmath98kms@xmath6 to propagate during @xmath01000 days , we obtain that @xmath99 .",
    "this is not sufficient to fully ionize c , n , and o which are main absorbers of x - rays ( cf .",
    "therefore , photoionization is unable to explain the discrepancy in the derived density profile .",
    "the other possibility is to introduce clumpiness in the csm wind , in which shocked clumps sustain the high x - ray luminosity @xcite , while a covering fraction of dense clumps is so small that they do not noticeably affect dynamics of the system and the csm absorption . in this model , a flatter distribution of clumps than that of a global csm density profile",
    "can qualitatively explain both the constant intrinsic luminosity and the rapidly declining @xmath19 .",
    "given that the presence of small clumps is strongly suggested by the late - time development of intermediate - width component of h@xmath18 @xcite , this scenario may be at work .",
    "the clumps will produce significant soft x - ray emission , which is not required in the one - component model , but is seen in the two - component model ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : param2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the clump scenario can not be excluded at the expense of a remarkably strong x - ray emission from the reverse shock .",
    "x - ray spectra from sn  2005ip showed strong spectral softening with time , which we interpret to be due to declining in absorption by external csm . with the absorption taken into account , sn  2005ip turned out to be one of the brightest sne  iin in the x - ray regime",
