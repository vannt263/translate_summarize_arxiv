    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in ultracold gases of bosonic atoms has given great impulse to the study of dilute quantum gases inside magnetic or optical traps @xcite .",
    "similar cooling and trapping techniques are being used to drive gases of fermionic alkali atoms into the quantum degeneracy regime @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to experimentally generate and study strongly anisotropic atomic fluids effectively approaching dimensionality @xmath0 or @xmath1 , at very low temperature and with very high purity , inside magnetic traps where the transverse and the longitudinal confinement are vastly different @xcite .    in the relevant conditions of temperature and dilution the atomic interactions become negligible in a gas of fermions placed in a single zeeman sublevel inside a magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "one can obtain in this way a close laboratory realization of an inhomogeneous , non - interacting fermi gas , which has special significance in regard to the foundations of density functional theory and to tests of the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . in the quasi - onedimensional ( 1d ) case the ground state and the excitation spectrum of such an ideal gas of spin - polarized ( or `` spinless '' ) fermions can be mapped into those of a gas of hard - core impenetrable bosons @xcite .",
    "the latter is known as the tonks gas , from the early work of tonks @xcite on the equation of state of hard - object adsorbates .",
    "advances in atom waveguide technology , with potential applications to atom interferometry and integrated atom optics , especially motivate theoretical studies of dilute gases in a regime where the dynamics becomes essentially 1d @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of a cloud of spinless fermions under harmonic confinement are , of course , slater determinants of harmonic - oscillator single - particle orbitals .",
    "their representation in terms of hermite polynomials has , however , limited usefulness for numerical calculations on mesoscopic clouds @xcite . brack and van zyl @xcite have developed a more powerful method for non - interacting fermions occupying a set of closed shells under isotropic harmonic confinement in d dimensions , leading to analytical expressions for the particle and kinetic energy densities at temperature @xmath2 in terms of laguerre polynomials .",
    "these expressions are especially useful for numerical calculations on isotropic systems in @xmath0 and @xmath3 . a green s function method , which altogether avoids the use of wave functions in favor of the matrix elements of the position and momentum operators , has been developed for similar purposes @xcite and extended to calculations of the pair distribution function in the ground state for the 1d ideal fermi gas @xcite .",
    "this method has also been extended to the ground state of ideal fermi gases under harmonic confinement of arbitrary anisotropy in higher dimensionalities @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the green s function method to an inhomogeneous 1d cloud of non - interacting fermions at finite temperature and to illustrate its usefulness by numerical calculations of the particle and kinetic energy density profiles as functions of temperature in the case of harmonic confinement .",
    "analytical expressions have been derived by wang@xcite for the same system at high temperature , where the chemical potential is lower than the single - particle ground - state energy .",
    "the case of non - interacting fermions under 3d harmonic confinement has been treated by schneider and wallis @xcite through the use of laguerre polynomials .",
    "the emphasis of our numerical calculations will be to illustrate how the characteristic quantum features of the fermion cloud , _ i.e. _ its shell structure and the spill - out of particles at the boundaries beyond the thomas - fermi radius , evolve with increasing temperature as a semiclassical regime is being approached .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reports some essential definitions , starting from the one - body density matrix at @xmath4 , and gives the expressions of the density profiles in the semiclassical regime .",
    "sections iii and iv present the essential details of our method and our numerical results , respectively .",
    "a brief summary concludes the paper in section v. although we refer through the paper to the results as being appropriate to spinless fermions in 1d , they are equally valid for the tonks gas of impenetrable bosons .",

    "( [ infm ] ) converges quite rapidly , yielding accurate results for mesoscopic fermion clouds with a moderate amount of numerical effort .",
    "we report in this section some numerical results for the particle density and the kinetic pressure that we have obtained by the green s function method .",
    "our main purpose is to illustrate the approach of the profiles to their semiclassical expressions and we consider for clarity clouds containing rather small average numbers of particles , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "some sharpening of the structures in the profiles should be expected in a canonical ensemble viewpoint , where fluctuations in the particle number are suppressed .    in the calculations reported below",
    "we have approximated the determinant in eq .",
    "( [ infm ] ) by the product of its first @xmath55 terms with @xmath56 as an upper bound .",
    "this choice allows for up to @xmath57 thermally excited states and the corresponding value of the spectral resolution parameter is chosen as @xmath58 .",
    "these two choices evidently limit to some minor extent the accuracy of our numerical results relatively to the formally exact theory given in sect . iii . of course , for such small numbers of particles one may also approach the same calculations by using directly the expression of the harmonic - oscillator orbitals in eq .",
    "( [ rho_def ] ) .",
    "however , the routines that are available to evaluate hermite polynomials also involve numerical approximations which are increasingly severe for polynomials of high degree , as needed to describe the gas at finite temperature .",
    "the first step in our calculations is to evaluate the chemical potential at fixed @xmath10 by means of a self - consistent solution of eqs .",
    "( [ norm ] ) and ( [ semi - class_nx ] )  @xcite .",
    "the resulting semiclassical value of @xmath7 is used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2_nx ] ) and ( [ eq2_px ] ) for the evaluation of the particle density and kinetic pressure profiles .",
    "the procedure is justified _ a posteriori _ by the fact that integration of the spatial density @xmath12 obtained at this stage reproduces the correct average number @xmath10 of fermions .    in figures 1 and 2",
    "we report the particle density profiles at various temperatures for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding profiles of kinetic pressure are given in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "in each figure the left - hand panel shows how the quantum effects , which consist of oscillations from shell structure in the profiles and in particle spill - out and negative kinetic pressure at the edges , are washed away by thermal excitations .",
    "the right - hand panels show instead how the profiles approach the semiclassical regime : the latter already holds to a good approximation when @xmath59 , although some trace of a negative kinetic pressure in the spill - out region remains in the `` exact '' profile at this temperature .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we have extended to finite temperature the green s function method that was previously developed for the formally exact evaluation of ground - state properties of an inhomogeneous ideal fermi gas in 1d .",
    "the method dispenses with knowledge of the single - particle orbitals in favour of the single - particle energy levels and of the matrix elements of the position and momentum operators .",
    "our numerical applications to clouds containing small numbers of particles under harmonic confinement have shown that the commonly used semiclassical approach to a thermally excited fermion cloud yields ( i ) accurate values of the chemical potential except at the lowest temperatures , and ( ii ) a reliable account of particle and kinetic energy density profiles once their main quantum features become essentialy washed out at @xmath59 .",
    "two further comments are in order .",
    "firstly , the profiles shown in figures 1 and 2 also describe ( aside from an immediate rescaling of the units used on the axes ) the momentum distribution of the fermion cloud under harmonic confinement .",
    "secondly , the same profiles also refer to the tonks gas of impenetrable bosons in 1d , as was explicitly shown by yang and yang @xcite .",
