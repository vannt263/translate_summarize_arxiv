    "spiral arms play an important role in galactic evolution in diverse ways ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they exert non - axisymmetric torque to stars and gas clouds in galaxy rotation and cause their radial migrations , leading to secular density changes of the disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they also provide sites for active star formation , which is either triggered or organized by the stellar spiral potentials ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for review ) .",
    "therefore , understanding the nature and properties of spiral arms is crucial to understand secular , chemical , and dynamical evolution of disk galaxies .    in terms of lifetime of spiral arms ,",
    "the theory of spiral structure has forked into two branches : long - lived quasi - stationary density waves @xcite and short - lived transient features @xcite .",
    "the first picture requires that self - gravity plays a key role in organizing density waves into a self - sustained global pattern that rotates almost rigidly about the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "it successfully predicts systematic offsets between narrow dust lanes and star - forming regions associated with the arms ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also section 6.4.3 of @xcite ) , although it does not address the origin of the density waves . in the second picture ,",
    "on the other hand , spiral arms are transient waves that wind up over time as they propagate inward in the radial direction . in this case , spiral arms last only for a few rotation periods .",
    "numerical simulations of isolated disk galaxies show that noises inherent in a stellar disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) or perturbations provided by giant molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) are amplified as they swing from leading to trailing configurations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and form transient but recurrent spiral arms .",
    "such swing - amplified arms in isolated galaxies are usually ragged with multiple arms rather than being grand - design spirals with prominent two arms .",
    "observations indicate that among samples that include both non - barred and barred spiral galaxies , the probability of having grand - design arms is higher for galaxies with companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .. recently , @xcite analyzed spiral structures in a sample of galaxies from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey and found that the strength of grand - design arms is rather tightly correlated with tidal forcing from nearby companion galaxies , while the arm morphologies depend very weakly on the galaxy parameters such as stellar mass , gas fraction , disk / bulge ratio , rotational velocity , etc .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction of grand - design arms , especially for very strong arms , are driven most likely by tidal interactions .",
    "@xcite pioneered a numerical study for tidal interaction of disk galaxies using noninteracting test particles , and found that extended structures such as tidal tails and bridges develop in the course of galaxy encounters .",
    "subsequent @xmath0-body simulations focused on very strong encounters that lead to galaxy mergers or significant transformation of disk morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some studies concentrated on the orbital parameters required to reproduce the observed morphologies and kinematic features of interacting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while others investigated properties of tidally - induced spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite found that the spiral arms generated in a cold disk by weak tidal interaction wind up from sc to sa appearances .",
    "@xcite showed that inner spiral arms are created if the tidal strength parameter @xmath1 ( see below for definition ) is larger than @xmath8 , suggesting that even a low - mass companion can tidally excite grand - design arms if the pericenter distance is small enough . to characterize the tidal strength",
    ", @xcite instead used the @xmath2 parameter ( see also below for definition ) that takes into account the interaction duration , finding that a tidal encounter with @xmath9 deforms the outer disk into an `` ocular '' shape .",
    "numerical simulations often show that tidally - induced arms are transient and posses the characteristics of kinematic density waves .",
    "for example , @xcite found that spiral arms driven by tidal forces resemble kinematic density waves when self - gravity is weak . in modeling tidal interactions of the m51/ngc 5195 system",
    ", @xcite found that spiral arms in m51 can not be described by a single pattern speed , indicative of kinematic density waves .",
    "@xcite showed that spiral arms in an isolated galaxy generated by swing amplification of random perturbations have a pattern speed that decreases with the galactocentric radius @xmath10 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also found that the pattern speed of @xmath11 arms driven by a satellite on a bound eccentric orbit decreases with radius .    to quantify how the physical properties of the tidally - driven arms depend on @xmath2 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ran a series of @xmath0-body simulations by considering a stellar disk inside a fixed halo interacting with a point mass companion on a prescribed parabolic orbit .",
    "paper  i found that a tidal bridge consists of the disk particles pulled out by the tidal perturbations , with their epicycle phases locked to the companion , while a tidal tail forms as strongly perturbed near - side particles overtake mildly perturbed far - side particles .",
    "paper  i also found that a stronger encounter produces stronger , more open arms that start to develop earlier at smaller @xmath10 .",
    "the arm pattern speed turned out to be a decreasing function of @xmath10 even when the arms are strongest , and converges to the @xmath12 curve as they decay .",
    "this suggests that tidally - driven arms are unlikely to be quasi - stationary density waves .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite who included a gaseous disk as well in simulating the m51/ngc 5195 system , although gravity of the gaseous component tends to increase the arm pattern speed .",
    "@xcite suggested that these are caustic waves maintained by coherent epicycle oscillations triggered by tidal forcing .",
    "while the results of the paper  i are informative in assessing the quantitative effects of tidal perturbations on the arm properties , they were based on highly idealized galaxy models .",
    "first of all , paper  i considered an infinitesimally - thin , two - dimensional ( 2d ) stellar disk .",
    "this not only neglects nonplanar motions but also overestimates self - gravity of the disk , making the spiral arms stronger than in disks with finite thickness .",
    "in addition , paper  i employed fixed gravitational potentials for the halo / bulge and the perturbing companion .",
    "this precludes the possibility of dynamical friction occurring due to their gravitational reactions to the tidal perturbations .",
    "moreover , the galaxy and the companion in paper  i were set to follow the prescribed parabolic orbits , which ignores their orbital decay caused by angular momentum loss . by evolving the system in the frame in which the galaxy remains stationary , paper",
    "i also ignored indirect forces arising from the orbital motion of the galaxy relative to the center of mass of the system , potentially suppressing the growth of lopsided spiral modes in the stellar disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to overcome the caveats mentioned above , we in this paper extend paper  i by considering a self - consistent three - dimensional ( 3d ) galaxy model in which the stellar disk has a finite thickness and a central bugle and a dark halo",
    "are represented by live particles rather than by fixed potentials .",
    "the perturbing companion is modeled by a live halo alone for simplicity . as in paper",
    "i , we control the strength of a tidal encounter by varying two parameters : the pericenter distance and the galaxy - to - companion mass ratio .",
    "our objective is four - fold .",
    "first , we wish to measure the physical properties of tidally - induced spiral arms in more realistic 3d models and compare them with those in the razor - thin counterpart .",
    "we will also find the quantitative dependence of the arm properties on both @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "second , @xcite and @xcite showed that the formation of tidal tails depends on the shape of the galactic potential .",
    "we will show that the tail formation depend not only on the potential shape but also on the tidal stregnth .",
    "third , we want to explore 3d density structures inside spiral arms and compare them with the analytic formulae proposed by @xcite .",
    "finally , we will show that dynamical friction of the companion in the course of a tidal interaction can be a source of the spin angular momentum of the primary halo .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",

    "[ sec : properties ] , we present the properties of tidal tails formed in the outer parts and spiral arms in the inner parts . in section  [ sec : armdensity ] , we analyze the 3d density structures of spiral arm in the radial and vertical directions and compare them with the prediction of @xcite . in section  [ sec : orbit_decay ] , we explore the orbital decay of the galaxy caused by dynamical friction , which results in spin - up of the initially non - rotating halo .",

    "when the galaxies are separated widely ( @xmath88 ) , tidal perturbations are so weak that the orbits are parabolic and the disk of the primary remains almost axisymmetric .",
    "as the perturbing galaxy approaches the pericenter , the tidal force begins to excite the epicycle motions of stars in the outer disk , first shaping them into a bridge at the near side to the companion ( @xmath89 ) and then a tail at the opposite side ( @xmath90 ) . in the bridge , the epicycle phases of the constituting particles are forced to be aligned to the companion in such a manner that the radial velocities and the gradient of the azimuthal velocities are always maximized along the line connecting the galaxies ( paper  i ) . on the other hand , the tidal tail develops as strongly perturbed particles at the near side catch up and overlap with mildly perturbed particles at the far side ( paper  i ; @xcite ) .",
    "the tail is approximately logarithmic in shape , indicating that its pitch angle is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "the tails and bridges produced in our models are transient and decay after @xmath91 .",
    "as the companion recedes , the tidal force becomes weaker and is thus unable to keep the coherency of the forced epicycle phases of the bridge particles .",
    "composed of particles gathered from a wide range of radii in the unperturbed disk , the tails have a large velocity dispersion , tending to disperse with time .",
    "they disappear almost completely at @xmath92 .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath93 ) of the disk particles that achieve velocities larger than the escape velocity become unbound , either captured by the companion or escaping from the system . with no further perturbations from the companion at @xmath94 ,",
    "on the other hand , the bound particles once in the bridge or tail spread out , following galaxy rotation with large eccentricities .",
    "the disk becomes increasingly featureless over time .",
    "paper  i found that the formation time , shape , and strength of the tails in 2d models are well correlated with @xmath2 . to study how the correlations change in the current self - consistent 3d models , we define the tail formation epoch , @xmath62 , as the time when it becomes densest at @xmath67 , and measure its pitch angle @xmath95 and surface density @xmath96 at that time .",

    "this threshold is probably a lower limit since all of our models consider in - plane , prograde encounters , the most favorable condition for the tail development .",

    "the spiral arms achieve the full strength at @xmath173@xmath174 with smaller values corresponding to stronger tidal interaction , after which they begin to decay .",
    "this is mainly caused by the increase in the velocity dispersions of the disk particles .",
    "first of all , the growth of spiral arms requires the particles at different radii to gather into the arms , which increases the velocity dispersions ( paper  i ) .",
    "also , heating of the disk particles due to gravitational scattering off the arms becomes efficient once the arms are strong enough , inhibiting further growth of the arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the increased velocity dispersions make the epicycle orbits in the arms kinematically less coherent .",
    "figure  [ fig : f - r](b ) shows that the amplitudes of the arms in the current 3d models decrease with time almost exponentially , with a characteristic timescale of @xmath175gyr , about twice faster than in the 2d models of paper  i. the faster decay of the arms in the 3d models is presumably due to weaker disk gravity in a stratified disk , which makes the arms wind out at a faster rate as well .",

    "they are rather kinematic density waves slightly modified by gravity .",
    "due to reduced self - gravity , spiral arms in the 3d models are weaker and decay faster than those in the razor - thin counterparts .",

    "this validates that dynamical friction is indeed a primary cause of the angular momentum transfer in our numerical simulations .",
    "a close inspection of figure  [ fig : angmom ] reveals that while the orbital angular momenta of the halo and companion decrease monotonically with time , those of the disk and bulge stay almost constant at @xmath276 , increase slightly for @xmath277 , and subsequently decrease slowly .",

    "it is apparent that the torque by the companion is overall positive , while the halo gives a negative torque to the disk / bulge .",
    "the resultant net torque , shown as the solid line , is positive for @xmath278 , which boosts the orbital motion of the disk / bulge system .    to understand why the companion torque is positive , figure  [ fig : bulgedisp ] plots the density distributions of the companion ( gray scale with black contours ) and the disk and bulge of the primary ( white contours ) at @xmath73 ( left ) and @xmath279 ( right ) of model ta2h in the orbital plane .",

    "the dynamical friction of the primary due to the companion is stronger for the ( outer ) halo than the disk / bulge owing to proximity to the companion .",
    "this causes the halo to move slower than the rest of the primary galaxy , gradually making them displaced from each other . at @xmath73 , the center of mass of the disk / bulge is entering the third quadrant and moving in the negative-@xmath283 direction , while that of the halo is still in the second quadrant . at this time",

    "the tidal force from the companion excites epicycle motions in the outer regions of the primary , forming a bridge at the near side and an extended tail at the far side for interactions with @xmath292 or @xmath293 : tidal forcing weaker than this is unable to produce a tidal tail .",
    "the tail formation time , pitch angle , and surface density measured at @xmath67 scale as @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 in terms of @xmath1 , and @xmath297 , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the 2d results of paper  i , although the 2d tails are slightly stronger than the 3d counterparts , due to stronger gravity in the disk midplane .",
    "we also find that the tail response @xmath108 defined by the fraction of the disk particles consisting of a tail at @xmath300 has an excellent correlation with @xmath2 as @xmath113 .",
    "the tidal force also excites two - armed spiral density waves over a range of radii in the inner parts of the disk .",
    "we calculate the spatial and temporal dependence of the arm strength @xmath137 defined by the ratio of the maximum gravitational force due to the @xmath11 modes to the centrifugal force of disk rotation ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : f ] ] ) . for intermediate tidal interactions with @xmath153 ( or @xmath185 ) , the arms are strongest at @xmath301@xmath184 , while weak interaction models with @xmath157 ( or @xmath158 ) have the arms induced at @xmath155@xmath156 .",
    "the spiral arms are stronger in models with larger @xmath1 or @xmath2 , with the peak arm strength given by @xmath164 or @xmath165 .",
    "the spiral arms are approximately logarithmic in shape , with a pitch angle @xmath194 when the arms are strongest . after the peak ,",
    "the arms decay with a timescale of @xmath302 , and wind out as @xmath303 .",
    "the derived arm pattern speed @xmath211 is a decreasing function of @xmath10 and becomes close to the @xmath5 curve at late time .",
    "this suggests that the induced spiral arms are kinematic density waves modified weakly by self - gravity .",
    "compared to the 2d counterparts , arms in 3d models are weaker , have a smaller pitch angle , and wind and decay more rapidly with time , due to weaker gravity .",
    "when compared with the analytic expression of @xcite , the 3d density structure of tidally - induced , @xmath11 arms can be reasonably well described by the concentrated arms when the arms are in the nonlinear regime with @xmath248 . on the other hand ,",
    "arms in the linear regime with @xmath249 are better fitted by the sinusoidal model .",
    "the perturbed density in the arm regions follows the characteristic profile @xmath304 along the vertical direction , with the scale height @xmath305 not much different from that of the initial disk .",
    "4 .   the halos of the primary and companion become partially overlap in the course of a tidal encounter .",
    "this creates gravitational density wakes in the halos , resulting in dynamical friction .",
    "the dynamical friction has a few notable effects .",
    "first , it transports the orbital angular momentum of one galaxy to the spin angular momentum of the halo of its companion , making the pericenter distance smaller than that under the rigid halos .",
    "second , the initially rotation - free halos achieve the mass - weighted rotational velocities amounting to @xmath306 and @xmath307 for the primary and companion , respectively .",
    "third , the dynamical friction is stronger for the halo , causing offsets between the centers of mass of the halo and disk / bulge of the primary",
    ". thus , the disk / bulge can temporarily gain angular momentum by a positive torque from the companion near the pericenter , although they are later pulled back to the center of mass of the halo as the companion moves away .",
    "tidal interaction of a galaxy with its companion in a prograde orbit is studied using fully consistent @xmath0-body models .",
    "we find that the physical properties of the tidally - induced nonaxisymmetric features are tightly correlated with the interaction strength parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these correlations are in qualitative agreement with those from the 2d results presented in paper  i , although the structures in the 3d models are generally weaker and decay more rapidly .",
    "these are also qualitatively consistent with the results of @xcite who described in terms of @xmath2 the formation criteria of the outer disk features such as double arms corresponding to spiral arms decoupling from the tidal tail .",
    "@xcite similarly found that the tidal strength @xmath1 determines the strength of grand - design spiral arms in interacting galaxies .",
    "overall , @xmath2 is a better parameter for characterizing tidal tails formed in the outer regions , while spiral arms induced in the inner regions are better correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "strength and shapes of tidal tails have been used to constrain the masses of dark halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using numerical simulations , @xcite found that a tidal tail becomes shorter and less massive as the mass and size of a dark halo increase due to a shorter interaction time as well as a deeper potential well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more quantitatively , @xcite suggested @xmath308 as an indicator of the susceptibility of a disk galaxy to the tail formation , where @xmath309 and @xmath310 refer to the escape and circular velocities at @xmath311 , respectively .",

    ", @xcite showed that the maximum tidal response @xmath106 described in section [ sec : tail ] is inversely proportional to @xmath312 .",
    "they argued that tidal forcing produces a tail with a substantial amplitude only when @xmath314 in their models .",
    "@xcite conducted an extensive survey of galaxy collisions , and confirmed that @xmath312 is really a governing parameter and must be less than @xmath315 for the tail formation .",
    "our primary galaxy has @xmath316 , corresponding to the lower end in the models of @xcite ( see their figure 10 ) .",
    "based on the results of @xcite and @xcite , therefore , one can naturally expect strong tidal tails produced in all of our simulations .",
    "however , it turns out that a tail is absent in model tb3 with @xmath317 , while all the other models with @xmath318 do produce a tail with strength depending on @xmath2 .",
    "model tb3 has a very weak tidal response at @xmath319 from particles captured by the companion , even if it is more prone , in terms of @xmath312 , to the tail formation than any model of @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the tail formation should depend not only on @xmath312 but also on the interaction strength .",
    "our numerical results imply that a criterion for producing a tidal tail is @xmath318 ( or @xmath320 ) for @xmath316 .",
    "the critical values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 would increase with increasing @xmath312 , since it would then become increasingly difficult to make disk particles climb out of the halo potential well .",
    "we found that spiral arms induced by a tidal encounter are approximately logarithmic , consistent with many of observed grand - design spirals including m51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our models , a logarithmic shape results from the fact that the spiral arms in the present simulations are close to kinematic density waves , slightly modified by self - gravity , for which the pitch angle varies with time and space as @xmath321 ( e.g. , eq .  ( 6.26 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation curve of our galaxy model shown in figure [ fig : rotprofile ] gives @xmath322 at @xmath323 where arms are induced , making @xmath324 roughly constant over @xmath10 .",
    "this predicts that kinematic density waves wind out with time as @xmath325 when self - gravity is neglected . since @xmath326 for galactic disks ,",
    "this also predicts that @xmath324 is smaller for larger @xmath327 , consistent with the observational results that the arm pitch angle has a negative correlation with the shear rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our results show that self - gravity reduces the arm - winding rate to @xmath328 , although it is not strong enough to maintain the arms quasi - steady .",
    "this holds even in 2d models with overestimated self - gravity at the disk midplane ( paper  i ) .",
    "another prediction of kinetic density waves is that the arm pattern speed is not strictly constant over the radius but a decreasing function of @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the pattern speed of the arms in m81 interacting with ngc 3077 is best described by @xmath329@xmath330 based on the @xcite method , after taking allowance for the radial variation of @xmath211 .",
    "@xcite applied a similar method to m51 in obvious interaction with ngc 5195 , and found that the arms consist of multiple patterns with larger pattern speeds at smaller radii ( see also @xcite ) , although it is questionable whether they are really multiple patterns with different pattern speeds or a single pattern with radially - varying @xmath211 .",
    "realistic interaction models of @xcite for the m51/ngc 5195 pair also predict @xmath211 close to the @xmath5 curve over a range of radii where the arms are strong .",
    "it is interesting to note the spiral arms in the isolated galaxy ngc 1068 have a pattern speed that decreases steeply with @xmath10 , indicative of a short lifetime of order of @xmath331 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "all of these suggest that arms in real spiral galaxies are more likely transient rather than possessing the characteristics of quasi - stationary density waves unless the disks are strongly self - gravitating .",
    "while we employ very simple galaxy models for tidal interactions , our models can well be applied to the m51/ngc 5195 system that have the mass ratio of @xmath332@xmath333 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a pericenter distance of @xmath334@xmath335 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , corresponding to models ta1 and ta2 .",
    "as figure [ fig : f - r ] shows , the arm strength is maximized @xmath336 after the pericenter passage .",
    "@xcite found observationally that the age distribution of star clusters in the arms of m51 has a narrow peak at @xmath337@xmath338 and a broad peak at @xmath339@xmath340 .",
    "if the enhanced star formation is really triggered by tidal effects , the m51/ngc 5195 pair might have undergone double interactions , the first one @xmath341@xmath342 ago and the second one @xmath343@xmath344 ago @xcite , considering the time delay between the arm formation and the closest approach . the peak arm strength in models ta1 and ta2 is @xmath345 , consistent with the radially averaged value of @xmath346 from @xmath347-band observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the arm pitch angle at peak is @xmath348 in models ta1 and ta2 ( figure [ fig : winding ] ) , which is also consistent with the observed pitch angle of @xmath349 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on our numerical results , the stellar spiral arms in m51 are in the nonlinear regime and their 3d density structure may be described by the concentrated arm model of @xcite .    by analyzing the properties of @xmath11 spiral arms in the _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared nearby galaxies survey , @xcite very recently found that spiral morphology depends only weakly on the galaxy properties , while the arm strength is tightly correlated with tidal forcing from nearby companions .",
    "their figure 17 shows that @xmath350 is an increasing function of @xmath1 , which agrees with our numerical results qualitatively , but seemingly not quantitatively .",
    "that is , @xmath170 of the arms in the _ spitzer _ samples varies in the range of @xmath351@xmath352 for @xmath353@xmath354 , while our results predict @xmath355@xmath356 only for @xmath357 and no arm induced for @xmath358 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite noted , this apparent quantitative discrepancy may arise because the observed @xmath1 values in the _ spitzer _ samples correspond to the projected distance of a nearest neighbor at the current epoch , while @xmath1 in our models measures the tidal force using the 3d distance at the epoch of the pericenter passage .",
    "the projection effect overestimates the tidal forcing , while the distance at the current epoch is likely to underestimate the true @xmath1 significantly .",
    "for example , a comparison between figure 17 of @xcite and our figure [ fig : m2m0_p ] suggests that ngc 1566 with @xmath355 and the current forcing estimate of @xmath359 might probably have undergone an interaction with its companion ngc 1581 with @xmath360 at the pericenter passage .    finally , we remark on the absence of a bar in our numerical simulations . as figures [ fig : surf_xy ] and [ fig : surf_phir ]",
    "show , tidal forcing in our models induces spiral structures at @xmath361 , while the inner regions with @xmath362 remain almost unaffected .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who showed that disks subject to tidal interaction can be unstable to form a bar .",
    "the major difference between the galaxy models used by the present paper and their work is that our models possess a relatively strong bulge , while their models have no or very weak bulge .",
    "the strong bulge in our models puts an inner lindbland resonance which suppresses feedback to swing amplification that would otherwise produce a bar near the center @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a strong bulge may be responsible for the absence of a bar in non - barred grand design spiral galaxies .",
