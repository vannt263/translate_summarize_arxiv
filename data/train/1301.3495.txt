    "the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is thought to have a spin - liquid ground - state due to the interplay of geometric frustration and large quantum fluctuations of spin-1/2 moments@xcite .",
    "this model is ( approximately ) realized in the material herbertsmithite ( zncu@xmath1(oh)@xmath2cl@xmath3 ) , which consists of layers of cu@xmath4 ions with antiferromagnetically interacting spin-1/2 magnetic moments arranged in a structurally perfect kagome lattice@xcite .",
    "there is compelling evidence that herbertsmithite has a spin - liquid ground - state .",
    "it shows no signs of magnetic order down to the lowest accessible temperatures @xmath5mk , well below the magnetic exchange scale @xmath6k .",
    "instead , at low - temperatures , it exhibits power law temperature dependence of spin - susceptibility @xmath7 and heat capacity @xmath8@xcite , as well as a knight shift that tends to a constant at low t.@xcite these features are suggestive of gapless ( or at least nearly gapless ) spinon excitations .",
    "moreover , recent neutron measurements show a broad spectrum of spin - excitations consistent with a low - energy spinon continuum@xcite .",
    "while herbertsmithite is a promising spin - liquid candidate , the detailed nature of its putative spin - liquid ground - state remains mysterious .",
    "evidence for gapless spinon excitations led to early suggestions that the material might realize a u(1 ) dirac spin - liquid ( dsl ) with fermionic spinons whose low - energy dispersion consists of two dirac cones@xcite .",
    "projected wave - function studies showed that spin - wave - functions obtained from the dsl mean - field ansatz have very good energy with no variational parameters@xcite ( even lower energies can be achieved by applying a few lanczos steps to the dsl wave - function@xcite ) .",
    "however , recent advances in density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques have enabled simulation of wide 1d strips , which suggest that the ground state of the kagome heisenberg model is instead a @xmath0 spin - liquid with a sizeable spin - gap@xcite .",
    "the issue is complicated by the observation that the @xmath0 spin - liquid found in dmrg for is very sensitive to small perturbations away from the pure heisenberg model@xcite . in light of this observation",
    ", it is quite plausible that additional ingredients such as disorder or spin - orbit coupling play an important role in determining the ground - state properties of herbertsmithite .",
    "these theoretical difficulties highlight the need for new experimental probes that can more directly measure the properties of emergent spinon excitations .",
    "for example , it was recently proposed that spin - orbit coupling could enable neutron scattering measurements to detect the gapless emergent gauge fluctuations present in the u(1 ) dirac spin - liquid theory@xcite .",
    "ac electrical conductivity measurements offer another route for measuring the structure of low - energy spin excitations . despite the host material being a strong mott insulator ,",
    "it was previously pointed out for a u(1 ) spin - liquid that virtual charge - fluctuations can enable power - law absorption deep within the mott gap@xcite .",
    "indeed , in - gap optical absorption has been observed in organic spin - liquid candidates@xcite , but the data does not go to very low frequencies .",
    "these suggestions have led to recent measurements of the electromagnetic properties of single - crystal samples of herbertsmithite , at terahertz frequencies@xcite .",
    "this work finds a low - power - law frequency dependence to ac conductivity inside the mott gap , whose magnitude increases as temperature is lowered .    inspired by this work",
    ", we revisit the issue of sub - gap ac electrical conductivity of candidate spin - liquid states for herbertsmithite .",
    "we consider two scenarios in which herbertsmithte forms either 1 ) a u(1 ) dirac spin - liquid with fermionic spinons and an emergent u(1 ) gauge field or 2 ) a nearly gapless @xmath0 spin - liquid in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition to non - collinear antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order . within these scenarios ,",
    "we find three distinct mechanisms for power - law optical absorption .",
    "all of these mechanisms produce conductivity with frequency dependence : @xmath9 , but are expected to have different magnitudes .",
    "the first two mechanisms are specific to a u(1 ) spin - liquid and rely on linear coupling between the applied ac electrical field and the emergent gauge electric field .",
    "first , in a u(1 ) spin - liquid , an external electric field creates virtual charge fluctuations that produce emergent electric fields .",
    "this mechanism is a strong - coupling generalization of the ioffe - larkin mechanism for optical absorption previously discussed in refs .  . here ,",
    "we adapt strong - coupling expansion results by bulaevskii et al.@xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to establish a clear microscopic origin of this effect , and enables semi - quantitative estimates of its magnitude .",
    "second , an external electric field can create a lattice distortion that is non - uniform within the unit cell , but uniform across different unit - cells .",
    "such lattice distortions perturb the spin - system with the same symmetry as the virtual polarization mechanism@xcite . the magnitude of conductivity from the first mechanism is expected to be parametrically smaller than that of the second , since virtual charge excitations are suppressed by a factor of @xmath10 in a strong mott insulator ( where @xmath11 is the hopping and @xmath12 is the on - site repulsion ) .",
    "however , it turns out that the charge - fluctuation mechanism is enhanced by a large numerical prefactor , and may actually be of the same order as the second magneto - elastic mechanism .",
    "both of these effects give roughly the same order of magnitude as observed in terahertz measurements by pilon et al.@xcite .",
    "in addition , we have identified a third mechanism for absorption based on magneto - elastic and spin - orbit couplings .",
    "here , an applied electric field induces lattice distortions , perturbing the magnetic system . due to the special pattern of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions for the kagome lattice , these spin - perturbations induce uniform spin - currents .",
    "absorption from this mechanism follows @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the spin - conductivity of the magnetic system , thereby allowing an all electrical probe of spin - transport .",
    "moreover , this mechanism is quite generic ; it is not particular to u(1 ) spin - liquids , but will also produce @xmath9 absorption in a nearly gapless @xmath0 spin - liquid , or even in a thermal paramagnetic with diffusive spin - transport .",
    "absorption through this spin - orbit based mechanism is suppressed by a factor of @xmath15 compared to the second mechanism described above , where @xmath16 is the magnitude of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , and @xmath17 is the magnetic exchange coupling .",
    "before describing possible sub - gap absorption mechanisms , we briefly review the slave - particle effective theory approaches for describing u(1 ) and @xmath0 spin - liquids .",
    "the ground - state properties of strong ( @xmath19 ) mott insulators at half - filling are well described by eliminating doubly occupied sites in a @xmath20 expansion to obtain an effective spin model @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 label sites of the kagome lattice . to describe quantum disordered spin - liquid states of this",

    "a physical spin - wave function can be obtained from the mean - field hamiltonian by projecting out the unphysical doubly occupied sites : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes a projection that removes double occupancies .",
    "this spin - wave function can then be used as a variational ansatz .    at the mean - field level , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . for the kagome lattice heisenberg model ,",
    "the procedure outlined above favors a state with @xmath35 and with a sign structure of @xmath36 such that each hexagon has an odd number of negative bonds , and each triangle has an even number@xcite .",

    "while the dirac spin - liquid wave - function gives a good energy for the spin-1/2 kagome heisenberg model without any variational parameters , dmrg studies indicate that a @xmath0 spin - liquid with a sizeable ( @xmath53 ) gap to spin excitations has even lower variational energy . for herbertsmithite ,",
    "a large - gap @xmath0 spin - liquid is inconsistent with observations of gapless behavior@xcite down to energy scales well below @xmath54 .",
    "however , additional ingredients such as disorder and spin - orbit coupling , not present in the pure heisenberg model , could suppress the @xmath0 gap , leading to a nearly gapless state consistent with experiments .",
    "for example , slave particle mean - field studies of large @xmath55 analogs of the spin-1/2 kagome heisenberg model suggest that the spin-1/2 model is naturally close to such an @xmath56 quantum critical point between a @xmath0 spin - liquid and @xmath57 magnetic order@xcite .",
    "therefore , while the main focus of this paper will be on the u(1 ) dirac spin - liquid , we will also explore optical conductivity mechanisms for a nearly gapless @xmath0 spin - liquid . in this section",
    ", we give a brief review of the slave - particle formulation of @xmath0 spin - liquids , and their possible phase transitions to magnetically ordered states .",
    "@xmath0 spin - liquids may be described in the schwinger fermion effective field theory approach by introducing non - vanishing pairing terms @xmath58 into the spinon - mean - field ansatz .",
    "an alternative description can be obtained by using bosonic rather than fermionic spinons : @xmath59 subject to the constraint that @xmath27 .",
    "this description also has a local u(1 ) redundancy leading to emergent , compact u(1 ) gauge degrees of freedom . in the schwinger boson formulation ,",
    "the @xmath0 spin - liquid state is a superfluid of pairs of bosons with @xmath60 but @xmath61 .",
    "the pair condensate breaks the @xmath18 gauge degree of freedom down to a residual @xmath0 degree of freedom associated with @xmath62 . when treated exactly , the fermionic and bosonic formulations of the @xmath0 spin - liquids are of course equivalent ; and in certain cases one can explicitly construct a duality between the two descriptions , where the boson @xmath63 is just a vortex in the fermionic paired superfluid@xcite .    unlike the fermionic decomposition , the bosonic formulation allows a simple description of magnetically ordered states as superfluid states with @xmath64 .",
    "since the frustrated kagome geometry precludes collinear antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , it is natural to consider non - collinear ( but co - planar ) afm order with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is a lattice - scale wave - vector whose precise form depends on the particular type of non - collinear afm order@xcite .",
    "this formulation also naturally describes a continuous phase transition between @xmath0 spin - liquid and non - collinear afm , in which the spinon pairing order parameter - amplitude vanishes continuously without proliferating topological defects of the superfluid order .",
    "the critical theory of such a transition contains gapless , deconfined spinons , and the critical properties are those of a relativistic o(4)@xmath68 quantum critical point@xcite . here",
    "@xmath68 denotes the fractionalized critical point in which the fractionalized objects obey the ordinary o(4 ) critical scaling , but in which the physical degrees of freedom are composite operators of these fractionalized fields .",
    "interestingly , the quantum critical properties largely independent of the particular details of the type of @xmath0 spin - liquid or non - collinear afm order .",
    "on symmetry grounds , a uniform external electric field , @xmath69 , will couple to any time - reversal even and spatially uniform operator that transforms like a vector representation of the kagome symmetry group . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the electric field couples only to spin - singlet operators . in the u(1 ) dirac theory , the operators with lowest scaling dimension are the 15 fermion - bilinear mass terms@xcite : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are pauli matrices in the valley basis . since @xmath74 and @xmath75 break translational invariance they can not couple to a uniform @xmath69 , and since @xmath76 is a scalar , only its spatial derivative can couple to @xmath69 ( which would not contribute in the optical conductivity regime : @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) .    the next lowest dimensional operators are : the emergent gauge fields @xmath79 and @xmath63 , and conserved spinon - number current @xmath80 and spinon spin - current @xmath81 ( here @xmath22 refers to the direction of the current of the @xmath82 component of spin ) . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , only @xmath79 has the right symmetries to couple to @xmath69 . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling",

    "similar symmetry arguments can be applied to identify the low - energy operators of the critical @xmath0 spin - liquid theory that may couple to an external electrical field .",
    "while there is no gapless emergent electric field in this scenario , in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the conserved spin - current may couple to @xmath69 again giving @xmath9 .",
    "the emergent @xmath56 symmetry of the @xmath0-afm quantum critical point gives rise to 9 low - dimensional operators with the small scaling dimensions@xcite .",
    "if coupling to these operators were allowed , it would contribute very low power - law frequency dependence @xmath88 based on their known scaling dimensions .",
    "however , only higher time - derivatives of these operators can couple to @xmath69 , giving higher power conductivity @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the operator that couples to @xmath69 in the @xmath0-afm critical point is : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is an unknown coefficient and @xmath87 represent less relevant operators .",
    "these general considerations greatly constrain the operator form of the physical current operator , and predict conductivity scaling like @xmath92 . in the following sections , we explore microscopic origins of these symmetry allowed couplings , in order to estimate the size of the coefficients @xmath93 .",

    "is altered . as described previously ,",

    "the appearance of this new term shows directly that any perturbation that couples to the z - magnetization will tend to induce an emergent - gauge - magnetic flux .",
    "for example , as discussed in further detail in ref .  , these considerations demonstrate that neutron scattering experiments can in principle be used to detect gapless fluctuations in @xmath63 .    furthermore , it has implications for the behavior of herbertsmithite in an applied magnetic field .",
    "for example , the zeeman term @xmath287 from an external field @xmath288 along z will induce a magnetization @xmath289 , which will produce a corresponding gauge magnetic flux @xmath290 . in perfectly clean dirac spin - liquid",
    ", the density of states vanishes at the dirac point , and the spin susceptibility grows linearly with @xmath291 : @xmath292 .",
    "empirically , however , herbertsmithite appears to have spin - susceptibility that tends to a constant of order a fraction of @xmath293 at low temperature@xcite . within the u(1 ) spin - liquid scenario , one could possibly interpret this finite susceptibility as a finite density of states induced , for example , by impurity scattering",
    ".    in this case , the induced magnetization per spin from an external field @xmath288 would be : @xmath294 , producing an emergent gauge flux through each triangle of order @xmath295 .",
    "this emergent gauge flux has a magnetic length @xmath296 , which corresponds roughly to the ordinary orbital magnetic length an electron gas in the field @xmath288 .",
    "therefore we expect that in a u(1 ) spin - liquid , the spinons will see this induce @xmath63 flux as an orbital field , with an effective @xmath63-flux density that is comparable the physical flux density of @xmath288 .",
    "this is effect is surprisingly large , since charge motion is largely frozen deep in the mott insulating phase , and purely electronic mechanisms give effective flux for spinons that is smaller factor of @xmath297 compared to the physical flux@xcite .    this large orbital @xmath63 field , would then induce landau levels into the dirac spectrum .",
    "neglecting zeeman splitting , and in the absence of interactions would have a four - fold degenerate zeroth landau level , with an approximate su(4 ) symmetry as in single - layer graphene@xcite .",
    "however , the infinite density of states will generically cause interactions to remove this degeneracy and split the zeroth landau level , gapping out the spinons and allowing instantons to proliferate . the nature of the resulting broken symmetry state will depend on the manner in which the landau - level symmetry is broken , as different breakings of the su(4 ) symmetry result in different quantum hall responses ( e.g. quantum- spin , valley ,",
    "etc ... hall effects ) . within the dirac spin - liquid scenario ,",
    "such effects could possibly account for the field induced spin - freezing past a critical external field strength of a couple tesla , which has been observed in herbertsmithite through nmr measurements@xcite .",
    "moreover , this scenario could also be relevant in a weakly gapped @xmath0 spin - liquid scenario , where the @xmath0 state arises out of the dirac spin - liquid state by bcs pairing .",
    "in such a scenario , the minimal field required to induce spin - ordering could possibly be interpreted as @xmath298 for the spinon superconductor ( one would naively expect spinon superconductors formed by adding pairing to a @xmath18 spin - liquid to be strongly type-1 due to the large effective gauge - charge for the emergent gauge field ) .    at strong - magnetic fields",
    "where the zeeman - energy determines splitting of the lowest dirac landau - level , there will be a quantum spin - hall response@xcite , tying a spin - flip to each instanton insertion leading to a field - induced magnetically ordered state . at lower fields",
    ", alternative scenarios might occur@xcite .",
    "for example , if the zeroth landau - level splits by valley polarization , there will be a resulting quantum valley - hall effect .",
    "this would endow instantons with sub - lattice symmetry breaking quantum numbers ; and proliferating such instantons would result in a valence - bond crystal ( vbc ) state .",
    "this raises the possibility of a various sequences of continuous phase transitions as a function of field , for instance from dirac - spin - liquid to low - field vbc state , to a high - field magnetically ordered state .",
    "the emergent gauge electric field will also be altered by the presence of dm interactions . on symmetry grounds ,",
    "@xmath79 can receive contributions of order @xmath44 from operators like @xmath299 , which correspond to spin - current in the spinon theory .",
    "however , unlike the magnetic field case described above , it is difficult to externally couple to spin currents , so it is unclear whether these extra terms enable useful new probes .",
    "in this paper , we have used the strong - coupling @xmath20 expansion of bulaevskii et al.@xcite to incorporate virtual charge fluctuations into the effective spin - model description of the hubbard model .",
    "an alternative approach that was previously used in refs .  , is to work directly with the hubbard model using a slave - boson or slave - rotor effective theory .",
    "however , as we will show here , while qualitatively similar , the mean - field treatment of the slave - rotor theory does not capture the correct @xmath20 dependence of charge - excitations in a strong mott insulator . to show this fact , we begin by reviewing the slave - rotor framework and its predictions for the electromagnetic response of a u(1 ) spin - liquid mott insulating state .",
    "the slave - rotor approach begins by re - writing the physical electron operator at site @xmath22 and with spin @xmath94 as a product of a spin - less boson @xmath300 and spinful fermionic spinon @xmath301 : @xmath302 , subject to the constraint : @xmath303 .",
    "it is technically convenient to describe the boson as a u(1 ) quantum rotor : @xmath304 .",
    "this description suffers from a u(1 ) gauge redundancy corresponding to the local transformations : @xmath305 , @xmath306 . as a result",
    "the corresponding effective theory will contain a fluctuating compact u(1 ) gauge field , @xmath307 .    by a choice of gauge",
    ", one can associate the physical electron charge with @xmath63 , and a mott insulating state is then described by a charge gap @xmath308 for the bosonic rotor - excitations .",
    "the resulting low - energy effective theory reads : @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the physical electromagnetic field , @xmath38 is determined such that @xmath311 , and where we have treated @xmath300 as a soft - rotor by relaxing the rigid constraint @xmath312 .    the hopping amplitudes @xmath313 and @xmath314 can be estimated within a mean - field approximation : @xmath315 and @xmath316 . whereas @xmath317 independent of interaction strength @xmath12 , the spinon bandwidth decreases stronger interactions starting from @xmath318 in the vicinity of the mott transition ( @xmath319 ) , and reducing to @xmath320 for a strong mott insulator ( @xmath19 ) . in the large @xmath12 limit",
    ", we see that the slave - rotor effective action simply reproduces that of the schwinger fermion treatment of the heisenberg spin - model , without discarding the gapped charge fluctuations that enable non - zero optical conductivity .    here",
    "we see the first hint that the mean - field treatment of the slave - rotor theory does not quantitatively capture the dynamics of charge excitations : the mean - field treatment predicts that charge excitations propagate with effective mass @xmath321 , whereas , in a strong mott insulator one would expect strong coupling between spin fluctuations to enhance the holon mass to @xmath322.@xcite      the maxwell term for @xmath106 generated by integrating out the gapped boson fields in the slave - rotor action of eq .",
    "[ eq : slaverotormfaction ] , takes the form @xmath323 , where @xmath324 and @xmath325 are the emergent electric and magnetic fields respectively , and @xmath326 and @xmath38 are the corresponding dielectric constant and magnetic permeability",
    ".    we can compute the speed of emergent ` light ' , @xmath327 , within the slave - rotor theory for a strong mott insulator .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath326 can be determined by examining the action cost of a uniform electric field corresponding to @xmath328 , @xmath329 : @xmath330 where we have kept only the leading order contributions in @xmath20 and identified @xmath331 , as appropriate for a strong - mott insulator . in the first line",

    "this result identifies : @xmath335 .",
    "the magnetic permeability , @xmath38 is obtained from @xmath336 , which by gauge invariance is proportional to @xmath337 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to compute only the @xmath338 component : @xmath339}{\\left[}\\frac{\\omega^2+\\delta^2}{2u}+{\\varepsilon}_{k - q/2}{\\right ] } } -k_b^{ii}(0,0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding the denominator to @xmath340 gives : @xmath341}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx -12u^4q^lq^m{\\left[}\\sum_k { \\left(}v^i{\\right)}^2v^lv^m{\\right]}{\\left[}\\sum_\\omega\\frac{1}{{\\left(}\\omega^2+u^2{\\right)}^4}{\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term in the second line is the average of the band - mass over the full band , which vanishes , and @xmath342 is the velocity . for ( nearly ) isotropic bands , we can approximate the velocity average by @xmath343 , and we find that @xmath344 this gives : @xmath335 , and @xmath345 .",
    "combining these results gives : @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the bare fermi velocity corresponding to half - filling and hopping @xmath11 .",
    "again , in a strong mott insulator , one would expect the only relevant scale to be the spin - exchange @xmath17 , not @xmath11 , further fueling our suspicions that the slave - rotor mean - field is not sufficient for a quantitative description of charge dynamics .",
    "the physical electrical current is defined as the variation of the effective lagrangian density with respect to the electromagnetic vector potential : @xmath348 . following the previous section , the effective action for the emergent gauge field in the presence of an external physical electrical field , after integrating out the gapped boson fields takes the form : @xmath349 , which contains a linear coupling of the emergent and physical electric fields : @xmath350 , which",
    ", in the gauge where @xmath351 is equivalent to ( after integrating by parts ) : @xmath352 . meaning that the physical electrical current is : @xmath353 comparing to eq .",
    "[ eq : physicalemcurrent ] , we see that the slave - rotor theory is a factor of @xmath20 different than the strong - coupling expansion , which we attribute to the aforementioned shortcomings of the mean - field slave - rotor treatment of the gapped charge dynamics .",
