    "a large number of extensions of the sm predict the existence of color triplet particles carrying simultaneously leptonic and baryonic number , the so - called leptoquarks .",
    "leptoquarks are present in models that treat quarks and leptons on the same footing , such as composite models @xcite , grand unified theories @xcite , technicolor models @xcite , and superstring - inspired models @xcite .",
    "since leptoquarks are an undeniable signal for physics beyond the sm , there have been several direct searches for them in accelerators . at the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep ) , the experiments established a lower bound @xmath2@xmath3 gev for scalar leptoquarks @xcite . on the other hand , the search for scalar leptoquarks decaying into an electron - jet pair in @xmath4 colliders constrained their masses to be @xmath5 gev @xcite . furthermore , the experiments at the desy @xmath6 collider hera @xcite place limits on their masses and couplings , leading to @xmath7 gev depending on the leptoquark type and couplings .",
    "there have also been many studies of the possibility of observing leptoquarks in the future @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite colliders .    in this work",
    "we study the constraints on scalar leptoquarks that can be obtained from their contributions to the radiative corrections to the @xmath0 physics .",
    "we evaluated the one - loop contribution due to leptoquarks to all lep observables and made a global fit in order to extract the 95% confidence level limits on the leptoquarks masses and couplings @xcite .",
    "the most stringent limits are for leptoquarks that couple to the top quark .",
    "therefore , our results turn out to be complementary to the low energy bounds @xcite since these constrain more strongly first and second generation leptoquarks .",
    "the masses and couplings of leptoquarks are constrained by low - energy experiments , since the leptoquarks induce two - lepton  two - quark effective interactions , for energies much smaller than their masses @xcite .",
    "the processes that lead to strong limits are :    @xmath12 leptoquarks can give rise to flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes if they couple to more than one family of quarks or leptons @xcite . in order to avoid strong bounds from fcnc",
    ", we assumed that the leptoquarks couple to a single generation of quarks and a single one of leptons .",
    "however , due to mixing effects on the quark sector , there is still some amount of fcnc @xcite and , therefore , leptoquarks that couple to the first two generations of quarks must comply with some low - energy bounds @xcite .    @xmath12 the analyses of the decays of pseudoscalar mesons , like the pions , put stringent bounds on leptoquarks unless their coupling is chiral  that is , it is either left - handed or right - handed @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 leptoquarks that couple to the first family of quarks and leptons are strongly constrained by atomic parity violation @xcite . in this case , there is no choice of couplings that avoids the strong limits .",
    "it is interesting to keep in mind that the low - energy data constrain the masses of the first generation leptoquarks to be bigger than @xmath13@xmath14 tev when the coupling constants are equal to the electromagnetic coupling @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the bounds on scalars leptoquarks coming from low - energy and @xmath0 physics exclude large regions of the parameter space where the new collider experiments could search for these particles , however , not all of it @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , we should keep in mind that nothing substitutes the direct observation .",
    "a natural hypothesis for theories beyond the sm is that they exhibit the gauge symmetry @xmath1 above the symmetry breaking scale @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we imposed this symmetry on the leptoquark interactions . in order to avoid strong bounds",
    "coming from the proton lifetime experiments , we required baryon ( @xmath17 ) and lepton ( @xmath18 ) number conservation .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian for leptoquarks satisfying the above requirements and electric charge and color conservation is @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) stands for the left - handed quark ( lepton ) doublet , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the singlet components of the fermions .",

    "local invariance under @xmath1 implies that leptoquarks also couple to the electroweak gauge bosons . to obtain the couplings to @xmath34 , @xmath0 , and @xmath35",

    "moreover , we also verified explicitly that the leptoquarks decouple in the limit of large @xmath33 .",

    "these variables depend only upon the interaction of leptoquarks with the gauge bosons and it is easy to see that leptoquarks contribute only to @xmath107 . imposing that this contribution must be within the limits allowed by the lep data , we find out that the constraints coming from oblique corrections are less restrictive than the available experimental limits @xcite .",
