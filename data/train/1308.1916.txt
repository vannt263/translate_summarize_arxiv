    "another artifact due to the infinite - range of interactions in the model are the peculiar values @xmath204 ( _ i.e. _ no leading linear term for @xmath140 ) in the scaling of sr entropies , which are clearly not generic .",

    "when memory issues become problematic , a more judicious solution is provided by using associate arrays ( maps ) , with the key being the state bit representation of @xmath205 and the value @xmath206 . in memory sparse situations , we found it advantageous to use ` google::sparse_hash_map ` @xcite which is an associative array that uses a particularly high level of memory efficiency at the expense of computer time . each time a state @xmath205",
    "is observed , one can check whether it is already present in the map ( in which case the corresponding value is incremented by one ) or not ( in which case a new key is added to the map ) . in this way , only states that are actually observed are stored .",

    "note that this crucially depends on the sr entropy itself ( the larger @xmath8 , the more probabilities need to be stored ) . in the case where the memory limit is reached ,",
    "we dump the histogram to disk , and reset the map in memory before continuing the qmc simulation .",
    "once the simulation is finished , we add all histograms dumped into disk into a single histogram . in order to add histograms ( and to again avoid memory issues ) , we find very useful to save states to disk using the natural order of the state bit representation , such that one can directly write to disk ( without storing in memory ) the new histogram obtained by adding two histograms .",
    "once the final histogram is written to disk , entropies can be computed ( see below ) without reloading the full histogram in memory .",
    "_ choice of computational basis ",
    "_ if in the qmc simulation there is freedom in the choice of the computational basis , it is judicious to consider the basis that is computationally feasible and where the ground - state wave - function has the lowest entropy .",
    "for instance , for the transverse - field ising model , it is possible to perform simulations in the @xmath210  @xcite or @xmath118  @xcite basis , allowing to measure entropies @xmath211 and @xmath212 in the different basis . in one dimension , the two entropies are related by duality @xmath213 @xcite , and one can therefore choose the basis in which @xmath8 is the lowest for the specific values of @xmath90 simulated . note that at the critical point @xmath214 in one dimension , there is not much to be gained by changing the basis . in any dimension , it is easy to show that the following relation holds for all @xmath90 : @xmath215 we observe that in most of the phase diagram ( and especially close to the critical point @xmath216 ) for the square lattice , the sr entropies @xmath212 in the @xmath118 basis are much lower than in the @xmath210 basis  this explains why our results are shown in this basis .",
    "the same argument applies for the @xmath20 xy model , which can be simulated both in @xmath217 and @xmath218 basis  @xcite , the latter turning out to have lower sr entropies , as can easily be understood from the nature of the ground - state . for the xxx heisenberg model , sr entropies",
    "@xmath8 are obviously identical in the @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath217 bases as well as in all other bases linked by global su(2 ) transformations .",
    "_ conserved quantum numbers of the hamiltonian  _ if the ground - state wave - function belongs to a particular symmetry sector of the hamiltonian , it is useful to only perform measurements of @xmath76 in this sector .",
    "for instance , the ground - state of the transverse - field ising model ( with pbc ) belongs to the parity sector @xmath220 , _",
    "i.e. _ the eigenvalue 1 of the parity operator @xmath221 .",
    "when observed , a state @xmath205 is stored in the histogram only if it belongs to the sector @xmath220 .",
    "note that one needs to be able to easily check the symmetry sector of a state , which means that the symmetry operator needs to be _ diagonal _ in the computational basis .",
    "this is the case for @xmath222 in the transverse - field ising model when the @xmath118 basis is used . for the xxz model",
    ", one can easily compute the magnetization @xmath29 of the state , which is also a conserved quantity diagonal in the @xmath217 basis .",
    "this use of symmetry is useful for two reasons : ( i ) the temperature where the ground - state is reached is _ higher _ when the measurements are restricted to the ground - state symmetry sector : indeed the gap to the first excited state in the same sector is usually _ larger _ than the gap to the first excited state in another sector , ( ii ) less states need to be stored in the histogram , reducing its size . for the transverse - field ising model",
    ", this corresponds to a gain of a factor @xmath223 , and of a factor up to @xmath224 ^ 2 $ ] for the xxz model which is considerable .",
    "_ space group symmetries ",
    "_ states are also invariant under lattice symmetries .",
    "the use of the latter is usually more involved .",
    "the ground - state of interest is in most cases located in the most symmetric sector , which provides a huge gain in histogram size .",
    "we use the following technique to implement this symmetry : every time a state @xmath205 is encountered , we find its _ parent _",
    "@xmath225 , _ i.e. _ the state with the lowest bit representation which is equivalent to @xmath205 by symmetry . to find @xmath226",

    "we also store the degeneracy @xmath227 of the set ( the number of independent states generated in the process ) on disk as this will be needed for the final calculation of entropies .",
    "note that we find that storing the parent or its degeneracy for every state is too demanding in terms of memory , and we find it more efficient to recompute it each time .    for the square lattices with total number of sites @xmath18",
    ", the total number of symmetries is @xmath228 ( for regular clusters of size @xmath229 , or tilted clusters of size @xmath230 with @xmath39 integer ) or @xmath231 ( for other tilted clusters of shape @xmath232 with @xmath233 different integers ) , where the factor @xmath18 comes from translations and the factor @xmath234 or @xmath235 from independent rotations  @xcite .",
    "we find that the degeneracy @xmath236 is precisely equal to the number of symmetries of the cluster for most states @xmath205 , therefore we only save to disk the degeneracies @xmath227 when this is _ not _ the case .    imposing the space group symmetries",
    "improves very much the convergence of @xmath8 as not only much less memory is needed to store the histogram , but also much less measurements are needed ( in some sense , when one encounters a state @xmath205 , all symmetry - equivalent states are considered to be encountered , which speeds up the simulation ) .    _ imaginary time translation  _",
