    "there are many systematic properties of the dynamics of spiral galaxies which galaxy formation theory must explain .",
    "these include ( at least )    1 .   the luminosity  rotation velocity relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , 2 .",
    "the utility of maximum disk in high surface brightness galaxies ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ; sellwood 1999 ) , 3 .",
    "the surface brightness  enclosed mass - to - light ratio relation ( zwaan et al .",
    "1995 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) , 4 .   the luminosity  rotation curve shape relation ( rubin et al .",
    "1985 ; persic & salucci 1991 ) , 5 .   the mass discrepancy  acceleration relation ( sanders 1990 ; mcgaugh 1999 ) , and 6 .",
    "the mond ( milgrom 1983 ) phenomenology ( begeman et al .",
    "1991 ; sanders 1996 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1998 ) .",
    "the properties listed above are interrelated , and their meaning open to interpretation .",
    "i will attempt here to take an empirical approach illustrating the general requirements imposed on theory by the data .",
    "the relation between galaxy luminosity and line width is well known ( the tully - fisher relation ) .",
    "this important property ( 1 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    ".    common lore has it that the tully - fisher relation is a reflection of an underlying relation between total mass and rotation velocity . presumably , luminosity is closely proportional to total mass .",
    "if this is the case , it makes sense that for gas rich galaxies , a more appropriate quantity to plot than luminosity would be the sum of stellar and gaseous mass ( fig .",
    "it appears that the tully - fisher relation is indeed representative of a more fundamental relation between total baryonic mass and rotation velocity .",
    "this is consistent with the simple reasoning underpinning the standard picture , and would appear to be a success thereof .",
    "note , however , that this only follows if the baryon fraction is constant from galaxy to galaxy and the fraction @xmath0 of baryons which cool into disks is universal .",
    "while the first of these is certainly sensible , the second seems difficult to arrange unless @xmath1 . if not , there should be substantial scatter about the mean @xmath0 .",
    "this would propagate into the scatter in the tully - fisher relation whose error budget is already oversubscribed .",
    "however , @xmath2 is not currently expected in cdm models ( e.g. , steinmetz & navarro 1999 ) , and it may be necessary to vary @xmath0 in order to fit other constraints ( mo , these proceedings ) .",
    "in addition , the slope preferred by cdm is @xmath3 ( mo et al .",
    "1998 ) rather than the observed - band ( verheijen 1997 ) and the @xmath4-band ( sakai et al .  1999 ) . ]",
    "so there remain substantial hurdles to understanding the tully - fisher relation in the standard framework . the rigorous relation between total luminous mass and rotation velocity illustrated in fig .",
    "1 provides an important constraint on theory .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the disks of high surface brightness galaxies are maximal or nearly so ( e.g. , sellwood 1999 ) , while those of low surface brightness galaxies are not ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "maximum disk has , at the least , proven its utility ( property 2 ) in fitting the inner parts of the observed rotation curves of high surface brightness galaxies in considerable detail ( fig .",
    "the inference often drawn from this is that disks are indeed maximal and dark matter is only important at large radii  why else would the observed luminous mass so closely trace the dynamics ? indeed ,",
    "if high surface brightness disks are not maximal , there must be a peculiar conspiracy which causes the [ quasi - spherical ] dark matter halo to produce a rotation curve which has the same shape as that of the luminous disk .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 2 , and holds regardless of the dark matter fraction since subtracting a submaximal disk preserves the shape of the rotation curve .",
    "this is another indication of the strong link between dark and luminous mass over and above that already implied by the tully - fisher relation .",
    "standing in contrast to this is the large amount of dark matter enclosed by low surface brightness disks ( property 3 ) . as surface brightness decreases , so does the amplitude of the disk s contribution to the total rotation .",
    "yet the total amplitude of the rotation does not decrease , as illustrated by the lack of deviation from the tully - fisher relation ( fig .",
    "3 ) . consequently",
    ", low surface brightness galaxies must be dark matter dominated .",
    "it is possible that only the highest surface brightness disks are maximal , or that the utility of maximum disk is a fluke . on the other hand ,",
    "it is sometimes possible to force maximal disk fits to well resolved rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies ( swaters , private communication ) , albeit at the price of absurdly high stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this just creates another missing mass problem as we end up invoking dark matter in the disk rather than in a halo .",
    "a curious extension of the apparent contradiction between ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is the relation between luminosity and rotation curve shape ( 4 ) .",
    "the shape of a rotation curve is well predicted with knowledge of the luminosity and scale length of a galaxy : @xmath5 is pretty much the same at a given luminosity .",
    "moreover , rotation curve shape is well correlated with luminosity .",
    "bright galaxies have rapidly rising rotation curves ( measured in scale lengths ) while faint galaxies have slowly rising rotation curves .",
    "this provides an important test of galaxy formation theories , whose _ a priori _ predictions fail ( fig .",
    "another connection between the luminous and dark mass is evinced by the correlation of the amplitude of the mass discrepancy with centripetal acceleration ( property 5 ) . for @xmath6 m s@xmath7 , there is no perceptible mass discrepancy in spiral galaxies ( sanders 1990 ) .",
    "the luminous stars and gas suffice to explain the observed rotation for any reasonable choice of stellar mass - to - light ratio ( mcgaugh 1999 ) . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the severity of the mass discrepancy increases systematically with decreasing acceleration .",
    "the fact that there is this acceleration scale where dark matter is needed provides a constraint on halo parameters ( see also brada & milgrom 1999 ) . the maximum acceleration due to the halo , @xmath9 ,",
    "can not exceed the observed scale @xmath10 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath10 depends on the mass - to - light ratio of the stars .",
    "if @xmath11 is low , dark matter becomes important at slightly higher accelerations , and vice versa .",
    "since we must guestimate the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath12 is assumed ) , let us define the parameter @xmath13 to be the ratio of assumed to true stellar mass to light ratios ( mcgaugh 1999 ) .",
    "this is the one free parameter which can be adjusted to vary the effects of this limit .    as an example of the utility of this constraint ,",
    "consider the form of dark matter halos found in numerical simulations of structure formation ( for example , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; nfw ) .",
    "the maximum acceleration of an nfw halo occurs at @xmath14 . from the nfw expression for circular velocity ,",
    "the acceleration limit is @xmath15 this is shown in figure 5 for @xmath16 and 4 corresponding to true @xmath17 and  respectively .",
    "quite a lot of parameter space is disallowed unless we are prepared to consider @xmath18 .",
    "there are two ways of fitting the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies . in the context of dark matter",
    ", we subtract the observed luminous mass and attribute the remainder to dark matter .",
    "thus @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total rotation , @xmath21 is the component due to the stars , @xmath22 is that due to the gas , and @xmath23 is that of the halo .",
    "an equally successful procedure is offered by mond , which has no dark matter .",
    "the newtonian contributions of the luminous components are modified so that @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an arbitrary interpolation function with the asymptotic properties @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the total rotation in mond is thus related to the newtonian contributions of the luminous components through @xmath31.\\ ] ]    we can equate the two ( @xmath32 ) , and solve for the single variable which is not directly observed , @xmath23 : @xmath33\\ ] ] it is thus possible to uniquely express the mass distribution of the dark matter halo in terms of that of the luminous matter and a simple function of the observed centripetal acceleration .",
    "the only free parameter is @xmath13 , which allows for a difference between the true mass - to - light ratio and that required by mond .",
    "the fact that mond provides a phenomenological description of rotation curves imposes a very strong requirement on galaxy formation theories .",
    "if a theory is really to describe reality , it must predict the detailed distribution of all three mass components : stars , gas , and dark matter .",
    "one must then show that the predicted distributions satisfy the mond phenomenology : it should be possible to obtain a good mond fit to the model galaxy using only the luminous components .",
    "the only free parameter with which to do this is @xmath13 .",
    "there is no fudge factor associated with the gas distribution , and the freedom in the stars with @xmath13 is very limited since mond returns very reasonable mass - to - light ratios for stellar populations .",
    "this means @xmath34 .",
    "dark and luminous mass must be very strongly coupled indeed !",
    "there now exists a lengthy list of dynamical properties constraining theories of disk galaxy formation .",
    "these properties indicate a remarkably strong link between luminous and dark matter .",
    "no extant galaxy formation model passes all , or even most , of the tests posed by the observed properties .",
    "relatively straightforward models ( e.g. , dalcanton et al.1997 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; mo et al .  1998 ) require extensive tweaking ; so far only baby steps have been taken in this direction ( van den bosch , these proceedings ) .",
