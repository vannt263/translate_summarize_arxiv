    "human color vision is mediated by achromatic and opponent chromatic mechanisms with two fundamental properties  @xcite : ( i ) their response is nonlinear given some fixed observation conditions ( e.g. illuminant , spatial context , etc . ) ; and ( ii ) they are able to compensate changes in the observation conditions to keep the perception ( color ) of the objects constant despite the changes in the input . on the one hand , the nonlinear response of the mechanisms is revealed by the non - uniform nature of discrimination thresholds throughout the tristimulus space  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the adaptation ability of these mechanisms is revealed by asymmetric color matching experiments  @xcite : different physical inputs give rise to the same perception ( corresponding stimuli ) for equivalent shifts in the context .",
    "the standard empirical models of color vision assume that the system is formed by three linear photoreceptors sensitive to long , medium and short wavelengths ( lms ) .",
    "these models try to reproduce the above mentioned effects using three basic ingredients as reported in  @xcite : ( i ) context dependent weighting of the sensitivity of lms mechanisms , also known as von kries normalization , ( ii ) linear transform to an opponent color space , and ( iii ) nonlinear saturation of the achromatic and the opponent - chromatic responses .    following",
    "the classical suggestion by barlow on the relation between image statistics and neural behavior @xcite , a large body of literature argues that mechanisms underlying the perception of object colors are organized according to the statistical regularities of the signals confronted by the sensory systems .",
    "however , very often , the proposed statistical approaches deal with color discrimination and color constancy in a _ separated way _ : they are not able to address both adaptation and nonlinearities jointly .",
    "on the one hand , linear approaches based on decorrelation ( linear principal component analysis , pca ) and higher order redundancy removal ( linear independent component analysis , ica ) explain the existence of spectrally opponent chromatic channels with the right spatial sensitivity .",
    "the seminal work of buchsbaum and gottschalk  @xcite derives opponent channels from pca applied to lms signals subject to a rough model of natural radiances ( white noise ) .",
    "atick et al .",
    "@xcite derive the achromatic and chromatic contrast sensitivity functions using decorrelation arguments constrained with error minimization and an idealized model of spatio - spectral radiances .",
    "ruderman et al .",
    "@xcite obtain fourier - like spatio - chromatic opponent sensors using pca on the lms signals obtained from real reflectance measurements .",
    "wachtler et al .",
    "@xcite apply linear ica pixel - wise and patchwise on real hyperspectral photographic images and obtain better coding results than using pca .",
    "doi et al .",
    "@xcite use pca and ica to derive spatio - chromatic properties of the lateral geniculate nucleus ( lgn ) and the primary visual cortex ( v1 ) .",
    "even though the above techniques do not explicitly address adaptation , webster and mollon  @xcite show that the mean shift ( or chromatic adaptation ) , and the covariance shift ( or contrast adaptation ) can be roughly reproduced by dimension - wise normalization of the lms responses , and pca followed by whitening using the set of adaptation colors under different illuminants .",
    "their work combines an extension of the measurements reported in  @xcite ( which used single - color adaptation ) with the decorrelation - oriented explanation given by atick et al .",
    "the obvious problem with linear methods is that they can not explain non - uniform discrimination , i.e. the nonlinear response .    on the other hand , color discrimination and the associated nonlinearities",
    "have been statistically addressed from a different point of view . in this case , the key is the consideration of the limited resolution of any physical sensor and its optimal design to deal with non - uniformly distributed signals .",
    "two different criteria have been proposed in this context .",
    "first , laughlin @xcite argued that limited resolution mechanisms should be designed to maximize the information transfer ( _ infomax _ approach ) . in noise - free scenarios , the _ infomax _ principle leads to component independence and nonlinear responses related to the marginal probability density functions ( pdfs ) @xcite .",
    "second , macleod et al .",
    "proposed that , in order to minimize the representation error in the presence of neural noise ( _ error minimization _ approach ) , the response of the color sensors should be related to some power of the marginal pdfs in the color opponent directions  @xcite .",
    "the same reasoning has been applied to explain physiological nonlinearities at the lgn  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in these studies , an explicit multidimensional data - driven algorithm to get the optimal set of sensors remained unaddressed : in their experiments they just showed marginal pdfs in predefined linear axes  @xcite . and more importantly",
    ", no attempt has been made to explain adaptation using _ infomax _ or _",
    "error minimization_. again , just one of the aspects , the nonlinear behavior , was addressed by these techniques .    among the statistically inspired approaches ,",
    "a remarkable exception to the separate consideration of color discrimination and adaptation is the work by abrams et al .",
    "@xcite , where the authors investigate whether optimizing the nonlinearity is compatible with optimal color constancy or adaptation . in that case",
    "the presented model already has the appropriate _ parametric formulation _ inherited from the empirical models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be argued that , even though the model was statistically fitted , the expected behavior is somehow imposed in advance through the use of a convenient functional form . according to this ,",
    "it is not shown that the empirical behavior emerges directly from data , but the ( also interesting ) fact that the empirical models may be statistically optimal in color discrimination and adaptation at the same time .",
    "finally , we should that many of the above statistical studies rely on _ simplified databases_. in particular , most of the works dealing with adaptation to changes in the illuminant usually assume that the input radiance is just the product of the spectral reflectance and the illuminant radiance : they assume flat lambertian surfaces .",
    "therefore , relevant nonlinear phenomena in the image formation process , such as mutual illumination in rough surfaces , are neglected .    in this work ,",
    "we address the _ simultaneous _ explanation of ( i ) the nonlinear behavior of achromatic and chromatic mechanisms in a fixed adaptation state ; and ( ii ) the change of such behavior , i.e. adaptation , under the change of observation conditions .",
    "this is done by proposing a single non - parametric method based on principal curves ( pcs ) @xcite : the sequential principal curves analysis ( spca ) .",
    "the method exploits the flexibility of pcs to find adaptive ( eventually non - linear ) sensors .",
    "moreover , spca is equipped with tunable local metric so that the proposed analysis may follow either the _ infomax _ or the _ error minimization _ principles .",
    "given the fact that psychophysical adaptation data are given under d65 and a illuminations @xcite , in this work , the statistical analysis is made on a _ new database _ consisting of colorimetrically calibrated images of natural objects under these calibrated illuminations .",
    "spca reproduces the psychophysical behavior on color discrimination thresholds , discount of the illuminant and corresponding pairs in asymmetric color matching .",
    "these color vision properties are demonstrated to emerge directly from realistic data regularities without assuming any _ a priori _ functional form .",
    "moreover , the results suggest that color perception at this low abstraction level may follow an error minimization strategy , as suggested by macleod  @xcite , instead of the information maximization principle suggested in laughlin  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ motivation ] motivates the statistical study of color vision by reviewing ( i ) the basic features of color pdfs and their changes , and ( ii ) the non - linear and adaptive nature of color vision mechanisms .",
    "section [ learning ] reviews the results on _ infomax _ and _ error minimization _ in _ unsupervised manifold learning_. this motivates our computational approach , which is presented in section [ generalspca ] : the sequential principal curves analysis ( spca ) with local metric .",
    "section [ setup ] describes the design of the experiments : the database of calibrated natural color images used and how the simulation of color vision phenomena from spca is carried out .",
    "section [ nonlinear_results ] shows how the proposed statistical technique simultaneously reproduces experimental data on color discrimination and adaptation , compares its performance with empirical color appearance models ( cielab , llab , ciecam ) , and discusses the biological implications of the results .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] presents the conclusions of the work .",
    "this section motivates the problem of characterizing nonlinearities and adaptation of the color vision mechanisms .",
    "first , we review the special characteristics of the color manifolds .",
    "then , the considered perception phenomena are reviewed through two sets of results : ( i ) the nonlinear behavior of achromatic and opponent chromatic mechanisms  @xcite ; and ( ii ) the ability to compensate changes in spectral illumination according to experiments on corresponding colors  @xcite .",
    "observation of the natural world gives rise to measurements that typically live in low dimensional manifolds .",
    "the shape of these manifolds and its pdf depend on the interesting features of the underlying phenomenon .",
    "for example , in vision , it is known that the spectral reflectance of objects is intrinsically low dimensional  @xcite . moreover , the physical constraints on the reflectance as well as the geometry of the surfaces give rise to particular statistics of the tristimulus values  @xcite .",
    "however , these distributions are also modified by additional , eventually non - interesting , causes  @xcite : both mutual illumination in surfaces of complex geometry and changes in the spectral illumination and its geometry introduce nonlinear changes in the pdf of the tristimulus values that are difficult to characterize .",
    "the examples in fig .",
    "[ real_example ] show real ( top ) and synthetic ( bottom ) examples of the nonlinear nature of changes in color distributions , which clearly can not be compensated by linear transforms .",
    "top panel in figure  [ real_example ] illustrates the basic features of the tristimulus pdf in natural scenes and its changes :    * the distribution is remarkably non - uniform , i.e. densely populated around the color direction determined by the illuminant , and of decreasing density for higher saturation values ( see lms distribution ) . *",
    "it displays a strong correlation between the lms values . *",
    "different illumination geometry gives rise to different data distribution along the principal axes .",
    "in particular , the highlighted regions differ in the illumination angle : the scene illuminated with d65 ( a ) is relatively more populated in the high ( low ) luminance region .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "interestingly , the results show that both spca strategies ( _ error minimization _ and _ infomax _ ) qualitatively reproduce the trends in both aspects of the phenomenology .",
    "spca gives rise to nonlinear responses in the atd directions that shift in the appropriate way when changing the adaptation environment from white to reddish illumination .",
    "moreover , spca qualitatively reproduces the shift in the corresponding colors and the orientation of chroma circles , both in the cie d65 from cie a data and viceversa .",
    "this general behavior comes from the fact that the proposed algorithm follows the changes in the pdfs , and has increased resolution , higher sensitivity , in the more populated regions ( as illustrated in the example of fig .",
    "[ gamba ] ) .",
    "note that the minima in the thresholds in the t and d axes ( figs .",
    "[ spca_results_tercio ] and [ spca_results ] , top row ) coincide with the corresponding maximum in each pdf ( fig .",
    "[ data_exp1 ] ) .    [ [ discussion . ] ] discussion .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    the proposed statistical explanation is more general than previous statistical approaches only focused on one of the two phenomena . on the one hand ,",
    "pca - based approaches such as  @xcite do reproduce the shift and scaling of luo et al . corresponding colors ( results not shown ) , but their linear nature implies that they can not reproduce the nonlinearities in atd . we did not check the performance of more recent linear - ica - based approaches such as  @xcite in reproducing corresponding colors , but in any case , they inherently suffer from the same limitation with regard to the weber s law and the chromatic nonlinearities . on the other hand , laughlin and macleod et al .",
    "certainly introduced strategies to account for the nonlinearities  @xcite but they did not explicitly propose a multidimensional transform to perform the analysis , so their ideas can not be used to straightforwardly derive the corresponding colors dataset .",
    "the performance of our non - analytic technique is consistent with the general conclusions found by abrams et al .",
    "@xcite where discrimination and color constancy are simultaneously considered .",
    "they found that analytic models based on von - kries adaptation , color opponent transforms and dimension - wise nonlinearities can be simultaneously optimal in discrimination and adaptation under spectral illumination changes , but not when the reflectance ensemble is substantially changed .",
    "here we did not try to address the optimality of the proposed technique in terms of roc as in  @xcite , but it is obvious by the construction of spca that compensation of observation conditions is not going to be possible for our technique if the objects giving rise to the different adaptation ensembles are very different from each other .",
    "our technique needs wide enough reflectance ensembles for a proper adaptation : if one tristimulus manifold comes from a wide set of objects while the other comes from a ( restricted ) set of , say , mainly reddish objects , the manifolds do not qualitatively match , so color compensation results are not going to be accurate . in abrams et al .",
    "terms , a different set of parameters ( a different mechanism ) is needed in this situation .",
    "our results represent a data - driven alternative to abrams et al .",
    "approach since , in our case , no analytic model is assumed in advance .",
    "here , the nonlinear and adaptive behavior ( and its limitations ) strictly emerge from data , and not from a statistically fitted model with a particularly convenient functional form .",
    "an additional issue is answering to the question of what optimality criterion is using the brain in encoding color information at this ( low ) abstraction level . in this respect , _ with the considered color image database _ , better agreement with the experimental data is obtained using the _ error minimization _ strategy . as expected from its design , the _ infomax _ principle gives rise to steeper nonlinear responses , while the experimental nonlinearities ( and the _ error minimization _",
    "solutions ) are smoother . better reproduction of corresponding pairs is also obtained with the _ error minimization _ strategy .",
    "these results seem to favor the macleod suggestions on _ error minimization _ in front of the _ infomax _ principle .    a possible objection to such preliminary conclusion",
    "would be related to its dependence on the particular dataset .",
    "note that the steepness of the statistically derived chromatic responses depends on the relative concentration around the achromatic axis in the considered database : if the database would be strongly biased towards achromatic objects , the higher concentration around the achromatic axis would favor the _ error minimization _ strategy . and the other way around for a database of highly saturated objects .",
    "even though we subscribe the dependence of the results on the database , it does not seem that our database is particularly biased towards achromatic objects ( cf .",
    "[ database ] ) .",
    "in fact , neglecting the cluster towards saturated green ( due to over representation of plants ) , the curved cluster visible in the ciexy diagram under d65 is quite consistent with the theoretical predictions in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the database does not seem to be specifically favoring the _ error minimization _ strategy .",
    "nevertheless , given the practical impossibility of achieving a truly unbiased database  @xcite , the definitive way to confirm these suggestions on the optimality strategy is extending the webster and mollon s measures  @xcite performing both color discrimination and corresponding - pairs experiments in which observers are adapted to the same ( controlled ) statistics as the ones used in the numerical simulations .",
    "recent experiments in color discrimination seem to follow this direction  @xcite . in such experiments ,",
    "the analysis we proposed here could be used to obtain some insight into the question of the particular optimality criterion applied by the brain in these tasks .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the basic features of color vision sensors , namely their nonlinearities , the variation of their response under change of adaptation conditions , and their ability to compensate for the changes in spectral illumination emerge from the description of the manifolds of tristimulus values of natural objects under different illuminations . to this end",
    ", we have proposed a new nonlinear manifold description technique , the sequential principal curves analysis with local metric .",
    "spca is better suited to the color statistics problem than previous manifold description techniques since it is readily invertible and can be easily tuned for the _ infomax _ or the _ error minimization _ principles by simply selecting the appropriate population - dependent metric .",
    "in addition , a new accurate color image database has been collected that could be eventually used for further accurate experiments on color constancy and chromatic adaptation .",
    "the proposed technique generalizes previous statistical explanations of color perception that just account for a subset of the data  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also generalizes the results in  @xcite , which simultaneously analyze discrimination and adaptation , because we do not assume an explicit functional form of the model . consistently with the results of abrams et al . on the performance of statistically fitted analytic models",
    "@xcite , the proposed non - parametric technique also requires similarity between the reflectance ensembles for an accurate color adaptation .",
    "the simulation of perceptual results with the considered image database suggests that color vision mechanisms may be guided by an _ error minimization _ strategy .",
    "however , in order to confirm this conjecture , new psychophysical data are required in which the observers discrimination and adaptation is determined by particular statistics . in that case , spca could be applied to obtain some insight about the goal used by the brain in encoding color information .",
