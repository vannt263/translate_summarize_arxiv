    "the importance and complexity of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) phenomenon in manganites , the incredible drop in the resistivity with the onset of the magnetic order and/or under external magnetic field @xcite , do not require to be emphasized once again .",
    "the mechanism of this fascinating phenomenon remains uncertain despite the elaborated theoretical studies , see reviews @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the most common features of these materials is the semiconductor - like behavior of resistivity above the magnetic ordering temperature @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have revisited an apparently oversimplified model that roots in 1970th ; in addition to this model s history ( see references in @xcite ) we have traced it back to @xcite ( 1972 ) and @xcite(1969 ) .",
    "its approach is naive : if an object behaves as a semiconductor above the magnetic ordering temperature ",
    "treat it as a true semiconductor and consider effect of the magnetic ordering. nevertheless this model demonstrates a good semiquantitative agreement with the cmr behavior in @xmath0 ref.@xcite .    in this work we are going to demonstrate that this ancient and naive model is consistent with the characteristic behavior of the various cmr manganites .",
    "as in @xcite , we consider the simplest semiconductor with parabolic density of states in the conducting band and activation energy @xmath1 , see fig.1a .",
    "the local electrons responsible for the magnetic ordering form the local magnetic levels ( depicted by inscription and bold - dashed line ) that define the fermi energy @xmath2 . both @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    "are assumed independent on temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic and conducting electrons are considered separately and assumed to be tied only by magnetic exchange between them .",
    "it means that the occurrence of the magnetic order results in the nonzero weiss quasi - field @xmath3 applied to the conducting electrons .",
    "we expect @xmath3 to be proportional to the local magnetization @xmath4 , either spontaneous and/or field - induced .",
    "external field @xmath5 is expected to be much smaller than @xmath6 , while @xmath6 might depend strongly on @xmath5 , especially in the vicinity of the curie temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this effective field causes the shift of the spin - up and spin - down conducting bands by @xmath8 down and up respectively , see fig.1b .",
    "the condition @xmath9 corresponds to the closure of the gap and hence to the crossover from the semiconductor to the half - metal , sketched on fig.1c .",
    "the density of thermally activated carriers @xmath10 in this model is described by expression from ref.@xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a numerical coefficient , first integral corresponds to spin - up band and second to the spin - down one .",
    "the typical dependences of @xmath10 on @xmath3 at different temperatures calculated with eq.1 are presented in fig.2 .",
    "application of weiss field always causes the increase in the number of carriers , i.e. decrease in resistivity . note that the crossover from semiconductor to half - metal at @xmath13 , marked by dotted line , is not pronounced even at @xmath14 several times smaller than @xmath1 .    in fig.3 .",
    "we present the simulation of zero - field temperature dependences of resistivity @xmath15 , supposedly proportional to @xmath16 obtained using eq.(1 ) .",
    "weiss field @xmath6 is assumed strictly proportional to the spontaneous magnetization : @xmath17 ; we set realistic values @xmath7=200k and @xmath1=700k , employ the same dependence @xmath18 ( inset fig.3 ) for all the dependences and vary only the strength of the weiss field @xmath6 , governed by @xmath19 parameter .",
    "its values are listed over the curves .",
    "the resulting temperature dependences look credible , resembling typical experimental dependences @xmath15 for various cmr materials .",
    "as a next step we reverse the approach and try to obtain the suggested weiss field from the experimental @xmath20 dependences .",
    "the obvious problem is the contribution of the unknown carriers mobility @xmath21 to the resistivity . in this analysis",
    "we always set @xmath22 that appeared to be sufficient .",
    "hence the final equation is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a numerical coefficient ( includes mobility , carriers effective mass and so on ) .",
    "the procedure is as follows : first we fit the high - temperature paramagnetic fragment of the experimental @xmath15 dependence by eq.(2 ) with @xmath3 set equal to zero , i.e. by ordinary expression for the nonmagnetic semiconductor .",
    "typically this fit is good enough .",
    "obtained @xmath1 and @xmath24 values are the only adjustable parameters of the model .",
    "since that the procedure is unambiguous : we solve the eq .",
    "( 2 ) numerically for the each experimental @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath5 values using the same @xmath1 and @xmath24 , obtaining therefore the @xmath27 dependence .",
    "we use_mathematica 6 _ package for the calculations .",
    "note that there are no adjustable parameters related to magnetism at all .",
    "according to the model this dependence is expected to follow the characteristic behavior of the local magnetization @xmath28 , the supposed source of @xmath6 .",
    "we have analyzed this way various cmr manganites using experimental data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "all the results are in general agreement with each other . here",
    "we present the most conclusive outcome obtained with the data ref.@xcite , the detailed study of @xmath29 system where @xmath15 dependences cover more than 4 decimal orders of magnitude , and ref.@xcite with @xmath15 dependences in @xmath30 at various magnetic fields .",
    "we also present analysis of the data ref.@xcite for @xmath31 and ref.@xcite for @xmath32 with the step - like magnetic phase transition .",
    "fig.4 presents @xmath33 dependences for @xmath29 ceramics at various @xmath34 , calculated from data fig.1 ref.@xcite with activation energy @xmath1=1400k for all the data .",
    "the @xmath33 dependence for @xmath35 ( dashed line , guide for the eye ) resembles nicely typical @xmath36 behavior ( compare inset fig.3 . ) all the dependences for @xmath37 follow the same dashed line scaled properly vertically and horizontally .",
    "the deflection at @xmath38 is due to the broadening of the knee in @xmath15 near @xmath7 with @xmath34 increase , see original fig.1 ref.@xcite . therefore not only obtained @xmath33 dependences are credible , but also strength of the weiss field declines slightly but regularly with @xmath34 increase , as could be expected .",
    "the @xmath33 isofield dependences for polycrystalline @xmath30 are presented on fig.5 ; data from fig.4 .",
    "we obtain a regular behavior that is fully consistent with the @xmath39 dependences in the typical ferromagnet under magnetic field : increase in @xmath5 always causes increase in @xmath6 , @xmath6 is almost field independent well below @xmath7 but depends on @xmath5 strongly in the vicinity of @xmath7 ; @xmath6 depends on @xmath5 roughly linearly well above @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the dependence for @xmath405 t even follows the curie - weiss dependence at @xmath41 , see inset fig.5 .",
    "the similar result have been obtained for @xmath42 , fig.7 .",
    "ref.@xcite ( not presented ) .",
    "ref.@xcite allows to compare the calculated weiss field with the experimental magnetization in @xmath32 ceramics where magnetic transition is step - like .",
    "on fig.6 we present the zero - field @xmath33 dependence ( left scale ) obtained with eq.(2 ) from fig.2 ref.@xcite ( curve co 5% , h=0 ) with the experimental fc magnetization @xmath39 measured in field @xmath401.45 t ( right scale ) .",
    "these two dependences behave in a quite similar way .",
    "note that the applied field shifts the magnetic transition in this substance to higher temperatures @xcite , that is why the @xmath39 dependence is shifted right  otherwise it would match almost exactly .    data for @xmath31 single crystal from fig.2 ref.@xcite also allow direct comparison of the calculated @xmath6 with the experimentally measured magnetization in various magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic phase transition in this substance is first - order and the associated drop in resistivity exceeds 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "on fig.7 we compare the @xmath43 isofield dependences calculated from resistivity data fig.2(b ) ref.@xcite by the same procedure as before ( left scale ) and the isofield imagnetization @xmath39 fig.2(a ) ref.@xcite ( right scale ) .",
    "the @xmath1=1200k value , obtained from @xmath400 dependence , is the same for all the data . vertical scales adjusted to obtain the best match .",
    "we see that the calculated @xmath43 dependences for @xmath403 t and @xmath404 t follow nicely the experimental @xmath39 curves at the same field values .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good taking into account the uncertainty in carriers mobility .",
    "it looks like the change in carriers concentration under magnetic ordering is so huge that the simultaneous change in mobility is negligible in comparison .",
    "therefore all the examined experimental data appear to be consistent with the model .",
    "the hypothetical weiss field always behaves in the same style as the local magnetization  its suggested source .",
    "certainly the demonstrated agreement and consistency , while undeniable , are insufficient to admit this model .    the obvious problem of the model is the value of the calculated @xmath44k that exceeds @xmath7 several times .",
    "taken literally it means that the exchange between a thermally activated carrier and a magnetic spin is several times stronger than the exchange between these spins responsible for the very magnetic ordering .",
    "it favors the formation of magnetic polarons @xcite instead of the lone thermally activated carriers .",
    "moreover the suggested gap @xmath1 is most likely a pseudogap @xcite .",
    "we even can not rule out that the model provides reasonable results only due to some coincidence .",
    "nevertheless we hope that the demonstrated consistency with the most magnetotransport features of the various cmr manganites as well as the transparency of the model are convincing enough to draw attention to this approach .",
    "in conclusion , we consider a classical semiconductor affected by the hypothetical weiss exchange field that arises from the magnetic order .",
    "this is likely the most straightforward approach to the rearrangement of the band structure with the onset of magnetic order .",
    "the results obtained in this phenomenological model give a credible description of the resistive and magnetoresistive properties of cmr manganites .",
    "the weiss field refined from the experimental data behaves with temperature and external magnetic field in the same style as the local magnetization , the suggested source of this weiss field .",
    "therefore this oversimplified and naive model nevertheless deserves attention ."
