    "recently , the atlas collaboration has released the new results for the inclusive searches for events with a same - sign dilepton by using the 20.3  fb@xmath1 data at the 8  tev run of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "they improve the previous results based on the 4.7  fb@xmath1 data at the 7  tev run  @xcite . from non - observation of any excess from the standard model ( sm ) background , upper limits at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) on the fiducial cross section",
    "have been obtained for inclusive production of the same - sign dilepton from the non - sm contribution .",
    "one of the most interesting applications of these results is to obtain a constraint on the parameter space for physics related to doubly charged higgs bosons @xmath0 . in various exotic models beyond the sm , @xmath0",
    "are predicted its existence , e.g. , in the left - right symmetric model  @xcite , in models with the type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite , and in neutrino mass models via quantum effects  @xcite . in this letter , we focus on @xmath0 in the higgs triplet model  ( htm )  @xcite , where the higgs sector is composed of an isospin doublet higgs field with the hypercharge @xmath2 and a triplet field with @xmath3 . in the htm ,",
    "two decay modes are allowed for @xmath0 , i.e. , decays into the same - sign dilepton and the same - sign diboson .",
    "are heavier than singly charged scalar bosons @xmath4 , @xmath0 can also decay into @xmath5  @xcite . ]",
    "if the same - sign dilepton decay is dominant , the most stringent lower limit on the mass of @xmath0 @xmath6 has been obtained to be about 550 gev  @xcite at the lhc .",
    "on the other hand , searches for @xmath0 in the same - sign diboson decay mode are of distinct importance .",
    "the detection of interactions to weak gauge bosons can probe that @xmath0 come from higgs fields with a non - trivial isospin charge .",
    "when the same - sign diboson decay is dominant , the mass bound given in the above is no longer applied . in our previous publications",
    "@xcite , we have performed analyses to obtain the mass bound of @xmath0 in the diboson decay scenario in the htm . by using the results on the inclusive searches for events with a same - sign dilepton at the lhc  @xcite ,",

    "events which contain a same - sign dilepton have been collected with the selection cuts of ( i ) @xmath8  gev for the leading transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) lepton , ( ii ) @xmath10  gev for the sub - leading @xmath9 lepton , ( iii ) @xmath11 for both leptons where @xmath12 represents the pseudorapidity and ( iv ) an invariant mass cut of @xmath13  gev . to reduce background from @xmath14",
    "boson decays , ( v ) events with an opposite - sign same - flavor dilepton whose invariant mass satisfies @xmath15  gev are rejected .",
    "in addition , in the @xmath16 channel , ( vi ) events with a same - sign dielectron in the mass range between 70  gev and 110  gev are vetoed to use events in this region as a control sample to estimate the sm background .",
    "total numbers of the collected events and invariant mass distributions are in good agreement with the prediction by the sm , and therefore upper limits on the cross section from the non - sm contribution are obtained for the fiducial region defined above .",
    "the experimental limits on the fiducial cross section can be compared with the theoretical prediction calculated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is ( sum of ) the total cross section times branching ratio for the process giving the same - sign dilepton signal from the new physics model , and @xmath19 is the factor of efficiencies of the acceptance and kinematical cuts .",
    "we evaluate the fiducial cross section for the process with the same - sign dimuon , @xmath20 , in the final state via @xmath21 in the htm .",
    "the other channels , such as @xmath16 and @xmath22 turn out to give weaker bounds than the @xmath20 channel . in the following discussion",
