    "since the launch of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , astronomers have frequently used far - infrared emission to trace star formation in extragalactic sources .",
    "far - infrared emission has been very popular to use for estimating star formation rates because it is not as strongly affected by dust extinction as ultraviolet and optical tracers of star formation and because many surveys , particularly surveys of high - redshift sources , have detected a multitude of galaxies in the far - infrared .",
    "several equations have been derived to calculate star formation rates either from far - infrared measurements by themselves or from far - infrared data combined with optical or ultraviolet data @xcite . while it is commonly assumed in the use of these equations that dust is primarily if not solely heated by star forming regions , the heating source for the dust producing far - infrared emission has been widely debated for decades . following the completion of the iras surveys",
    ", several papers showed that iras 60 and 100  @xmath0 m emission was strongly correlated with star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others argued that a significant fraction of dust emission originated from dust heated by evolved stars ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , analyses performed by @xcite and @xcite on iras data combined with 160 or 170  @xmath0 m data from the kuiper airborne observatory indicated that emission at @xmath1100  @xmath0 m also originated from dust heated by star formation .",
    "later observations of nearby spiral galaxies with the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite demonstrated that optical and ultraviolet star formation tracers were very strongly correlated with 24  @xmath0 m dust emission @xcite or with total infrared emission @xcite .",
    "however , similar analyses showed that the correlation between optical / ultraviolet star formation tracers and either 70 or 160  @xmath0 m emission was weaker @xcite , which implied that not all of the far - infrared emission originated from dust heated by star formation .",
    "additionally , @xcite demonstrated that large scale 160  @xmath0 m emission from m33 qualitatively appeared more similar to large scale k - band emission than to large scale h@xmath3 , 24  @xmath0 m , or 70  @xmath0 m emission , implying that the dust emitting at 160  @xmath0 m was at least partly heated by the evolved stellar population .",
    "furthermore , some dust models applied to iras , infrared space observatory @xcite , _ spitzer _ , and ground - based submillimetre data for nearby galaxies have suggested that heating by evolved stars was needed to reproduce the observed spectral energy distributions for these galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the first results from the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite brought attention back to this issue mainly because the telescope provided data at longer wavelengths than what had been provided by either iras or _",
    "spitzer _ and at a higher signal - to - noise than what was possible with ground - based instrumentation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that colours between 160 and 500  @xmath0 m in m81 , an sab galaxy @xcite , were more strongly dependent on galactocentric radius than on far - infrared surface brightness , which implies that the dust was heated primarily by the evolved stars in the galaxy ( which have a surface brightness that varies primarily with radius ) rather than by star forming regions ( which are primarily found in the infrared - bright regions ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite found that 100 - 250  @xmath0 m emission from compact sources in m33 , an scd galaxy @xcite , were strongly correlated with star formation as measured using h@xmath3 emission , 24  @xmath0 m emission , or a combination of the two .",
    "the goal of this paper is to follow - up these early _ herschel _ results using three nearby face - on spiral galaxies with differing hubble types taken from the very nearby galaxies survey , a _",
    "herschel _ guaranteed - time photometric and spectroscopic survey of 13 galaxies with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; * ? ? ? * ) and spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we will primarily compare surface brightness ratios between two _ herschel _ bands to both stellar surface brightness and to star formation rate .",
    "surface brightnesses measured in single bands may be correlated to star formation through dust heating , in which the dust is heated by the star forming regions and becomes more luminous , or through the schmidt law @xcite , in which star formation is correlated to the amount of dust present . in contrast ,",
    "surface brightness ratios are advantageous to use in that they are largely independent of the total dust surface density . instead",
    ", surface brightness ratios will primarily depend only on the average temperature of the dust emitting at those wavelengths , with temperature variations caused either by variations in the amount of a warmer dust component relative to a colder dust component or variations in the overall temperature of a single dust component .",
    "this is similar to the approach used by @xcite , but the advantage of the analysis in this paper is that we will not rely upon galactocentric radius as a proxy for the surface brightness of the evolved stellar population and that we will use a better tracer of star formation .",
    "section  [ s_sample ] describes the three galaxies in our sample ( m81 , m83 , and ngc  2403 ) and why they are well - suited for this analysis .",
    "section  [ s_data ] provides an overview of the data from _ herschel _ and from other sources as well as details on the preparation of the data for the analysis .",
    "the analysis itself is presented in section  [ s_analysis ] , the implications of the results is discussed in section  [ s_discussion ] , and a summary is provided in section  [ s_conclusions ] .",
    "as stated above , the three galaxies used for this analysis were all galaxies selected from the very nearby galaxies survey ( pi : c. wilson ) , a guaranteed - time survey of 13 well - studied nearby galaxies with a diverse range of properties .",
    "the galaxies for the analysis in this paper were selected because they are all spiral galaxies with inclinations of @xmath4 from face - on , they have optical discs larger than 10  arcmin , and they are at distances of less than 5  mpc , so sub - kpc structures can be easily studied within the galaxies .",
    "the galaxies are also roughly representative of early- , mid- , and late type spiral galaxies .",
    "details on the three galaxies used in this analysis are given in table  [ t_sample ] .",
    "the images used in the analysis are shown in figures  [ f_map_ngc3031]-[f_map_ngc2403 ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath5 these parameters correspond to the ones in equation  [ e_efinal ] .",
    "+ @xmath6 the units of @xmath7 are ( erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 arcsec@xmath10 ) ( mjy sr@xmath9)@xmath9",
    ". + @xmath11 this is relative fraction of dust heating from star forming regions as given by equation  [ e_efrac ] .",
    "the value is calculated with the data for all 36  arcsec square regions used when fitting equation  [ e_efinal ] to the data .",
    "+ @xmath12 these are correlation coefficients for the relations between the right and left sides of equation  [ e_efinal ] .",
    "+ @xmath13 these fits were performed excluding the central @xmath14 36  arcsec square regions .",
    "see the text for details .",
    "+ @xmath15 instead of reporting the result from the fit to equation  [ e_efit ] here , we instead report the result of the fit of a power law relation between the 70/160  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratio and the h@xmath3 intensity .",
    "see the text for details .",
    "+    we encountered two problems with fitting equation  [ e_efit ] to the data . in fitting the 70/160  @xmath0 m surface brightness data for m83 , we found that the difference between the ratio and the resulting fit was significantly high around the nucleus , and the reconstructed colour temperature map in figure  [ f_mapfrac_ngc5236 ] did not look like the observed colour temperature map .",
    "additionally , the fractional contribution of star formation to dust heating seemed abnormally low ; when the nucleus is included , the fractional contribution of star formation to dust heating is @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that the nucleus does not follow the same 70/160  @xmath0 m dust heating relation as the rest of the disc , for reasons that are unclear but that could be related to hot ( @xmath17  k ) dust heated by the nuclear starburst that is visible in the 70  @xmath0 m band .",
    "therefore , we excluded the central @xmath14 regions ( @xmath18  arcsec ) of m83 for the analysis on the 70/160  @xmath0 m ratio .",
    "( excluding the same central region when fitting equation  [ e_efit ] to the 160/250 , 250/350 , or 350/500  @xmath0 m data did not affect the fits signficantly . ) in fitting equation  [ e_efit ] to the 70/160  @xmath0 m data for ngc  2403 , we found that the @xmath19 term was negligible compared to the @xmath20 term , which caused convergance problems when trying to perform a nonlinear least squares fit .",
    "we therefore report results in which the 70/160  @xmath0 m ratio is a function of only the h@xmath3 intensities ( which is consistent with the interpretation that variations in dust heating traced by this ratio depend primarily on star formation ) .    after dealing with these two exceptions ,",
    "the resulting fits are generally very good .",
    "the correlation coefficients in table  [ t_colorvsmult ] for the relations between the logarithm of the surface brightness ratios and the expression on the right side of equation  [ e_efinal ] are generally higher than the corresponding correlation coefficients in either tables  [ t_colorvsstar ] or [ t_colorvsha ] for fits to either the 1.6  @xmath0 m or h@xmath3 emission , although in many cases , the improvement in the correlation coefficients is marginal .",
    "moreover , most correlation coefficients in table  [ t_colorvsmult ] are above 0.7 , indicating that at least 50% of the variance in the data can be accounted for by the relations .",
    "the only exceptions are the 70/160  @xmath0 m ratio for ngc  2403 , which we identified as problematic up above , and the 350/500  @xmath0 m ratio for m83 , which is very noisy in general .",
    "the reconstructed colour temperature maps based on equation  [ e_efinal ] in figures  [ f_mapfrac_ngc3031]-[f_mapfrac_ngc2403 ] look qualitatively similar to the colour temperature maps based on the observed surface brightness ratios .",
    "the reconstructed maps generally match the overall radial gradients in temperature seen in many of the observed maps , and the reconstructed maps also show that we could reproduce the colour temperatures of many of the individual star forming regions within the spiral structures of each galaxy .",
    "however , the temperatures of the reconstructed star forming regions do not always precisely match the colour temperatures in the observed map .",
    "this could be because of variable extinction among individual star forming regions , which could cause the relation between star formation ( as traced by h@xmath3 emission ) and dust heating to vary .",
    "we also occasionally see some residual structures in temperature that show features that are not quite described by the reconstructed map . in m81",
    ", the nucleus ( excluded from the fits ) appears notably cold in the residual maps because of the synchrotron emission from the agn .",
    "the nucleus of m83 , which caused problems in the fits and was excluded , appears as a hot spot in the residual 70/160  @xmath0 m map .",
    "residual spiral structure is seen in the 160/250  @xmath0 m and 250/350  @xmath0 m residual maps , which could be indicative of dust heating gradients across the spiral arms that are inadequately described by equation  [ e_efinal ] and show the limitations of using this approach to reproducing dust colour temperature variations .",
    "foyle et al .",
    "( in preparation ) found a similar offset between dust temperatures and star formation in the spiral arms . finally , we see residual structure in the 70/160  @xmath0 m map of ngc  2403 that is clearly a result of latent image effects in the 70  @xmath0 m data .",
    "the main purpose of these fits was to determine the relative contributions of star forming regions and the total stellar populations to dust heating .",
    "the results in table  [ t_colorvsmult ] generally show a decrease in the relative contribution of dust heating from star formation as wavelength increases . in m83 and ngc 2403",
    ", star forming regions contribute @xmath21% of the total heating of the dust traced by the @xmath22  @xmath0 m bands , although in m81 , the dust heating up to 70  @xmath0 m appears to still be dominated by the total stellar population . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the relative contribution of star forming regions decreases signficantly .",
    "star forming regions appear to contribute only @xmath23% of the energy for heating the dust traced by the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m bands in all three galaxies .",
    "the relation for the 350/500  @xmath0 m ratio for ngc  2403 seems anomalous in that it implies that @xmath24% of the energy for the dust heating originates from star forming regions , which is higher than what is implied by the fit to the 250/350  @xmath0 m ratio for that galaxy .",
    "however , we suspect that this is because the 350/500  @xmath0 m data are on the rayleigh - jeans side of the sed and are strongly affected by noise .",
    "hence , colour variations related to dust heating are not detected at a high signal - to - noise level in ngc  2403 , and so the methods we are using may not be effective in this one case .",
    "overall , the results here are consistent with the interpretations we have provided for the results in sections  [ s_analysis_stars ] and [ s_analysis_sf ] . at wavelengths shorter than 160  @xmath0 m , most of the dust appears to be heated by star forming regions in these galaxies , which is why the 70/160  @xmath0 m ratios appear more closely dependent on the h@xmath3 surface brightnesses . at",
    "wavelengths longer than 250  @xmath0 m , the dust appears to be primarily heated by the total stellar populations , and so the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m ratios are more strongly related to the 1.6  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "the results here have demonstrated that the total stellar population , including evolved stars and not just stars in star forming regions , plays a significant role in heating dust in nearby galaxies .",
    "the fraction of observed dust emission that is heated by the total stellar population varies as a function of the wavelength . while star forming regions are the dominant heating source for dust observed at @xmath25  @xmath0 m , the total stellar population , including evolved stars , become the dominant heating source for the dust observed at @xmath26  @xmath0 m .",
    "we have been able to demonstrate that dust is heated by the total stellar populations in spite of the fact that the dust emission itself tends to be correlated with h@xmath3 emission , which should bias our results towards finding dust heated by star formation .",
    "moreover , we have shown that significant dust heating by the total stellar population can be seen even in late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "the results here validate the original conclusions drawn from iras data by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as well as the conclusions drawn from _ spitzer _",
    "data by @xcite and @xcite that evolved stellar populations play an increasingly important role in heating dust towards longer infrared wavelengths .",
    "additionally , the differences between the results for m81 , where we were able to demonstrate that the bulge stars were heating dust even at 70  @xmath0 m , and the results for ngc  2403 , where the dust emitting at 70  @xmath0 m did not appear to be influenced at all by the bulge stars , corroborates results from @xcite , who found that bulges influenced dust heating in nearby galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the results here corroborate the findings from radiative transfer models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as other dust emission models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that had suggested that dust absoprtion and emission can only be accurately modelled if it contains a dust component heated by star formation and a dust component heated by the total stellar population .",
    "both our results and the radiative transfer analyses suggest that the @xmath25  @xmath0 m emission originates from dust that is heated by star forming regions located within clouds ( or clumps ) that are optically thick at ultraviolet and blue wavelengths . in these models ,",
    "only a relatively small fraction of the dust is heated by the star forming regions , but the dust appears significantly brighter than the dust outside the centres of the regions , leading to higher 70/160  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratios in these regions .",
    "most of the dust mass in the ism , however , is shielded from the ultraviolet and blue photons from the star forming regions .",
    "this dust is heated by the diffuse interstellar radiation field , which would include light from evolved stars , and has lower temperatures .",
    "none the less , because a much greater fraction of the dust mass is heated this way , the colder dust is the predominant source of emission at @xmath26  @xmath0 m .",
    "also , if the mean free path of light in the diffuse interstellar medium is similar to or smaller than the resolution elements in our analysis , the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m ratios can be expected to be very well correlated with the stellar surface brightnesses in those resolution elements .",
    "the v - band optical depths and the dust vertical scale heights derived in the analyses of edge - on galaxies by @xcite and @xcite imply that the mean free paths of v - band photons through the discs of spiral galaxies should be roughly between 0.1 and 1  kpc . in comparison ,",
    "the binned data that we used correspond to physical sizes of @xmath27 - 800  pc , and so the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m ratios should be very well correlated with tracers of the total stellar population in these binned data , which is exactly what we see .",
    "while we do produce observational results that are generally consistent with many previously - published dust models , we do find a inconsistency when comparing our results for m81 and ngc  2403 with the dust models for these specific galaxies from @xcite .",
    "@xcite did predict from their sed fitting to m81 that most of the dust emission at @xmath28  @xmath0 m is from a diffuse component , which is largely consistent with the results from our surface brightness ratio variations .",
    "however , their sed fitting to ngc  2403 also predicted that most of the dust emission at @xmath28  @xmath0 m from that galaxy was from diffuse dust , whereas the surface brightness variations we observed imply that the star forming regions should be the predominant heating source at @xmath25  @xmath0 m .",
    "this demonstrates that , while the general ideas being applied in dust models are still valid , further refinement is needed if the models are not only going to replicate the overall seds of galaxies but also replicate colour variations within the galaxies .    even though many authors have argued that a significant fraction of the dust in nearby spiral galaxies is heated by evolved stellar populations , other authors have shown that total infrared dust emission can be correlated with star formation in nearby spiral galaxies @xcite , and even some of the early results from _ herschel _ suggest that emission in individual wave bands ( i.e. the 100 , 160 , and 250  @xmath0 m bands ) can be correlated with other star formation tracers in m33 @xcite , a galaxy with the same hubble type as ngc  2403 .",
    "we think the apparent contradictions between the correlations between far - infrared emission and star formation found by other authors and the relation between dust heating and the total stellar populations that we find can be explained in two ways .",
    "first of all , some of the correlations between far - infrared emission and star formation are based on either the far - infrared fluxes traced by the iras 60 - 100  @xmath0 m data or on the total dust emission as computed from the _ spitzer _ 24 - 160  @xmath0 m bands , both of which strongly sample emission from dust on the wien side of the thermal dust emission in a regime where we also found that star formation strongly influenced dust heating .",
    "moreover , iras - based studies simply did not have data at @xmath1100  @xmath0 m wavelengths , which we found were dominated by emission from dust heated by the total stellar population .",
    "second , it is possible that far - infrared emission could be linked to star formation indirectly through the schmidt law @xcite rather than directly through dust heating .",
    "dust emission at far - infrared wavelengths is a function of both dust temperature and dust surface density . since dust",
    "should implicitly be a tracer of the total surface density of gas in the interstellar medium , and since the schmidt law suggests that star formation is a function of the amount of gas available to fuel it , we expect dust emission to be correlated with star formation to some degree even if the dust is not directly heated by the star formation .",
    "the dust colours , however , are strongly affected by dust temperature but are independent of dust surface density and therefore will depend more on dust heating sources than the emission observed in a single wave band .",
    "this is probably why we are able to show that far - infrared surface brightness in the 250 - 500  @xmath0 m bands is correlated with h@xmath3 intensity even though we have demonstrated that the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratios are more strongly correlated with 1.6  @xmath0 m surface brightness .",
    "additionally , in the case of m81 , the 1.6  @xmath0 m emission is poorly correlated with the 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath0 m surface brightness , and yet the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m ratios are clearly being heated mostly by the stellar population traced by the 1.6  @xmath0 m band . in this case",
    "the infrared surface brightness can only be correlated with the h@xmath3 emission if the dust surface density is correlated with the star formation surface density .",
    "we believe that this may also be a possible reason why @xcite and @xcite can show that the 100 - 250  @xmath0 m emission is correlated with h@xmath3 and 24  @xmath0 m emission , although a comparison of the infrared colour variations in m33 to tracers of star formation or the total stellar population would be needed to confirm this .    aside from the use of surface brightness ratios instead of surface brightnesses or flux densities in our analysis",
    ", we think that the choice of galaxies that we used in this analysis was critical to demonstrating that the total stellar populations ( including evolved stars ) play a significant role in dust heating .",
    "m81 and ngc  2403 are both special in that the stellar emission traces different structures than either the dust emission or the star formation .",
    "this has been critically important for allowing us to disentangle the relative contributions from the two different heating sources .",
    "m83 is a good example of a `` typical '' spiral galaxy in which the starlight , dust emission , and star formation all trace similar structures .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that it is difficult to disentangle whether the total stellar population or star formation is a greater contributor to dust heating in such cases .",
    "other authors working with m83 or similar galaxies will probably encounter similar problems .",
    "we emphasize that we have only found that these results apply to spiral galaxies .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the 250/500  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratio depends on 24  @xmath0 m surface brightness in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  6822 , thus demonstrating that the dust emitting at submillimetre wavelengths was significantly affected by star forming regions .",
    "this is probably a result of the galaxy containing relatively few evolved stars that could heat dust , although it is conceivable that , in the low metallicity environment , the interstellar medium would contain less dust , and so diffuse dust would be less shielded from star forming regions .",
    "we anticipate that similar results would be obtained for other dwarf irregular galaxies with ongoing star formation .",
    "in contrast , we may expect that the @xmath170  @xmath0 m emission seen in elliptical galaxies ( when the elliptical galaxies produce any far - infrared emission at all ) will originate from dust predominantly heated by evolved stars , just as the dust from the central 3  kpc of m81 appears to be heated primarily by evolved stars .",
    "how our results for spiral galaxies apply to luminous infrared galaxies ( with total infrared luminosities between @xmath29 and @xmath30 l@xmath31 ) and ultraluminous galaxies ( with total infrared luminosities above @xmath30 l@xmath31 ) is unclear , as the galaxies contain strong star formation and agn emission but also have large stellar populations and may have large reservoirs of dust that is shielded from the star forming and agn regions .",
    "additional analyses on the dust heating mechanisms in these classes of galaxies is warranted .",
    "for m81 , m83 , and ngc  2403 , we have demonstrated that the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratios are more strongly correlated with 1.6  @xmath0 m emission , which traces the starlight from the total stellar populations including evolved stars , than with h@xmath3 emission from star - forming regions . at shorter wavelengths , the total stellar population may continue to be influential in dust heating , particularly in early - type spiral galaxy m81 , but heating by star formation becomes more important , particularly in the late - type spiral galaxy ngc  2403 . none the less ,",
    "these results imply that , in each of these galaxies as well as other spiral galaxies in general , the total stellar populations are a significant if not dominant heating source for the dust observed at @xmath1160  @xmath0 m in all spiral galaxies , including late - type spiral galaxies . in some cases , virtually all of the emission may originate from dust heated by the total stellar populations , including evolved stars in the bulges and discs .",
    "the results here have strong implications for modeling dust in spiral galaxies .",
    "first of all , dust models need to include separate thermal components for the dust heated by star forming regions and dust heated by the total stellar populations . when fitting single modified blackbodies to data , it may be inappropriate to force the function to fit 70  @xmath0 m or shorter wavelength data , particularly by varying the index of the power law that describes the dust emissivity ( see , for example , @xcite , but also note the additional analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "models based on more complex dust physics need to include components heated by red stellar radiation fields that only become predominant at longer wavelengths , as is already done in some cases , and these models also need to be tuned so that they replicate not only the global seds of galaxies but also the colour variations within galaxies .",
    "template - based sed models need to include an additional component based on dust heated by a quiescent stellar population , as is done by @xcite , although these cold dust templates should be calibrated using observations of nearby galaxies where the dust emission can be studied on kpc scales rather than inferred from observations of unresolved sources .",
    "also , dust extinction corrections that rely upon infrared flux to estimate extinction corrections , as is commonly done for ultraviolet data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , need to account for dust heating by evolved stellar populations and not just star forming regions , as is also suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we are going to suggest caution when using far - infrared emission as a star formation tracer for both nearby and more distant galaxies .",
    "dust emission in individual wave bands at @xmath1160  @xmath0 m is probably related to star formation indirectly through the schmidt law rather than directly through dust heating .",
    "using , for example , 250  @xmath0 m flux density measurements to determine star formation rates is akin to using co measurements to determine star formation rates .",
    "while this may still be an accurate way to measure star formation rates under certain circumstances , it will be necessary to understand the caveats that affect such analyses .",

    "<S> we use _ spitzer _ space telescope and _ herschel _ space observatory far - infrared data along with ground - based optical and near - infrared data to understand how dust heating in the nearby face - on spiral galaxies m81 , m83 , and ngc 2403 is affected by the starlight from all stars and by the radiation from star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 70/160  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratios tend to be more strongly influenced by star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the 250/350  @xmath0 m and 350/500  @xmath0 m surface brightness ratios are more strongly affected by the light from the total stellar populations , suggesting that the dust emission at @xmath1250  @xmath0 m originates predominantly from a component that is colder than the dust seen at @xmath2160  @xmath0 m and that is relatively unaffected by star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by discussing the implications of this for modelling the spectral energy distributions of both nearby and more distant galaxies and for using far - infrared dust emission to trace star formation .    </S>",
