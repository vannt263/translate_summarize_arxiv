    "statistical properties of eigenvalues of random matrices have been extensively studied for decades , stemming from the seminal work of wigner  @xcite . random matrix theory ( rmt )",
    "has successfully provided tools and methods to disparate areas of physics and mathematics  @xcite , with countless applications so far .",
    "statistics of several random variables associated with random eigenvalues have been studied extensively .",
    "this includes the length of a gap in the eigenvalue spectra , number of eigenvalues in a given interval , the largest eigenvalue , the trace etc .",
    "most studies concerned with the probability of _ typical _ fluctuation of such a random variable around its mean .    however , various recent applications of random matrix theory have posed questions regarding _ atypical _ large fluctuations of such random variables associated with the eigenvalues , thus triggering a number of recent studies on the large deviation probabilities of such random variables .",
    "this includes , for instance , the large deviation probability of the extreme ( maximum and minimum ) eigenvalues of gaussian  @xcite and wishart random matrices  @xcite , of the number of stationary points of random gaussian landscapes  @xcite , of the distribution of free energies in mean - field spin glass models  @xcite , of the conductance and shot noise power in chaotic mesoscopic cavities  @xcite , of the entanglement entropy of a pure random state of a bipartite quantum system  @xcite and of the mutual information in multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) channels  @xcite .",
    "in addition , random matrix theory has been used to understand large deviation properties of various observables in the so called vicious walker ( or nonintersecting brownian motion ) problem  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the large deviation properties of another natural random variable for large gaussian matrices , namely the fraction @xmath18 of positive eigenvalues of an @xmath1 gaussian matrix .",
    "part of the main results presented here were announced in a recent letter  @xcite .",
    "we will explain shortly why this fraction @xmath18 is a natural observable that arises in a number of physical situations .",
    "but before we do that , it is useful to recall some well - known facts about gaussian matrices .",
    "there are three families of gaussian random matrices with real spectrum : orthogonal ( goe ) , unitary ( gue ) and symplectic ( gse ) .",
    "the @xmath1 matrices belonging to these families are real symmetric , complex hermitian and quaternion self - dual respectively , whose entries are independent gaussian variables ( real , complex or quaternions ) labeled by the dyson index @xmath19 respectively . the probability distribution of the entries of a matrix @xmath20 is then given by the gaussian weight : @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the inner product on the space of matrices invariant under orthogonal , unitary and symplectic transformation respectively .",
    "explicitly , one has : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes hermitian conjugation and @xmath25 the quaternion self - dual .",
    "the celebrated result by wigner states that for large matrix size @xmath2 , the average density of eigenvalues ( all real ) for such ensembles has a @xmath6-independent semicircular form  @xcite @xmath26^{1/2}\\ ] ] which vanishes identically at the two edges @xmath27 and is normalized to unity .",
    "clearly , the mean spacing between eigenvalues in the bulk , i.e. , close to the origin , behaves for large @xmath2 as @xmath28 .",
    "a natural and much studied question that goes back to dyson  @xcite is : how many eigenvalues are there in a given interval @xmath29 $ ] on the real line ?",
    "clearly this number @xmath30}$ ] is a random variable that fluctuates from one sample to another .",
    "its mean value , for large @xmath2 , is easy to compute by integrating the semi - circular average density in over the interval @xmath29 $ ] : @xmath31}\\rangle = n \\int_a^b \\rho_{\\rm   { sc}}(\\lambda , n ) d\\lambda$ ] . but",
    "how does this number fluctuate from one sample to another ?",
    "dyson studied this number fluctuation in the so called bulk limit , i.e. , he focused on a small symmetric interval around the origin @xmath32 $ ] where @xmath33 is the mean bulk spacing and @xmath34 is kept fixed while one takes the @xmath35 limit .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the number of eigenvalues in this interval . clearly , the mean number of eigenvalues @xmath37 .",
    "but dyson also computed the variance of @xmath36 in the large @xmath2 limit ( with @xmath34 fixed ) and showed that for large @xmath34 the variance grows logarithmically with @xmath34 @xmath38 and the constant @xmath39 was computed by dyson and mehta  @xcite .",
    "thus the _ typical _ fluctuations of @xmath40 grow as @xmath41 for large @xmath34 . more recently ,",
    "even the higher moments of @xmath36 ( in the @xmath42 limit with @xmath34 fixed ) were computed which proved that on a scale of @xmath41 around the mean @xmath34 , the random variable @xmath36 has a gaussian distribution  @xcite .    here",
    "our focus will be on a different limit , namely we study the statistics of the number of eigenvalues , not on a small symmetric interval around the origin ( i.e , the bulk limit ) , but rather on the full unbounded interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "in other words , we are interested simply in the distribution of the number of positive eigenvalues @xmath44 ( called the index ) of a gaussian random matrix @xmath20 .",
    "since the average density of states is symmetric in @xmath45 , it is clear that on average there are @xmath46 positive eigenvalues .",
    "clearly the index @xmath44 fluctuates from one realization of the matrix to another and in this paper , we are precisely interested in the fluctuation properties of the random variable @xmath44 , i.e. , in the full probability distribution @xmath47 . evidently , @xmath48",
    "also , the number of negative eigenvalues @xmath49 is distributed identically as the number of positive eigenvalues @xmath44 by virtue of the gaussian symmetry , indicating @xmath50 .",
    "hence the distribution @xmath51 of @xmath44 is clearly symmetric around its mean value @xmath52 .",
    "it thus suffices to study the range @xmath53 .",
    "so , why are we interested in this index distribution ?",
    "this question naturally arises in the study of the stability patterns associated with a multidimensional potential landscape @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the context of glassy systems , the point @xmath55 represents a configuration of the system and @xmath56 is just the energy of the configuration  @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the context of disordered systems or spin glasses , @xmath56 may represent the free energy landscape .",
    "in the context of string theory , @xmath57 may represent the potential associated with a moduli space  @xcite .",
    "typically such an @xmath2-dimensional landscape has many stationary points ( minima , maxima and saddles ) with complex stability patterns that play an important role both in statics and dynamics of such systems  @xcite .",
    "the stability of a stationary point of this @xmath2-dimensional landscape is decided by the @xmath2 real eigenvalues of the @xmath58 hessian matrix @xmath59 $ ] which is symmetric .",
    "if all the eigenvalues are positive ( negative ) , the stationary point is a local minimum ( local maximum ) .",
    "if some , but not all , are positive then the stationary point is a saddle .",
    "the number of positive eigenvalues ( the index ) , @xmath60 , is then a key object that determines in how many directions the stationary point is stable . given a random potential @xmath57 , the entries of the hessian matrix at a stationary point are usually correlated .",
    "however , in many situations , important insights can be obtained by ignoring these correlations and just assuming the entries of the hessian matrix are just independent gaussian variables .",
    "this then leads to the study of the statistics of index for a goe matrix .",
    "this toy model , called the random hessian model ( rhm ) , has been studied extensively in the context of disordered systems  @xcite , landscape based string theory  @xcite and also in quantum cosmology  @xcite .",
    "although in rhm @xmath61 , it is quite natural to study the index distribution for other gaussian ensembles , namely for gue ( @xmath12 ) and gse ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "for the goe ( @xmath61 ) , the statistics of @xmath3 was studied by cavagna _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using supersymmetric replica methods and some additional approximations .",
    "they argued that around its mean value @xmath63 , the random variable @xmath3 has _",
    "typical _ fluctuations of @xmath64 for large @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the distribution of these typical fluctuations is gaussian . in other words , over a region of width @xmath65 , the distribution for large @xmath2 is given by  @xcite @xmath66       \\label{gauss1}\\ ] ] implying that for @xmath61 , @xmath67 for large @xmath2 .    on the other hand",
    ", this gaussian form does not describe the _ atypically _ large fluctuations of @xmath44 .",
    "for example , in the extreme limit when @xmath68 , the probability that all eigenvalues are positive @xmath69 was computed recently for large @xmath2 and for all @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath70 ;   \\quad \\theta=\\frac{1}{4}\\log(3 ) .",
    "\\label{dm1}\\ ] ] this question of the probability of extreme large fluctuation of @xmath3 ( fluctuation on a scale @xmath71 around its mean @xmath63 ) naturally came up in several recent contexts such as in landscape based string theory  @xcite , quantum cosmology  @xcite and in the distribution of the number of minima of a random polynomial @xcite .",
    "these two rather different forms of the distribution @xmath72 in the two limits , namely in the vicinity of @xmath73 ( over a scale of @xmath65 ) ( as in ) and when @xmath74 ( as in ) raise an interesting question : what is the form of the distribution @xmath75 for intermediate values of @xmath76 ?",
    "in other words , how does one interpolate between the limits of _ typically _ small and _ atypically _ large fluctuations ? to answer this question",
    ", it is natural to set @xmath77 where the intensive variable @xmath78 denotes the fraction of positive eigenvalues and study the large @xmath2 limit of the distribution @xmath79 with @xmath18 fixed .",

    "the fact that the logarithm of the probability is @xmath89 for fixed @xmath18 is quite natural , as it represents the free energy of an associated coulomb fluid of @xmath2 charges ( eigenvalues ) ( to be discussed in detail later ) .",
    "the coulomb energy of @xmath2 charges clearly scales as @xmath89 . in the limit @xmath90",
    ", we get @xmath91 in agreement with ( [ dm1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution is thus highly non - gaussian near its tails . in the opposite limit @xmath92",
    ", we find a marginally quadratic behavior , modulated by a logarithmic singularity @xmath93 setting @xmath94 and substituting this form in , we find that in the vicinity of @xmath95 and over a scale of @xmath65 , indeed one recovers the gaussian distribution @xmath96 \\label{gauss10}\\ ] ] thus proving that the variance @xmath97 for large @xmath2 and for all @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to obtaining the full distribution @xmath98 of the fraction of positive eigenvalues @xmath18 , our coulomb gas approach also provides a new method of finding solutions to singular integral equation with two disconnected supports , as discussed in detail later .",
    "this method is rather general and can be fruitfully applied to other related problems in rmt , an example is later provided in the paper in calculating the probability that an interval @xmath17 $ ] is free of eigenvalues , i.e. , there is a gap @xmath17 $ ] in the spectrum .",
    "the details of these calculations are somewhat involved and were not presented in our previous letter  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide these details which we believe will be important for other problems as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii.a we set up the problem and show that the rate function can be computed via the solution of a singular integral equation on a disconnected support . in subsections ii.b and ii.c , we provide two different strategies to find such a solution , the first based on a scalar riemann - hilbert ansatz and the second based on an iterated application of a theorem by tricomi . in subsection ii.d we derive the free energy of the associated coulomb gas and the large deviation function @xmath7 associated with the index distribution . in subsection",
    "ii.e we provide an asymptotic analysis of @xmath7 near @xmath9 and determine the variance of the index for large matrix size @xmath2 . in section iii we provide details of numerical simulations . as an application of the general method for solving two - support integral equation , we compute in section iv , the probability that a gaussian random matrix has a gap @xmath17 $ ] in the spectrum . in section",
    "v we offer a derivation of a determinantal formula for the variance of the index at finite @xmath2 for @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary in section vi .",
    "we consider the standard gaussian ensembles of random matrices with dyson index @xmath19 , corresponding to real , complex and quaternion entries respectively .",
    "the probability distribution of the entries is given in and consequently the joint probability density of eigenvalues reads  @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the normalization constant which can be explicitly computed via a selberg - like integral  @xcite and to leading order for large @xmath2 , @xmath101 where @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "we wish to compute the probability distribution @xmath103 of the index @xmath44 , defined as the number of positive eigenvalues of the @xmath1 matrix @xmath20 : @xmath104    by definition : @xmath105 we will set @xmath77 where @xmath83 is the fraction of positive eigenvalues . as mentioned in the introduction , due to the gaussian symmetry , the number of positive eigenvalues @xmath44 will have the same distribution as the number of negative eigenvalues @xmath49 .",
    "hence , @xmath106 ( the distribution is symmetric around @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to focus only on the range @xmath87 .",

    "we can identify @xmath109 s as the coordinates of the charges of a @xmath110-d fluid confined on the real axis .",
    "the charges repel each other via the @xmath110-d logarithmic coulomb potential and are confined by a quadratic external potential .",
    "then @xmath111 is the energy of this coulomb gas .",

    "the eigenvalues become rather dense and one can then take a continuum limit where one replaces the integration over the discrete eigenvalues by a functional integral over the density of these eigenvalues",
    ". originally introduced by dyson  @xcite , this procedure ( see also  @xcite ) has recently been successfully used in a number of different contexts .",
    "these include the computation of the extreme eigenvalue distribution of gaussian  @xcite and wishart random matrices  @xcite , counting the number of stationary points of random gaussian landscapes  @xcite , and computing the distribution of the bipartite quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this method has also been used recently in systems such as nonintersecting fluctuating interfaces in presence of a substrate  @xcite , in computing the distribution of conductance and shot noise power in mesoscopic cavities  @xcite and in the study of multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) channels  @xcite .",
    "dyson s prescription requires first a coarse - graining procedure , where one sums over ( partial tracing ) all microscopic configurations of @xmath109 s compatible with a fixed charge density function @xmath115 .",
    "secondly , one performs a functional integral over all possible positive charge densities @xmath116 normalized to unity .",
    "finally the functional integral is carried out in the large @xmath2 limit by the saddle point method .    following this prescription ,",
