    "anisotropic flow was one of the most expected results from heavy - ion program at the lhc .",
    "the very first measurements have shown that the anisotropic flow at lhc is large and in rough agreement with expectation from the hydrodynamic model .",
    "these results have been intensively discussed at the last quark matter conference  @xcite and have been published  @xcite , but did not reduce the interest in flow results , as new questions have risen up , in particular the ones related to the initial geometry fluctuations .",
    "also , high - energy and high - multiplicity , as well high - statistics data from lhc allow for unprecedented study of event anisotropies at high transverse momenta as well as precision measurements of multiparticle ( higher cumulants ) correlations . identified particle flow , for which the alice experiment  @xcite is suited the best among all lhc experiments , is also highly interesting as it provides important information for further understanding of the system evolution ( e.g. development of radial flow ) as well as hadronization process .",
    "below we discuss new alice results related to these questions .",
    "the results on elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2-mesons , and muons from heavy flavor decays can be found in  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the charge dependence of the azimuthal correlations , and in particular in correlations with respect to the reaction plane has attracted a lot of attention , first as a measurement sensitive to the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite , but also due to its sensitivity to the system hadronization and , more generally , to the system evolution till the freeze - out , e.g. charge ( quark ) production and charge diffusion in the system during its evolution .",
    "alice collaboration measurements  @xcite of the charge dependent correlations are consistent with the ( mostly qualitative ) expectations from the cme . at the same time the same data",
    "would be consistent with the effect of the local charge conservation in combination with the large elliptic flow .",
    "alice is performing measurements which should allow to clarify the picture .",
    "some of those are discussed in these proceedings .    finally , we review alice preliminary results using a new technique , the so - called event shape engineering  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to select events of a particular shape , either more asymmetric or more `` round '' , the direction to be very promising in many respects . in this study",
    "we address such questions as the role of event shape fluctuations on flow at large transverse momenta .",
    "the results are in agreement with results obtained with other methods , in particular comparing 4-particle cumulant results with event plane and 2-particle cumulant measurements .",
    "recently , alice has submitted the paper  @xcite extending its anisotropic flow measurements up to @xmath3  gev / c .",
    "the nonflow effects in this analysis has been suppressed by using the event plane from the vzero detectors separated from the tpc by two units of rapidity with an estimate of remaining nonflow included in the systematic error . along with elliptic flow ,",
    "alice reported results on triangular flow @xmath4 and fourth harmonic anisotropy measured with respect to both second and fourth order event planes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the difference between the two is totally due to fluctuations in the fourth order harmonic flow and as such provides important constraints on the physics and origin of the flow fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ fig : pteta ] shows the results for the charge particle anisotropies . results for pions and protons has been also measured ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "significant nonzero elliptic flow as well as @xmath4 were found up to the highest transverse momenta . at @xmath7  gev/@xmath8",

    "alice results agree well with such a scaling . more details of this analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the @xmath13-differential anisotropic flow suggests an existence of several regions in the transverse momentum space with distinctly different underlying physics .",
    "it is now widely accepted that at @xmath142 gev/@xmath8  the flow pattern is mostly determined by hydrodynamical flow exhibiting typical `` mass splitting ''  @xcite . at large transverse momenta , @xmath7  gev/@xmath8 ,",

    "one would expect very little particle type dependence in this region , but unfortunately there exists no calculations for that .",
    "the intermediate @xmath13 region is less understood .",
    "it has been observed that in this region all baryons have similar flow which differs from meson flow approximately in a 3:2 ratio .",
    "such a scaling finds a natural explanation in the quark coalescence picture , the so - called number of constituent quark ( ncq ) scaling  @xcite .",
    "the exact boundaries , where this picture is valid , if at all , is not exactly known .",

    "the measurements , though qualitatively similar to theoretical expectations at lower transverse momenta , are quite different from predictions at higher momenta .",

    "more discussion of the results obtained with many - particle cumulants can be found in  @xcite .",
    "charge dependent correlations , and in particular the charge dependent correlations relative to the different harmonics event planes are of great interest as those could reveal the phenomenon of the charge separation along the magnetic field , usually referred to as the chiral magnetic effect  @xcite . if observed it would manifest the local parity violation and directly demonstrate the important role of instantons and sphalerons , topologically nontrivial solutions of qcd .",
    "the alice collaboration recently measured 2-particle charge dependent correlations relative to the second order reaction plane .",
    "the results , see the @xmath13-average correlations in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hori1 ] , are qualitatively consistent with expectations from the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "these correlations are also found to be remarkably similar in strength to those measured at rhic .",
    "it is important to note that the observable used for this measurement is parity even and the results may contain ( or even be dominated by ) correlations not related to the parity violation .",
    "although at present neither event generator can explain these results , the blast wave model calculations including local charge conservation ( at freeze - out ) seem to be able to explain most of the charge dependent part of the measured correlations  @xcite . to investigate the effect of local charge conservation in more detail",
    ", the alice collaboration has measured several new correlations , some of which are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hori1 ] along with results of the recent blast wave model simulations  @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the model is very good , indicating that the local charge conservation likely plays an important role in forming such correlations .",
    "note however that the local charge conservation , at least as included in these blast wave simulations affects only opposite charge correlations and has to be combined with some additional mechanism in order to be consistent with data which exhibits very small opposite charge correlations with almost the entire charge dependent part coming from the same charge correlations .",
    "further insights in the nature of correlation can be obtained with differential studies , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hori2 ] .",
    "note a possible change in sign in differential correlations versus @xmath22 .",

    "the measurements at larger @xmath22 would be very desirable .",
    "more details on alice measurements of the charge dependent correlation can be found in  @xcite .     as a function of the two particle momentum difference , momentum sum , and pseudorapidity separation.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    another measurement that can clarify the origin of the charge dependent correlations and the role of the local charge conservation",
    "was suggested in  @xcite : the correlations measured with respect to the fourth harmonic even plane should not contain any contribution from the cme effect but it should include the effect of local charge conservation .",
    "the correlations due to the local charge conservation in this case are expected to be somewhat smaller in magnitude as the fourth harmonic flow is not that strong as the elliptic flow .",
    "the results of such measurements are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : jm ] with charge dependent part shown in the right panel .",
    "the correlations relative to the fourth harmonic event plane are very weak and suggestive of small contribution from local charge conservation but the detailed blast wave simulation has to be performed to draw more definite conclusion from this measurement .",
    "during the last few years our understanding of the importance of the initial geometry fluctuations and their role in forming odd harmonic anisotropic flow and all flow fluctuations has significantly improved .",
    "the results of measurements and simulations using monte carlo glauber model , suggest that flow fluctuations are very large .",
    "this can be used to select events with unusually large or small eccentricities , the technique called the event shape engineering  @xcite .",
    "this technique allows unprecedented studies , for example , of the system with very high density typical of very central collisions , and very large eccentricities as those in peripheral collisions .",
    "one should be careful performing the event shape analysis , not to be mistaken with events dominated by nonflow contribution .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite to use event selection ( using flow vector magnitude ) based on the information from one momentum window ( subevent ) and perform a physical analysis in a different momentum window ( subevent ) which is expected to have small correlations via nonflow to the first one .",
    "in alice we use an event selection based on the flow vector magnitude measured in one of the vzero detectors and perform the analysis using the tpc .",
    "those detectors are separated by about two units of pseudorapidity which greatly suppresses nonflow correlations between the two  @xcite .",
    "the results of this event shape engineering analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ese ] , where the left panel indicates the cuts used to select events with large and small flow ( eccentricity ) values .",
    "the right panel shows the results obtained with the corresponding event selection , in this case the ratio of elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum in events with large and small flow .",
    "approximately constant ratios indicate that the effect of flow fluctuations on particle production at different transverse momenta is very similar up to @xmath2410  gev/@xmath8 , which is in agreement with earlier conclusions made from comparison of the two- and four - particle cumulant measurements .",
    "more details on this measurement can be found in  @xcite ; for the study of @xmath13 spectra modification in events with large or small flow , see  @xcite .",
    "the alice collaboration has significantly extended its flow measurements toward higher transverse momentum and larger pseudorapidity coverage .",
    "it presented numerous results on anisotropic flow up to @xmath2420  gev/@xmath8   as well as average elliptic and triangular flow in the region @xmath25 . based on those measurements we find that the flow fluctuation effect is very similar at all pseudorapidities and up to transverse momenta of about 10  gev/@xmath8 .",
    "it was found that the difference between proton and pion elliptic flow extends to about the same transverse momentum , possibly indicating that this might be the region where jet physics starts to completely dominate all features of the particle production . the identified particle flow in the low transverse momentum range is well described by the hydrodynamical model ( including hadronic afterburner ) , while in the intermediate @xmath13 region",
    ", often associated with the quark coalescence picture , the ncq scaling holds at the 10 - 15% level .",
    "remarkable is the elliptic flow of @xmath15-meson which clearly follows the mass splitting in the low transverse momentum region and follows other meson flow at higher transverse momentum .",
    "the alice collaboration has presented a suit of charge dependent azimuthal correlations which might significantly clarify their nature , the role of the local charge conservation and possible contribution to these correlations from the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that a new promising technique , the event shape engineering , is fully capable of producing new and important results .",
