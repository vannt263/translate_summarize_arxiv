    "the problem in simulating spherical symmetry is topological : you can not build a perfect sphere from identical blocks .",
    "the absence of such a building block has enforced expensive simulations with complete spheres  though usually spherical simulations are simply avoided .",
    "overwhelming dilemmas like this are often considered so fundamental and frustrating that they restrain all attempts to seek for a practical solution .",
    "anyhow , avoiding spherical systems in our world is hard .",
    "spherical shells surround us in a variety of forms : in balloons , in cell membranes inside our bodies , in bubbles in the sea , or in earth s crust .",
    "the interaction of nanoparticles with cell membranes , for instance , is a topical question.@xcite since cell membranes curvature moduli _ determine _ the very forms of red blood cells , for example , one can see why simulations should incorporate curvature effects.@xcite another timely example is the foam of spherical bubbles in the sea , the bursting of which may play an important role on the so - called sea spray that produces spherical aerosols into the atmosphere.@xcite    although liquid membranes are more abundant in nature , also man - made solid membranes have spherical symmetries , at least locally .",
    "examples are fullerenes,@xcite nanoballoons,@xcite and especially graphene that contains intrinsic ripples even when suspended freely.@xcite curvature moduli of graphene are intimately related to these ripples , whether they are intrinsic or not,@xcite and in a broad sense to elastic behavior of all honeycomb carbon , among graphene nanoribbons,@xcite multilayer graphene,@xcite and carbon nanotubes.@xcite    conventionally spherical systems are treated in three ways .",
    "the first way is to simulate the system as a whole .",
    "needless to say , this is expensive and often impossible.@xcite the second way is , should the system have some well - defined point - group symmetries , to use those symmetries for reducing computational costs .",
    "most established codes have the ability to benefit from such symmetries ; this has long been a standard procedure with molecules and clusters.@xcite because the symmetry is exact , however , neither the curvature nor other geometrical parameters can be changed flexibly . the third way is to ignore curvature altogether and to use periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) to simulate an infinitely large , flat membrane .",
    "unfortunately , in nanoscience many systems fall between these two extremes : systems with huge number of particles , having no overall symmetry , but prominent curvature effects . at the moment a practical way to simulate such systems does not exist .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions have been adapted , however , also to symmetries beyond translation .",
    "the first ideas came along chiral carbon nanotubes,@xcite and those ideas have been used ever since ; for reviews look at refs .   and .",
    "an important extension to general symmetries with exact treatment was done in ref .  , which has enabled more flexibility.@xcite .",
    "later , ref .   introduced revised periodic boundary conditions ( rpbc ) , a simple formalism for general material distortions ;",
    "this is the approach we shall use here , and it s illustrating to review it briefly .    in rpbc ,",
    "the usual translation operations are replaced by general symmetry operations @xmath0 that , in a quantum - mechanical language , leave the electronic potential invariant , or @xmath1 the operation @xmath0 is a succession of an abelian group of operations @xmath2 , that is @xmath3 .",
    "then , by imposing periodicity ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 integer ) , one finds that the hamiltonian eigenstates @xmath6 at @xmath7 and at @xmath8 differ only by a phase factor , @xmath9 with inverse operation @xmath10 , band index @xmath11 , and the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath12 .",
    "eq.([eq : bloch ] ) infers the familiar result : a single simulation cell ",
    "whatever its shape  is enough to describe the extended system as a whole .",
    "revised pbc is hence similar to conventional pbc and differs only in the definitions of the symmetry operations .",
    "there are no other fundamental differences . as an illustrative example , the total energy with a classical pair potential is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the particle count and @xmath15 runs over operations where particle @xmath16 at @xmath17 still interacts with the periodic image of particle @xmath18 at @xmath19 .",
    "forces are the negative gradients of this expression , as usual .",
    "look at ref .   for details of rpbc and refs .   and for examples of usage",
    "in this paper we use the rpbc , reviewed above , in an approximate way to introduce a trick for modeling spherical membranes .",
    "adapting rpbc for spherical systems enables simulations with orders - of - magnitude reductions in computational costs .",
    "we shall apply the method to calculate graphene s mean and gaussian curvature moduli , but first we proceed to discuss symmetry operations and their character .",
    "and @xmath20 for spherical symmetry .",
    "@xmath21 is a rotation of angle @xmath22 around @xmath23-axis and @xmath20 is a rotation of angle @xmath24 around @xmath25-axis ; the angles @xmath26 are small .",
    "( in general , @xmath27 can also be non - orthogonal to @xmath28 and @xmath22 different from @xmath24.),width=207 ]    consider the square cone in fig .",
    "[ fig : operations ] , regard the grid as fixed in space , and concentrate on the shaded region .",
    "if we rotate all particles an angle @xmath22 around @xmath23-axis , or an angle @xmath24 around @xmath25-axis , the geometry within the shaded region will remain approximately intact .",
    "this means that rotations @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and operation @xmath33 as @xmath34-radian rotation around @xmath35 ) leave the electronic potential @xmath36 invariant near the shaded region : @xmath21 and @xmath20 are symmetry operations _ as far as the shaded region and its vicinity is concerned_. two rotations around different axes do not commute in general , but if the rotation angles @xmath26 are small @xmath37 , rotations do commute to linear order in @xmath26 s , @xmath38=\\mathcal{o}(\\delta \\theta_i^2)$ ] .",
    "hence also the combined operation @xmath39 is an approximate symmetry operation , provided that @xmath40 are small enough .",
    "eq.([eq : rotation - operation ] ) is basically all we need to fully employ the rpbc of ref .  ; we are , in principle , ready to go and to simulate any spherical membrane .",
    "in practice , however , the approximate character of @xmath0 raises questions that deserve some elaboration .",
    "first , as already mentioned , the formalism assumes periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath41 ) which may seem questionable .",
    "here we remind that similar pbcs are used also in regular bulk , with all three dimensions periodic in an intertwined fashion .",
    "( in two dimensions pbc represents topologically a toroid . )",
    "the bottom line is that periodicity is not a physical reality but a mere mathematical trick that works , and enables the application of revised bloch s theorem in the first place.@xcite the integers @xmath5 are connected rather to @xmath12-point sampling than to physical reality .",
    "second , revised pbc does not need the `` unit cell '' concept .",
    "however , we shall call the square cone in fig .",
    "[ fig : operations ] , extending from the origin to infinity and enclosing the shaded region , a unit or simulation cell because the concept is familiar and convenient in discussion .",
    "otherwise , the mere expression for @xmath0 in eq.([eq : rotation - operation ] ) is enough to determine everything in the simulation .",
    "third , the claim is not to simulate a complete sphere , but rather to _ view the curvature as a local property_. the particles in the simulation cell see the closest environment curved  and only this is important .",
    "the simulation cell is the only cell we model , and distances and angles measured only from the simulation cell are meaningful .",
    "for example , the vicinity of particle at @xmath7 in fig.[fig : operations ] exhibits curvature in bond angles and distances if one looks at particle s own periodic images at @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "symmetry operations @xmath0 that have @xmath40 large enough to rotate large angles ( @xmath44 ) should be excluded because the non - commutativity of @xmath45 s would otherwise become significant .",
    "fourth , the radius or curvature @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : operations ] is not a parameter in the simulation ; radially particles can migrate wherever interactions drive them .",
    "the spherical form is only forced by the choice of symmetry operations and the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath24 , and since the symmetry is discrete , the system needs to be neither continuously nor smoothly spherical .",
    "fifth , a natural limitation is to have enough empty space near the origin to avoid too close encounters between the particles.@xcite membrane can be thick .",
    "the validity of the method depends on the system and its interactions . as a principal rule ,",
    "the radius of curvature @xmath46 should be much larger than the interaction ranges between the particles .",
    "if ranges are larger than the system size , especially if those interactions control morphology , one does better to model the complete system .",
    "the coulomb interactions can play a role locally , within small length scales ( size of the unit cell at most ) , but the long - ranged coulomb interaction requires special care , perhaps some refinements ( the unit cell better be neutral).@xcite quantitative error due to the non - commutativity of @xmath45 s can be estimated by first using the right - hand side of eq.([eq : rotation - operation ] ) as @xmath0 , and then using the left - hand side of eq.([eq : rotation - operation ] ) as @xmath0 ( changing the ordering of @xmath47 ) , and comparing the resulting energies .    because liquid lacks long - range order , the method suits particularly well for liquid membranes , such as lipid bilayers .",
    "their energetics can be described by the helfrich hamiltonian that gives membrane s elastic energy per unit area as  @xcite @xmath48 \\right)^2 + \\overline{\\kappa } \\frac{1}{r_1 r_2}. \\label{eq : helfrich}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 is the mean curvature modulus ( do nt confuse with a @xmath12-point ) , @xmath50 is the gaussian curvature modulus , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the principal radii of curvature . the liquid membrane does nt need to be free - standing , however , because also solid support can be incorporated , either by external force fields or by fixed atoms .",
    "external radial forces can be also used for pressurization , mimicking the embedding of membrane in gaseous or liquid environments .    for solid membranes",
    "the situation is more complicated , because energy will come also from the internal strain @xmath53 .",
    "if a flat , round sheet of radius @xmath54 is wrapped into a spherical segment , the energy will be @xmath55,@xcite where @xmath56 is the young s modulus of the material , @xmath57 is the membrane thickness , and @xmath46 is the radius of curvature ; meanwhile the curvature - related energy is @xmath58 .",
    "hence , for a reasonable modeling of solid membranes using eq.([eq : helfrich ] ) , we need to have @xmath59 , or @xmath60 which suggests a minimum radius of curvature @xmath61 for a given unit cell area . if this geometrical and material - dependent criterion should be violated , the simulation would be dominated by non - local stress fields .",
    "since the method does not properly describe these fields , the treatment would become ill - defined .",
    "the above problem is present when sphericity is forced on originally flat sheet .",
    "but defects , for example , can induce spontaneous curvature in solid membranes in which case @xmath61 can be smaller .",
    "the method provides a new tool to investigate phenomena such as rippling due to adsorption - induced pinching of the membrane.@xcite this method does not directly compete with any existing method , but instead it provides possibilities to do something new .",
    "the spherical symmetry was implemented in the density - functional tight - binding code ` hotbit`.@xcite the rpbc implementation has a negligible computational overhead as compared to translational symmetry,@xcite and can be implemented just by a few lines of new code in any existing rpbc implementation .",
    "the code source is open and stands for inspection .    in this section",
    "we use the ` hotbit ` implementation to present one practical example .",
    "we calculate the curvature moduli of graphene , motivated by their relevance to present - day engineering with carbon nanostructures . for a sphere",
    "the radii of curvature are @xmath62 , and eq.([eq : helfrich ] ) gives @xmath63 ; for a cylinder @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "hence , by calculating the elastic energies for a cylinder and a sphere and varying @xmath26 s ( hence varying @xmath46 ) we obtain both @xmath49 and @xmath50 directly .",
    "is a rotation of angle @xmath22 around @xmath27 and @xmath67 is a rotation of angle @xmath24 around @xmath28 .",
    "( b ) few periodic images of atoms @xmath11 and @xmath68 , shown for visualization purposes only .",
    "( c ) elastic energy per atom as a function of radius of curvature .",
    "inset : fit to @xmath69 behavior ; the thin shaded fan is the error estimate due to approximations involved.,width=283 ]    prior to simulating spherical graphene , we first calculated the mean curvature modulus of graphene , also applying revised pbc . only now the symmetry operations , in a cylinder - like setup , were a rotation around @xmath70-axis ( @xmath71 ) and translation in @xmath70-direction ( @xmath67 ) with a @xmath72-atom unit cell ( like a nanotube with enormous diameter ) ; we wo nt discuss the cylinder setup further here.@xcite the resulting cohesive energy depends on @xmath46 quantitatively like @xmath69 , as eq.([eq : helfrich ] ) suggests , and the fitted value for @xmath73  ev ( @xmath74  ev@xmath75/atom ) agrees with a density - functional reference value ( @xmath76  ev)@xcite albeit is larger than an experimental reference value ( @xmath77  ev).@xcite    returning to spherical graphene , figs .  [ fig : graphene]a and [ fig : graphene]b show the two - atom unit cell of graphene .",
    "unlike in fig.[fig : operations ] , the unit cell is skewed with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the geometry was optimized with given @xmath26 s , which were taken as @xmath80  @xmath81 when we wanted to investigate a radius of curvature that roughly equals @xmath82.@xcite all the radii of curvature we report , anyhow , are the optimized @xmath46 ( @xmath83 because curvature changes bond distances only slightly ) . in practice",
    "we found that structure optimizations require convergence criteria tighter than with translational cells , due to geometrical effects from small @xmath26.@xcite in quantum simulations @xmath12-points can be freely sampled ( @xmath84 $ ] ) because pbc is an approximation , just as with conventional bloch s theorem ; we used a @xmath85 @xmath12-point mesh .",
    "fig.[fig : graphene]c shows our main result , graphene s cohesive energy as a function curvature  and represents the showcase of the new physics this method can unearth .",
    "energy behaves clearly like @xmath69 , as suggested by eq.([eq : helfrich ] ) .",
    "the energy penalty @xmath86  ev@xmath87/atom , combined with previously calculated @xmath49 , yields @xmath88  ev ; we could not find this number in the literature .",
    "this result confirms graphene s beautiful elastic behavior up to high curvature  also for spherical distortion.@xcite    we did consistency checks for the graphene sphere calculations , three listed next . as a first check ,",
    "when we investigate eq.([eq : criterion ] ) with graphene parameters , we get @xmath89 . for a graphene unit cell @xmath90    ( lattice constant",
    "@xmath91   ) , and the consequent criterion @xmath92    is easily fulfilled .",
    "we obtained the same @xmath50 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 atom unit cells , even though larger @xmath14 increases @xmath61 ( eq.([eq : criterion ] ) and @xmath95 infer @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus , the area is small enough to be stress - free , and the simulation is indeed dominated by curvature energy alone .",
    "we were able to perform controlled calculations down to radii @xmath97   or @xmath98 .",
    "as a second check , we estimated quantitative error in energy due to the non - commutativity of the two rotations ( inset in fig.[fig : graphene]c ) , as suggested above , but found the error fairly small .",
    "as a third check , we implemented symmetry also with a negative gaussian curvature @xmath99 , for which @xmath100 directly , and got an independent confirmation for @xmath50 ; we wo nt attempt to describe structures with negative gaussian curvature here . finally , since there is no charge transfer , the long - range coulomb interactions are no issue .",
    "closer inspection of geometry revealed that curvature increased bond distances as @xmath101  @xmath102  @xmath103 , due to the weakening of in - plane @xmath104-bonds , and hereby decreasing the effective nearest - neighbor tight - binding hopping parameter as @xmath105  ev@xmath106 ( @xmath107  ev ) . for a detailed discussion of curvature - induced effects on graphene , we recommend refs .  , and .",
