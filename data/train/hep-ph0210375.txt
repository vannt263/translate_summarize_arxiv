    "the cdf experiment has recently discovered an anomaly in the production rate of lepton - photon-@xmath0 in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 , using 86.34 pb@xmath6 of tevatron 1994 - 95 data @xcite . while the number of events expected from the standard model ( sm ) were @xmath7 , the experimentally measured number corresponded to 16 .",
    "moreover , 11 of these events involved muons ( with 4.2 @xmath8 0.5 expected ) and 5 electrons ( with 3.4 @xmath8 0.3 expected ) .    in earlier papers",
    "@xcite we suggested that the excess can be simply understood in terms of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) which has the following ingredients : ( 1 ) the model is @xmath9-parity violating with an @xmath10-violating @xmath11 coupling , and ( 2 ) the supersymmetric spectrum includes an ultra - light gravitino of mass @xmath12 ev .",
    "we have demonstrated in our earlier papers @xcite that such a model provides a natural explanation of the cdf anomaly and explains not only the excess in the number of @xmath13 events but also explains the main features of the kinematic distributions of the excess events .",
    "the excess can be explained using a small value of the @xmath10-violating coupling @xmath14 because of the resonant production of smuons in the annihilation of an initial - state @xmath15 pair .",
    "the smuon thus produced decays predominantly into a bino - dominated neutralino and a muon , with the neutralino further decaying into a photon and a gravitino .",
    "the production and decay has been shown in the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "the fact that the excess is seen in final states involving photons emerges very neatly in our model because the decay @xmath16 dominates overwhelmingly over other decay modes .",

    "we include the d0 run i measurement  @xcite of the @xmath24 missing @xmath25 process , as well as @xmath23 missing @xmath25 data coming from cdf in run i  @xcite .",
    "the empirical background event - rate in the @xmath26 channel is quite different in the cdf and d0 cases due to the different cuts employed .",
    "our scenario predicts excesses in each of these channels , and we determine to what extent it is in accord with their measured rates . by performing a combined fit to all three event rates ,",
    "we constrain the masses of the relevant sparticles in the event , as well as @xmath11 .",
    "in order that the cross - section for the production of the smuon resonance is substantial enough to account for the anomalous events , we need the left - handed smuon to be light i.e. @xmath27 gev .",
    "further , one needs to couple the smuon to valence quarks in the initial state implying that the @xmath10-violating operator that we need is @xmath28 corresponding to the coupling @xmath11 , which generates the interactions @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( and charge conjugates ) , along with other supersymmetrised copies involving squarks .",
    "therefore , the operator we invoke in our model predicts supersymmetric signals in other channels which manifest themselves through the production of either sneutrinos or squarks . in our model , we take the squarks to be heavy and so their effects on experimental observables will be negligible .",
    "on the other hand , the spontaneously broken su(2)@xmath31 symmetry in the mssm implies that muon sneutrinos have a tree - level mass squared  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass of the muon , @xmath34 the weinberg angle , and @xmath35 the ratio of the mssm higgs vacuum expectation values ( @xmath36 ) . since @xmath37",
    "if we assumed that smuons were produced at the tevatron run i energy , we should expect that muon sneutrinos could also be produced .",

    "we enforce degeneracy between the first two generations in order to avoid flavour changing neutral currents .",
    "other sparticles do not play a role in this analysis , and are set to be arbitrarily heavy .",
    "such a light gravitino materialises naturally in models of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb)@xcite . however , in the minimal version of gmsb models the chargino and the second - lightest neutralino are not much heavier than the neutralino and this feature of the minimal model is certainly not desirable for our considerations because it leads to large jets@xmath42 rates which are not seen by experiments cdf event  @xcite . ] .",
    "if the minimal versions of gmsb models do not yield the pattern of super - particle masses that we need , then the obvious question to ask is what is the high - energy model that yields this mass spectrum at low energies .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a mass spectrum can arise in an alternate model of gmsb which is obtained from compactifying 11-dimensional m - theory on a 7-manifold of g2 holonomy  @xcite . for the purposes of this paper , however ,",
    "we simply work with the low - energy model with the mass spectrum described above and do not worry about the high energy completion of this model .",

    "however , instead of simultaneously fitting the four parameters using the experimental data , we choose to work with fixed values of two of these parameters close to their best - fit values while performing fits in the two other parameters . for our analysis",

    "the coupling , @xmath11 , is constrained from @xmath47 @xcite to be @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "but since the constraint involves a squark mass which is large in our model , it is not very relevant .",
    "while the production of the smuon resonance is through the @xmath9-violating mode , to produce the @xmath49 excess we require that its decay goes through the @xmath9-conserving channel to a neutralino and muon final state .",
    "the @xmath9-violating decay of the slepton is possible but constrained , in principle , by the tevatron di - jet data @xcite which exclude a @xmath50 pb at 95%  c.l . for a resonance mass of 200 gev .",
    "however , in practice this does not provide a restrictive bound upon our scenario as long as the @xmath9-violating coupling is sufficiently small , @xmath51 .",
    "we also add that the di - jet bound is not restrictive because it suffers from a huge qcd background . by restricting @xmath11 to be small",
    ", we also avoid significant rates for the possible @xmath9-violating decays of @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
