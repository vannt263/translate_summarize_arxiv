    "non equilibrium work fluctuations and equilibrium free energy differences are related to each other through a remarkable identity proposed and proved by jarzynski @xcite . ever since several studies have been carried out to establish the validity and utility of the identity for various non - equilibrium evolutions - stochastic , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite as well as deterministic , see _",
    "@xcite    we show in this paper that jarzynski identity can be viewed as a cumulant expansion .",
    "when we retain only the first cumulant in the expansion , we get the well known thermodynamic identity equating the work done on the system to free energy change in a quasistatic reversible process . with only the first two cumulants in the expansion , we get callen - welton theorem @xcite . when we include the third and higher order cumulants we get jarzynski identity .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for probability of violation of the second law , under gaussian approximation to work fluctuations .",
    "we then carry out monte carlo simulation of a liquid crystal system in the presence of a varying electric field and report numerical results on free energy changes , dissipation , probability of violation of the second law and distribution of work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a brief introduction to a few relevant basic issues of heat and work in a quasistatic reversible process .",
    "then we consider heat and work in the context of irreversible processes .",
    "this is followed by a discussion on the relation between non - equilibrium work fluctuations and equilibrium free energy differences .",
    "we show analytically that the probability of violation of the second law increases with increase of time duration of the switching experiment and in the asymptotic limit of a quasistatic process it goes to one - half .",
    "however dissipation defined as average work minus reversible work becomes smaller when the duration of time of the switching process increases and in the quasistatic limit it goes to zero .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of jarzynski identity @xcite on a system of liquid crystals in the presence of external electric field .",
    "we consider a lattice model with each lattice site holding a headless spin .",
    "we calculate the work done when the external electric field is switched from an initial value to a final value following a well specified experimental protocol .",
    "we carry monte carlo simulation of the non - equilibrium switching process and collect an ensemble of work values . from this ensemble",
    "we extract equilibrium properties of the liquid crystalline system employing both jarzynski identity and callen - welton theorem @xcite .",
    "principal conclusions of the study are brought out briefly in the concluding section .",
    "consider a closed system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it draws a small quantity @xmath5 of heat by a quasistatic reversible process at constant temperature .",
    "@xmath5 is not a perfect differential .",
    "however , @xmath6 is a perfect differential where @xmath7 is entropy .",
    "thus , during a quasistatic reversible process , entropy of the system increases by @xmath8 .    to calculate the work done on the system , we start with the first law of thermodynamics , stated as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the work done on the system and @xmath11 , the internal energy .",
    "@xmath10 is not a perfect differential .",
    "the first law is about conservation of energy and is valid for all processes , quasistatic , non - quasistatic , reversible , irreversible or otherwise .",
    "however , if the process is quasistatic and reversible , then we can replace @xmath5 by @xmath12 , see eq .",
    "( [ clausius_entropy ] ) , and write ,",
    "@xmath13 if the process is also isothermal , we have @xmath14 we identify the term @xmath15 as legendre transform of the fundamental equation @xmath16 where we transform the variable @xmath7 in favor of the slope@xmath17 and the variable @xmath11 in favor of the intercept@xmath18 @xmath19 is called helmholtz free energy or simply free energy .",
    "thus the work done equals free energy change : @xmath20 for purpose of distinguishing process variables ( heat and work ) from state variables ( energy @xmath11 , entropy @xmath7 and free energy @xmath21 ) we have considered in the above an infinitesimal process . @xmath5 and @xmath10 are not perfect differentials ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are perfect differentials .",
    "however the relation between free energy and work , see eq .",
    "( [ w_df ] ) , holds good for a quasistatic reversible process that takes the system from one equilibrium state , say @xmath25 to another equilibrium state , say @xmath26 .",
    "we have @xmath27 we call the above as reversible work and denote it by @xmath0",
    "to obtain a relation between change in free energy and work done when the process is not reversible , we start with the second law inequality , see @xcite for an elegant proof , given by @xmath28 the above implies @xmath29 for an irreversible process .",
    "substitute this in eq .",
    "( [ first_law ] ) and get , @xmath30 which for an isothermal irreversible process reduces to @xmath31 consider a process that takes the system irreversibly from an equilibrium state @xmath25 to another equilibrium state @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the work done during the process and @xmath33 .",
    "we have @xmath34 the work done exceeds free energy change , if the process is not reversible .",
    "this is the best conclusion we can draw from purely thermodynamics considerations .",
    "a natural question that arises in this context is about the meaning of the statement @xmath35 .",
    "a given process can be realized either in an experiment or in a computer simulation .",
    "we recognize that work done , in general , would differ from one experiment or computer realization of the process to another .",
    "let us consider a process in which a parameter of the thermodynamics system is switched from one value to another , as per a well defined experimental protocol .",
    "for example , we can change the volume of a system from one value to another uniformly over a fixed duration of time @xmath36 .",
    "we call this a switching process",
    ". in general , different switching experiments , all carried out with the same protocol , will give rise to different values of @xmath32 .",
    "only when the switching is done quasistatically and reversibly does one get the same value of @xmath32 in all experiments .",
    "hence , in general , we have to deal with an ensemble of values of @xmath32 and not just a single value .",
    "let us denote this ensemble by @xmath37 .",
    "it is then quite possible that there can exist realizations for which @xmath32 is less than @xmath24 , thereby _ violating _ the second law .",
    "this should not surprise us since even in the early days of statistical mechanics , maxwell @xcite correctly recognized that the second law is of statistical origin and hence there is a non - zero probability of it being contravened .",
    "the demon he created to drive home this point , haunts us even today , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "let the ensemble @xmath38 of work values be formally described by the distribution @xmath39 where @xmath36 denotes the duration of time over which the process takes place ; @xmath36 is the switching time .",
    "typically we switch a macroscopic parameter , denoted by the symbol @xmath40 from an initial value say @xmath41 to a final value say @xmath42 .",
    "this switching can be carried out in any way . the discussions below and the jarzynski identity described in the next section hold good for any protocol of switching .",
    "however we consider the switching to take place at constant rate , over a pre specified duration of time , @xmath36 .",
    "then by considering different values of @xmath43 we can describe different switching scenarios : if @xmath36 is small , we have fast switching ; if @xmath36 is large we have slow switching ; in the limit of @xmath36 @xmath44 @xmath45 , we have a quasistatic reversible switching .",
    "thus @xmath46 the probability of violation of the second law , denoted by the symbol @xmath47 is formally given by the following integral .",
    "@xmath48    we note that for every thermodynamic variable there corresponds a random variable in statistical mechanics .",
    "the average of the random variable over a suitable ensemble gives the value of the thermodynamic variable .",
    "for example @xmath49 equals the thermodynamic energy @xmath11 , where the angular brackets denote average over a canonical ensemble .",
    "hence , strictly we should state the second law as @xmath50 in the above , the angular brackets denote an average over an ensemble of switching experiments , all carried out with the same protocol . in other words",
    "it is given by @xmath51 stated thus , the second law can never be violated .",
    "we define @xmath52 as dissipation and state the second law as described in the next section @xmath53 for all processes . in the above",
    ", equality obtains when the process is quasistatic and reversible .",
    "if @xmath36 is very large but not infinity , @xmath39 would be sharply peaked and gaussian . consider a process that takes a system from an equilibrium state @xmath25 to another equilibrium state @xmath26 .",
    "let the process be nearly quasistatic .",
    "we have @xmath54 . the time taken for the process , @xmath36 , is large .",
    "for such a process , dissipation is proportional to fluctuations , and from callen - welton theorem @xcite we get , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the first cumulant and @xmath57 is the second cumulant ( or variance ) of @xmath32 .",
    "thus we have @xmath58 from eq .",
    "( [ w_r_fdt ] ) : dissipation ( @xmath59 ) is proportional to fluctuation ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) .    measuring energy in units of @xmath62 , we get , from eq .",
    "( [ w_r_fdt ] ) , @xmath63 the above relation is for a process which is nearly quasistatic .",
    "the distribution of work for such a switching protocol is gaussian . for a gaussian ,",
    "the third and higher order cumulants are all identically zero .",
    "we contend that in a general process , which is not necessarily quasistatic or near quasistatic , there should be additional terms in the right hand side ( rhs ) of the above equation involving third and higher cumulants .",
    "once we include these higher cumulants we get jarzynski identity , as shown in the next section .",
    "including the terms involving the third and higher order cumulants in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ two_cumulants ] ) , we get , @xmath64 we recognize immediately the right hand side ( rhs ) of the above equation as the cumulant expansion of @xmath32 .",

    "thus we have , @xmath66 or equivalently @xmath67 the moment generating function of @xmath32 is defined as @xmath68 the moment and cumulant generating functions are related to each other .",

    "this result can be understood as follows@xcite . in the quasistatic limit of @xmath80",
    ", @xmath81 becomes more and more sharply peaked such that @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
