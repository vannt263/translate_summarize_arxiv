    "the most straightforward incarnation of this inflationary scenario predicts that the fluctuations are adiabatic , gaussian , harrison - zeldovich ( @xmath12 ) and that the universe is spatially flat ( kolb & turner 1990 ) . to avoid violating primordial nucleosynthesis constraints ,",
    "the universe should be dominated by non - baryonic matter .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has been the preferred model in the inflationary scenario ( peebles 1982 , liddle and lyth , 1993 ) .",
    "the statistical properties of cmb fluctuations provide an ideal tool for testing cdm models .",
    "cmb data offer valuable information not only on the scenario of the origin of cosmic structures , but also on the early physics of the universe and the cosmological parameters that characterize the universe . using the cmb to determine these parameters",
    "is the beginning of a new era in cosmology .",
    "this truly cosmological method probes scales much larger and epochs much earlier ( @xmath13 ) than more traditional techniques which rely on supernovae , galaxies , galaxy clusters and other low - redshift objects .",
    "the cmb probes the entire observable universe .",
    "acoustic oscillations of the baryon  photon fluid at recombination produce peaks and valleys in the cmb power spectrum at sub - degree angular scales .",
    "measurements of these model - dependent peaks and valleys have the potential to determine many important cosmological parameters to the few percent level ( jungman 1996 , zaldarriaga 1997 ) . within the next decade , increasingly accurate sub - degree scale cmb observations from the ground , from balloons and particularly from two new satellites ( map : wright 1996 , planck surveyor : bersanelli 1996 ) will tell us the ultimate fate of the universe ( @xmath14 ) , what the universe is made of ( @xmath1 , @xmath15 ) and the age and size of the universe ( @xmath16 ) with unprecedented precision .    in preparation for the increasingly fruitful harvests of data , it is important to determine what the combined cmb data can _ already _ tell us about the cosmological parameters . in lineweaver ( 1997 ) , ( henceforth `` paper i '' ) , we compared the most recent cmb data to predictions of cobe normalized flat universes with harrison - zeldovich ( @xmath10 ) power spectra .",
    "we used predominantly goodness - of - fit statistics to locate the regions of parameter space preferred by the cmb data .",
    "we explored the @xmath17 plane and the @xmath18 plane .    in the present paper we focus on the range for @xmath19 favored by the cmb in the context of cdm critical density universes and we broaden the scope of our exploration to the 4-dimensional parameter space : @xmath19 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our motivation for choosing this 4-d subspace of the higher dimensional parameter space is that ( i ) it is the largest dimensional subspace that we can explore at a reasonable resolution with the means available and ( ii ) it is centered on the simplest cdm model : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath10 .",
    "this model is arguably the simplest scenario for the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "one of our goals is to see what is required of such a model if it is to explain the current set of large - scale structure data , and what could eventually force us to accept the fine - tuning demanded by the inclusion of another cosmological parameter , such as the cosmological constant .",
    "hubble s constant @xmath0 is possibly the most important parameter in cosmology , giving the expansion rate , age and size of the universe .",
    "recent , direct , low - redshift measurements fall in the range [ 45 - 90 ] but may be subject to unidentified systematic errors . thus it is important to have different methods which may not be subject to the same systematics . for example , cmb determinations of @xmath19 are distance - ladder - independent .",
    "current cmb data are not of high enough quality to draw definitive model - independent conclusions , however in the restricted class of models considered here , the cmb data are already able to provide interesting constraints .",

    "the combination @xmath22 is relatively well - constrained by the observations and theory of primordial nucleosynthesis , but the uncertainty on the hubble constant means that the value of @xmath1 is rather poorly constrained .",
    "the question of just how many baryons there are in the universe has received close attention recently due to estimates of the baryon fraction in galaxy clusters and attempts to constrain @xmath1 by measuring the deuterium in high - redshift quasar absorption systems .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is the primordial power spectrum slope that remains equal to its primordial value at the largest scales ( low @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is important because it s measurement is a glimpse at the primordial universe .",
    "although generic inflation predicts @xmath25 , a larger set of plausible inflationary models is consistent with @xmath26 .",
    "model power spectra and particularly the amplitude of the first peak depend strongly on @xmath2 .",
    "thus , an important limitation of paper i was the restriction to @xmath25 . by adding @xmath2 as a free parameter we obtain observational limits on @xmath2 and quantify the reduced constraining ability of the cmb observations when @xmath2 is marginalized .",
    "the power spectrum quadrupole normalization @xmath3 is important because it normalizes all models .",
    "here we treat @xmath3 as a free parameter .",

    "adams ( 1996 ) come to similar conclusions .",
    "bartlett ( 1995 ) listed the advantages of a low @xmath19 in critical density universes , the main point being that there exists a region of parameter space in which this simplest of models remains consistent with observations of the large - scale structure of the universe .",

    "@xmath124 yields an age for the universe of 21.7 gyr comfortably in accord with globular cluster ages .    what is perhaps surprising is the fact that the cmb data do not rule out such a such a low value of @xmath0 but seem to favor it within the context of this type of scenario",
    "of course , these low @xmath0 values are in disagreement with current measurements of the hubble constant .      figures [ fig : hn3 ] through [ fig : nq3 ] show our 4-d @xmath4 ellipsoid projected on to 2-d planes orthogonal to the @xmath125 plane .",
    "the limits obtained on @xmath19 from figure [ fig : hn3 ] are the same as we obtained from figure [ fig : hob3 ] since we are projecting the same 4-d @xmath4 surface . @xmath19 and @xmath23 are positively correlated for @xmath126 and possibly negatively correlated for @xmath127 . in figure",

    "any increase of the slope lowers the y - intercept ( at @xmath130 ) and any decrease of the slope raises the y - intercept .",
    "the anti - correlation is thus inherent with the use of the amplitude at @xmath130 as the normalization .",
    "the increase of the size of the error bars on @xmath23 and @xmath3 as @xmath19 and @xmath1 are conditioned on and then marginalized can be seen by comparing figures [ fig : nq1 ] and [ fig : nq3 ] .",

    "debernardis ( 1996 ) found that current cmb anisotrophy measurements can not distinguish between cdm and mdm models .",
    "we agree with this assessment and add that hdm and cdm models also can not usefully be distinguished with current cmb data .",
    "in addition to the @xmath19 , @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 considered here , regions of a larger dimensional parameter space deserve further investigation including @xmath14 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , early reionization parameters such as @xmath158 , tensor mode parameters @xmath159 and @xmath160 , iso - curvature or adiabatic initial conditions and topological defect models with their additional parameters such as the coherence length . the fact that we obtain acceptable @xmath4 values in our small 4-d parameter space lends some support to the idea that we may be close to the right model . however establishing error bars on broad - band power estimates",
    "is a relatively new science .",
    "if the universe is not well - described by these models then as the data improve , work like this will show poor @xmath100 fits and other regions of parameter space may be preferred .",
    "cmb measurements have become sensitive enough to constrain cosmological parameters in a restricted class of models .",
    "the results we have presented here are valid under the assumption of gaussian adiabatic initial conditions in a critical density ( @xmath27 ) universe with no cosmological constant .",
    "we have explored the 4-dimensional parameter space of @xmath19 , @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 .",
    "our cmb - derived constraints on @xmath19 , @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 exclude large regions of parameter space .",
    "we obtain a low value for hubble s constant : @xmath161 .",
    "the cmb data constrain @xmath1 only weakly : @xmath6 . for the slope and normalization of the power spectrum",
    "we obtain @xmath7 and @xmath8k .",
    "the error bars on each parameter are for the case where the other 3 parameters have been marginalized .",
    "when we condition on @xmath10 we obtain the normalization @xmath11k .",
    "cmb constraints are independent of other cosmological tests of these parameters and are thus particularly important .",
    "the fact that reasonable @xmath100 values are obtained means that the current cmb data are consistent with inflationary - based cdm models with a low hubble constant . in the context of the models considered , the cmb results are consistent with four other independent cosmological measurements but are in disagreement with more direct measurements of @xmath19",
