    "the morphology of superconducting vortex lattices ( vl ) attracts great interest as a source of microscopic information of the nature of the superconductivity and as model systems of condensed matter .",
    "the elastic matrix @xmath1 of a vl thereby describes the energy associated with a distortion of the vl due to thermal fluctuations , gradients of magnetic field or temperature , pinning and the presence of transport currents .",
    "analogous to crystal lattices the elastic matrix @xmath1 of a vl determines the thermal stability and the state of aggregation of superconducting vortex matter : besides the regular abrikosov vl , vl bragg glasses , liquids and ices have been identified @xcite .    at vl melting transitions the shear modulus discontinuously jumps to @xmath2 , where the long range order vanishes .",
    "vl melting was observed for various superconducting systems , mostly for high-@xmath3 compounds due to their high transition temperature @xcite , but also in compounds characterized by disorder as nbse@xmath4 and mgb@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , a melting transition was recently reported also for the heavy fermion compound uru@xmath4si@xmath4 @xcite in the clean limit .",
    "melting transitions show up as characteristic dips of the differential resistivity and can also lead to tiny jumps of the local magnetization of the order of few tenths of a gauss , detectable with sensitive hall probes @xcite .",
    "measurements to detect melting transitions are intricate , as effects induced by depinning can yield similar results",
    ". however , the presence of pinning is required in general , as a perfect , pinning free vl shows no signature in the resistivity at the melting transition @xcite .",
    "moreover the elastic matrix @xmath1 of vls is intimately related to the pinning and depinning properties of superconducting vortices .",
    "this is especially important for technical applications : if transport currents are applied to superconducting materials , the lorentz force acting on the vortices leads  with increasing current  to dissipative processes such as vortex creep @xcite , thermally assisted flux - flow ( taff ) @xcite and flux - flow ( ff ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ability of superconducting materials to carry large transport currents for technical applications is closely connected to the pinning properties of superconductors and the elasticity of the vl .",
    "the elastic constants of the vl @xmath5 for compression , @xmath0 for tilt and @xmath6 for shear hence reflect the microscopic nature of the superconductivity as well as impurity or surface properties of the superconducting sample due to pinning @xcite .    the experimental access to the elastic matrix @xmath1 of vls  in particular for non - equilibrium states  by macroscopic bulk techniques such as the transport properties @xcite , the magnetization @xcite or measurements using vibrating reeds @xcite is strongly influenced by parasitic pinning effects as well as geometric effects .",
    "moreover , the momentum - dependence of the elasticity of vls can not be determined unambiguously by macroscopic measurements .",
    "due to the use of thin film samples , microscopic surface sensitive techniques such like decoration or magneto - optical methods suffer from similar or even stronger pinning and geometry induced effects .",
    "in contrast , local probes such as muon spin relaxation ( @xmath7sr ) and scattering techniques such as neutron scattering yield microscopic information on bulk vls . however , as the accessible timescale of inelastic neutron scattering techniques is still too short for vl dynamical properties , neutron scattering was up to now limited to characterize the static properties of vls with only a few exceptions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report direct microscopic measurements of the vl tilt modulus @xmath0 with drastically reduced limitations due to surface pinning in ultra - pure bulk niobium ( nb ) using a time - resolved neutron scattering technique as combined with a tailored magnetic field setup . with its low ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath8 ,",
    "situated close to the border of type - i and type - ii behaviour , the superconductivity in nb is ideally suited as model system for systematic studies of vortex matter @xcite . by imposing a periodic tilting of the magnetic field ,",
    "we induce a relaxation process of the vl which can be described by a diffusion process in the limit of uniform tilt .",
    "the diffusion constant of this diffusion process is given by the tilt modulus @xmath0 of the vl and the flux flow resistivity @xmath9 .",
    "the characteristic properties of the diffusion process are observed by means of time resolved stroboscopic small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) @xcite .",
    "the relaxation processes observed show increasing vl stiffness with increasing magnetic field @xmath10 and reduced damping with increasing temperature @xmath11 .",
    "this behaviour agrees well with calculations performed within a vl diffusion model @xcite .",
    "besides these general trends , we observe a dramatic change of the relaxation processes associated with the non - trivial vl morphology in the intermediate mixed state ( ims ) .",
    "our study represents a showcase for how to access directly vl melting , the formation of vortex glass states and slow vortex dynamics also in unconventional superconductors , notably the cuprates , heavy - fermion systems , borocarbide or ironarsenide systems .",
