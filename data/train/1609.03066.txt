    "sis@xmath0 is a member of an important family of group iv - vi ab@xmath0 compounds made of light elements including well - known materials such as co@xmath0 @xcite , sio@xmath0 @xcite , geo@xmath0 @xcite and cs@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "limited to relatively low pressures , the structural evolution of sis@xmath0 has also been accurately described .",
    "@xcite the ambient - pressure stable phase known as np - sis@xmath0 has orthorhombic @xmath5 structure and consists of distorted edge - sharing tetrahedra forming 1d chains which interact via weak van der waals forces @xcite . at 2.8 gpa , a first high - pressure phase hp1-sis@xmath0 @xcite appears , with monoclinic space group @xmath6 , by interconnection of the np - sis@xmath0 chains to form 2d layers @xcite .",
    "the connectivity pattern changes from each tetrahedron sharing two edges in the np phase to sharing one edge and two corners in hp1 @xcite .",
    "the very same structure was recently predicted to be stable at pressures beyond 30 gpa in cs@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "further increase of pressure leads to the hp2-sis@xmath0 phase at 3.5 gpa @xcite , again with @xmath6 space group , and again with edge- and corner - sharing tetrahedra , in this case , however , with a 3d connectivity network with large cavities @xcite .",
    "finally , at 4 gpa , a tetragonal @xmath7 structure denoted as hp3-sis@xmath0 takes over , a phase formed by strictly corner - sharing tetrahedra that are slightly distorted and span the whole three - dimensional space @xcite . the same structure as hp3-sis@xmath0 is adopted by co@xmath0 phase v at high pressures @xcite and it can be viewed as a partially collapsed version of sio@xmath0 @xmath8-cristobalite @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of silicon disulfide at pressures higher than 6 gpa remains unknown experimentally .",
    "evers @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite reasonably hypothesized that at higher pressures such as 10 - 20 gpa , sis@xmath0 might adopt a six - fold , octahedral si coordination , accompanying a density increase",
    ". an alternative scenario might be the creation of a denser tetrahedral phase such as coesite in sio@xmath0 .",
    "work is clearly needed to explore the high pressure phases of sis@xmath0 . while of course future experimental work is called for , experience of the last decade",
    "has shown that state - of - the - art density - functional based crystal structure search can be extremely predictive .    by means of a well - tested , highly reliable protocol consisting of @xmath1 @xmath2 electronic structure calculations combined with evolutionary search for crystal structure prediction @xcite and with constant - pressure molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    ", we undertook a fresh theoretical exploration of high - pressure phases of sis@xmath0 up to 100 gpa . while confirming first of all the presence and stability of the known low - pressure tetrahedral phases , our study predicts three new structures with octahedral , six - fold si coordination at higher pressures . while that confirms previous expectations , the surprise is that the new structures are layered .",
    "we analyze their structural and electronic properties in detail at all pressures , including properties of a single octahedral monolayer which is predicted to survive in a metastable state , should one succeed to shear off and exfoliate it away from the bulk layered structure . more generally , these findings suggest the idea to create , shear and possibly stabilize one or more sis@xmath0 semiconducting monolayers with over 2 ev band gap on a substrate in some future realizations .",
    "from the extensive evolutionary search up to 100 gpa , md simulations and structural optimizations ( details given in methods ) we found three most promising candidates for high - pressure phases of sis@xmath0 beyond 6 gpa .",
    "these three lowest - enthalpy phases have space groups @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 - fig . [ all ] and are very similar to each other",
    ". they all consistently emerged at every investigated pressure ( 10 , 30 , 60 and 100 gpa ) in the evolutionary search .",
    "all three are layered , formed by separate sheets of edge - sharing sis@xmath4 octahedra with different stacking - fig .",
    "[ all ] . the layered character , which is of potential interest in view of a possibly facile frictional sliding under high - pressure shear , is remarkable , since in most materials one tends to associate higher density with  more 3d  networks - precisely the trend observed in the sis@xmath0 tetrahedral region ( from np to hp1 , hp2 and hp3 between 0 and 4 gpa ) .",
    "phase ( c6 structure ) of sis@xmath0 with one sheet per unit cell .",
    "polyhedral view visualized by vesta @xcite shows interbonded edge - sharing octahedra forming individual sheets . ]    in these novel layered phases each of the octahedra shares six out of its twelve edges with six surrounding octahedra .",
    "the most stable phase is @xmath3 - shown in fig .",
    "[ p-3m1 ] and in fig .",
    "[ all ] ( left pictures ) , which contains only one sis@xmath0 unit in the primitive cell .",
    "it is isostructural to cdi@xmath0 ( c6 structure ) @xcite where sheets are stacked directly above each other .",
    "the same structure is found at ambient pressure in chemically similar systems with heavier atoms such as sns@xmath0 @xcite or site@xmath0 @xcite as well as in several other chalcogenides , iodides , chlorides and bromides @xcite , or even in beh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the second lowest - enthalpy phase @xmath11 contains two layers per unit cell which are mutually staggered and reflected with respect to each other - fig .",
    "[ all ] ( middle pictures ) .",
    "finally , the least stable @xmath12 phase shown in fig .",
    "[ all ] ( right pictures ) contains three sheets per unit cell and its structure is identical to ambient - conditions cdcl@xmath0 .    the stacking pattern of the structures is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ all ] by lateral ( upper pictures ) and axial ( lower pictures ) views with respect to sheets .",
    "the arrangement of sheets in all three phases may be represented by specifying the stacking pattern of individual single - atomic layers of si and s atoms , as far as these form planes of closed - packed atoms that are placed regularly one on top of another . the stacking pattern of the @xmath3 structure in this single - atom layer notation is @xmath13 @xcite , while for @xmath11 it is @xmath14 and for @xmath12 it is @xmath15 , where small letters denote layers of si atoms and capital letters are for planes of s atoms ( see legend in fig . [ all ] lateral view on @xmath3 ) .",
    "structural data of the three phases at 10 gpa , their densities and band gaps calculated with generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) are summarized in table [ data ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ elastic ]    elastic constants @xmath16 ( in voigt notation ) listed in table [ elastic ] were calculated at fixed volumes corresponding to zero pressure and at @xmath17 = 0 k. the table also shows point groups of our investigated phases and their corresponding laue groups as well as the respective symmetry relations between elastic constants and elastic stability conditions . for all structures",
    "there is about a factor of eight difference in the value of @xmath18 ( corresponding to the direction perpendicular to planes ) with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "this indicates highly anisotropic mechanical properties as expected for layered systems .",
    "all three investigated structures were found to be mechanically stable at zero pressure by fulfilling the necessary and sufficient born stability conditions for their corresponding laue groups @xcite , which come from the requirement of positive definiteness of the @xmath16 matrix .",
    "therefore , recovery of these phases in a metastable state at ambient pressure is at least conceptually possible .",
    "the dynamical and elastic stability of the @xmath3 layered phase at all pressures down to zero has several consequences .",
    "first , it should be possible to shear the layers relatively easily , as one does in graphite and in mos@xmath0 .",
    "again by similarity , one can hypothesize the possibility to exfoliate a single octahedral sis@xmath0 monolayer from bulk @xmath3 and recover it at ambient conditions .",
    "to pursue this idea , we carried out a separate study of an sis@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "after geometrical optimization in a cell with 15  vacuum between monolayers , we calculated its electronic structure along @xmath20=0 path - fig .",
    "[ monolayer ] .",
    "the band structure shows that the monolayer is again an indirect semiconductor with gap of about 2.4 ev .",
    "in addition , we also calculated phonon dispersions of the monolayer and , as in the case of 3d layered octahedral phases , we found no imaginary modes indicating its dynamical and mechanical stability in isolation .",
    "tetrahedral monolayer taken as one layer from hp1-sis@xmath0 has an indirect band gap larger than 3 ev .",
    "structure and result of md at 60 gpa and 500 k. planes arising from irregularly connected octahedra are well - visible from the dynamical simulations . ]    as in all first - order transitions , the transformation from non - layered to layered structures will proceed by nucleation . while nucleation is in itself extremely slow and hard to simulate ,",
    "much can still be learned about the local mechanism of transformation by means of variable cell constant - pressure _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics @xcite which artificially permits the transformation to take place uniformly and in extremely short times .",
    "we therefore conducted @xmath21 @xmath1 @xmath2 md simulations starting from the initial structure of hp3-sis@xmath0 for 48 and for 96 atoms at low pressure and room temperature and continuing by increasing pressure and temperature . in both sizes",
    "we observed a chemical reorganization into fully octahedral forms - at the pressure of 60 gpa and temperature 600 k for the 96-atomic system and at 50 gpa and 500 k for the 48-atomic system .",
    "the initial transformations led to irregular connectivity pattern of the sis@xmath4 units , which shared edges and corners and also contained unpaired s atoms . upon further compression of the 48-atomic system to 60 gpa at 500 k , the octahedra shifted and rotated , transforming into an incompletely layered state with numerous defects",
    "nevertheless , a strong resemblance to the @xmath11 phase that contains two sheets per unit cell is visible from the polyhedral view of @xmath11 structure and md result at 60 gpa - fig .",
    "[ md ] .",
    "md calculations therefore confirm the existence of octahedral sis@xmath0 with layered character at high pressures , even though due to the limited time scales of @xmath1 @xmath2 md simulations , proper defectless crystalline structures were not fully recovered .",
    "an additional reason for incomplete transition observed in md in this specific case might be the fact that the hp3 phase , which should transform into @xmath3 , is not layered , but fully three - dimensional . the transformation into octahedral",
    "geometry starts at random places in the ( simulation ) sample and the emerging octahedral arrangement of silicon and sulfur atoms formed within the initial chemical reaction then remains mostly unchanged in further evolution at the picosecond time scale .",
    "only a substantial diffusion of certain si atoms could create proper two - dimensional sheets from irregularly connected octahedra , and therefore the original disordered polyhedral state remains stable on the accessible @xmath1 @xmath2 time scale .    from the observed results , it can be predicted that the transformation from hp3 ( or hp2 ) to @xmath3 phase possibly proceeds in two stages - chemical and topological .",
    "the first , chemical stage is the transformation of distorted tetrahedra of hp3 into octahedra , which lasted only about 2 ps in our simulations . in the second , topological stage ,",
    "octahedra must shift and rotate in order to properly organize into individual layers , but during this process some atoms must diffuse over distances that are larger than distances of second - nearest neighbors , which in a solid material takes considerably longer time than the initial chemical reaction .",
    "these results and conclusions are important in two respects .",
    "first , they probably explain why hp3 may have been created and survived experimentally even though metastable with respect to layered @xmath3 . in turn , they support the possibility that layered @xmath3 , once created , might survive as a metastable phase once brought down to lower or even zero pressure .          finally , we should comment on structural similarities among the isovalent compounds co@xmath0 , cs@xmath0 , sio@xmath0 and sis@xmath0 .",
    "with hindsight , before the advent of efficient crystal structure prediction techniques it was customary to argue based on assumption of similarity of the tetrahedral structures , in particular to those of well - known sio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "with the current knowledge of phase diagrams many such arguments no longer stand . in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagrams ] we show the diagrams of the @xmath17=0 stable structures of the four compounds in a wide range of pressures up to 200 gpa . restricting to these stable structures",
    "there is in reality only a limited amount of similarity .",
    "the only tetrahedral structures that are stable in more than one compound are the monoclinic @xmath6 ( whose existence in cs@xmath0 is predicted , even not yet experimentally demonstrated ) and tetragonal @xmath7 ( if it is indeed stable and not metastable in sis@xmath0 and stable in cs@xmath0 , which also remains to be experimentally demonstrated ) . considering also metastable structures , the only tetrahedral structure which seems to be universal at least topologically is the @xmath8-cristobalite structure which is found in its ideal cubic form as a metastable phase of sio@xmath0 and in its distorted form @xmath7 stable in co@xmath0 and stable or metastable in sis@xmath0 ( possibly stable in cs@xmath0 too ) .",
    "surprisingly , the lowest amount of structural similarity to other compounds is found in sio@xmath0 while the highest is seen in sis@xmath0 and cs@xmath0 . in particular , the well - known quartz structure , which in its @xmath22-form represents the stable form of sio@xmath0 at ambient pressure ,",
    "does not seem to be realized in stable form anywhere else ; and the same is true for the coesite structure .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that simple analogies are of limited value if used as heuristic guide in the family of binary compounds that we considered , and probably also elsewhere .",
    "in summary , we predicted by a highly reliable theoretical protocol three new low - enthalpy high - pressure phases of sis@xmath0 , namely @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 by means of @xmath1 @xmath2 structure searching method based on evolutionary algorithm .",
    "these three novel phases are all formed by sis@xmath4 octahedral units forming separate sheets and differ only by the stacking pattern of the layers .",
    "all phases are predicted to become more stable than the tetrahedral forms beyond 4 gpa at zero temperature and remain to be the three most stable structures up to at least 100 gpa , out of all structures found . upon increase of pressure sis@xmath0 therefore undergoes an interesting evolution as far as the dimensionality is concerned - tetrahedral structures transform from 1d to 2d to 3d and after transition to octahedral structure it settles on a 2d layered character .",
    "the associated density increase for tetrahedral - to - octahedral transformation is predicted to be around 20% at 4 gpa showing a strong first - order nature of the transition .",
    "the associated high barriers , and the large reorganization demanded by the transformation suggests the possibility to recover the new phases in metastable form even at ambient conditions . within the employed calculation scheme , the hp3 phase appears to be metastable at zero temperature .",
    "enthalpies of the layered octahedral phases are very similar at lower pressures , which indicates a possible presence of a layered structure with irregular stacking of sheets at experimental conditions . in constant - pressure molecular dynamics simulations , the spontaneous appearance of octahedral geometry starting from an initial tetrahedral one was also observed at 50 gpa , even though the resulting octahedral structure remained mostly disorganized due to short simulation times accessible in first - principles studies .",
    "all three low - enthalpy octahedral polymorphs are semiconductors with indirect  2 ev order band gaps at low pressures , values potentially interesting for layered compound applications .",
    "they metallize around 40 gpa and remain relatively poor metals up to 100 gpa .",
    "the @xmath3 phase is dynamically stable from zero pressure up to at least 1 mbar from phonon calculations .",
    "elastic stability of all phases was also confirmed at zero pressure and the calculated elastic constants indicate highly anisotropic mechanical properties typical for layered structures .",
    "calculations also suggest that single octahedral layers could possibly be exfoliated from bulk @xmath3-sis@xmath0 once quenched to ambient conditions , as far as the monolayer is predicted to be dynamically stable once formed .",
    "results presented in this study may be useful in order to compare the future experimental compression products with the ideal phases found in our structural search . on account of their layered nature",
    ", the application of high - pressure shear may suffice to cause interlayer sliding , with transformations and the appearance of new polytype phases . comparing the @xmath17=0 phase diagrams of selected group iv - vi ab@xmath0 systems",
    "shows that structural similarities between these isovalent compounds are in fact rather limited .",
    "we employed the open - source evolutionary algorithm package for crystal structure prediction xtalopt @xcite and carried out searches at 10 , 30 , 60 and at 100 gpa with 6 and 12 atom cells ( 2 and 4 structural units ) for each pressure , enabling generation of at least 1000 structures in each case .",
    "all underlying _ ab initio _ electronic calculations were performed with the density functional theory ( dft ) vasp 5.3 and 5.4 codes @xcite employing projector augmented - wave pseudopotentials @xcite and perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization of gga exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "pressures above 100 gpa could not be , and were not , addressed with these pseudopotentials .",
    "the randomly generated initial structures of the evolutionary search and those created after various mutations were initially optimized in static cells ( where only ions were relaxed ) and within coarse @xmath23-point grids .",
    "thereafter , structures were relaxed in fixed - volume geometry ( ions and cell shapes were relaxed ) with a finer @xmath23-points mesh .",
    "finally , full ionic and cell degrees of freedom relaxations were carried out with finest @xmath23-point sampling in order to refine the final structures . during this progressive structural optimization ,",
    "the energy cutoff was also gradually increased from 340 to 400 ev .    in order to describe the dispersion forces that must be included for the obtained layered phases , especially in the low - pressure region",
    ", we employed the parameter - free tkatchenko - scheffler approach dft - ts @xcite , in which dispersion coefficients and damping functions of the original grimme s method @xcite are charge - density dependent .",
    "the dispersion forces are therefore described adaptively accounting for changing electronic structure upon compression . to investigate electronic structure of octahedral sis@xmath4 , we employed the hse06 hybrid functional @xcite , which tends to provide more reliable results for the band gap estimate and electronic structure of solids compared to pbe .",
    "the second - order elastic stiffness constants @xmath16 were calculated using vasp by a two - steps procedure , in which the stress tensor is determined for both distorted supercells without relaxing the ions and for undistorted supercells with separately shifted ions @xcite . for each phase , we used 21 different values of strain - from 0.005 to 0.025 in 0.001 intervals and from these , only results that were quite similar ( formed plateaus on @xmath16 vs. strain dependences ) were used to obtain final average - this was from strain values 0.015 to 0.02 for @xmath3 phase , between 0.011 - 0.021 for the case of @xmath11 and for 0.013 - 0.016 interval for @xmath12 .",
    "from the final elastic tensor of each phase , individual @xmath16 constants were extracted by requirements of symmetry according to each of the phases laue groups @xcite .",
    "for example , if , say , @xmath24 should by symmetry be equal to @xmath25 , then @xmath24 was taken to be ( @xmath24 + @xmath25)/2 , and so on .",
    "elastic constants for all phases were calculated at zero temperature at volumes corresponding to zero pressure and with the use of grimme s van der waals correction ( dft - d2 ) @xcite .",
    "phonon dispersion curves were calculated in the harmonic approximation by the supercell method using the phonopy code @xcite .",
    "a @xmath26 supercell ( 432 atoms ) for the @xmath3 phase , a @xmath27 supercell ( 432 atoms ) for the @xmath11 phase and a @xmath27 supercell ( 648 atoms ) for @xmath12 phase were used for calculations of force constant matrices with phonopy .",
    "correctness of the dispersion curves was also tested in some important cases by independent calculations using density functional perturbation theory as employed in the quantum espresso package @xcite .",
    "md simulations were performed in the constant pressure - temperature _ npt _ ensemble with the use of parrinello - rahman barostat @xcite and langevin stochastic thermostat @xcite .",
    "the simulation samples contained 48 and 96 atoms and the supercells were generated as @xmath28 and @xmath29 unit - cells of the hp3-sis@xmath0 structure . the time step for md was set to 2 fs .",
