    "it extends almost directly west , while the northern west stream extends first northwest and then curves toward the northeast ( figure [ fig : regions ] ) .",
    "the northwest plume is also @xmath190.06 magnitudes redder mag uncertainty , due to the stability of the background corrections . ]",
    "than the adjacent west streams ( table [ table : m51 ] ; we note that the plume shows a uniform color from end to end ) , implying distinct ( albeit similar ) stellar populations .",
    "@xcite also note bimodality in the pne velocities northwest of m51 ( although not cospatial with the plume ) , arguing for kinematically distinct populations .",
    "indeed , we note a possible third component , a slight protrusion just to the northwest of m51a ( marked with an arrow in figure [ fig : regions ] ) which may be a stellar stream overlapping m51a s outer disk .",
    "the things map of m51 @xcite also shows gas extending roughly in this direction .",
    "there is very little high column density associated with the northwest plume ( figure [ fig : gascomp ] ) , but evidence exists for extremely diffuse , high - velocity gas in the vicinity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* pisano private communication ) .",
    "diffuse associated with the northwest plume would also imply an origin with the gas - rich spiral m51a , as the companion galaxy m51b appears to be extremely gas - poor .",
    "dynamically , the northwest plume appears several hundred myrs old ; its linear extent ( @xmath1940 kpc in projection ) would require an unrealistic expansion velocity if , for example , it had formed during the most recent passage proposed by @xcite ( 50 to 100 myr ago ) or @xcite ( 70 myr ago ) . at the rotation speed of m51a ( 210 km / s ;",
    "* ) , a timescale of @xmath19200 myr is more likely .",
    "we have also used stellar population modeling @xcite to show the plume is dominated by old stars . exponentially declining star formation histories typical of sb / sc galaxies ( @xmath2059 gyr )",
    "produce colors too blue ( @xmath21 ) to match the plume ; its red color demands much older star formation histories ( @xmath203 gyr ) .",
    "similarly , any subsequent interaction - induced star formation in the plume must be weak ( @xmath225% of the plume s stellar mass ) , else the colors would too blue by @xmath23 0.15 mags even after 500 myr .",
    "as dust extinction appears negligible due to the low gas column density @xcite , our inference of old stellar populations appears sound .    partially overlapping with the northwest plume , but with contrasting morphology and color , are the east and west streams .",
    "both streams are bifurcated , and all branches have very similar colors ( @xmath24 ) , which are in turn similar to m51b s average color ( @xmath25 ; * ? ? ?",
    "given this , and the streams symmetry around and proximity to m51b , it seems likely that these streams originated from that galaxy s disk .",
    "a variety of processes may give rise to bifurcated tidal streams , including kinematic caustics @xcite and differences in the kinematic evolution of the gas and stellar components @xcite . in the latter mechanism",
    ", stellar bifurcations would only arise via subsequent star formation in the displaced gas tail , which would then show younger stellar populations than the collisionless tail .",
    "the lack of and the uniformly red colors of these streams would seem to argue against such a scenario in m51b , and instead favor collisionless kinematic caustics .    based on the colors shown in figure [ fig : color ] , much of the crown north of m51b also appears associated with the companion , excepting the bluer middle prong .",
    "@xcite showed that the latter is an extension of m51a s northern tidal arm ; indeed , its color is similar to that of the southeast tail ( b@xmath26v=0.64 ) , the blueness of which is expected from its origin in m51a s disk .",
    "we also note the incredible sharpness of the ridge formed by the crown s eastern prong , indicative of a strong caustic .    in the southeast tail ,",
    "the clear separation between the gas and stars ( figure [ fig : gascomp ] , noted previously by @xcite and @xcite ) is of particular interest .",
    "the stellar tail curves sharply northward and disappears into the tidal detritus near the east streams , while the more loosely wrapped tail is much more extended and contains no diffuse stellar counterpart down to our limit of @xmath9@xmath27 .",
    "simulations have shown that such gas / star offsets in tidal tails can arise from differences in the radial extent of the two components in the pre - encounter disk @xcite , where the stellar component of a tail consists preferentially of material with low specific angular momentum and thus `` trails '' the high angular momentum gaseous tail . while this may explain the tail s lack of an old stellar population , the lack of either ongoing star formation @xcite or a young stellar population is more challenging , as the compressive nature of tidal interactions",
    "is known to form massive star clusters and tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite in many tidal tails .",
    "the lack of a young population in m51 s tail may indicate a highly inclined encounter , where compressive forces in the tail are greatly reduced . as shown by @xcite",
    ", an inclined encounter also explains the tail s observed counter - rotation , and is reproduced well by interaction models of @xcite .",
    "aside from the structure of the tidal features , our data also shed light on the structure of m51a s outer disk .",
    "the colors get redder by 0.20.4 magnitudes outside of the spiral arm region , visible in the colormap of figure [ fig : color ] and explicitly in figure [ fig : profs ] , which shows photometric profiles along an elliptical wedge which follows the curvature of the outermost spiral arm westward into the outer disk .",
    "we see a dramatic drop in surface brightness between 220  and 250 , corresponding precisely with a change in the b@xmath26v  color from 0.46 to 0.65 ( roughly , the integrated colors of an sc and sa galaxy , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "this region marks the edge of the outermost spiral arm ; beyond , the redward gradient continues , ultimately reaching colors similar to those of m51b .",
    "the dramatic drop in surface brightness is similar to the arm - interarm contrast measured in the same region in m51a by @xcite , and seen in the outer regions of other spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the red colors , smooth surface brightness profile , and round outer isophotes in this region might be interpreted as marking the transition to a kinematically hot spheroidal component , but we reject this notion for a variety of reasons .",
    "m51a lacks a strong bulge ( ( b : t)@xmath28 = 0.27 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , arguing that the outer component is not likely to be extended bulge light .",
    "furthermore , such a bright halo component is unlikely given the radius ( @xmath19 10 kpc ) and surface brightness ( @xmath29 ) of the component ; by comparison , m31 s smooth halo has the much fainter surface brightness of @xmath30@xmath31 at 10kpc ( extrapolating from the power law fits of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the most reasonable interpretation for this component is that we are simply seeing the outer , redder stellar disk in m51a .    an outer disk origin for this light",
    "is also suggested by its similarity in color to the more extended northwest plume .",
    "the linear structure of the plume would require a dynamical origin from material with coherent motion and high angular momentum , as would be found in an outer disk .",
    "such disks are also expected to show redder colors due to effects from radial migration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such colors are frequently observed in outer disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* who found typical outer disk colors of @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 in @xmath35 ) .",
    "hence , it seems likely that the red outer regions of m51a are simply part of its outer disk , and that the northwest plume may have been ejected from the outer disk during the interaction .",
    "simulations of the m51 system fall broadly into two classes : parabolic single - pass models with typical timescales of @xmath36 myr @xcite , and more tightly bound , multiple passage models with one encounter several hundred myr ago , and a second passage @xmath37100 myr ago @xcite .",
    "in general , these models were developed to match the structure and kinematics of the and the bright tidal debris ( the east and west streams and southern tail ) .",
    "the degree to which they successfully reproduce the fainter , more extended debris ( the northwest , northeast , and south plumes ) is less clear .",
    "here we develop new insights gleaned from a comparison between our deep imaging data and the existing simulations .",
    "perhaps most useful is a comparison involving the northwest plume .",
    "similar features arise in simulations of m51 from the material nearest the companion at pericenter , which receives the most dispersive tidal kick and is ejected as a broad tidal plume ( in contrast , material on the opposite side of the disk forms a coherent tidal tail ) .",
    "tidal features resembling the northwest plume appear in a variety of m51 simulations , but single - passage models tend to reproduce the plume s morphology better than the best - fit multipassage models of @xcite or @xcite : see , for example , figures 1 and 8 of @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , we note that both @xcite and @xcite elaborate on only one such model ; different parameters in a multi - passage encounter may reproduce the feature more effectively . while the northwest plume can not unambiguously differentiate between the model classes , the dynamical age implied by its linear extent",
    "argues that the initial passage of this encounter ( or the sole passage ) must have taken place at least a few hundred myr ago ( in more agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the other faint features ",
    "the northeast and south plumes  have no clear analogues in any published simulation . the northeast plume",
    "perhaps most resembles the diffuse northern component seen in the multiple passage models by @xcite .",
    "single passage models generally completely fail to reproduce this northern component @xcite , so the presence of both the crown and this northeast plume seem to favor the multiple - passage models . indeed , this feature may simply be a faint outer extension of material in the crown itself ; its low luminosity ( @xmath38 ) would place it below the mass resolution of most published simulations , and could explain why they miss this feature .",
    "the south plume , on the other hand , shows no morphological continuity with any adjacent feature , either in optical or in , and has no counterpart in any simulation published to date .",
    "while @xcite detected some diffuse on the galaxy s southwestern side , it does not overlap with the south plume itself .",
    "given all this , the plume would seem to be either a distinct tidal feature not replicated in previous dynamical modeling ( although like the northeast plume , it may be too low mass to discern in published simulations ) , or the remains of a disrupted low luminosity dwarf galaxy in the system .    regarding the southeast tail , the lack of an old , co - spatial stellar component may argue that the gas came from an extended gas - rich disk belonging to m51a .",
    "simulations of the m51 system favor a highly inclined encounter to explain the kinematics of the tail @xcite ; such a configuration would suppress caustic formation in the tail and explain its paucity of star formation and young stars . however , the gas / star offset observed in the tail is still problematic , as such features should be most prominent in highly prograde encounters where the orbital and rotational angular momentum is well - aligned @xcite .",
    "thus the data still leave some ambiguity in the dynamical evolution of the southeast tail .    in summary , no single model of m51",
    "provides a perfect match to the additional constraints derived from our imaging .",
    "the single - passage models appear to better reproduce the diffuse northwest plume , while the multi - passage models reproduce better the diffuse northern material ( the crown and northeast plume ) .",
    "no simulations to date have produced anything resembling the south plume , although its low luminosity suggests that higher resolution simulations may be necessary to model its structure .",
    "the lack of a stellar counterpart in m51 s southeast hi tail argues that the tail was drawn almost exclusively from the outermost , gas - rich regions of m51a s disk , or that extensive kinematic segregation of stars and gas has occurred , without triggering any wide - spread star formation in the tidally stripped gas .",
    "future modeling campaigns thus are warranted , and have a variety of new constraints and challenges ahead .",
    "new simulations must recover the newly discovered tidal plumes , ensure that the northwest plume is correctly oriented and gas - free , reproduce the strong offset between the stars and gas in the southeast tail , and bifurcate m51b s east and west streams .",
    "successful simulations will then be able to pin down the timescale and geometry of the encounter  critical inputs to studies of spiral structure , ism evolution , and star formation in this classic interacting system ."
