    "this particular directionality has been inherited from 1 ) the binary equation ( [ eqlens ] ) where the lens axis is along the real axis and 2 ) the implicit assumption in the derviation of equation ( [ eqshear ] ) that the larger mass was in the positive direction . in general , the constant shear coefficient @xmath175 would be a complex number @xmath176 half whose phase angle points to the effective direction of the larger mass that generates the constant shear .",
    "it is noteworthy that the second term in equation ( [ eqleqshear ] ) due to the ( microarcsecond ) lensing star is also a shear term , and this shear term vanishes at @xmath177  far away from the mass that generates the shear .",

    "it is in a sense a reminder that constant shear is inherently an expression of approximation , and the lens equation with a constant shear should be treated as an incomplete equation which requires auxiliary assumptions or interpretations to be a physically viable model for a lensing system .",

    "in fact , the critical curve can pass through the infinity and the image at infinity can be infinitely bright .",

    "the interpretation of @xcite that @xmath285 is the  vertical distance \" is an erroneous misinterpretation .",

    "we find that the second equation of sef.6.17 has a mistake . by",
    "now , we have a clear understanding that when we expand the lens equation in the neighborhood of an arbitrary non - preferred caustic point , there will be terms describing a migration along the critical curve .",
    "the condition for migration is @xmath291 , and so we expect @xmath292 .",
    "if the two equations in sef.6.17 are compared ( @xmath207 is correct ) , it should be clear that the missing term is @xmath293 in our notation .",
    "the fault is at the truncation prescription in the first paragraph in sef.p.189 .",
    "if we look at the rhs of equation ( 12 ) , the most dominant term is @xmath294 term , and so @xmath295 .",
    "we know that that is exactly the case , namely @xmath296 , when the origin is the preferred caustic point and so there is no migration along the critical curve .",
    "if we look at equation ( 11 ) , it is clear that the dominant term in the rhs is @xmath294 term and so @xmath110 is linear in @xmath107 and @xmath106 as is shown in equation ( 14 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath297 , and they are sufficiently smaller than 1 ( einstein ring radius ) .",
    "incidentally , that is why @xmath112 is much larger than the other three , and images across the critical curve are tangentially stretched large . since the migration condition is linear in @xmath110 and @xmath112 , we expect @xmath112 to be made of terms of two different orders : @xmath298 and linear terms in @xmath107 and @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , all the terms up to the second order in @xmath106 ( so , @xmath299 ) should be kept to calcualte @xmath112 from the second equation of sef.6.17 .",

    "2 .   one may suggest to ignore the linear term in @xmath106 because that is smaller than @xmath298 term .",
    "one problem is that the linear term in @xmath106 does not have any reason to be small in comparison to the linear term in @xmath107 , which is reflected in the first equation in sef.6.17 . in other words",

    "if one cosmetically interprets the erroneous expression , one can be led to the erroneous conclusion on the distance drawn by @xcite .",
    "the fault may lie in that the apparent relevance of the _ vertical distance _ which may have been a pleasing discovery for a brief moment has not been tested through the routine logical digestion process necessary for a meaningful claim and has been put forward as a fact .",
    "the correct relevant distance is the _ normal component _",
    "@xmath303 where the normal direction is given by the critical direction at the origin where the functional definition of the origin derives from that that is where the taylor ( or power ) expansion is made .",

    "the substitution @xmath304 in those equations should be replaced by the correct substitution @xmath305 .",
    "@xcite emphasized to have worked out in ( 2-d ) real variables .",
    "they made an erroneous conclusion and kindly warned the readers accordingly , _  there are not many people who know that the distance is the ",
    "vertical distance\". _ this claim may imply a correlation between the error and the choice of variables , but that is not the case .",
    "the missing term in the second equation of sef.6.17 could have been recovered if one had stared at the two equations of sef.6.17 and scratched the head about the meanings of the linear terms in comparison to the square root terms . in our humble belief , ( astro)physically meaningful quantities have intrinsic values ( many times as the form of geometric quantities ) and offer intuitive understanding .",
