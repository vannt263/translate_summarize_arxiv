    "duality is one of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum field theory .",
    "it provides an alternative , often non - perturbative , understanding of the theory that is not accessible in the original description .",
    "seiberg duality @xcite , under which weakly coupled gauge theory is mapped into strongly coupled one with different rank , and vice versa , is a prominent example .",
    "although the mapping of local operators under seiberg duality is known to be rather simple @xcite , the transformation properties of non - local operators , such as wilson loops , are more non - trivial and less studied .    by its strong - weak nature",
    ", any checks of seiberg duality must involve a non - perturbative approach .",
    "the localization method @xcite is a powerful technique applicable to supersymmetric field theory and reduces the infinite dimensional path integral of quantum field theory to a finite integral which can be often regarded as a matrix model integral .",
    "this method allows for exact computation of quantities such as partition function and wilson loops at strong coupling , and is an ideal tool for studying non - perturbative physics such as seiberg duality .    among various supersymmetric gauge theories calculable by the localization method , we focus on the three - dimensional @xmath12 supersymmetric @xmath13 chern - simons - matter ( csm ) theory , known as the abj theory @xcite , where @xmath14 is the chern - simons level . in the special case with @xmath15 , this theory",
    "is called the abjm theory @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the @xmath16 abj theory gives the low - energy description of the system of @xmath17 m2-branes and @xmath18 fractional m2-branes probing @xmath19 , and its holographic dual geometry is ads@xmath20 in m - theory or ads@xmath21 in type iia superstring @xcite .",
    "it is also conjectured that this theory has another dual description in terms of the @xmath22 supersymmetric , parity - violating version of the vasiliev higher spin theory in four dimensions @xcite .    applying the localization method to the abj(m ) theory on @xmath23 yields @xcite the so - called abj(m ) matrix model , which has been extensively studied recently and led to much insight into the non - perturbative effects in the theory .",
    "for instance , applying the standard large @xmath17 technique to the abj matrix model reproduced the @xmath24 scaling of the free energy expected from the gravity dual @xcite .",
    "for the abjm theory , the @xmath25 corrections were summed to all orders using holomorphic anomaly equation at large t hooft coupling @xmath26 in the type iia regime @xmath27 and an airy function behavior was found @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the powerful fermi gas approach was developed and reproduced the airy function in the m - theory regime ( large @xmath17 , finite @xmath4)@xcite .",
    "based on the fermi gas approach , instanton corrections were examined @xcite and a cancellation mechanism between worldsheet and membrane ( d2 ) instantons was discovered .",
    "more recently , the fermi gas approach was generalized to the abj theory in @xcite and further studied in @xcite . in a different line of development , in @xcite , the abj matrix model was rewritten in a form generalizing the `` mirror description '' for the abjm theory @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by starting with the @xmath28 lens space matrix model @xcite which is exactly computable and analytically continuing it by sending @xmath29 to reach the abj matrix model . as a result",
    ", partition function was written as a @xmath30-dimensional contour integral and the residue it picks up can be given an interpretation of perturbative or non - perturbative contribution , according to its @xmath4 dependence . later",
    ", this mirror expression was reproduced in a more direct way in @xcite .",
    "this formulation is particularly suitable for studying the duality with the higher spin theory @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the abj theory has seiberg duality , which states that the following two theories are equivalent : @xmath31 where we assumed @xmath32 .",
    "this duality can be understood in the brane realization of the abj theory @xcite as moving 5-branes past each other and creating / annihilating d3-branes between them by the hanany - witten effect @xcite .",
    "it is a special case of the giveon - kutasov duality @xcite for more general @xmath33 cs - matter theories , which can be regarded as the three - dimensional analog of the four - dimensional seiberg duality @xcite .",
    "the equality of the partition function ( up to a phase ) between the dual theories in was proven in @xcite , although one mathematical relation was assumed . on the other hand , in the `` mirror '' framework of @xcite , the equality of the dual partition function",
    "is more or less obvious @xcite and , moreover , it was observed that the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions get exchanged into each other under the duality .",
    "wilson loops are the only observables in pure cs theory @xcite and , even in cs - matter theory , they are very natural objects to consider .",
    "it is known that there are two basic circular supersymmetric wilson loops for the abj(m ) theory on @xmath23 ; the wilson loop carrying a non - trivial representation with respect to one of the two gauge groups preserves @xmath34 of supersymmetry @xcite while an appropriate combination of @xmath34-bps wilson loops for two gauge groups preserves @xmath35 of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the bulk dual of the @xmath36-bps wilson loop is a fundamental string while the bulk dual of the @xmath37-bps wilson loop is not completely understood @xcite . for more discussion . ] by the localization method , these wilson loops can be computed using the abj(m ) matrix model @xcite , and the techniques developed for partition function to study non - perturbative effects can be generalized to wilson loops , such as the large @xmath17 analysis @xcite , the fermi gas approach @xcite , and the cancellation between worldsheet and membrane instantons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the @xmath34 and @xmath35-bps wilson loops and their seiberg duality in the abj theory , based on the approach developed in @xcite for partition function .",
    "we mainly focus on the representations with winding number @xmath38 . starting with wilson loops in lens space matrix model and analytically continuing it , we obtain a new expression for the supersymmetric wilson loops in the abj theory in terms of @xmath39-dimensional contour integrals . as an application and as a way to check the consistency of our formula , we study seiberg duality on the abj wilson loops . the duality rule for wilson loops",
    "is highly non - trivial because they are non - local operators and not charged under the global symmetry .",
    "how to find given - kutasov duality relations for wilson loops in general @xmath33 cs - matter theories , of which the abj theory is a special case , was proposed in @xcite based on quantum algebraic relations .",
    "we derive the duality rule of the supersymmetric wilson loops using our integral expression and confirm that it is consistent with the proposal of @xcite .",
    "we also discuss how the perturbative and non - perturbative effects are mapped under seiberg duality .",
    "moreover , we provide a heuristic explanation of the duality rule from the brane realization of the abj theory . in an appropriate duality frame",
    ", the wilson loop is interpreted as the position of the branes and , carefully following how the hanany - witten effect acts on it , we reproduce the correct duality rule .",

    "becomes @xmath836 since this is identical to , we obtain the identity : @xmath837 this equation must hold for any representation of bps wilson loops and then yields the operator identity @xmath838 where we introduced @xmath839 . for later convenience , we rewrite this as @xmath840 note that this polynomial is at most of order @xmath841 .",
    "in step 3 , seiberg duality of the wilson loops is extracted from the transformation . at @xmath818",
    "we obtain @xmath844 where the subscripts @xmath845 and @xmath846 indicate that the wilson loops are on the first and second gauge group , respectively . in this example , the bps wilson loop of the original @xmath823 theory in the fundamental representation maps to minus that of the dual @xmath847 theory in the fundamental representation shifted by a singlet that depends on the masses @xmath543 s in the dual theory .",
    "case it might look naively that there is an additional identity operator coming from the @xmath848 term that contributes to the duality map . however , the @xmath34-bps wilson loop with winding @xmath38 is only well - defined for @xmath239 and thus the @xmath42 fundamental wilson loop is ill - defined for @xmath849 .",
    "this method is therefore not applicable to the abj theory with @xmath849 .",
    "for the same reason the @xmath850 terms in are meaningless because the @xmath34-bps wilson loops with winding @xmath851 are involved at this order . ]    in order to find the duality maps for the abj theory , we need to integrate over the mass parameters @xmath830 .",
    "the map then becomes @xmath852 in our notation this reads @xmath853 this indeed agrees with .",
    "we can run the same procedure for the flavor wilson loops . since the flavor group is unchanged under seiberg duality , we simply obtain the following map : @xmath854 which reads @xmath855 this agrees with .",
    "finally , the maps and imply that @xmath856 this agrees with .",
    "we have thus succeeded to reproduce seiberg duality for the abj wilson loops with the winding @xmath42 .      from the isomorphism of the wilson loop algebras",
    ", we can also extract the duality transformations for the wilson loops in higher dimensional representations in the abj theory . here",
    "we consider the wilson loops that involve two boxes in young diagrams corresponding to the @xmath857 terms in : @xmath858 integrating over the mass parameters @xmath543 , we find the duality transformation of the antisymmetric wilson loop : @xmath859 where @xmath860 is a fundamental wilson loop with winding @xmath491 and decomposed into @xmath861 using this relation , yields @xmath862 this agrees with the result from the heuristic derivation in the brane picture in section [ branepicturesection ] .",
    "for the flavor wilson loops , we simply have @xmath863",
    "lastly , we consider the wilson loop that is on both gauge groups @xmath864 the map of this wilson loop is obtained from the duality transformation for the fundamental wilson loops : @xmath865 where integration over @xmath341 s is implied . combining , and , we find the map of the @xmath35-bps wilson loop @xmath866 this again agrees with the result in section [ branepicturesection ] .",
    "although it becomes increasingly cumbersome , it is straightforward to generalize this procedure to more general higher dimensional representations .",
    "there is a subtlety for @xmath867 since contains the @xmath848 contribution .",
    "then when we consider the low representation wilson loop , we need include the @xmath848 terms .",
    "first we consider the @xmath849 case . in this case",
    "the wilson loop duality becomes @xmath868      in the electric side , we regard @xmath543 as mass parameters . under the duality mapping we considered that @xmath543 are mapped @xmath869 .",
    "but , is this correct ?",
