    "a device that can transfer electrons one by one or more generally @xmath0 electrons at frequency @xmath1 could be used as a quantum current standard with magnitude @xmath2 .",
    "the first proposals and devices of this kind were based on normal - metal tunnel junctions  @xcite .",
    "the most precise electron pump built todate reached the relative accuracy @xmath3 .",
    "it consisted of a set structure with seven metallic tunnel junctions and six rf - controlled islands between them  @xcite .",
    "it was used as a quantum capacitance standard  @xcite , but the @xmath4 time constants of the tunnel junctions limited the maximum current on picoampere level which is not enough for a practical current standard .",
    "specifically , at least 100  pa is required for closing the so - called quantum metrological triangle .",
    "this experiment compares the electrical quantum standards of voltage , resistance and current against each other via ohm s law .",
    "it yields a consistency check for the fundamental constants @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite . the josephson voltage standard and the quantum - hall resistance standard",
    "are routinely used in metrology institutes worldwide , but the current standard is the missing link .",
    "devices generating higher currents than the set pump , based on superconducting devices  @xcite , surface acoustic waves  @xcite and semiconducting quantum dots  @xcite have been proposed and realized . however",
    ", none of these devices has reached metrological accuracy .    in 2007 , a new concept based on a hybrid set structure was proposed and demonstrated in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid set consists of either superconducting ( s ) leads connected via insulating ( i ) tunnel barriers to a normal - metal ( n ) island or vice versa , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pumppukaavio ] . when a constant bias voltage is applied over the sinis / nisin structure ( e.g.  @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and the electrical potential of the island is controlled with an rf gate voltage signal , the structure acts as a turnstile . in the first experiments",
    "@xcite , a nisin turnstile showed robust current quantization .",
    "theoretically , however , the sinis version promises higher accuracy .",
    "detailed analysis predicts , that metrological accuracy could be reached with the simple sinis structure with only one rf control parameter and two tunnel junctions  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we illustrate the principle of operation of the sinis turnstile .",
    "we present an overview of the error mechanisms and discuss the experimental challenges they pose .",
    "finally , we show experimental results of the sinis turnstile with improved leakage properties .",
    "the tunneling rates of the sinis turnstile are determined by the effects of the coulomb blockade and the electronic structures of the superconductor leads and the normal - metal island .",
    "the latter effect can be understood qualitatively from the energy band diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .",
    "voltage @xmath9 over the structure shifts the fermi levels of the superconductors by @xmath10 . at low temperatures ,",
    "the fermi distribution is almost like a step function .",
    "tunneling can occur between states with same energy .",
    "hence , at low voltages , electrons can not tunnel from the occupied states of the normal metal to the superconductors , where the corresponding energy levels are either forbidden or occupied .",
    "similarly , there are no free states in the normal metal at occupied energy range of the superconductors .",
    "therefore , the bcs gap @xmath11 causes a voltage range @xmath12 where the current through the device is very small .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](b ) , the structure is biased close to the edge of the gap .",
    "electrons can tunnel from the left superconductor to the states slightly below the fermi energy of the normal metal filling cold holes , whereas hot electrons above the fermi level of the normal metal can tunnel to the quasiparticle states of the right superconductor .",
    "the electron - electron interactions maintain the fermi distribution , but it narrows , which means that the normal metal cools down .",
    "indeed , sinis structures are routinely used as microcoolers  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb - blockaded structure used in the sinis turnstile has also been proposed for a radio - frequency single - electron refrigerator @xcite and has been used as a heat transistor  @xcite .",
    "the cooling effect may also improve the accuracy of the turnstile .",
    "the total capacitance of the island is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 refer to the left and right tunnel junctions and to the gate , respectively .",
    "the self - capacitance of the island is @xmath16 .",
    "we normalize all energies by the bcs gap . the normalized charging energy of the island is @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is the number of extra electrons on the island and @xmath18 is the amount of charge in units of @xmath5 induced on the island by the gate .",
    "the unit of charging energy is @xmath19 .",
    "the change in energy for an electron tunneling to ( @xmath20 ) or from ( @xmath21 ) the island through junction @xmath22 is @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the normalized bias voltage of the junction ( see fig .  [",

    "the density of states in the superconductors is ideally @xmath30 .    in the steady state ,",
    "the probability of finding @xmath0 extra electrons on the island , @xmath31 , is constant , and the net probability of transition between adjacent states is zero .",
    "hence , we can solve the steady state from the master equation @xmath32p(n ) = [ \\gamma^{\\mathrm{l},-}(n+1)+\\gamma^{\\mathrm{r},-}(n+1)]p(n+1).\\ ] ] the current through the junction l is simply @xmath33.\\ ] ] in the steady state @xmath34 .    theoretical current - voltage ( iv ) curves calculated with these equations",
    "are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : teoriv](a ) and [ fig : teoriv](b ) for the ninin ( normal set ) and sinis ( hybrid set ) cases , respectively .",
    "the main difference is that the bcs gap enlarges the areas where the charge states are stable and hence the current is ideally zero . on this scale ,",
    "the iv curves of the sinis and nisin structures are the same .",
    "the case of a superconducting ( sisis ) set is not shown here , but it has the significant difference to the presented curves that the supercurrent can pass the structure at zero voltage .    in the literature ,",
    "the density of states in a superconductor is often written as @xmath35 the physical meaning of the @xmath36 parameter is the cooper - pair breaking rate of the superconductor  @xcite . in the absence of coulomb blockade , pair breaking yields a finite linear conductance @xmath37 , and hence a leakage current in the regime @xmath38 .",
    "ideally , the sub - gap conductance would be zero . in the coulomb - blockaded case with gate open , @xmath39 . however , there are also other processes that lead to finite conductance , like the andreev reflection  @xcite .",
    "the details of the leakage processes have usually been neglected , and @xmath36 has been used as a general phenomenological leakage parameter like in ref .",
    "a typical amount of leakage is @xmath40 .",
    "since the extremely low leakage current within the bcs gap is essential for the accuracy of the turnstile , we will discuss the leakage processes in sec .",
    "[ sec : error ] .",
    "the operation of the sinis turnstile can be explained with the help of fig .  [ fig : timantit ] . in the normal case [ fig : timantit](a ) , the stability regions arising from the coulomb interaction barely touch each other . the pumping signal illustrated with the thick",
    "line passes the zone outside the stability regions , where current can flow through the device . without the bias voltage",
    ", there would be no preferred direction of tunneling , e.g.  transition from the state @xmath41 to @xmath42 can occur by tunneling through the left junction in the forward direction or through the right junction in the backward direction . hence , the normal set can not act as a turnstile even in principle .    in the hybrid case shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : timantit](b ) and [ fig : timantit](c ) , the stability regions are expanded by 2 units on the @xmath43 axis and by @xmath44 on the @xmath45 axis . hence , the regions overlap . in the overlapping region",
    ", the system stays in the initial stable state .",
    "now , let us consider the situation , where the device is biased to @xmath46 , and we start to increase @xmath45 from zero to unity .",
    "the device stays in the region , where at least one of the charge states is stable .",
    "the transition from the state 0 to @xmath47 could happen due to an electron tunneling forwards through the left junction or backwards through the right junction .",
    "because of the bias , we meet the threshold for forward tunneling well before that of backward tunneling .",
    "when the gate charge is again reduced to zero , the bias voltage causes a preferred direction of tunneling in a similar fashion .",
    "one can also extend the gate voltage signal to span over several charge states . if , e.g. , the path in fig .",
    "[ fig : timantit ] is extended to @xmath48 , the system would transfer from the state 0 to @xmath49 by two sequential forward tunneling events through the left junction , and then back to the state 0 by two forward events through the right junction . in this process",
    ", two electrons are transferred per cycle .",
    "current plateaus up to @xmath50 were obtained already in the first experiments  @xcite .",
    "one of the key benefits of the hybrid design is that it allows current quantization with a single island .",
    "a pump with @xmath51 islands has @xmath51 unique fluctuating background charges that must be compensated by applying offset voltages to the gate signals .",
    "employing many rf controls to a dilution refrigerator is also a considerable engineering effort . in the hybrid case",
    ", this effort can be used to connect @xmath51 turnstiles in parallel which increases the current and decreases the relative statistical error . also the maximum operation frequency , limited by the @xmath4 time constants , is lowered by the number of junctions .",
    "therefore , the hybrid structures can be used to create roughly @xmath52 times the current of an @xmath51-island pump with the same amount of complexity .",
    "also the normal - state turnstile of ref .",
    "@xcite has a dc bias and only one rf gate control .",
    "however , it requires at least two junctions on each side of the gate - controlled island .",
    "it means that there are at least two extra islands whose charge is either not well defined or they require extra controls .",
    "four junctions can not be biased optimally with the two control parameters  @xcite . in the normal - state turnstile",
    ", dc bias always leads to self - heating unlike in the sinis case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](b ) ) .",
    "the error mechanisms of the sinis turnstile have been analyzed theoretically in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we give a brief overview of them .",
    "the error sources can be divided into three categories : errors related to the pumping speed , thermally activated errors in tunneling , and several kinds of leakage processes .",
    "the turnstile can be operated with any gate waveform oscillating around @xmath53 with amplitude large enough to pass the tunneling thresholds .",
    "an obvious choice is the sine wave , which was used in the first experiments  @xcite , and which is experimentally the easiest to accomplish .",
    "however , a square - wave signal would be optimal , because the time spent between the optimal gate charge values increases the probability of unwanted transitions .",
    "also , the time spent at the extreme values decreases the probability of missed tunneling , which is @xmath54 for the square - wave signal . here , @xmath55 is the tunneling rate of eq .",
    "( [ rates ] ) of the wanted transition . at zero temperature , @xmath56 , where the electrostatic energy change @xmath57 of eq .",
    "( [ ech ] ) is roughly proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the probability of missed tunneling depends on the @xmath4 time constant as in normal - state devices .",
    "if the transition speed of the square - wave signal approaches @xmath59  ghz , the transistor can be excited to higher energy states , which causes errors .",
    "realistic pumping frequencies are , however , not close to this limit .",
    "the probability of an electron tunneling through the wrong junction due to thermal activation depends on the energy difference to the zero - bias case with no preferred tunneling direction : @xmath60 .",
    "this error leads to no net charge transferred during the cycle .",
    "on the other hand , if the bias point is close to the edge of the stability regions , @xmath61 , an excitation can cause an extra electron to transfer during the cycle .",
    "likewise , this error probability depends on the energy difference : @xmath62 . combining these equations ,",
    "we get @xmath46 as the optimum bias voltage , and a thermal error probability @xmath63 .",
    "the combined thermal error probability is less than @xmath3 at realistic temperatures of about 100  mk and with the gap of aluminum , @xmath642.3  k.    the most severe error source of the turnstile appears to be the different leakage processes .",
    "they involve elastic and inelastic higher - order tunneling processes . in the nisin case ,",
    "the dominant process is the elastic electron cotunneling that limits the accuracy to about @xmath65@xmath66 . in the sinis structure , the elastic higher - order processes are negligible .    the simplest inelastic process , cotunneling , is energetically forbidden by the bcs gap in the voltage range @xmath67 .",
    "the next - order processes are the andreev reflection and cooper - pair / electron cotunneling .",
    "the andreev reflection causes a higher error rate , but in the case @xmath68 , an optimum pumping sequence exists , where the andreev reflection vanishes . in the optimum sequence ,",
    "the bias voltage is @xmath46 , and the gate voltage is a square wave with offset @xmath69 and amplitude @xmath70 between @xmath71 .",
    "the amplitude should be closer to the upper end of this range to increase the tunneling rates . finally , the leakage is dominated by cooper - pair / electron cotunneling .",
    "reference  @xcite presents estimates for the obtainable error rates of the turnstile with different sample parameters .",
    "they are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : teorvirhe ] .",
    "the error decreases significantly , when the charging energy is increased over the bcs gap energy . at @xmath72 and with junction resistance 400  k@xmath73 , 30  pa can be reached with the error rate @xmath3 . if @xmath74 and resistance is 260  k@xmath73 , 100  pa can be reached with the same accuracy",
    ". these are still realistic parameters since they were reached , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the optimum resistance of the sample is a tradeoff between low leakage ( high resistance ) and low @xmath4 time constant .",
    "the absence of inelastic cotunneling allows to use lower resistance than in normal state devices .",
    "hence , the maximum current can be slightly higher than in normal - state pumps .",
    "also , the capacitance of the island can be very small , since coupling the gate voltage to the island does not create any cross coupling to other islands as in multi - island devices .",
    "the error rates presented in ref .",
    "@xcite do not include the cooper - pair breaking rate @xmath36 of eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) . however , there seems to be no experimental evidence of @xmath36 in the case of high - quality aluminum ; the leakages observed in experiments can be caused by andreev reflection , which also causes a linear leakage .",
    "in addition , nonidealities in tunnel barriers like pinholes can cause a linear leakage . in this paper , we use a general leakage parameter @xmath75 to avoid confusion with @xmath36 .",
    "note the factor of two difference in the coulomb - blockaded case between the leakage by @xmath76 and that of @xmath36 presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "let us consider also the change of the temperature of the normal - metal island during pumping .",
    "the superconducting leads are well thermalized to the base temperature of the cryostat , but the temperature of the electrons on the island can vary significantly .",
    "the heat fluxes arising from tunneling are proportional to the energy deposition and extraction rates of incoming and outgoing electrons : @xmath77\\\\ \\dot{q}^{i,-}=\\frac{\\delta^2}{e^2r_{\\mathrm{t},i}}\\int d\\epsilon ( \\epsilon+\\epsilon^{i,- } ) n_\\mathrm{s}(\\epsilon)f_\\mathrm{n}(\\epsilon+\\epsilon^{i,-})[1-f_\\mathrm{s}(\\epsilon ) ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the island can cool down at the first two current plateaus in a frequency range limited by the @xmath4 time constant  @xcite . at higher frequencies , the island is heated , which can increase the error rates . in the case",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath78  k@xmath73 , cooling is possible up to about 10  ghz , i.e. , at all envisioned pumping frequencies .",
    "the finite temperature of the island causes a maximum leakage of @xmath79 at @xmath53 , which is , however , negligible at about 100  mk .    it should also be noted that at higher current steps , the system should have enough time to set to each charge state between the extremes . a staircase - like waveform that waits at each integer gate charge would be equally good as the square wave that can be used at the first current plateau .",
    "however , the staircase - like waveform is not experimentally an obvious choice .",
    "thus , the first step is the most promising for metrology in this respect .",
    "the sample presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] was fabricated by electron beam lithography and two - angle evaporation on oxidized silicon wafer .",
    "we use the standard pmma and copolymer as resists .",
    "first , we evaporate the aluminum superconducting leads .",
    "next , we let oxygen in the vacuum chamber of the evaporator to oxidize the surface of the aluminum .",
    "the aluminum oxide acts as the tunnel barrier .",
    "finally , we evaporate copper in a different angle , and we get the same image of the mask as in the aluminum case , but shifted on the axis of the angle change . tunnel junctions with lateral size below @xmath80",
    "take form where the copper island touches the oxidized aluminum leads .",
    "due to the two - angle technique , we also get copper leads and an aluminum island , but the first ones are not connected , and the latter one touches the copper end of the gate line and thus becomes a part of the gate capacitor lead .",
    "the resistance of the sample was 475  k@xmath73 and the gate capacitance was 14  af . the charging energy was 2.2  k , which is of the order of the bcs gap .",
    "hence , the andreev reflection was still present , and metrological accuracy would not be possible with the present device . in the future",
    ", our process must be improved to be able to fabricate smaller junctions with high yield .",
    "one possibility is to use a germanium mask between pmma and the copolymer  @xcite .",
    "the sample was cooled down in a dilution refrigerator to a base temperature of about 60  mk .",
    "we used thermocoax  @xcite as the dc lines between the sample stage and the 1.5  k plate of the refrigerator .",
    "this is to avoid sub - gap leakage caused by photon - assisted tunneling arising from the high - frequency thermal noise that always exists in the higher temperature parts of the measurement circuit .",
    "furthermore , we added 550  @xmath73 resistors on the sample stage on each side of the sample to reduce noise at lower frequencies .",
    "the gate couples to the sample only via weak capacitances .",
    "hence , the noise properties of the gate line are not as critical as those of the dc lines .",
    "the measured dc iv curve of the sample is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivyloszoom ] .",
    "the @xmath76 parameter of the sample is clearly below @xmath81 , which is a significant improvement to the previous measurements with @xmath82  @xcite . in the sinis coolers with large junctions",
    ", the leakage is typically between @xmath83 and @xmath84 even with highly filtered dc lines similar to ours .",
    "the coulomb blockade suppresses the leakage caused by the cooper - pair breaking only by a factor of two .",
    "hence , our measurement supports the judgement of the theoretical work  @xcite that the leakage is usually caused by the andreev reflection .",
    "large junctions might also have pinholes that are statistically less probable in our case with small junctions .",
    "the measurement presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivyloszoom ] shows clearly that verifying the extremely low leakages , promised by the theory , will be an experimental challenge .",
    "already at the present stage we are limited by the noise of the current measurement .",
    "pumping results of the sinis turnstile at 10  mhz are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dkuvat ] .",
    "we observe broad quantized current plateaus as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this time with a sinis structure",
    ". however , the high - frequency gate line did not function perfectly in the present measurement . above 20  mhz ,",
    "the gate signal was significantly weakened by the line . even at lower frequencies ,",
    "the gate signal appeared to heat the sample , which rounds the edges of the current plateaus to some extent .",

    "@xcite requires a broad bandwidth for the higher harmonics of the pumping frequency , we did not try to employ it here .",
