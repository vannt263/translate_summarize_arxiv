    "generally , cqms are specified by a confining interaction and an interaction responsible for the hyperfine splitting of the baryon spectra .",
    "there has been a number of different implementations of hyperfine ( and confining ) interactions , and some prominent models are based on one - gluon - exchange ( oge )  @xcite , instanton - induced ( ii )  @xcite , and goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) dynamics  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have presented relativistic calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay widths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances within the point - form spectator model ( pfsm ) , and it has been seen that the experimental data are systematically underestimated  @xcite .",
    "similar characteristics of these decay widths have been found by the bonn group following a completely different relativistic approach , namely with the ii cqm in the framework of the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of mesonic baryon decays along cqms essentially employed nonrelativistic or relativised methods  @xcite .",
    "our investigations of hadronic decays within the point form have now been extended to the nonstrange decays of strange resonances  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay widths exhibit similar characteristics as the ones in the light sector  @xcite .",
    "a specific interpretation has been reached with regard to the three @xmath4 @xmath5 levels produced by cqms ( below 2 gev ) : only the third excitation ( in the gbe cqm ) should be identified with the measured @xmath5(1750 ) resonance .      motivated by the consistent picture that arose from the pfsm results for hadronic decay widths we undertook a classification of the mass - operator eigenstates into flavour multiplets according to their most congruent behaviour of spatial densities , spin as well as flavour content , mass relations , and decay properties .",
    "a natural pattern of flavour multiplets emerges that comprises also experimentally less well established ( i.e. , two - star ) resonances .",
    "the resulting multiplets are summarized in table  [ tab : tab1 ] . in the first column",
    "the total spin and parity @xmath6 of the flavour multiplet members are given as well as the total orbital angular momenta @xmath7 and total spins @xmath8 specifying their wave functions in the rest frame .",
    "the bold - face entries denote states where our classification differs from the one by the pdg  @xcite , and the last column refers to the multiplet number according to the classification of guzey and polyakov  @xcite .",
    "this classification is nearly identical to ours .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath9 , which turns out to be a flavour singlet ( with a percentage of 92% ) rather than a flavour octet .",
    "the pdg suggests a classification of baryons without consideration of one- and two - star resonances  @xcite .",
    "the proposed scheme closely resembles the one by samios et al .",
    "@xcite postulated already in 1974 , when many of the resonances known today have not yet been confirmed . in the context of modern relativistic cqms",
    "one learns that also less well established resonances of two - star status should be included into a classification of flavour multiplets .",
    "a prominent example is the @xmath5(1750 ) , which is to be identified only with the third @xmath4 excitation in cqms and turns out to be in a flavour decuplet .    , @xmath5 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 spectra for oge ( left ) and gbe ( right ) cqms .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=264 ] , @xmath5 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 spectra for oge ( left ) and gbe ( right ) cqms . , title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]    the octet states in table  [ tab : tab1 ] have a pure or very predominant octet flavour content , with the notable exceptions of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; the latter couple strongly to singlet states .",
    "the state @xmath9 is identified as a ( nearly pure ) singlet state in concordance with a recent large-@xmath14 study  @xcite .",
    "the other two singlets exhibit considerable admixtures of octet contributions , congruent with the singlet contributions of their partners in the octet multiplets .",
    "it should also be noted that the classification of the @xmath10(1950 ) as @xmath15 is different from a recent one by zhou and ma  @xcite , who classified it as a @xmath16 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplet ] we show all the experimental resonance states ( shadowed boxes ) employed for the classification of the mass eigenstates produced by the gbe and oge cqms ( horizontal lines ) . specifically in the @xmath5 excitation spectrum with @xmath17 a natural explanation of the states",
    "is found , if in addition to the @xmath5(1750 ) also the two lower lying states are included , which are seen in experiment as two - star resonances .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ordering of the three @xmath5 states with @xmath17 is different in the two cqms , namely octet - decuplet - octet for the oge and octet - octet - decuplet for the gbe . only in the @xmath5 spectrum with @xmath16 and the @xmath10 spectrum with @xmath17we",
    "still observe more theoretical states than experimentally seen resonances .",
    "however , at least in case of the @xmath5 the pdg expects a resonance in the relevant mass range .",
    "we have investigated the properties of the light and strange baryons obtained with the relativistic oge and gbe cqms .",
    "it has been found that the cqms provide a high degree of systematics with regard to the spectroscopy : the invariant mass eigenstates yield a consistent pattern of flavour multiplets .",
    "in particular , the @xmath5(1750 ) is identified as a flavour decuplet .",
    "additional two - star resonances can be interpreted consistently .",
    "a new classification is reached differing in some respects from the one by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one faces difficulties in the description of baryon reactions .",
    "in particular , the predictions of covariant decay widths along the pfsm can not explain all of the experimental results .",
    "further relativistic studies are necessary . in particular",
    ", investigations on the intricacies of the pfsm construction  @xcite might be of further relevance . for a more refined approach the inclusion of explicit mesonic degrees of freedom appears mandatory .",
    "investigative coupled - channel calculations in a poincar - invariant quantum - mechanical framework have already been performed in the meson sector  @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of this approach still prevents the application to baryons . for including mesonic degrees of freedom in the description of baryons , a promising first step would be to take into account appropriate contributions ( similar to the ones derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ) directly on the baryon - meson level .",
    "this work was supported by the austrian science fund ( projects fwf - p16945 and fwf - p19035 ) .",
    "b. s. acknowledges support through the doktoratskolleg graz `` hadrons in vacuum , nuclei and stars '' ( fwf - dk w1203 ) .",
    "we like to thank f. stancu for pointing out the classification of the @xmath18(1810 ) as a singlet in the study of ref  @xcite ."
